Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2020 
No. 4 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 8, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
AIRSTRIKE AGAINST GENERAL 
SOLEIMANI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, in re-
sponse to a successful, precise United 
States airstrike against Iranian ter-
rorist General Soleimani, a strike that 
was carefully thought out, that was 
vetted, that was carefully planned by 
our President, the Secretary of State, 
White House leadership, and the Pen-
tagon, my Democrat colleagues are 
threatening to force a vote to restrict 
our President’s ability to exercise his 
constitutional powers as Commander 
in Chief and, thus, place more Amer-
ican lives at risk. 
Listen, I don’t want a war. The Presi-
dent doesn’t want a war. Many, many 
Kansans I have talked to, they don’t 
want any more American lives lost in 
an endless war in the Middle East. But 
what Kansans do want is a President 
who draws a red line and actually 
means it, that if you harm an Amer-
ican or any American interests, we will 
respond swiftly, decisively, and, yes, 
disproportionately. 
For Kansans, it is pure and simple 
common 
sense 
that 
the 
American 
President protect our country, protect 
our people from imminent threats 
posed by those who seek to do us harm. 
If you are a known terrorist who has 
brutality murdered hundreds of Amer-
ican soldiers and is actively planning 
to kill more Americans, our leaders, 
our President has the authority to 
quickly stop that threat by any means 
necessary. This power is a core execu-
tive function of the Commander in 
Chief under Article II of the Constitu-
tion. 
This resolution that may be offered 
by Democrats today—and I say ‘‘may.’’ 
It sounds like now they are back-walk-
ing it, that they have probably done 
some type of a polling or some type of 
a study group that says this is not 
going to poll very well. But they have 
been threatening to offer a resolution 
that would undermine the President’s 
ability to swiftly respond to Iran and 
its proxies’ acts of aggression against 
our Nation and our interests. In other 
words, it would undermine the Presi-
dent’s ability to protect our homeland 
and protect the American people. 
By eliminating Soleimani, President 
Trump took decisive action to protect 
Americans and to rid the world of an 
evil terrorist who was actively plan-
ning more death and destruction. The 
President was doing his job to deesca-
late a very tense situation, to save 
American lives, and was damn right to 
do so. We are all safer today. 
SPEAKER PELOSI’S REFUSAL TO TRANSMIT 
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, after 
the unprecedented impeachment witch 
hunt conducted in the Chamber this 
past year, Speaker PELOSI has still not 
transmitted the sham Articles of Im-
peachment to the Senate. This would 
seem to fly in the face of common 
sense, the Constitution, and precedent. 
It is not just Republicans who have 
been saying how ridiculous this is. 
Speaker PELOSI’s refusal to transmit 
the articles is now coming under scru-
tiny from her own fellow Democrats in 
the Senate. One Senator said, ‘‘She 
should send the articles over’’; another, 
‘‘Let us do what we have to do over 
here’’; and, finally, a third Democratic 
Senator, ‘‘I’m hoping they will come 
over here soon. I think most people are 
ready to get this moving on.’’ 
The only thing that Speaker PELOSI’s 
3-week charade has done is show the 
public the weakness of Democrats’ case 
and show, indeed, he has not been given 
a safe political process and it is all for 
theater. 
Please, Ms. PELOSI, please, Speaker 
PELOSI, allow the Senate to get on with 
the people’s work: to pass USMCA, to 
lower healthcare costs, and to improve 
our infrastructure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H16 
January 8, 2020 
old died suddenly and unexpectedly. 
She was born at 11:25 a.m. on August 
31, 2015, a happy and healthy 6-pound, 
4-ounce, 20-inch-long baby. 
This vibrant little girl loved her 
mama and her dada and her pets. 
Scarlett loved books. She could read 
for hours. Her favorite book was 
‘‘Barnyard Dance!’’ by Sandra Boyn-
ton. She loved and she was loved. 
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated 
story. Each year, hundreds of children 
die unexpectedly and their deaths go 
unexplained, even after an investiga-
tion. Each year, nearly 3,500 children 
up to age 1 die suddenly. Among in-
fants, my colleagues may have heard of 
the leading cause being SIDS, Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome. 
These devastated families want an-
swers 
which, 
unfortunately, 
don’t 
come. One reason is that States and 
municipalities all over the country col-
lect inconsistent and often incomplete 
data 
on 
these 
unexplained 
sudden 
deaths; and, even with these efforts, 
they are irreconcilable. 
If we can’t even collect good and con-
sistent data, how can we expect to re-
verse this trend or even prevent it? 
Mr. Speaker, we can and we must do 
more to save the lives of our most vul-
nerable, which is why I introduced the 
Scarlett’s Sunshine on Sudden Unex-
pected Death Act, H.R. 2271, named in 
honor of little Scarlett. This bill would 
authorize efforts to improve the inves-
tigation of these deaths nationwide to 
help find answers that can guide pre-
vention efforts. 
It would also support better data ini-
tiatives of safe sleep education and 
other efforts to prevent such deaths 
and 
support 
for 
grieving 
families, 
among other provisions. 
Mr. Speaker, I was so inspired to do 
this because I have, in fact, been to the 
homes of grieving parents who have 
lost their child to sudden infant death. 
I am so grateful that this is bipar-
tisan legislation. There are 62 bipar-
tisan sponsors, and I just want to name 
a few of them on the other side. 
TOM COLE is the cosponsor on the Re-
publican side, along with JAIME HER-
RERA BEUTLER, who has given birth to 
three children since she has become a 
Member of this body, and CATHY 
MCMORRIS RODGERS, who is on the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
This bipartisan legislation has also 
been endorsed by the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, 
Children’s Hospital Association, Cribs 
for Kids, First Candle, SUDC Founda-
tion, KID: Fighting for Product Safety, 
Aaron Matthew SIDS Research Guild 
of Seattle Children’s Hospital, the 
Mackenzie Blair Foundation of New 
Jersey, Jaxin’s Cause in Ohio, the 
Scarlett Lillian Pauley Foundation, 
Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, and 
Safe Kids Worldwide. 
Today, the Health Subcommittee of 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee will hold hearings on this legis-
lation, bringing it one step closer to 
law. One of the witnesses will be 
Scarlett’s mom, someone who took her 
grief and turned it into activism, and I 
believe she is going to speak elo-
quently of the challenges that families 
across our country who experience 
such a tragedy face. 
Though Scarlett is gone, she is not 
forgotten. Passing this bipartisan bill 
is one way we can honor her and save 
lives. If this bill helps save one life— 
and I am confident that it will do more 
than that—it is worth it. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor 
this legislation.

CONGRATULATING REESE DEHEN 
ON 
HER 
OUTSTANDING 
ATH-
LETIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate an outstanding 
athlete from Anoka, Minnesota. 
Reese Dehen, this year, became a re-
peat State champion in swimming. She 
won the State swimming title in the 
Class AA 200 individual medley, and 
then the sophomore from Anoka con-
tinued to add a second State champion-
ship in the 100 breaststroke during the 
swimming State championships at the 
University of Minnesota. 
Reese is an outstanding young talent 
and one of Minnesota’s premier ath-
letes. She is also a role model for thou-
sands of young swimmers and student 
athletes who make the sacrifice to 
achieve the best they can be. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Reese 
and thank her for being a great role 
model. Our entire community is proud 
of her. 
HONORING CHRISTOPHER STEWART, AN 
OUTSTANDING EDUCATOR 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Christopher Stewart of 
North Lakes Academy charter school 
in Forest Lake, Minnesota. Mr. Stew-
art took learning to a new level this 
past year, participating in a program 
designed to preserve and amplify the 
history of fallen U.S. service personnel. 
For an entire year, Mr. Stewart re-
searched the life and service of Richard 
Willard Moody, a fallen World War II 
hero of the United States Army’s 129th 
Aero Squadron assigned to the French 
Escadrille Br. 129. Mr. Moody was from 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and he fought 
bravely on behalf of the United States 
before making the ultimate sacrifice in 
France. 
Sponsored by National History Day, 
in conjunction with the U.S. World War 
I 
Centennial 
Commission 
and 
the 
Pritzker Military Museum and Library, 
Mr. Stewart brought history to life and 
revived and preserved the memory of 
Richard Willard Moody. In fact, he 
even traveled to France to give a 
graveside eulogy and, when he returned 
to the United States, used this experi-
ence to teach his students. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stewart for 
remembering a fallen hero and pre-
serving his legacy. His students are 
lucky to have him and so is Min-
nesota’s Sixth Congressional District. 
HONORING STAN NELSON, A MINNESOTA HERO 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Stan Nelson for his dec-
ades of service to the United States 
and to the city of Anoka, Minnesota. 
Stan is well known throughout his 
community as a man of faith, family, 
and football. Some know Stan as 
‘‘Coach.’’ Others know him as ‘‘Lieu-
tenant Junior Grade.’’ Others know 
Stan as a Minnesota Senior Olympic 
gold medalist. Today, we add ‘‘Hero’’ to 
the list of titles that accompany his 
name. 
Stan was a student and football play-
er at Augsburg College who went on to 
enlist in the Navy following the bomb-
ing of Pearl Harbor. Stan operated one 
of the first boats to land on Omaha 
Beach on D-day. 
Following his service in World War 
II, Stan went on to coach the Anoka 
High School football team for 26 years, 
becoming a legend in Anoka and a 
mentor for generations of players. In 
honor of his repeated sacrifices, Haven 
for Heroes, a local nonprofit that pro-
vides transitional housing for veterans, 
recently dedicated their auditorium in 
honor of Stan. 
Men like Stan deserve to be honored. 
He has lived a life as a servant leader. 
And at age 99, he hasn’t slowed down. 
Mr. Speaker, we are honored that 
Stan’s name will forever adorn the 
Haven for Heroes auditorium, and I 
thank him for his service to Anoka and 
to his country. 
RECOGNIZING STARKEY HEARING TECHNOLOGIES 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Starkey Hearing 
Technologies, a Minnesota-based man-
ufacturer of hearing aids, for earning a 
place on Time magazine’s list of Best 
2019 Inventions. 
Starkey’s invention of the Livio AI 
hearing aid not only provides users 
with improved hearing quality, but it 
also tracks an individual’s body and 
brain health. 
This device, in addition, has several 
features that apply to our fast-paced 
world: It can stream music; it can act 
like a smart assistant; and it can even 
translate languages. 
Minnesota is proud of its many 
innovators 
and 
inventors. 
From 
Medtronic’s pacemaker to Starkey’s 
cutting-edge 
hearing 
devices, 
Min-
nesota remains one our country’s pre-
mier medtech hubs. 
I congratulate Starkey for its amaz-
ing contribution to hearing health for 
patients across the country. Minneso-
tans are proud that they call our great 
State home.

ADDRESSING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES FOR 
AMERICAN FARMS 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise

the Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act, H.R. 5038.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H17 
January 8, 2020 
NEWHOUSE, and my colleagues from 
across the aisle for working in good 
faith in search of a solution to a long-
standing issue in our agricultural com-
munity. 
Workforce shortages are crippling 
our most important industries. In the 
Sixth District of Minnesota, agri-
culture and manufacturing have suf-
fered the most. Farmers need assur-
ances they will be able to maintain 
their farm over the long term and that 
includes having a reliable workforce. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 5038 fell short of 
addressing key changes to our tem-
porary worker visa programs. 
While we have more work to do, I ap-
preciate my colleagues’ efforts to find 
solutions to the challenges. 
f 
HAVE A FAIR TRIAL IN THE 
SENATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise because I love my coun-
try. 
I rise today with my mnemonic notes 
in hand to discuss impeachment. As we 
all know, there is an expectation of a 
trial in the Senate. The people of the 
United States of America expect a fair 
trial, not a fake trial. 
Well, what is a fake trial? A fake 
trial exists when you have the equiva-
lent of the foreperson of the jury indi-
cating that he is coordinating efforts 
and working with the person who is ac-
cused; that is the President. The ma-
jority leader is indicating that he is 
working with the President, and he is a 
part of the jury. That is a fake trial. 
You have a fake trial when you don’t 
allow material, relevant witnesses to 
come forth and give their testimony. It 
is undisputed. 
It is agreed to by most persons with 
some understanding of what is going 
on, that Mr. John Bolton, the National 
Security Advisor, former, is a material 
witness and should be heard. He has 
not been heard and has indicated that 
he will testify if subpoenaed. Mr. 
Bolton ought to be subpoenaed and he 
ought to be heard so that we can have 
a fair trial; not a fake trial. 
It won’t be a trial. Here is what it 
will be: It will be a briefing. If you sim-
ply call the Members to order, Mr. Ma-
jority Leader, and if you simply read 
what has been presented to you from 
the House, that is nothing more than a 
briefing. 
And if the end result is something 
other than the President being con-
victed, all you have done is postpone 
justice. That is it. You are just post-
poning justice, but you also have done 
one additional thing. You will have 
said to the people of this country that 
the balance of power that you are there 
to protect is something that you would 
neglect. 
The balance of power is something 
that we must have if we are not to have 
a monarchy. If we are to maintain de-
mocracy, there has to be a balance of 
power. The House of Representatives 
has to have the opportunity to inves-
tigate. The President blocked wit-
nesses, blocked evidence that is of an-
other nature—written evidence, if you 
will. 
He has blocked evidence and wit-
nesses, and witnesses are evidence, and 
we and the Members of the House have 
impeached him—and he will be im-
peached forever, by the way. We have 
impeached him for impeding a congres-
sional investigation. 
In so doing, we expect the Senate to 
at least protect the balance of power. 
That is what the House is here for. We 
are the sword of Damocles when it 
comes to the President. We are there, 
hanging there to let him know that he 
can be punished in the Senate by virtue 
of the House having impeached—pun-
ished in the sense that he will be re-
moved from office, not in the sense 
that he would ever go to jail. 
Finally this, on the question of war 
or peace: Mr. President, I believe Iran 
has given you an off-ramp. I think you 
ought to take the off-ramp that is 
going to lead to deescalation because it 
also leads to the road of peace. 
I am a person who believes in peace. 
Choose peace. Choose the off-ramp that 
has been given to you and give us an 
opportunity to move forward with the 
work of the country. You will still be 
impeached, however. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
SUPPORT LIFESAVING AGENT 
ORANGE BILLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to the 
thousands of Vietnam war veterans 
who served our country but are unable 
to receive the VA benefits they earned 
and were promised. 
When Mr. Bill Rhodes from Mena, Ar-
kansas, first reached out to my office 
several years ago, his case seemed sim-
ple. He just needed our assistance in 
filing a benefits claim with the VA. 
But we soon learned he wasn’t eligible 
because the VA didn’t extend the pre-
sumption of Agent Orange exposure to 
veterans who served in Thailand during 
the Vietnam war. 
Mr. Rhodes isn’t a unique case. There 
are thousands of other veterans across 
the country who put their lives on the 
line during the Vietnam war. They 
made it home safely, only to learn 
years later that exposure to Agent Or-
ange was making them sick. 
Military personnel involved with the 
storage and transportation of Agent 
Orange suffered the worst rates of ex-
posure. The average concentration of 
the toxic chemical was 13 times the 
recommended rate for domestic use. 
Despite constant reassurance that it 
was safe and harmless to handle during 
the war, veterans began reporting 
symptoms of lymphoma, leukemia, res-
piratory cancer, prostate cancer, diabe-
tes, digestive disorders, and other dis-
eases. 
Thanks to the passage of the Blue 
Water Navy Act last year, we are fi-
nally seeing progress as of January 1. 
Veterans who served off the coast of 
Vietnam are finally able to receive 
benefits for their exposure. 
This bill also included language I in-
troduced that extends benefits to chil-
dren born with spina bifida as a result 
of their parent’s exposure to toxic her-
bicides. 
The Blue Water Navy Act is a big win 
for many veterans, but our work is not 
finished. 
Mr. Horace Wynn, another Vietnam 
veteran in our district, reached out 
this past year regarding his diagnosis 
and its relation to Agent Orange. 
Mr. Wynn’s advocacy is why I intro-
duced 
the 
bipartisan 
Keeping 
Our 
Promises Act, which would make an 
additional nine medical conditions eli-
gible for benefits that stem from Agent 
Orange exposure. 
I also reintroduced a bill from the 
115th Congress, H.R. 2201, that would 
allow Vietnam-era veterans who served 
in Thailand to apply for benefits based 
on exposure to Agent Orange. This bill 
is a direct result of my conversations 
with Mr. Rhodes, and Arkansas Sen-
ator JOHN BOOZMAN has introduced the 
same legislation in the Senate. 
Veteran 
organizations 
across 
the 
country are mailing letters of support 
in orange envelopes to their elected 
Representatives, urging them to sup-
port these lifesaving bills. The least we 
can do is listen. But we should do 
more. We must pass these bills for our 
Nation’s veterans. They deserve it. 
Our men and women in uniform put 
their lives on the line to serve their 
country. In return, we promised that 
we would provide assistance for their 
medical bills and benefits. It is past 
time we keep those promises. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in 
both the House and the Senate to join 
me in getting these bills passed and 
signed into law. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to talk about the impending impacts of 
climate change on our planet and the 
unquestionable impact that all of us 
are aware of. 
Over the world, we see prolonged 
droughts fueling disastrous fires. Over 
the last 6 months we have watched hor-
rific bushfires in Australia with tre-
mendous losses. People have died, half 
a billion animals have been lost, and 
millions of acres of land have been 
swallowed up by flames. 
As a lifelong resident of California, I 
have witnessed similar devastation in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H18 
January 8, 2020 
our own communities as a result of cli-
mate change. The past 2 years alone 
were the two worst fire seasons on 
record. Climate change has, no doubt, 
heightened the impact of these fires 
which is why we are witnessing these 
horrific impacts, and they are so dif-
ficult to manage. 
Climate change is happening now and 
we must do more. For starters, we 
must continue to make significant ef-
forts to reduce our carbon footprint. 
We must continue to invest in clean air 
and affordable transportation made 
more readily available to all of our 
communities throughout the country. 
Last year, the House took strong 
steps to protect our planet in the fu-
ture by passing H.R. 9, the Climate Ac-
tion Now Act. H.R. 9 confronts the cli-
mate crisis by keeping us in the Paris 
Agreement, and demanding a plan of 
action from the administration to par-
ticipate in a meaningful fashion. But 
that bill, along with hundreds of oth-
ers, are currently sitting on Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
desk 
collecting 
dust, 
sadly. 
These current events have made it 
clear that we have an imperative need 
to act on this climate crisis. And while 
we wait for the Senate to act, I am 
doing all that I can to make a dif-
ference in California as it relates to 
our air quality, transportation, and our 
water needs that are impacted. 
As a member of the State legislature, 
years ago, I created the San Joaquin 
Valley Air Pollution Control District 
to help monitor and reduce pollution in 
the valley and improve our air quality, 
and we have made progress. 
I am also the cosponsor and helped to 
introduce the Clean Corridors Act and 
the Clean School Bus Act that also re-
duced greenhouse gases. 
We have also helped kick-start Cali-
fornia’s High-Speed Rail project which 
will get millions of drivers out of their 
cars and into cleaner, more accessible 
transportation, along with our inner- 
city transportation, our intermodal 
concept to use all of the modes of 
transportation more effectively for 
cleaner air quality. 
I am also working on water legisla-
tion that will help improve conserva-
tion and work toward a sustainable 
water supply for our farmers and clean-
er water for our communities through-
out California. 
California’s broken water system is 
not suited to deal with the increased 
volatility caused by climate change. 
For those of you who are unaware, 
California gets most of its water, its 
moisture, 
between 
November 
and 
March. The rains are important. They 
are critical, and the snow in the moun-
tains are Mother Nature’s icebox. 
With climate change, we see the 
droughts have become longer and more 
intense, and the storms that we rely on 
for the snowpack are fewer and are at 
a higher elevation, which means this 
incredible water system that we have 
created over the last 100 years has to 
adapt to those changes. 
Food is a national security issue, not 
only in California, but in America and 
throughout the world. Without a reli-
able supply of water, we cannot grow 
food, not only for our Nation but for 
the planet, and so this is a critical 
issue. 
We need to understand that for 7 bil-
lion people on the planet in the last 2 
years—suggested to increase to 9 bil-
lion by the middle of this century—the 
ability to provide a sustainable water 
supply for the entire world and for us 
to grow food to feed our people in this 
country is absolutely critical. 
Therefore, we have a moral responsi-
bility to be good stewards of this plan-
et that we call home for ourselves and 
for the future generations to come. 
As we begin the new year, let’s work 
together now to find bipartisan, com-
monsense solutions to help us pass 
along a better planet for future genera-
tions to come. This, among all of the 
other difficult issues we face, I believe, 
is the primary challenge of the 21st 
century.

IMPORTANCE OF RURAL HEALTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the 
importance of rural health and what it 
means to the nearly 60 million Ameri-
cans who call rural America home. 
No matter where you live, access to 
quality healthcare should not be con-
sidered a luxury. Recently, a local hos-
pital in my district was recognized as a 
healthcare leader in rural America. 
The University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center, Northwest campus in Venango 
County was one of 18 rural hospitals in 
the Nation to receive an award for ex-
cellence and patient safety and quality 
in 2019. 
The accolade is given annually by 
The Leapfrog Group serving more than 
2,100 hospitals to find the Nation’s best 
in healthcare safety and quality. 
Hospitals like UPMC Northwest are 
just one piece of the puzzle when it 
comes to building a network of reliable 
care in rural America. 
In many cases, rural residents can 
still live very far away from the closest 
hospital, which makes getting quality 
care even more difficult. 
Telehealth can help reduce barriers 
to health services for all residents, par-
ticularly the elderly, and those with 
limited mobility. The Northwest cam-
pus of UPMC has been a leader in tele-
health and telemedicine. 
Telehealth options are becoming in-
creasingly available in not only rural 
communities, but across the country. 
Ninety percent of healthcare execu-
tives say their organizations are devel-
oping or already offer telehealth serv-
ices, and in 2018, approximately 7 mil-
lion individuals took advantage of a 
telehealth consultation. 
b 1030 
Telehealth services are a great tool 
for those who may live far away from a 
hospital, but it also takes much of the 
hassle out of scheduling an appoint-
ment and makes routine care much 
more efficient. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been proud to as-
sist in leading the advancement of tele-
health and telemedicine legislatively 
in this body, including the STEP Act, 
which greatly expanded access to tele-
medicine to our Active Duty military, 
Reserve, and Guard. That was signed 
by President Obama in the VETS Act, 
which did the same thing for our Amer-
ican veterans under the VA MISSION 
Act signed by President Trump. 
As we continue to explore ways to in-
crease access, affordability, quality, 
and basic choice, telehealth or tele-
medicine must be a part of that con-
versation. 
f 
GIVE PEACE A CHANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘All is 
well!’’ ‘‘So far, so good!’’ 
This is the latest sequel in Trump’s 
government-by-tweets, that couldn’t be 
further from reality. Hopefully, we 
pray that no American lives were lost 
last night. But every American is less 
safe today than before Trump’s assas-
sination of a major foreign leader. He 
has taken us to the brink of war, and, 
hopefully, he will use the opportunity 
of a restrained counterattack not to es-
calate further but to seek an off-ramp 
to deescalate the crisis that could en-
danger the world. 
Attack begetting attack, and hate 
begetting hate—in that direction lies 
the abyss. The only justification that 
he can offer for ignoring President 
Ronald 
Reagan’s 
Executive 
Order 
against assassination of foreign leaders 
is that of an imminent attack, that we 
need to get them before they get us. He 
has failed to offer any such evidence of 
an imminent attack to justify this rash 
assassination that previous adminis-
trations, Republican and Democrat, 
and the Israelis who had the capacity 
to do this, recognized posed more dan-
ger than good. 
‘‘Overreliance on our packing the 
biggest gun and having the fastest 
draw as in some old John Wayne west-
ern movie does not truly make us 
safer. This is not a formula for the 
safety of our families. It is a formula 
for international anarchy. A quick 
draw may eliminate the occasional vil-
lain, but it comes at the cost of desta-
bilizing the world, disrupting the hope 
of international law and order, and, ul-
timately, it will make even Austin a 
very unsafe place in which to live.’’ 
Those were the precise words I used 
in challenging the horrendous Bush- 
Cheney invasion of Iraq, and they 
apply even more today to the war with 
Iran, a country that is about four times

the size and three times the population 
of prewar Iraq and has far more capac-
ity to do harm to us and our allies. 
Trump has no plan and no strategy in 
the Middle East. Ending one general’s 
life is not an endgame. Like the inva-
sion of Iraq, already the biggest winner 
from Trump’s misguided non-policy is 
the country that he opposes the most, 
Iran, whose allies now in Iraq have 
asked all of our troops to leave and 
who have called them occupiers; Iran, 
whose presence has caused the removal 
of all civilian employees and foreign 
service officers of the United States 
from Iraq. 
Now, with the assassination, Trump 
has united those who were once oppos-
ing the regime in Iran. In Iran, there 
are incredible protests, and in Iraq 
there are protests against Iranian in-
fluence. So after abandoning our Kurd-
ish allies and surrendering that part of 
the Middle East to our adversaries, 
Trump has now managed to unite the 
many people who were favorable to the 
United States and who were ques-
tioning the very malicious presence of 
Iran. 
I believe that Congress must act and 
this House must act to assert its con-
stitutional authority to rein in this 
out-of-control President. Last July, we 
attempted to do just that. I voted with 
a strong majority in this House to 
adopt the Khanna amendment to basi-
cally say that we would deny all funds 
for his attacking Iran without his com-
ing first to this Congress to justify it; 
and I supported a second amendment 
that was adopted by our colleague, 
Representative LEE, which made it 
clear that there is no authorization for 
use of military force that exists on the 
books today that justifies any offensive 
action against Iran. 
This 
House 
should 
use 
the 
full 
strength of our authority to restrict 
President Trump from rushing into an-
other war that will be so costly to us in 
blood and treasure. It is a war that 
American families do not want. 
As one very concerned father mov-
ingly wrote to me this week: ‘‘[If] my 
son is to be deployed to protect and 
serve our country, please do your best 
to be sure it is for the right reasons. He 
is proud to [serve] and will do his duty 
to the best of his ability without ques-
tion. His Mother and I could not be 
prouder. Please don’t let it be about 
some ill-conceived political distraction 
from an egomaniacal madman.’’ 
Let us come together to build a bet-
ter path forward. Let us give peace a 
chance. 
f 
SUPPORT DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
IN PUERTO RICO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) for 
5 minutes. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the people of Puerto Rico. They 
are still struggling from the aftermath 
of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and now are 
dealing with incessant seismic activity 
on the island since December 28 of last 
year. 
Puerto Ricans still need ongoing as-
sistance from Federal disaster pro-
grams, like those offered by FEMA and 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. Today, I would like to 
emphasize HUD’s work, particularly 
through its Community Development 
Block Grant program and the disaster 
relief program for Puerto Rico. 
Puerto Rico has an allotment of over 
$20 billion under CDBG-DR programs 
that will be spent on unmet needs and 
mitigation expenses to ensure local in-
frastructure is restored and in a better 
position to withstand future disasters. 
This clearly puts us in a positive posi-
tion to restore our housing stock, eco-
nomic activity, and damaged infra-
structure. 
However, of the $20 billion, only $1.5 
billion is currently available to be 
drawn down by the grantee, the Puerto 
Rico Department of Housing. Although 
this is a large amount, delays and 
other challenges have impeded the 
availability of these additional funds. 
To make matters worse, Puerto Rico 
has been experiencing a sequence of 
tremors since December 28, including a 
6.4 magnitude earthquake yesterday 
during the early morning and a replica 
of 6.0 in the morning as well. The 
earthquake and subsequent aftershocks 
have caused significant housing and in-
frastructure damages in the south part 
of our island, including the towns of 
Guanica, Guayanilla, Penuelas, and 
Ponce, among others. 
My constituents are afraid and un-
certain of when these occurrences will 
cease, and the reason for that is ap-
proximately more than 400 people are 
still in shelters. One death has been re-
ported. Additionally, there was an im-
mediate power outage that impacted 
the entire island. As we speak, 75 per-
cent of the island is without power and 
without electricity. 
I commend President Trump for sign-
ing the Federal emergency declaration 
last night. It is clear that the people of 
Puerto Rico will need Federal assist-
ance to fully assess damages, recover, 
and prepare for other future events. 
According to the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, aftershocks and an increase in 
overall seismic activity are expected 
throughout the next week, including a 
chance of another large earthquake 
that could cause additional damage. I 
am confident that we will show the 
strength and resiliency once more in 
the face of another disaster, but we 
cannot do it alone. 
That is the reason, when you see 
schools that were impacted on the is-
land, crushing one of the schools in 
Guanica—thank God there were no 
kids present at that time. Because the 
Governor resumed order, the classes 
were suspended, and we saved a lot of 
lives in that school. 
But we can’t do it alone. That is the 
reason we need to secure proper dis-
bursement of funds requiring planning 
and preparation, and we must ensure 
local agencies in Puerto Rico, like the 
Department of Housing, are equipped 
to manage and oversee the funds. 
Therefore, I understand bolstering ca-
pabilities, 
and 
I 
understand 
the 
changes and challenges. We need im-
provement, but I do not understand the 
repeated delays, the lack of informa-
tion, and the violation of congression-
ally mandated deadlines for the CDBG- 
DR funds. 
Mr. Speaker, whatever changes or 
improvements need to be made must be 
made within the bounds, guidelines, 
and deadlines set forth by Congress to 
the Federal agencies. Puerto Rico is 
currently waiting for an agreement for 
an additional allotment of $8 billion for 
unmet needs, which already has an ap-
proved action plan and now needs a 
signed agreement for that money, in-
cluding $2 billion for restoring our de-
pleted power grid. These are urgent 
needs at this time. 
f 
CONGRESS SHALL HAVE POWER 
TO DECLARE WAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, for the last 
2 months, the House has been riven by 
the process of impeachment. It has 
been emotional, divisive, and chal-
lenging. If you noticed, many of the 
statements about impeachment started 
with some version of this: Impeach-
ment is the most serious thing that 
Congress will do, other than declare 
war. 
Well, here we are. In the next day, in 
the next month, and in the next year, 
this body may be called upon to make 
decisions that will alter history and 
possibly send young men and women to 
their deaths or not. I say ‘‘or not’’ be-
cause, once again, I see Congress at 
risk of failing to stand up for the clear 
mandate placed on us by the Constitu-
tion, to which each and every one of us 
took an oath. 
There is no argument about our duty 
here. The language of the Constitution 
is plain: Congress shall have power to 
declare war, not Congress shall have 
power to declare war unless the Presi-
dent wants to retaliate against some-
one; not Congress shall have power to 
declare war unless a Syrian airbase 
needs destruction; not Congress shall 
have power to declare war unless our 
forces are attacked in the Tonkin Gulf. 
Congress shall have power to declare 
war. Period, full stop. 
Mr. Speaker, in the long run, this has 
nothing to do with our confidence in a 
particular President. It has everything 
to do with whether we take the obliga-
tions that Mr. Madison and Mr. Ham-
ilton asked us to take seriously. In 
their wisdom, the Founders understood 
that 
every 
American—every 
Amer-
ican—should have a voice in the deci-
sion to go to war because it will be 
those Americans who offer up their

sons and their daughters; because it 
will be those Americans and their chil-
dren who will sacrifice not just them-
selves but the roads, the bridges, the 
schools, and the scholarships that will 
get consumed in the costs of war; and 
because our Founders understood that 
the true power of our awesome war ma-
chine was not in the technology. It lay 
in the sober assent and careful enthu-
siasm of millions of Americans, not in 
the decision of one person in an Oval 
Office. 
So, here we are. Yes, the questions 
are many and complicated. Was the 
strike on General Soleimani legal? Was 
it ethical? Was it smart? These are not 
easy questions, and I suspect the an-
swers will come only over time and 
after careful study. But right now, in 
this there is a question that hangs the 
lives of our people and potentially tril-
lions of dollars: What comes next? 
For those of us who were chanting, 
cheerleading, and whipping themselves 
into a belligerent frenzy, reflect on our 
experience over the last 20 years in 
places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
Libya. Comments by the Secretary of 
Defense notwithstanding, that we are 
not looking to start a war, but we are 
prepared to end one, the experience of 
the last 20 years is that we are not pre-
pared to end any war. Some estimates 
suggest that we have spent $6 trillion 
on Middle Eastern wars, and more im-
portantly, we have laid down the lives 
of thousands of our men and women. 
While we may have taken some satis-
faction from the removal of people like 
Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qa-
dhafi, at what cost? One of our most 
accomplished 
Middle 
Eastern 
dip-
lomats, Philip Gordon, answers that 
question best. Philip Gordon wrote this 
years ago: ‘‘In Iraq, the U.S. intervened 
and occupied, and the result was a 
costly disaster. In Libya, the U.S. in-
tervened and did not occupy, and the 
result was a costly disaster. In Syria, 
the U.S. neither intervened nor occu-
pied, and the result is a costly dis-
aster.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I close my plea for care, 
thoughtfulness, and careful consider-
ation by reminding my colleagues of a 
friend who died almost exactly a year 
ago, Walter B. Jones, Jr., from North 
Carolina. Some of us in this Chamber 
remember his journey. 
b 1045 
In 2003, he was an ardent supporter of 
the Iraq war; and over time and, in par-
ticular, when he attended the funeral 
for a young sergeant in his district, he 
came to regret his decision. This was 
the guy who led the charge to rename 
French fries ‘‘freedom fries,’’ and he 
came to be haunted by what he had 
done and by what we had done. 
I didn’t know Walter well, but we 
celebrated his life when he died. Let’s 
be like Walter. Let’s learn the cost of 
war—but let’s not attend funerals to do 
it—and give this decision the careful 
consideration it deserves. 
TEPID ECONOMIC RESULTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as we 
begin the new year and the new decade, 
economic results feel tepid for working 
communities across our country. 
The President touts and newspapers 
parrot his misguided belief that Amer-
ica is experiencing the greatest econ-
omy for everyone. 
No, not for everyone. 
Sure, many indicators prioritized by 
Wall Street and Washington support 
and reflect this statement, but speak 
with millions and millions of lower and 
middle-class 
workers, 
Americans 
across our country—especially in the 
heartland, in the Midwest—and you 
will find they feel quite differently. 
They are falling deeper into debt. 
Despite President Trump’s exaggera-
tion, a soaring stock market is not in-
dicative of a strong economy for all. 
Most Americans do not have a signifi-
cant stake in the stock market. They 
work paycheck to paycheck. They have 
to pay higher prices for everything. 
According 
to 
fact-checkers 
at 
PolitiFact, Americans of modest in-
comes are significantly less invested in 
the stock market than wealthier Amer-
icans. 
No surprise there. 
Other groups, including minorities 
and those without a college education, 
also lag in stock ownership, meaning 
that the stock market rally President 
Trump and the Republican Party so 
loudly brag about misses—bypasses— 
the large majority of Americans. 
While unemployment numbers are 
relatively low, tens of millions of 
Americans continue to live and work 
below the poverty line. If you take 
look at their paycheck, many of them 
have to get food support through the 
government because they can’t make 
ends meet—working people who are 
poor, millions of them. 
Millions more are unemployed and 
working multiple jobs just to make 
ends meet for themselves and their 
families. Others have given up on find-
ing work altogether, especially in 
towns and cities, where good work has 
simply disappeared and not been re-
placed. These families simply exist. 
Since NAFTA’s passage in the early 
1990s, communities across America—es-
pecially in our industrial heartland— 
have endured the outsourcing of living- 
wage, middle-class jobs to Mexico and 
other penny-wage environments where 
workers are exploited to produce goods 
for pennies on the dollar. 
Because of disastrous trade policies 
such as NAFTA and lack of enforce-
ment by governments like Mexico, our 
young people have grown up in the 
shadows of shuttered factories they 
have never seen in operation. For too 
many, the pain of NAFTA’s and other 
trade agreements’ broken promises re-
main raw and real. 
So, while job creation numbers may 
be up in one place, one must wonder: 
What sort of jobs are being created and 
how many are good jobs? The answer 
is: not nearly enough. 
Many of the lost living-wage manu-
facturing jobs weren’t only outsourced 
to Mexico; others shifted to China. 
What has the President’s unpredict-
able posturing with China has given 
our heartland? Desperate farmers and 
even more pain for manufacturing 
workers. 
The 18-month-long trade war with 
China has undermined business invest-
ment. It pushed the manufacturing in-
dustry into a recession and cost an ad-
ditional $42 billion for American con-
sumers who have paid more for needed 
goods, according to a new Federal Re-
serve Bank study. 
This year brings small relief for the 7 
million lucky Americans who live in 
cities and States that will see wage in-
creases; but this is no thanks to the 
President or the Senate Republicans 
who still refuse to move the Raise the 
Wage Act the House passed last year 
for the millions of workers who live at 
the lowest level of paid wages in our 
country. 
Millions of American workers remain 
left behind by the $7.25 minimum wage, 
or $15,080 for a full year’s work, be-
cause the Federal minimum wage re-
mains 
stagnant. 
American 
workers 
haven’t had the benefit of a Federal 
minimum wage increase in over a dec-
ade, yet the prices of everything have 
gone 
up—right?—medicine, 
housing, 
food, cars, local taxes. 
There isn’t a single congressional dis-
trict in our Nation where a full-time 
minimum wage worker can afford a 
two-bedroom apartment. How about 
that? 
Factor 
in 
the 
rising 
cost 
of 
healthcare and education, and more 
American families continue to live at 
the breaking point and are going deep-
er into debt. This President continues 
to push for the repeal of the Affordable 
Care Act, despite no plan to replace it. 
Here is another example of President 
Trump and Senate Majority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s failure to act to 
support workers: Our House passed the 
Butch Lewis Act—with bipartisan sup-
port, it passed this Chamber—to ad-
dress the worsening multiemployer 
pension crisis. 
Currently, there are about 1,400 mul-
tiemployer plans covering nearly 10 
million people across our country who 
are retired—60,000 in Ohio alone. These 
plans are certain to run out of money 
to support those retirees. It is esti-
mated that 1.3 million retirees and 
workers are set to lose these benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, the Senate should pass 
the bill that we passed here for these 
retirees; and we all, as a country, 
should work to improve the economic 
outlook for millions and millions of 
working Americans who, frankly, are 
left out of this economy.

IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR 
YOUNG JUVENILES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me, first of all, say how grateful we are 
that, as the assessment has been made, 
none of our brave soldiers lost their 
lives last night in the Iranian attack 
and that it is crucial this week that 
this Congress assert its authority, its 
constitutional authority as it relates 
to any declaration of war, which is our 
authority under Article I, in spite of 
the unfortunate determination made 
by this administration putting Amer-
ican soldiers in danger, diplomats mak-
ing their families have great concern, 
and, certainly, jeopardizing the secu-
rity of the American people. 
Our soldiers, most of all, we respect 
and honor, but we must do our job. As 
we do that, it is important, as well, to 
recognize that our work must go on. 
Over the years, I have worked on any 
number of responses to improving the 
quality of life of our young juveniles. 
On any given day, over 48,000 youth in 
the United States are confined in fa-
cilities away from home as a result of 
the juvenile justice or criminal justice 
involvement. In many instances, they 
are not assigned a particular sentence 
and can stay incarcerated or detained 
until they are 21. Most are held in re-
strictive correctional-style facilities, 
and thousands are held without even 
having had a trial—no sentence. 
Mr. Speaker, 92 percent of youth in 
juvenile facilities are in locked facili-
ties. According to a 2018 report, 52 per-
cent of long-term secure facilities, 44 
percent of detention facilities, and 43 
percent of reception and diagnostic 
centers also use mechanical restraints 
like handcuffs, leg cuffs, restraining 
chairs, straightjackets, with 40 percent 
of long-term secure facilities and de-
tention centers isolating youth in 
locked rooms for 4 hours or more. 
In the State of Texas, we have had a 
long history with our foster care sys-
tem and our detention system where 
young 
people—juveniles—have 
been 
abused, sexually assaulted, and other 
indignities, altering them for life. 
According to selected findings from 
the Juvenile Residential Facility Cen-
sus released in December 2018, 46 per-
cent of all facilities reported locking 
youths in their rooms. Among public 
facilities, 81 percent of local facilities 
and 68 percent of State facilities re-
ported locking young people in sleep-
ing rooms. 
These young people are going to be 
the future leaders or the future citi-
zens, residents of this Nation. They 
will have to take their rightful place. 
This is wrong, and so I intend to in-
troduce an omnibus reformation of the 
juvenile justice system to reform it so 
that we can respond appropriately to 
these 48,000-plus and really restore 
their lives. 
I have already introduced legislation 
to ban solitary confinement, and lock-
ing juveniles in their rooms, lockdown, 
is equal to that. 
We don’t know the altering factor in 
the development of these young people. 
Studies have shown brains are not fully 
developed until the age of 25, and yet 
we put on the brains of these young 
people under 25 in the juvenile justice 
system the kinds of stimuli that would 
alter their life forever. 
We also want to address the question 
of juveniles having a future, to ban the 
box of having to admit being arrested 
or in a juvenile detention center. 
Remember, most of these juveniles 
have not had trials. They have not had 
due process. They don’t have a sen-
tence. They can remain in that facility 
until, in many instances, the age of 21 
if they came in at 12 or 14 a for non-
violent offense. 
Then, of course, we need to find al-
ternative places for juveniles to be able 
to have wraparound services that real-
ly restore them to being a full, young 
person who can enjoy life and get an 
education. 
Many times when juveniles are in ju-
venile detention centers, their edu-
cations are spotty, at best. They don’t 
return to the school system, and they 
are isolated and prone to dropping out. 
Yes, families need help. Families 
wind up in the juvenile justice system 
or the family court system out of des-
peration because we don’t have help for 
those families. 
We need wraparound services, sup-
port services, that will encourage and 
enhance family unity and the ability to 
address the needs of this young person. 
Maybe it is volatility, immaturity. 
Maybe it is a response to home life. 
Maybe it is because there is drug abuse 
in the family or criminal activity in 
the family, or maybe there is poverty 
in the family or one parent struggling 
to raise a number of children. 
We cannot abandon 48,000 children 
every year in this Nation, Mr. Speaker, 
and so I will introduce the omnibus re-
form bill of the juvenile justice system

U.S. SOLDIERS IN HARM’S WAY 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, 4,559 U.S. soldiers have been 
killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion 
and occupation. Despite their sac-
rifices, 17 years later, Iran now owns 
and controls Iraq today. 
2,430 U.S. soldiers have been killed in 
Afghanistan, and today we are negoti-
ating for peace with the Taliban, the 
terror organization that is most re-
sponsible for the killing of our soldiers. 
These wars have cost nearly $5 tril-
lion and have taken nearly 7,000 lives 
of U.S. soldiers. 
Before going after Qasem Soleimani, 
the 5,200 U.S. soldiers still stuck in 
Iraq should have been evacuated and 
out of harm’s way. But they weren’t. 
They were put in harm’s way by our 
Commander-in-Chief 
during 
Iran’s 
highly predictable retaliatory attack 
last night on U.S. military installa-
tions in Iraq.

H22 
January 8, 2020 
the Second Congressional District of 
South Carolina visiting the Midlands, 
Aiken, North Augusta, Barnwell, and 
Orangeburg to present my 2020 legisla-
tive agenda. 
At each stop, I was grateful to share 
my priorities and answer questions 
from the media. In this new legislative 
year, I will continue to advance legis-
lation to create jobs for American fam-
ilies and reduce the harmful regula-
tions that destroy jobs. 
I will promote working with local 
chambers and agencies. In 2020, I will 
advocate for future and current mis-
sions at the Savannah River Site and 
Savannah River National Laboratory. 
We also must protect the economic 
future for our children and grand-
children to address the debt by sup-
porting the most conservative budget 
options. I am also focusing on pro-
moting peace through strength to sup-
port our troops and keep American 
families safe by defeating terrorists 
overseas in the global war on ter-
rorism. 
This year, I will also serve as the 
ranking member of the Commission on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
where I will work with my colleagues 
across the aisle to maintain our inter-
national partnerships. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and may we never forget September 
the 11th in the global war on terrorism 
with the courageous leadership of 
President Donald Trump.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RON 
VOEGELI 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Ron 
Voegeli. He passed away on January 1. 
Ron was a devoted husband, father, 
grandfather, and Christian. He touched 
countless lives during his 30 years as a 
member of the Disabled American Vet-
erans, raising thousands of dollars to 
purchase vans to take vets to and from 
the VA, expanding the Beaufort Na-
tional Cemetery, and spending hours 
each week helping veterans fill out dis-
ability paperwork. 
If a Lowcountry vet passed away 
without family to attend the funeral, 
Ron became their family. He often ral-
lied hundreds of others to attend the 
burial or perform the ceremony him-
self. He believed that no veteran who 
sacrificed for their country should be 
laid to rest alone. 
When we die, we all hope to hear: 
‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant 
. . . Enter thou into the joy of thy 
Lord.’’ 
That is how Ron lived his life, and 
that is what he deserves. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN 
DALE DOSS 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor U.S. Navy Captain Dale Doss 
of Tallahassee who proudly served his 
Nation and passed from this life on De-
cember 11. 
Captain Doss was flying off the USS 
Enterprise when he was shot down dur-
ing his 54th mission over North Viet-
nam in 1968. He was held as a prisoner 
of war for 1,824 days before being re-
leased in March of 1973. 
While in the infamous Hanoi Hilton, 
he formed a close relationship with 
former Senator John McCain, commu-
nicating with him despite being tor-
tured for doing so. During the 2 years 
he spent in solitary confinement, he 
never broke faith with his fellow POWs 
or his country. 
Captain Doss retired from the Navy 
in 1983, but he never stopped serving. 
As the director of veteran services in 
Leon County for 19 years, he was an in-
tegral part of our community. 
Dale Doss will be remembered for his 
sacrifices and for his courageous serv-
ice to our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing a true American hero, Captain 
Dale Doss. 
f 
EPIDEMIC OF ANTI-JEWISH 
HATRED 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to highlight the epidemic 
of anti-Jewish hatred taking place in 
New York City and across the country. 
Since December 23, there have been 
over a dozen attacks on Jews across 
New York City; this, after a terror at-
tack in Jersey City that claimed three 
innocent lives and a horrific terrorist 
attack in Monsey, New York. 
In this city, where Jews have come 
for 366 years to freely practice their re-
ligion, enough is enough. Tweets and 
words of support are not enough at a 
time of crisis like this. We must have 
action. 
It is for that reason that on January 
15, 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
sub-
committee that I chair will hold a 
hearing on the rise of anti-Semitism. 
We have got to explore increased fund-
ing 
for 
mosques, 
synagogues, 
and 
churches; increase focus on a domestic 
terrorism charge; and increase focus on 
the rise of the neo-Nazi movement, 
both nationally and globally. 
Once again, tweets, thoughts, and 
prayers are not enough right now. We 
need action. 
f 
SUPPORTING BRAVE MEN AND 
WOMEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to support our brave men 
and women serving overseas, specifi-
cally, those in Iraq and the Middle 
East. 
I support their mission, as I did dur-
ing my time on Active Duty. I also rise 
to recognize all of those who have been 
working to support this mission, in-
cluding constituents of mine working 
at the National Ground Intelligence 
Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
I have personally worked, during my 
past, with NGIC on efforts to stop the 
Quds Force and Qasem Soleimani, spe-
cifically their support to IED tech-
nologies that killed American troops. 
Soleimani was a terrorist. 
The President recently addressed the 
Nation proposing an allied effort with 
our partners in NATO to address Iran 
and ensure they stop their pursuit of 
hegemonic goals and their nuclear pro-
gram. 
I 
support 
this 
effort. 
Resolute 
strength is the only way to deal with 
state sponsors of terrorism. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE EXEMPLARY 
CAREER OF TINA PANETTA 
(Mr. RASKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary ca-
reer of a very special constituent of 
mine named Tina Panetta who lives in 
Silver Spring and has been a public 
servant here on Capitol Hill for many 
decades. She is popularly known as 
‘‘Mother on the Hill.’’ 
Born in the small town of Ovindoli, 
Italy, Ms. Panetta came to the U.S. in 
1955 with her two sons and husband, 
Ettore, to seek a better life. Five years 
later, Tina became a citizen, and in 
January of 1961, she gave birth to her 
youngest child, Maria Teresa. 
In 1968, despite being unable to read, 
write, or speak English, she began serv-
ing as a waitress in the U.S. Senate 
cafeteria. Over the course of her dec-
ades-long career on Capitol Hill, Tina 
touched the lives of Senators, Rep-
resentatives, Vice Presidents, Presi-
dents, and their families. 
When Tina sprained her ankle, then- 
Vice President Hubert Humphrey ac-
companied her to the nursing bay. 
When Tina was bedridden, she received 
bouquets of flowers and get-well cards 
from many Senators and Representa-
tives. 
Former Senator Paul Simon once 
said that Tina’s story is ‘‘the story of 
America.’’ On her 90th birthday, Con-
gressman MARK DESAULNIER said that 
she is ‘‘an inspiration to the Nation.’’ 
On her 93rd birthday, Senator DURBIN 
wrote that the Senate has ‘‘deep re-
spect and admiration for her.’’ 
I am here today to remind my col-
leagues and my constituents of Tina’s 
wonderful legacy here on Capitol Hill. 
At a time of polarization, Tina’s story 
reminds us of our common bonds, both 
in Congress and in the country. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our sincere thanks to Tina for

OPPOSING ACTION IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, along with the 
American people, I oppose any reckless 
action that would lead us into another 
endless war in the Middle East. And, 
yet, we now have thousands more 
troops in the Middle East than we had 
before the President unilaterally made 
the decision to kill Soleimani. 
My prayers are with each and every 
American serving in harm’s way to 
keep us safe. 
While I do not mourn the death of 
Soleimani, a terrorist with American 
blood on his hands, the American peo-
ple deserve to know how this will make 
us safer. How will it make us safer? 
Unfortunately, the President pro-
vided little clarity in his statement, so 
we still don’t know how this action 
will affect our Nation’s security. 
I am against war with Iran. Another 
endless war in the Middle East would 
be a grave mistake.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 535, PFAS ACTION ACT 
OF 2019 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 779 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 779 
Resolved, That at any time after adoption 
of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant 
to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the 
House resolved into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 535) to require 
the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency to designate per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous sub-
stances under the Comprehensive Environ-
mental Response, Compensation, and Liabil-
ity Act of 1980. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and amendments specified in this resolution 
and shall not exceed one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. After general debate 
the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the 
amendment in the nature of a substitute rec-
ommended by the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce now printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute consisting 
of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-45, 
modified by the amendment printed in part 
A of the report of the Committee on Rules 
accompanying this resolution, shall be con-
sidered as adopted in the House and in the 
Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amend-
ed, shall be considered as the original bill for 
the purpose of further amendment under the 
five-minute rule and shall be considered as 
read. All points of order against provisions 
in the bill, as amended, are waived. No fur-
ther amendment to the bill, as amended, 
shall be in order except those printed in part 
B of the report of the Committee on Rules. 
Each such further amendment may be of-
fered only in the order printed in the report, 
may be offered only by a Member designated 
in the report, shall be considered as read, 
shall be debatable for the time specified in 
the report equally divided and controlled by 
the proponent and an opponent, shall not be 
subject to amendment, and shall not be sub-
ject to a demand for division of the question 
in the House or in the Committee of the 
Whole. All points of order against such fur-
ther amendments are waived. At the conclu-
sion of consideration of the bill for amend-
ment the Committee shall rise and report 
the bill, as amended, to the House with such 
further amendments as may have been 
adopted. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill, as amended, 
and on any further amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
on 
Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a structured rule for House 
Resolution 779, providing for consider-
ation of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act 
of 2019. 
The rule provides 1 hour of general 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce. The rule self-executes a 
manager’s amendment by Chairman 
PALLONE, makes in order 22 amend-
ments, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to start 
the new year and the new congres-
sional session with our first legislative 
action being a rule for a comprehen-
sive, bipartisan bill to address a threat 
to our constituents, both across Penn-
sylvania and across the country. 
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, 
commonly known as PFAS, have been 
manufactured and used in the United 
States for over 60 years. These chemi-
cals are found in everyday products 
like food packaging materials, cleaning 
products, nonstick cookware, stain- 
and water-resistant materials, fire-
fighting foams, and more. 
There are thousands of PFAS chemi-
cals, but two of the most common and 
most notorious are PFOA and PFOS, 
substances used to make Teflon and 
Scotchgard, respectively. 
PFAS are known as forever chemi-
cals. They do not break down, and they 
remain in the environment and other 
living organisms for decades. PFAS 
chemicals are made of one of the 
strongest carbon bonds possible. As a 
result, these substances are extremely 
persistent in the environment and are 
able to be absorbed by humans and 
wildlife. 
PFAS have long been linked with 
various forms of cancer, including kid-
ney, liver, and pancreatic cancers; 
weakened immune systems; low birth 
weight; infertility; impaired childhood 
development; and other diseases. 
Not only are these substances resil-
ient and harmful, but they are now 
found in the blood of over 99 percent of 
Americans. 
PFAS contaminate our environment 
in a variety of ways, particularly 
through landfills and wastewater run-
off sites. Once these chemicals are in-
troduced into an area, they leach into 
the soil and groundwater, becoming 
immediate threats to surrounding life. 
Analysis 
by 
the 
Environmental 
Working Group found that more than 
1,500 drinking water systems in the 
United States may be contaminated 
with PFAS, affecting up to 110 million 
Americans from drinking water alone. 
In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, 17 sites have been identified as 
containing PFAS contamination. Some 
of these sites are water utilities and ci-
vilian airports, but additional sites 
like waste incinerators were included 
as well. People living in close prox-
imity to waste incinerators already 
face a host of environmental risk fac-
tors from polluted air and water. Addi-
tional contaminants from PFAS adds 
insult to injury for these neglected and 
often economically distressed areas. 
The Department of Defense has iden-
tified over 400 military sites across the 
U.S. that use or were suspected of hav-
ing used PFAS in firefighting foam. 
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, is 
home to two of these former bases 
where firefighting foam leached into 
the groundwater after years of use. 
These bases are no longer active, but 
the effects from PFAS will be felt by 
residents for generations to come. 
My friend and colleague, Congress-
woman MADELEINE DEAN, a founding 
member of the PFAS Task Force, 
helped secure a grant to study the 
health effects of PFAS contamination 
in this area. I commend the work that 
she is doing to protect her constituents 
and to ensure that they have a water 
supply that they can rely on for gen-
erations to come. 
The fact of the matter is that the 
Federal Government has known about 
the dangers presented by PFAS for 
years. 
The 
chemical 
industry 
has 
known 
for 
even 
longer 
and, 
unsurprisingly, has fought tooth and 
nail against efforts to regulate their 
distribution and use.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H24 
January 8, 2020 
Despite this, the only action taken 
against PFAS was in 2006, when the 
EPA instituted a voluntary phaseout of 
PFOA and PFOS instead of instituting 
any stronger measures. Recently, the 
EPA has declined to promulgate stand-
ards on PFAS despite acknowledging 
the dangers they present to human and 
environmental health. 
Just as foxes shouldn’t guard the 
henhouse, 
chemical 
companies 
shouldn’t be trusted to regulate them-
selves. Research on the additional 
thousands of PFAS outside of PFOS 
and PFOA can and should continue, but 
thus far, all research has confirmed 
that PFAS are harmful. 
We would not eat food that could po-
tentially cause us harm without under-
standing the full range of ramifications 
first. Why should we put those risks on 
our children without first knowing how 
PFAS will affect them? 
H.R. 535 will provide protections to 
our communities in the immediate 
term and ensure that there are enforce-
able standards in place for the long 
term. This bill would require the EPA 
to use tools under existing environ-
mental statutes to require cleanup of 
sites contaminated with PFOA and 
PFOS, set air emission limits, prohibit 
unsafe incineration of PFAS, and limit 
the introduction of new PFAS chemi-
cals into the market. 
Further, the PFAS Action Act will 
limit human exposure to PFAS by re-
quiring a drinking water standard for 
PFAS that protects public health, par-
ticularly regarding the health of vul-
nerable groups like infants, children, 
and pregnant women. 
Finally, the bill takes the necessary 
step of designating all PFAS as haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act. 
I would like to recognize and thank 
my colleague, Congresswoman DEBBIE 
DINGELL, for her hard work and tireless 
efforts to keep Americans safe from 
PFAS, as well as Congressman FRED 
UPTON and the other members of the 
Energy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee 
whose bills were incorporated into H.R. 
535. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
rule and the underlying bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative SCANLON
for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 535, the bill before 
us today, lays out an aggressive, 
antiscience regulatory framework for 
addressing 
perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly 
known as PFAS, under several environ-
mental statutes, including the Safe 
Drinking Water Act; the Comprehen-
sive Environmental Response, Com-
pensation, and Liability Act, also 
known as CERCLA; the Clean Air Act; 
and the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
This is an unprecedented way of con-
ducting science, counteracting decades 
of U.S. environmental policy and likely 
compromising 
public 
safety, 
public 
health, environmental protection, and 
national defense efforts. 
This bill requires the Environmental 
Protection Agency, EPA, to designate 
all perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
chemical compounds as hazardous sub-
stances within 1 year of enactment of 
this bill. Since the enactment of 
CERCLA, Congress has never—let me 
repeat, never—statutorily mandated a 
substance’s designation. That designa-
tion shall be left to the regulatory 
process, allowing for notice, public 
input, and scientific review and anal-
ysis. 
Designation as a hazardous substance 
under CERCLA triggers a wide variety 
of notifications and response actions. 
For example, a release of the des-
ignated hazardous substance chemical 
may require the polluter to notify the 
entire populace in the area and/or gov-
ernment 
entities 
and 
may 
trigger 
cleanup/abatement requirements. 
Small communities are not going to 
be able to afford it. It also attaches 
strict and retroactive liability without 
a liability shield for innocent parties 
that acted according to the law. 
Not only does this bill mandate the 
designation of the entire class of PFAS 
chemicals as hazardous air pollutants 
under the Clean Air Act, but it also 
designates the entire PFAS class under 
CERCLA. That kind of designation 
under CERCLA, coupled with the other 
features of this bill, would amount to a 
de facto ban of all PFAS, including the 
many lifesaving products that incor-
porate PFAS. 
However, I don’t hear my Democratic 
colleagues 
here 
talking 
about 
the 
PFAS chemicals that are helping peo-
ple. For instance, the type of PFAS 
used in the device in this poster next to 
me is made by Gore of Gore-Tex fame. 
The device plugs a hole in a baby’s 
heart. Again, these devices help save 
the lives of babies born with holes in 
their hearts. If EPA is forced to des-
ignate the entire class of PFAS as haz-
ardous material, think about how 
many parents will have to think twice 
and may suddenly feel conflicted in 
giving their babies lifesaving surgery 
using devices like this or similar med-
ical devices. 
We cannot classify an entire class as 
hazardous when, in fact, there are only 
some bad actors. 
Gore’s medical products division is 
centered in Flagstaff, Arizona. I rep-
resent Arizona, and they have a cam-
pus in north Phoenix, which is in my 
district. This campus has about 700 em-
ployees making medical products. As a 
whole, Gore has approximately 2,300 
employees in Arizona engaged in the 
research, development, and manufac-
turing of medical devices. 
I had the opportunity to tour Gore 
and its medical products division, 
where I got to see firsthand the cre-
ative, innovative, and technology-driv-
en solutions they are cultivating to 
help cure medical conditions for Amer-
icans. These are FDA- and scientif-
ically approved medical devices, yet 
this bill threatens them and threatens 
the American people. However, H.R. 
535, as amended, mandates multiple ag-
gressive actions based on a woefully in-
complete scientific understanding of 
health effects for this diverse class of 
more than 5,000 chemical compounds. 
We know that PFAS are chemicals 
used in numerous consumer products 
and industrial processes. They are re-
sistant to heat, oils, stains, grease, and 
water. Those properties make them im-
portant to many products and proc-
esses in commerce, such as firefighting 
foam, 
cellphones, 
medical 
devices, 
Kevlar, semiconductors, solar panels, 
and chlorine, and even in our own De-
partment of Defense, including F–16s. 
I have Luke Air Force Base in my 
district. They have trained F–16 pilots 
for years. Now, they are switching over 
the F–35s, but they still train F–16s. 
This is important to our national de-
fense. 
The class of PFAS chemicals num-
bers more than 5,000. Of those, only 
about 29 have developed scientific data 
and methods. That is 29 out of 5,000. 
PFAS are a diverse family of chemi-
cals, which includes a broad range of 
substances 
with 
different 
physical, 
chemical, and toxicological properties 
and uses. Hence, the hazard and risk 
profile of various PFAS are very dif-
ferent. 
b 1230 
It is neither scientifically accurate 
nor appropriate to group all PFAS to-
gether or take a one-size-fits-all regu-
latory approach for this wide range of 
substances. 
We all want to ensure American citi-
zens are not exposed to dangerous 
chemicals. We want to do it sooner 
rather than later. However, my Repub-
lican colleagues on the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee and many 
integral 
stakeholders 
have 
grave 
doubts that the Comprehensive Envi-
ronmental 
Response 
Compensation, 
and Liability Act, commonly, known 
as CERCLA, is the magic bullet for this 
problem. In fact, it may create more 
problems than meet the eye. 
This is why numerous letters have 
been sent to Members of Congress from 
relevant stakeholders to urge Congress 
to oppose provisions that would cir-
cumvent existing, well-established reg-
ulatory processes, predetermine out-
comes using inadequate scientific data, 
and potentially inhibit effective clean-
up of those PFAS that are of the great-
est concern. 
Some of these stakeholders, such as 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Air-
lines for America, Airports Council 
International—North America, Amer-
ican 
Chemistry 
Council, 
American 
Fuel and Petrochemical Manufactur-
ers, American Petroleum Institute, Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
and more, are the folks dealing with 
the repercussions of what we do here in 
this Chamber. They are the ones rep-
resenting hundreds of thousands of jobs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H25 
January 8, 2020 
in all 50 States; yet, here we are telling 
the people who deal with these issues 
daily that, no, we don’t care what they 
think. We are going to move ahead 
with a partisan and controversial alter-
native. We will cost thousands of 
Americans their jobs in a rush process 
instead of working together to do 
something meaningful. 
The bill before us today creates an 
unrealistic condition that EPA must 
require manufacturers and processors 
to test each chemical in the entire 
PFAS class. This testing requirement 
applies to each of the 5,000 per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances, a task that 
will be enormously expensive and time 
consuming. 
I agree, we need to prevent environ-
mental contamination by these sub-
stances. That is why we have. We have 
recently made huge steps and taken big 
actions. 
Just last month, we passed the fiscal 
2020 National Defense Authorization 
Act and various spending bills, where 
several PFAS provisions were enacted 
into law. The laws we passed together 
on a bipartisan basis will start making 
a difference in communities imme-
diately. 
They required substantial reporting 
and public disclosures, created grants 
for drinking water treatment, author-
ized PFAS research and detection pro-
grams, phased out PFAS in firefighting 
foam used by the Department of De-
fense, and required cooperative cleanup 
agreements between the Department of 
Defense and States for Department of 
Defense facilities with PFAS contami-
nation. 
The bill signed into law reflected a 
bicameral compromise and omitted 
language from the House’s version, 
H.R. 2500, that would have required the 
EPA to designate PFAS as hazardous 
substances. 
We need, here, a consistent and cred-
ible 
approach 
to 
regulating 
these 
chemicals 
that 
leverages 
existing 
frameworks to access the potential 
risks associated with PFAS. Our ac-
tions should be based on existing ad-
ministrative 
procedures 
and 
sound 
science. 
However, last night, when we were 
reviewing this bill in the Rules Com-
mittee, of which I am a member, I 
heard numerous times from my Demo-
cratic colleagues that they do not trust 
the EPA, that they do not trust their 
workforce, apparently. 
This baffles me. In fiscal year 2019, 
the EPA employed 14,172 individuals. 
These thousands of individuals go to 
work each and every day to work for 
EPA’s mission. The mission of the EPA 
is to protect human health and the en-
vironment. 
EPA has developed a PFAS Action 
Plan to address PFAS issues across 
multiple environmental mediums. As 
part of the plan, the Agency, among 
other things, has issued interim rec-
ommendations for addressing ground-
water contaminated with PFOA and 
PFOS under Federal cleanup programs, 
sent to the Office of Management and 
Budget for interagency review a pro-
posed drinking water regulatory deter-
mination for PFOA and PFOS, and is 
working through the regulatory devel-
opment process for listing the PFOA 
and PFOS as ‘‘hazardous substances’’ 
under CERCLA. Clearly, action is hap-
pening. 
However, we need to be working to-
gether more. To quote the National As-
sociation of Manufacturers: ‘‘Congres-
sional action should enable and encour-
age the appropriate agencies to carry 
out the risk-based approach established 
in existing U.S. environmental law and 
policy. Congress should prioritize the 
cleanup of contaminated sites to pro-
tect communities. Congress should also 
provide oversight to ensure a coordi-
nated and timely government response 
and appropriate the funding necessary 
to support sound scientific research 
and the management, mitigation, and 
ongoing 
monitoring 
of 
specific 
PFAS’’—not all PFAS. 
However, this bill cannot pass the 
Senate and cannot become law—and 
my Democratic colleagues know that— 
while the bipartisan Senate-passed lan-
guage, as included in the Senate 
version of the NDAA, could be signed 
into law. 
The Republican-supported substitute 
amendment that was introduced in 
committee markup consisted of the 
Senate-passed language on PFAS. It 
would still require the EPA to issue 
regulations covering PFAS, require the 
EPA to issue drinking water regula-
tions covering PFAS, and require the 
EPA to use appropriate science in 
issuing these regulations. It would 
eliminate the CERCLA/Superfund pro-
visions contained in this bill because 
the Senate will not pass them. 
Why can we not pass something that 
could help improve countless lives and 
that we know that the Senate will take 
on and pass? 
We should be promoting a consistent, 
comprehensive approach for assessing 
and regulating specific PFAS that 
takes into account existing regulatory 
frameworks. If Congress acts in this 
area, it should utilize these frame-
works to ensure consistent, science- 
based regulatory approaches, trans-
parency, broad stakeholder input, and 
enforceable regulations. That is the 
way we can get something meaning-
fully passed through both Chambers 
and signed into law. 
We need to pass a bill that would en-
courage innovation and production of 
new chemicals to replace existing 
chemicals 
in 
commerce, 
not 
disincentivize it, which this bill does. 
We need to ensure our constituents 
are not exposed to dangerous chemi-
cals. 
We need to do our constitutional role 
in overseeing Federal agencies; how-
ever, we should not be doing so in a 
way that would make regulation im-
practical, eliminate the use of medical- 
saving devices, or tie the hands of the 
Department of Defense. 
So let’s work together. Let’s make 
some progress that could actually pass 
both Chambers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a December 5, 2019, 
New York Times article, entitled, 
‘‘Government Studying Widely Used 
Chemicals Linked to Health Issues.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Dec. 5, 2019] 
GOVERNMENT STUDYING WIDELY USED 
CHEMICALS LINKED TO HEALTH ISSUES 
(By Eric Lipton) 
WARMINSTER, PA.—Two decades after con-
cern emerged about a class of chemicals used 
in everything from Teflon pans to fire-
fighting foam, the federal government has 
started the first in a series of detailed stud-
ies of the impact the chemicals have had on 
human health. 
The goal is to determine what role the 
chemicals, known generally as PFAS, play in 
a long list of health conditions including 
thyroid, kidney, liver, cardiovascular and 
autoimmune diseases, among other ailments. 
The studies will involve thousands of adults 
and children in eight communities nation-
wide, and the findings will help determine 
just how extensive of a cleanup is necessary 
at sites where groundwater or drinking 
water supplies have been contaminated. 
This is hardly an academic matter in com-
munities like Warminster, a suburb of Phila-
delphia, where Hope Martindell Grosse grew 
up just across the street from the now- 
defunct Naval Air Warfare Center. The base 
is one of about 200 military installations 
around the country where groundwater has 
been contaminated by the chemicals, includ-
ing at least 24 where drinking water was af-
fected. 
Ms. Grosse and several members of her 
family have had a series of health problems, 
including autoimmune disease, cancer and 
other unusual conditions, such as a missing 
set of adult teeth in both of her daughters. 
Her childhood home was just 25 feet from 
the Navy base and for decades she and her 
family consumed water from a well in their 
front yard. Even after the house was con-
nected to a municipal water system, the 
water coming to the house was still contami-
nated because the local supplier realized 
only about three years ago that it was also 
using groundwater contaminated by PFAS. 
The utility was then forced to buy water 
from outside the area. 
Earlier tests of about 200 area residents 
have already confirmed high levels of PFAS 
in the bloodstream of people who lived near 
the former Warminster base and a second 
nearby military facility, Naval Air Station 
Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove. 
‘‘My greatest concern is what this means 
for my children,’’ Ms. Grosse said. ‘‘I know 
my kids have this chemical in them.’’ 
But what remains unclear is how strong 
the association is between PFAS exposure 
and various health ailments. 
It is a question that federal scientists and 
researchers hope to answer, at least in part, 
with this first multisite health effects study. 
It will be conducted in New Hampshire, 
Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, New Jer-
sey, Massachusetts, New York and Cali-
fornia, in communities where drinking water 
is known to have been contaminated. 
In total about 8,000 adults and 2,500 chil-
dren who lived in areas where drinking water 
was known to have been contaminated with 
PFAS will have blood and urine sampled and 
medical histories checked. The initial round 
of $7 million in grants to fund the work has 
already been distributed.

H26 
January 8, 2020 
The first study, in the Pease, N.H., area, is 
underway and enrolling participants. 
Delays in settling on and approving re-
search protocol for the work in the seven 
other locations mean that actual tests on 
participants will most likely be put off until 
at least the end of next year. But researchers 
at some of those sites have started to collect 
historical information on drinking water 
contamination. 
In most of the locations, the study will not 
specifically look for apparent correlations 
between exposure to PFAS and cancer, be-
cause the sample size is not large enough to 
produce statistically significant results, fed-
eral officials said. 
But in Pennsylvania, researchers will be 
gathering data on hundreds of thousands of 
cancer cases in the area to see if there ap-
pears to be a high incidence of certain can-
cers among those exposed to the contami-
nated water, said Resa M. Jones, a Temple 
University epidemiologist who will be over-
seeing this work. 
Public concern about the chemicals first 
emerged in the late 1990s in communities in-
cluding Parkersburg, W.Va., which was home 
to a DuPont chemical manufacturing plant 
where one form of PFAS was made, after a 
series of illnesses emerged among area resi-
dents and even farm animals. 
The discovery of this threat in West Vir-
ginia, and the struggle to get DuPont to 
cover medical costs, are the subject of a new 
movie, called ‘‘Dark Waters.’’ 
Medical studies completed around 2012 in 
Parkersburg ultimately confirmed a ‘‘prob-
able link’’ between the exposure to PFAS 
chemicals and testicular cancer, kidney can-
cer and thyroid disease, among other condi-
tions. Animal studies have also suggested 
links between exposure and health problems 
in humans, federal authorities say. 
Since then, certain versions of the chem-
ical—there are thousands of different for-
mulas—have been removed from the market, 
including two that were once widely used in 
nonstick cooking pans and stain-resistant 
clothes. But there remain concerns that 
some of the replacement chemicals may 
cause some of the same illnesses. 
The new research now getting underway— 
which was authorized by Congress through 
the Defense Department after a bipartisan 
push led by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Demo-
crat of New Hampshire—will focus on expo-
sures that are occurring outside any work-
place, due to exposure to contaminated 
drinking water. 
‘‘This is an attempt to produce some im-
portant knowledge that can be useful not 
only for a particular community but more 
generally across the United States, in a large 
population,’’ he said. 
The Environmental Protection Agency is 
separately also moving toward establishing 
federal cleanup standards for contaminated 
areas and also to decide on what the national 
safety limit for PFAS-related chemicals in 
drinking water should be, questions the 
agency has been considering for at least a 
decade. 
Robert A. Bilott, an Ohio lawyer who has 
spent two decades pursing litigation against 
PFAS manufacturers including DuPont, said 
the research was a welcome step toward de-
veloping a better understanding of the 
health consequences of PFAS. But he said he 
remained determined to push the manufac-
turers to pay for an even larger study that 
would look in a more comprehensive way for 
correlations between PFAS exposure and 
cancer. 
‘‘I am glad to see the federal government is 
stepping in and recognizing more needs to be 
done,’’ said Mr. Bilott, whose story is the 
focus of the ‘‘Dark Waters’’ film and who has 
also written a book on his two-decade legal 
fight on the issue. ‘‘But I don’t want it to be 
a shield against more comprehensive studies 
that need to be done.’’ 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, what we 
are discussing is not an abstract issue, 
as this article outlines. These forever 
chemicals are adversely impacting real 
people right now, and they can be caus-
ing families to confront health issues 
like autoimmune disease, cancer, even 
children missing their set of adult 
teeth. 
So not only do we need more re-
search, we need strong action now, and 
that is why the legislation we are con-
sidering here today is so important. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE). 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative SCANLON for granting 
me the time and Chairman PALLONE 
and particularly Congresswoman DIN-
GELL
for their leadership on PFAS 
issues. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 535, 
the PFAS Action Act of 2019. This bi-
partisan bill will take much-needed 
and long-overdue action on these harm-
ful forever chemicals. 
These 
pervasive 
and 
dangerous 
chemicals pose serious risks to both 
human health and to our environment, 
and the delay in taking action on them 
has been inexcusable. They are known 
hormone disruptors, and studies link 
the exposure to them to kidney and 
testicular cancer, to thyroid disease 
and other health problems. 
PFAS chemicals are concentrated in 
human and animal blood and tissue, 
and they can remain there for years. It 
is estimated that 99 percent of all 
Americans have PFAS in their blood. 
In my home State of Maine, PFAS 
was first discovered in the groundwater 
at a former military installation due to 
the use of fire foam containing PFAS. 
But PFAS contamination has been 
found in our public water supply, in 
soil, in agriculture, and in animal prod-
ucts. 
Once in the environment, PFAS will 
never break down. That is why they are 
called forever chemicals, so cleanup is 
essential to protect people in our envi-
ronment. 
Companies 
and 
regulators 
have 
known about the risks of products like 
Teflon, Scotchgard, and, yes, Gore-Tex 
for decades but have failed to take ac-
tion to protect or inform the American 
people. The Department of Defense has 
repeatedly refused to clean up PFAS 
contamination at military sites across 
the Nation. 
Because the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency has dragged its feet, we 
have 
no 
enforceable 
standards 
for 
PFAS levels in our drinking water, 
leaving communities without the infor-
mation or the funding to protect our 
citizens, and there has been no action 
to fund cleanup because there was no 
requirement to clean up these dan-
gerous chemicals. It is truly time to 
act. 
Some of the things that the PFAS 
Action Act will do: 
It will finally designate PFAS as a 
hazardous chemical, thereby ensuring 
PFAS contamination is cleaned up and 
polluters pay for their actions; 
It will require the EPA to develop na-
tional drinking water regulations to 
test and monitor levels of PFAS in our 
public drinking supplies; and 
It will add two types of forever 
chemicals to the EPA’s Toxic Release 
Inventory so we will finally know who 
is releasing them into our water, soil, 
and air, and we can hold them account-
able. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in taking action for the health 
of our communities and our environ-
ment and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and 
‘‘yes’’ on the final bill. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the other gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the rule, and I thank Represent-
ative SCANLON
for allowing me this 
brief time. 
PFAS 
water 
contamination 
con-
tinues to harm America’s health. The 
EPA’s website describes some of the ef-
fects: ‘‘low infant birth weights, effects 
on the immune system, cancer . . . and 
thyroid hormone disruption.’’ Our con-
stituents deserve better. Our constitu-
ents have a right to clean water. 
Finally, 
we 
are 
making 
some 
progress. Over the last year, we have 
considered and passed more PFAS leg-
islation than any previous Congress, 
and this week’s PFAS Action Act 
marks our most comprehensive step. 
We also see progress at the local 
level. In my district, contaminated sur-
face water runoff from Horsham Air 
Guard Station has polluted local wells 
and waterways for years. 
b 1245 
Last week, the Air Force released the 
funds for a $2.8 million containment 
and filtration system at the runoff site. 
I commend them for their leadership. 
Still, however, much work remains. 
PFAS contaminants exist on more 
than 400 military bases nationwide and 
threaten the health and safety of those 
who live nearby. Addressing this chal-
lenge fully requires a national solu-
tion. That means listing PFAS as a 
toxin, banning its manufacture, regu-
lating its disposal, cleaning up our 
water supplies, and providing health 
testing and treatment to everyone who 
needs it. 
I thank Representative DINGELL for 
her tenacity in drafting and passing 
this legislation. I urge my colleagues 
to support this rule. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SHIMKUS). 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, this is 
an important debate. I have been on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
a long time. I am the ranking member 
on 
the 
Environment 
and 
Climate 
Change Subcommittee which has juris-
diction on this. 
We are in this debate today because 
emotion is trumping science. We are

not willing to give the scientific com-
munity enough time to say that this 
class of chemicals is bad. We want to 
do something we have never done. We 
want to legislatively ban a chemical by 
legislative fiat, not by doing the due 
diligence of the scientific process. 
I got lectured last night. We get lec-
tured all the time about how Repub-
licans don’t believe in science on the 
climate change debate. 
Well, then the contrary is true. 
Democrats don’t believe in science to 
allow us to have an adequate debate on 
these chemicals. When we come to the 
floor, we talk about PFAS like it is one 
chemical. 
PFAS 
stands 
for 
perfluorinated or polyfluorinated com-
pounds. There are over 7,800 of these 
types of compounds. Some are long- 
chain compounds; some are small- 
chain compounds, and they are in 
every aspect of our life. 
In fact, the FDA has approved PFAS 
for food container linings. Let me get 
that right. Things that are touching 
our food, the FDA has evaluated it and 
said, this packaging material is safe. 
But no, that is not good enough for 
my colleagues, because emotion, which 
we operate on here, especially on the 
floor of the House—I taught history 
and the Constitution, and we are sup-
posed to be the emotive body. So this is 
what we do, as House Members we 
come to the floor, we cry out we are 
being harmed; government, save us, 
without doing the due diligence of 
science. 
And some of this was mentioned by 
my colleague, Mrs. LESKO, on her de-
bate. But in the F–16—here are all the 
components that are made that have 
some form of poly- or perfluorinated 
compounds in the F–16. 
She used one of our favorites; why is 
this compound good in medical de-
vices? It is great because—why is it 
good in military field jackets for our 
men and women in uniform? Because it 
repels water. That is what makes it 
great. That keeps our soldiers dry. 
I was an infantryman. I would rather 
be dry in a monsoon than wet, and that 
is what Gore-Tex or the Gore tech-
nology that uses the PFAS type of 
chemical does. 
We think there are two that we need 
to be concerned about—you have heard 
about it in the debate; we will hear 
about it more—PFOA and PFOS. But 
that doesn’t mean the other 7,798 
chemical formulations are bad. 
But what this bill that they are going 
to be bringing to the floor is saying, 
ban them all, even though the FDA 
said for food packaging it is safe. Even 
though it is a lifesaving medical device 
that is implanted in the heart of a 
child who has a hole in their heart, ban 
that. Don’t worry about it. We will fig-
ure out something else to do. 
The rule is bad because there were 
opportunities for the bill to be fixed 
and brought to the floor. One dealt 
with medical devices. A cardiothoracic 
surgeon, LARRY BUCSHON, from Indi-
ana, he offered an amendment to say, if 
you are going to have this implantable 
device, and then the device is not used 
and it is put in the landfill, please 
don’t call that a toxic chemical, be-
cause these things save lives. That 
wasn’t allowed in order. 
We are moving into an electric vehi-
cle world. Guess what all these compo-
nents of an EV vehicle are going to be? 
Components 
with 
PFAS-connected 
chemicals. 
Lithium batteries, what do you think 
they have in them? PFAS-connected. 
So we have this next chart. Auto-
motive 
parts 
containing 
fluoropolymers. Here they are. Starter 
motor, wiper motor, humidity sensor, 
engine control unit. 
I understand my colleague from 
Michigan and the firefighter foam de-
bate. But what do you think this does 
to the automobile industry, where you 
have all these components that are 
made up of some form? 
So what we have been trying to do in 
working with our colleagues is say, 
let’s find the ones we can agree upon 
and move upon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Illinois an additional 2 
minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. So let’s find the ones 
that we can agree upon and move into 
law. 
We worked diligently, and it was 
mentioned before—so the debate is also 
going to come and say, Republicans 
hate people, we hate health. Nothing is 
going to be done. We have to save the 
Republic, right? Not true. 
Even though I am an authorizer, as I 
said in the Rules Committee, we don’t 
like when other committees usurp our 
authorization, right, chairman? And we 
don’t like when appropriators do it. 
But they did it right at the end of the 
year. 
In the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, it requires EPA to mandate 
that drinking water systems monitor 
unregulated PFAS. Click that off. We 
did it. 
Provide grants to communities to ad-
dress this issue. Checkmark. We did 
that. 
Requires new reporting of PFAS 
under the Toxic Release Inventory Pro-
gram. We did that. 
Requires manufacturers and proc-
essors of PFAS to submit health and 
safety information to the EPA. An-
other checkmark. 
Guidance for appropriate destruction 
of PFAS, restriction of long chain. 
Let me say something that is really 
problematic about this bill. It bans all 
new uses of PFAS chemicals. We know 
science 
creates 
healthier 
environ-
ments. So if we are able to create a 
PFAS system that may not be a major 
concern, we can’t bring it to market 
because this bill bans it. 
Remember, we are talking about 7,800 
formulations. 
It was also mentioned by my col-
league that, in the omnibus bill, 20 mil-
lion more dollars to go to communities 
to address this problem. 
So as we go through this debate, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ They 
should have brought more amendments 
allowed to make the bill better. 
Having said that, we can go home— 
and we did—saying we have addressed 
this problem; and this bill, that takes a 
terrible provision of doing something 
we haven’t done in 40 years, ever, legis-
latively ban a chemical. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL), the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on Ways 
and Means. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say, in support of the position that was 
adopted by my friend, Mr. SHIMKUS, 
there are a lot of things that the appro-
priators do around here that I don’t 
like. 
I rise today in full support of H.R. 
535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019. This 
important piece of legislation will sig-
nificantly help communities around 
the country that have contaminated 
water supplies due to their PFAS 
chemicals. 
This bill is also an extension of the 
good work that the House accom-
plished last year with many provisions 
relating to PFAS contamination in the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
One community in my district, West-
field, Massachusetts, has been particu-
larly affected by these substances be-
cause of the past use of certain types of 
firefighting foams for the aircraft fires 
at Barnes Air National Guard base. Un-
fortunately, the situation at Westfield 
is hardly unique. For years, cities and 
towns around the Nation have been 
trying to resolve this problem with 
very little help from the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. 
Provisions in this bill, however, will 
ensure that the EPA finally does their 
part to set safe drinking water stand-
ards and to include these hazardous 
chemicals in the Superfund regula-
tions. 
Additionally, this regulation will re-
quire health testing for all PFAS sub-
stances and establish a grant program 
to help those communities affected to 
clean up their water supplies. 
Mr. Speaker, as someone who has 
worked for many years with the city of 
Westfield, and heard from my constitu-
ents aggressively on this issue, I am 
glad the House is providing some aid to 
many of these communities and ensur-
ing our drinking water is clear of these 
chemicals. 
As a member of the Congressional 
PFAS Task Force, I want to applaud 
the hard work that has gone into this 
legislation and the effort of citizens 
from areas affected by PFAS for their 
advocacy. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
consider an amendment offered by my 
colleague, 
Representative 
SHIMKUS,

that was not made in order. The alter-
native could actually pass the Senate 
and could, therefore, become law and 
help people. 
Isn’t that our goal? 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
LESKO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
amendment strikes section 2 through 
section 18 of the bill and replaces it 
with a provision mandating the clean-
up of PFOA and PFOS contamination 
at Department of Defense facilities, 
section 2, and a provision mandating 
that EPA establish national primary 
drinking water regulations for PFOA 
and PFOS within 2 years, as well as ex-
pedite the setting of such regulations 
for other PFAS chemicals, section 3. 
H.R. 535 requires aggressive regu-
latory responses to the diverse class of 
PFAS chemicals with little regard to 
science or risk assessment. This is an 
unprecedented 
way 
of 
conducting 
science, counteracting decades of U.S. 
environmental policy, and likely com-
promising public safety, public health, 
and environmental protection. 
This alternative that I am proposing 
simply takes away some of the more 
problematic provisions and gives H.R. 
535 a plausible way to passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS). 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, this is 
the only thing that can get signed into 
law. We have the Statement of Admin-
istration Policy put out last night that 
said, in this form, he would veto the 
bill. 
But more challenging is the fact that 
numerous colleagues on the other side 
of the building have said they are done. 
We worked with the four corners to 
address 
a 
compromise. 
What 
this 
amendment does is help move the ball 
forward that, unfortunately, my Demo-
crat colleagues could not say yes to 
when we had three of the four corners 
supported; House Republicans, Senate 
Democrats, Senate Republicans. 
So part of this exercise is to say, oh, 
you know, we really screwed up. Now 
we have got to show the public we are 
doing something when we rejected a 
four-corner 
compromise 
that 
could 
have been signed into law. 
So what we do is—the Lesko amend-
ment is the language, as I mentioned, 
that House Democrat and committee 
leaders rejected as part of the NDAA; 
so we are trying to then move and get 
the final portion of the most-agreed 
upon project. 
It requires drinking water standards 
for the best-known PFAS in 2 years, 
using a science and risk-based ap-
proach, and creates an expedited path-
way for PFAS in the future. 
Listen, I would rather use total 
science. I don’t want to use emotion. 
But the problem is, science takes time 
and emotion doesn’t. 
b 1300 
They have to show activity, but if 
FDA has said some of these compounds 
are safe for food packaging, how do we 
say they are all bad? Let me say that 
again. FDA has said some of these com-
pounds are safe for packaging of food. 
How do we ban 7,800 different permuta-
tions of the PFAS? 
I would not have drafted this pro-
posal this way. There are some ideas in 
it that give me pause. But overall, I 
know how to say yes to solve problems 
when they need solving. Making com-
promise means supporting things you 
may not be comfortable with in order 
to get something everyone can live 
with. Don’t make the perfect be the 
enemy of the good. Take the olive 
branch. Solve PFAS. Reject partisan-
ship over problem-solving. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
Lesko amendment. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a January 8 letter 
from over 20 environmental groups, in-
cluding Earthjustice, the Center for 
Environmental Health, the Sierra Club, 
and the Union of Concerned Scientists, 
all in favor of this legislation. 
JANUARY 8, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE SCALISE, 
Minority Whip, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY, MINOR-
ITY WHIP SCALISE AND MEMBERS OF THE U.S. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: On behalf of our 
millions of members and supporters, the un-
dersigned non-governmental organizations 
write today to urge you to vote YES on H.R. 
535, the PFAS Action Act. 
Toxic PFAS chemicals have now been con-
firmed in the water of more than 1,400 com-
munities, including nearly 300 military in-
stallations, and studies have linked PFAS to 
serious health problems, including cancer. 
H.R. 535 will build on the progress made in 
the National Defense Authorization Act for 
FY 2020 by restricting industrial releases of 
PFAS into our air and water, setting a 
drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS 
in tap water, and by kick-starting the proc-
ess of cleaning up legacy PFAS contamina-
tion by designating PFOA and PFOS as haz-
ardous substances under the federal Super-
fund law. 
The science is clear: PFAS have been 
linked to serious health problems through 
decades of animal, worker, and human stud-
ies. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to take 
steps to restrict air and water releases, re-
duce PFAS in our tap water, or clean up the 
nation’s most contaminated sites. H.R. 535 
will set clear deadlines requiring EPA to do 
just that. Designating PFOA and PFOS as 
hazardous substances, as proposed by H.R. 
535, will not ban PFAS—but will instead en-
sure that the most contaminated sites are fi-
nally cleaned up. 
We urge you to vote YES on H.R. 535, the 
PFAS Action Act.

Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this rule and the passage of 
the PFAS Action Act. 
This bill will build on the progress we 
made in the National Defense Author-
ization Act for 2020 by setting restric-
tions on PFAS contamination moving 
forward and cleaning up existing con-
taminations. 
PFAS chemicals are a class of chemi-
cals that could be cancer-causing. They 
are called forever chemicals because 
they never leave your body. They can 
be found in Teflon, Scotchgard, fire-
fighting foams, and food packaging. In-
creasingly, contamination from PFAS 
has been found in our food and our 
water supply, as well. 
As many as 100 million Americans 
could be drinking tap water contami-
nated with PFAS, according to the En-
vironmental Working Group. This is 
alarming because the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention has said 
exposure to PFAS can lower pregnancy 
rates, interfere with human body hor-
mones, increase cholesterol levels, af-
fect immune systems, and increase 
risks of cancer, while also affecting the 
learning, growth, and behavior of chil-
dren and infants. This is serious. 
This fall, I held a briefing of the Con-
gressional Food Safety Caucus, where 
leading experts presented the dangers 
of the use of PFAS in food packaging 
and how these chemical additives can 
contaminate our food. That is why I 
have called for a ban on PFAS in food 
packaging, and I am proud to have 
joined Congresswoman CHELLIE
PIN-
GREE to ask the Government Account-
ability Office to review the actions 
that are being taken at the Federal 
level to evaluate the prevalence and 
the risk of chemical food contamina-
tion. 
There is no time for delay. The PFAS 
Action Act of 2019 is a comprehensive

approach to protecting our commu-
nities from PFAS contamination. I 
commend my Democratic colleagues, 
especially Congresswoman DEBBIE DIN-
GELL and Chairman FRANK PALLONE. 
This bill will help ensure we are pro-
tecting people from these potentially 
cancer-causing forever chemicals. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I emphasize to my friends 
across the aisle that we should be 
bringing legislation to this floor that 
showcases how we can work together 
and how we can protect the public from 
scientifically proven unsafe chemicals. 
However, this package does not. 
I hope my colleagues will come to the 
table and work with the entire Cham-
ber so we can do more on this impor-
tant issue, so we can actually have a 
bill that could be signed into law, and 
so we can truly help Americans. 
If my Democratic colleagues truly 
want to save lives and protect the pub-
lic, they will stop pushing through par-
tisan bills like this one that they know 
will not be heard in the Senate and, in-
stead, actually work with Republicans 
on reasonable legislation to get some-
thing done for the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question and ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I reiterate again that 
this is, in fact, a bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, ensuring the health and 
safety of our constituents is one of the 
chief responsibilities we have as Mem-
bers of Congress. The PFAS Action Act 
will keep Americans safe by stopping 
the flow of harmful chemicals into our 
environment, our drinking water, and 
the products we use every day. 
The fight to protect our constituents 
is ongoing. Science has come a long 
way in the last 60 years, and we must 
use those developments to better in-
form and address the concerns of all 
Americans. 
One of the lessons we must take from 
having this debate today is that we are 
all better off by having a strong, re-
sponsive, and people-focused EPA. We 
need an EPA that doesn’t treat the 
American 
populace 
like 
crash-test 
dummies for the chemical industry to 
test their products on. Asking for for-
giveness instead of permission is not an 
acceptable tactic when it comes to the 
health and well-being of our constitu-
ents. 
We need an EPA that enforces envi-
ronmental protections, not one that 
lets industry off the hook whenever it 
isn’t in compliance. We need an EPA 
that 
respects 
hard, 
indisputable 
science, not one that willfully buries 
its head in the sand to avoid the inevi-
table. 
That is what our constituents want 
from us, to know that they are not 
being put at risk by the decisions we 
make. 
I am proud that this bill will pass the 
House today. The PFAS Action Act is a 
commitment to the American people 
that this majority will take a long- 
overdue step to protect their health 
and safety. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 779 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of this resolution, the amendment print-
ed in section 3 shall be in order as though 
printed as the last amendment in part B of

panying this resolution if offered by Rep-
resentative Shimkus of Illinois or a des-
ignee. That amendment shall be debatable 
for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled 
by the proponent and an opponent. 
SEC. 3. The amendment referred to in sec-
tion 2 is as follows: 
Strike section 2 and all that follows and 
insert the following:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H31 
January 8, 2020 
of Texas, for his hard work on the bills 
that we are considering. 
Mr. Speaker, in the years ahead, 5G 
will revolutionize the way we use tech-
nology. 
From 
transportation 
to 
healthcare to entertainment, the way 
people interact with wireless internet 
devices will change dramatically. As it 
does, there will be massive economic 
benefits, but only if we are able to take 
advantage of them. There will also be 
risks as people become more dependent 
on wireless communications and gen-
erate even more data about themselves 
and how they live their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, 5G will bring with it 
substantial national security, cyberse-
curity, and privacy challenges. Massive 
networks in the United States and al-
lied countries could become vulnerable 
to spying eyes and cyberattacks. That 
is why there is near universal agree-
ment on both sides of the aisle that 
American leadership will be essential 
as we transition to 5G technology, both 
to seize on the opportunities and guard 
against the risks. 
We have four bills on the floor today 
that address the future expansion of 5G 
telecommunications 
systems 
across 
the United States and around the 
world. These bills will protect Amer-
ican consumers, strengthen our na-
tional security and that of our allies, 
and help make sure the United States 
is taking all the steps necessary to 
pave the way for a 5G future that en-
hances our lives, brings us closer to-
gether, and protects against anyone 
who wants to exploit this technology 
for harm. 
The bill before us, the Promoting 
United States International Leadership 
in 5G Act, will help chart that path for-
ward. This legislation requires the de-
velopment of a strategy to promote 
American leadership at international 
standards-setting bodies for 5G. It di-
rects our agencies across the govern-
ment to assess security risks posed by 
China’s engagement in this area, and it 
increases cooperation between the U.S. 
and its allies and partners in identi-
fying and countering those risks. 
It is an important start in what will 
be a massive undertaking for our gov-
ernment and our private sector. I am 
pleased to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of my Pro-
moting United States International 
Leadership in 5G Act of 2019, which I 
am pleased to introduce with my good 
friend, Mr. CUELLAR, who is also from 
the great State of Texas. 
Texas is home to many leading tech-
nology and communication companies 
and is an innovation hub. 
Cutting-edge 
technology 
like 
5G 
holds the promise to create millions of 
jobs and add hundreds of billions of dol-
lars to the United States’ economy. 
The standards which are set at inter-
national bodies, such as the ITU and 
the 3GPP, are critical to the future of 
5G. They establish a uniform criterion 
across devices, markets, and more. 
For example, standards are the rea-
son that your USB memory stick fits 
into any USB port on any device. And 
for years, these standards were adopted 
on merit. 
However, over the last few years, 
China has been using coercive and un-
derhanded tactics at international bod-
ies to adopt Chinese technology in 5G 
standards. These efforts unfairly ben-
efit Chinese companies and empower 
the Communist Party of China. 
The 2018 report to Congress by the 
U.S.-China Economic and Security Re-
view Commission states that: ‘‘The 
Chinese Government is encouraging its 
companies to play a greater role in 
international 5G standards organiza-
tions to ensure they set global stand-
ards; such leadership may result in 
higher 
revenues 
and 
exports 
from 
internationally-accepted 
intellectual 
property and technology and more 
global influence over future wireless 
technology 
and 
standards 
develop-
ment.’’ 
My bill will ensure the U.S. main-
tains and, in some cases, increases 
leadership at the international stand-
ards-setting bodies. 
Specifically, it creates an inter-
national working group to provide as-
sistance and technical expertise to en-
hance our representation and leader-
ship at these bodies. 
Additionally, my bill will create 
strategies for increasing engagement 
with our allies, partners, and the pri-
vate sector. These strategies will help 
increase the United States’ leadership 
in the global race to develop and de-
ploy 5G and future generations of mo-
bile telecommunications systems and 
infrastructure. 
Finally, my bill will provide an as-
sessment of Chinese activities at those 
international bodies. This assessment 
will help us to ensure that the stand-
ards-setting bodies are not unduly in-
fluenced to adopt standards that un-
fairly advantage Communist Party of 
China connected and supported compa-
nies like Huawei. 
China seeks to control critical indus-
tries and infrastructure by making 
them reliant on Chinese technologies. 
These Chinese companies are beholden 
to the laws and regulations in China 
that demand cooperation with Chinese 
intelligence services. The free flow of 
information and security of a country’s 
data cannot be guaranteed using Com-
munist Party of China supplied tech-
nology. 
There are credible reports of China 
taking advantage of network equip-
ment supplied by its companies for in-
telligence advantage that date back al-
most 2 decades. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is impera-
tive that the United States leads at 
these standards-setting organizations 
so we are not beholden to Communist 
Party of China controlled technologies 
that will severely impact the freedoms 
and securities that we value here in the 
United States. 
I will say the war on 5G is on, and 
some would argue in the IC that we are 
losing that war, and we need to com-
pete with China, and we need to win. I 
think this bill will go a long way to-
wards the United States taking the 
lead and backing the Communist Chi-
nese Party from its intelligence service 
data collection. I urge support of the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
balance of my time to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), and I ask unanimous 
consent that she may control that 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Nevada? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding to me and 
for bringing this measure to the floor. 
I thank Chairman ENGEL; and I also 
thank my good friend from Texas, 
Ranking Member MICHAEL MCCAUL, for 
his leadership on this particular issue, 
and for making this bill a bipartisan 
bill, which is a very, very important 
thing to do nowadays. 
This bipartisan legislation will en-
hance the leadership of the United 
States at the international standards- 
setting bodies for 5G mobile telecom 
systems and infrastructure. 
As we all know, and as has been men-
tioned, China is the most active espio-
nage power when it comes to industrial 
espionage, theft of intellectual prop-
erty, and actions against nations and 
regimes; and we certainly see this as a 
threat. 
Once China’s 5G technology has been 
installed in a country, China owns that 
nation’s data, including the personal 
information of its people. This theft re-
sults in unacceptable national security 
risks and endangers allied information- 
sharing. 
Market analysis shows that 5G tech-
nologies will create—if we do this our-
selves here—up to 3 million new Amer-
ican jobs and add over $500 billion to 
our country’s gross domestic product. 
This bill aims to increase coopera-
tion between the United States and its 
allies, and partners, in identifying and 
countering this risk from China. 
Furthermore, this bill will increase 
America’s global leadership on 5G tech-
nology and provide an alternative to 
China’s dangerous state-run compa-
nies, which currently dominate the 5G 
market. 
I want to thank the ranking member, 
Mr. MCCAUL, and Chairman ENGEL for 
doing 
this 
bipartisan 
legislation. 
Again, we have got to make sure that 
our priorities are clear and achievable 
when it comes to facing this danger. 
I ask all Members to support this leg-
islation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H32 
January 8, 2020 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MEADOWS). 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
on this important piece of legislation 
and I rise in support of it. 
I can tell you, there are a number of 
comments that are often made about 
Texas. We see that we have got Mr. 
MCCAUL; we have got Mr. CUELLAR; we 
have got others behind me from Texas, 
and one of those sayings is that every-
thing is bigger in Texas. 
But the more appropriate line here 
is, don’t mess with Texas. And this leg-
islation is all about making sure that 
our national security is put first and 
foremost at the highest priority to 
make sure that we are competing 
internationally, right now. 
Right now, our Chinese counterparts 
at Huawei are deploying this kind of 
technology in countries that we would 
normally associate as our allies. So Mr. 
MCCAUL is right in not only leading on 
this piece of legislation, but to stress 
the importance of competing now. 
Now, in part of my district we are 
looking for 1G, not 5G. We are just hop-
ing for some kind of cellular service. 
But I can tell you, the country who 
builds it first will win on the national 
security level. They will win because 
consumers are looking for that next 
generation of technology as we become 
more dependent and reliant on our cell 
phones. 
Additionally, we have reports that 
would suggest that some of the people 
working for Huawei right now actually 
work for the Chinese Government as 
well; that it is not an independent com-
pany. In fact, not only are they work-
ing for the Chinese Government, but 
they are also working in cyber for the 
Chinese Government. And we somehow 
think that this is going to work out 
well for the United States of America? 
It is time that we act. It is time that 
we come together. I want to applaud 
the gentlewoman opposite for her will-
ingness to work, for Chairman ENGEL, 
and Mr. CUELLAR, to come together in 
a bipartisan manner. 
We need to act. Time is slipping 
away. And if we don’t act, there will be 
great repercussions, not only for con-
sumers, but for our national security 
interest. 
I proudly urge support of this bill, 
and I thank the gentleman for his lead-
ership. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Texas 
(Mr. TAYLOR). 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to rise today in support of a 
critical piece of legislation, H.R. 3763, 
the Promoting United States Inter-
national Leadership in 5G Act of 2019, 
and I want to thank my friend and col-
league from Texas’ 10th District. 
There is no doubt information and 
technology hold immense power. And it 
is amazing to be in the same building 
where the very first Morse code tele-
gram was received so long ago, right 
here in this building. 
As America builds on that legacy of 
technology, we have an opportunity to 
help lead the next global revolution, 
Industry 4.0, an era of artificial intel-
ligence, autonomous vehicles, 3D print-
ing, and cloud computing. 
I am proud to represent an area, 
North Texas, that plays an instru-
mental role in developing 5G; and it is 
imperative that we establish an envi-
ronment in which American businesses 
can thrive. 
One of the companies guiding us for-
ward in North Texas is Ericcson. Their 
North 
American 
corporate 
head-
quarters, with 3,000 employees, is in 
the Third District of Texas. Ericcson is 
investing in research and development 
and partnering with other strategic 
American players to accelerate 5G 
commercialization. 
America’s leadership begins now, and 
we can’t allow opportunities to shape 
the international conversation to pass 
us by, which is why this legislation 
here today is so important. 
H.R. 3763 will ensure America has a 
seat at the table when it comes to de-
termining the global telecom standards 
that this era will operate within. 
I am proud to represent a North 
Texas district with business taking an 
active role in 5G development. 
I want to, again, thank my colleague, 
MIKE MCCAUL. I appreciate his leader-
ship on this important issue. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3763, the Pro-
moting United States International 
Leadership in 5G Act of 2019. 
I want to thank my colleague, the 
ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, for his 
work on this piece of important legisla-
tion. 
Chinese state-run companies are in-
vesting in the fifth generation, or 5G, 
network development, and are seeking 
to dominate the global market in this 
space. This is an issue because the fu-
ture of business, government services, 
medical services, consumer services, 
and much more will rely on 5G net-
works. 
In fact, by 2035, it is expected that 
the 5G technologies will create $12.3 
trillion in sales activity and support 22 
million jobs around the globe. 
Having Chinese state-run 5G net-
works powering our lives puts America 
and our allies’ security at risk and will 
give China access to the daily data on 
people around the world. This should 
alarm all of us and cannot be accepted. 
Our daily lives rely on networks now 
more than ever, and the demands for 
advanced networks will only continue 
to increase, especially as the things 
that we use every day, even refrig-
erators, continue to be modified to 
need network connection. By full de-
velopment, 5G should be able to power 
every network need in life. 
Further, 5G, by design, is meant to 
help power business equipment, from 
things like farm equipment that do not 
need constant connections but will 
need 5G data transmitted frequently. 
This is why it is so essential and this 
piece of legislation is so important. 
I hope this is a starting point and a 
point we can jump from, not just to 
rely on 5G, but to jump forward and 
leapfrog to 10G. I applaud this legisla-
tion because it is a great start. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, for decades China 
has been infiltrating the United States, 
espionage, intellectual property theft. I 
know the issue today is Iran, but when 
I asked the Secretary of State what the 
greatest threat to the United States is 
long term? It is China. 
We have to compete with China. We 
can say they are a bad actor, but we 
have to compete. And when it comes to 
artificial 
intelligence, 
to 
quantum 
computing, and yes, to 5G, if we can’t 
compete, we lose long term, and the 
next generation is counting on us to 
win this race. 
b 1445 
Madam Speaker, if you look at the 
global map, they are moving from 4G 
to 5G in almost 50 percent of the globe 
now. What happens when the Chinese 
come into a developing nation and 
plant their cheap telecommunications 
into the ground? They suck all the 
country’s data. They steal all the data, 
and they do it because, long term, they 
want to dominate. 
We have to compete with this. We 
have to win. This is equivalent to when 
we had a space race to the Moon. This 
is equivalent to that race. It is a dig-
ital space race, a digital space race 
against the Chinese to win against es-
pionage, to win against theft of intel-
lectual property, and to win for the 
American people. 
I thank Ms. SPANBERGER for working 
with my office on this important meas-
ure. She is very involved in the 5G 
issue, and I applaud that. Being from 
the intelligence community, she knows 
how important this is. 
It is refreshing to have a bipartisan 
moment in this Chamber. I think that 
is what most Americans want us to be 
doing right now. I look forward to the 
passage of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, a generation ago, 
very few envisioned the way wireless 
technology would evolve, the way it 
would shape our lives and the world

around us. With the advent of 5G, we 
are preparing to take another massive 
leap forward, and we need to be ready 
for it. 
Even with today’s technology, we see 
risks posed by hostile governments, 
criminal networks, and those who seek 
to threaten our security, disrupt our 
commerce, and exploit our personal in-
formation. With 5G, those risks are 
even greater, and we cannot stand on 
the sidelines while China or any other 
power determines how this technology 
will be developed and managed. 
I am proud to be here today in sup-
port of the bipartisan efforts that we 
have made in this body to push up 
against the threats and the challenges 
we see. I am proud to join with my col-
league Mr. MCCAUL. I thank the gen-
tleman for his leadership on this very 
important issue. 
The bills that we are considering 
today, Mr. MCCAUL’s bill in particular, 
will help ensure that our government is 
focused on this now as this 5G tech-
nology is taking shape. I support this 
measure. I urge all of my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TITUS). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
3763, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Federal 
Government to provide assistance and 
technical expertise to enhance the rep-
resentation 
and 
leadership 
of 
the 
United States at international stand-
ards-setting bodies that set standards 
for equipment, systems, software, and 
virtually-defined networks that sup-
port 5th and future generations mobile 
telecommunications systems and infra-
structure, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H34 
January 8, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Today, we will consider four bipar-
tisan bills that were unanimously ap-
proved by the Small Business Com-
mittee last November. Two of the bills 
will provide entrepreneurship training 
to individuals in prison and post-re-
lease. The other two bills will make 
meaningful 
improvements 
to 
con-
tracting programs that support small 
businesses. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5078, 
the Prison to Proprietorship Act, as 
amended. I introduced this bill with 
my good friend and colleague, Mr. 
CHABOT, the ranking member of the 
Small Business Committee. 
I am pleased to be leading this impor-
tant effort with the ranking member. 
We have worked together over the 
years and have made great strides in 
helping America’s 30 million entre-
preneurs launch and grow their small 
businesses. 
With this bill, we will have an oppor-
tunity to make a meaningful difference 
in people’s lives. This legislation will 
require the SBA’s resource partners to 
provide entrepreneurship training to 
individuals in Federal prisons through 
intensive, in-depth classroom instruc-
tion combined with one-on-one men-
toring. 
Small Business Development Centers 
and Women’s Business Centers, which 
currently provide free or low-cost 
counseling and training services at 
nearly 1,000 locations across the coun-
try, are poised and well positioned to 
carry out these services in Federal 
prisons. 
Last fall, the Small Business Com-
mittee held a hearing to learn more 
about the role entrepreneurship can 
play in overcoming barriers to employ-
ment for the formerly incarcerated. We 
learned that despite steps to reform 
and improve our criminal justice sys-
tem, the formerly incarcerated face 
significant barriers to reentering the 
workforce. Many employers will not 
hire these individuals because of the 
stigma associated with their incarcer-
ation or because of legal restrictions in 
certain industries. 
In testimony before the House Small 
Business Committee, a witness said he 
thought that when he got out of prison 
and served his time, he would be able 
to move on and have a second chance 
in life. Sadly, that was not the case. He 
soon realized that someone with a fel-
ony conviction could be legally dis-
criminated against in housing, employ-
ment, 
public 
benefits, 
and 
voting 
rights. 
These impediments can prove dif-
ficult to overcome. Studies have shown 
that an estimated 60 percent of these 
individuals remain unemployed a year 
after release. 
Recidivism rates tend to be higher 
for those individuals who lack employ-
ment. Of the 262,000 offenders who were 
released from Federal prison between 
2002 and 2006, 50 percent of those who 
could not find a job committed a new 
crime or were sent back to prison. 
However, 93 percent of those who were 
able to secure employment were able 
to reintegrate back into society suc-
cessfully. 
Providing a pathway to entrepre-
neurship has the potential to empower 
the formerly incarcerated who are 
locked out of the labor market to start 
and grow their own businesses. Pro-
grams that focus on leadership skills, 
financial literacy, developing a busi-
ness plan, and building networks have 
the potential to reduce recidivism, pro-
vide a great return on investment by 
leading to economic expansion, and, ul-
timately, save the taxpayers millions 
of dollars. 
The legislation has the support of 10 
small business groups, including Amer-
ica’s Small Business Development Cen-
ter, the Association of Women’s Busi-
ness Centers, SCORE, Small Business 
Majority, and the National Small Busi-
ness Association, among others. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5078, the 
Prison 
to 
Proprietorship 
Act, 
as 
amended. 
Before I speak on our first bill, I 
thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for con-
tinuing our tradition in the Small 
Business Committee that we have had 
over recent years of emphasizing bipar-
tisanship. I thank her for that. It is 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
really 
working together to pass legislation 
that is beneficial to the vast majority 
of Americans, whatever their political 
inclinations may be. It is something 
that we have been working on for years 
in the committee, and I thank her for 
that. 
Once again, we have four strong bills 
here that came out of the Small Busi-
ness Committee. Our first two bills 
focus on fostering entrepreneurship 
among the soon-to-be or formerly in-
carcerated. 
Last fall, we held a hearing that fea-
tured compelling testimony about the 
power of entrepreneurship and how 
that power can help people looking to 
get their lives back on track after hav-
ing been incarcerated. These individ-
uals typically face higher rates of un-
employment than any other segment of 
our population, not surprisingly, real-
ly. Providing worthy individuals an 
outlet for their entrepreneurial spirit 
not only helps them to reacclimate to 
society but also boosts our economy, 
and it benefits many local commu-
nities all across this Nation. 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics re-
ports that almost half of all U.S. pris-
oners, unfortunately, are without ac-
cess to vocational training programs. 
Studies show that inmates who go 
through vocational training programs 
are much less likely to commit addi-
tional crimes when they get out. So it 
just makes sense for us to emphasize 
these training programs. 
This bill directs the Association of 
Women’s Business Centers and the As-
sociation of Small Business Develop-
ment Centers to coordinate reentry en-
trepreneurship services by providing 
counseling and training services that 
focus on individuals who have been in-
carcerated in Federal prison. 
This bill will create a pathway for 
qualified ex-offenders to be successful, 
contributing members of society, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank the 
gentlewoman from New York for work-
ing with us and collaborating with us 
on this important legislation. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation that can help unlock 
the power of entrepreneurship for peo-
ple who either are about to be incarcer-
ated or have been. 
It makes sense to give them a 
chance, rather than have them on a 
path where they are going to be in pris-
on, get out, and commit more crimes, 
which are going to harm society as 
well as mess up their lives severely, as 
well. 
This legislation is something that we 
have before us and can pass. It is good 
for the country, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
As the flagship agency tasked with 
supporting entrepreneurs and small 
businesses, the SBA can play a pivotal 
role 
in 
providing 
entrepreneurship 
training in Federal prisons. 
I am pleased to be sponsoring this 
legislation, which will provide mean-
ingful opportunities and hope for those 
who are committed to rebuilding their 
lives but are locked out of the labor 
market. This legislation will go a long 
way in creating more jobs on Main 
Street, with the added benefit of reduc-
ing recidivism. 
I thank Ranking Member CHABOT and 
his staff for working with me to pro-
vide a path forward for those who have 
served time and repaid their debt to so-
ciety. I would add that of the many 
pieces of legislation that we have 
marked up and the many hearings that 
we have conducted in our committee, 
this has been one of the most reward-
ing, moving experiences. We all should 
be proud of providing people with a sec-
ond chance.

PRISON TO PROPRIETORSHIP FOR 
FORMERLY INCARCERATED ACT 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5065) to amend the Small 
Business Act to provide re-entry entre-
preneurship counseling and training 
services for formerly incarcerated indi-
viduals, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5065 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prison to 
Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. RE-ENTRY ENTREPRENEURSHIP COUN-
SELING AND TRAINING FOR FOR-
MERLY 
INCARCERATED 
INDIVID-
UALS. 
The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et 
seq.) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating section 49 as section 
50; and 
(2) by inserting after section 48 the fol-
lowing new section: 
‘‘SEC. 49. RE-ENTRY ENTREPRENEURSHIP COUN-
SELING AND TRAINING FOR FOR-
MERLY 
INCARCERATED 
INDIVID-
UALS. 
‘‘(a) SERVICES
REQUIRED.—The Adminis-
trator, in coordination with the Director of 
the Bureau of Prisons, shall require the 
Service Corps of Retired Executives to pro-
vide entrepreneurship counseling and train-
ing services to individuals formerly incarcer-
ated in a Federal prison (hereinafter referred 
to as ‘covered individuals’) on a nationwide 
basis. 
‘‘(b) GOALS.—The goal of the services pro-
vided under this section is to provide covered 
individuals with the following: 
‘‘(1) Mentoring, workshops, and instruc-
tional videos designed specifically for cov-
ered individuals on how to start or expand a 
small business concern. 
‘‘(2) Tools, skills, and knowledge necessary 
to identify a business opportunity, including 
how to— 
‘‘(A) draft a skills profile, business plan, 
and transition plan; 
‘‘(B) identify sources of capital; and 
‘‘(C) connect with local resources for small 
business concerns. 
‘‘(c) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.—The serv-
ices provided under this section shall in-
clude— 
‘‘(1) regular individualized mentoring ses-
sions, to take place over the course of a year, 
to support development of the business plans 
of covered individuals and the growth of cov-
ered individuals as entrepreneurs; 
‘‘(2) assistance with identifying of local re-
sources for small business concerns for cov-
ered individuals; 
‘‘(3) assistance with identifying sources of 
capital, and when appropriate, assistance 
with preparing applications for loans and 
other funding opportunities; and 
‘‘(4) workshops on topics specifically tai-
lored to meet the needs of covered individ-
uals.

the date of the enactment of this section and 
annually thereafter, the Administrator shall 
submit to the Committee on Small Business 
of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship of the Senate a report on the per-
formance and effectiveness of the services 
provided under this section, which may be 
included as part of another report submitted 
to such committees by the Administrator, 
and which shall include— 
‘‘(1) the number of covered individuals 
mentored under this section; 
‘‘(2) the number of hours of mentorship 
provided by the Service Corps of Retired Ex-
ecutives under this section; 
‘‘(3) the demographics of covered individ-
uals who received services, including age, 
gender, race, and ethnicity; 
‘‘(4) a summary and analysis of surveys 
conducted under subsection (d); and 
‘‘(5) any additional information the Admin-
istrator may require.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5065, 
the Prison to Proprietorship for For-
merly Incarcerated Act. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the 
sponsors 
of 
this 
legislation, 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES
from New York and Mr. 
BURCHETT
from Tennessee, for their 
commitment and dedication to pro-
viding opportunities to the formerly 
incarcerated, giving them a chance to 
bring their business ideas to fruition, 
and, in turn, offering hope for a better 
life. 
After paying their debt to society, 
former inmates return to their commu-
nities with hopes and goals of starting 
fresh. Unfortunately, for numerous rea-
sons, many end up being locked out of 
the labor market. 
It is my firm belief that entrepre-
neurship is a great way to help individ-
uals overcome the barriers to reen-
tering the workforce. For the formerly 
incarcerated, it can be the difference 
between 
successfully 
reintegrating 
back into a community or returning to 
prison. 
This bill complements the Prison to 
Proprietorship Act by requiring the 
Service Corps of Retired Executives, 
SCORE, to provide entrepreneurship 
training via mentoring, workshops, and 
training videos to individuals upon 
their release from Federal prison. The 
mentorship will be invaluable in help-
ing these folks launch small busi-
nesses, and the workshops will help 
connect them with their community 
and other small business owners. 
As Ben Franklin once said: Tell me 
and I forget; teach me and I may re-
member; involve me and I will learn. 
Entrepreneurship can be one of the 
best options for gainful employment, 
and SCORE, with more than 300 chap-
ters across the country and the Na-
tion’s largest network of volunteer ex-
pert business mentors, is uniquely posi-
tioned to teach and provide this busi-
ness advice to those reentering society. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietorship 
for Formerly Incarcerated Act. 
As our committee heard in a hearing 
on this topic last fall, up to 60 percent 
of people released from prison will re-
main unemployed after a year. It is not 
surprising, then, that half of all former 
inmates recidivate. In other words, 
they commit another crime after they 
have been released within 3 years of re-
lease from prison. 
This is not good for them, and it is 
certainly not good for society. We want 
these former prisoners to be construc-
tive members of our communities. 
Small business ownership can provide 
steady employment to nonviolent indi-
viduals, which can drastically lower 
the risk of recidivism. 
This bill, H.R. 5065, the Prison to 
Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcer-
ated Act, directs the SBA Adminis-
trator to work with the Bureau of Pris-
ons to provide entrepreneurship coun-
seling and training services for those 
who have served time in Federal pris-
on. This counseling will be conducted 
by SCORE, a resource partner of the 
SBA and the Nation’s largest network 
of volunteer expert business mentors, 
with more than 10,000 volunteers in 300 
chapters. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) 
and the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES) for their bipartisan work on 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H36 
January 8, 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES), the chair of the House 
Democratic Caucus and sponsor of the 
bill. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished gentlewoman from the Seventh 
Congressional District of the great 
State of New York and the chairwoman 
of the Small Business Committee, for 
yielding and for her tremendous leader-
ship. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5065, the 
Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly 
Incarcerated Act. 
Here in America, we have a mass in-
carceration epidemic. Last Congress, 
we worked in a bipartisan fashion to 
pass the First Step Act to help propel 
formerly incarcerated individuals to-
ward success when they return home, 
to reduce recidivism, and to save tax-
payer dollars. But the First Step Act 
was just that, a first step. 
That is why, together, we introduced 
the Prison to Proprietorship for For-
merly Incarcerated Act, to address one 
of the many challenges faced by re-
turning citizens. This bill is designed 
to make sure that formerly incarcer-
ated individuals can use their God- 
given skills, talent, and ability to 
bring business and entrepreneurial ac-
tivities to life in their communities. 
Throughout our Federal Bureau of 
Prisons system, there are incarcerated 
individuals who have the same intel-
lect, the same ability, and the same re-
siliency as some of the most successful 
people on Wall Street back home in 
New York. The difference between 
them can often be as simple as a lack 
of opportunity, not a lack of entrepre-
neurial spirit. 
That is what this legislation is de-
signed to change. This bill will make 
sure that we provide opportunities to 
those who have been left behind. It is 
designed to make sure that the Amer-
ican Dream is accessible for formerly 
incarcerated individuals, their fami-
lies, and their communities. 
This effort, of course, is consistent 
with our core values here in America, 
where we believe that hard work and 
dedication should be rewarded and that 
opportunities should be available to ev-
eryone. 
H.R. 5065 directs the Service Corps of 
Retired Executives, otherwise known 
as SCORE, to provide mentoring, work-
shops, and training videos for formerly 
incarcerated individuals on how to 
launch and grow a small business. It 
would provide individualized business 
mentoring to support the development 
of business plans and entrepreneurial 
growth for recipients of prison-to-pro-
prietorship services up to a year after 
their release, connect these individuals 
with small business networks and re-
sources, and identify opportunities to 
access capital. 
Madam Speaker, I thank, again, 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking 
Member CHABOT of the Small Business 
Committee for their tremendous lead-
ership in this effort. I also thank the 
lead 
Republican, 
Representative 
BURCHETT from Tennessee, for his great 
leadership. 
A philosopher once said: Give a man 
a fish, and you feed him for a day, but 
teach him to fish, and you feed him for 
a lifetime. That is what this effort ulti-
mately is all about. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5065 and 
lift up formerly incarcerated returning 
citizens by providing them with entre-
preneurial resources. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
BURCHETT), and I thank him for his 
leadership on this legislation. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Prison to 
Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcer-
ated Act, legislation I was proud to au-
thor with Representative JEFFRIES. I 
really appreciate his kind words. 
Some individuals who have paid their 
debt to society deserve a second chance 
at success. This includes giving folks 
reentering the workforce a shot at en-
trepreneurship and small business own-
ership. Included in this legislation are 
counseling and training services for in-
carcerated individuals who want to 
start their own small businesses. 
I am a firm believer in giving folks 
an opportunity to succeed, and this bill 
makes sure those who are joining soci-
ety have the skills and knowledge to do 
so. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members who feel the same to support 
this important piece of legislation. I 
thank Representative JEFFRIES for his 
efforts on this bill, as well as Ranking 
Member 
CHABOT
and 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ. I hope I said her name cor-
rectly. I have been working on it. I 
thank them all for their leadership on 
the Small Business Committee in help-
ing this bill come to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, on a personal note, 
I 
always 
appreciate 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ reaching across the aisle to 
me and for her friendship from day one. 
I appreciate Ranking Member CHABOT’s 
mentorship and for always having time 
for a wet-behind-the-ears freshman. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
SCHNEIDER), 
a 
valued 
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 5065, the 
Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly 
Incarcerated Act, of which I am proud 
to be a cosponsor. 
Empowering the formerly incarcer-
ated with the skills to start their own 
small businesses can be a powerful ben-
efit, both for these individuals and 
their communities. By creating eco-
nomic opportunity, entrepreneurship 
also has the power to break the cycle 
of incarceration and reduce recidivism. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues HAKEEM
JEFFRIES
and TIM 
BURCHETT for introducing this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
I have long been a proponent of the 
Small 
Business 
Administration’s 
SCORE program and how it helps bur-
geoning small businesses expand and 
grow. Mentorship can play a vital role 
in the success of entrepreneurs, and 
citizens returning to society after serv-
ing time face unique challenges when 
trying to start their own small busi-
nesses. Today’s legislation would ex-
pand SCORE programming to help the 
formerly incarcerated specifically. 
I know this legislation would have a 
positive impact in my district. Our 
Small Business Development Center 
based out of the College of Lake Coun-
ty is in the process, in conjunction 
with the local county jail, of offering 
entrepreneurship training to a cohort 
of inmates. 
I am proud of the initiative of our 
SBDC and, in particular, its director, 
Mitch Bienvenue, for what he has un-
dertaken in designing and offering this 
program. I look forward to hearing 
about the success stories of these in-
mates once they return to our commu-
nities. 
I am excited to push this bill forward 
because I know that SCORE would pro-
vide these individuals with valuable 
mentorship that could be instrumental 
to their success. 
No one starts a successful business 
on their own, and SCORE can be an in-
valuable pipeline for the help necessary 
to make the dream of running one’s 
own small business a reality. 
Madam Speaker, I thank, again, my 
colleagues 
Mr. 
BURCHETT
and 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES for the work each of them has 
done on this important bill. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further Members seeking time, and 
I am prepared to close if the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) is prepared as well. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have another speaker. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN). 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
woman and ranking member, and Rep-
resentatives JEFFRIES and BURCHETT, 
for bringing this important legislation 
forward. I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietor-
ship for Formerly Incarcerated Act. 
Incarceration rates in the U.S. are 
disturbingly high, and my home State 
of Oklahoma has the highest rates of 
any in our country. According to a 
study done by the Prison Policy Initia-
tive, more than 1 in 100 Oklahoma 
adults were in jail at any given time in 
2018. The numbers are even more dis-
turbing for African Americans in Okla-
homa, with nearly 4 in 100 incarcerated 
in 2010. 
High incarceration rates have both 
economic and human costs. They are

costly to taxpayers and crippling to 
communities, which lose so many indi-
viduals to incarceration. 
While Congress has spent time focus-
ing on how people end up in prison, we 
have not committed enough time fo-
cusing on how to prevent formerly in-
carcerated individuals from returning. 
While Oklahoma and other States 
have also made positive steps in crimi-
nal justice reform to reduce the unnec-
essarily harsh prison sentences, releas-
ing individuals is only one step in de-
creasing incarceration rates. 
According to the Justice Center’s Na-
tional Reentry Resource Center, em-
ployment after an individual is re-
leased from prison is the single most 
important 
predictor 
of 
recidivism. 
Sadly, 75 percent of incarcerated indi-
viduals are still unemployed after a 
year of being released from prison, 
causing them too often to resort to 
criminal activity, leading back to pris-
on. 
H.R. 5065 addresses the critical issue 
of employment and helps break this 
devastating cycle by creating a pro-
gram where SCORE association volun-
teer business counselors can mentor 
formerly incarcerated individuals. 
The counselors provide formerly in-
carcerated individuals with entrepre-
neurial 
development 
training 
and 
workshops to help them utilize their 
skills and gain new experience to go 
into workplaces or run businesses of 
their own. 
b 1515 
Helping individuals find a job and ca-
reer opportunities after leaving prison 
is a critical step in addressing our Na-
tion’s high incarceration rate and en-
suring those who have gone to prison 
don’t return. 
I am proud to cosponsor this legisla-
tion and encourage my colleagues to 
vote for H.R. 5065. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
entrepreneurship 
has the power to equip those returning 
from incarceration with tools to over-
come barriers to employment, which 
they often face upon their release. 
Recidivism rates in America remain 
today, unfortunately, alarmingly high; 
yet, entrepreneurship can be a pathway 
to success and an antidote to recidi-
vism for the formerly incarcerated. 
This bill is designed to help individ-
uals reacclimate to society, utilizing 
their desire to start and own a small 
business. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bipartisan legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Entrepreneurship has always been a 
bedrock of American life, and it is par-
ticularly important for those who have 
to overcome employment barriers. 
Today’s legislation will provide op-
portunity and hope for those who face 
steep challenges to employment. By re-
quiring SCORE to provide mentorship 
to those who completed the Prison to 
Proprietorship program, we can ensure 
that the investment made for increas-
ing instruction will be fully utilized 
upon release for those who opt to 
launch a small business. 
With the cost to incarcerate a Fed-
eral inmate of nearly $100 a day and 
more than $36,000 a year, it makes eco-
nomic sense to invest in training and 
give these folks the tools they need to 
succeed. 
I 
thank 
both 
Representatives 
JEFFRIES and BURCHETT for leading this 
important effort, and I also thank 
Ranking Member CHABOT and his staff 
for working with us to increase oppor-
tunities and resources for those who 
seek to rebuild their lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5065. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CAPTURING ALL SMALL 
BUSINESSES ACT OF 2019 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5130) to amend the Small 
Business Act to adjust the employment 
size standard requirements for deter-
mining whether a manufacturing con-
cern is a small business concern, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5130 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Capturing 
All Small Businesses Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. EMPLOYMENT SIZE STANDARD REQUIRE-
MENTS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 3(a)(2) of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)) is 
amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ‘‘and 
subject to the requirements specified under 
subparagraph (C)’’ after ‘‘paragraph (1)’’; and 
(2) in subparagraph (C)— 
(A) by inserting ‘‘(including the Adminis-
tration when acting pursuant to subpara-
graph (A))’’ after ‘‘no Federal department or 
agency’’; and 
(B) in clause (ii)(I) by striking ‘‘12 months’’ 
and inserting ‘‘24 months’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—This Act and the 
amendments made by this Act shall take ef-
fect one year after the date of the enactment 
of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5130, the Capturing All Small 
Businesses Act of 2019, which lengthens 
the employee-based calculation for-
mula used to determine the size of a 
small business. 
Let me begin by recognizing Con-
gressman VEASEY and commending him 
for his dedication to our small business 
community. Mr. VEASEY is a valued 
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee, and I can attest to his unwav-
ering commitment to America’s 30 mil-
lion small businesses. 
H.R. 5130 is the result of those en-
deavors, and I am pleased that he 
worked 
closely 
with 
Congressman 
HERN to move this measure forward. I 
thank them both for their collabora-
tion. 
It is irrefutable that, as Federal con-
tracts become larger in size and scope, 
one or two sizable contracts can force a 
small business out of the small busi-
ness category prematurely. When this 
happens, small firms lose access to con-
tracting set-asides and must compete 
against much larger firms without hav-
ing built the capacity to do so. Many 
small businesses forced into this situa-
tion opt to restrain their growth or 
sell, rather than compete in an imbal-
anced marketplace. 
We simply cannot let this happen. 
H.R. 5130 addresses this matter by dou-
bling the employee-based calculation 
to 24 months instead of the 12-month 
standard currently being used. 
Just like the Runway Extension Act, 
a companion bill we passed last year, 
H.R. 5130 helps us keep up with the cur-
rent contracting trends by alleviating 
the effects of sudden growth caused by 
a sizable contract. 
H.R. 5130 grants small firms with ad-
ditional time to grow and mature. Fur-
thermore, it provides parity between 
the benefits extended to those subject 
to the employee and the receipt-based 
size standards. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5130, the Capturing All Small 
Businesses Act of 2019. 
Our next two bills focus on a long-
standing goal of our committee: in-
creasing small business access to the 
Federal marketplace. 
The U.S. Government is the largest 
purchaser of goods and services in the

January 8, 2020 
world. It is very important that small 
businesses have ample opportunity to 
compete for Federal contracts. 
A vibrant small business presence in 
Federal contracting increases competi-
tion, increases quality, and, most im-
portantly, lowers prices for the Amer-
ican taxpayer. All of these things are 
good. This bipartisan legislation will 
make it easier for small firms to com-
pete against larger firms. 
Madam Speaker, this bipartisan leg-
islation will increase our small busi-
nesses, and it will encourage them to 
grow successfully and competitively 
into the midsize marketplace. 
We have heard too many stories of 
small businesses successfully providing 
significant value to the Federal Gov-
ernment and growing at a steady pace 
only to hit a wall once they grow out 
of their small size threshold. We need 
to ensure that there is a pathway for 
sustained development for our Nation’s 
small manufacturers, and this bill 
takes us a step in the right direction. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN HERN), the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
VEASEY), who all worked together and 
showed great leadership on this issue 
and, again, did it in a bipartisan man-
ner. So I thank all three of them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the bill’s 
adoption, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
VEASEY), a valued member of the Small 
Business Committee and sponsor of the 
bill. 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise in support of H.R. 5130, the Cap-
turing All Small Businesses Act, bipar-
tisan legislation that I sponsored to 
protect our Nation’s small businesses 
against being prematurely forced out 
of the small business category due to 
sudden growth. 
This legislation lengthens from 12 to 
24 months the time period used by the 
SBA to determine the average number 
of employees a business has. Alongside 
revenues, the calculation of the aver-
age number of employees is one of the 
size standards used by SBA to deter-
mine if a business is still small. 
By extending SBA’s calculation pe-
riod for employee-based size standards, 
Congress recognizes that the current 
12-month timeframe can have detri-
mental effects on small businesses that 
experience temporary spikes in em-
ployment. These additional 12 months 
recognize that many factors, including 
large contracts or seasonal contracts 
and seasonal employment, can cause a 
small business to take on extra em-
ployees but only take them on tempo-
rarily while, in fact, they are still a 
small business for the majority of year. 
In my home State of Texas, which 
has a great economy, small businesses 
make up 99.8 percent of all businesses 
and employ 4.7 million Texans. 
When I am back at home, one of 
things that I do is a program called 
Marc Means Business, where I go and 
visit businesses to learn about what 
other people do in their jobs. It has 
been great for me to be able to do this. 
I have had this experience working 
alongside constituents and employers 
and employees in the area. 
Small business is really the lifeblood 
of our economy, so anything that we 
can do to help them will be a benefit 
for the entire State of Texas and the 
economy. 
I want to end my remarks by giving 
a special thanks to Congressman HERN 
from Oklahoma for being a colead of 
this legislation, and I want to give a 
special 
thanks 
to 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
for really taking small 
business seriously. As the chair of this 
committee, she came down to Dallas/ 
Fort Worth and had an opportunity to 
talk in person with small businesses 
about some of the things that they 
need. I just really want to thank her 
and Ranking Member CHABOT for tak-
ing the time to really take small busi-
nesses in this country seriously. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN 
HERN) and thank him for his leadership 
in working on this legislation. 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, it is not always that 
you work together, being from Okla-
homa, with somebody from Texas, but 
it was really great to work with some-
body on this particular bill. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5130, 
the Capturing All Small Businesses 
Act. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Representative VEASEY from Texas, on 
his leadership on this important legis-
lation which will help small business 
manufacturers gain a greater competi-
tive edge in the open marketplace. 
This bill provides parity with an-
other important small business bill 
that the committee passed which was 
signed into law nearly a year ago. The 
previous bill extended the runway for 
revenue-based small businesses, allow-
ing them to stay smaller for a longer 
period of time. 
Rapid growth in small businesses can 
sometimes push them out of a small 
business status before they are pre-
pared to tackle the challenges of a 
large corporation. While revenue-based 
and employee-based firms differ in 
many respects, one thing remains con-
stant: Competing in the open market-
place when a firm is not ready to leave 
the small business arena can have dis-
astrous effects on a small business’s 
growth trajectory. 
There is a reason why so many small 
businesses compare this transition to 
jumping off a cliff. Oftentimes, small 
firms cannot compete against the gi-
ants in their particular industries, 
eventually fail, stay small, or become 
acquired into a large company’s supply 
chain. 
None of these outcomes promote 
growth for small businesses, and none 
of these options are good for competi-
tion. Therefore, it is critical that we 
ensure our small manufacturers are ca-
pable of successfully and smoothly 
transitioning out of the small business 
space and into the open marketplace 
without falling off of this cliff. That is 
exactly what this bill does for small 
manufacturers. 
By extending the measurement of a 
small manufacturing concern’s size 
from a rolling 12-month average to a 
rolling 24-month average, we provide 
these small businesses with more time 
to build their competitive edge and in-
frastructure 
so 
they 
are 
better 
equipped to handle the more robust 
competition once they graduate out of 
the small business space. 
In short, H.R. 5130 is a good, com-
monsense policy aimed at encouraging 
small business growth and competition 
at the highest levels. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE) and thank him, also, for his 
leadership in working on this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
5130, the Capturing All Small Busi-
nesses Act of 2019. 
As a member of the Small Business 
Committee, I have personally heard 
from many business leaders who tell 
me that the guidance and the resources 
provided by SBA can be instrumental 
for success in the open marketplace. 
Often, these tools pave the way for 
rapid growth; yet, as these businesses 
experience success, hire more employ-
ees, and grow our economy, the owners 
can be hesitant to expand their oper-
ations beyond certain parameters, fear-
ing that, if they become too successful 
too quickly, the resources provided by 
the SBA would be no longer available. 
H.R. 5130 would address their con-
cerns by allowing companies to main-
tain their designated status, encour-
aging them to continue growing and 
graduate into successful businesses. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. HERN from 
Oklahoma, for this important legisla-
tion. I thank our chair, Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
and our ranking member, Mr. CHABOT, 
for their bipartisanship. This is impor-
tant legislation, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support it. 
b 1530 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, this bi-
partisan bill allows small firms to have 
the additional time, as a small busi-
ness, to solidify their competitiveness 
and infrastructure and achieve greater 
success when they eventually must 
compete against much larger compa-
nies. 
After all, about 70 percent of the jobs 
created in America are created by

small businesses, so we need to help 
them in every way we can. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank all 
of the Members who spoke here this 
afternoon on the floor for their leader-
ship in this important area. I would

partisan legislation, and I yield back

Madam 
Speaker, 
supporting 
our 
small business community and ensur-
ing that they are able to thrive is the 
top priority for me and the Small Busi-
ness Committee that I chair. 
H.R. 5130 supports the small business 
community by providing them with ad-
ditional time to grow and mature. 
By extending the lookback in the em-
ployee-based size standard, H.R. 5130 
allows small firms an opportunity to 
gradually and successfully transition 
out of the small business category. 
Most importantly, this bill ensures 
equal treatment of small business con-
cerns by granting manufacturing firms 
the same benefits provided to concerns 
subject to the receipts-based formula. 
I congratulate Mr. VEASEY and Mr. 
HERN for bringing forward a common-
sense and bipartisan solution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 5130, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

Business Act to require contracting of-
ficers to take a small business con-
cern’s past performance as part of a

ating the small business concern, and 
for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5146, the Unlocking Opportunities 
for Small Businesses Act of 2019, which 
will eliminate barriers to entry for 
small businesses seeking to perform as 
prime contractors in the Federal mar-
ketplace. 
As the largest buyer of goods and 
services in the world, the Federal Gov-
ernment needs contractors it can rely 
upon, and knowing how a business per-
formed previously is a strong predictor 
of its ability to successfully perform in 
the future. 
However, one of the challenges small 
businesses experience while offering 
their products and services to the Fed-
eral Government is showing that they 
have relevant past performance. Usu-
ally, the government relies on the past 
performance records it compiles. How-
ever, such information solely on the 
small business may not exist. Thus, 
small businesses cannot effectively 
compete for contracts. 
Moreover, small businesses cannot 
develop the appropriate past perform-
ance without winning a prime contract 
first. 
H.R. 5146 offers a solution to this di-
lemma by allowing small businesses to 
leverage other types of past perform-
ance information. Specifically, it re-
quires contracting officers to consider 
a joint venture’s past performance 
record when evaluating an offer of any 
of its members. 
Similarly, it requires the acceptance 
of past performance information gen-
erated by a contractor on its subcon-
tractor when reviewing an offer from 
the latter to serve as prime. 
With this change, H.R. 5146 provides 
small businesses additional ways of 
showing they possess relevant past-per-
formance experience. Moreover, by re-
quiring acceptance of joint venture and 
subcontracting past-performance infor-
mation, this bill advances uniformity 
government wide. 
I urge Members to support this im-
portant piece of legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5146, the Unlocking Opportunities 
for Small Businesses Act of 2019, as 
amended. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the gentleman from Minnesota 
(Mr. HAGEDORN), and the two gentle-
men from Pennsylvania, Dr. JOYCE and 
Mr. EVANS, for their leadership on this 
legislation and, again, working to-
gether in a bipartisan manner, which 
will reduce significant barriers to 
small contractors in the Federal mar-
ketplace. 
As we have heard from our col-
leagues, obtaining relevant, past-per-
formance information is critical for a 
small business to be competitive for a 
contractor award. Unfortunately, Fed-
eral agencies take a narrow view on 
what they might consider as relevant 
past performance for a prime contract 
opportunity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H40 
January 8, 2020 
This limits a small business’ ability 
to compete for contracts that they 
would otherwise be a perfect fit for, 
which is detrimental both to the small 
business and to the government. In 
short, the important thing for a Fed-
eral agency to know is whether a busi-
ness is capable of successfully com-
pleting the specific task being re-
quested. 
If the small business can show that it 
has successfully performed that type of 
work in the past, it should be able to 
use that as evidence that it can com-
plete the task in the future. It is that 
simple. 
This bill will not only unlock prime 
contracting opportunities for small 
businesses, but it will also have the ad-
ditional positive impact of eventually 
growing the industrial base, increasing 
competition, and, again, most impor-
tantly, lowering costs to the taxpayer. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
HAGEDORN), and I thank the gentleman 
for his leadership on this legislation. 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman for his words, 
and I would first like to commend 
Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking Member 
CHABOT for their leadership and their 
bipartisanship, demonstrating that a 
committee like ours can do very good 
work. I think our committee is an ex-
ample for many others here in the 
House, so I thank them for that. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5146, the Unlocking Opportunities 
for Small Businesses Act, which is very 
important legislation. It was found 
through hearings and discussions with 
small businesses who wanted to be 
prime contractors with the govern-
ment, the committee found that small 
businesses were having difficulties. Be-
cause of the criteria and so forth, the 
government wouldn’t take into consid-
eration, for instance, as Mr. CHABOT 
and the chair said, their experience as 
subcontractors. 
So we wanted to do something about 
that. And I want to thank my friend, 
Mr. EVANS of Pennsylvania, who helped 
me, and also coauthored the bill and 
collaborated with us on this bill, along 
with my friend from Pennsylvania, the 
good Dr. JOYCE. I thank the gentlemen 
for all of their work. 
It is like the title of the bill says, we 
are going to unlock opportunities for 
small 
business 
contractors 
seeking 
prime contracting with the Federal 
Government. Unfortunately, small con-
tractors are stuck in a catch-22. 
In order to receive a prime contract, 
Federal 
agencies 
require 
evidence 
showing that the contractor is capable 
of doing the work, but they will gen-
erally only accept past performance 
conducted as a Federal prime con-
tractor as proof of this experience. 
Therefore, companies can’t obtain 
prime contracts if they lack a record of 
performance, but companies can’t get 
the 
prior 
performance 
experienced 
without winning prime contracts. So it 
goes around in a circle. 
For many small businesses through-
out southern Minnesota and our Na-
tion, winning prime contracts is the 
key to sustained growth. Making the 
leap from subcontracting or teaming 
with other companies to prime con-
tracting, as we discussed, can be ex-
ceedingly challenging due to this di-
lemma. 
This assessment of a contractor’s ca-
pabilities, based only on their prior ex-
perience as a prime contractor, does a 
great disservice to many qualified com-
panies who have performed vital work 
for the government. 
The work small contractors have per-
formed in those roles may have great 
relevance to the contract as it is bid, 
however, they are unable to showcase 
their capabilities due to the agencies’ 
narrow focus on prime contracting ex-
perience. 
These limitations not only prevent 
growth for small businesses but have a 
larger impact on the Federal Govern-
ment’s industrial base. More and more, 
small businesses are taking their con-
siderable talents to the private sector 
rather than working with the Federal 
Government. 
Past performance rules, such as this 
one, are way out of step with today’s 
economy, and they undermine the Fed-
eral Government’s ability to efficiently 
seek qualified and capable businesses 
willing and able to work with the Fed-
eral Government. 
By removing this barrier to entry for 
small businesses, our bill gives them 
incentive to rejoin the Federal con-
tracting community and even per-
suades new businesses to enter the Fed-
eral marketplace. The more small busi-
nesses we can attract, the more com-
petition will increase and we will ob-
tain better results and outcomes for 
the American taxpayer. 
This bill opens up a world of prime 
contracting opportunities for small 
contractors, and I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to join me in 
supporting H.R. 5146. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
EVANS), the vice chair of the Small 
Business Committee. 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the chairperson of the 
Small 
Business 
Committee, 
Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ, for yielding. The 
gentlewoman has, in the 3 years that I 
have been here, led this committee in a 
very positive direction, and also as the 
ranking member before she became 
chair. Ranking Member CHABOT
has 
also been a partner in this effort. I 
thank him too for his leadership of 
working together. 
I thank Mr. HAGEDORN from the great 
State of Minnesota, which is one of my 
favorite 
places—Sleepy 
Eye, 
Min-
nesota—the gentleman knows that I 
know about Sleepy Eye—as well as Mr. 
JOYCE, who is a colleague from Penn-
sylvania. I thank my colleagues for 
their leadership on this bill. 
The well-being of our communities 
depend in part on what we do to create 
circumstances where small businesses 
can thrive. When small businesses 
thrive, Americans enjoy great eco-
nomic security. In my home city of 
Philadelphia, 
minorities 
constitute 
about 65 percent of the population. Yet, 
they constitute 80 percent of those in 
poverty. 
Coupled with the fact that the city 
has a poverty rate of nearly 25 percent, 
creating economic opportunity for mi-
norities is critical to advance well- 
being: financially, physically, and so-
cially. 
We, as Members of Congress, have 
tools in our toolbox to address eco-
nomic disparity. One of those is H.R. 
5146. This bill will allow small busi-
nesses to compete more fairly with 
large businesses by permitting small 
businesses to create past performance 
records. 
A past performance record is integral 
to winning federal contracts, but small 
businesses are prevented from estab-
lishing one. 
Most of the work of minority-owned 
small businesses does not count to-
wards past performance, such as work 
in joint ventures or as subcontractors 
to prime contractors. 
This hurts small businesses’ ability 
to bid, compete, and win contracts as 
primes. In turn, it impairs the busi-
ness’ ability to grow, create jobs, and 
contribute economically to the com-
munity. 
b 1545 
With the passage of this bipartisan 
bill into law, we will create cir-
cumstances where all small businesses, 
including minority-owned small busi-
nesses, will be better equipped to com-
pete and thrive. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair 
again for her leadership and the staff, 
too, for working together collectively 
to make this happen. I invite all of my 
colleagues to support passage of this 
bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE). I thank him for his leadership 
and for working so hard on this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
5130, the Capturing All Small Busi-
nesses Act. As a member of the Small 
Business Committee, I have personally 
heard how important this act is. 
Additionally, I want to speak today 
in support of H.R. 5146, the Unlocking 
Opportunities for Small Businesses 
Act, introduced by my friend and col-
league, Mr. HAGEDORN from Minnesota, 
and my fellow Pennsylvanian, Mr. 
EVANS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H41 
January 8, 2020 
Federal contracts provide many busi-
nesses across the Nation with the op-
portunity to receive stable funding 
through which they can develop a reli-
able workforce, supply chain, or line of 
production. These contracts can be a 
lifeline to small businesses looking to 
grow or expand. Unfortunately, as de-
signed, 
the 
current 
system 
limits 
smaller companies’ chances to acquire 
these contracts. 
This legislation implements a much- 
needed change to allow small busi-
nesses to use their previous experience 
to demonstrate their merits and to 
strengthen their abilities to compete 
for Federal contracts. 
This is an important step in leveling 
the playing field for small businesses 
looking to grow their footprint in the 
Federal market. I look forward to the 
positive impact that this legislation 
will have on countless small businesses 
that I represent in south central and 
southwestern Pennsylvania and across 
our great country. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank the 
gentleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
HAGEDORN) and the two gentlemen 
from Pennsylvania, Mr. EVANS and Dr. 
JOYCE, for their leadership on this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Increasing Federal contracting op-
portunities for small firms is a win-win 
situation. The taxpayers get better 
value from their tax dollars, and small 
firms grow and spur our economy for-
ward. 
This is really commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation. I urge my colleagues 
to support it, and again, I thank the 
gentlewoman from New York, the 
chairwoman of the committee, who, 
once again, has shown that she is work-
ing together in a collegial and bipar-
tisan fashion. We really do appreciate 
that. That is one of the reasons that all 
four of the bills we have taken up this 
afternoon have had both Republicans 
and Democrats working together. That 
doesn’t happen in every committee, but 
it does happen in the Small Business 
Committee, and I thank her for that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
HAGEDORN), the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. EVANS), and Dr. JOYCE 
from Pennsylvania for their work on 
H.R. 5146 to make it easier for small 
businesses to pursue Federal prime 
contract opportunities. 
In the Small Business Committee, we 
recognize the crucial role small busi-
nesses play in providing goods and 
services to the Federal Government. 
That is why we are always searching 
for ways to simplify the contracting 
process. H.R. 5146 achieves this by re-
quiring contracting officers to accept 
relevant past performance information 
obtained by a small business while per-
forming as a subcontractor or in a 
joint venture. 
With this bill, we reiterate our stead-
fast commitment to the small business 
community. Moreover, it will encour-
age small businesses with relevant past 
performance experience to bid on prime 
contracts, which, in turn, will have the 
effect of promoting the growth of the 
industrial base, enhancing competi-
tion, and decreasing costs. 
In closing, I thank Ranking Member 
CHABOT for his support for these four 
bills. When passed, they will bring the 
total number of small business bills ap-
proved by the House of Representatives 
to 27. That is not a small feat, and I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s support and 
that of the members of the committee 
who have rolled up their sleeves and 
worked together to help our Nation’s 30 
million small businesses succeed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues in the Senate to follow our lead 
and move expeditiously to approve 
these bills. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5146, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EXPRESSING 
SENSE 
OF 
THE 
HOUSE THAT STAKEHOLDERS IN 
5G 
COMMUNICATIONS 
INFRA-
STRUCTURE 
SHOULD 
CARE-
FULLY CONSIDER AND ADHERE 
TO ‘‘THE PRAGUE PROPOSALS’’ 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I move to sus-
pend the rules and agree to the resolu-
tion (H. Res. 575) expressing the sense 
of the House of Representatives that 
all stakeholders in the deployment of 
5G 
communications 
infrastructure 
should carefully consider and adhere to 
the recommendations of ‘‘The Prague 
Proposals’’, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 575 
Whereas 5G, the next generation (5th gen-
eration) in wireless technology, promises the 
next evolution of communications and infor-
mation technology services, applications, 
and capabilities across every sector of busi-
ness, government, entertainment, and com-
munications; 
Whereas the United States, Europe, China, 
and others are racing toward 5G adoption 
and upgrading existing networks, which will 
drive subsequent advances in artificial intel-
ligence, machine learning, smart homes, 
smart cities, robotics, autonomous vehicles, 
and quantum computers; 
Whereas 5G will make possible the autom-
atization of everyday activities and the use 
of the full potential of the Internet of 
Things; 
Whereas these developments, while evolu-
tionary, could include risks to important 
public interests, including privacy, data se-
curity, public safety, and national security; 
Whereas in a highly connected world, dis-
ruption of the integrity, confidentiality, or 
availability of communications or even the 
disruption of the communications service 
itself can seriously hamper everyday life, so-
cietal functions, the economy, and national 
security; 
Whereas the security of 5G networks is 
crucial for national security, economic secu-
rity, and other United States national inter-
ests and global stability; 
Whereas operators of communications in-
frastructure depend on a complex supply 
chain of technology from a global market of 
suppliers and service providers; 
Whereas government security officials and 
experts from 32 countries came together in 
Prague in May of 2019 to work out guidelines 
for the deployment and security of 5G net-
works; 
Whereas 
representatives 
agreed 
that 
‘‘[m]ajor security risks emanate from the 
cross-border complexities of an increasingly 
global supply chain which provides [informa-
tion and communications technology] equip-
ment. These risks should be considered as 
part of the risk assessment based on relevant 
information and should seek to prevent pro-
liferation of compromised devices and the 
use of malicious code and functions.’’; and 
Whereas the Prague 5G Security Con-
ference adopted security recommendations, 
which have come to be known as ‘‘The 
Prague Proposals’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES. 
The House of Representatives— 
(1) urges all stakeholders in the deploy-
ment of 5G communications infrastructure 
to carefully consider adherence to the rec-
ommendations of ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’ 
(as described in section 2) as they procure 
products and services across their supply 
chain; and 
(2) encourages the President and Federal 
agencies to promote global trade and secu-
rity policies that are consistent with ‘‘The 
Prague Proposals’’ and urge our allies to em-
brace the recommendations of ‘‘The Prague 
Proposals’’ for their 5G infrastructure. 
SEC. 2. PRAGUE PROPOSALS. 
The text of ‘‘The Prague Proposals’’ is as 
follows: 
(1) ‘‘POLICY’’.— 
(A) ‘‘Communication networks and serv-
ices should be designed with resilience and 
security in mind. They should be built and 
maintained using international, open, con-
sensus-based standards and risk-informed cy-
bersecurity best practices. Clear globally 
interoperable cyber security guidance that 
would support cyber security products and 
services in increasing resilience of all stake-
holders should be promoted.’’. 
(B) ‘‘Every country is free, in accordance 
with international law, to set its own na-
tional security and law enforcement require-
ments, which should respect privacy and ad-
here to laws protecting information from im-
proper collection and misuse.’’. 
(C) ‘‘Laws and policies governing networks 
and connectivity services should be guided 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
transparency 
and 
equitability, taking into account the global 
economy and interoperable rules, with suffi-
cient oversight and respect for the rule of 
law.’’.

January 8, 2020 
(D) ‘‘The overall risk of influence on a sup-
plier by a third country should be taken into 
account, notably in relation to its model of 
governance, 
the 
absence 
of 
cooperation 
agreements on security, or similar arrange-
ments, such as adequacy decisions, as re-
gards data protection, or whether this coun-
try is a party to multilateral, international 
or bilateral agreements on cybersecurity, 
the fight against cybercrime, or data protec-
tion.’’. 
(2) ‘‘TECHNOLOGY’’.— 
(A) ‘‘Stakeholders should regularly con-
duct vulnerability assessments and risk 
mitigation within all components and net-
work systems, prior to product release and 
during system operation, and promote a cul-
ture of find/fix/patch to mitigate identified 
vulnerabilities and rapidly deploy fixes or 
patches.’’. 
(B) ‘‘Risk assessments of supplier’s prod-
ucts should take into account all relevant 
factors, including applicable legal environ-
ment and other aspects of supplier’s eco-
system, as these factors may be relevant to 
stakeholders’ efforts to maintain the highest 
possible level of cyber security.’’. 
(C) ‘‘When building up resilience and secu-
rity, it should be taken into consideration 
that malicious cyber activities do not always 
require the exploitation of a technical vul-
nerability, e.g. in the event of insider at-
tack.’’. 
(D) ‘‘In order to increase the benefits of 
global communication, States should adopt 
policies to enable efficient and secure net-
work data flows.’’. 
(E) ‘‘Stakeholders should take into consid-
eration technological changes accompanying 
5G networks roll out, e.g. use of edge com-
puting and software defined network/net-
work function virtualization, and its impact 
on overall security of communication chan-
nels.’’. 
(F) ‘‘Customer—whether the government, 
operator, or manufacturer—must be able to 
be informed about the origin and pedigree of 
components and software that affect the se-
curity level of the product or service, accord-
ing to state of art and relevant commercial 
and technical practices, including trans-
parency of maintenance, updates, and reme-
diation of the products and services.’’. 
(3) ‘‘ECONOMY’’.— 
(A) ‘‘A diverse and vibrant communica-
tions equipment market and supply chain 
are essential for security and economic resil-
ience.’’. 
(B) ‘‘Robust investment in research and de-
velopment benefits the global economy and 
technological advancement and is a way to 
potentially increase diversity of techno-
logical solutions with positive effects on se-
curity of communication networks.’’. 
(C) ‘‘Communication networks and net-
work services should be financed openly and 
transparently using standard best practices 
in 
procurement, 
investment, 
and 
con-
tracting.’’. 
(D) ‘‘State-sponsored incentives, subsidies, 
or financing of 5G communication networks 
and service providers should respect prin-
ciples of fairness, be commercially reason-
able, conducted openly and transparently, 
based on open market competitive prin-
ciples, while taking into account trade obli-
gations.’’. 
(E) ‘‘Effective oversight on key financial 
and 
investment 
instruments 
influencing 
telecommunication network development is 
critical.’’. 
(F) ‘‘Communication networks and net-
work service providers should have trans-
parent ownership, partnerships, and cor-
porate governance structures.’’. 
(4) ‘‘SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND RESILIENCE’’.— 
(A) ‘‘All stakeholders including industry 
should work together to promote security 
and resilience of national critical infrastruc-
ture networks, systems, and connected de-
vices.’’. 
(B) ‘‘Sharing experience and best practices, 
including assistance, as appropriate, with 
mitigation, investigation, response, and re-
covery from network attacks, compromises,

vania. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
575. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H. Res. 575. This bipartisan legislation 
was introduced by Mr. FLORES and Mr. 
SOTO, both of whom are members of the 
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee, which I chair. 
The bill before us expresses the sense 
of the House of Representatives that 
all stakeholders in the deployment of 
5G 
communications 
infrastructure 
should carefully consider and adhere to 
the recommendations adopted at the 
Prague 5G Security Conference in May 
2019 known as the Prague Proposals. 
These proposals serve as a cybersecu-
rity framework for the adoption and 
deployment of 5G networks and were 
agreed upon last year in Prague at a 
meeting of over 30 Western-allied na-
tions, as well as technical experts and 
equipment manufacturers. This frame-
work acknowledges the risks posed by 
untrusted 5G network equipment of-
fered by Chinese telecom providers 
such as Huawei. 
The Prague Proposals form the basis 
for a coordinated approach to shared 
security as we begin to transition to 
the next generation of wireless net-
work technologies. 
The Communications and Technology 
Subcommittee has done extensive work 
this Congress on security implications 
of 5G technologies. I thank Mr. FLORES 
and Mr. SOTO for the good work they 
have done in bringing this important 
legislation to the floor. I also thank 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
Chairman ENGEL for working with the 
Energy and Commerce Committee to 
advance this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. I 
urge my colleagues to support it, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H43 
January 8, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H. Res. 575, a resolution to en-
courage all stakeholders involved in 
the deployment of 5G communications 
technology to adhere to the Prague 
Proposals. 
The Prague Proposals resulted from 
the Prague 5G Security Conference ear-
lier last year, where representatives 
from 32 countries met to discuss con-
cerns about equipment supplied by cer-
tain vendors that pose a threat to na-
tional security. With 5G poised to sup-
port an array of critical functions and 
services over the next decade, it is im-
perative that we ensure the equipment 
used to build these networks is secure. 
By encouraging all stakeholders at 
home and abroad to abide by these 
principles, we are sending a strong 
message that we are taking the secu-
rity of our networks seriously. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO), who is a valuable member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and who has done extensive 
work on this legislation. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman DOYLE and Ranking Member 
LATTA, as well as Representative FLO-
RES, for all of their work and the work 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
It is essential that the United States 
be at the forefront of the deployment 
and development of 5G technologies. 5G 
is the infrastructure that will allow 
our country to be the leader in the 21st 
century economy. 
There is fundamental importance of 
internet connectivity across the coun-
try for both metropolitan and rural 
areas, highlighting both cities and 
rural areas, and this is a need that 
telecom technology must be developed 
in a practical but secure way. In a dis-
trict like mine, we have urban, subur-
ban, and rural, so we look out for all of 
these different areas. 
The equipment and services in U.S. 
communications networks provide crit-
ical infrastructure for 5G deployment, 
making them appealing targets for for-
eign adversaries. For these companies 
in particular, experts have noted that 
China has ‘‘the means, opportunity, 
and motive to use telecommunications 
companies for malicious purposes.’’ 
We have seen this problem in Chinese 
telecom chips made by companies like 
Huawei and other supply chain secu-
rity issues that have been making news 
as of late. 
We started local efforts in Florida’s 
Ninth Congressional District, along 
with the University of Central Florida 
and others, to produce components 
that are tamper-resistant sensors de-
veloped at national foundries, like the 
BRIDG facility in central Florida. But 
we must do more. 
For these reasons, I am proud to be 
the Democratic colead on H. Res. 575. 
This resolution provides a sense of the 
House of Representatives that devel-
opers of 5G technologies abide by wire-
less 
technology 
recommendations 
made at the Prague 5G Security Con-
ference. 
Some of these Prague Proposals in-
clude communications networks and 
services be designed with resilience and 
security in mind, and every country is 
free, in accordance with international 
law, to have security requirements. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield the gen-
tleman from Florida an additional 2 
minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Policies governing 5G de-
ployment should be guided by prin-
ciples of transparency and equitability. 
Stakeholders should conduct regular 
vulnerability 
assessments 
and 
risk 
mitigation of products. And customers 
must be able to be informed about the 
origin of components in software that 
affect the security level of the products 
they use. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
DOYLE, Mr. FLORES, Mr. LATTA, and 
others for their great work, and I urge 
everyone to support H. Res. 575. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FLORES), and I applaud him on his 
hard work on this legislation. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank GOP leader LATTA for yielding 
me time to support our bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
our resolution, H. Res. 575, which I in-
troduced with my colleague DARREN 
SOTO from Florida, expressing strong 
support for the Prague Proposals, a set 
of 5G security recommendations agreed 
to by officials from the U.S. and 31 
other countries during a conference in 
May 2019. 
5G communication networks have 
the potential to transform the way we 
live. Collaboration with our inter-
national partners is paramount in the 
development of secure network archi-
tecture for the interconnected world of 
the future. 
5G networks will have the capacity 
to 
support 
innovative 
technologies 
such as telemedicine, remote surgery, 
interconnected devices on the Internet 
of Things, and, importantly, bring 
high-speed 
broadband 
to 
the 
far 
reaches of rural communities to close 
the digital divide. 
But if the underlying network that 
these services operate on is not prop-
erly secured, bad actors will be able to 
exploit vulnerabilities to disrupt crit-
ical 
infrastructure, 
harming 
public 
safety and jeopardizing national secu-
rity. It is imperative that we secure 
our networks on the front end of de-
ployment to avoid potentially cata-
strophic consequences down the road. 
Recognizing these risks, the U.S. and 
those 31 other countries came together 
with representatives from the EU and 
NATO to agree on a set of common-
sense principles necessary to maintain 
a secure, resilient network for next- 
generation communication. 
These proposals urge 5G stakeholders 
across the global supply technology 
chain to institute practical, proven so-
lutions to mitigate risks and to protect 
against security threats. Among these 
proposals, the conference of 32 coun-
tries recognized the need for informa-
tion sharing and encouraged regular 
risk assessment tests to mitigate vul-
nerabilities, while taking into consid-
eration technological changes that will 
address the risks we may encounter in 
the future. 
Our resolution expresses the House of 
Representatives’ support for these rec-
ommendations as an encouragement 
for stakeholders, government entities, 
and our international partners to work 
together to secure our 5G networks. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. SOTO 
for his work, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this important resolution. 
b 1600 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, from the comments 
that we have heard on the floor today, 
it is so important that we pass this 
piece of legislation. It is a good piece of 
bipartisan legislation, and I urge its 
support from this House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, in closing, I 
echo what my good friend, Mr. LATTA, 
says. This is a good bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MICHAEL F. DOYLE) that the House sus-
pend the rules and agree to the resolu-
tion, H. Res. 575, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘Resolution ex-
pressing the sense of the House of Rep-
resentatives that all stakeholders in 
the deployment of 5G communications 
infrastructure should carefully con-
sider adherence to the recommenda-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2881. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2881, the Secure 5G and Beyond 
Act, which directs the President to de-
velop the Secure Next Generation Mo-
bile Communications Strategy in con-
sultation with heads of the FCC, NTIA, 
and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, as well as the DNI and the Sec-
retary of Defense. The bill then re-
quires the development of a strategy 
implementation plan to be carried out 
by NTIA. 
This bipartisan legislation was intro-
duced by Ms. SPANBERGER
and five 
other House Members, including Mrs. 
BROOKS
of 
Indiana 
and 
Mr. 
O’HALLERAN, both members of the 
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee, which I chair. 
The Secure Next Generation Mobile 
Communications Strategy is intended 
to: 
First, ensure the security of 5G and 
future generations of mobile tele-
communications systems and infra-
structure in the United States; 
Second, assist our mutual defense 
treaty allies and strategic partners in 
maximizing the security of 5G net-
works and infrastructure and future 
generations of mobile telecommuni-
cations systems in their countries; and 
Finally, protect the competitiveness 
of U.S. companies, the privacy of 
American consumers, and the integrity 
of standards-setting bodies against po-
litical influence. 
As our Nation works to deploy 5G 
wireless technologies and develop next 
generation communications networks, 
we need a national strategy that brings 
together an all-of-the-above govern-
ment approach to ensuring this critical 
infrastructure. We also need to work 
with our strategic allies and inter-
national partners to ensure the secu-
rity of their communications networks 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, this is an important 
piece of legislation. I applaud Ms. 
SPANBERGER for introducing it. I urge 
all my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2881, the Secure 5G and Be-
yond Act of 2020. 
In today’s digital age, we rely on our 
communications networks for every-
thing from grocery shopping to apply-
ing for jobs. In the past decade, we 
have upgraded from 2G to 4G and are 
now in the process of entering the fifth 
generation of communications net-
works to accommodate Americans’ de-
mand for access. 
Making a simple transaction online 
is second nature for many Americans, 
and we expect the network on which 
the information is transmitted to be 
secure. The legislation before us is a 
step forward in enhancing network se-
curity. 
It requires the President, in con-
sultation 
with 
appropriate 
Federal 
agencies, to develop a strategy to en-
sure the security of 5G and future gen-
erations of telecommunications sys-
tems and infrastructure. 
The administration must also iden-
tify potential security threats or vul-
nerabilities and promote responsible 
international development in deploy-
ment of networks. 
Lastly, the bill requires a strategy 
implementation plan and charges the 
National Telecommunications and In-
formation Administration to carry it 
out. 
It is essential that the administra-
tion continues to take steps to secure 
our networks, and this bill provides di-
rection to do just that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this piece of legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN), a valuable member 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman, the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL
F. 
DOYLE), and Mr. LATTA for the oppor-
tunity. I also thank Congresswoman 
SPANBERGER for her great work on this 
and the introduction of the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Secure 5G and Beyond Act. 
This spring, I joined a bipartisan 
group of lawmakers to cosponsor this 
important legislation to protect next 
generation 
telecommunications 
sys-
tems and mobile infrastructure in the 
United States. 
According to a 2018 NATO report, 
Huawei, a Chinese multinational tech-
nology company and supplier of 5G 
technology, 
could 
be 
exploited 
by 
China to engage in espionage, monitor 
foreign corporations and governments, 
and support Chinese military oper-
ations. In fact, earlier this year, former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
General Joseph Dunford, called the po-
tential risks of a Chinese-built 5G net-
work a ‘‘critical national security 
issue’’ for the United States. 
To combat these potential threats, 
our bill requires the administration to 
develop an unclassified national strat-
egy to protect U.S. consumers and as-
sist allies to maximize the security of 
their 5G telecommunications systems. 
The next generation of telecommuni-
cations systems is going to revolu-
tionize our economy, and it is impor-
tant that every corner of our country 
has access to the latest technology, es-
pecially the area I represent, rural Ari-
zona, and the rest of rural America. 
With the rapid expansion of new tech-
nology infrastructure, it is critical 
that these systems are secure and the 
privacy of all Americans is protected. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of H.R. 2881. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CURTIS). 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2881, which is 
critical to protecting the security of 
our Nation and for the advancement of 
5G. 
H.R. 2881, or the Secure 5G and Be-
yond Act, tasks the Federal Govern-
ment with developing strategies to pro-
tect against some of the vulnerabilities 
with cutting-edge five generation, or 
5G, wireless communications systems. 
The rapid development of 5G cellular 
technologies is another example of the 
resolve and innovative spirit unique to 
the United States economy. 
Madam Speaker, 5G will pave the 
way for first-of-their-kind products and 
services and will more reliably give 
consumers quick and easy access to in-
formation necessary to live and work 
in the digital age; but the potential 
threats these advancements pose to our 
national security, to that of our allies, 
and to consumer privacy cannot be 
overstated, which is why I am urging 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote 
for this important legislation. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Virginia 
(Ms. SPANBERGER).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H46 
January 8, 2020 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
2881, the Secure 5G and Beyond Act. 
First, I thank my fellow members of 
the House Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs for approving this legislation, and 
I thank the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee for passing my bill 
out of committee on a strongly bipar-
tisan basis last year as well. 
I also thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentative 
BROOKS, 
Representative 
O’HALLERAN, Representative ROONEY, 
Representative 
SLOTKIN, 
and 
Rep-
resentative STEFANIK, for joining my 
effort to protect the next generation of 
U.S. telecommunications systems. I am 
proud to have such a strong bipartisan 
coalition backing my bill. 
I also thank my colleagues in the 
Senate, Senator CORNYN and his bipar-
tisan colleagues, for their work in 
prioritizing this very important issue. 
When you turn on the TV, you might 
hear a lot of commercials advertising 
5G and the expansion of U.S. 5G net-
works. It is true: This technology holds 
incredible potential for future eco-
nomic growth here in the United 
States, particularly in our rural com-
munities, as they rely on these high- 
speed technologies to connect to the 
rest of the world. 
However, the adoption of certain 5G 
wireless technologies present many se-
rious national security challenges for 
our country and the American people. 
Chinese 
companies 
like 
ZTE 
and 
Huawei continue to grow their global 
5G footprint around the world, and as 
their equipment becomes more inte-
grated into the economies of the 
United States and our allies, China’s 
leverage grows, as does the threat of 
Chinese exploitation. 
It is difficult to overstate the long- 
term effects of the global transition to 
5G. An article in The Atlantic earlier 
this week said: ‘‘The rollout of speedy, 
new cellular networks is a geopolitical 
turning point.’’ And China is working 
hard to take advantage of this rare mo-
ment. 
Unfortunately, 
China’s 
long-term 
strategy and ambitions extend far be-
yond global commerce and communica-
tions. For example, a 2018 NATO report 
warned that Huawei’s close ties to the 
Chinese Government could lead to 
Huawei’s 5G technology being used to 
spy on adversaries, monitor foreign 
companies and governments, and sup-
port Chinese military operations, all of 
which could be targeted at the United 
States and the American people. 
The adoption of Chinese 5G could in-
vite a deluge of foreign influence, espi-
onage, and interference into U.S. mo-
bile networks and wireless systems. 
But, simultaneously, China’s innova-
tion edge is also growing through com-
panies like Huawei and ZTE. As of Feb-
ruary 2019, Chinese tech companies 
owned 36 percent of all key 5G patents, 
while U.S.-based companies only owned 
14 percent. 
This makes clear to me that the 
United States needs a comprehensive 
strategy, a strategy to respond to this 
growing level of economic competition 
and to protect against the security 
risks posed by ZTE, Huawei, and other 
5G-focused companies. 
From afar, we have seen how China 
disregards the privacy of its own peo-
ple, and we should be very wary of Chi-
na’s growing 5G influence in the West. 
We need a game plan to defend our mo-
bile networks. 
The United States, the country re-
sponsible for so many of the remark-
able developments of the digital age, 
needs to strengthen our resilience 
against potential cyber threats di-
rected against American families, com-
panies, and consumer data. That is why 
I am proud to lead the Secure 5G and 
Beyond Act. 
Madam Speaker, my bill would re-
quire the administration to develop a 
public strategy to protect U.S. con-
sumers, companies, and Federal agen-
cies against potential threats posed by 
emerging 5G technologies. By devel-
oping a national interagency strategy, 
we can better identify where security 
gaps currently exist—and we can work 
to close them. 
Additionally, my bill would help spur 
new 5G research and development here 
at home, something that is critical for 
central Virginia and the rest of the 
United States. 
In the face of potential Chinese domi-
nance in the 5G space, the Secure 5G 
and Beyond Act would put our country 
and its companies on a path toward 
achieving and maintaining greater se-
curity and a competitive edge. 
b 1615 
But in our interconnected world, we 
cannot do it alone. This bipartisan leg-
islation would also encourage our allies 
to pursue similar strategies. 
As we look ahead to future genera-
tions of wireless technology, we need 
to deploy a strong, evidence-based ap-
proach toward improving our cyber de-
fenses. 
Last year, then-Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph 
Dunford called the rise of Chinese 5G 
networks a critical national security 
issue. This bill recognizes that fact and 
does something about it. 
We can continue to achieve faster 
internet speeds and wider connectivity 
across America, but this bill makes 
sure that these exciting achievements 
are accompanied by a smart strategy, 
one that can successfully prevent for-
eign influence in our 5G networks and 
keep our citizens safe. 
Today, I call on my colleagues to 
pass the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 
2020. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Again, I thank my colleague, the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MI-
CHAEL F. DOYLE), the chairman of the 
subcommittee, for making sure this 
bill came to the floor today, because 
we have to win this race for 5G as a Na-
tion, because we have to make sure 
that it helps every segment of our soci-
ety. 
The legislation is going to help us de-
velop a strategy to ensure the security 
of 5G and future generations of tele-
communication 
systems 
and 
infra-
structure. And we also must identify 
potential security threats for vulnera-
bilities and promote responsible inter-
national development and deployment 
of networks. So I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
I want to recognize the good work 
the gentlewoman from Virginia has 
done on this bill. A former CIA agent, 
and someone that knows a lot of these 
issues inside and out, she has worked 
very hard, and brought us a very good 
piece of legislation. 
It is a good bill. I urge all my col-
leagues to support it, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MICHAEL F. DOYLE) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
2881, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand 
the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4500, the Promoting United States 
Wireless Leadership Act of 2019. This 
bipartisan legislation was introduced 
by Mr. WALBERG, Mrs. DINGELL, and 
Mrs. BROOKS. 
The Promoting United States Wire-
less Leadership Act of 2019 directs the 
National Telecommunications and In-
formation Administration to encourage 
participation by American companies 
and other stakeholders in standards- 
setting bodies, such as the 3GPP and 
the IEEE, and to offer technical assist-
ance to those stakeholders that elect 
to participate in the course of devel-
oping standards for 5G networks and 
future generations of communications 
networks. 
Other governments around the world 
are engaging in the standards-setting 
process for 5G and other advanced tele-
communications technologies. Coun-
tries such as China and Russia are 
doing so directly and through compa-
nies that are closely allied with their 
governments. 
This engagement is, at least in part, 
intended to skew the standards for 
these next-generation technologies to 
favor their national interests and their 
companies. 
This legislation will give the stake-
holders the ability to better engage in 
policy choices that are being made 
today by these standard-setting bodies, 
and which will have far-reaching impli-
cations for the development of 5G and 
other advanced communications tech-
nologies in the future. 
We want to ensure that the United 
States continues to lead the world in 
advanced communications technologies 
and deployments and ensuring that 
these standards meet the needs of the 
United States and our partners. This is 
critical to that end. 
I want to thank Mr. WALBERG. I want 
to 
thank 
Mrs. 
DINGELL
and 
Mrs. 
BROOKS for the good work they have 
done in bringing this important legisla-
tion to the floor. 
I would also like to thank the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and Chair-
man ENGEL for working with the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee to ad-
vance this legislation. 
This is a good bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H48 
January 8, 2020 
Our communications networks are 
critically important assets for facili-
tating domestic and international com-
merce. 
For decades, the U.S. has led the de-
velopment of wireless technology with 
like-minded nations. With the deploy-
ment of the next-generation wireless 
technology, 5G, expected to skyrocket 
in 2020, we must continue to focus on 
bolstering foundational elements to 
make sure the United States continues 
to lead on future advancements. 
As these standards are set in global, 
industry-led standards bodies, we must 
enhance participation by U.S. compa-
nies and remain vigilant that bad ac-
tors don’t game the system for their 
own economic and national security in-
terests. To keep accountability and en-
sure proper transparency, we must en-
courage participation by trusted par-
ties. 
The 
National 
Telecommunications 
and Information Administration plays 
a central role in these efforts as the ex-
ecutive branch agency with technical 
experience. They have decades of ex-
pertise working with industry and 
other stakeholders to develop these 
technical standards globally. I would 
like to thank the dedicated career staff 
who work tirelessly to advance U.S. 
global wireless leadership. 
As we move into the next decade, it 
is vital that we continue to enhance 
participation in critical standards-set-
ting bodies and preserve U.S. wireless 
leadership. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for all of his lead-
ership. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
4500, 
the 
Promoting 
U.S. 
Wireless 
Leadership Act of 2019, which we are 
considering now. 
This bill, on which my colleague and 
good 
friend 
from 
Michigan, 
Mr. 
WALBERG, has taken the lead, and my 
good friend from Indiana, Mrs. BROOKS, 
the three of us have worked closely and 
in a bipartisan fashion to direct the 
NTIA to encourage participation by 
trusted American companies and other 
stakeholders in international stand-
ards-setting 
bodies. 
This 
is 
about 
American competitiveness. 
In short, it helps ensure that Amer-
ica’s interests are protected, and that 
companies have a seat at the table, as 
the world is deciding what 5G is going 
to look like. The policy choices that 
are being made right now will have 
lasting implications for 5G technology 
development around the world. It is 
imperative that the United States have 
a strong voice in these decisions, so we 
can continue to lead in an increasingly 
competitive market. We cannot give up 
a competitive edge or give it to an-
other country. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee advanced this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to support it today. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. BROOKS) and I thank her 
very much for her work on this legisla-
tion. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to express my 
strong support for the legislation we 
have been talking about today, not 
only H.R. 2881, the Secure 5G and Be-
yond Act of 2020, but now, H.R. 4500, 
Promoting 
United 
States 
Wireless 
Leadership Act of 2019. 
I want to commend my colleagues, 
the chair of the subcommittee, Chair-
man DOYLE, Ranking Member LATTA, 
as well as my colleagues that I have 
been 
working 
with, 
Representative 
SPANBERGER from Virginia, and Rep-
resentatives DINGELL
and WALBERG 
from Michigan. We have come together 
because we know that these two bipar-
tisan bills are critically important to 
secure our communications networks 
and protect our next-generation tele-
communications systems and the mo-
bile infrastructure in the U.S. from 
dangerous foreign actors. 
As the cofounder and the co-chair 
with my colleague from Michigan of 
the 5G Caucus, we understand how im-
portant it is that our laws protect 5G 
innovation; but also how critically im-
portant it is to keep our citizens and 
country safe. 
I also represent a portion of Indian-
apolis, Indiana, an original test site for 
5G. Our city has seen the benefits of 5G 
firsthand and we are continuing to see 
those benefits grow as we progress. In-
dianapolis was the first city in the 
country where both Verizon and AT&T 
tested, developed, and have deployed 
5G technology. 
Purdue 
University 
has 
partnered 
with these companies to create a 5G ac-
celeration zone that will serve as an in-
cubator for research and development 
in exciting new technologies for 5G. 
And that is why the Secure 5G and Be-
yond Act of 2019 is so important, to 
protect the country from potential 
cyber threats, while ensuring innova-
tion continues to move forward. 
But we need the administration to 
develop a national strategy to maxi-
mize the security of those 5G systems. 
With the Promoting United States 
Wireless Leadership Act of 2019, it will 
make sure that we are at the forefront; 
that the U.S. remains at the forefront 
in the conversation by bringing appro-
priate industry and government ex-
perts to the standards-body table. 
As our world becomes even more 
interconnected 
through 
new 
tech-
nologies and innovations than it al-
ready is today, it is important that we 
ensure our national security and our 
global competitiveness within these in-
dustries. 
So I am proud to be an original co-
sponsor of both of these bills. I urge 
our body to support securing the inno-
vation of 5G while protecting the com-
petitiveness of U.S. companies and the 
privacy of U.S. citizens. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), and I thank 
him also for his hard work on this leg-
islation. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member and the 
chairman for moving this bill forward. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4500, 
the Promoting United States Wireless 
Leadership Act of 2019. 
I am pleased my colleague from 
Michigan, 
Representative 
DINGELL, 
worked with me on this important leg-
islation to enhance United States lead-
ership in the development of wireless 
standards. 
Michigan’s economy has become re-
surgent, in no small part, thanks to the 
renewed 
focus 
under 
past-Governor 
Snyder on STEM education and tech-
nical careers in the IT field. 
As co-chair of the 5G Caucus, I under-
stand the importance of bringing not 
only these technical jobs to Michigan, 
but also the jobs that will come as a re-
sult of leading the world on 5G deploy-
ment. As industry continues to send 
their best and brightest to these global 
technical standards-setting bodies, we 
must continue supporting them with 
necessary technical expertise and con-
tinue leading the world in wireless in-
novation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4500, the Promoting United States 
Wireless Leadership Act of 2019. 
Make no mistake; the United States 
is in a race to modernize and build out 
the next generation of wireless infra-
structure. As with countless other in-
dustries, we have seen how American 
leadership can benefit not only Ameri-
cans, but consumers around the globe. 
This bill, sponsored by my good 
friend and colleague, Mr. WALBERG of 
Michigan, would ensure Federal and 
private coordination and cooperation 
when it comes to American participa-
tion in standards-setting bodies. 
b 1630 
We all know by now the potential 
concerns associated with technology 
that we can’t fully trust. By ensuring 
that we have representation on essen-
tial standards-making bodies, such as 
the 
International 
Organization 
for 
Standardization, we will have a seat at 
the table to help guide these policies in 
a helpful and secure direction. 
As many of my colleagues in this 
body would agree, a forward-leaning ef-
fort in this space will have positive ef-
fects long down the line.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H49 
January 8, 2020 
I thank my colleagues on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee for their 
work on this, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the underlying leg-
islation. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4500, the 
Promoting 
United 
States 
Wireless 
Leadership Act. 
American companies have time and 
again proven themselves as global lead-
ers in developing and deploying new 
technology. To ensure we maintain our 
competitive edge and advance future 
wireless capabilities, the government 
must work with the private sector to 
position the U.S. as a global leader in 
the development of 5G standards. 
H.R. 4500 fosters this relationship by 
encouraging 
companies 
and 
other 
stakeholders to participate in inter-
national standards-setting bodies while 
also offering technical assistance to 
participants. 
With China seeking to erode our 
technical advantage at every turn, it is 
more important than ever to promote 
American leadership and innovation in 
our telecommunications networks. 
I thank Mr. WALBERG, Mrs. DINGELL, 
and Mrs. BROOKS for sponsoring this 
important legislation. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
It is absolutely important that the 
United States develop these standards 
so that we can stay at the top of 5G de-
ployment. As I mentioned in the ear-
lier bill, we want to make sure that 5G 
is out there to support everyone across 
the United States. Because of that, we 
have to make sure that we have these 
standards in place. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MICHAEL F. DOYLE) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
4500, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SHOOTING 
(Mrs. KIRKPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, this is a very emotional day for me. 
This is the day, 9 years ago, that Gabby 
Giffords was shot and wounded in Tuc-
son, and Federal Judge John Roll was 
killed. 
Gabby had been my mentor in the 
State legislature. She was somebody I 
looked up to and admired. She had 
gone to Scripps College, and I was so 
happy when my daughter Ashley got 
accepted at Scripps, because that is 
where Gabby had gone. She is just out-
standing in every single way and re-
mains so, and thank heaven for that. 
I was a law clerk for Judge John 
Roll, another outstanding man. I have 
to tell you, this is so personal for me. 
I grew up hunting in rural Arizona, and 
I was a very strong advocate for the 
Second Amendment—still am—but we 
have to do something about gun vio-
lence in this country. 
I thank my colleagues for standing 
here with me: Speaker PELOSI, the Sen-
ators, and all of the Arizona delega-
tion. We stand united today in wanting 
to honor Congresswoman Gabrielle Gif-
fords and Federal Judge John Rolls. 
I ask all to please rise for a moment 
of silence. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House will observe a moment of si-
lence. 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speak-
er, if I may, I want to mention the 
other people who were killed that 
morning and wounded, and I yield to 
my colleague RUBEN GALLEGO to read

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, for per-
sonal reasons, I was unable to vote today. 
Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ 
on rollcall No. 2—Previous Question, ‘‘nay’’ on 
rollcall No. 3—H. Res. 779, and ‘‘yea’’ on roll-
call No. 4—H.R. 2881.

DON’T FORGET OUR VETERANS 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, with the escalation of conflict 
in 
Iran, 
we 
are 
currently 
living 
through uncertain times. Today and 
every day the safety of Americans is 
my priority, and I am grateful for the 
brave men and women in our armed 
services who put their lives on the line 
for our safety. 
While we are all united in supporting 
our troops in service, we must always 
remember our veterans at home. 
Throughout my district, I have heard 
so many stories from veterans and 
their loved ones who have told me just 
how difficult the transition back to ci-
vilian life can be. 
Our veterans should not have to 
worry about putting a roof over their 
family’s heads, having access to qual-
ity healthcare, and obstacles to pur-
suing further career opportunities. 
Although we can never fully repay 
them for their service and sacrifice, we 
must all be committed to ensuring that 
veterans and their families have access 
to all of the benefits they have earned 
from their service. 
Let’s not forget our troops, our vet-
erans, and all the brave women and 
men in uniform who sacrifice each day 
for our Nation.

RECOGNIZING WINNERS OF GIRL 
SCOUTS SILVER AWARD 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize three incredible young ladies 
from my district who recently received 
the Girl Scouts Silver Award. 
Saylor Purks, Presley Lomel, and 
Amanda Whittlesey are freshmen at 
high schools in Hillsborough County. 
To earn their Girl Scouts Silver Award, 
these young ladies were tasked with 
creating a project that would make a 
change for the better in their school or 
neighborhood. 
After witnessing their classmates en-
gaging in vaping, the students chose to 
present 
an 
antivaping 
presentation 
about the growing issue and the dan-
gers of tobacco use. 
This message couldn’t be more time-
ly. Saylor, Presley, and Amanda shared 
their presentation during the 2019–2020 
back-to-school orientation, and they 
hope their message can be shared at all 
middle schools and high schools na-
tionwide. 
I would like to personally thank 
these brilliant young leaders for taking 
the time and initiative to educate their 
peers. I am sure we will see more out-
standing things from these very special 
young ladies in the future.

January 8, 2020 
SUPPORT CANCER SCREENINGS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank my colleagues for pass-
ing my important cancer screening bill 
as part of the critical healthcare bill. 
The Removing Barriers to Colorectal 
Cancer Screening Act was added to the 
Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs 
Now Act, H.R. 3, right before it passed 
on December 12. 
My bill would allow Medicare to 
cover the costs when cancerous polyps 
are removed during colorectal cancer 
screenings. No longer will patients 
have to wake up to a surprise charge 
after their screening. These are charges 
that could cost from $400 to $20,000. It 
will improve the health and save the 
lives of millions of Americans. 
My father, former Congressman Don-
ald Payne, Sr., died from colorectal 
cancer. I introduced this bill so that 
more fathers, brothers, and sons can 
survive this deadly cancer. 
f 
RECOGNIZING TROUT UNLIMITED 
AWARD 
WINNER 
JAMES 
‘‘BIG 
JIM’’ HIBBERT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Centre County veteran James ‘‘Big 
Jim’’ Hibbert, a retired Marine Corps 
staff sergeant. 
Big Jim Hibbert honorably served in 
the United States Marine Corps and 
the Army for more than 19 years during 
six overseas deployments, including 
three combat deployments. 
In 2019, during a meeting of the 
Spring Creek Chapter of Trout Unlim-
ited, Jim met a young Army veteran in 
mental distress after his medications 
had been changed. The veteran had lost 
his job and was experiencing a mental 
health crisis. 
Jim had been trained by mental 
health professionals in listening skills 
as 
a 
part 
of 
Trout 
Unlimited’s 
Streamside Mentor program. He imme-
diately took action, establishing a rap-
port and assisting the suicidal veteran. 
Ultimately, Jim helped save his life 
that day. Because of this selfless act 
and for his commitment to his fellow 
veterans, Jim is being recognized by 
Trout 
Unlimited’s 
Veteran 
Service 
Partnership program. 
Big Jim Hibbert continues to serve 
and support his fellow veterans every 
day, and I thank Big Jim. 
f 
HONORING MAYOR RICHARD 
HATCHER 
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor a trailblazing 
public servant and an iconic Hoosier, 
Mayor Richard Hatcher. 
As one of the first African American 
mayors of a major American city, 
Mayor Hatcher was a constant source 
of inspiration not only across Indiana 
but throughout our Nation and around 
the world. 
His history-making election in 1967 
as Gary, Indiana’s first Black mayor 
showed the power of the possible, that 
even in a State once controlled by the 
Ku Klux Klan, a person of color could 
rise above hatred and into the halls of 
power. 
Mayor Hatcher’s example of advo-
cating 
for 
economic 
justice, 
civil 
rights, and equality for every Amer-
ican is why so many of my colleagues 
and I are elected public servants. His 
death is a sad loss for all Americans, 
but his legacy and his work will live 
on. We must all work together to con-
tinue his quest for greater representa-
tion and rights for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest con-
dolences to Mayor Hatcher’s loved 
ones, and I thank him for a life well 
lived. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
TINY 
HOUSE 
PROJECT FOR HOMELESS VET-
ERANS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Cindy 
Kelley and the Chatham Savannah Au-
thority for the Homeless for their work 
in the Tiny House Project for Homeless 
Veterans. 
In November 2019, phase one of the 
Tiny House Project was officially com-
pleted. In this part of the project, 
Chatham Savannah Authority for the 
Homeless provided 23 veterans, two 
spouses, and five pets with places to 
live. Phase two of the project began on 
December 1 and will house an addi-
tional 24 veterans. 
Unfortunately, veteran homelessness 
is one of the most persistent issues fac-
ing those who risked their lives to 
serve our country. 
I could not be more proud than to 
have a project like this one in the First 
Congressional District of Georgia with 
such an innovative solution to ensure 
our veterans are taken care of when 
they return home. 
Along with Ms. Kelley and the Chat-
ham 
Savannah 
Authority 
for 
the 
Homeless, I would like to thank the 
other members of our community that 
were integral in this project, including 
the Home Depot Foundation, Chatham 
Foundation, Nine Line Foundation, 
Dustcom Limited, Hansen Architects, 
Thomas & Hutton, Better Life Prop-
erties, 
Joe 
Marchese 
Construction, 
Wesley Monumental United Methodist 
Church, Sydney Rangeley, Tom Taylor, 
and Henry and Suzanne Croci. 
TRUMP’S TRADE DEALS WILL NOT 
BRING BACK LOST JOBS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tomor-
row, President Trump is scheduled to 
arrive in Toledo, Ohio, for his first 
campaign rally of 2020. 
Does he know that Ohio has lost 
286,332 manufacturing jobs since the 
first NAFTA went into effect and even 
more jobs during his Presidency? Presi-
dent Trump will not bring back those 
jobs. 
And since his NAFTA 2 passed, called 
the USMCA, the U.S. automotive com-
panies have announced plans to expand 
production in Mexico. GM is closing 
numerous U.S. plants, including in 
Ohio, while making popular models in 
Mexico. Ford is even making its new 
electric Mustang in Mexico, the first 
Mustang not to be made in the United 
States of America. 
American 
manufacturing 
workers 
who find reemployment are typically 
taking pay cuts. What is more, the 
President has nothing to say or do 
about providing for pensions for over 
60,000 Ohioans who are going to have 
them cut substantially because he does 
not support the Butch Lewis Act, 
which passed this Congress in this 
House and is waiting for passage over 
in the other body. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to end my 
comments by saying that maybe the 
President, when he lands, should an-
nounce that Toledo’s F–16 Air Guard 
fighter wing should get a complement 
of F–35s, which that unit has duly 
earned. 
f 
HONORING COACH JOHN FURLOW 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, every time 
I come home from Washington, D.C., I 
am welcomed by the sight of Clements 
High School. 
Clements High School has a marquee 
on the corner of Sweetwater and Elkins 
that tells information about their 
school. 
That 
marquee 
was 
heart-
breaking for the Ranger Nation this 
past week. One of our icons, tennis 
coach John Furlow, ‘‘Mr. Clements,’’ 
put on angel wings and flew to Heaven 
last Thursday. 
Coach Furlow was our coach since 
1983. He wasn’t just content with win-
ning titles. He wanted each of his play-
ers to win with class, dignity, and re-
spect the Furlow way. 
His players loved him. They loved the 
fact that coach always had warm Ship-
ley Do-Nuts for that bus ride at 6 a.m. 
before dawn for a Saturday meet. When 
they were coming home, they had to 
stop at Whataburger. 
Coach, thank you for the Shipleys, 
the Whataburger, and for your love. All 
of us are better off because of you. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 8, 2020 
will close with your final statement: 
‘‘Once a Ranger, always a Ranger.’’ 
f 
INCLUDE SCHOOLS IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE 
(Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, recently, I went on 
a tour of a public elementary school in 
my district, a school I attended. 
As I describe what I saw, I want ev-
eryone in this body to imagine having 
to send your child to a school with 
these conditions: mold-covered ceil-
ings, exposed wires and pipes, and lead 
paint chipping down the walls. 
These issues are felt across my city 
of Philadelphia. Three schools in my 
district have had to close this school 
year because of asbestos. 
Schools should foster an environment 
that stimulates intellectual curiosity. 
Instead, our students and teachers are 
surrounded by health hazards. That is 
why I urge this House, later this year, 
when we consider a comprehensive in-
frastructure package, to ensure that 
we include rehabbing and rebuilding 
America’s schools. 
We cannot leave our Nation’s kids 
and educators behind. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ATLANTIC/CAPE 
CASA 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I would like to recognize the various 
CASA branches throughout our region 
that have dedicated themselves to vul-
nerable children in southern New Jer-
sey. 
CASA stands for a court-appointed 
special advocate. They are selfless vol-
unteers who act as the child’s voice 
during legal proceedings. These volun-
teers specialize in understanding the 
physical and emotional needs of the 
child and work tirelessly until finding 
them a permanent home, preferably 
with family members or with an adopt-
ed family. 
Because of organizations like CASA, 
abused or neglected children have 
present, trustworthy adults in their 
lives who sympathize with their strug-
gles, who understand them, and who 
fight on their behalf. 
Therefore, I thank all the CASA 
branches in our district for protecting 
the youth of south Jersey and ensuring 
that every child has a caring home. I 
thank them for their good work, for 
their love, and for the difference that 
they make in people’s lives. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO HUBERT 
LEROY REYNOLDS 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Broth-
er Hubert Leroy Reynolds, an Air 
Force veteran who spent 35 years work-
ing for the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration after he got out of the military. 
Hubert was a stellar member of our 
community, a mentor of young people, 
an active member of the Carey Ter-
centenary AME Church, and a proud 
member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. 
Although I sometimes wore different 
colors, black and gold, I am still proud 
to call him my brother. 
Brother Hubert, may you rest in 
peace. 
f 
TRUMP DAMAGED IRAN’S ABILITY 
TO SOW UNREST 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, the United 
States 
has 
adopted 
an 
aggressive, 
proactive approach of gathering intel-
ligence on our enemies and removing 
those individuals who seek to cause us 
harm in order to save American lives. 
President Trump did just that. On 
January 3, our military, acting under 
the direction of our Commander in 
Chief, killed Iranian General Soleimani 
to protect the lives of Americans and 
to end his reign of terror in the Middle 
East. 
The actions of our President and our 
military have damaged Iran’s ability to 
sow unrest in the Middle East, and we 
have no doubt saved countless lives by 
removing a terrorist who intended to 
harm our Nation. 
We must continue to support our 
troops serving abroad, and we must re-
main vigilant in our fight against ter-
ror and our ongoing efforts to bring 
lasting peace to the Middle East.

COMMENDING PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ON IRAN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
tonight to commend President Trump 
for his actions in dealing with Iran. 
The White House has shown restraint 
up to this point, since Iran has been a 
bad actor going all the way back to 
1979, one of the largest sponsors of ter-
ror the world has ever seen. 
The President has been patient, and, 
finally, with the actions recently at 
the embassy, took that step to elimi-
nate General Soleimani, which was 
needed in order to not only send a mes-
sage but stop a lot of the carnage. 
Moving forward, we hope for and wish 
for true freedom for the people of Iran 
so that they would be able to live more 
like they did pre-1979, with the free-
dom, especially for women, to asso-
ciate as they please. 
This is not about regime change, and 
it is not about wanting to start a war. 
It is about, indeed, helping our neigh-
bors and our colleagues in the Middle 
East to have stability from the state 
sponsor of terror.

THE MATH IS ALWAYS THE MATH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
will cover two or three different sub-
jects today, a little different than we 
typically come and we walk through 
some of the economic data and the con-
cept of I believe the greatest threat to 
our society is not telling the truth 
about the scale of the unfunded liabil-
ities, the promises we have made and 
the fact of the matter that there is no 
mathematical 
way 
we 
keep 
those 
promises. 
I have the blessing of being here in 
Congress. I have been here 9 years, and 
I have grown to just this intense frus-
tration that we do math through a par-
tisan lens. 
We have a family saying: The math 
always wins; the math always eventu-
ally wins. So why is it so hard in this 
place to actually tell the truth, to own 
a calculator and say: Here is what is 
going to happen; here are our demo-
graphics, but here are also the good 
things that are working? 
Another thing I actually got from my 
father years ago is: Figure out what 
works, and do more of that; figure out 
what doesn’t work, and do less of that. 
So think about this. 
Over the Christmas break, I did lots 
and lots of reading and was absolutely 
just furious and frustrated with a num-
ber of columns that I came across talk-
ing about the 2-year anniversary of tax 
reform where we rewrote much of the 
tax code to grow the U.S. economy, and 
we had some of the, I will call them, 
the smartest—at least, the most well- 
known—economist commentators on 
the left side trashing the tax reform. 
Except, you will notice, if any of you 
pull up those articles—if you are will-
ing to—go back and look at the fact 
they use almost no math in them. 
There are no numbers: We just didn’t 
like this. We thought they should have 
done this. 
Having the blessing of being on the 
Committee on Ways and Means, having 
the blessing of having worked on the 
tax reform, I do understand much of 
what the corporate portion of tax re-
form was based on: the Obama adminis-
tration’s recommendations and mod-
eling to make us competitive in the 
world again. 
But, once again, we work in a place 
where, if I walk into the room and I am 
a conservative and I say the sky is 
blue, instantly, there is this knee-jerk 
reaction from my brothers and sisters

on the other side—and, please, under-
stand, we are sinners, too—who say, no, 
it is not. 
The math is the math. 
So just for the fun of it, I pulled up 
a number of the headlines from 2 years 
ago when we were working on tax re-
form, when we had just finished tax re-
form. Liberal columnist after liberal 
columnist basically spoke of Armaged-
don, spoke that the world is going to 
fall apart, said this is going to crush 
and hurt people. 
Mr. Speaker, understand, the last 2 
years have been some of the most re-
markable progress in modern U.S. his-
tory for the working poor. 
We come behind these microphones 
and we pretend we care about the poor, 
particularly the working poor. Do you 
understand what is happening in the 
math? Because the math will always 
win, and the math is the truth. 
When we did tax reform a couple 
years ago, did you think we would live 
in a country with more jobs than work-
ers, where the bottom 10 percent of 
workers, income-wise—what we refer 
to as the working poor—would have 
wages growing more than two times 
the mean and, in some quarters, almost 
four times the mean in wages? 
I know the math gets a little con-
fusing, but it is important. You can’t 
walk around here and say you care 
about the poor, particularly the work-
ing poor, and then not have some little 
joy in your heart about what has gone 
on the last 2 years, particularly this 
last year. 
Remember, last year, a woman with 
no partner in the house had a 7.6 per-
cent growth in wages. We are seeing re-
markable growth in wages for the very 
folks who have been most dispossessed 
over the previous decade. And, yes, I 
will have a chart that actually shows 
that. 
Why is the truth off your calculator 
seen through partisan lenses? Why 
can’t we just take a breath and say, 
hey, something really is working. Was 
it tax reform? Was it some of the 
things done regulatory-wise? 
Because, remember, if you go back 
just a couple years ago—and I have sat 
on the Joint Economic Committee now 
for a few years—we were being told, 
with the headwinds of our demo-
graphics, we were in for stagnation. Do 
you remember 4 years ago? 5 years ago? 
3 years ago? That was the new normal. 
Do we get an apology from the folks 
who wrote these headlines that had 
been so dramatically wrong? 
Let’s just walk through some of the 
tax reform data so we are actually liv-
ing in the reality of the math, and 
there is a simple point I want to make. 
2017 fiscal year, so the end of the fis-
cal year, and then during that time we 
were working on tax reform, do you 
know what the growth and receipts 
were for this country? They were 1 per-
cent. They were 1 percent—function-
ally, not even at inflation. We were 
falling behind. And this is under the 
old tax code that the writers of those 
headlines were functionally defending. 
Do you know what tax receipts—we 
don’t call it revenues; we call it re-
ceipts—were at the end of last fiscal 
year, the one we ended at the end of 
September? We grew slightly more 
than 4 percent in our receipts. 
Now, we still have a spending prob-
lem around here. We have a tremen-
dous demographics problem. That is 
one of the other things we never tell 
the truth about is the substantial por-
tion of our spending is actually driven 
by our demographics, which isn’t Re-
publican or Democratic. 
We are getting older very quickly as 
a society. But, once again, are we able 
to get up in front of our groups at 
home or fellow Members of Congress 
and not see the math through partisan 
lenses, because the math is the math. 
Our birthrates have collapsed as a so-
ciety. Remember, we had only 12 
States last year, in really good eco-
nomic times, that actually had growth 
in their birthrates, and some of those 
were just by a couple hundred. 
We need to tell the truth about the 
math. 
And I have been coming behind this 
microphone almost every week we are 
here saying there is a unified theory of, 
if you do the things that are necessary 
in tax reform, as we are talking about 
right now, and do the things necessary 
in immigration, do the things in labor 
force participation, encouragement, if 
you do the things in adoption of tech-
nology 
that 
crashes 
the 
price 
of 
healthcare, if you do these things and 
bring them all together, we can make 
the math work where we do not get 
crushed, as a nation, by our debt. 
But we can’t even do simple things 
by agreeing upon it. We can’t even 
agree when the math actually says it 
worked. We still have to spin it 
through partisan lenses. 
So the chart next to me is just very, 
very, very simple. It is ‘17, ‘18, ‘19 re-
ceipts—not revenues, receipts. Do you 
notice something? 
Remember, the columnists before, 
the economists, my brothers and sis-
ters on the left were telling us reve-
nues are going to crash, it is the Arma-
geddon, this is the Apocalypse—except 
for one small problem: We have had 
some of the fastest growing revenues 
we have had in modern times. 
The math is the math. 
And, look, I have been there. I have 
been one of those who believe some-
thing. You get the data, and you have 
to swallow and say: I was wrong. 
Except this place is incapable of step-
ping up and saying: Hey, something is 
working. Maybe we should figure out 
what is working and find a way to do 
more of it. 
Because, once again, this has been 
some of the most remarkable wage 
growth for our brothers and sisters, 
particularly in the lower quartiles. I 
hate that terminology, but if you want 
to designate the working poor, we have 
had more movement. 
And there are a couple modelers out 
there—I don’t know if the numbers will 
be real—looking at the 2019 fiscal year 
and saying that might be the first year 
where wage and equality actually 
stayed flat or didn’t grow or maybe 
even shrank because those at the lower 
income spectrum have had the fastest 
growing wage movement. Why can’t we 
take some joy in that and work on it? 
The fact of the matter is the math is 
the math. So a simple point: 2017. 
One more time, 2017, the fiscal year 
before tax reform, 1 percent growth in 
revenues, receipts; last fiscal year, over 
4 percent growth under the new tax 
code. 
How is that possible? 
It turns out it is, and it was possible 
in a really joyous way because people 
were working. 
If you take a step back and think of 
so many of the programs we have as 
the safety net to help our brothers and 
sisters when they are in hard times, 
there should have been dramatically 
less demand on those programs because 
so many people were working. 
If you look at the BLS numbers, Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics numbers, the 
numbers that have moved back into 
the labor force were now—what?—over 
63 percent labor force participation. I 
can show you an economic paper from 
3 or 4 years ago saying we were never 
going to get close to that again until 
we get through the baby boomers. 
Something is working. 
We are seeing numbers where hun-
dreds and hundreds and hundreds of 
thousands of people are coming back 
into the labor force who were not even 
looking. Why isn’t this joyful? 
Look, let me relay a simple experi-
ence. 
The Phoenix area, we have a home-
less campus. I have been, on and off, in-
volved with it for many, many years. I 
believe we do something very, very 
well. We do a concentration of services 
with many churches and charities: 
Over here, dental work; over here, you 
get your ID; over here, there is like 24- 
hour-a-day AA meetings and here are 
some bunk beds for those; over here, 
St. Joseph the Worker that will help 
individuals get work, the Catholic 
charity. And they have a situation 
where they have a stack of job opportu-
nities because there is such a labor 
shortage in the Phoenix market. 
I am very pleased we just worked out 
a deal, or they worked out a deal, with 
Lyft to help deal with the transition 
barrier of getting these individuals to 
work. 
But shouldn’t there be joy in this 
body and our society that there is such 
a labor shortage that businesses and 
organizations are taking chances on 
the folks we used to just completely 
write off? 
b 1800 
Remember, it was only a couple of 
years ago, we would give speeches 
around here; if you hadn’t finished high 
school, if you hadn’t developed certain 
skills you were going to be part of the 
permanent underclass. We were writing

January 8, 2020 
you off. We were walking away from 
you as a society. 
And guess what happened? 
Something happened, whether it be 
the Tax Code or other things that we 
have done that there is such a demand 
for their labor, for their work, and 
their wages are going up faster than 
any other quartile. 
You can’t come behind these micro-
phones and give speeches about how 
you care, and then not actually take a 
step back and say, something is work-
ing. How do we do more of it? 
So let’s actually take a look at the 
reality of the math of the last couple of 
decades. The red line are the high-in-
come earners. The blue line are those 
in the 25 percent or lower quartile. So 
let’s call it the bottom-25-percent quar-
tile. 
And I know this geeks out, but let’s 
go to about 2010 and over. And you see 
through 2010, 2015, about 2016, higher- 
income earners were winning the bat-
tle. Huge separation. They were mak-
ing money, while that lower population 
that we were walking away from, that 
didn’t have the high school education, 
didn’t have the higher skill set, their 
wages were crashing. 
And then something happened over 
here. That’s about the time of tax re-
form. Do you notice the separation? 
It turns out their labor became valu-
able, became something in demand, be-
came something that employers had to 
pay more for. Isn’t that what we were 
trying to accomplish? It is in the math. 
So it frustrates me that you will 
come across these articles that com-
pletely demagogue tax reform; refuse 
to actually use the math; and then not 
embrace the fact that it has been one 
of the most remarkable couple of years 
in modern history in the United States 
of the working poor starting to see 
their wages move forward, move up, 
their labor having value in our society 
again. 
Look, for many of us, we truly be-
lieve economic growth is moral. It 
helps families; it helps individuals; it 
helps self-worth. It produces oppor-
tunity. 
Yet, we seem to completely turn the 
discussion of the things that create 
that economic growth into a partisan 
battle, a partisan malaise. And it 
breaks my heart, because the chart I 
just put up, this is the greatest threat 
not only to my 4-year-old daughter, 
but I believe to every American. 
Do you understand what is coming at 
us? 
This is a 30-year chart. It is not infla-
tion-adjusted. But the math is true and 
honest because it is done by an outside 
group that is nonpartisan. 
If I strip Social Security and Medi-
care out of the 30-year number—we 
have $23 trillion in the bank. If you 
pull Social Security and mostly, it is 
mostly Medicare, back in, the promise, 
these are earned promises that we have 
a moral obligation to keep, we are $103 
trillion in debt. This is over the next 30 
years. 
Isn’t that an incredible moral obliga-
tion for this body to tell the truth on? 
Because these sorts of numbers, you 
can take every dime of the rich and 
you don’t get anywhere near it. You 
can cut the benefits, and you still don’t 
get—you cannot deal with these num-
bers and not crash the U.S. economy 
and crash the world economy by doing 
so. 
Our office, and a handful of others, 
we have been trying to make the argu-
ment: tax reform, grow the economy. 
Incentives to be in the labor force, 
grow the economy. Legalize technology 
that can crash the price of healthcare 
because so much of this Medicare here, 
that is the massive driver of the debt. 
We can have disruptions. Do you re-
alize almost 30 percent of that Medi-
care spending is just going to be diabe-
tes? So investment in diabetes research 
is a smart investment. 
But also, so are other technologies. 
The thing you can blow into that in-
stantly tells you you have the flu, and 
allowing it, that technology, to be part 
of how you keep yourself healthy. 
But the reality here is, there is no 
magic bullet. You have got to grow the 
economy. And we have demonstrated 
the growth in these 24 months since we 
did tax reform it is working. One of the 
pillars is working. How do we build off 
of it? Because you don’t try to make 
major policy changes in a time of eco-
nomic stress. Do it in a time when you 
actually have economic stability and 
build off of it, because this is the great-
est threat to our society. It is demo-
graphics. It is not Republican or Demo-
crat. 
It is baby boomers. There are 74 mil-
lion of us who were born in an 18-year 
period. We earned our benefits. The 
problem is—what is it? For the Medi-
care spending, we will put in, what? 
$150,000. We are going to take out close 
to $500,000. Now multiply that dif-
ference by 74 million. These are the 
issues that should be driving every bit 
of policy. 
The simple way is to give this a 
thought experiment: the next 5 years, 
just the growth—next 5 years, just the 
growth of Social Security, Medicare, 
and the other healthcare entitlements, 
just the growth, equals the entire De-
fense Department spending. 
So if you start to do that math, you 
could functionally get rid of every por-
tion of discretionary spending except 
defense, and you buy yourself 5 years. 
I know this is uncomfortable. It is 
very hard to go home and talk to con-
stituents that, on the Republican side, 
we can take care of waste and fraud. 
On the Democrat side, we can tax rich 
people more. That math is completely 
fraudulent. 
Why is it so hard to pull out a calcu-
lator? 
I accept we work substantially in a 
math-free zone, but when we do math, 
don’t see it through the lenses of par-
tisanship. It is math. 
So, look, I wanted to do a little 
cheerleading for my home. I am blessed 
to be from Arizona. We have worked 
really hard to be friendly to those who 
are willing to come to our state and 
open up new businesses. We have 
worked really hard to limit the bu-
reaucracy. We have worked really hard 
to make it easy, as a State, for you to 
file paperwork online, to do these 
things efficiently, and our State has 
benefited. 
We are functioning at the very top of 
economic growth, population growth. 
There have actually even been quarters 
in the last couple of years where we 
have also had the fastest wage growth. 
But it is a demonstration that many, 
many Americans are making economic 
decisions, packing up their lives in a 
lot of parts of the country and moving 
to places like Arizona. I think we are 
number three in total growth. And 
when you consider we are only a State 
of about 7.25 million people, when you 
add, you know, when you do the per 
population growth, we are at the very 
top. 
Arizona, we should be very, very 
proud. We have been very disciplined. 
We have built good infrastructure. We 
have managed our water supplies. 
Power, electrical power is abundant. 
And we have been friendly to those 
willing to bring businesses because 
they create jobs, they create opportu-
nities. They create growth in wages. 
Now, it looks like the rest of the 
country is starting to see the head-
lines. So a community I grew up 
around, Scottsdale, I believe, just got 
rated number one for being able to find 
a job. Much of the rest of the commu-
nity, incredibly well. 
But think of some of the—I am try-
ing to build an argument here that if 
economic growth is moral, then you 
see headlines like this, where when we 
do surveys about food insecurity, food 
insecurity is the lowest in a decade be-
cause of that economic growth, because 
of those folks that we were writing off 
just a couple of years ago who now, 
their labor is in demand, their wages 
are up, and we start to see headlines 
like ‘‘Food Insecurity At a Decade Low 
in Arizona.’’ 
Why is it so hard to understand doing 
smart tax policy, doing so many other 
smart economic policies truly are the 
path to helping our brothers and sisters 
who have less? 
We always start and end with this 
chart. If we care about what is actually 
going on, if Congress intends to keep 
the promises to Americans for their 
Social Security and Medicare, if we be-
lieve it is a moral obligation of our so-
ciety to keep that promise, then you 
need to deal with the reality that the 
unfunded liabilities are monstrous. 
There is a path, but it is not a path 
of paying off the debt. It is basically a 
path of, I believe, in our model in our 
office, staying about 95 percent debt to 
GDP, so we don’t blow up and get 
through the demographic bubble that 
is those of us who are baby boomers. 
But we have to do everything. You 
have to have that and legalize tech-
nology that crashes the price of so

many things, makes the environment 
cleaner, makes healthcare much more 
affordable and available. Employment, 
we have to do everything for those who 
are older, to encourage them to partici-
pate in the labor force. Add some 
‘‘spiffs,’’ add some benefits. 
How do we get millennial men that 
are still dramatically underperforming 
in showing up in the labor force? 
About a year ago, we had an amazing 
breakthrough, 
mathematically-wise, 
millennial females entering the work-
force. 
Every policy that moves through 
here we should test; does this benefit 
economic growth? 
When we work on immigration pol-
icy, are we doing a talent-based immi-
gration system, where we don’t care 
about your religion, your gender, or 
who you cuddle with or anything like 
that? We care about the economic vi-
tality you bring to our society. 
How do we encourage family forma-
tion? 
Think of that. This one article here 
talks about only 12 States actually had 
positive birth rates over the previous 
year. 
I know we get caught up in today’s 
shiny object; you know, whether it is 
the we hate the President side of this 
room, or we feel we are stuck defend-
ing. And we are completely missing 
what is going to end up driving all pub-
lic policy in the next couple of years, 
and that is the fact that we are going 
to be crushed by our debt. 
There is a path. My fear is this cur-
rent Congress, are we actually capable 
of doing complex policy, lots of com-
plex policy on every issue, and seeing it 
as a unified theory to maximize eco-
nomic vitality so we actually have the 
receipts, so we keep the promises that 
we go home and tell our constituents 
we are working for? But, yet, then we 
come here and we deny basic math. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF RICHARD GORDON HATCHER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RUSH) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, it is my dis-
tinct honor and privilege to come be-
fore the House this evening to cele-
brate the memory of a major trail-
blazer in our Nation, one who was a 
fierce crusader for justice and equality, 
an American who was a quiet man, 
with a quiet demeanor, but a giant in 
terms of his accomplishments, his 
courage, and the things he did not only 
for his local constituency, the city of 
Gary, Indiana, but the African Amer-
ican community and America at large. 
Mr. Speaker, I am speaking of the 
one and only, the first Black mayor of 
Gary, Indiana, Mayor Richard Gordon 
Hatcher. 
Sadly, Mayor Hatcher passed away at 
the age of 86 on the 13th of December, 
2019. Although he is no longer with us, 
his legacy lives on. His legacy, his 
work, his love, his sacrifices continue 
to be felt in these very Halls of Con-
gress, throughout the city hall of Gary, 
Indiana, and indeed, throughout these 
State legislative halls, these halls of 
municipal governments in cities all 
across this Nation. 
Mayor Hatcher was one who carved 
and made a way for African Americans 
who are elected officials even to this 
very day. When Mayor Hatcher was 
first elected mayor of Gary, Indiana, 
there were but few elected officials of 
African American descent in the Na-
tion, but there now exists over 10,000 
African American elected officials. In 
some supernatural sense, because of 
the hard work, the insight, the cour-
age, and the commitment of Mayor 
Hatcher, his sterling example, we all 
stand on the shoulders of Mayor Rich-
ard Gordon Hatcher. 
Mayor 
Hatcher’s 
surprise 
victory 
over the political machine in Gary, In-
diana, in 1967 was indeed a watershed 
moment for Black political participa-
tion in this Nation. Along with the 
election of Mayor Carl Stokes, the first 
African American mayor of Cleveland, 
Ohio, Mayor Hatcher became the first 
Black mayor of a major U.S. city, the 
city of Gary, Indiana. 
Mr. Speaker, in his two decades of 
service as Gary’s mayor, Mayor Hatch-
er fought valiantly in his beloved Gary 
and throughout his beloved Nation for 
fair political representation for those 
whose voices had been previously dis-
missed, disregarded, and downright ig-
nored for most of American history. 
When Mayor Hatcher was elected to 
lead a deeply segregated Gary, Indiana, 
only two of the city’s department 
heads were African Americans, in a 
city that was actually over 50 percent 
African American. Within 10 years of 
Mayor Hatcher’s tenure as mayor, 25 of 
Gary’s 40 department heads were Afri-
can Americans. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, those who 
worked for Gary’s government began to 
look more like Gary’s citizens, those 
who were supposed to be working on 
behalf of the citizens of Gary, Indiana. 
As mayor of Gary, Mayor Hatcher 
worked very closely with his congres-
sional delegation and the Democratic 
administration in the White House. He 
secured millions of dollars in Federal 
funding for job training programs for 
Gary’s citizens and subsidized housing 
for Gary’s citizens, building up a vi-
brant economy in his beloved city of 
Gary, similarly and singlehandedly, in 
some instances, ensuring that those 
communities that were previously un-
derserved received their fair share of 
city services, Federal funding, and Fed-
eral dollars. 
Mayor Hatcher’s herculean efforts to 
ensure fair representation extended far 
beyond Gary. As a young man, I was in-
spired and intrigued by the electoral 
and political processes and systems be-
cause of the tenure, political career, 
and outstanding accomplishments of 
Mayor Richard Hatcher. 
Mayor Hatcher was a visionary, a 
man who not only talked the talk, but 
he walked the walk. On the streets of 
Gary, he was highly visible. 
With all of that, his vision even sur-
passed and transcended Gary. In 1972, 
he organized the inaugural and historic 
National Black Political Convention in 
Gary. I was there. I attended. I saw it 
in action. This National Black Polit-
ical Convention convened with two 
goals: 
establishing 
an 
independent 
Black political agenda and electing 
more Black officials to public office. 
Never before, not at any time, had this 
been done. 
Over 8,000 individual American citi-
zens attended this historic occasion, 
including some who are icons even 
today in our Nation, including Rev-
erend Jesse Louis Jackson, Coretta 
Scott King, Betty Shabazz, Bobby 
Seale, and my colleague from Chicago, 
Congressman DANNY K. DAVIS. Many, 
many others were involved, inspired, 
educated, and learned the value of the 
vote and heard for the first time that a 
voteless people is a hopeless people, all 
because of the single vision of this one 
American giant, Mayor Richard Gor-
don Hatcher. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored and hum-
bled to speak in this well about this 
giant of a man, telling all who have a 
listening ear and a seeing eye about 
the work of Mayor Hatcher and that 
historic National Black Political Con-
vention. It was not just fighting the 
windmills, Don Quixote-like. It pro-
duced results. 
At the time of this convention, there 
were just 14 African American Mem-
bers of Congress, just 14. Today, there 
are 56 African American Members of 
Congress, 56 living and breathing, hard-
working Members of this Congress who 
are a result of the vision of Mayor 
Hatcher and who were inspired by his 
life and what he had accomplished. 
He was our inspiration. He gave all of 
us an exceedingly high standard that 
we live by even today. 
b 1830 
Mayor 
Richard 
Gordon 
Hatcher 
spurred a wave of Black civic partici-
pation that reverberated all through-
out America. In 1973, just 1 year, 365 
days, after the Gary convention, De-
troit elected its first African American 
mayor, Mayor Coleman Young, Atlanta 
elected its first African American 
mayor, Mayor Maynard Jackson, and 
Los Angeles elected its first African 
American mayor, Mayor Tom Bradley. 
All across this Nation, major cities all 
across this Nation saw a witness, and 
participated and celebrated the elec-
tion of mayors in major cities all 
across this Nation. 
The legacy, the inspiration, the ex-
ample, the instruction just didn’t stop 
in 1973. Even some 10 years later,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H57 
January 8, 2020 
Mayor Harold Washington was elected 
mayor of the city of Chicago following 
the Gary model. 
Congressman DAVIS and I were on the 
front lines in Mayor Washington’s elec-
tion. He challenged us to register 50,000 
new voters, and we rose up to the chal-
lenge, a la just like being cognizant of 
what was going on in Gary, Indiana. 
That voter registration, that election 
rocked the entrenched Chicago polit-
ical establishment, political machine. 
The 
renowned 
Richard 
J. 
Daley’s 
Democratic machine was overturned in 
1983, inspired in no small respect by 
Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher in the 
city of Gary, Indiana. 
It just didn’t stop there, Mr. Speaker. 
The story didn’t end there. It kept de-
veloping, it kept materializing. The 
civic awakening that was started in 
Gary, Indiana, with the election in 1967 
of Mayor Hatcher, which ensued with 
the election of Mayor Harold Wash-
ington, inspired a young man who was 
living in Los Angeles to move to Chi-
cago, Gary’s neighbor. He wanted to be 
a part of what was going on in Chicago, 
in Gary, Indiana, in urban areas, and 
major cities throughout the Nation. It 
inspired him, a young law student 
named Barack Obama, to move to Chi-
cago, to the south side of Chicago to 
start community organizing and ulti-
mately to become a State senator from 
the State of Illinois, then to become 
the U.S. Senator from the State of Illi-
nois, and then finally to become Presi-
dent of these United States. 
So in no uncertain terms, the over-
whelming outstanding achievements, 
the miraculously determined achieve-
ments of Mayor Richard Gordon Hatch-
er led to the election of Barack Obama 
as President of the United States. 
Mayor Hatcher was pivotal in Rev-
erend Jesse Jackson’s transcendent 
1984 and 1988 Presidential campaigns. 
In 1988, Mayor Hatcher served as his 
campaign vice chairman, and Reverend 
Jackson in that historic campaign 
earned over 6.7 million votes and Rev-
erend Jackson, through the hard work 
and the inspiration of Mayor Richard 
Gordon Hatcher, won 11 primary con-
tests. 
You can’t undervalue, underestimate 
how important that was. This hap-
pened before the election of Barack 
Obama. 
We all stand indebted to Richard 
Gordon Hatcher and his life, the life 
that he lived and the life that he led. 
Mayor Hatcher’s victory was a clar-
ion call to all of us who aspired and are 
inspired to serve as elected officials in 
our Nation. 
If we work hard, harness the imagi-
nation, speak to the real need of our 
constituents, we could also raise our 
voices in the spirit of equity and fair-
ness, justice; that we could all stand 
not only in the well of the Congress, 
but in the State houses, in the city 
halls of our Nation and of States and 
municipalities all over this country, 
even in the White House. 
We miss Mayor Hatcher. We will miss 
his counsel. 
Again, he was a man who was not a 
self-promoter. He was quiet, in some 
sense professorial, in some sense laid 
back, but a mighty, mighty, mighty, 
mighty warrior, a mighty man, a giant. 
I am just grateful for all that he has 
done for this Nation, all that he has 
done for poor people all across this Na-
tion, for the middle class all across this 
Nation, all that he has done for African 
Americans not only in Gary, and cer-
tainly in Gary, but in Chicago, Los An-
geles, New York, Philadelphia, Cleve-
land, Detroit, other places all across 
this Nation. 
He inspired young people, young pro-
fessionals to look at public service as 
being an honorable pursuit, an honor-
able career, profession, and get in there 
and do something not just for yourself, 
but do something for your Nation, for 
your community, and for people who 
need a voice, those who are voiceless. 
In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
extend 
my 
condolences 
to 
Mayor 
Hatcher’s family, his wife, Ruthellyn, 
his daughters, and let them know that 
our prayers are with them, and their 
loss is great, our loss is great. We lost 
a friend, we lost a colleague, we lost a 
champion, but in some sense, we lost 
someone who was a steadfast, rock 
solid inspiration to us all. 
We mourn the loss of this American 
giant, former Mayor Richard Gordon 
Hatcher. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY), a gentleman who represents 
the city of Gary right now, another 
man of unmatched wisdom and intel-
lect, the chairman of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Defense, and 
my friend and colleague. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
deeply appreciate Mr. RUSH yielding 
time to me. I also thank him for orga-
nizing this Special Order. I thank my 
colleague from Chicago, Mr. DAVIS, for 
participating, and earlier today, ANDRE´ 
CARSON, a Member from Indianapolis, 
for also expressing deep regard for 
Mayor Hatcher. 
Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the 
gentleman’s eloquence in describing 
the incredible contribution that Rich-
ard Gordon Hatcher made to our world 
and, in particular, those most in need. 
He is absolutely correct: it certainly 
transcended the city of Gary and his 
immediate responsibilities. 
Everyone here knows the vast and 
immeasurable 
contributions 
that 
Mayor Hatcher has provided to advance 
the cause of civil rights and racial 
equality in all of our communities and 
throughout our Nation. 
On a personal level, I would note that 
my father, John Visclosky, also was 
mayor of Gary. While the mayors may 
not have always agreed on every issue, 
Mayor Hatcher always treated my fa-
ther with respect and grace, and for 
that, I will always be grateful. 
Everyone he met and worked with 
was treated with similar dignity and 
respect. 
Mayor Hatcher’s value of respect is 
one we should all strive to emulate. 
It was through this value that he be-
came a trailblazer for the city of Gary 
and our Nation. It was also through his 
selfless leadership and desire to bring 
other people along that led to count-
less other trailblazers for civil rights. 
One of those trailblazers who was in-
spired by Richard Gordon Hatcher, as 
Mr. RUSH pointed out so eloquently, 
was my predecessor from the First 
Congressional District of Indiana, Rep-
resentative Katie Hall. 
b 1845 
When Mrs. Hall was sworn into office 
as U.S. Congressperson from the First 
District, she became the first Black 
woman from Indiana to serve in the 
United States House of Representa-
tives. Again, as Mr. RUSH pointed out, 
there are many more African Ameri-
cans in this Chamber today. 
Representative Hall was also the 
Member of Congress who sponsored the 
legislation that was signed into law 
that established Dr. Martin Luther 
King’s birthday as a Federal holiday. 
As we take time honoring Dr. King this 
month, let us remember that that leg-
islation’s sponsor was mentored by 
Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher. 
As a resident of Gary, I would con-
clude by saying that I knew Richard 
first and foremost as a dedicated hus-
band and a proud and loving father and 
grandfather. 
In 
his 
three 
beloved 
daughters and six grandchildren, it is 
plainly evident that he has instilled his 
exemplary dedication to hard work, the 
value of education, and a commitment 
to public service. 
Again, I appreciate that this time 
was organized. Let us never lose sight 
of the example that Mayor Hatcher 
provided for all of us to follow. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
his candid remarks, and he also stands 
in the wonderful splendor of Mayor 
Hatcher’s legacy and of his work and 
his commitment to public service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), 
who is my colleague, my true friend, 
my coconspirator. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, let me, first of all, thank Rep-
resentative RUSH for his leadership, his 
vision, his diligence, and how well he 
has reminded us of those glory years 
during the 1960s and 1970s that we call 
movement years. 
As I looked at the photograph of 
Mayor Hatcher, I couldn’t help but 
smile thinking that, in 1967, that is the 
way we looked. We obviously had more 
hair. It was a different color. 
And it is a great reminder of what it 
was like during that period of time. 
There was so much momentum in the 
air in terms of hope for change in 
America from what America had been 
to some to what America was to be-
come. 
I was thinking that, with just a little 
different twist, I might have ended up 
in Gary, Indiana, rather than in Chi-
cago, Illinois; because, as we were leav-
ing the South, coming to other places

to live and work, I didn’t know that I 
had a bunch of relatives who lived in 
Gary who were also involved in poli-
tics: the Allen family who grew up, 
some of them, with Mayor Hatcher at 
the same time. My cousin Dozier Allen, 
and then his son, who is now on the 
county board, and his cousin, who was 
on the county board before that, Roo-
sevelt Allen. If I had known that the 
Allens were there and were my cousins, 
I might have gone to Gary instead of 
coming to Chicago. 
But I remember 1967. I remember 
1972. I can remember those huge crowds 
of people who converged on Roosevelt 
High School where the National Black 
Political Convention was taking place 
and all of the eloquent speakers who 
were there: poets, Baraka, Ron Del-
lums, and Charlie Diggs from Detroit. 
It was the most exciting thing I had 
ever done, I mean, just to be in the 
presence of all this action. 
It seemed as though each speaker 
would be more eloquent and more com-
pelling than whoever spoke before 
them. And, of course, Mayor Hatcher, 
as the host and the person who had 
brought everybody together, was just 
off the charts. 
You have pointed out how much his 
presence, not only on an individual 
basis, 
means 
as 
a 
motivator, 
stimulater, and activator for so many 
others throughout the country who de-
cided they wanted to do this. They 
could do this because Richard Hatcher 
had shown the way. 
And the individual cities that looked 
at Gary. 
Of course, Gary was a different Gary: 
steel mills, steel jobs, opportunities, 
people were flocking. So a lot of folks 
who don’t look at history in terms of 
understanding and knowing how things 
became and have become the way that 
they were, I mean, it is good to see 
Gary on the way back. 
It has been good to work with Mayor 
Rudy Clay, with Mayor Karen Wilson, 
and with others who are using what 
Mayor Hatcher did. 
It is good to know his daughter. It is 
good to have come in contact with the 
individuals who are there who have re-
fused to give up. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY for being a real part of the re-
birth and redevelopment and recon-
stitution and reinstitution of Gary, In-
diana, to become one of our cities that 
we knew in the past and so we can 
think of what is yet to come. 
I thank Congressman RUSH again for 
his vision. I thank him for his fore-
sight, for his insight, and for giving us 
to share, along with Representative 
CARSON and Representative VISCLOSKY 
and himself, so that people who really 
didn’t know the history of Mayor Rich-
ard Gordon Hatcher might have a bet-
ter understanding of what his presence 
has meant, not just to Gary, but to 
America. 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, as I close 
this significant moment in the annals 
of this Congress, let me just say to the 
family of Mayor Hatcher once again, as 
I reflect on my public career, as I re-
flect on all of us who are public offi-
cials who represent African American 
communities, as I reflect on all public 
officials, but particularly those of us 
who have historically been denied the 
opportunity to serve, I want to thank 
this wonderful man for giving me and 
others the audacity: the audacity to 
act, to believe, to run, to get elected, 
to lead. 
Mr. Speaker, I give thanks to Mayor 
Hatcher for showing us the way to con-
tribute, to add our voices to the plight 
of those who are seeking the American 
Dream, and for giving us the audacity, 
the audacity to act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
PUT MANUFACTURING ECONOMY 
AT THE FOREFRONT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this evening to recognize a new year 
and a new decade in which we find our-
selves, the second half of this session of 
the 116th Congress, an incredible dele-
gation of individuals who have come 
together on behalf of the American 
people, for the American people, to 
usher in an agenda of renewal, of 
standing up for everyday hardworking 
Americans: to protect their healthcare; 
to advocate for infrastructure and 
good, sound infrastructure spending; as 
well as to stand up for hardworking 
Americans who have always played by 
the rules and have worked for their re-
tirement savings, my pensioners back 
home in Michigan. 
It was a delight to close out the end 
of the decade back home in my district 
with so many of my beloved constitu-
ents and the community members who 
make us so strong. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that on Jan-
uary 3, 2020, this new year, this new 
decade, 1 year from when this Congress 
was sworn in, this session of Congress 
was sworn in, the headline became pro-
nounced that industrial activity has 
come down to its lowest point since 
2009, since the heart of the recession, 
with production, inventories, and new 
orders falling. 
These are real headlines. These are 
headlines that affect the heart of 
America. And while so much hums in 
our national media and in our national 
news, this is a reality for so many. This 
is a reality for Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict. 
We were delighted, we were pleased 
to see us pass the USMCA overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan for the manufacturers, 
for the manufacturing economy, for 
the hardworking union members who 
will get a better deal because we are 
advocating for buy American content. 
We know the road to implementation 
will be long, but it is an implementa-
tion that the suppliers in my district, 
from Auburn Hills down to Plymouth, 
an implementation they are planning 
for. Yet the reality is such that a man-
ufacturing recession hangs before us, a 
manufacturing recession as marked by 
low levels of productivity. 
b 1900 
Over the last 6 months of 2019, manu-
facturers lost a net of 23,000 jobs and 
average hours worked fell to its lowest 
levels in 8 years. Who is talking about 
this? Your Congresswoman from Michi-
gan’s 11th District is talking about this 
here tonight. 
The reality of tariffs has cost us. 
Tariffs imposed have cost U.S. corpora-
tions $34 billion as of October 2019, as 
marked by that day since they were 
implemented. 
Also, as October 2019 has marked, 
manufacturing taxpayers have paid $1.8 
billion in 2019 in additional tariffs, in 
additional money. I talk to these em-
ployers. I talk to these small busi-
nesses. I talk to the lifeblood of the 
American economy, and they are pay-
ing more. They are squeezed. Their 
margins are tight. Can this continue? 
No, it cannot. 
So that agenda that we are ushering 
in here the first month of 2020, is that 
we do not forget that we need to ad-
dress the problem of tariffs for our 
manufacturers. We have given cer-
tainty with USMCA. We knew we need-
ed to give that certainty, in part, be-
cause the jobs were going to go else-
where. The investment was going to be 
made elsewhere. It wasn’t going to be 
made in the American workforce. 
We are in a global race to compete. 
We have got to compete as Americans. 
We have got to compete as manufactur-
ers in small communities, in suburban 
communities like the ones that I have 
the privilege and honor of representing. 
Comprised within that are the people 
who are going to work every single 
day: in snowstorms, in rainstorms, on 
sunny days, in the middle of summer, 
putting food on the table. 
We look at wages and we ask our-
selves as we are now in this third dec-
ade of this millennium of this century: 
What has transpired with wages? The 
alarming headline as we were closing 
out 2019 was that the richest, the 
wealthiest 500 individuals increased 
their wealth in 2019 by $1 trillion, by 
over $1 trillion, when wages for our 
middle class have remained stagnant; 
where wages for the lowest earners in 
our economy—we are still advocating 
to raise the minimum wage from $7, 
just about. It is the year 2020. 
Who is working those jobs, by the 
way? Single mothers; people who have 
played by the rules and who have chil-
dren, who aren’t just working tem-
porary jobs. This is the promise of 
America. This is the dream of America, 
Mr. Speaker, that we are representing, 
and that I am fighting for all of you, 
where my sleeves are rolled up. The 
things that I am eyeing here. 
Because if we don’t start addressing 
this, we stop winning. We stop having

an American-first agenda. So we have 
got to put the manufacturing economy 
at the forefront. We have got to look at 
the plight of exports. We saw that with 
the 
USMCA, 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
USMCA. 
Over 95 percent of the world’s con-
sumers are outside of American bor-
ders. We want to sell the best-in-class, 
American-made product from Michigan 
by the best-in-class Michigan work-
force to the world. We want to get it 
into these markets. 
So we look at how we can be smart. 
We can look at the things that we did 
during the big recession, right, the big 
recession of 2008–2009, and what got us 
out of that, the strategies and the poli-
cies that we put forward in export 
agenda, Mr. Speaker. 
The Speaker knows this from where 
the gentleman sits. I acknowledge my 
friend from South Carolina who is in a 
port destination. 
We got smart about how we sold 
American product. We invested in 
small 
business, 
awards—the 
States 
Small Business Act is what I am talk-
ing about. It awarded money through 
the Small Business Administration to 
States like Michigan. We qualify for 
these dollars. This was $200,000 that the 
State of Michigan got and made awards 
to companies who applied, who met the 
qualifications, the small businesses, 
and gave them seed money that they 
matched with their own money to go 
sell their products in Europe and over-
seas and to different consumers. The 
results were exponential. That money 
paid for itself. 
Then the political tides changed and 
we got rid of it, and we are still here 10 
years later trying to figure out how we 
are going to make those investments. 
Well, let’s go back and look at the 
States Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. 
Let’s figure out how we can get in 
front of a manufacturing recession. It 
is technical. Look at auto sales. They 
are down. They are down in 2019. Not as 
dramatic as it was in 2008 when we had 
the largest drop in automotive sales in 
the history the automobile. 
Auto sales are down because hard-
working men and women put things on 
the line. They went on strike. They 
asked 
for 
better 
healthcare. 
They 
asked for fair wages. They asked for re-
tirement 
packages. 
When 
we 
talk 
about middle-class job growth, when 
we talk about growing our middle 
class, what are we talking about? We 
are talking about lifting people out of 
poverty. 
The facts are clear: productivity is 
not at its highest level. Productivity is 
at some of its lowest level, and inequal-
ity is at some of its highest level; in-
equality matched by wage disparity, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Then we have this interesting reality 
with our skills gap in this country, and 
this is something I hear all over my 
district. Every time I am talking to a 
manufacturer, or an educator, or a 
champion in my community, it is: 
Where are we going to find the work-
ers? 
Just today, I was talking with folks 
from the coding organization, Hour of 
Code, and they gave me a few minutes. 
And I had the opportunity to be re-
minded that we have tens of thousands 
of open computer science jobs in this 
country, and we are not graduating the 
level of computer scientists that we 
need to graduate to fill those jobs. 
We have got to invest in our own. 
This is something in Michigan we know 
very well. We have got great univer-
sities. Our students stick around. We 
want them to stick around. That is 
part of my charge here. It is what I am 
trying to represent as your Member of 
Congress, the attraction agenda, the 
boomerangs, those who maybe took a 
job or an educational opportunity else-
where but have come back to invest in 
our community. We see that all over. 
We see that in the rich innovation 
transpiring throughout the district: 
two-to-one patents in autonomous ve-
hicle technology; 75 percent of the R&D 
taking place here. 
And then we remind ourselves, in the 
previous Congress, in the 115th Con-
gress, there was a big tax bill that got 
passed into law. It was so partisan in 
certain respects. And now, the effects 
of this tax bill are playing out. Who 
has benefited and who hasn’t? The 
wealthiest 
individuals, 
Americans, 
have seen their wealth increase by over 
$1 trillion. Our middle class is still pay-
ing. They are not seeing the growth 
that they have expected to see. 
Many large, multinational corpora-
tions are paying nothing in taxes, 
while we all pay, and, yet, our deficit 
has ballooned yet again. In this case, it 
ballooned astronomically, Mr. Speaker. 
It ballooned by $1.5 trillion as pro-
jected from this tax scam. 
When are we going to start investing 
in the middle class? That is what we 
are up to here. That is what the second 
part of this session of Congress is 
about, the infrastructure guarantee. 
When we say, guess what? Every single 
American has got the right to clean 
and safe drinking water, to fresh air to 
breathe, to safe and maintained road-
ways and bridges so we can continue to 
create jobs. 
This is why I created the Congres-
sional Plastic Solutions Task Force in 
partnership with our Congressional Re-
cycling Caucus. We have a plastics 
problem globally and in this country. 
Why? Because of a fallacious trade war, 
tariff war, that has been started. 
China stopped taking our recycled 
goods. They stopped taking our plas-
tics. So you talk to your municipali-
ties, and who is paying? They are. Who 
is paying? You are; our taxpayers, yet 
again; our communities, yet again. If 
you didn’t know that, your munici-
pality of residence pays to do the recy-
cling. 
Now, let’s think about this really 
clearly, because I believe we have the 
greatest opportunity to create and 
awaken an incredible supply chain in 
recycling technology in this country. 
As the chair of the Research and 
Technology Subcommittee of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology, I had a hearing about this. It 
was absolutely brilliant: industry, re-
search, academia, and my munici-
pality—Paul Sincock, the Plymouth 
City manager—all saying the same 
thing: Give us standards. Mark the 
goods. Tell us what to do with them. 
And then let’s think about how we can 
invest, and pilot, and inspire; more so, 
get strategic about how we actually 
want to do recycling in this country to 
create jobs. 
Because if we think about the sorting 
and the materials and what goes into 
it, the onus is on all of us. It is on us 
as a Federal Government and as a part-
ner with local government, State gov-
ernment, and individual consumers, 
and the companies who want to see the 
reuse of these materials. 
So we are quite enthusiastic about 
these opportunities, but it begins with 
investing in R&D, research and devel-
opment. And this is what kind of gets 
my goat with the tax bill that was 
passed before I got here. Because ac-
cording to the International Monetary 
Fund, only one-fifth of the tax gains to 
businesses were directed toward capital 
and R&D expenditures, so we are not 
seeing that investment going to the 
new technologies that will create the 
new jobs, that will employ more peo-
ple. 
We know it is exciting. We know it is 
there. We know if we gave every mu-
nicipality in this country the oppor-
tunity to recycle to their full poten-
tial, to reduce, reuse, reuse those mate-
rials, we would not only gain back 
those materials that we have sourced, 
but we would have new jobs as a result 
of that. 
Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the 
jobs and as we look at the skills that 
our employers are looking for, that we 
are training for in this year 2020, in 
this new decade, some reference that 
we are in this fourth industrial revolu-
tion of which I am a champion. 
This is where I came out of before I 
was in this body. I was working in the 
industrial Internet of Things space, 
collaborating with nonprofits and uni-
versities and community colleges and 
local school districts, like my good 
friends in Novi Community School Dis-
trict. 
We had a lot of fun and we are identi-
fying those skills. We have identified 
them. We codified the job roles: tech-
nology and computer skills; digital 
skills; an understanding of the ones 
and zeros; programming skills for ro-
bots and automation. 
b 1915 
These are things that have great 
meaning to those of us in Michigan’s 
11th District because I am home to the 
company that has the largest robot, 
with FANUC in the world in Rochester 
Hills/Auburn Hills. 
It is really quite exciting, working 
with tools and different techniques, dif-
ferent technical skills and critical 
thinking.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H60 
January 8, 2020 
These are things that don’t know 
partisan lines, by the way. These are 
things that make you stand up and say: 
I am going to be a champion for this, 
addressing the root pain that is seeping 
into our economy. 
These are realities. Last year, Michi-
gan lost 6,200 factory jobs, yet we are 
creating and innovating at exponential 
rates. We decided to go it alone with 
tariffs, and we are paying the price. We 
are being squeezed. 
I believe we can all work together to 
solve this. I am not being a naysayer 
because we all know we need to hold 
China accountable. This is something 
that has been a project of mine 
throughout my career, which is how to 
take on the bad actors with the illegal 
dumping, the currency manipulation, 
the stealing of our patents, and the un-
fair playing field that affects our work-
force. 
We still know that we value Amer-
ican work and that we value the crafts-
manship and what goes into making a 
regional economy like mine hum in 
really exciting and exponential ways. 
We understand that, and we recognize 
that we can come together in meaning-
ful ways. 
We also continue to call on the Sen-
ate to pass the bills that we have sent 
forward, the many bipartisan bills, the 
very bipartisan Butch Lewis Act, to 
protect the pensions of our hard-
working Americans, those who did ev-
erything right and are still waiting. 
I have not forgotten in 2020 that we 
are still working to get that deal done. 
We are still working to increase the 
wage. This is something in Michigan 
that we voted on, to increase the min-
imum wage, to raise the wage. One job 
should be enough. Your valued work 
should be enough. 
We are not seeking to overregulate 
and get rid of good deals, but what we 
are looking to do, Mr. Speaker, is to 
stand up for individual, hardworking 
Americans, those who are counting on 
us. It is incumbent upon us. 
We sit in this body of 435 individuals. 
They increased that number the last 
time in 1913. Many, many years later, 
the population has grown. 
History is important, my friends. I 
encourage you to read your history. I 
encourage you to learn the facts and 
figures of our past and embrace how 
that has changed our future. We are in 
some trying times. 
We closed out 2019 in this session of 
Congress with some things that I was 
very proud of. I got my first bill signed 
into law, the Building Blocks of STEM 
Act—bipartisan and bicameral—signed 
by the President on December 24, I be-
lieve it was, a bill that will support in-
vestments in early childhood edu-
cation. I want all of my Michiganders 
lining up for this. It is the National 
Science Foundation. We get a lot of 
NSF dollars, millions, in Michigan. 
The investment in early childhood 
education, Mr. Speaker, is priceless. 
That continuity for those jobs in the 
future is how we get in front of the 
skills gap. That is how we start ad-
dressing some of the rumblings in our 
regional economy. 
We also, though, recognize that the 
headlines that we have embraced in 
this new year and in this new session of 
Congress have many Americans con-
cerned. Many individuals are asking: 
What is going to happen? What is tak-
ing place in the Middle East? What 
does this mean for my family? 
Constituents say to me: ‘‘I have teen-
age sons. Are they going to be draft-
ed?’’ We take that responsibility that 
the Congress is charged with very seri-
ously. 
Mr. Speaker, I look to this, which is 
that President Barack Obama gave us 
the words that change will not come if 
we wait for some other person or some 
other time. He said: ‘‘We are the ones 
we have been waiting for. We are the 
change we seek.’’ 
That is what our House majority is 
about. That is what our For the People 
agenda is representing. That is what 
we are taking up this week when we 
say no to war, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
RECESS

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

Small 
Businesses Act of 2019, as amended, 
would have no significant effect on the 
deficit, and therefore, the budgetary ef-

S63 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 8, 2020 
No. 4 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord, the giver of grace, in 
these turbulent and tempestuous times 
when we do not know what a day may 
bring, You continue to be sovereign. 
Morning after morning, we continue to 
receive Your new mercies. 
Lord, sustain our lawmakers with 
Your unfailing love that is as high as 
the heavens. May our Senators know 
that, in everything, You continue to 
work for the good of those who love 
You and who are called according to 
Your purpose for them. Pour out upon 
our legislators the riches of Your 
mercy so that they may stay steadfast 
in faith. 
Eternal God, hear us as we pray. We 
need stronger hearts, greater faith, and 
clearer perception. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FEDERALIST 62 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there 
is a story that we often hear about in 
high school and government classes 
where George Washington is said to 
have told Jefferson that the Senate 
was created to ‘‘cool’’ House legislation 
as a saucer is used to cool hot tea. 
Whether that is historically accurate 
or not, it is a good summation of the 
role of the U.S. Senate. Now I am going 
to quote from Federalist 62 what Madi-
son said. He could have made this 
quote a little easier to understand, but 
here it is anyway: ‘‘The necessity of a 
senate is not less indicated by the pro-
pensity of all single and numerous as-
semblies to yield to the impulse of sud-
den and violent passions, and to be se-
duced by factious leaders into intem-
perate and pernicious resolutions.’’ 
That is the end of Madison’s quote, 
Federalist 62. 
Now, considering Madison’s admoni-
tion, it should be no surprise to anyone 
whatsoever that the Senate passes 
fewer bills than the House and always 
has. But how come those who parrot 
the partisan talking points that the 
Senate is a legislative graveyard don’t 
also talk about the over 200 Senate 
bills on Speaker PELOSI’s desk? 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
had planned to discuss the corrosive 
political games that the Speaker of the 
House continues to play with the sol-
emn issue of Presidential impeach-
ment, but the deadly serious events of 
yesterday evening threw those political 
squabbles into the starkest possible re-
lief. 
I was troubled but not surprised by 
reports that Iran fired ballistic mis-
siles at U.S. forces in Iraq last night. 
As I have warned, the threat posed by 
Iraq has been growing for years, and 
this threat will continue even beyond 
the death of Tehran’s master terrorist, 
Soleimani. 
We must remain vigilant in the face 
of serious threats posed by Tehran. Ap-
parently, these strikes did not kill or 
wound 
Americans, 
but 
they 
dem-
onstrate the significant progress Iran 
has made over the last decade in build-
ing a large, long-range, and accurate 
ballistic missile force. Many of us have 
long cited the absence of any con-
straint on Iran’s sophisticated missile 
program as one of the primary short-
comings of the Obama Iran deal, and 
this strike stands as a reminder to the 
world of this growing threat. 
We rightly talk a lot in this Chamber 
about American interests, but last 
night was another stark reminder that 
Iran and its proxies have been a cancer 
on Iraq’s sovereignty and Iraq’s poli-
tics for some time. 
Tehran has long shown disregard for 
Iraqi lives. Just in the last few weeks, 
its militia proxies have slaughtered in-
nocent Iraqi protesters, and it has 
launched ballistic missiles at its terri-
tory. The millions of Iraqis who have 
been taking to the streets for months 
to protest have understood this per-
fectly well. 
I spoke to the President last night. I 
am grateful for his patience and pru-
dence as he and his Cabinet deliberate 
on how to respond appropriately to the 
latest Iranian provocation. As a super-
power, we have the capacity to exercise 
restraint and to respond at a time and 
place of our choosing, if need be. I be-
lieve the President wants to avoid con-
flict or needless loss of life but is right-
ly prepared to protect American lives 
and interests. I hope Iran’s leaders do 
not miscalculate by questioning our 
collective will and launching further 
attacks. For our part, I certainly hope 
our own congressional deliberations do 
not give Tehran a reason to question 
our national will. 
Top officials will provide a classified 
briefing to Senators today. As I have

said before, I hope all Senators will 
wait for the facts before they pass 
judgment on the recent strike on 
Soleimani. Patience, caution, and re-
straint can sometimes be in short sup-
ply around here, but when matters of 
national security are at hand, it is im-
perative that we seek out the facts, re-
strain our partisan urges, and con-
centrate on protecting our country. 
For this reason, it has troubled me 
that Speaker PELOSI responded to the 
earliest reports yesterday by leaping to 
blame ‘‘needless provocations’’ by our 
administration. In other words, she 
was blaming the United States. 
So let’s be clear. We can and should 
debate how to responsibly respond to 
Iranian threats, but the notion that 
our administration is to blame for Ira-
nian 
aggression—that 
is 
nonsense. 
Utter nonsense. 
For 40 years since the founding of the 
Islamic Republic, Iran has consistently 
pursued aggression against the United 
States, against Israel, and against its 
Arab neighbors. The question before us 
is not who is to blame for the aggres-
sion. It is how best to deter and defend 
against it. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I do 
need to say a few words about the other 
serious matter occupying the Congress. 
Late last year, Speaker PELOSI and 
House 
Democrats 
sped 
through 
a 
slapdash impeachment of President 
Trump in 12 weeks because they in-
sisted the need to undo the 2016 elec-
tion was urgent—urgent, they said. 
Since then, the same people have 
spent 3 weeks dragging their heels and 
refusing to proceed to a Senate trial. 
Supposedly, the explanation for this 
shameless game playing is that Speak-
er PELOSI wanted leverage—leverage— 
to reach into the Senate and dictate 
our trial proceedings to us. 
I have made clear from the beginning 
that no such leverage exists. It is non-
existent. Yesterday, we made it clear it 
will never exist. A majority of the Sen-
ate has decided that the first phase of 
an impeachment trial should track 
closely with the unanimous bipartisan 
precedent that all 100 Senators sup-
ported for the first phase of the Clinton 
trial back in 1999. There will be no hag-
gling with the House over Senate pro-
cedure. We will not cede our authority 
to try this impeachment. The House 
Democrats’ turn is over. The Senate 
has made its decision. 
The 1999 precedent does not guar-
antee witnesses or foreclose witnesses. 
Let me say that again. It neither guar-
antees witnesses nor forecloses wit-
nesses. It leaves those determinations 
until later in the trial, where they be-
long. I fully expect the parties will 
raise questions of witnesses at the ap-
propriate time. 
I would remind my friends on the 
other side that I strongly suspect that 
not all of the potential witnesses would 
be people the Democrats are eager to 
hear from. The Senate will address all 
of these questions at the appropriate 
time, and that is for the Senate and 
the Senate only to decide, period. 
Now even fellow Democrats are ex-
pressing 
public 
concern 
over 
the 
Speaker’s endless appetite for these 
cynical games. Here is what the senior 
Senator from Connecticut told the 
press yesterday. He said: ‘‘I think the 
time has passed. She should send the 
articles over.’’ And the senior Senator 
from West Virginia said: ‘‘I think it 
needs to start; I really do.’’ And the 
junior Senator from Maine said: ‘‘I 
think it is time for the Speaker to send 
the articles over.’’ 
My Democratic friends are losing pa-
tience, just as the American people are 
losing patience. The country knows 
this absurdity should not go on. So 
what do the American people say? 
A recent Harvard-Harris poll found 
that 58 percent of Americans believe 
Speaker PELOSI should send the arti-
cles to the Senate, not continue hold-
ing them up. Let me say that again. 
This is a Harvard poll. It found that 58 
percent of Americans believe Speaker 
PELOSI should send the articles to the 
Senate, not continue holding them up. 
In the same survey, 77 percent believe 
Democrats need to accept the same 
structure as the Clinton trial rather 
than hold out for special new rules. So 
we are beginning to hear from the 
American people how they view this 
standoff. 
We all know that Senators have a di-
versity of opinions about President 
Trump, about the House inquiry, and 
about the optimal structure for a trial. 
But notwithstanding all of this, no 
Senator—no Senator—should want the 
House of Representatives to steamroll 
institutional norms and dictate our 
business to us. 
Haven’t enough toxic new precedents 
been set in recent months? Hasn’t the 
House broken enough constitutional 
china already? 
This is not about the current Speak-
er and the current President. Do my 
colleagues believe this is what a future 
Democratic President would deserve? 
Do they believe it is good for the coun-
try? 
There is a reason the Constitution 
reads the way it does. The House has 
the sole power of impeachment. They 
have exercised it. It is the Senate to 
whom the Founders gave the sole 
power to try all impeachments, end of 
story. 
Yet, even as her fellow Democrats 
are jumping ship, the Speaker is trying 
to double down. Yesterday evening, in 
the midst of these deadly serious 
events, Speaker PELOSI put out yet an-
other statement saying that she has no 
intention to end her political game 
playing. At the very same time that a 
global crisis was unfolding in realtime, 
she published yet another ‘‘Dear Col-
league’’ letter saying that she intends 
to keep our Commander in Chief in this 
limbo indefinitely. 
I am glad Democratic Senators are 
losing patience with this. I would urge 
my friend the Democratic leader to lis-
ten to his own Members. My distin-
guished colleague from New York, as 
the minority leader in the U.S. Senate, 
is a senior Member of an independent 
branch of our bicameral legislature. 
The Senate is not a creature of the 
House. The Democratic leader does not 
need to continue to be in thrall to the 
Speaker. He does not need to keep 
colluding with outside efforts to sup-
plant the judgment of his own col-
leagues. Stand up for the Senate. Stand 
up for our institutions. Stand up for 
the country.

it appears that there have been no cas-
ualties.

profes-
sionalism and bravery of our service-
members and other personnel in harm’s 
way. 
While we are thankful that there 
were no casualties and we are thankful 
for the safety of American forces and 
personnel in the region, I condemn the 
attack by the Iranian Government and 
remain concerned about the risk of fur-
ther escalation of hostilities in the 
Middle East. Now, more than ever, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S65 
January 8, 2020 
United States must be clear-headed 
and sure-footed about what comes 
next. The American people do not want 
a war with Iran, and the President does 
not have the authority to wage one. 
Yesterday, we learned that the Presi-
dent had ordered the deployment of at 
least as many as 4,500 soldiers to the 
region—potentially more. Beyond Iraq, 
the U.S. military now has more than 
70,000 troops in the Middle East, from 
Kuwait to Qatar, to Afghanistan, to 
the UAE, to Saudi Arabia, to Jordan, 
Oman, and Bahrain. 
The President has promised to get 
the United States out of these forever 
wars in the Middle East, but the arrow 
is headed in the wrong direction. 
Mr. President, how many more is it 
going to be? How long will they remain 
abroad? What is their objective? How 
will we assure their safety? Will more 
be deployed in the weeks and months 
ahead? 
These are urgent questions. The ad-
ministration must answer them. But so 
far, there has been a profound lack of 
information provided to Congress from 
the Department of Defense concerning 
what the Department is doing in re-
sponse to Iran. 
So I join Senators REED and DURBIN 
in requesting regular briefings and doc-
uments from the administration detail-
ing the number of troops the President 
has deployed and plans to deploy in 
support of contingency plans with re-
spect to Iran. We need to know if the 
administration is committing addi-
tional troops to the region and for how 
long. 
Our letter urges the administration 
to clarify to the American people and 
our military that international law 
prohibits the deliberate targeting of 
cultural sites and that such an order 
would be unlawful and should not be 
followed. 
The 
American 
people, 
rightfully, 
have serious concerns about a war with 
Iran and whether we are safer today be-
cause of this President’s foreign policy, 
which is so often impulsive and erratic. 
I am afraid these impulsive and erratic 
actions throughout the world are mak-
ing us less safe. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. President, now, on impeachment, 
yesterday, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
an-
nounced that he has the votes to pass a 
partisan resolution to set the rules for 
the impeachment trial of President 
Trump. It was another unfortunate 
confirmation that Leader MCCONNELL 
has no intention of working with the 
minority to establish rules of a fair and 
honest trial that examines the evi-
dence, hears from witnesses, and re-
ceives the relevant documents. 
I have asked Leader MCCONNELL re-
peatedly to sit down and negotiate a 
plan where we would have witnesses 
and documents, and he has refused. In-
stead, Leader MCCONNELL, by his own 
admission, took his cues from the 
White House when it came to setting 
the parameters of a trial. Rather than 
engaging in any serious negotiation 
with the Senate minority, he only 
spent time trying to convince his cau-
cus that we should punt the questions 
of witnesses and documents to a later 
date. 
I have explained why this proposal 
makes very little sense from the per-
spective of having a fair trial. The evi-
dence should inform arguments in a 
trial. Evidence should not be an after-
thought. Why would it make sense for 
both sides to present their entire case 
and then decide whether the Senate 
should request the evidence that we al-
ready know is out there? 
It is extremely telling that Leader 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
are not willing to take a forthright po-
sition on whether we should call wit-
nesses and request documents. They 
can only say that the issue should be 
addressed later. Their only refuge—not 
much of one—is to kick the can down 
the road. No one—no one—has ad-
vanced an argument as to why the four 
eyewitnesses we have proposed should 
not testify. No one has advanced an ar-
gument as to why the three specific 
sets of documents related to the 
charges against the President should 
not be provided. Republicans can only 
get behind kicking the can down the 
road because they know we have the 
full weight of the argument on our 
side. There is virtually no argument 
why we shouldn’t have witnesses and 
why we shouldn’t have documents. 
I want to make one thing very clear: 
There will be votes—repeated votes—on 
the question of witnesses and docu-
ments at the trial. The initial votes 
will not be the last votes on the mat-
ter. Republicans can delay it, but they 
cannot avoid it. And when those votes 
come 
up, 
Senate 
Republicans—not 
Leader MCCONNELL, who has already 
cast his lot completely with the de-
fendant, the President—will have two 
crucial things to worry about. 
First, if the Senate runs a sham trial 
without witnesses, without documents, 
and without all of facts, then the Presi-
dent’s acquittal at the end of the trial 
will be meaningless. A trial without all 
the facts is a farce. The verdicts of 
kangaroo courts are empty. 
Leader MCCONNELL is fond of claim-
ing that the House ran the ‘‘most 
rushed, least thorough, and most un-
fair impeachment inquiry in modern 
history.’’ I know that is his talking 
point, but, in truth, Leader MCCONNELL 
is plotting to run the most rushed, 
least thorough, and most unfair im-
peachment trial in modern history. If 
the Senate rushes through the Presi-
dent’s impeachment, if we actually fail 
to try the case, as the Constitution de-
mands, then the true acquittal the 
President craves will be unobtainable. 
The American people will see right 
through a partisan trial and under-
stand that a rush to judgment renders 
that moot. They will understand that, 
when you don’t want witnesses and 
documents, you are afraid of the truth 
and that you are covering something 
up, and that the likelihood is strong 
that you did something very wrong. 
That is common sense. That is what all 
the polling data shows most Americans 
believe. 
Second, when the Senate has votes 
on witnesses and documents, my Re-
publican colleagues will have to answer 
to not just the President. The Amer-
ican people do not want a coverup. 
Whatever their view of the President, 
the American people want the Senate 
to have a fair trial. All the data shows 
that, with two more polls in the last 
few days. Every Senator will be under 
massive public pressure to support a 
fair trial that examines all the facts. 
The American people understand the 
gravity of the charges against the 
President. The House has impeached 
the President for using the powers of 
his public office to benefit himself. The 
President was impeached because the 
House believes he tried to shake down 
a foreign leader into investigating his 
political opponent, pressuring a foreign 
power to interfere in our elections. He 
was impeached because he undertook 
an unprecedented campaign of obstruc-
tion to prevent Congress from inves-
tigating his wrongdoing. 
The Articles of Impeachment suggest 
the President committed a grave in-
jury to our democracy. The conduct 
they describe is exactly what the 
Founders most feared when they forged 
the impeachment powers of Congress. 
If the Senate fails to hold a fair hear-
ing of those charges, if one party—the 
President’s 
party—decides 
to 
rush 
through a trial without hearing all the 
facts, witnesses, and documents, it will 
not just be the verdict of history that 
falls heavy on their shoulders. The 
American people, in the here and now, 
will pass a harsh judgment on Senators 
who participate in a coverup for the 
President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
IRAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
night Iran fired more than a dozen bal-
listic missiles at two military bases in 
Iraq 
where 
American 
troops 
were 
based. It was a brazen escalation with 
dangerous implications for the United 
States and the world. 
We are fortunate. As of today, at this 
moment, none of our personnel have 
been reported to have been harmed, but 
the outrageous act was a clear and 
unsurprising retaliation to President 
Trump’s killing of Iranian General 
Soleimani. 
Our first order of business must be 
the safety of our military and civilian 
personnel in Iraq and the region, and I 
call on the Trump administration to 
make that the highest priority. An-
other immediate requirement is that 
the Congress step up and play one of 
the most important and long-neglected 
constitutional roles that we can envi-
sion. Article I, section 8, of the U.S. 
Constitution is clear in stating that 
the power to declare war is an explicit 
authority and power of Congress, as it

should be. One should never send our 
sons and daughters into conflict with-
out the knowledge and consent of the 
American people. Our Founding Fa-
thers were wise in making sure that 
this awesome power did not rest with a 
King-like leader but with the people’s 
elected representatives. I have made 
this 
same 
argument 
regardless 
of 
whether the occupant of the White 
House was a Democrat or a Republican. 
Some have had the audacity to argue 
that the 2001 authorization for the use 
of military force approved by this Con-
gress to respond to the September 11, 
2001, attacks or the 2002 AUMF, the war 
with Iraq, apply to the situation today 
in Iran. That is clearly wrong. 
Let me be clear. I cannot imagine 
that anyone—anyone—who took either 
of those votes nearly 20 years ago—and 
I was here at that time—thought that 
they were approving a war with Iran 
two decades later. I certainly didn’t. 
This Congress should not be a trou-
bling 
rubberstamp 
for 
President 
Trump’s worst instincts by marching 
into another war in the Middle East. 
Simply, it is time for Members of this 
important body to show some courage 
and do their constitutional jobs. If you 
want a war with Iran, step up and face 
your constituents and record your vote 
accordingly. 
The War Powers Resolution I filed 
last week, with the leadership of Sen-
ator TIM KAINE of Virginia, will be a 
first step regarding Congress’s role in 
any conflict with Iran but not a last 
step. Ultimately, this President cannot 
start a war with Iran without the ap-
proval, under the Constitution, of Con-
gress, and the Republican leadership 
should not roll over and play the role 
of lapdog when it comes to such a seri-
ous, life-and-death matter. 
Tragically, 
this 
escalation 
with 
Iran—and the heightened risk to our 
personnel and security interests—was 
entirely predictable, except, it appears, 
to President Trump and Secretary 
Pompeo. The question was never the 
simplistic canard over whether killing 
Soleimani, a genuinely loathsome ter-
rorist actor, was warranted or not, but, 
clearly, whether taking him off the 
face of the Earth was in the best inter-
est of the United States. 
Would such an act really advance the 
cause and interest and policies of our 
country or precipitate another war in 
the Middle East? The answer is increas-
ingly upon us, and we here must debate 
this crisis before President Trump 
drags us even closer to this precipice. 
Mr. 
President, 
sadly, 
President 
Trump’s erratic and incoherent policies 
toward Iran have greatly contributed 
to the current crisis. 
Before taking office, Iran’s nuclear 
weapons program was halted in a his-
toric agreement President Obama ne-
gotiated in cooperation with our Euro-
pean allies, China, and Russia. 
Iran continued its malign behaviors 
in the region, but containing them was 
much easier without the threat of a nu-
clear bomb. 
President Trump petulantly with-
drew from the nuclear agreement and 
tried to starve Iran of benefits it was 
to receive from that deal. 
He pursued an incomprehensible er-
ratic policy of regime change by trying 
to flatter and meet with Iranian Presi-
dent Rouhani to negotiate a supposedly 
better deal . . . threating Iran mili-
tarily . . . and tightening sanctions. 
Those efforts were going nowhere. 
Iran was lashing out at American in-
terests, we were alienated from our key 
allies, and Iran inched closer to re-
starting its nuclear program. 
And in just the last week alone, 
President Trump’s impulsive actions 
managed to reverse the recent Iraqi 
protest sentiment that wanted Iran to 
stop meddling in its politics, leading 
instead to a vote this weekend in the 
Iraqi parliament to expel all U.S. 
forces. 
Similarly, after months of anti-gov-
ernment protests in Iran, he almost in-
stantaneously united Iranian public 
opinion in hostility toward the U.S. 
Iran now announced it is restarting 
its nuclear program and our interests 
around the region are on high alert and 
are at risk from further Iranian attack 
for considerable time to come. 
Tragically, all President Trump has 
to show for his foolish, quote, ‘‘max-
imum pressure’’ campaign is an en-
flamed region, attacks on our per-
sonnel, the U.S. military potentially 
being evicted from Iraq, greater U.S. 
troop deployments to the Middle East, 
and an America less safe and on the 
brink of war. 
Most certainly not ‘‘all is well.’’ 
Have we learned nothing from the 
thousands of lost lives and injuries and 
trillions of dollars spent on the war in 
Iraq—a war sold to this country on 
false pretenses? 
Are we going to be led to yet such an-
other fiasco by some of the same voices 
around President Trump who have yet 
to account for their failures in their 
disastrous war in Iraq? 
Will my Republican colleagues fi-
nally show some backbone to an un-
checked, uninformed, and untrusted 
President about to bumble into an-
other war in the Middle East? 
For the sakes of the sons and daugh-
ters who would be sent to any war with 
Iran, I certainly hope so. 
I see that my colleague from Illinois 
is here and has asked for permission to 
speak on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL GEORGE DESOMBRE 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
am here to speak on two matters. 
The first is the nomination for Am-
bassador to the Kingdom of Thailand of 
Michael DeSombre. The Kingdom of 
Thailand has been a longtime U.S. ally 
and is a key partner for our efforts in 
the Southeast Asia region, both eco-
nomically and militarily. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
nominee 
has 
failed to reach out to either me or my 
colleague and my senior Senator, DICK 
DURBIN, both of whom are his home- 
State Senators. He has not reached out 
to me. So I am asking my colleagues to 
please vote no on cloture on Michael 
DeSombre to be our Ambassador to the 
Kingdom of Thailand until such time 
as I am able to have a chance to sit 
down with him. 
IRAN 
Mr. President, now I would like to 
speak on the attacks from Iran. 
‘‘All is well.’’ That is what Donald 
Trump said just hours after a dozen 
missiles were fired at two U.S. military 
bases last night. That is what he said 
as thousands of troops are readying to 
deploy to the Middle East, to a hotbed 
of anger, where wearing an American 
flag on your shoulder gets more dan-
gerous by the day. That is what he said 
as his own Nation careens toward a 
reckless and unauthorized war of his 
own making, born out of his illiteracy 
in matters ranging from foreign policy 
to common sense. 
Donald Trump never deigned to put 
on the uniform of this great Nation, 
using his father’s money to buy his 
way out of military service when his 
country needed him in Vietnam. 
Let me make something clear to 
Donald Trump. All is certainly not well 
when war is on the horizon, just be-
cause you want to look like the tough-
est kid on the playground. I am incred-
ibly thankful that no Americans were 
killed last night in Iran’s rebuttal at-
tack, but some missed missiles should 
be no cause for celebration for the 
President. Just because there weren’t 
fatalities yesterday doesn’t mean there 
will not be any tragedies tomorrow. 
We got into this situation because of 
Trump’s glibness, because he liked the 
feeling of thumping his chest and the 
roar it got from FOX News, because he 
was so enamored by maximum pressure 
that he laughed at the idea of even 
minimum diplomacy. Now America is 
less safe as a result. So, no, Mr. Presi-
dent, all is certainly not well. 
Sadly, Trump’s glibness is shocking 
but not surprising. Last weekend, he 
was at his golf course in Florida, while 
more and more American troops were 
packing their rucks and getting ready

tweeting from Mar-a-Lago while the 
Iraqi Parliament was voting to expel 
U.S. servicemembers from their nation. 
He was rubbing shoulders with fellow 
millionaires from the comfort of his

coalition against ISIS was announcing 
that we no longer have the resources to 
fight ISIS in Iraq and that, instead, we 
have to hunker down and focus on pro-
tecting our troops from the acts of re-
venge that Iran has promised are on 
the way. 
A potential global conflict is veering 
closer by the hour, and it is because of 
Donald Trump. It is because of his im-
petuousness and his ignorance. It is be-
cause, once again, he has been manipu-
lated by a hostile regime into decisions 
that further their goals while endan-
gering the security of the Nation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S67 
January 8, 2020 
Trump is actually supposed to be lead-
ing. 
When I deployed to Iraq in 2004, I saw 
firsthand just how eager the country 
was to shake off Iran’s influence. I 
watched as the anti-Iran protests con-
tinued long after I flew my last mis-
sion, as young Iraqis spoke out against 
Iran while I was back in Baghdad just 
this past spring, as protests roiled as 
recently as last month, when tens of 
thousands of Iraqis flooded the streets, 
raising voices and picket signs, de-
manding that their government crawl 
out from under Tehran’s thumb. 
Now, after Donald Trump decided to 
kill Major General Qasem Soleimani on 
sovereign Baghdad soil, those same 
streets are now filled with protesters 
once more. Yet, this time, they are 
marching in solidarity with the enemy 
that hundreds of Iraqis died marching 
against just a few short weeks ago. 
With 
one 
choice, 
Donald 
Trump 
squandered the opportunity that ex-
isted to push against Iranian influence 
and for greater democracy and sta-
bility in the Middle East. In one fell 
swoop, 
he 
somehow 
managed 
to 
villainize the United States and vic-
timize Iran, our enemy, isolating us 
from a long-term partner in Iraq and 
amping up Iran’s influence in a country 
that everyone knows is vital to our se-
curity interests throughout the Middle 
East. 
Look, Iran didn’t want Trump to kill 
Soleimani, but they were hungry for 
all that has happened as a result. They 
were starving to go on the offensive, 
desperate to change the narrative, to 
swing public opinion and solidify their 
power in Iraq, to have a new excuse to 
attack anyone with an American flag 
on their shoulder and to shrug off the 
restraints of the nuclear deal. 
Like a pawn in a game of chess he 
didn’t even seem to know he was play-
ing, Trump was baited into handing 
them all of that. Like a child who is 
blind to consequences, ignorant of his 
own ignorance, he has given Iran ev-
erything they could have asked for in 
the end, making it far more likely that 
tomorrow—or 
next 
week 
or 
next 
month—more Americans will be sent 
into another one of the forever wars he 
has bragged that he, and he alone, 
would be able to end. 
We used to have the Monroe Doctrine 
and the Truman doctrine. Now we have 
the Trump doctrine, in which the lead-
er of the free world, the Commander in 
Chief of the greatest fighting force ever 
assembled, gets manipulated again and 
again by dictators of hostile regimes. 
We have already seen it too many 
times since he was sworn into office. 
We have seen it played out on the 
streets of Venezuela and the deserts of 
northeast Syria. We have seen him get 
manipulated by tyrants in Pyongyang 
and Riyadh, subjugated by despots in 
Moscow and Ankara, as our allies 
laughed—literally laughed—at him be-
hind his back. 
All these dictators and hostile re-
gimes know. They have realized the 
same thing: The President of the 
United States is as easy to control as a 
toddler. Sweet-talk him or thump your 
chest and issue a few schoolyard 
threats and you have got him. He will 
fall for it every time, doing your bid-
ding as if it is his own. I wish this 
weren’t true, but my diaper-wearing, 
20-month-old daughter has better im-
pulse control than this President. Kids 
in school cafeterias know not to look 
up when someone tells them that ‘‘gul-
lible’’ is written on the ceiling, but I 
am pretty sure Donald Trump, a man 
who once stared directly into a solar 
eclipse, will be caught stealing a 
glance, just to be sure. 
The thing is, Trump told us who he 
was long before he stepped into the 
Oval Office, and too many chose not to 
believe him. As a so-called business-
man, he left a string of bankruptcies 
wherever he went, destroying both his 
own companies and the small busi-
nesses unlucky enough to be caught in 
his wake. 
Now, though, as Commander in Chief, 
his incompetence has cost us our 
standing in the world, endangered our 
national security, and placed an even 
bigger target on our deployed troops. 
Now, the currency that he is spending 
isn’t just the money that his father left 
him but the blood of the men and 
women who have sworn an oath to de-
fend this Nation to their deaths. 
Sixteen years ago, I was one of the 
many Americans deployed to Iraq, one 
of the many who was willing to sac-
rifice everything, after our Commander 
in Chief convinced Congress that our 
Nation’s security depended on remov-
ing Saddam Hussein and replacing his 
regime with a democracy. A decade and 
a half later, we have spent trillions of 
dollars to achieve that goal. Hundreds 
of thousands of Iraqi citizens have been 
killed or displaced. Thousands of our 
bravest have died for that goal. Thou-
sands more have been wounded and 
maimed. 
We did not sacrifice all of that for 
this President to turn our Iraqi part-
ners into adversaries who vote to kick 
us out of the very democracy we helped 
to build. 
I have friends who have done 8, 9, 10 
tours in Iraq, who go each time know-
ing they will probably be back on that 
same stretch of sand in a couple of 
years, who proudly answer the call and 
who will continue to answer the call, 
fighting for that same patch of desert 
over and over again because they be-
lieve—they believe—us when we tell 
them that will make America safer and 
more secure. They gain a few feet one 
tour, lose an inch or two the next, 
watching their buddies lose limbs or 
lives over that same piece of ground 
time and again. 
Those troops show up ready to do 
their jobs whenever we ask, no matter 
what. We need to honor that. We need 
to honor their willingness to show up 
and carry out the mission. Now, espe-
cially after the attacks last night, we 
in Congress can honor them by doing 
our job. We are the branch vested with 
that most solemn duty of declaring 
war, so we need to exert our constitu-
tional control over this out-of-control 
toddler-in-chief and vote to prevent 
him from entangling us in another 
major war without legal authorization 
from Congress. In this moment, at this 
precipice, we need to be doing whatever 
we can to break the cycle of escalation. 
We need less chest-thumping and more 
diplomacy. 
Don’t get me wrong—I am glad this 
general is dead. He was responsible for 
the deaths of hundreds of American 
servicemembers over the last decades. I 
also want to stop Iranian influence, but 
this decision by this President has not 
done that. 
If we truly want to honor our heroes 
in uniform, we wouldn’t send them into 
harm’s way without a clear-eyed dis-
cussion of the mission we are asking 
them to carry out and the con-
sequences for both them and our Na-
tion. Then, after we have that discus-
sion, if we still believe war is the right 
path, I will vote yes. But so far, Trump 
has not even managed to come to us to 
give us his reasons for his actions. Hav-
ing never sacrificed much himself, he 
doesn’t understand our troops’ sac-
rifices. Having never really served any-
thing other than his own self-interests, 
he doesn’t give a second thought to 
their service, treating their dedication 
to our Nation with the kind of reckless 
abandon he did the cash he blew 
through with each of his bankruptcies. 
I don’t need to remind anyone that 
Donald Trump is a five-deferment draft 
dodger. But his ignorance about mili-
tary service isn’t captured just by the 
privilege he showed when he dodged 
service in Vietnam—no, it is also re-
vealed in his brazen embrace of tor-
ture, his hostility toward good order 
and discipline, and his stated desire to 
commit war crimes. 
I implore my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to recognize our Com-
mander in Chief for who he really is. 
Donald Trump will never willingly cut 
the puppet strings that the likes of 
Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are 
using to make him dance. We need a 
strong majority in the Senate to force 
such an action, to discuss the AUMF. 
Until then, small-time dictators will 
continue to have access to the world’s 
most powerful marionette, and we will 
all suffer the consequences. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me 
say that I, along with I think most 
Americans, am grateful that in the 
rocket attacks launched last night by 
Iran, there were no American casual-
ties. I think I, like most of our col-
leagues here in the Senate, I hope, will 
have an opportunity later today to 
hear from the administration about the 
state of events there and what the 
plans are going forward. 
We all know it is a dangerous part of 
the world. It has been that way for dec-
ades. The Iranian influence there is a

malign influence that has put at risk 
and in jeopardy not only American 
lives but lives of countless people 
throughout that region. 
Mr. Soleimani, who was removed in 
the last few days, of course, was re-
sponsible for hundreds of American 
deaths. His loss is something that I 
think people not only in this country 
but certainly people in that region of 
the world benefit from because he will 
no longer be able to conduct and oper-
ate and commit terrorist attacks and 
bring about death to people all over 
that region of the world. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. President, I would also like to 
point out, as I think most know, and 
most of the reporting has reflected 
this, that Republicans in the Senate— 
and yesterday Leader MCCONNELL made 
the statement—are prepared to take up 
the Articles of Impeachment when they 
are delivered to us by the House of 
Representatives. For whatever rea-
son—and it appears that the House 
Democrats under Speaker PELOSI have 
determined that it is to their political 
advantage for some reason to hang on 
to those articles and to perhaps game 
this out a little bit. We, of course, 
don’t know what that gains them. But 
in any event, they have not yet, after 
now several weeks, decided to proceed 
and to bring those over here to the 
Senate. 
I would point out that it can’t be be-
cause there isn’t a process in place to 
deal with those articles when they ar-
rive. Obviously, what Republicans in 
the Senate have agreed to adopt is the 
Clinton precedent—in other words, the 
precedent that was used when Presi-
dent Clinton went through impeach-
ment 21 years ago. At that time, it was 
good enough for all of the Democrats in 
the U.S. Senate—by a vote of 100 to 0, 
a unanimous vote in the U.S. Senate— 
to proceed to those articles. 
All Senate Republicans are simply 
saying is that is a good precedent. It 
was good enough for Democrats and 
Republicans back then, and it ought to 
be good enough for Republicans and 
Democrats today. 
What that simply provides for is to 
allow both sides—the managers in the 
House to come over and make their ar-
gument; the President and his team to 
be able to put up their defense; Sen-
ators to have an opportunity to listen 
to those arguments and then to pro-
pound questions, to ask questions 
through the Chair that could be re-
sponded to, and then, at that time, to 
determine whether additional informa-
tion, evidence, witnesses, et cetera, 
could be brought forward. But as a very 
straightforward process—one, as I said, 
that met with the approval of all 100 
Senators, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, back in 1999—the Clinton prece-
dent seems to me, at least, to be a fair 
way in which to proceed and one that 
Senate Republicans have agreed to 
move forward with. 
If and when the House Democrats 
under Speaker PELOSI determine they 
are ready to send those articles over 
here—it seems like maybe they are 
waiting for something to rescue what I 
think is an otherwise fairly weak argu-
ment they have to make, but when 
those articles arrive here, we will have 
a process in place in which to move for-
ward and get this trial underway in the 
Senate and hopefully hear the argu-
ments and at some point—I hope in the 
not too distant future—conclude this 
and get it behind us and move on to the 
work the American people sent us here 
to do. 
Obviously, there is an election com-
ing up in November. The first votes 
will start being cast just a few weeks 
from now in the States of Iowa, New 
Hampshire, and other States, followed 
very closely on by Super Tuesday. The 
election process is already underway, 
and I think that is the means by which 
most Americans believe we ought to 
deal with our leadership. In a demo-
cratic system of government, we have 
the opportunity as people to express 
our opinions and to voice our views in 
that manner. I hope that is where we 
can settle these political differences 
and disputes we have. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, while the House con-
tinues to be bogged down and stalled 
out over impeachment, the Senate is 
moving forward with the business that 
I think is important to the daily lives 
of the American people. 
Yesterday, the Senate Finance Com-
mittee passed the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement out of our com-
mittee. I serve as a member of that 
committee. I was pleased to vote to 
move this agreement one step closer to 
final approval by the full Senate. 
The 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement will benefit almost every 
sector of our economy, from manufac-
turing, to digital services, to the auto-
motive industry. It will create hun-
dreds of thousands of new jobs, boost 
our economic output, and increase 
wages for workers. 
The agreement breaks new ground by 
including a chapter specifically focused 
on small and medium-sized businesses. 
This is the first time a U.S. trade 
agreement has ever included a dedi-
cated chapter on this topic. Roughly 
120,000 small and medium-sized busi-
nesses around our country export goods 
and services to Mexico and Canada, in-
cluding a number of businesses in my 
home State of South Dakota. USMCA 
will make it easier for these businesses 
to successfully export their product. 
South Dakota businesses and con-
sumers will also benefit from the fact 
that the agreement maintains the cur-
rent U.S. de minimis threshold—some-
thing I fought hard to protect. 
I am also particularly excited about 
the benefits the USMCA will bring to 
farmers and ranchers. Farmers and 
ranchers have had a tough time over 
the past few years. Low commodity 
and livestock prices, natural disasters, 
and protracted trade disputes have left 
farmers and ranchers in my home 
State of South Dakota and around the 
country struggling. 
I spend a lot of time at home talking 
to farmers and ranchers. Again and 
again, they have emphasized to me 
that the most important thing Wash-
ington can do to boost our Nation’s 
farm economy is to conclude favorable 
trade deals. That is why I have spent a 
lot of time this past year pushing for 
adoption of the United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement and why I am so 
pleased that after a long year waiting 
for the House under Speaker PELOSI to 
take it up and act on it, we are finally 
going to have the opportunity to ap-
prove that trade deal in the Senate. 
Canada and Mexico are the No. 1 and 
No. 2 markets for American agricul-
tural products. The United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement will preserve 
and expand farmers’ access to these 
two critical export markets, and it will 
give farmers certainty about what 
these markets will look like long term. 
I am particularly excited about the 
improvements the agreement makes 
for dairy farmers. If you drive the I–29 
corridor north of Brookings, SD, you 
will see firsthand the major dairy ex-
pansion South Dakota has experienced 
over the past several decades—I should 
say, over the past several years. 
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
will preserve U.S. dairy farmers’ role 
as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and 
it will substantially expand market ac-
cess in Canada. In fact, the U.S. Inter-
national Trade Commission estimates 
that the agreement will boost U.S. 
dairy exports by more than $277 mil-
lion. The agreement will also expand 
market access for U.S. poultry and egg 
producers. It will make it easier for 
U.S. producers to export wheat to Can-
ada. 
There is so much more in this agree-
ment. 
Yesterday’s Finance Committee vote 
was a long time coming for South Da-
kota farmers and ranchers. Months of 
delay by House Democrats left agri-
culture producers wondering if they 
would ever see the benefits of this 
agreement. But we have at last been 
able to move forward, and I look for-
ward to full Senate passage of the 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
trade 
agreement in the very near future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the nomination 
of Michael George DeSombre, of Illi-
nois, to be Ambassador Extraordinary 
and Plenipotentiary of the United 
States of America to the Kingdom of 
Thailand, shall be brought to a close? 
The yeas and nays are mandatory 
under the rule.

Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Tennessee (Mr. ALEXANDER) and 
the 
Senator 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Tennessee (Mr. ALEX-
ANDER) would have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from New Jersey (Mr. BOOKER),

IRAN 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day evening, Iran launched more than 
a dozen ballistic missiles against mili-
tary bases in Iraq, which house U.S. 
troops. 
After General Qasem Soleimani was 
killed in a targeted drone strike late 
last week in an act of self-defense and 
to deter further aggression against 
America and our allies, our forces were 
on high alert for an Iranian attack. 
President Trump and our military 
leaders emphasized that we would be 
prepared for whatever response Iran 
chose to deliver, and by all accounts we 
were. 
If the present circumstances hold, it 
appears that no U.S. servicemembers 
were harmed during this attack last 
night by Iran, which is the best out-
come we could have hoped for. In addi-
tion, I am glad no Iraqi troops appear 
to have been injured or killed in this 
strike as well. 
While the result of this provocation 
by Iran could have been a lot worse, it 
does not diminish the fact that the 
world’s leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism has a sophisticated and capable 
ballistic program. We know that those 
capabilities only accelerated under the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action— 
the so-called nuclear deal during the 
previous administration—as has the re-
gime’s pursuit of their nuclear aspira-
tions. 
I am confident that this administra-
tion’s 
maximum-pressure 
campaign, 
combined with our unparalleled mili-
tary capabilities, as well as the Presi-
dent’s decisive actions that have cul-
minated in the airstrike last week, 
have prevented a much worse outcome 
from this attack by Iran. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
visit Strategic Command, STRATCOM, 
in Omaha, NE, where their motto is 
‘‘strategic deterrence.’’ I think that is 
an important goal to keep in mind; 
that is, having the means and capabili-
ties not only of hitting back but a mes-
sage of deterrence to our adversaries to 
dissuade them from initiating hos-
tilities in the first place. 
President Ronald Reagan had his own 
notion of strategic deterrence. He 
called it ‘‘peace through strength.’’ I 
believe that is something the Presi-
dent’s actions last week have begun to 
restore, no less a luminary than former 
GEN David Petraeus, who said, after 
the Soleimani attack, that perhaps— 
just perhaps—this would reestablish 
deterrence. Indeed, based on the re-
sponse by the Iranian regime last 
night, where they obviously targeted 
uninhabited areas, and they wanted to 
save face by showing that they were 
doing something to retaliate but not 
wanting to escalate, I think General 
Petraeus is right on. What has hap-
pened, to this point, is reestablishing 
some level of deterrence. 
I applaud the President for speaking 
to the American people this morning 
and making it clear that, under his 
watch, Iran will never ever have a nu-
clear weapon. In my view, this is the 
single most important policy objective 
for the United States and our allies in 
the Middle East. 
Deterrence through strength, com-
bined with additional economic sanc-
tions, are designed to encourage and 
persuade the Iranian regime to rejoin 
the community of nations, which will 
help pave the way for a better way of 
life for the Iranian people and to give 
up these tools of terror which have 
characterized the Iranian regime since 
1979, since the revolution—exporting 
that terror to other countries. There 
was no one more responsible for doing 
that than General Soleimani, who was 
taken out in an airstrike last week. 
As we move forward, the United 
States and our allies can’t turn back. 
We can’t relieve this maximum-pres-
sure campaign, and we also must re-
main cognizant of the dangers of cre-
ating power vacuums in the Middle 
East. 
I also hope our allies in Germany, 
France, and the United Kingdom will 
work with us to persuade the U.N. to 
invoke the snapback provisions under 
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion to restore international sanctions 
and restrictions on the Iranian regime 
to further persuade them to join us in 
negotiations, which will lead to a bet-
ter outcome for all. It will be helpful if 
our friends and allies in the UK, 
France, and Germany will join us in 
that effort. 
While the United States has not pur-
posely sought out further conflict that 
could lead to an unnecessary loss of 
life, we need to defend—we must al-
ways defend American personnel and 
our interests in the Middle East. 
As the President has pointed out this 
morning, one of the things that, his-
torically, has given Presidents like 
Jimmy Carter the determination to de-
clare the blocking of the Strait of 
Hormuz as an act of war during his ad-
ministration was our overdependence 
on energy from the Middle East. As the 
President pointed out this morning, 
thanks to the creativity and innova-
tion in places like Oklahoma, Texas, 
North Dakota, and elsewhere, we are 
now largely energy independent and 
self-sufficient. We can now use this as 
a tool to engage other countries that 
are completely dependent on countries 
like Russia, Iran, and others in the 
Middle East for their energy needs. So 
this is changing the geopolitics of the 
world. This is not just the President 
taking a divisive action against the 
leading master of terrorism in the Mid-
dle East; the geopolitics of the world 
have shifted, and I hope we will all 
work together to take advantage of 
that. 
As I said, I appreciate the President’s 
courage and leadership. This must have 
been no easy decision, to be sure. I con-
tinue to be proud of our military lead-
ership and the rank-and-file service-
members who have worked so hard to 
protect the United States and our na-
tional interests in the Middle East and 
around the world. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. President, on another matter, I 
spoke last week on the Senate floor 
about some of the great things that 
have been accomplished this last year 
for our country, including my home 
State of Texas. 
I pointed out that we notched a num-
ber of wins for the American military 
as well as our veterans. We sent much 
needed assistance to communities dev-
astated by natural disasters, like Hur-
ricane Harvey and others. We con-
firmed more qualified judges to the 
Federal bench. We invested heavily in 
securing America’s elections from the 
sort of interference we saw occur in the 
last Presidential election, and I am 
proud to say we strengthened our fight 
to end the rape kit backlog.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S71 
January 8, 2020 
We made strides, big and small, to 
improve the lives of the American peo-
ple, and I am eager to add more wins to 
that list this year. 
Unfortunately, Congress is starting 
this year in a rather inauspicious way, 
not designed to regain the confidence 
of the American people and our ability 
to do what benefits them as opposed to 
satisfying some partisan political in-
terest. 
High on that list of pretty embar-
rassing developments are the Articles 
of Impeachment that the House passed. 
Three weeks after the House said this 
urgent matter must be pushed through 
to protect the country and defend the 
Constitution, Speaker PELOSI is still 
refusing to send those Articles of Im-
peachment to the Senate, and we are 
waiting. Now, I would be happy if she 
never sent the Articles of Impeachment 
here and realizes the error of the 
House’s ways, but I don’t expect that 
to happen. 
In the meantime, we are going to 
continue 
to 
confirm 
well-qualified 
nominees, as we are today, and hope-
fully we will be able to do work on the 
USMCA—the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade 
agreement—which, as the Presiding Of-
ficer knows, we voted out of the Senate 
Finance 
Committee 
yesterday 
but 
which has to clear six other commit-
tees before it is ready for floor action. 
Hopefully, we will be able to get that 
done sooner rather than later. 
With 
an 
impending 
impeachment 
trial consuming most of the oxygen 
here in Washington, there is not a lot 
of opportunity, let alone political will, 
to get actual legislating done. 
There is a laundry list of bills we 
could add to our accomplishments in 
2020, but there is an opportunity cost 
when we are squandering our time on 
this 
ill-considered 
impeachment 
mania. The time and effort we are 
spending on that could well be used to 
pass these other pieces of legislation, 
but these pieces of legislation wait in 
impeachment purgatory. 
At the top of my list this year is leg-
islation to bring down healthcare costs 
to the American people, particularly 
out-of-pocket costs for prescription 
drugs—something I thought was a high 
priority for Members on both sides of 
the aisle as well as the White House. 
Over the summer, the Senate Judici-
ary, Finance, and Health, Education, 
Labor, 
and 
Pensions 
Committees 
passed bipartisan bills which deal with 
everything from high prescription drug 
prices 
to 
surprise 
medical 
billing. 
While we knew there was still addi-
tional work that needed to be done, ev-
eryone was somewhat optimistic that 
we could pass some combination of 
these bills by the end of last year. Un-
fortunately, that didn’t happen. 
Negotiations are continuing, but I 
had hoped we could make progress on 
some noncontroversial bills in the 
meantime, like the one I introduced to 
stop drugmakers from gaming the pat-
ent system. 
I just read this morning that the 
manufacturer of HUMIRA, which is an 
incredible drug and the most widely 
prescribed drug in America, is raising 
their list price by 7 percent. This is a 
drug that has generic competitors 
overseas, but they are not approved 
here in the United States because 
HUMIRA has gamed the patent system 
by acquiring more than 120 different 
patents on this drug, the same one that 
is being sold cheaper and more widely 
available in Europe. 
The 
bill 
I 
introduced 
with 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, the Senator from Con-
necticut, to deal with that is called the 
Affordable Prescriptions for Patients 
Act. It strikes a delicate balance of 
protecting innovation while increasing 
competition. It would be a win for 
every American who has felt the stick-
er shock at the pharmacy. This bill is 
a modest bill, but it represents real 
progress. 
Bipartisan 
support—check 
that box. I introduced this bill with 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
from 
Con-
necticut, as I mentioned, and I am 
proud to have the support of the minor-
ity whip as well as the ranking member 
of the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee. This passed out 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
unanimously. 
Well, does it increase the deficit? No, 
it actually helps the deficit, so we can 
check that box. The Congressional 
Budget Office estimates the bill would 
save the government more than half a 
billion dollars over the next decade, 
not to mention what it might do to pri-
vate insurance costs. 
During simpler times, this bill would 
have been quickly approved by the Sen-
ate and sent to the House for their con-
sideration and the President’s signa-
ture. If we have learned anything these 
last few years, it is that nothing is 
simple here in Congress or in Wash-
ington. 
So, after waiting for months, I came 
to the Senate floor to ask that the bill 
be passed. After all, it sailed through 
the process, and I hadn’t heard a single 
Senator with any substantive objection 
to the bill. That is when the Demo-
cratic leader, the Senator from New 
York, came down here to block it, and 
he did it not once but twice. He didn’t 
object on substance. In fact, he admit-
ted it was a good bill. As I said, it 
checks every box when it comes to 
good legislation, so it certainly wasn’t 
because it fell short there. 
The only reason the Democratic lead-
er objected to this legislation on two 
separate occasions is because of poli-
tics. He has chosen to participate in 
political games with a bill that is non-
controversial 
and 
straightforward, 
which would stop Big Pharma from 
abusing the patent system to increase 
their profits and increase prices to con-
sumers. 
At a time when he views his most 
critical priority as minority leader to 
oppose the President and, in turn, Sen-
ate Republicans, he couldn’t stand to 
see a bill introduced by a Republican 
actually advance and become law. I am 
sure his constituents in New York 
can’t be too happy about that because 
they are paying the high price of pat-
ent gamesmanship too. I can guarantee 
you that Big Pharma is rejoicing over 
his obstruction. 
Well, as I said just this last week, big 
drug companies have already begun to 
announce their price increases. Accord-
ing to their analysis, 445 different 
drugs have had their prices raised al-
ready by an average of 5 percent, and 
we are only 1 week into the new year. 
It is particularly maddening that 
even consensus legislation is getting 
caught up in this hyperpartisan envi-
ronment. But I am hoping that, once 
this looming impeachment trial is be-
hind us, we can find a way to work to-
gether and make some progress. 
Another bill that I am anxious to see 
pass this year is a reauthorization of 
the Violence Against Women Act, 
which again has gotten caught up in 
partisan gamesmanship. Last year the 
House passed an ultrapartisan bill, 
which both parties knew would be dead 
on arrival in the Senate. Our friends, 
the House Democrats, chose to include 
a variety of poison pills in order to 
prove a point and perhaps gain some 
political advantage rather than to ac-
tually get a bill to the President’s 
desk. 
Well, that is where Senator FEIN-
STEIN, the Senator from California, and 
Senator ERNST, the Senator from Iowa, 
to their credit, tried long and hard to 
try to come up with a bill that we 
could take up here on the Senate floor, 
but all of a sudden, late in the game, 
our friends across the aisle walked 
away from the negotiating table and 
chose to introduce a near replica of the 
House’s partisan piece of legislation. 
Unfortunately, they succumbed to 
the politics of the moment rather than 
solving the problem that would actu-
ally help support victims of violence 
and reauthorize that legislation. De-
spite our Democratic colleagues leav-
ing those negotiations, though, our col-
league from Iowa, Senator ERNST, con-
tinued to work in good faith on a bill 
to reauthorize the Violence Against 
Women Act, and I am proud to be a co-
sponsor. 
I urge the majority leader to put that 
piece of legislation on the floor and to 
do it at the earliest possible moment so 
that we can have a vote, we can have a 
debate, we can offer amendments, but 
we can actually get the job done rather 
than continuing to use this as a polit-
ical football. It sends more funding and 
resources than the bill that the Demo-
crats have proposed, and it authorizes 
the program for twice as long. 
It is not just an alternative; it is a 
better choice for victims of sexual as-
sault and violence. It includes a whole 
lot more than funding, though. It ad-
dresses a number of horrific crimes 
that are being committed against 
women and girls around the country, 
which are not included in our Demo-
crat colleagues’ version. 
I regret that we were unable to pass 
a reauthorization for the Violence

Against Women Act, and I hope our 
colleagues across the aisle will recon-
sider and come back to the negotiating 
table and work with us so that we can 
finally reauthorize this program. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, finally, another pri-
ority that I alluded to a moment ago 
that I hope we can get to soon is to 
pass the USMCA, the United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement, which will 
succeed NAFTA and guide our trading 
relationships with Mexico and Canada 
into the future. 
NAFTA has been a boon for our econ-
omy—especially 
in 
my 
State, 
in 
Texas—but it is time to bring this 
more than quarter-century-old agree-
ment into the 21st century. That is pre-
cisely what the USMCA will do. It 
modernizes trade with our northern 
and southern neighbors and lays the 
foundation for better economies, more 
jobs, and greater prosperity for each of 
our countries. 
The process of getting that bill 
across the Senate floor has been more 
than a year in the making, but we are 
making some progress, as I indicated, 
starting yesterday in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee. It was reported out 
with a bipartisan vote of 25 for and 3 
against. 
I haven’t been shy about expressing 
my concerns about how this process 
has played out, especially cutting the 
Senate out of its negotiating position 
under trade promotion authority, but I 
do believe, on net, that this agreement 
is beneficial and will support it. 
So I look forward to getting an op-
portunity, presumably once Speaker 
PELOSI sends the Articles of Impeach-
ment over here and it meets its ex-
pected fate. Nobody I know expects 67 
Senators to vote to convict and to re-
move President Trump based on the 
thin gruel presented by the two Arti-
cles of Impeachment that were voted 
on by the House in an ultrapartisan 
manner. 
Once we get past all of that, I hope 
we can continue along the series of 
wins for our country in 2020, and I, for 
one, am eager to work on that. I hope 
we will be able to chart a path forward 
on an impeachment trial in the near 
future so that we can begin focusing on 
this legislation that will help the 
American people over the next 12 
months and not squander a minute 
more than absolutely necessary. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully to the comments by my 
colleague from Texas, Senator CORNYN, 
when he talked about impeachment 
purgatory and the fact that the Senate 
is unable to act on critical legisla-
tion—many bills that have already 
passed the House of Representatives— 
because 
of 
the 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings. 
Well, the impeachment proceedings 
have not started in the U.S. Senate. So 
what is the excuse? Was it the im-
peachment proceeding that stopped us 
from considering one bill in the Senate 
this week? Was it the impeachment 
proceeding that stopped us from con-
sidering one bill in the Senate last 
week? No, it was the conscious decision 
of the Senate majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader, 
with the Republican majority, not to 
call a single piece of legislation in the 
last 2 weeks. 
There 
shouldn’t 
be 
any 
surprise 
among the membership that we did 
nothing in the last 2 weeks other than 
a few garden-variety nominations. The 
fact is, we have done nothing for a long 
time under Senator MCCONNELL’s lead-
ership. Do you know, for the record, 
how many amendments were actually 
debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
last year in the entire calendar year? 
Twenty-two. Twenty-two amendments, 
six offered by the junior Senator from 
Kentucky. If I am not mistaken, all of 
them were defeated, but the point I am 
trying to make is, 22 amendments in 1 
year and now the Republican majority 
is blaming Speaker PELOSI and the im-
peachment proceedings for the fact 
that we do nothing. It doesn’t make 
sense, and it doesn’t add up. 
We are doing nothing because that is 
the strategy of Senator MCCONNELL. 
The House of Representatives has 
passed hundreds—not a dozen, hun-
dreds—of bills for the Senate to con-
sider, on every imaginable topic: issues 
relating to healthcare, which we heard 
about from the Senator from Texas; 
issues relating to immigration. The lit-
any is long. Within that litany, you 
would think that Senator MCCONNELL 
could find one bill—just one—from the 
House of Representatives to debate on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, but we 
don’t do that in the Senate. We no 
longer debate under Senator MCCON-
NELL’s leadership. 
Some people look at this room and 
call it the Senate Chamber. That is 
true; it is the Senate Chamber. Now, 
sadly, it is more the Senate storage fa-
cility. We store on the floor of the Sen-
ate Chamber the desks of former Sen-
ators who actually legislated on the 
floor of the Senate. It is not a museum 
because there is still some active busi-
ness underway, but it is a storage facil-
ity. 
These desks, if they could only 
speak, would tell the stories of men 
and women who stood up on the floor 
and debated critical issues. I was here 
for some of it. Issues of war and 
peace—we don’t take those up any-
more. If a President wants to go to war 
in Iran, obviously, his party thinks 
that we shouldn’t interfere with his 
thought process, though the Constitu-
tion states clearly we are supposed to 
interfere. Congress has the authority, 
under the Constitution, to declare war. 
When issues would come up before 
us—important issues—in the past, we 
would debate them at length, whether 
it was health insurance for Americans, 
whether we were talking about ques-
tions of the disabled in America being 
active participants in our society, a 
time when Senators from both sides of 
the aisle stood up in this Chamber and, 
in a lengthy debate, passed the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act. One was 
Senator Bob Dole, a disabled veteran 
from World War II and Republican 
leader; another was Tom Harkin, a 
Democrat from Iowa. The two of them 
had a bipartisan measure and a real 
fulsome debate that doesn’t happen on 
this floor of this Senate Chamber any-
more. 
For Senators to come here and blame 
NANCY
PELOSI, the Speaker of the 
House, for our inactivity is laughable. 
We have failed to move forward be-
cause the leadership does not want to 
call the bill. Senator MCCONNELL has 
the authority to decide what we will 
debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
and he has decided we will debate noth-
ing—nothing. 
What a wasted opportunity. If Amer-
ica was just picture-perfect from sea to 
shining sea, you would say: Well, there 
is no reason. We don’t need a Senate or 
a House. We know better. There are im-
portant 
issues 
we 
should 
address, 
issues related to challenges facing fam-
ilies across America; issues of the 
mounting student debt across this 
country and what it has meant to hun-
dreds of thousands of young people and 
their future; the issues involving gun 
violence in this country, where we still 
have mass killings yet can’t even pass 
one bill to keep guns out of the hands 
of convicted felons and people who are 
mentally 
unstable; 
the 
issue 
of 
healthcare. 
I certainly agree with the Senator 
from Texas when it comes to the cost 
of prescription drugs, the No. 1 concern 
of families across this country. All 
Senator SCHUMER has asked for is that 
we bring this measure to the floor and 
let Senator CORNYN’s good idea be 
brought to the floor with Senator DUR-
BIN’s good idea—and perhaps other Sen-
ators’ good ideas—and actually have a 
debate right here on the floor of the 
Senate. It would be amazing. People 
would be tuned in all across America 
saying: You can’t imagine; the Senate 
is alive; it is actually considering 
measures. 
Although, 
we 
don’t. 
Twenty-two 
amendments in one calendar year—it is 
just amazing that we have reached that 
point. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. President, I come to the floor to 
address three specific issues. One of the 
first is a matter that I didn’t know 
would actually be part of my responsi-
bility as a Senator, but over the years 
my staff came to me and talked to me 
about political prisoners in far-flung 
nations around the world, men and 
women literally in jail because they 
are exercising their right to speak, to 
be journalists, to assemble, to run for 
political office. 
My staff said: They are forgotten. 
Nobody knows they are there. They 
languish in prisons for months and

years and sometimes die there. Nobody 
even mentions their name. Would you 
consider coming to the floor of the 
Senate and saying something, perhaps 
writing a letter to the Embassy of the 
country where they are being held pris-
oner? 
I was skeptical as to whether or not 
that would even be worth the effort, 
but I have learned over the years it is. 
I have come to the Senate floor to raise 
the cases of political prisoners around 
the world, typically journalists or ac-
tivists who found themselves jailed for 
defending basic freedoms we take for 
granted. 
In some cases, with the help of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we 
have seen the release of some of these 
prisoners. Others still languish. 
I bring their pictures to the floor be-
cause mentioning their names is im-
portant, but seeing them tells a story 
too. 
Raif 
Badawi 
and 
Waleed 
Abulkhair, in Saudi Arabia, and in-
terim Venezuelan President Guaido’s 
chief of staff Roberto Marrero continue 
to languish unjustly in prison. We con-
tinue to press for their release. 
I always thought that trying to se-
cure the release of political prisoners 
was worthwhile because it spoke to our 
values as Americans. I have had a 
chance to meet some of them after 
they were released. 
It is an amazing feeling after some-
one has spent years—literally years—in 
prison and comes to my office in the 
Capitol and breaks down in tears in 
gratitude. It reminds me that they 
shouldn’t be forgotten, and neither 
should many others. 
Unfortunately, this President is too 
comfortable 
with 
these 
autocratic 
leaders who imprison people around the 
world. I wish he weren’t. 
That brings me to the Philippines, 
one of our key democratic allies in 
Asia. Over the Christmas break, I 
thought my friends were joking with 
me when they came to me and said: 
Well, I guess you will not be going to 
the Philippines soon. I didn’t know 
what they were talking about. 
It turns out that in my home State, 
in Illinois, there are many Filipino 
Americans. It is one of the largest im-
migrant groups coming to our country. 
What an incredible population Filipino 
Americans are. As I have come to know 
them, they have strong family values 
and strong religious values, and they 
are hard-working folks. They open 
these little shops and sit in them for 16 
hours or 18 hours a day because that is 
the way an immigrating Filipino sets 
the stage for their son and daughter to 
have a better life. 
Over the holiday recess, the Presi-
dent of the Philippines, President 
Duterte, announced that he was ban-
ning 
Senator 
PATRICK
LEAHY
of 
Vermont, as well as myself and Sen-
ator ED
MARKEY
of Massachusetts, 
from ever visiting the Philippines. I 
was kind of shocked to see that. I 
didn’t expect that. 
What precipitated this reaction? He 
also, incidentally, threatened to re-
strict the travel of all Americans to 
the Philippines. For some time, several 
of us, including Senator LEAHY
and 
Senator MARKEY, have been advocating 
for the release of Filipina Senator 
Leila de Lima. Senator de Lima was a 
former head of the National Human 
Rights Commission of the Philippines 
and 
an 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights champion critical of 
President 
Duterte’s 
extrajudicial 
killings. 
What did that lead to? Her arrest and 
her being sentenced and imprisoned for 
up to 3 years in jail for speaking out 
against the current President of the 
Philippines. 
Here is a photo of her being taken to 
court after she was arrested a little 
over 3 years ago. 
Who is behind her release? Not just 
Senators LEAHY, DURBIN, and MARKEY 
and many of our colleagues, but also 
Amnesty International, the Tom Lan-
tos Human Rights Commission, and the 
Raoul Wallenberg Center. 
Let me read an excerpt from the let-
ter she sent me. 
As you can imagine, I may be the one cur-
rently in detention, but I am not the only 
victim suffering in this situation . . . so are 
the victims of extrajudicial killings and 
their families, so are all defenders of human 
rights . . . and ultimately, so are all of us all 
over the world who defend democracy and 
rule of law. 
Senator MARKEY
has a resolution 
calling for Senator de Lima’s release 
and an end to the harassment of 
Filipina journalist Maria Ressa, which 
I am proud to cosponsor and hope will 
pass the Senate soon. 
Last year, Senator LEAHY joined me 
in an amendment to the State and For-
eign Operations bill, denying U.S. visas 
to those involved in Senator de Lima’s 
politically motivated incarceration. It 
was our little measure in that appro-
priations 
bill 
that 
led 
President 
Duterte to ban us from ever traveling 
to the Philippines. There is an easy and 
honorable way forward. The Duterte 
regime should stop threatening the 
travel of Filipino Americans and so 
many others who travel between our 
nations and, instead, ensure a quick 
and credible trial for Senator de Lima 
or simply do the right thing and re-
lease her. 
In the end, her freedom and the end 
of government harassment of journal-
ists like Maria Ressa will be important 
tests of whether the cherished demo-
cratic norms we share with our long-
standing Filipino allies will be re-
spected by President Duterte. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, trade agreements are 
controversial. They come before the 
Senate and the House infrequently and 
are usually very hard to pass. It takes 
months and months of work. One of 
those 
trade 
agreements, 
which 
is 
known as the USMCA, or the United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or 
NAFTA 2.0, is one that I have watched 
carefully. I voted for the original 
NAFTA agreement when I was a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives. It 
was not a popular vote among many 
people in Illinois, but I felt that it was 
the right thing to do. I felt that mov-
ing the Mexican economy forward, 
watching it mature, with the creation 
of a middle class, would mean that it 
would be a more stable nation and a 
nation 
that 
would 
consume 
many 
goods produced in the United States. 
That happened, but it happened at an 
expense, too, to be very honest. Many 
companies in the United States saw the 
low wage rates in Mexico, closed their 
plants in places like Galesburg, IL, and 
moved operations to Mexico. Some 
moved to China and other places. 
That displacement of jobs was pain-
ful. It was hard to explain to families 
that this was a transition that ulti-
mately was for the good of all nations 
involved. If it was your family, you 
didn’t care about the good of a nation. 
You wanted to know if dad had a job. 
The pain we went through over the 
last 25 years led me into this conversa-
tion about the USMCA with some skep-
ticism. I didn’t want to be behind any 
effort that would ultimately result in 
more American jobs being lost unnec-
essarily. I am proud to say that this 
negotiation, unlike many things in this 
town, turned out to be a bipartisan suc-
cess. 
President Trump presented us with 
an original version of the USMCA, and 
many of us took exception to some of 
its contents. I was particularly worried 
about one provision in there relating to 
the price of prescription drugs and 
some other provisions in the original 
measure. Then, a fulsome negotiation 
took place. Democrats and Republicans 
sat down. The net result was a positive 
thing. Just this last week, the Senate 
Finance 
Committee 
reported 
this 
USMCA by a vote of 25 to 3. I believe 
this bill—this new measure, this new 
NAFTA—enjoys broad bipartisan sup-
port. 
This morning, I went on a conference 
call with the agriculture leaders of Illi-
nois. I am proud to say we have one of 
the strongest agricultural States in the 
Nation and some of the best women 
and men who farm our land and 
produce food and fiber for people to 
consume all across America and around 
the world. They have gone through 
some very tough times. The President’s 
trade problems with China have hurt 
us especially. Our soybean producers 
have seen a 93-percent decline in their 
exports of soybeans and soybean prod-
ucts from the State of Illinois. They 
have paid heavily for the decision in 
this administration to cut back on re-
newable fuels and to issue waivers to 
oil companies so they don’t have to 
blend them in the fuel they sell us at 
gas stations. 
They have seen the decline in the net 
foreign income, an increase in foreign 
debt, and we have sent aid payments to 
them, which they reluctantly accept as 
just the only lifeline they have to keep 
their farms in the family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S74 
January 8, 2020 
They are happy to see that we are 
moving forward on this new trade 
agreement. 
A 
new 
NAFTA—the 
USMCA—means the top trading part-
ners of the State of Illinois, Mexico and 
Canada, will have a new lease on a rela-
tionship that can improve as we in-
crease trade among our nations. The 
three nations will prosper. Our bounty, 
which we produce in the farmlands of 
Illinois, will be shared with Mexico, 
Canada, and many nations far beyond 
them. It is a step forward for us. 
I am glad it was done on a bipartisan 
basis, and I am particularly happy to 
see the overwhelming majority of labor 
organizations in my State of Illinois 
and in the Nation support the USMCA. 
It is great to have both labor and busi-
ness and farm communities together in 
this effort. 
It is far from perfect. This is a bill 
that moves in the right direction, and 
I hope we bring it up for consideration 
and a vote very soon on the floor of the 
Senate. 
E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. President, for many years, I have 
had a battle on with the tobacco lobby. 
It is personal. I lost my father to lung 
cancer when I was 14 and he was 53. I 
watched and stood by his bedside for 
literally 100 days as he languished and 
ultimately died from lung cancer. He 
smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. 
When I came to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, I was determined to 
try to do something about the deaths 
that were being caused by tobacco 
products across America. I proposed a 
measure, which seemed pretty modest 
at the time, that banned smoking on 
airplane flights. It was an inconven-
ience and a mess to get on a plane with 
the so-called smoking and nonsmoking 
sections. So I thought: Let’s get rid of 
it once and for all. 
It was quite a battle in the House of 
Representatives. We passed it by a 
handful of votes, to ban smoking on 
airplanes. Luckily, I found a great col-
league and friend, former Senator 
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who 
took up the cause on the floor of the 
Senate, and we banned smoking on air-
planes over 25 years ago. 
I didn’t know that it was anything 
more than elimination of an inconven-
ience 
while 
people 
took 
airplane 
flights. It turned out to be much more. 
It turned out to be a tipping point. 
People across America said: If it is 
unhealthy to breathe in second-hand 
smoke on an airplane, how about 
trains? How about buses? How about of-
fices? How about hospitals? How about 
restaurants? 
At the end of the day, we know what 
happened. If someone walked into your 
home or your place of business and lit 
up a cigarette, you would look at them 
and think: Where are you from? We 
don’t do that anymore. 
We certainly don’t do it without ask-
ing permission. But that is what has 
happened in America. 
We had to fight the tobacco lobby 
every step of the way, and we have had 
some success. The number of young 
people who were using tobacco ciga-
rette products declined dramatically, 
from over 20 percent to around 8 per-
cent. We were winning the battle be-
cause these tobacco companies were re-
cruiting our kids at an early age with 
a nicotine addiction they couldn’t 
shake later in life. 
Guess what happened. The tobacco 
companies invented a new product that 
is called e-cigarette, or vaping. If you 
think I am making this connection up, 
take a look at the largest vendor of 
vaping devices, JUUL, and look at the 
major shareholder of JUUL. It turns 
out to be Altria, which also turns out 
to be a major tobacco company. 
Now the tobacco companies have de-
cided that since kids don’t gravitate 
toward tobacco cigarettes, they will 
give them an alternative. The alter-
native is an e-cigarette, or a vaping de-
vice. 
You know what has happened, Mr. 
President, in your State and in my 
mine? High school kids are taking up 
this vaping addiction in numbers un-
imaginable. The latest report suggests 
that almost 29 percent of high school 
students across the United States are 
currently vaping. What they are doing 
is using pods and flavor pods with nico-
tine included and using an electronic 
device to inhale this vapor and blow it 
out. Unfortunately, in inhaling it into 
their lungs, they are also inhaling nic-
otine and developing a terrible addic-
tion. 
Students from New York came to my 
office a few weeks ago, and they said: 
Senator, don’t kid yourself. It is not 28 
or 29 percent. It is over 50 percent of 
students who are vaping today, and 
they are desperate to buy these flavor 
pods and to buy these new JUUL de-
vices. When the teacher in a classroom 
steps out, they are all vaping, right 
there in the classroom. They do it in 
the restrooms and the classrooms and 
the cafeterias and outside the schools. 
They are doing desperate things to be 
able to afford these devices. 
On September 11 of this year, Presi-
dent Trump and the First Lady held a 
press conference in the Oval Office. 
Though I have been critical of this 
President for many things, I applauded 
what they said. They recognized this 
vaping crisis, and they said that we are 
going to stop it and that we are going 
to make the moves necessary to make 
sure that these flavor pods that are en-
ticing children are finally taken from 
the market. 
I couldn’t believe my ears when I 
heard it. Here was President Trump 
stepping up to do the right thing. Per-
haps he and his wife, as a father and a 
mother of a teenager, understand this 
better than some. But whatever the 
reason, whatever the motivation, they 
came forward with what I thought was 
the best proposal: End the flavor pods 
once and for all. 
After they made their announce-
ments, the vaping industry went to 
work. They started buying ads on 
FOX—naturally, that is where the 
President watches television—and they 
started saying to the people that it was 
unfair to take away these flavor pods. 
Sadly, these flavor pods, when you 
look at them very closely, are just an 
enticement for young people to use this 
product. 
Now the vaping industry tries to 
argue: Well, wait a minute. People who 
want tobacco cigarettes ought to have 
vaping as an alternative. It is safer. 
Well, marginally it may be, if that 
were the end of the story. But it turns 
out that vaping device is also becoming 
an enticement for young people to use 
flavor pods and to develop this addic-
tion to nicotine of vaping devices. It is 
impossible to argue that some veteran 
smoker of tobacco products is going to 
be enticed to vaping if he can buy 
candy flavors, bubble gum flavors, fruit 
flavors, or other flavors. Can you imag-
ine some 50-year-old who has been 
smoking Marlboro for years, and says: 
Man, if I could just get my hands on 
some Unicorn milk flavor pods, I would 
give up tobacco and move to e-ciga-
rettes. 
We know better. These pods are de-
signed to entice children. 
(Mr. ROMNEY assumed the chair.) 
We waited to see what would happen 
after the President’s September an-
nouncement. We were lucky to have 
one of our own colleagues, from the 
State of Utah, who has now taken the 
Chair, who was present at the meeting 
with the President on the issue of 
vaping. I salute him for his friendship 
and leadership on this issue. 
Last week, after delays, President 
Trump finally announced a plan to ban 
some of the e-cigarette flavors that are 
hooking our kids on nicotine. Within 30 
days, some flavored e-cigarette pods 
and cartridges will be removed from 
the market. This is an important step, 
but it is not nearly enough. For in-
stance, menthol pods are exempt, so I 
am afraid kids are just going to move 
to JUUL’s menthol flavor. Further, liq-
uid e-cigarette flavors that are used in 
open-tank vaping shops are also ex-
empt. The vaping shops are still in 
business, unaffected by this new policy 
of the administration. Liquid nicotine 
is sold in flavors like Gummy Bear, 
Whip Cream, Sugar Cookie, and Uni-
corn Milk. These flavors, definitely in-
tended for kids, will stay under Presi-
dent Trump’s new policy. 
This week’s announcement is not 
what the President said would happen 
in the Oval Office a few months ago. 
That is why the public health commu-
nity and this Senator are so dis-
appointed. We know the President de-
cided to water down the e-cigarette fla-
vor ban. Heavy lobbying by Big To-
bacco and Big Vape were behind it. 
When announcing this new restriction, 
President Trump said some words that 
may tell the story. He said: 
We have to protect our families. At 
the same time, it’s a big industry. We 
want to protect the industry. 
Protect 
the 
vaping 
industry? 
It 
makes sense why these companies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S75 
January 8, 2020 
wanted the President to backtrack on 
his promise. They make a lot of money 
off our kids. They addict them, and the 
kids spend money because of the addic-
tion. Why doesn’t it make sense for the 
President to stand up to Big Tobacco 
and Big Vaping on behalf of our kids 
across America? 
The fight is not over. Fewer than 4 
percent of adults use e-cigarettes, 
while 30 percent, at least, of high 
school kids across America are using 
them. Now the FDA—with a new lead-
er, Dr. Stephen Hahn—has to come off 
the sidelines and do their job to protect 
the kids. By court order, all e-cigarette 
companies will have to submit applica-
tions to the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration in May if they want to keep 
their devices and flavors on the mar-
ket. If they do not submit an applica-
tion in May, they will have to come off 
the market immediately. The FDA 
must enforce this fully. For companies 
that do submit an application, the FDA 
has up to 1 year to decide whether they 
stay in the market. The FDA must re-
ject the applications of any vaping 
products that are clearly designed to 
appeal to children, period. And if they 
are significantly used by children, they 
should be taken off the market. 
I have told Commissioner Hahn that 
the FDA must evaluate these applica-
tions based on science, not anecdotes. 
What matters is that e-cigarette com-
panies 
prove 
their 
health 
claims, 
which, to date, they have never been 
able to do. Do e-cigarettes actually 
help smokers quit cigarettes? Are they 
actually safe? Or are they, in fact, 
hooking children on nicotine? Those 
are 
the 
important 
questions 
that 
should be answered with science, not 
with politics. 
There are ways to preserve e-ciga-
rette access for adult smokers without 
allowing an entire generation of kids 
to be hooked on nicotine. This means 
getting rid of all of the flavors, taking 
illegal products off the market imme-
diately, and rejecting e-cigarette appli-
cations that fail to show a strong pub-
lic health benefit. 
To date, the FDA has not been as ac-
tive or aggressive as it should. For the 
sake of our children and the families 
who love them, it is time for the FDA 
to get off the sidelines and make sure 
that we do everything in our power, in-
cluding in Congress, to make certain 
that this epidemic—and the FDA came 
up with the word—this epidemic of e- 
vaping and e-cigarettes comes to an 
end in America.

NOMINATION OF ELENI MARIA ROUMEL 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, for 
3 years now, I have been hard at work 
alongside 
an 
administration 
that 
prioritizes filling vacancies on the Fed-
eral bench with smart, dedicated, con-
stitutionalist judges. When I am at 
home in Tennessee, that is what people 
tell me they want to see—constitu-
tionalist judges, not activist judges. 
I know that I have sounded like a 
broken record in my reiterating just 
how important it is to keep these judi-
cial nominations moving through the 
Committee on the Judiciary and mov-
ing to the floor, but I will tell you this: 
I think it is a message that needs to be 
repeated day in and day out because 
the American people and, as I said, 
Tennesseans know that this should be 
a priority, for this is how we continue 
to protect freedoms from generation to 
generation. 
Since 2017, we have confirmed over 
180 nominees, and even in the face of 
partisan bickering, we have no plans at 
all to slow that pace. We were in the 
Committee on the Judiciary today, 
hearing again from the nominees whom 
we will move forward and bring to this 
floor for confirmation. I want to shine 
light on a court that doesn’t get a 
whole lot of attention, but let me tell 
you that we would be in real trouble if 
we did not have this one. 
I have come to the floor to support 
President Trump’s latest nominee to 
the U.S. Court of Federal Claims— 
Eleni Maria Roumel. 
I first met Eleni when she joined the 
nonpartisan Office of General Counsel 
for the House of Representatives. Dur-
ing her 6-year tenure, Eleni advised 
those of us who were members of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee as 
we faced some challenging and high- 
profile legal matters and as we looked 
at laws that were going to affect the 
American people and how they lived 
their lives every single day. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee in the House has wide jurisdic-
tion. Of course, energy policy, com-
merce and trade, healthcare, manufac-
turing, pro sports, privacy, and the 
internet all come under that jurisdic-
tion. So Eleni served us well in pro-
viding advice. I witnessed her commit-
ment to bipartisanship as she served 
both sides of the aisle with the same 
quality of representation. She did it all 
while she was pregnant with her son, 
John, who is now 2 years old, and as 
someone who has been a working mom, 
I know the challenges that this pre-
sents. 
From her time as a truly excellent 
student at Tulane Law, to her work in 
the private sector and beyond, Eleni’s 
professionalism has elevated her above 
the rest of the pack. 
She practiced intellectual property 
law and earned a promotion to partner 
as she represented both pro bono cli-
ents and publicly traded Fortune 500 
companies. 
She taught and mentored students as 
an adjunct professor at Charleston Law 
School. 
She solidified her reputation as a 
lawyer committed to the rule of law in 
her work handling government over-
sight of Federal agencies. These cases 
were vital to the safeguarding of the 
separation of powers and emphasized 
the supremacy of the Constitution as 
what it is—the law of the land. 
In her 19-year career, she has ap-
peared 
before 
20 
different 
Federal 
courts, including the U.S. Supreme 
Court, and just last year, she was ele-
vated to the role of Deputy Counsel to 
Vice President MIKE PENCE. 
I am truly honored to have supported 
Eleni Roumel’s nomination to the 
Court of Federal Claims. She will be an 
excellent role model on the bench, es-
pecially to young women in the legal 
profession. I encourage my colleagues 
to take a look at her resume, get to 
know her, and then join me in whole-
heartedly supporting her confirmation.

Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 340, S. Res. 385. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 385) celebrating the 
30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin 
Wall, the reunification of both Germany and 
Europe, and the spread of democracy around 
the world. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, without 
amendment, and with an amendment 
to the preamble to insert the part 
printed in italic, as follows: 
S. RES. 385 
Whereas November 9, 2019, marks the 30th 
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
one of the most visible symbols of com-
munism and the ‘‘Iron Curtain’’ that divided 
Europe, which led to the reunification of 
Germany; 
Whereas, beginning with the Russian Revo-
lution 
of 
1917, 
communist 
governments 
around the world denied freedom to and per-
secuted their citizens for most of the 20th 
century, resulting in the deaths of up to 
100,000,000 people; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of World War II, 
the Soviet Union established control over 
countries in Central and Eastern Europe and 
further increased its power through the foun-
dation of the Warsaw Pact military alliance 
between the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, 
Poland, and Romania; 
Whereas the Soviet Union blockade of West 
Berlin in the summer of 1948 left West Ber-
liners with only one month’s worth of provi-
sions; 
Whereas, in what became known as the 
‘‘Berlin Airlift’’, the United States and 
United Kingdom responded to the blockade 
by airlifting 2,325,809 tons of food and sup-
plies during 277,569 total flights into West 
Berlin; 
Whereas the Soviet Union was forced to 
lift the blockade of West Berlin on May 12, 
1949, in light of the success of the Berlin Air-
lift; 
Whereas the Berlin Wall, built in 1961, sep-
arated communist East Germany from demo-
cratic West Germany, dividing the German 
people and symbolically dividing the world 
into democratic and authoritarian spheres; 
Whereas, in West Berlin in 1963, President 
John F. Kennedy spoke out against the Ber-
lin Wall and communism, declaring that 
‘‘[f]reedom has many difficulties and democ-
racy is not perfect, but we have never had to 
put a wall up to keep our people in, to pre-
vent them from leaving us’’; 
Whereas, during the 28 years of the Berlin 
Wall’s existence, more than 75,000 people 
were imprisoned for attempting to leave 
East Germany, and more than 1,000 people 
are estimated to have been killed trying to 
escape; 
Whereas Soviet forces brutally repressed 
demonstrations 
against 
repressive 
com-
munist governments in Hungary in 1956, 
Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Poland in 1980; 
Whereas the United States Congress played 
a crucial role in the founding of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty, independent and 
uncensored news outlets that broadcast be-
hind the Iron Curtain and have been credited 
by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
and former Czech President Vaclav Havel 
with playing a significant role in the ending 
of the Cold War; 
Whereas, in West Berlin in 1987, President 
Ronald Reagan, standing at the Brandenburg 
Gate, symbolically referred to both the phys-
ical wall and the division of the world and 
implored Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev 
to ‘‘tear down this Wall!’’; 
Whereas President Reagan stated, ‘‘As long 
as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of 
a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the 
German question alone that remains open, 
but the question of freedom for all man-
kind.’’; 
Whereas, on August 23, 1989, several mil-
lion people across the Baltic States of Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which were ille-
gally annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union, 
demonstrated bravery and resilience by join-
ing hands to form a 500-kilometer long 
human chain to peacefully demand their 
independence; 
Whereas, at midnight on November 9, 1989, 
the Berlin Wall symbolically fell, and East 
Berliners were allowed to cross into the 
West; 
Whereas, that night, East Berliners took 
pickaxes to this hated symbol of oppression, 
and during the following three days more 
than 2,000,000 people visited West Berlin from 
the East; 
Whereas, on November 13, 1989, the United 
States Senate welcomed ‘‘the opening of the 
Berlin Wall as symbolic of the beginning of 
the process of reform taking place in the 
German Democratic Republic (East Ger-
many) and throughout Eastern Europe’’; 
Whereas, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
a wave of democratic governance swept the 
world; 
Whereas, by the summer of 1990, democrat-
ically elected governments had been formed 
in all former Warsaw Pact countries; 
Whereas the reunification of Germany was 
officially declared on October 3, 1990; 
Whereas the process of German reunifica-
tion faced significant economic, structural, 
cultural, and political challenges both with-
in Germany and in Europe and took dedi-
cated political leaders and citizens, with the 
support of allied nations, over a decade to 
achieve; 
Whereas, on December 25, 1991, the Soviet 
flag was lowered from over the Kremlin for 
the final time, replaced by the Russian flag; 
Whereas Mr. Gorbachev later said, ‘‘The 
Soviet model was defeated not only on the 
economic and social levels; it was defeated 
on a cultural level. Our society, our people, 
the most educated, the most intellectual, re-
jected that model on the cultural level be-
cause it does not respect the man, oppresses 
him spiritually and politically.’’; 
Whereas, since its reunification, Germany 
has become the world’s fourth largest econ-
omy, has served as a leading voice in the Eu-
ropean Union (EU), the Group of 7, and the 
United Nations, and has been consistently 
rated by Freedom House as one of the 
world’s freest countries; 
Whereas the United States and Germany 
share a close and multidimensional relation-
ship, including security cooperation and an 
economic and trade partnership; 
Whereas the United States and Germany 
share values of freedom, democracy, and 
human rights and work in tandem to support 
and uphold these three pillars globally; 
Whereas Germany demonstrated uncondi-
tional solidarity with the United States fol-
lowing the September 11, 2001, attacks and lead-
ership within NATO during the invocation of 
Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty in rec-
ognition that an attack on one is an attack on 
all; 
Whereas the 30th anniversary of the fall of 
the Berlin Wall coincides with the 70th anni-
versary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation (NATO) and the 15th anniversary of 
the European Union ‘‘Big Bang’’, when 10 
mostly post-communist countries joined the 
EU’s community of democracies; 
Whereas many former Soviet and com-
munist countries are prospering as a result 
of their democratic and economic reforms, 
reflected in their memberships in the EU and 
NATO; and 
Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall sig-
nified the end of the division of Europe and, 
ultimately, the triumph of democracy over 
communism: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the 
fall of the Berlin Wall as the start of German 
reunification and democratic change in East-
ern Europe and much of the rest of the 
world; 
(2) values the significant efforts made by 
German and European citizens to reunify 
and reinvigorate a united Germany; 
(3) recognizes Germany for its steadfast al-
liance and friendship with the United States, 
its leadership within the European Union, its 
commitment to democracy, rule of law, and

amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to the preamble to strike the pre-
amble and insert the part printed in 
italic, as follows: 
S. RES. 447 
Whereas Evo Morales was elected as the first 
indigenous president of Bolivia in 2005; 
Whereas, in 2009, Bolivians approved by a 
vote of more than 60 percent in a nationwide 
referendum a new constitution that established 
a limit of two 5-year presidential terms and de-
clared the country a plurinational state in order 
to better reflect Bolivia’s dozens of ethnic 
groups; 
Whereas, in 2009 and 2014, President Morales 
won re-election to a second and third term in of-
fice with more than 60 percent of the vote; 
Whereas, in 2016, 51.3 percent of Bolivian vot-
ers rejected a national referendum on the pro-
posal by the Administration of President Mo-
rales to lift presidential term limits; 
Whereas, in 2017, despite the results of the 
2016 national referendum, President Morales’ 
political allies in the Bolivian Constitutional 
Tribunal removed presidential term limits; 
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, amid existing 
concerns over the politicization of Bolivia’s elec-
toral commission, Bolivian voters went to the 
polls for general elections to choose a new presi-
dent, members of the Senate, and members of the 
Chamber of Deputies; 
Whereas, at the invitation of Morales Admin-
istration, the Organization of American States 
(OAS) General Secretariat sent an Electoral Ob-
servation Mission to Bolivia that was comprised 
of 92 experts and observers from 24 different na-
tionalities deployed in the country’s nine de-
partments and in three countries in which Bo-
livian expatriates could cast their votes abroad; 
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, Bolivian elec-
toral authorities stopped reporting the prelimi-
nary vote count for a period of 20 hours, subse-
quently announced preliminary results that ne-
gated the need for a second-round election, and 
Evo Morales proclaimed himself the winner of 
the presidential election; 
Whereas, on October 21, 2019, the OAS Elec-
toral Observation Mission in Bolivia expressed 
‘‘deep concern and surprise at the drastic and 
hard-to-explain change in the trend of the pre-
liminary results revealed after the closing of the 
polls’’; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of the October 20, 
2019, general elections, violent protests occurred 
throughout Bolivia in response to electoral 
irregularities and the findings of the OAS Elec-
toral Observation Mission; 
Whereas, on October 30, 2019, the Morales Ad-
ministration and the OAS General Secretariat 
signed an agreement to have the OAS conduct 
an audit of the integrity of the October 20, 2019, 
general elections; 
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, an OAS tech-
nical mission issued a report on its audit of the 
integrity of the October 20, 2019, general elec-
tions, which included findings that— 
(1) the preliminary and final election results 
were transmitted via a flawed computer trans-
mission system that was accessed by unauthor-
ized outside computer servers; 
(2) there was a deficient chain of custody for 
and significant irregularities in the electoral 
tally sheets and other electoral records; and 
(3) the audit team could not validate the re-
sults of the election and therefore recommended 
a new electoral process; 
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, President Mo-
rales acknowledged the results of the OAS tech-
nical mission, announced that he would call 
new elections, and stated that, ‘‘new national 
elections will allow the Bolivian people to demo-
cratically choose new authorities with their 
vote’’; 
Whereas, in the face of widespread public pro-
tests and a deteriorating security environment, 
President Morales departed Bolivia on November 
12, 2019, and was granted asylum by the Gov-
ernment of Mexico; 
Whereas, on November 12, 2019, the Bolivian 
Constitutional Tribunal recognized an interim 
president of Bolivia; 
Whereas the transitional government in Bo-
livia signed a law on November 24, 2019, stating 
that new elections must be held within 120 days 
after the election of a new Electoral Tribunal by 
the National Assembly; 
Whereas the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights (IACHR) stated that protests oc-
curring in Bolivia since the October 20, 2019, 
general election have left 23 people dead and 
more than 700 people injured; and 
Whereas the IACHR has urged the Bolivian 
state ‘‘to adopt all measures necessary to pre-
vent impunity, to protect the right to peaceful 
assembly, and to take urgent action to preserve 
Bolivians’ lives and integrity, as well as ensur-
ing that journalists and autonomous institu-
tions to protect and defend human rights can do 
their job’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses concern about the numerous 
irregularities that occurred during the October 
20, 2019, general elections in Bolivia; 
(2) commends the efforts of the OAS Electoral 
Observation Mission in Bolivia and supports the 
findings of the OAS electoral audit mission, 
which documented numerous irregularities dur-
ing the October 2019 general elections in Bolivia; 
(3) deplores the acts of violence that have oc-
curred in Bolivia in the aftermath of the Octo-
ber 20, 2019, general elections and urges all Bo-
livians to repudiate violence and to peacefully 
exercise their rights of freedom of expression 
and assembly; 
(4) urges Bolivia’s transitional government to 
work expeditiously to establish the conditions 
for an inclusive, credible, transparent, and 
democratic elections as soon as possible in ac-
cordance with their laws and constitution; 
(5) encourages the Bolivian state to protect 
the human rights of all persons, including in-
digenous groups, regardless of political affili-
ation, ethnicity, religion, or sex; 
(6) encourages the Department of State and 
the U.S. Mission to the Organization of Amer-

mittee-reported amendment to the pre-
amble be agreed to; that the preamble, 
as amended, be agreed to; and that the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was

The resolution (S. Res. 447), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment

The 
preamble, 
as

was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 447 
Whereas Evo Morales was elected as the 
first indigenous president of Bolivia in 2005; 
Whereas, in 2009, Bolivians approved by a 
vote of more than 60 percent in a nationwide 
referendum a new constitution that estab-
lished a limit of two 5-year presidential 
terms 
and 
declared 
the 
country 
a 
plurinational state in order to better reflect 
Bolivia’s dozens of ethnic groups; 
Whereas, in 2009 and 2014, President Mo-
rales won re-election to a second and third 
term in office with more than 60 percent of 
the vote; 
Whereas, in 2016, 51.3 percent of Bolivian 
voters rejected a national referendum on the 
proposal by the Administration of President 
Morales to lift presidential term limits; 
Whereas, in 2017, despite the results of the 
2016 national referendum, President Morales’ 
political allies in the Bolivian Constitu-
tional Tribunal removed presidential term 
limits; 
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, amid existing 
concerns over the politicization of Bolivia’s 
electoral commission, Bolivian voters went 
to the polls for general elections to choose a 
new president, members of the Senate, and 
members of the Chamber of Deputies; 
Whereas, at the invitation of Morales Ad-
ministration, the Organization of American 
States (OAS) General Secretariat sent an 
Electoral Observation Mission to Bolivia 
that was comprised of 92 experts and observ-
ers from 24 different nationalities deployed 
in the country’s nine departments and in 
three countries in which Bolivian expatri-
ates could cast their votes abroad; 
Whereas, on October 20, 2019, Bolivian elec-
toral authorities stopped reporting the pre-
liminary vote count for a period of 20 hours, 
subsequently announced preliminary results 
that negated the need for a second-round 
election, and Evo Morales proclaimed him-
self the winner of the presidential election; 
Whereas, on October 21, 2019, the OAS Elec-
toral Observation Mission in Bolivia ex-
pressed ‘‘deep concern and surprise at the 
drastic and hard-to-explain change in the 
trend of the preliminary results revealed 
after the closing of the polls’’; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of the October 
20, 2019, general elections, violent protests 
occurred throughout Bolivia in response to 
electoral irregularities and the findings of 
the OAS Electoral Observation Mission; 
Whereas, on October 30, 2019, the Morales 
Administration and the OAS General Secre-
tariat signed an agreement to have the OAS 
conduct an audit of the integrity of the Oc-
tober 20, 2019, general elections; 
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, an OAS 
technical mission issued a report on its audit 
of the integrity of the October 20, 2019, gen-
eral elections, which included findings that— 
(1) the preliminary and final election re-
sults were transmitted via a flawed com-
puter transmission system that was accessed 
by unauthorized outside computer servers; 
(2) there was a deficient chain of custody 
for and significant irregularities in the elec-
toral 
tally 
sheets 
and 
other 
electoral 
records; and 
(3) the audit team could not validate the 
results of the election and therefore rec-
ommended a new electoral process; 
Whereas, on November 10, 2019, President 
Morales acknowledged the results of the OAS 
technical mission, announced that he would

lum by the Government of Mexico; 
Whereas, on November 12, 2019, the Boliv-

Whereas the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights (IACHR) stated that pro-
tests occurring in Bolivia since the October 
20, 2019, general election have left 23 people 
dead and more than 700 people injured; and 
Whereas the IACHR has urged the Bolivian 
state ‘‘to adopt all measures necessary to 
prevent impunity, to protect the right to 
peaceful assembly, and to take urgent action 
to preserve Bolivians’ lives and integrity, as 
well as ensuring that journalists and autono-
mous institutions to protect and defend 
human rights can do their job’’: Now, there-

CONDEMNING 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR ITS 
CONTINUED DETENTION OF SEN-
ATOR LEILA DE LIMA, CALLING 
FOR HER IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 365, Senate Res. 142. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 142) condemning the 
Government of the Philippines for its contin-
ued detention of Senator Leila De Lima, 
calling for her immediate release, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and an amendment to 
strike the preamble and insert the part 
printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas extrajudicial killings perpetrated by 
the Government of the Philippines as part of a 
government-directed antidrug campaign present 
the foremost human rights challenge in the 
Philippines; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2017 
Human Rights Report notes numerous human 
rights concerns, including the persecution of 
human rights defenders and the detention of po-
litical prisoners in the Philippines, stating, 
‘‘The most significant human rights issues in-
cluded: killings by security forces, vigilantes 
and others allegedly connected to the govern-
ment, and by insurgents; torture and abuse of 
prisoners and detainees by security forces; often 
harsh and life threatening prison conditions; 
warrantless arrests by security forces and cases 
of apparent government disregard for legal 
rights and due process; political prisoners; 
killings of and threats against journalists; offi-
cial corruption and abuse of power; threats of 
violence against human rights activists; violence 
against women; and forced labor.’’; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2018 
Human Rights report notes numerous human 
rights concerns in the Philippines, including 
‘‘unlawful or arbitrary killings by security 
forces, vigilantes, and others allegedly con-
nected to the government, and by insurgents; 
forced disappearance; torture; arbitrary deten-
tion; harsh and life-threatening prison condi-
tions; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful 
interference with privacy; criminal libel; killings 
of and threats against journalists; official cor-
ruption and abuse of power; and the use of 
forced and child labor’’; 
Whereas, on February 23, 2017, an arrest war-
rant was issued for Philippine Senator Leila De 
Lima for allegations related to drug trafficking, 
and as of April 4, 2019, Senator De Lima had 
been detained for 770 days; 
Whereas the charges brought against Senator 
De Lima followed a history of criticizing 
extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and the 
Rodrigo R. Duterte administration’s antidrug 
campaign, including— 
(1) in 2009, in her capacity as Chair of the 
Commission on Human Rights, Senator De Lima 
investigated the alleged involvement of then- 
Mayor of Davao City Rodrigo R. Duterte in the 
extrajudicial killings executed by the so-called 
‘‘Davao Death Squad’’; 
(2) on December 15, 2014, then-Secretary of 
Justice De Lima led a raid of the national peni-
tentiary which resulted in the confiscation of 
drugs, firearms, and contraband items and the 
extraction of 19 drug lords and high-profile in-
mates involved in the facility’s drug network; 
(3) on July 13, 2016, Senator De Lima, in her 
capacity as Chair of the Senate Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights, filed Senate Resolu-
tion No. 9 calling for an investigation into 
extrajudicial killings and summary executions of 
suspected drug offenders arising from President 
Duterte’s ‘‘War on Drugs’’; 
(4) on August 22, 2016, Senator De Lima con-
ducted Senate hearings during which alleged 
former 
death 
squad 
members 
detailed 
extrajudicial killings executed as part of the 
antidrug campaign and one member testified 
that 
Duterte 
participated 
in 
extrajudicial 
killings as mayor of Davao City; and 
(5) on August 2, 2016, and September 19, 2016, 
Senator De Lima delivered two privileged 
speeches on the Senate floor calling on Presi-
dent Duterte to end the killings; 
Whereas President Duterte vowed to publicly 
destroy Senator De Lima; 
Whereas the charges against Senator De Lima 
were supported by testimony from inmates 
whose illegal activities were disrupted by her 
2014 raid; 
Whereas the United Nations Human Rights 
Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Deten-
tion adopted an Opinion on August 24, 2018, 
finding several categories of arbitrary detention 
and concluding, ‘‘Ms. De Lima’s political views 
and convictions are clearly at the centre of the 
present case and that the authorities have dis-
played an attitude towards her that can only be 
characterized as targeted and discriminatory. 
Indeed, she has been the target of partisan per-
secution and there is no explanation for this 
other than her exercise of the right to express 
such views and convictions as a human rights 
defender.’’; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2017 
Human Rights Report highlighted due process 
obstructions in the case of Senator De Lima, 
stating, ‘‘During the year prosecutors used a va-
riety of legal tactics, including filing new and 
amending previous charges, to delay arraign-
ment.’’; 
Whereas the United Nations Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention recommended that the 
Government of the Philippines adopt certain 
measures, including— 
(1) the immediate release of Senator De Lima; 
(2) an independent investigation of the cir-
cumstances surrounding the arbitrary detention; 
and 
(3) the provision of compensation and other 
reparations, including reinstatement to the posi-
tions from which she was ousted; 
Whereas, on July 20, 2017, the Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission of the United States 
Congress held a hearing on The Human Rights 
Consequences of the War on Drugs in the Phil-
ippines, during which Human Rights Watch tes-
tified about the ‘‘relentless government cam-
paign’’ against Senator De Lima ‘‘in evident re-
sponse to her outspoken criticism of Duterte’s 
‘war on drugs’ and her calls for account-
ability’’; 
Whereas Amnesty International finds Senator 
De Lima’s detention to be based solely on her 
criticism of the Government of the Philippines, 
her political beliefs, and her peaceful defense of 
human rights, and considers her a Prisoner of 
Conscience; 
Whereas the immediate release of Senator De 
Lima has been called for by nongovernmental 
organizations, human rights groups, parliamen-
tary bodies, and individuals including the Euro-
pean Parliament, the Australian Parliament, 
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Amnesty Inter-
national, Human Rights Watch, Liberal Inter-
national, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human 
Rights, and many of Senator De Lima’s col-
leagues in the Senate minority bloc; 
Whereas Maria Ressa, an investigative jour-
nalist who founded the online news platform 
Rappler, has been arrested several times on 
charges against her and her news organization 
widely viewed by human rights observers and a 
number of governments as part of a pattern of 
‘‘weaponizing the rule of law’’ to repress inde-
pendent media; and 
Whereas Ms. Ressa has been released on bail, 
but she and Rappler still face charges and will 
soon be standing trial: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

Whereas, on August 15, 1948, the Provisional

Transpor-
tation. 
Mrs. FISCHER. I ask unanimous con-

Solomson, of Maryland, to be a Judge 
of the United States Court of Federal 
Claims for a term of fifteen years. 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
IRAN 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I begin 
by saying that my prayers are with our 
Armed Forces and their families. They 
stand watch despite the threat of dan-
ger, and they rely on their leaders to 
make wise decisions. I am grateful that 
there were no casualties during last 
night’s missile attack. 
For well over a year, I have been 
sounding the alarm that this President 
could bring us to war with Iran 
through mistake, misjudgment, or mis-
calculation. I have urged this body to 
assert our constitutional authority and 
pass our bipartisan bill to prevent a 
war with Iran. 
In 2018 and 2019, I introduced the Pre-
vention of Unconstitutional War with 
Iran Act. In June of last year, my 
amendment to prevent unauthorized 
war earned bipartisan majority support 
in the Senate, and it passed in the 
House of Representatives. It may not 
have become law, but the Constitution 
has not changed. Now, on the brink of 
war with Iran, it is long past time for 
Congress to step up to its constitu-
tional responsibilities and stop the 
march to an unauthorized war. 
Americans oppose another war in the 
Middle East. Despite the President’s 
claim to the contrary, war with Iran 
would certainly not ‘‘go very quickly.’’ 
That is what the President has said— 
‘‘go very quickly.’’ Any war with Iran 
would be prolonged, bloody, and costly. 
Yet, even if you support a war with 
Iran, we all swore an oath to uphold 
the Constitution, and Congress—and 
Congress 
alone—has 
the 
authority, 
under article I of the Constitution, to 
declare war. 
Any country would consider the 
President’s strike on one of Iran’s 
highest 
ranking 
military 
com-
manders—someone whom many con-
sider to be the second most powerful 
person in Iran’s Government—to be an 
act of war. Now, predictably, Iran has

January 8, 2020 
responded. So Congress must no longer 
hide from its constitutional responsi-
bility. 
If Congress does not stop the mili-
tary conflict with Iran, this President 
will continue to take a wrecking ball 
through the Middle East, making one 
impulsive decision after another while 
having no long-term plan or strategic 
goal in sight. The President’s speech 
made it clear he has no strategy to 
defuse the situation or to achieve a 
diplomatic result. He will continue the 
provocative warpath we are on. 
While we may now be in a period of 
relative calm, the position we are in is 
untenable, and it is because the Presi-
dent abandoned diplomacy and created 
this crisis. The administration did not 
consult Congress before carrying out 
the strike, which is something that, 
typically, an administration would do 
before carrying out a strike like this; 
it would have a true consultation with 
the top leaders in the Congress. The ad-
ministration did not consult our allies 
or try to form a coalition around what 
is clearly a highly provocative action 
that 
has 
ramifications 
for 
inter-
national security. 
This is kind of a reminder of the run- 
up to Iraq. What did that look like, the 
run-up to the Iraq war? Sketchy evi-
dence, bad intelligence, outright mis-
representations, and a call for venge-
ance against Saddam Hussein are what 
got us into the war in Iraq. This is 
where we are today in our conflict with 
Iran. The administration’s vague asser-
tions of an imminent threat, without 
its having concrete evidence, and its 
ever-changing story are too reminis-
cent of the origins of the war in Iraq. 
The echoes of Iraq are chilling. 
Congress, step up. Do your constitu-
tional duty. Rein in this reckless 
course we are on. 
Let me say this, not just to those of 
us in this body who are speaking up but 
also to the thousands across the coun-
try who are marching against a rush to 
war: To speak out against a war with 
Iran is a patriotic activity, a patriotic 
duty. It is the right action to take, and 
it is the right thing to do. We are 
speaking up to stop this Nation from 
repeating the grave mistakes of the 
Iraq war. We are speaking up because 
we love this country, because we do not 
want to see another military family 
mourn a loved one who loses his life in 
a war that does not need to be fought 
and that we have the power to stop and 
to avoid. 
President Trump set this disastrous 
course in motion in May of 2018 when 
he unilaterally withdrew from the Iran 
nuclear agreement. This was a deal the 
international community stood firmly 
behind. It reminded everyone—Euro-
pean countries, Russia, and China— 
that we were all a part of this deal. 
That agreement took the single great-
est threat to the U.S. and international 
security—that 
being 
Iran—off 
the 
table. It prevented Iran from devel-
oping nuclear weapons. According to 
the International Atomic Energy Agen-
cy and President Trump’s military and 
national security experts, Iran was 
complying with the agreement when 
the President withdrew. 
The nuclear agreement did not solve 
all of the problems with Iran, but it is 
clear that the diplomatic effort re-
duced tensions with a longstanding ad-
versary and reduced the threat of hos-
tilities. Yet, instead of working to 
build on this progress, the President 
precipitously withdrew from the agree-
ment and began his maximum pressure 
campaign to force Iran to capitulate to 
a long list of impossible demands. The 
President promised he would get us a 
‘‘better deal.’’ That is what he said— 
get us a ‘‘better deal.’’ He has not. 
There is no better deal in sight. 
I call on the President and his admin-
istration to use all of their diplomatic 
tools to deescalate this threatening sit-
uation—a situation that risks Amer-
ican lives. I call on them to work with 
our allies to find a path back to the nu-
clear limits the international commu-
nity agreed to, to develop channels for 
productive communication and diplo-
macy, and to work toward stabilizing 
an unstable Middle East. 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Repub-
lican leadership must bring this debate 
to the Senate floor. Senator KAINE’s re-
cently filed War Powers Resolution is 
one step in that direction. Senator 
PAUL and I have called upon all Sen-
ators to support our Prevention of Un-
constitutional War with Iran Act. We 
must keep up this fight and block 
funds for any war with Iran in the ab-
sence of congressional authorization, 
and we must repeal the outdated au-
thorizations of force that are being 
abused—the one from 2001 and the one 
from 2002. 
I strongly support our oath to defend 
our Nation and the Constitution from 
any enemies, foreign and domestic, in-
cluding against a President who would 
take us to war without his having con-
stitutional authority. If we do not act 
now to preserve our constitutional 
structure and to assert our constitu-
tional authority, we fail the men and 
women in uniform whose lives we put 
at risk; we fail our oath to defend and 
protect the Constitution; and we fail 
the American people, who sent us here 
to represent them on the most con-
sequential decision our country can 
make. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
would like to take a few moments 
today to talk about the current situa-
tion with regard to Iran. 
First, the decision to take out Qasem 
Soleimani. Let’s remember who he was. 
He was leader of the Quds Force and 
the 
Islamic 
Revolutionary 
Guard 
Corps—both of these groups, by the 
way, having been designated as ter-
rorist organizations. 
He was responsible for providing the 
Shia militias in Iraq with explosively 
formed penetrators. What does that 
mean? These were the extremely dead-
ly improvised explosive devices—so- 
called roadside bombs—that were re-
sponsible for killing over 600 American 
soldiers and injuring many more, at 
least a couple thousand. 
Some of those maimed or killed were 
from my home State of Ohio. My heart 
goes out to their families for their sac-
rifice. 
I got a chance to see some of these 
brave Americans in visits to the 
Landstuhl military hospital in Ger-
many and the Walter Reed Hospital 
here in Washington, DC. We must never 
forget their courage and the sacrifices 
they and their families have made. 
Over 
the 
past 
2 
months 
alone, 
Soleimani helped direct more than 11 
attacks against our forces in Iraq. In 
fact, he was found recently to be plot-
ting more. When he was killed, he was 
plotting additional and imminent at-
tacks with the commander of the Shia 
militia—the same commander who di-
rected both the rocket strikes that 
killed the American contractor and 
wounded four American service per-
sonnel in Erbil and the demonstration 
and assault against the U.S. Embassy 
in Baghdad. 
Thankfully, that commander was 
taken off the battlefield as well. 
For reasons I have outlined, the kill-
ing of Qasem Soleimani was both le-
gitimate and justified. His history of 
fomenting terror and murdering inno-
cents goes back decades, and the world 
is a better place without him. 
Some of my Democratic colleagues 
have been critical of the President’s 
actions against Iran, to include the 
killing of Soleimani. Some argue that 
our actions have been unwarranted and 
belligerent. In fact, given the facts, I 
believe President Trump has shown re-
straint in the face of continued Iranian 
aggression over these past 18 months. 
By authorizing the killing of the 
leader of terrorist organizations that 
were actively plotting more violence 
against our brave men and women, I 
believe President Trump reset the con-
cept of deterrence and fulfilled his du-
ties as President. 
As GEN David Petraeus said after the 
Soleimani action, ‘‘This was a signifi-
cant effort to re-establish deterrence.’’ 
I 
would 
call 
that 
peace 
through 
strength. 
Last evening’s Iranian missile at-
tacks against our forces and air bases 
at Erbil and Al-Asad was a continu-
ation of the reckless and provocative 
approach. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
profes-
sionalism and capability of our Armed 
Forces, despite over a dozen Iranian 
missiles aimed their way, there were, 
fortunately, no American or allied 
troop or Iraqi casualties—amazing—

and there was only minimal damage to 
our bases. For that, of course, we are 
very thankful. 
I listened to President Trump this 
morning, and I agree that the max-
imum pressure campaign against Iran 
must continue, and it should include 
additional sanctions. 
There is a way forward for Iran to re-
join the international community rath-
er than continue to be a pariah and the 
top sponsor of state terrorism in the 
world. President Trump has said on 
many occasions he is willing to nego-
tiate with Iran if they cease their bel-
ligerent actions in the region and come 
to the table. 
We do not desire war with Iran, but 
we cannot and will not stand idly by as 
they continue to attack Americans, 
continue to kill our forces in the Mid-
dle East. 
I have been in meetings with top ad-
ministration officials today and yester-
day, and I look forward to continued 
discussions on their strategy moving 
forward. 
I will continue to pray for the safety 
of our men and women in uniform who 
are forward deployed, who put their 
lives in danger for all of us and do so 
for the sake of peace and stability. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
first want to say how relieved I am by 
reports that no lives were lost in last 
night’s missile strikes in Iraq and how 
grateful I am for all those serving in 
the region and around the world. 
The fact remains, however, that this 
is a volatile and frightening moment 
for our country. In a matter of days, 
the President of the United States has, 
without any authorization or notice, 
taken steps that have sent tensions 
soaring with Iran, threatened the fight 
against ISIS, jeopardized relationships 
with key allies, risked the safety of 
U.S. servicemembers and civilians, and 
brought us perilously close to war. 
I have heard from so many people in 
my home State of Washington, and I 
know my colleagues have as well, 
about just how scary and uncertain 
this feels and the many questions it 
raises. 
While there is no question Qasem 
Soleimani was a sworn enemy of the 
United States, people want to know 
whether the President’s initial order 
was truly necessary to our safety and 
why right now in this time of already 
heightened tensions in the Middle East. 
They want to know elected officials 
here 
in 
the 
Nation’s 
capital 
are 
prioritizing their safety and our coun-
try’s safety. Most of all, they want to 
know what comes next and what can be 
done to prevent things from getting 
worse. 
Like so many Americans, I have 
watched these events unfold with in-
creasing concern. As the daughter of a 
World War II veteran and Purple Heart 
recipient, I make decisions about the 
safety and security of our Nation with 
deep concern for our brave service-
members and their families, a personal 
understanding of the sacrifices they 
make for all of us and our Nation, and 
an unwavering commitment to ensur-
ing they have the support they need 
while they serve and when they come 
home. 
To that end, while I firmly believe we 
must do everything possible to keep 
America safe and go after terrorists 
wherever they are, I also believe that, 
except 
in 
the 
most 
dire 
of 
cir-
cumstances, we should do everything 
possible to exhaust all of our diplo-
matic avenues and coordinate with our 
allies and our partners before taking 
military action all on our own. 
I believe we should not enter a con-
flict without a very strong under-
standing of what we are trying to ac-
complish and what it will cost and that 
while America has every right to de-
fend itself, striking another country 
preemptively, without the strongest 
evidence of immediate danger, is a dra-
matic step with significant long-term 
implications that should not be done 
without a full debate and congressional 
support. 
Madam President, based on what we 
know now, the administration’s ac-
tions in Iraq failed on each of these 
counts. It has not made us safer, and 
our allies feel blindsided, especially be-
cause this strike puts them at risk too. 
There is no clear goal or clear-eyed 
understanding of the risks we have as-
sumed. There was absolutely zero de-
bate in this Congress and—unless you 
happened to be on the golf course with 
the President—absolutely no notifica-
tion that he planned to massively esca-
late tensions with a foreign power 
overnight. 
While, unfortunately, this is exactly 
the type of scenario many of us feared 
would arise from this President, I can’t 
say it is surprising. President Trump’s 
repeated reckless actions in the region, 
beginning with his decision to pull out 
of the Iran nuclear deal, have jeopard-
ized critical objectives, leaving us 
without any clear strategy for restor-
ing peace or protecting our troops and 
allies. We cannot assume Iran is done 
retaliating, and we must assume ISIS 
or other terrorists will take full advan-
tage of the increased instability in the 
region. 
In the face of challenges as serious as 
these, none of us in Congress, regard-
less of party, should be willing to just 
stand by and accept that our Nation’s 
foreign policy and safety could be up- 
ended by an impulsive late-night tweet. 
I certainly won’t. Instead, I will con-
tinue to demand that the President 
provide us his legal justification for his 
order, commit to coming before Con-
gress in advance of any further esca-
lating steps as this now plays out, and 
explain how he will manage the con-
sequences of his decision, with the goal 
of protecting Americans, our allies, 
and our interests. 
I will continue to advocate for strate-
gies that lead us toward safety and se-
curity rather than fan the flames. In 
the coming weeks, I look forward to 
voting in support of my colleague from 
Virginia, Senator KAINE’s War Powers 
Resolution, and I am very glad to be a 
cosponsor. This resolution would re-
assert congressional authority, block 
President Trump’s ability to start a 
war with Iran, and allow us to hear 
whatever case he may have before tak-
ing a vote on whether this is really the 
path we want our Nation to go down. 
I hope every one of our colleagues lis-
tens to the people across this country 
who do not want to find themselves in 
an avoidable war and who sent us here 
to act as an independent branch of gov-
ernment, not a rubberstamp for an in-
creasingly volatile administration. I 
hope they join us and support this reso-
lution. 
Madam President, finally, I will say 
that I voted against the war in Iraq be-
cause I felt the administration was 
asking us to send our brave men and 
women into harm’s way without clear 
plans or goals. Today, this President 
isn’t even asking. The goals and plans 
are even less clear, and the path ahead 
of us is very uncertain. 
Congress has the power to ensure a 
debate, press this administration for a 
strategy, and check their power if they 
do not present a compelling one. It is 
well past time we used it. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Arkansas. 
ANTI-SEMITISM 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, this 
holiday season, the ancient darkness of 
anti-Semitism cast a shadow over New 
York City during Hanukkah, the Fes-
tival of Lights. The New York Police 
Department recorded at least nine sep-
arate attacks against Jews—more than 
one attack for each day of Hanukkah. 
New attacks are reported seemingly on 
a daily basis. 
In Crown Heights, the site of deadly 
anti-Semitic 
riots 
incited 
by 
Al 
Sharpton in 1991, a group of men beat 
up an Orthodox Jew and attacked an-
other with a chair. 
In Williamsburg, another group ter-
rorized an elderly Jewish man on the 
street. ‘‘Jew, Hitler burned you,’’ one 
of the criminals reportedly said. ‘‘I’ll 
shoot you.’’ 
Just outside the city, in Rockland 
County, a man with a machete stormed 
a celebration in a rabbi’s home and in-
jured five worshippers, leaving two in 
critical condition. The family of one 
victim, Josef Neumann, says he may 
never wake up from his coma.

These heinous attacks are part of a 
growing storm of anti-Semitism that 
has made Jewish Americans fearful to 
worship and walk the streets in their 
own communities. They come in the 
wake of the deadly rampage at the ko-
sher market in Jersey City that left 
four innocent people dead, including a 
police detective, and of course they 
come in the wake of the deadliest anti- 
Semitic attack in our Nation’s history: 
the massacre of 11 Jews at the Tree of 
Life synagogue in Pittsburgh by a 
White supremacist. 
According to the FBI, our country 
suffered a 37-percent increase in anti- 
Semitic crimes between 2014 and 2018. 
According to the New York Police De-
partment, the city suffered a 26-percent 
increase in anti-Semitic crimes in the 
past year alone. That increase is 
alarming enough. So is the fact that 
most hate crimes reported in New York 
are crimes against Jews. While some of 
the increase is due to better reporting, 
much of it is not. 
Jewish Americans bear witness to 
this harsh reality. Anti-Semitism is an 
ancient hatred, and today it appears in 
new disguises. It festers on internet 
message boards and social media. It 
festers in so-called Washington think 
tanks like the Quincy Institute, an iso-
lationist, blame-America-first money 
pit for so-called ‘‘scholars’’ who have 
written that American foreign policy 
could be fixed if only it were rid of the 
malign influence of Jewish money. It 
festers even on elite college campuses, 
which incubate the radical boycott, di-
vestment, and sanctions movement—a 
movement to wage economic warfare 
against the Jewish State. These forms 
of anti-Semitism may be less bloody 
than street crime in New York, but 
they channel the same ancient hatred, 
the same conspiratorial and obsessive 
focus on the Jewish people. 
Anti-Semitic attacks are a symptom 
of a larger breakdown of public order in 
our major cities caused by politicians 
who are letting dangerous criminals 
roam our streets. 
While Jews were being attacked in 
New York City, a law went into effect 
eliminating pretrial detention and bail 
for most crimes, including serious 
crimes like stalking, arson, robbery, 
and even manslaughter and negligent 
homicide. This law was a gift to crimi-
nals just in time for the holidays. In 
some cases, it came with an actual gift. 
New York City’s criminal justice sys-
tem gives goodies like taxpayer-funded 
movie tickets to criminal suspects just 
for showing up to court—movie tickets 
for criminals. I wish I were joking, but 
the joke is on the law-abiding citizens 
of this Nation. 
These soft-on-crime politicians are 
doing their best to make crime pay in 
New York. Releasing criminals is the 
logical next step for the criminal-leni-
ency movement. 
Thanks to the new bail law, an esti-
mated 3,800 criminal suspects were re-
leased from New York jails before New 
Year’s Day. Many of those suspects 
were arrested for new offenses within 
hours—within hours—of their release. 
Case in point: On the sixth day of Ha-
nukkah, December 27, Tiffany Harris 
was arrested for attacking three Jew-
ish women in Crown Heights. She 
shouted ‘‘F-you Jews’’ as she slapped 
them in a rage. Despite the violent na-
ture of her crime, Harris was amaz-
ingly released without bail the very 
next day, December 28, the seventh day 
of Hanukkah. On the eighth day of Ha-
nukkah, Harris was arrested yet again 
for assault. She was released for a sec-
ond time the day after that and is in 
custody now only because she was ar-
rested for now a third time for failing 
to comply with a court order. 
I can only imagine how demoralizing 
it must be for New York’s police offi-
cers to arrest a violent criminal, only 
to risk their safety arresting them the 
next day for harming somebody else 
and the next day and the next day. How 
terrifying it must be for the witnesses 
of those crimes to contemplate giving 
evidence while the criminals they wit-
nessed stalk the streets the very next 
day. And how enraging it must be for 
New York’s Jews to suffer constant 
anti-Semitic attacks and know that 
the perpetrators will slide through a 
revolving door from the lockup back 
into their communities to spread more 
of their virulent, anti-Semitic hatred. 
Soft-on-crime politicians claim that 
cash bail and strong policing punish 
the poor, but is there a worse punish-
ment for poor communities than flood-
ing them with dangerous criminals, 
making them unlivable for many law- 
abiding Americans who call those 
neighborhoods 
home? 
Guess 
what. 
Those dangerous criminals aren’t going 
back to live in fancy penthouses in the 
Upper East Side. They aren’t living be-
hind gated communities in Bethesda 
and Arlington. They are living in the 
very communities that most need po-
licing. That is why the consequences of 
criminal leniency never fall on the rich 
elites who praise it the most. Instead, 
the consequences fall on the less fortu-
nate and on the brave officers who are 
duty-bound to uphold the law, even as 
they receive less and less support from 
the political class. 
The real solution to disorder in our 
cities is the same as it always has 
been: more and better policing. New 
York’s finest and police officers all 
across the country have broken crime 
waves in the past using steely resolve 
and superior force. They can do it 
again, if only we give them the freedom 
and support they need. 
Thankfully, most Americans know 
whose side we are on in the fight 
against crime. We stand with cops, not 
criminals. We stand for the Jewish peo-
ple against the ancient hatred that 
stalks them even to this day. 
America liberated Nazi death camps 
in World War II, and we have served as 
a haven for persecuted Jews for longer 
than that. We must not allow the big-
otry so common in Europe and the 
Middle East to spread here to our free 
shores. We must not allow our city 
streets to be plunged into the lawless-
ness of the not so distant past. 
IRAN 
Madam President, I want to com-
mend our brave troopers and our intel-
ligence officers and the President for 
the daring strike last week on Qasem 
Soleimani. Qasem Soleimani had the 
blood of thousands of Americans on his 
hands, and he was plotting to kill more 
Americans just like his terrorist prox-
ies had killed in Iraq on December 27. 
He even was picked up, when he landed 
at Baghdad International Airport, by a 
terrorist culpable for the bombing of 
our Embassy in Kuwait in 1983. 
You 
would 
think 
that 
everyone 
would celebrate the death of a terrorist 
monster, but, no, you would be wrong. 
You would be wrong. Our Democratic 
friends have been criticizing and com-
plaining ever since Qasem Soleimani 
died Thursday night. 
Two 
particularly 
surprising 
com-
plaints I have heard are that the Demo-
crats weren’t notified in advance and 
that Qasem Soleimani’s plot wasn’t im-
minent. Let’s think about those criti-
cisms. 
The Speaker of the House and the mi-
nority leader weren’t notified in ad-
vance 
of 
a 
target 
of 
opportunity 
against a terrorist mastermind. I am 
sorry, but what did you expect? Is the 
President or Secretary of Defense or 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
supposed to call hours in advance when 
they don’t even know if the target will 
show up where our intelligence ex-
pects? 
Were they supposed to call when the 
missile was in the air? Give me a 
break. Give me a break. 
I will share what the majority leader 
told us yesterday about the raid on 
Osama bin Laden. Do you think he got 
notified in advance? No. Did he expect 
to be notified in advance? No. He said 
the Secretary of Defense called him 
after the strike to give him a brief 
summary of what had happened, and 
the majority leader, in 2011, simply 
said: ‘‘Congratulations.’’ He put out a 
public statement to the exact same ef-
fect. Where is that sense of patriotism 
and pride from the Speaker of the 
House and from the minority leader 
today with the elimination of Qasem 
Soleimani? 
Second, this critique that, well, 
Qasem Soleimani wasn’t plotting an 
imminent attack—I mean, we are talk-
ing about how many terrorists can 
dance on the head of a pin here. Qasem 
Soleimani had been killing Americans 
for 30 years. He was flying around the 
Middle East to meet with his terrorist 
proxies in Syria and Lebanon and Iraq 
to plan how to kill more Americans. 
We just had a briefing downstairs 
with the Director of the CIA and the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of 
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff in which they said: Yes, 
the plot was imminent. Intelligence is 
never ironclad, though. It can rarely 
say a strike is going to happen at this

time on this day at this target. That is 
apparently the standard the Democrats 
want to hold the President to—not 
weeks, not even days, not even a period 
of days against a hard target that pre-
sented 
an 
opportunity, 
as 
Qasem 
Soleimani did last Thursday night. 
Let me say this: Imminence is ulti-
mately a question of judgment that has 
to be made by the people we have elect-
ed to make those decisions for our 
country. It is not a question of intel-
ligence. Our intelligence officers have 
great skills and capabilities. They can 
tell us the best intelligence they have 
that suggests the timing of such at-
tacks. But it is ultimately the people’s 
elected 
representatives 
who 
make 
those judgments. 
I will just submit that if you are a 
soldier sitting in Iraq with Qasem 
Soleimani flying around trying to de-
cide when to kill you, the question of 
imminence probably looks a lot dif-
ferent than if you are a comfortable 
Senator sitting behind guarded doors 
with armed security details protecting 
your every movement. 
I will simply say yet again that 
Qasem Soleimani got exactly what he 
deserved. All those Americans he killed 
and their families also got what they 
deserved: justice. America and the 
world are a safer place because Qasem 
Soleimani is no longer a part of this 
world.

REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, Kay 
Hagan was a kind and passionate pub-
lic servant. She fought from the heart 
for 
women, 
children, 
students, 
servicemembers, and working people in 
North Carolina and across the country. 
In 2013, when interest rates on Fed-
eral student loans were about to double 
so that the government could increase 
profits off of the backs of our students, 
Kay said no. Together, with our col-
league Senator JACK REED, we put for-
ward commonsense legislation to keep 
interest rates low for students across 
the country. In this instance and so 
many others, Kay stood for fairness 
and served as a voice for those who 
needed it most. 
Kay and I may not have agreed on 
every issue, but on those key issues 
that matter to working families—like 
equal pay, raising the minimum wage, 
and helping students getting crushed 
by debt—we were proud to fight side by 
side. 
My thoughts are with her husband 
Chip, their children and family, and 
the people of North Carolina as they 
mourn Kay’s loss and celebrate her 
memory. 
REMEMBERING CORPORAL FRED 
B. MCGEE 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor a heroic Ohio veteran 
whom we lost this month, CPL Fred B. 
McGee. 
Corporal 
McGee 
served 
in 
Korea, where he and his squad leader 
were both wounded in the bloody Bat-
tle of Hill 528. 
With his leader down, and despite his 
own injuries, Corporal McGee took 
command—he wasn’t next in line, but 
he stepped up, and he saved lives. He 
was hit again, and his squad was given 
the order to withdraw. Yet still, with 
shrapnel in the face and leg, he volun-
tarily remained behind to evacuate his 
fellow soldiers who were wounded and 
killed. His acts of bravery earned Cor-
poral McGee a Silver Star and two Pur-
ple Hearts. 
For too long, he did not receive the 
recognition he earned serving our 
country. Like so many veterans, Cor-
poral McGee rarely spoke about his 
service and never drew attention to his 
own courage. While recalling the battle 
earlier this year he said, ‘‘No, I’m not 
brave. I just did what was a necessity.’’ 
And in the 1950s, the color of his skin 
surely also contributed to the lack of 
recognition for Corporal McGee’s her-
oism. He was drafted in 1951 into a 
newly integrating Army and was one of 
the first African-American soldiers to 
serve in Korea. Jefferson County’s 
sheriff talked about how someone made 
a comic book in 1953 illustrating 10 sto-
ries of soldiers’ heroics, they depicted 
Corporal McGee as a White man. 
We owe a hero like Corporal McGee a 
tribute that befits his service and sac-
rifice. At the end of last year, the Jef-
ferson County Veterans Service Com-
mission honored Corporal McGee as its 
Veteran of the Year. And I ask all my 
colleagues to join me in honoring him 
on the Senate floor today. 
We thank CPL Fred McGee for his 
heroism and his sacrifices for our coun-
try and we send our thoughts to Cor-
poral McGee’s family. May the tributes 
from the many lives he touched bring 
you comfort, and know that we will 
keep alive the story of his heroism. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM MOEN, JR. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a member of my 
staff in the great State of New Jersey. 
We are all fortunate to have offices full 
of staff members passionate about 
working for the betterment of our 
country. William Moen, Jr., or Bill 
Moen, as we affectionately call him, is 
a shining example of what patriotism 
looks like in government service. 
The son of a disabled Vietnam vet-
eran and the grandson of a WWII vet-
eran, Bill Moen’s commitment to pub-
lic service is a family legacy. 
Even prior to his Federal work in my 
Senate office in Camden, NJ, Bill has 
worked at all levels of government in 
New Jersey. Hes interned at his local 
police department and the First Con-
gressional District of New Jersey. He 
worked in the New Jersey State Legis-
lature, with the Gloucester County 
Board of Chosen Freeholders and even 
as an elected Freeholder himself in 
Camden County. 
On December 9, 2013, I welcomed Bill 
Moen to my staff in Camden, NJ. Bill 
was with me on one of my first official 
events as U.S. Senator. He helped orga-
nize a visit to Cape May County—the 
southernmost county in New Jersey— 
where I spoke with residents who were 
still struggling to recover from the 
devastation of Superstorm Sandy. The 
past 6 years are full of memorable 
events, stories, projects, and cases like 
this one. He has managed my South 
Jersey office with compassion and in-
tegrity. 
Mr. President, I wish to recognize 
Bill Moen today because he is leaving 
my office to set up his own as assem-
blyman 
representing 
New 
Jersey’s 
Fifth Legislative District in the New 
Jersey State Assembly. I am sad to see 
him go but grateful for his work and 
proud of the new role he begins in what 
will surely be a long and brilliant ca-
reer in public service.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING EARNIE BLACKLEY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life of Izard County 
Sheriff 
Earnie 
Blackley. 
Sheriff 
Blackley passed away on January 4, 
2020, after a brief battle with cancer. 
He first joined the Izard County 
Sheriff’s Department in 1993 after hav-
ing previously worked as a police offi-
cer in Greenville, MS, and served as 
chief deputy for 18 years before being 
elected sheriff in 2018. 
Sheriff Blackley was a dedicated law 
enforcement official; a devoted hus-
band, father, and grandfather; and a 
man of faith. His obituary noted how 
he was known for hosting fish fries to 
benefit a variety of causes and organi-
zations. The outpouring of love and 
support shown to the sheriff and his 
family since his diagnosis is a testa-
ment to how well he served his commu-
nity and how much that service was 
recognized and appreciated by all it 
impacted. 
After being diagnosed with stage 4 
lung cancer in May of last year, Sheriff 
Blackley asked for prayers as he faced 
this serious diagnosis head on while 
also continuing to serve. Over 1,000 
people reportedly turned out to a fund-
raiser in his honor shortly thereafter. 
Sheriff Blackley was clearly a leader 
who inspired love, confidence, and re-
spect. I am tremendously grateful for 
his decades of service in law enforce-
ment and for the way he lived his life. 
I join with many in his community 
and across the State of Arkansas in 
mourning his passing and praying for 
his loved ones, including his wife The-
resa, during this difficult time. On be-
half of everyone in Arkansas, I pray

TRIBUTE TO DANA BENNETT 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I come forward today to recognize the 
career and service of Ms. Dana Ben-
nett, who will soon retire as president 
of the Nevada Mining Association. Ms. 
Bennett is the first woman to lead the 
Nevada Mining Association, serving as 
the State industry’s educational and 
advocacy leader, as well as its chief 
representative in national and inter-
national outreach. As we commemo-
rate her retirement, her countless con-
tributions to the great State of Nevada 
are worthy of recognition. 
Ms. Bennett began her career of serv-
ice to Nevada as a principal research 
analyst with the Nevada Legislative 
Counsel 
Bureau, 
LCB, 
where 
she 
worked with both parties and com-
mittee staff in the State senate and as-
sembly for over 9 years. One of her 
more notable achievements during her 
time at the LCB was identifying an 
error in the 1929 bill that established 
the design of the Nevada State flag. 
Ms. Bennett’s sleuthing resulted in a 
design change to the Nevada State flag, 
ensuring that it fully complied with 
the law and producing the flag that we 
still proudly fly today. 
In 1998, Ms. Bennett left the LCB to 
start her own legislative and policy re-
search services company. She went on 
to represent such clients as the Nevada 
Broadcasters Association, the Nevada 
State Medical Association, the Associ-
ated General Contractors of Las Vegas, 
and many more. Ms. Bennett success-
fully ran this company, Research by 
Design, from 1998 to 2004, before being 
offered the position of director of gov-
ernment affairs at R&R Partners—one 
of Nevada’s premiere public relations 
and government affairs firms. 
In 2006, Ms. Bennett left R&R to pur-
sue a graduate degree at Arizona State 
University, ASU. During her time in 
graduate school, Ms. Bennett served as 
a policy analyst at the Morrison Insti-
tute for Public Policy; a research as-
sistant at the ASU School of Histor-
ical, Philosophical and Religious Stud-
ies; and a research historian at the Ari-
zona State Archives. 
In January 2011, Ms. Bennett re-
turned to Nevada to once again serve, 
this time as senior researcher for Gov-
ernor Sandoval, eventually becoming 
the Northern Nevada regional director 
for the Governor’s Office of Economic 
Development. As regional director, Ms. 
Bennett was a catalyst in the overhaul 
and redevelopment of that State agen-
cy, where she created the new State 
plan for excellence in economic devel-
opment and worked to improve col-
laboration between the State and its 
regional development authorities to 
better facilitate economic growth in 
Nevada. 
In December 2014, Ms. Bennett was 
named president of the Nevada Mining 
Association. Through this role, Ms. 
Bennett has worked tirelessly to advo-
cate for the mining industry in Nevada 
and educate people about the impor-
tance of mining and its impact on both 
the State and global economies. From 
her time at LCB, to becoming the first 
woman President of the Nevada Mining 
Association, Ms. Bennett has been a 
trailblazer for women in Nevada, help-
ing break the glass ceiling in industries 
often dominated by men. 
Through all of Ms. Bennett’s incred-
ible work and public service, she has 
gained an intimate understanding of 
the policy and initiatives that aim to 
improve the lives of all Nevadans. It is 
my sincere hope that Ms. Bennett will 
continue to be an advocate for the peo-
ple of Nevada and their interests. 
Today, I celebrate the many contribu-
tions of Ms. Dana Bennett. Nevadans 
are fortunate to have had her leader-
ship, knowledge, and voice during her 
service to both the State and the coun-
try.∑

TRIBUTE TO JIM BYRUM 
∑ Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor someone who has 
dedicated his entire career to pro-
moting 
Michigan 
agriculture 
and 
someone I am proud to call my friend. 
I have always said that, in Michigan, 
we don’t have an economy unless we 
make things and grow things. For more 
than 40 years, Jim Byrum has been 
helping Michigan do just that. 
That is a big deal for our State. From 
West Michigan’s fruitbelt, to the for-
ests of Northern Michigan and the 
Upper Peninsula, to sugarbeet and dry 
bean fields in the Thumb, to biofuel 
production providing good jobs in rural 
communities, to dairy and food proc-
essing businesses in cities and towns of 
all sizes, agriculture is our State’s sec-
ond-largest industry, supporting one in 
four jobs. 
During his nearly 25 years with the 
Michigan Agri-Business Association, 
Jim has been a powerful advocate for 
those one in four jobs and for his orga-
nization’s more than 400 members. His 
vision, insight, hard work, and great 
sense of humor have played a strong 
role in the association’s success. 
It is no surprise that Jim knows ex-
actly what his members need; he has 
his own lifetime of experience to rely 
on. 
Jim is the fourth generation of 
Byrums to live on his family’s farm in 
Onondaga. Before he joined the Michi-
gan Agri-Business Association, he was 
State executive director of Michigan’s 
Farm Service Agency and executive di-
rector of the Michigan Bean Commis-
sion. 
Jim may be moving on, but the im-
print he has left on the agribusiness in-
dustry will live on. I know that Jim is 
particularly proud of the work he has 
done to expand markets internation-
ally and to build the Michigan Agri- 
Business Leader Program, which has 
been bringing together different sec-
tors of agriculture and training the 
next generation of leaders since 2008. 
I have been especially grateful for 
the culture of cooperation and biparti-
sanship Jim has helped cultivate in our 
State during a very challenging time 
for the industry. 
As Jim told Russ White of MSU 
Today back in September: ‘‘There’s 
going to be more change in the next 20 
years of this industry than there has 
been in the past 50. And that change is 
coming at light speed . . . it’s going to 
benefit consumers . . . it’s going to 
benefit producers . . . but folks better 
be ready to embrace it.’’ 
I know for a fact that Michigan’s ag-
ricultural industry is better positioned 
to embrace change thanks to Jim’s 
hard work and dedication. Speaking of 
change, I am so happy that Jim will 
have more time to spend with his wife 
Dianne, who is a leader in her own 
right, and his two children and grand-
children. 
Jim, thank you for your friendship, 
your leadership, and your lifetime of 
work on behalf of Michigan agri-
culture. It has been my honor to be 
your partner in helping Michigan make 
things and grow things. 
Thank you.∑

TRIBUTE TO WICK SLOANE 
∑ Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, it is 
my deep honor and privilege to cele-
brate the career and legacy of Massa-
chusetts 
resident, 
Wick 
Sloane 
of 
Bunker Hill Community College, or 
BHCC, as he retires this year. 
Wick Sloane came to BHCC in 2006 
and retires this year from his ‘‘official’’ 
job of helping students transfer to 4- 
year colleges. Wick leaves behind an 
unwavering commitment to the stu-
dents—from their success in the class-
room to ensuring that all of their basic 
needs are met. 
Wick has worked tirelessly over the 
years to address even the most basic 
needs of low-income students, like stu-
dent hunger and homelessness. His 
work touched the BHCC community in 
Massachusetts but also college commu-
nities far beyond BHCC throughout 
Massachusetts and across the country. 
Due in large part to Wick’s steadfast 
advocacy and voice, I successfully led 
several of my Senate colleagues in re-
questing 
the 
Government 
Account-
ability Office, or GAO, to conduct a 
study on food insecurity at colleges 
and universities. The GAO agreed to 
complete the study, which it published 
in January 2019. The groundbreaking 
study confirmed that food insecurity is 
a widespread issue on American college 
campuses and made recommendations 
for Federal action to address hunger 
issues for students in higher education. 
This study led lawmakers at the local 
level and at the national level—myself 
included—to introduce legislation to 
address hunger on college campuses. 
Wick saw a problem impacting his 
community in Massachusetts and took 
action, resulting in immediate support

for our most vulnerable students in the 
BHCC community and Federal action 
that will begin to create change for 
millions of vulnerable students across 
this country. 
Wick was one of the first BHCC pro-
fessors to teach late-night classes 
through the college’s nationally recog-
nized Midnight Classes Program. In 
2017, Wick’s contributions were recog-
nized by Governor Baker, who awarded 
him the Manuel Carballo Governor’s 
Award for Excellence in Public Service. 
As Wick retires, we thank him for his 
years of service at Bunker Hill Commu-
nity College and to students across the 
Commonwealth. I know Wick will keep 
fighting on behalf of our students in 
Massachusetts and beyond as he begins 
this next chapter.∑

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. HASSAN): 
S. 3155. A bill to establish a rural 
postsecondary and economic develop-
ment grant program; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Success for 
Rural Students and Communities Act, 
a bill that would help rural students 
achieve their higher education goals 
and connect their successes with eco-
nomic opportunities in their own com-
munities. I want to thank Senator 
HASSAN for introducing this bill with 
me. 
The Success for Rural Students and 
Communities Act aims to improve the 
outcomes for rural students who are 
pursuing higher education and skills- 
based credentials that will prepare 
them to meet the workforce needs of 
their home communities. 
According to the 2010 census, Maine 
is now the most rural State in the Na-
tion. Two out of three Maine schools 
are in rural communities, and more 
than half of Maine’s students attend 
those schools. While nearly 90 percent 
of the students in my State graduate 
from high school, only 62 percent enroll 
in higher education, at least right 
away. According to a recent report by 
the Maine Department of Economic 
and Community Development, only 30 
percent of Maine students go on to 
earn a 2-year or a 4-year degree. So we 
have a huge dichotomy between the 
number of Maine students who grad-
uate from high school and the number 
who are successful in graduating from 
some sort of higher education. 
Maine’s 
experience 
reflects 
the 
trends observed nationwide. Rural stu-
dents tend to graduate from high 
school at higher rates than their peers 
in urban districts and at about the 
same rate as their peers in suburban 
schools, but only 59 percent of rural 
graduates enroll in college upon grad-
uation, which is a lower percentage 
than their counterparts in urban and 
suburban areas. 
The Success for Rural Students and 
Communities Act would help spur inno-
vation, investment, and strategies that 
would improve college access and suc-
cess for rural students. It would create

a demonstration program to encourage 
rural community stakeholders to part-
ner together to help students go on to 
college or obtain some other postsec-
ondary education, complete this edu-
cation, and enter the workforce. These 
partnerships would draw on the talents 
of local school districts, institutions of 
higher education, regional economic 
development entities, rural community 
organizations, and the private sector. 
The bill encourages these partnerships 
to develop and implement strategies to 
help students and their families navi-
gate higher education opportunities 
and addresses the barriers to their 
achievement. 
For example, the bill calls for part-
nerships to coalesce around approaches 
that boost higher education enrollment 
rates for referral students by exposing 
students and their families to college 
campuses, courses, internships, and ca-
reer pathways to jobs at home. These 
partnerships could also focus on rural 
incompletion rates of nontraditional 
students who may need additional cre-
dentials or who once began but did not 
finish higher education. 
To meet the demands of today’s 
workforce, many employees will need a 
credential beyond a high school di-
ploma—perhaps a college degree, a 
skilled trade credential, or a profes-
sional certificate. The Success for 
Rural Students and Communities Act 
encourages schools and employers to 
forge partnerships that will put stu-
dents on pathways into the high-de-
mand jobs available where they live. 
That helps the rural communities. It 
helps them keep their young people. It 
helps them keep people who have the 
education and the skills those commu-
nities need to be vibrant and successful 
and to have strong economies. 
The bill highlights a number of strat-
egies that could be developed and test-
ed, including work-based learning op-
portunities, such as apprenticeships, 
internships, and stackable credentials 
that make up a sequence of courses on 
the path to a certain skill or job. I 
have toured apprenticeship programs 
in Maine, including one that helps to 
train people for jobs in forestry, and I 
have seen firsthand how successful 
those apprenticeship programs are. 
When rural students enroll in college, 
they often face barriers that prevent 
them from graduating, and that is why 
I have been a big promoter of student 
success programs. I have seen a very ef-
fective one at the Eastern Maine Com-
munity College in Bangor, where stu-
dents are helped with whatever the 
barrier is that is preventing them from 
completing 
community 
college. 
In 
some cases, it is the need for some 
mentoring; in others, tutoring in some 
areas. In other cases, it is simply a 
short-term loan in order for them to fix 
their automobile so they can get to 
class. In another case, it is childcare 
needs. Whatever the barrier is, if we 
can help these students, they will be 
able to complete their education. 
Many are the first in their families 
to attend college, which means they 
may have a more difficult time finding 
information about financial aid or se-
lecting an education program that 
meets their needs. With the right sup-
ports in place, more and more rural 
students can complete their postsec-
ondary education. 
Let me give a great example of the 
type of program I am talking about 
that would fulfill the goals of this leg-
islation. In Maine’s Aroostook County, 
where I was born and raised and where 
much of my family still lives, the 
Aroostook Aspirations Initiative is 
using this kind of model to help put 
students on pathways to academic and 
career success. Launched with a gen-
erous 
donation 
from 
local 
philan-
thropic partners, Aroostook Aspira-
tions provides scholarships to high 
school students in Aroostook County 
who are seeking postsecondary edu-
cation. The initiative collaborates with 
local colleges and universities, includ-
ing the University of Maine at Presque 
Isle, the University of Maine at Fort 
Kent, Northern Maine Community Col-
lege, and Husson University. It works 
with the area businesses and entre-
preneurs to offer seminars that guide 
students throughout their college edu-
cations—the kind of mentoring I was 
referring to. 
Students can also team up with 
Aroostook County employers through 
internships that give them experience 
in jobs they wish to pursue or simply 
try out to see if the jobs fit them. They 
create relationships with professional 
mentors, who help put them on the 
right path to entering the workforce. 
The Success for Rural Students and 
Communities Act would support dy-
namic programs such as the Aroostook 
Aspirations Initiative and encourage 
other communities in rural America to 
innovate in similar ways. The Success 
for Rural Students and Communities 
Act would make a meaningful invest-
ment in the educational aspirations of 
rural students and their families and 
would strengthen the economy in rural 
America. By helping students succeed 
in reaching their education and career 
goals, we can also enhance the skills of 
our workforce in rural America. I urge 
my colleagues to support the Collins- 
Hassan bill.

DEMNING THREATS BY PRESI-
DENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO VIO-
LATE THE LAW OF ARMED CON-
FLICT WITH RESPECT TO IRAN

MARKEY 
(for 
himself, 
Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. WAR-
REN, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, and Ms. HARRIS) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 465 
Whereas 
President 
Donald 
J. 
Trump 
threatened 
to 
destroy 
sites 
‘‘important 
to. . . the Iranian culture’’ and threatened 
future retaliation in ‘‘a disproportionate 
manner’’ on January 4 and January 5, 2020, 
respectively; 
Whereas Article 53 of Protocol I to the Ge-
neva Conventions prohibits any act of hos-
tility against cultural objects, including 
making such objects the target of reprisals; 
Whereas destruction of cultural sites vio-
lates the 1954 Hague Convention for the Pro-
tection of Cultural Property in the Event of 
Armed Conflict, which the United States 
ratified during the administration of Presi-
dent George W. Bush; 
Whereas the Department of Defense Law of 
War Manual states that ‘‘[c]ultural property, 
the areas immediately surrounding it, and 
appliances in use for its protection should be 
safeguarded and respected’’; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has condemned the Taliban, the Islamic 
State, al Qaeda and its affiliates, and the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, among others, for the destruction of 
cultural heritage; 
Whereas the Trump Administration sup-
ported the adoption of United Nations Secu-
rity Council Resolution 2347 (2017) con-
demning ‘‘the unlawful destruction of cul-
tural heritage, including the destruction of 
religious sites and artefacts’’; 
Whereas, on March 24, 2017, the United 
States Deputy Permanent Representative to 
the United Nations stated, ‘‘The United 
States seeks to hold accountable. . . the per-
petrators of deliberate cultural heritage de-
struction.’’; 
Whereas the destruction of cultural sites 
in Iran could include damage to one or more 
of the 22 cultural sites in Iran inscribed on 
the World Heritage List of the United Na-
tions Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2020, Secretary of 
Defense Mark T. Esper expressed that the 
United States would not target Iranian cul-
tural sites, as the United States ‘‘follow[s] 
the laws of armed conflict’’; 
Whereas military actions conducted ‘‘in a 
disproportionate 
manner’’ 
violate 
inter-
national law, including Protocol I to the Ge-
neva Conventions, as well as the United 
States Department of Defense guidelines 
whether in reference to the conduct of armed 
conflict or the resort to war; 
Whereas the Department of Defense Law of 
War Manual states that the principle of pro-
portionality in the conduct of war ‘‘gen-
erally refers to the obligation to take fea-
sible precautions in planning and conducting 
attacks and to refrain from attacks in which 
the expected loss of civilian life, injury to ci-
vilians, and damage to civilian objects inci-
dental to the attack would be excessive.’’; 
Whereas the Department of Defense Law of 
War Manual states, ‘‘Proportionality is also 
a requirement for reprisals, which must re-
spond in a proportionate manner to the pre-
ceding illegal act by the party against which 
they are taken’’; 
Whereas military action that disregards 
proportionality would further exacerbate the 
suffering of the Iranian people, who have en-
dured— 
(1) their own government’s systematic and 
longstanding human rights violations, re-
strictions on political freedoms, and brutal 
suppression of their democratic aspirations; 
and 
(2) the arbitrary reimposition of United 
States sanctions that have negatively af-
fected livelihoods of ordinary Iranians and 
restricted economic activity; and 
Whereas the destruction of cultural sites 
and the disproportionate use of military 
force are among the actions that could need-
lessly escalate the crisis with Iran: Now, 
therefore, be it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S97 
January 8, 2020 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms that efforts to defend United 
States security and interests must take into 
account potential harm to civilians and 
other protected persons and objects in for-
eign countries, consistent with international 
legal principles and our common humanity; 
(2) affirms that the destruction of cultural 
heritage is morally wrong, is a violation of 
international law, and that even threats of 
such destruction undermine years of public 
diplomacy demonstrating that the American 
people do not seek conflict with any cultural 
or religious group; 
(3) affirms that no violation of the law of 
armed conflict or human rights violation by 
Iran or its proxies permits or justifies simi-
lar violations by any other state; 
(4) urges President Donald J. Trump to use 
his bully pulpit to promote de-escalation of 
tensions with Iran rather than to threaten 
acts of war and violations of international 
law; 
(5) strongly condemns the President’s 
threats to destroy sites important to Iranian 
culture and to retaliate against Iran in a dis-
proportionate manner; and 
(6) demands that the President avoid need-
less escalation with Iran and refrain from 
violating the law of armed conflict.

HONORING OFFICER DANIEL 
BALLONI 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Oswego Police Officer, Daniel Balloni, 
for his heroic actions to save a woman from 
the freezing Oswego River. 
On December 29, 2019, at 1:17am, police 
responded to the Oswego River after local 
residents called 911 to report screams coming 
from the river. As officers began investigating 
on the west side of the river, Officer Balloni, 
who was not originally dispatched to the call, 
went to the east side to see if he could help. 
Officer Balloni and his colleagues located a 
young woman in the freezing water struggling 
to stay alive. After several failed attempts by 
the officers to rescue her using a floating ring, 
Officer Balloni removed his gear and jumped 
in the frigid water, grabbing the ring and the 
woman. Aided by his fellow officers, Officer 
Balloni was able to bring the woman to shore. 
Shortly thereafter, paramedics arrived on the 
scene and transported the woman to a local 
hospital where she was treated for hypo-
thermia and is now recovering. 
Officer Balloni risked his own safety and 
suffered from hypothermia during this rescue. 
His actions reaffirm that first responders in our 
community and nationwide put the safety of 
our communities ahead of their own. I am tre-
mendously grateful for the heroic actions of 
Officer Balloni, members of the Oswego Police 
Department, and all of those who work every 
day to keep us safe. 
Madam Speaker, today I am proud to honor 
Officer Daniel Balloni for acting to save the life 
of a young woman. Every day, first responders 
like Officer Balloni put their lives on the line to 
serve and protect our community. I thank him 
as well as the first responders in Central New 
York and across the country for their service.

HONORING RICHARD STEVEN 
GREEN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Richard Steven 
Green. Richard is a very special young man 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active 
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 288, 
and earning the most prestigious award of 
Eagle Scout. 
Richard has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the

scouting, he has not only earned numerous

CELEBRATING THE LEGACY OF 
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, as we 
celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. and reflect on his life and work, we are re-
minded of the challenges that democracy 
poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. 
Dr. King’s life and, unfortunately, his untimely 
death, remind us that we must continually 
work to secure and protect our freedoms. In 
his courage to act, his willingness to meet 
challenges, and his ability to achieve, Dr. King 
embodied all that is good and true in the battle 
for liberty. 
The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens 
of communities throughout our nation. It lives 
on in the people whose actions reflect the 
spirit of resolve and achievement that will help 
move our country into the future. I am honored 
to rise today to recognize several individuals 
from Indiana’s First Congressional District who 
will be recognized during the 41st Annual Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast on 
Saturday, January 18, 2020, at the Genesis 
Convention Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary 
Frontiers Service Club, which was founded in 
1952, sponsors this annual breakfast. 
The Gary Frontiers Service Club will pay 
tribute to local individuals who have for dec-
ades selflessly contributed to improving the 
quality of life for the people of Gary. This year, 
Mark Spencer will be honored with the pres-
tigious Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major 
Award. Additionally, Lieutenant Derrick Can-
non, James Harris, Suzette Raggs, Verlie 
Suggs, and Mildred Guthrie will be recognized 
as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this 
year’s breakfast. 
Though very different in nature, the achieve-
ments of each of these individuals reflect 
many of the same attributes that Dr. King pos-
sessed, as well as the values he advocated. 
Like Dr. King, these individuals saw chal-
lenges and faced them with unwavering 
strength and determination. Each one of the 
honored guests’ greatness has been found in 
their willingness to serve with ‘‘a heart full of 
grace and a soul generated by love.’’ They set 
goals and work selflessly to make them a re-
ality. 
Madam Speaker, I invite you and my other 
distinguished colleagues to join me in com-
mending these honorees, as well as the Gary 
Frontiers Service Club officers, President Oli-
ver Gilliam, who also served as the MLK 
Breakfast Chairman, Vice President Charles 
Jackson, Secretary Linnal Ford, Financial Sec-
retary Valerie Tate, and Treasurer Floyd Don-
aldson, and all members of the service club 
for their initiative, determination, and dedica-
tion to serving the people of Northwest Indi-
ana.

RECOGNIZING GINA LOSS OF 
GREAT FALLS 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Gina Loss, founder of the 
Great Falls Project Linus chapter, for leading 
efforts to provide comfort to Montana’s chil-
dren. 
Project Linus is a national organization with 
chapters throughout the country. Its primary 
mission is to create handmade blankets to 
give to children who face a challenge, crisis, 
or emergency. 
Facing her own challenges, Gina was in-
spired to create a local chapter of Project 
Linus. When faced with personal challenges, 
Gina believes many people often ask, ‘‘Why 
me?’’ When she confronted her own chal-
lenges, she asked herself, ‘‘How do kids get 
through hard times in life?’’ Considering that 
question led her to found the Great Falls 
chapter of Project Linus in March 2006. 
Since its launch, the chapter has given 
more than 15,000 blankets to kids through 
hospitals, dentist offices, and neonatal inten-
sive care units, among others. The entire com-
munity has embraced the effort, and now hun-
dreds of volunteers across Montana offer 
handmade gifts of comfort for thousands of 
kids in need. 
Volunteering her time and resources, Gina 
uses her home as the chapter’s headquarters, 
overseeing everything from storage to quality 
control. Her home is also the distribution cen-
ter where the blankets are sent around the 
state. 
Gina says people don’t realize how much a 
blanket means to a child who is thrust into dif-
ficult, challenging circumstances. She says as 
soon as a kid gets one of their blankets, they 
immediately settle down and never let it go. 
Madam Speaker, for bringing together peo-
ple across the state to provide comfort to chil-
dren when they need it most, I recognize Gina 
Loss and the Great Falls chapter of Project 
Linus for their Spirit of Montana.

IN MEMORY OF AL YOUNG 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the late Mr. Al Young of Lexington, Ken-
tucky. Mr. Young passed away on December 
25, 2019 at the age of 77. Mr. Young was an 
icon in the bourbon business, one of the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky’s signature industries. 
Mr. Young was born in Louisville, Kentucky 
on June 20, 1942. Following his graduation 
from Western Kentucky University and later 
Southern Illinois University, he began his ca-
reer in the distilling industry in 1967. He 
served in a variety of roles and became Dis-
tillery Manager of Four Roses Distillery in 
Lawrenceburg, Kentucky in 1990. He was 
named Brand Ambassador for Four Roses in 
2007, where he served until his passing. Mr. 
Young was a part of the Four Roses family for 
over fifty years. 
Mr. Young was inducted into the Kentucky 
Distillers’ Association Kentucky Bourbon Hall 
of Fame in 2011. He was one of the KDA’s of-
ficial historians due to his extensive knowl-
edge of the industry. He was also inducted 
into the Whisky Magazine Hall of Fame in 
2015. He authored the book Four Roses: The 
Return of a Whiskey Legend. Mr. Young was 
passionate for the industry and was well 
known by bourbon fans around the world. 
Eric Gregory, President of the Kentucky Dis-
tillers’ Association, said ‘‘Al was an ambas-
sador for Kentucky bourbon long before the 
job was even invented. The thing I’ll remem-
ber most is that Al was always smiling. Al-
ways. You just knew he loved his job, his fam-
ily, and his life. We were lucky to share in his 
spirit.’’ 
Mr. Gregory is survived by Gretchen, his 
wife of 52 years, their three children Marc, 
Heather, and Christine, and four grand-
children. 
It is my honor to acknowledge the life of this 
accomplished man, Mr. Al Young, before the 
United States Congress.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL 
OF THE ELAINE RACE MASSACRE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
one-hundred years ago, soldiers, returned 
from the European front in WWI were com-
mitted to benefitting from the opportunity and 
liberty they secured at great risk and sacrifice 
to themselves. Many took that commitment to 
autonomy and freedom home to the small 
towns, communities, and homesteads where 
families and livelihoods remained. One-hun-
dred years ago, few eyes were turned toward 
a small agrarian community in Northeast Ar-
kansas, where black sharecroppers, spurred in 
part by the tales of opportunity and liberty 
spun by these returning patriots, dared to dis-
cuss fair pay for their crops. To this day, the 
accounts of the tragic loss of life that took 
place during the Elaine Massacre, when white 
mobs killed more than 100 African Americans, 
remains widely unknown. 
In September, I had the opportunity to at-
tend the dedication of a memorial to the vic-
tims of the 1919 Elaine Massacre. I also had 
the distinct pleasure of meeting the Honorable 
Brian Miller, U.S. District Judge and nephew 
of Leroy Johnston, WWI veteran, Purple Heart 
recipient, and murder victim during the Elaine 
Massacre. I would like to include in the 
RECORD Judge Miller’s remarks from the cere-
mony. 
THE ELAINE MASSACRE MEMORIAL DEDICATION 
CEREMONY 
Court Square Park, 350 Perry Street, Helena, 
Arkansas, September 29, 2019. 
(By Judge Brian Miller) 
One-hundred years ago, on September the 
30th of 1919, on this block, Phillips County’s 
civic, political, and economic leaders settled 
in for a night at the Helena Opera House, 
which used to stand on this block. 
One-hundred years ago, on the same night, 
three men met at the Phillips County Court-
house and drove down to Hoop Spur Church. 
They went to Hoop Spur Church to check on 
a meeting of black sharecroppers who were 
attempting to unionize. And those people 
were unionizing so that they could be paid 
fairly. The three men left from that court-
house across the street from this block. 
While the black sharecroppers fought for 
fair pay, the black business class in Helena 
built movie theaters and cathedrals. They 
owned rental property. They ran small busi-
nesses. They practiced medicine on Walnut 
Street, which runs on the west side of this 
block. 
While the black business class ran their 
businesses on Walnut Street, the white busi-
ness class owned banks, movie theaters, res-
taurants, and retail stores on Cherry Street, 
which is that street that runs on the east 
side of this block. Two sides of this block. 
And although there was a wide divide be-
tween the black and white business classes, 
there was an even greater divide between the 
black business class and the black share-
croppers meeting at Hoop Spur that night. 
The 30 miles that separated this block and 
Walnut Street from Hoop Spur might as well 
have been a million miles, because there was 
nothing holding together the black business 
class and the sharecroppers meeting at Hoop 
Spur that night, except for shared history 
and black skin. 
But what neither group could have imag-
ined happened 100 years ago. The three men 
who left the courthouse across the street 
from this block fired shots into the Hoop 
Spur Church. And shots were fired out of the 
church, and a white man was killed. 
A posse formed in that courthouse across 
the street from this block, and mob violence 
ensued. When the dust settled, five white 
men were killed, and more than 100 black 
people were killed. Estimates have gone as 
much as 800, but most historians have set-
tled on about 200. And the mob raged on. 
More than 100 black people were arrested 
and brought to the Phillips County Jail 
across the street from this block. Those men 
were brutally beaten and tortured in that 
jail across the street from this block. And 
the mob gathered. 
Right here on this block, right where you 
sit, the mob gathered and chanted and 
screamed for death. And 12 men were given 
sham trials in that courthouse across the 
street from this block and sentenced to die 
across the street from this block. 
But Judge Jacob Trieber stayed those exe-
cutions in the old federal courthouse that 
once stood on that corner across the street 
from this block. 
Now, after 100 years, we return. And where 
do we return? We return to this block. We re-
turn not to relive 1919. We return to this 
block to remember and honor those who 
were killed. We return in hope. We return to 
this block with an earnest yearning for re-
demption. We return to this block with an 
earnest yearning for reconciliation. 
Those of us who failed to take up the cause 
of the sharecroppers seek redemption for 
failing to help those less fortunate than our-
selves. And those of us who joined the mob 
or contributed to the slaughter of the share-
croppers seek redemption for doing the un-
thinkable. 
And all of us, whether we are the descend-
ants of the mob, whether we are the descend-
ants of those who were killed by the mob, or 
whether we are just people of good will, seek 
reconciliation with one another. 
We return to this block on this day and at 
this time to face the reality that we stand on 
the shoulders of our ancestors. We all love 
our ancestors and we all respect them. But 
we also accept the reality that they were not 
perfect. We understand that they were 
human beings. We understand that they were 
susceptible to human frailty. 
Because of this, we return to this block to 
announce that we will be vigilant not to re-
peat their mistakes. We return to this block 
to forgive one another, and to ask for for-
giveness. We return to this block to accept 
that forgiveness and to allow ourselves to be 
redeemed. 
And this, the Elaine Massacre Memorial, 
forever stands as a reminder of why we have 
returned to this block. Every time we feel 
angry, every time we feel embittered, every 
time we feel slighted, every time we feel di-
visive, and every time we feel guilty, we will 
see that monument and we will remember 
the nightmare that all of those emotions will 
bring. 
And we will remember this day and how we 
feel at this moment, and we will recommit 
ourselves to loving and respecting one an-
other, even when we disagree.

HONORING SETH KOHLER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Seth Kohler. 
Seth is a very special young man who has ex-
emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and 
leadership by taking an active part in the Boy 
Scouts of America, Troop 313, and earning 
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Seth has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Seth has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Seth 
has contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. Seth designed and con-
structed a flag pole outside of his church. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Seth Kohler for his accom-
plishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING DAVID CONDON, 
MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SPOKANE 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank 
Mayor David Condon, who will go down as 
Spokane’s most significant mayor since Expo 
’74. Mayor Condon is a friend, my former dis-
trict director and deputy chief of staff, a former 
U.S. Army Captain, and a visionary and com-
passionate leader who during his eight years 
of service to the City of Spokane showed that 
a good government doesn’t have to be an ex-
pensive one. 
When David earned the trust of Spokane’s 
citizens and was elected as mayor, the crime 
in the city was high, development had slowed, 
and the river that runs through the heart of the 
city was becoming more polluted every day. 
David set out with a tremendous vision to re-
verse these trends, and lead a revitalization of 
the city that will continue to be realized and 
appreciated for decades to come. 
During his time as the Mayor of Spokane— 
the largest city in my district—David was 
known for his focus on solutions to help the 
city grow and modernize for the future. He 
was instrumental in championing the revival of 
Spokane’s Riverfront Park, cleaning up our 
river and restoring the lifeblood of Spokane. 
His efforts were recognized nationally, includ-
ing by President Obama. 
During 
his 
thoughtful 
tenure, 
Spokane 
thrived because David always worked to bring 
new and exciting businesses to our area and 
provide even more opportunities for people to 
build a better life. The city’s median household 
income has increased by 37 percent since 
2014, job growth is up 3.9 percent since 2015, 
and the crime rate is down. The future of Spo-
kane’s libraries is secured through David’s 
leadership in passing a bond to remodel four 
existing libraries and build three more. David 
also championed rebuilding the city’s aging in-
frastructure through smart investment and en-
couraging private partnerships. He hired more 
police officers, firefighters, and emergency re-
sponders and improved our emergency serv-
ice response time to better protect and serve 
the city. Spokane, and all of Eastern Wash-
ington, is stronger today because of Mayor 
Condon’s remarkable and visionary leader-
ship. 
He put Spokane on the map. We are no 
longer a medium-sized town in search of our 
identity, we are a national model and a shining 
example for other cities to follow. That is be-
cause of David’s time, talent, sweat, and 
tears. 
I’m proud to call David a friend and col-
league. As he embarks on the next chapter, 
we will miss the leadership that he brought. 
On behalf of Washington’s Fifth Congressional 
District, I thank Mayor Condon for his eight 
years of service and commitment to the City of 
Spokane. He left the city better off than he 
found it and truly made Spokane the ‘‘City of 
Choice.’’

LETTER FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HON. W. GREGORY STEUBE 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, in light of 
how the House concluded 2019 with the pas-
sage of Articles of Impeachment, and the cur-
rent state of the process, the constituents of 
Florida’s 17th Congressional District and all 
Americans must be informed about the truth of 
this process as accurately conveyed in this let-
ter from President Trump to Speaker PELOSI. 
THE WHITE HOUSE, 
Washington, December 17, 2019. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I write to express 
my strongest and most powerful protest 
against the partisan impeachment crusade 
being pursued by the Democrats in the House 
of Representatives. This impeachment rep-
resents an unprecedented and unconstitu-
tional abuse of power by Democrat Law-
makers, unequaled in nearly two and a half 
centuries of American legislative history. 
The Articles of Impeachment introduced 
by the House Judiciary Committee are not 
recognizable under any standard of Constitu-
tional theory, interpretation, or jurispru-
dence. They include no crimes, no mis-
demeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You 
have cheapened the importance of the very 
ugly word, impeachment! 
By proceeding with your invalid impeach-
ment, you are violating your oaths of office, 
you are breaking your allegiance to the Con-
stitution, and you are declaring open war on 
American Democracy. You dare to invoke 
the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this elec-
tion-nullification scheme—yet your spiteful 
actions display unfettered contempt for 
America’s founding and your egregious con-
duct threatens to destroy that which our 
Founders pledged their very lives to build. 
Even worse than offending the Founding Fa-
thers, you are offending Americans of faith 
by continually saying ‘‘I pray for the Presi-
dent,’’ when you know this statement is not 
true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. 
It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you 
will have to live with it, not I! 
Your first claim, ‘‘Abuse of Power,’’ is a 
completely 
disingenuous, 
meritless, 
and 
baseless invention of your imagination. You 
know that I had a totally innocent conversa-
tion with the President of Ukraine. I then 
had a second conversation that has been mis-
quoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently 
misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a 
transcript of the conversation taken, and 
you know from the transcript (which was im-
mediately made available) that the para-
graph in question was perfect. I said to 
President Zelensky: ‘‘I would like you to do 
us a favor, though, because our country has 
been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot 
about it.’’ I said do us a favor, not me, and 
our country, not a campaign. I then men-
tioned the Attorney General of the United 
States. Every time I talk with a foreign lead-
er, I put America’s interests first, just as I 
did with President Zelensky. 
You are turning a policy disagreement be-
tween two branches of government into an 
impeachable offense—it is no more legiti-
mate than the Executive Branch charging 
members of Congress with crimes for the 
lawful exercise of legislative power. 
You know full well that Vice President 
Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of 
U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing 
the prosecutor who was digging into the 
company paying his son millions of dollars. 
You know this because Biden bragged about 
it on video. Biden openly stated: ‘‘I said, ‘I’m 
telling you, you’re not getting the billion 
dollars’ . . . I looked at them and said: ‘I’m 
leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not 
fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, 
son of a bitch. He got fired.’’ Even Joe Biden 
admitted just days ago in an interview with 
NPR that it ‘‘looked bad.’’ Now you are try-
ing to impeach me by falsely accusing me of 
doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actu-
ally did. 
President Zelensky has repeatedly de-
clared that I did nothing wrong, and that 
there was No Pressure. He further empha-
sized that it was a ‘‘good phone call,’’ that ‘‘I 
don’t feel pressure,’’ and explicitly stressed 
that ‘‘nobody pushed me.’’ The Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister stated very Clearly: ‘‘I 
have never seen a direct link between inves-
tigations and security assistance.’’ He also 
said there was ‘‘No Pressure.’’ Senator Ron 
Johnson 
of 
Wisconsin, 
a 
supporter 
of 
Ukraine who met privately with President 
Zelensky, has said: ‘‘At no time during this 
meeting . . . was there any mention by 
Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were 
feeling pressure to do anything in return for 
the military aid.’’ Many meetings have been 
held between representatives of Ukraine and 
our country. Never once did Ukraine com-
plain about pressure being applied—not once! 
Ambassador Sandland testified that I told 
him: ‘‘No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I 
want nothing. I want President Zelensky to 
do the right thing, do what he ran on.’’ 
The second claim, so-called ‘‘Obstruction 
of Congress,’’ is preposterous and dangerous. 
House Democrats are trying to impeach the 
duly elected President of the United States 
for asserting Constitutionally based privi-
leges that have been asserted on a bipartisan 
basis by administrations of both political 
parties throughout our Nation’s history. 
Under that standard, every American presi-
dent would have been impeached many times 
over. As liberal law professor Jonathan 
Turley warned when addressing Congres-
sional Democrats: ‘‘I can’t emphasize this 
enough . . . if you impeach a president, if 
you make a high crime and misdemeanor out 
of going to the courts, it is an abuse of 
power. It’s your abuse of power. You’re doing 
precisely what you’re criticizing the Presi-
dent for doing.’’ 
Everyone, you included, knows what is 
really happening. Your chosen candidate lost 
the election in 2016, in an Electoral College 
landslide (306–227), and you and your party 
have never recovered from this defeat. You 
have developed a full-fledged case of what 
many in the media call Trump Derangement 
Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over 
it! You are unwilling and unable to accept 
the verdict issued at the ballot box during 
the great Election of 2016. So you have spent 
three straight years attempting to overturn 
the will of the American people and nullify 
their votes. You view democracy as your 
enemy! 
Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last 
week at a public forum that your party’s im-
peachment effort has been going on for ‘‘two 
and a half years,’’ long before you ever heard

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E12 
January 8, 2020 
about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen 
minutes after I took the oath of office, the 
Washington Post published a story head-
lined, ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach President 
Trump Has Begun.’’ Less than three months 
after my inauguration, Representative Max-
ine Waters stated, ‘‘I’m going to fight every 
day until he’s impeached.’’ House Democrats 
introduced the first impeachment resolution 
against me within months of my inaugura-
tion, for what will be regarded as one of our 
country’s best decisions, the firing of James 
Cormey (see Inspector General Reports)— 
who the world now knows is one of the dirti-
est cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting 
and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, 
declared just hours after she was sworn into 
office, ‘‘We’re gonna go in there and we’re 
gonna impeach the motherf****r.’’ Rep-
resentative Al Green said in May, ‘‘I’m con-
cerned that if we don’t impeach this presi-
dent, he will get re-elected.’’ Again, you and 
your allies said, and did, all of these things 
long before you ever heard of President 
Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As 
you know very well, this impeachment drive 
has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the to-
tally appropriate conversation I had with its 
new president. It only has to do with your 
attempt to undo the election of 2016 and 
steal the election of 2020! 
Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied 
all the way up to the present day, even going 
so far as to fraudulently make up, out of 
thin air, my conversation with President 
Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy 
language to Congress as though it were said 
by me. His shameless lies and deceptions, 
dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, 
is one of the main reasons we are here today. 
You and your party are desperate to dis-
tract from America’s extraordinary econ-
omy, incredible jobs boom, record stock mar-
ket, soaring confidence, and flourishing citi-
zens. Your party simply cannot compete 
with our record: 7 million new jobs; the low-
est-ever unemployment for African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Ameri-
cans; a rebuilt military; a completely re-
formed VA with Choice and Accountability 
for our great veterans; more than 170 new 
federal judges and two Supreme Court Jus-
tices: historic tax and regulation cuts; the 
elimination of the individual mandate; the 
first decline in prescription drug prices in 
half a century; the first new branch of the 
United States Military since 1947, the Space 
Force; strong protection of the Second 
Amendment; criminal justice reform; a de-
feated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the 
world’s number one terrorist leader, al- 
Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous 
NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful 
USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a break-
through Phase One trade deal with China; 
massive new trade deals with Japan and 
South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible 
Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair 
and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming 
the world’s top energy producer; recognition 
of Israel’s capital, opening the American 
Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing 
Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a 
colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, 
the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the 
building of the Southern Border Wall—and 
that is just the beginning, there is so much 
more. You cannot defend your extreme poli-
cies—open borders, mass migration, high 
crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, 
destruction of American energy, late-term 
taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the 
Second Amendment, radical far-left theories 
of law and justice, and constant partisan ob-
struction of both common sense and common 
good. 
There is nothing I would rather do than 
stop referring to your party as the Do-Noth-
ing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don’t know 
that you will ever give me a chance to do so. 
After three years of unfair and unwar-
ranted investigations, 45 million dollars 
spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the 
entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership 
now proven to be totally incompetent and 
corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few peo-
ple in high position could have endured or 
passed this test. You do not know, nor do 
you care, the great damage and hurt you 
have inflicted upon wonderful and loving 
members of my family. You conducted a fake 
investigation upon the democratically elect-
ed President of the United States, and you 
are doing it yet again. 
There are not many people who could have 
taken the punishment inflicted during this 
period of time, and yet done so much for the 
success of America and its citizens. But in-
stead of putting our country first, you have 
decided to disgrace our country still further. 
You completely failed with the Mueller re-
port because there was nothing to find, so 
you decided to take the next hoax that came 
along, the phone call with Ukraine—even 
though it was a perfect call. And by the way, 
when I speak to foreign countries, there are 
many people, with permission, listening to 
the call on both sides of the conversation. 
You are the ones interfering in America’s 
elections. You are the ones subverting Amer-
ica’s Democracy. You are the ones Obstruct-
ing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain 
and suffering to our Republic for your own 
selfish personal, political, and partisan gain. 
Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the 
Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence, 
and regardless of the truth, you and your 
deputies claimed that my campaign colluded 
with the Russians—a grave, malicious, and 
slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You 
forced our Nation through turmoil and tor-
ment over a wholly fabricated story, ille-
gally purchased from a foreign spy by Hil-
lary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault 
our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie 
was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy 
dissolved into dust, you did not apologize. 
You did not recant. You did not ask to be 
forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capac-
ity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued 
your next libelous and vicious crusade—you 
engineered an attempt to frame and defame 
an innocent person. All of this was moti-
vated by personal political calculation. Your 
Speakership and your party are held hostage 
by your most deranged and radical rep-
resentatives of the far left. Each one of your 
members lives in fear of a socialist primary 
challenger—this is what is driving impeach-
ment. Look at Congressman Nadler’s chal-
lenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not 
take our country down with your party. 
If you truly cared about freedom and lib-
erty for our Nation, then you would be de-
voting your vast investigative resources to 
exposing the full truth concerning the FBI’s 
horrifying abuses of power before, during, 
and after the 2016 election—including the use 
of spies against my campaign, the submis-
sion of false evidence to a FISA court, and 
the concealment of exculpatory evidence in 
order to frame the innocent. The FBI has 
great and honorable people, but the leader-
ship was inept and corrupt. I would think 
that you would personally be appalled by 
these revelations, because in your press con-
ference the day you announced impeach-
ment, you tied the impeachment effort di-
rectly to the completely discredited Russia 
Hoax, declaring twice that ‘‘all roads lead to 
Putin,’’ when you know that is an abject lie. 
I have been far tougher on Russia than Presi-
dent Obama ever even thought to be. 
Any member of Congress who votes in sup-
port of impeachment—against every shred of 
truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle—is 
showing how deeply they revile the voters 
and how truly they detest America’s Con-
stitutional order. Our Founders feared the 
tribalization of partisan politics, and you are 
bringing their worst fears to life. 
Worse still, I have been deprived of basic 
Constitutional Due Process from the begin-
ning of this impeachment scam right up 
until the present. I have been denied the 
most fundamental rights afforded by the 
Constitution, including the right to present 
evidence, to have my own counsel present, to 
confront accusers, and to call and cross-ex-
amine witnesses, like the so-called whistle-
blower who started this entire hoax with a 
false report of the phone call that bears no 
relationship to the actual phone call that 
was made. Once I presented the transcribed 
call, 
which 
surprised 
and 
shocked 
the 
fraudsters (they never thought that such evi-
dence would be presented), the so-called 
whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, 
disappeared because they got caught, their 
report was a fraud, and they were no longer 
going to be made available to us. In other 
words, once the phone call was made public, 
your whole plot blew up, but that didn’t stop 
you from continuing. 
More due process was afforded to those ac-
cused in the Salem Witch Trials. 
You and others on your committees have 
long said impeachment must be bipartisan— 
it is not. You said it was very divisive—it 
certainly is, even far more than you ever 
thought possible-and it will only get worse! 
This is nothing more than an illegal, par-
tisan attempted coup that will, based on re-
cent sentiment, badly fail at the voting 
booth. You are not just after me, as Presi-
dent, you are after the entire Republican 
Party. But because of this colossal injustice, 
our party is more united than it has ever 
been before. History will judge you harshly 
as you proceed with this impeachment cha-
rade. Your legacy will be that of turning the 
House of Representatives from a revered leg-
islative body into a Star Chamber of par-
tisan persecution. 
Perhaps most insulting of all is your false 
display of solemnity. You apparently have so 
little respect for the American People that 
you expect them to believe that you are ap-
proaching this impeachment somberly, re-
servedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent per-
son believes what you are saying. Since the 
moment I won the election, the Democrat 
Party has been possessed by Impeachment 
Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a 
somber affair. You are making a mockery of 
impeachment and you are scarcely con-
cealing your hatred of me, of the Republican 
Party, and tens of millions of patriotic 
Americans. The voters are wise, and they are 
seeing straight through this empty, hollow, 
and dangerous game you are playing. 
I have no doubt the American people will 
hold you and the Democrats fully responsible 
in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not 
soon forgive your perversion of justice and 
abuse of power. 
There is far too much that needs to be 
done to improve the lives of our citizens. It 
is time for you and the highly partisan 
Democrats in Congress to immediately cease 
this impeachment fantasy and get back to 
work for the American People. While I have 
no expectation that you will do so, I write 
this letter to you for the purpose of history 
and to put my thoughts on a permanent and 
indelible record. 
One hundred years from now, when people 
look back at this affair, I want them to un-
derstand it and learn from it. so that it can 
never happen to another President again. 
Sincerely yours, 
DONALD J. TRUMP, 
President of the United States of America.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND 
RE-OPENING OF THE MICHIGAN 
UNION 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the grand re-opening of the 
Michigan Union. 
The Michigan Union is a cornerstone of the 
University of Michigan. Opened in 1919, the 
Michigan Union is one of the oldest college 
unions in the country. For nearly a century, 
the Michigan Union has given students, fac-
ulty, and members of the Ann Arbor commu-
nity a space to gather, study, and socialize. 
Throughout the years, the Michigan Union has 
undergone a great deal of transformation and 
witnessed some of our nation’s greatest histor-
ical moments. On the morning of October 14, 
1960, Democratic presidential nominee John 
F. Kennedy gave an impromptu speech that 
laid the groundwork for the Peace Corps. 
Later, during a visit to the University of Michi-
gan, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. joined students 
in the Michigan Union to discuss his thoughts 
on discrimination and the future of integration 
in America. To carry on this impactful legacy 
and adapt to meet the needs of 21st century 
students, the Michigan Union closed in May 
2018 to undergo an $85.2 million renovation. 
Today, we celebrate the Michigan Union as 
it opens its doors once again. While maintain-
ing the architectural integrity of the 1919 origi-
nal structure, Michigan Union has vastly re-
modeled internal features. Aside from tech-
nology upgrades and infrastructure renewals, 
the Michigan Union now includes expanded 
lounge and study rooms, a revolutionary idea 
hub, an enclosed courtyard, collaborative 
spaces, and a host of different food vendors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the grand re-opening 
of the Michigan Union. Through the historical 
renovation, the Michigan Union will continue to 
be an iconic symbol of the University of Michi-
gan for generations to come.

HONORING JOSEPH MAYNE 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Joseph Mayne. 
Joseph is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 356, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Joseph has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Joseph has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Jo-
seph has contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Joseph lo-
cated, plotted out, and painted mile markers 
for every quarter-mile along a four-mile loop 
around Watkins Mill Lake in Watkins Mill State 
Park, allowing first responders to have some 
means of locating those in need of their help 
when an emergency call is made and for 
hikers to track their progress around the lake. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Joseph Mayne for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND CON-
TRIBUTIONS OF FATHER GEORGE 
CLEMENTS 
HON. WM. LACY CLAY 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, in 1971 the 
Congressional Black Caucus was formed by 
the following Members of Congress: 
Representative Shirley A. Chisholm (D– 
NY.); Representative William L. Clay, Sr. (D– 
MO); Representative George W. Collins (D– 
IL); Representative John Conyers (D–MI); 
Representative Ronald V. Dellums (D–CA); 
Representative Charles C. Diggs, Jr. (D–MI); 
Representative Augustus F. Hawkins (D–CA); 
Representative Ralph H. Metcalfe (D–IL); Rep-
resentative Parren J. Mitchell (D–MD); Rep-
resentative Robert N.C. Nix, Sr. (D–PA); Rep-
resentative Charles B. Rangel (D–NY); Rep-
resentative Louis Stokes (D–OH); and Dele-
gate Walter E. Fauntroy (D–D.C.). 
Congressman William L. Clay, Sr. invited 
Father George Clements, Pastor of Holy An-
gels Catholic Church in Chicago, lllinois, to 
provide the Invocation for the Congressional 
Black Caucus’ inaugural Dinner. He prayed: 
‘‘Lord, make the Congressional Black Cau-
cus instruments of Your peace. Where there 
is hatred, let Augustus Hawkins and Walter 
Fauntroy sow love. Where there Is injury let 
Charles Diggs and Robert Nix bring pardon. 
Where there is doubt let Shirley Chisholm 
restore faith. Where there is despair let Ron-
ald Dellums bring hope. Where there is dark-
ness let Charles Diggs Bring light and where 
there is sadness let William Clay bring joy. 
‘‘O Divine Master grant that John Conyers 
may not so much seek to be consoled as to 
console: That George Collins may not so 
much seek to be understood as to under-
stand; That Louis Stokes may not so much 
seek to be loved as to love. 
‘‘For it is in giving that Parren Mitchell 
receives. It is in dying that the Congres-
sional Black Caucus is born to eternal life.’’ 
While Father Clements was the first to pro-
vide an invocation to the Congressional Black 
Caucus Dinner, he also had many other 
‘‘firsts’’ in his lifetime. 
In 1945, Father Clements was the first Afri-
can American graduate of Archbishop Quigley 
Preparatory Seminary. He was ordained as a 
priest in 1957 and went on to become the first 
African American priest to serve at Holy An-
gels Parish on Chicago’s South side from 
1969 to 1991. He helped create programs like 
the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus to 
support African-Americans within the church. 
Father Clements spearheaded the ‘‘One 
Church-One Child’’ program in 1980, which 
aimed to spur Catholic churches to find adop-
tive parents for orphaned black children. In 
fact, he was the first Catholic priest to adopt 
a child, and later adopted 3 more sons. He 
also started a program for people living with 
drug addiction in 1944, and another for incar-
cerated people and their families in 1999. 
Father Clements also served at other Chi-
cago parishes, including St. Ambrose from 
July 1957 to July 1962, and St. Dorothy from 
July 1962 to June 1969. Outside of Chicago, 
Clements served at the Diocese of Nassau 
(Bahamas) from September 1991 to October 
1993, and the Archdiocese of Washington, 
D.C., from October 1993 to March 2006. 
He was a longtime civil rights advocate from 
Chicago’s Southside. He marched with Rev. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., in Chicago, Alabama 
and Mississippi. Father Clements was one of 
the first voices advocating for civil rights for 
African Americans within the Catholic Church, 
according to Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. 
Sabina Church on Chicago’s South Side. His 
career inspired a made-for-television movie in 
1989, ‘‘The Father Clements Story’’. 
Father Clements was born ‘‘George Harold 
Clements’’ in Chicago in 1932. On Monday, 
November 25, 2019, Father Clements passed 
away at the age of 87. As a devoted priest, 
human and civil rights activist, and trailblazer, 
he will surely be missed by the communities 
he served.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
DENNY CHEN 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Mr. Denny 
Chen, a beloved member of California’s 33rd 
Congressional District, who passed away at 
the age of 81 on November 15, 2019 in Tor-
rance, California. Denny’s dental practice has 
served South Bay residents for more than 30 
years. 
Born on November 24, 1937 in Taiwan’s 
Sanxia 
District, 
Denny 
graduated 
from 
Keelung High School and attended Taiwan’s 
National Defense Medical University. Denny 
then served as a naval officer in the Republic 
of China Navy for 10 years before starting a 
private dental practice in 1969 in Taipei, Tai-
wan. 
Denny moved his family to the United 
States in 1978, where he enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Southern California School of Den-
tistry. He received his degree and opened his 
dental practice in Torrance in 1981, where he 
served the South Bay community for 33 years 
until his retirement in 2014. Denny’s family 
moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 1989. 
Whether playing golf, ballroom dancing, or 
singing, Denny enjoyed the wonderful life he 
led and the people with whom he spent it. 
Denny is survived by his wife, Salina; stepson, 
Ben, and his wife, May; son, Peter, and his 
wife, Cindy; and three grandchildren: Kirk, 
Mark, and Priscilla. May his memory be a 
blessing to all the patients he cared for over 
the years and lives he touched in the commu-
nity.

HONORING THE 97TH BIRTHDAY OF 
JAMES A. ST. JULIEN, SR. 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the 97th Birthday of World War II Vet-
eran, Mr. James A. St. Julien, Sr.—also 
known as ‘‘PawPaw.’’ 
Born on January 9, 1923, Mr. St. Julien is 
a lifelong New Orleanian and was raised in 
the 7th Ward. He is a proud member of the 
Corpus Christi Catholic Church. Prior to her 
transition nearly 10 years ago, he was married 
to his beloved wife Mrs. Selma St. Julien for 
67 years. Additionally, he is the father of 11 
children: 9 girls and 2 boys and has over 35 
grandchildren, 50 great grandchildren, 10 
great great grandchildren, and a host of 
nieces, nephews, and extended family mem-
bers. 
As a World War II Veteran, Mr. St. Julien 
participated in several campaigns and thea-
ters. The American Theater of WWII, the Asi-
atic-Pacific Theater of WWII, and the Battle of 
the Philippines. In the 766 Engineering Com-
pany, Mr. St. Julien cleared the pathway for 
the landings on the island of Leyte. A force of 
700 vessels and 174,000 men accompanied 
these landings. On July 5, 1945, General of 
the Army Douglas MacArthur announced the 
liberation of the Philippines. Shortly after the 
end of WWII, Mr. St. Julien was honorably dis-
charged and separated from the U.S. Army on 
December 18, 1945. 
Mr. St. Julien’s military service to our coun-
try is truly admirable. He is a leader and role 
model in the community. His 97th Birthday de-
serves to be celebrated and I am honored to 
join in its celebration. I thank Mr. St. Julien for 
his service, and I wish him many more birth-
days. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the 97th Birth-
day of a proud World War II Veteran, Mr. 
James A. St. Julien, Sr.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
WALSH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Joe Walsh, who 
passed away on December 28, 2019 after a 
lifetime of service to his country. 
Joe was born on March 18, 1919 in East 
Orange, New Jersey. After enlisting in the Ma-
rines in 1938, Joe served in the Marine Corps’ 
Third Defense Battalion at the Navy Yard in 
Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He was 
attending a morning color guard ceremony 
when the attack began. He helped man three 
anti-aircraft guns to shoot down the invading 
planes. 
Joe believed that ‘‘the guys who were over 
there who didn’t make it back deserved to be 
remembered.’’ Joe was the last surviving 
member and cofounder of the Pearl Harbor 
Survivor Association’s North County Chapter 
31. Since 1986, he organized an annual me-
morial at Oceanside Harbor on the anniver-
sary of the Pearl Harbor bombing. He at-
tended his last memorial service two weeks 
before he passed. 
I was honored to meet Joe and his wife Bea 
to celebrate his 100th birthday. Bea was one 
of 23,000 women who enlisted in the Marines 
during the war. She was a member of the 
Aviation Women’s Reserve Squadron 21 at 
Quantico, Virginia. Joe and Bea were married 
for 73 years and have six children. 
Joe Walsh lived an incredible and full life. 
He could talk to anyone and somehow make 
them laugh. He was a dedicated husband, 
parent, and friend. We are grateful for his 
service to his country and his contributions to 
the Southern California community.

Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority are known for 
their excellent academic prowess, dedicated 
leadership skills, and commitment to advocacy 
and community service. Through its wide 
breadth of programs, Alpha Kappa Alpha So-
rority endeavors to develop innovative pro-
grams to address significant community issues 
regarding education, health, family, the arts, 
technology, and economics.

distinguished Greek-letter organizations today. 
Its nearly 300,000 members are recognized as

CELEBRATING THE BRAVERY OF 
KYSHAUNE LINDSAY 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the bravery and heroism of 
Kyshaune Lindsay, a fifteen-year-old from 
Phoenix who recently saved the life of a man 
in a burning building. 
Kyshaune was playing basketball outside 
when he saw his neighbor fleeing her home. 
His neighbor, Cindy Nunez, told him that her 
house was on fire and that her brother, who 
is paralyzed and bedridden, was trapped in-
side without access to his wheelchair. Upon 
hearing that Cindy could not physically pick up 
her brother to bring him out of the house, 
Kyshaune did not hesitate to make his way in-
side and help the man, lifting him into his chair 
to get him to safety. 
Marcos Marquez, the man that Kyshaune 
rescued, described him as a ‘‘true hero.’’ His 
selflessness and courage in the face of real 
danger are remarkable, as is his humility in 
the aftermath of the event.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
A 
BILL 
TO 
CLARIFY CERTAIN DUE PROCESS 
RIGHTS OF FEDERAL EMPLOY-
EES SERVING IN SENSITIVE PO-
SITIONS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, as 
hundreds of thousands of our federal workers 
face uncertainty in wages and work, I intro-
duce a bill to clarify certain due process rights 
of federal employees serving in sensitive posi-
tions. This bill would overturn an unprece-
dented federal court decision, Kaplan v. Con-
yers and MSPB, which stripped many federal 
employees of the right to independent review 
of an agency decision removing them from 
jobs on grounds of ineligibility. The case was 
brought by two Department of Defense (DOD) 
employees, Rhonda Conyers, an accounting 
technician, and Devon Northover, a com-
missary management specialist, who were 
permanently demoted and suspended from 
their jobs after they were found to be no 
longer eligible to serve in noncritical sensitive 
positions. In 2014, the Supreme Court de-
clined to hear the case, which allowed the de-
cision to stand. This bill is cosponsored by 
Representative ANDRE CARSON. 
Specifically, the decision prevents federal 
workers who are designated as ‘‘noncritical 
sensitive’’ from appealing to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board (MSPB) if they are removed 
from their jobs. Noncritical sensitive jobs in-
clude those that do not have access to classi-
fied information. The decision would affect at 
least 200,000 DOD employees who are des-
ignated as noncritical sensitive. Even more se-
riously, most federal employees could poten-
tially lose the same right to an independent re-
view of an agency’s decision because of a 
rule by the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) and the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence (ODNI), which went into ef-
fect in July 2015, that permits agency heads 
to designate most jobs in the federal govern-
ment as noncritical sensitive. 
The Kaplan decision undercuts Title 5, sec-
tion 7701 of the Civil Service Act, which en-
sures due process rights for federal workers 
required by the U.S. Constitution. Stripping 
employees whose work does not involve clas-
sified matters of the right of review of an 
agency decision that removes them from their 
jobs 
opens 
entirely 
new 
avenues 
for 
unreviewable, arbitrary action or retaliation by 
an agency head and, in addition, makes a 
mockery of whistleblower protections enacted 
in the 112th Congress. Our bill would stop the 
use of ‘‘national security’’ to repeal a vital 
component of civil service protection and of 
due process. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING ALAN TANDY ON HIS 
RETIREMENT AS CITY MANAGER 
OF BAKERSFIELD 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Alan Tandy, a constituent and 
the long-time City Manager of the City of Ba-
kersfield, California, which I represent. Alan is 
retiring from his current position after 27 years 
of dedicated service to our community. 
Alan earned his Bachelor of Arts in Political 
Science from the University of Oregon and re-
ceived a Master of Arts in Municipal Adminis-
tration from the University of Iowa. Before 
starting his tenure at the City of Bakersfield, 
Alan balanced budgets and learned best gov-
ernment practices in Montana, Wyoming, and 
Ohio. Alan is Bakersfield’s longest-serving city 
manager and has been an integral part of nu-
merous city projects. 
Some notable projects during Alan’s tenure 
include construction of the Rabobank Arena 
and Convention Center and the adjoining Mar-
riott Hotel, the McMurtrey Aquatic Center, and 
the Park at River Walk. Alan was always en-
thusiastic about his work and did what was in 
the best interest for the people of Bakersfield. 
His love for our city remains apparent; in the 
wake of his retirement, he ensured the 
projects he had helped plan were completed 
before stepping down. The Thomas Roads Im-
provement Program, a $1.4 billion collabo-
rative 
project 
to 
improve 
transportation 
throughout Bakersfield will streamline trans-
portation with new highways and bridges. 
During his tenure, Bakersfield transformed 
into one of the fastest growing cities in Cali-
fornia and Alan’s legacy of improving infra-
structure and quality of life is visible in every 
part of Bakersfield. Alan’s work as City Man-
ager has earned him impressive awards and 
accolades, including the Distinguished Budget 
Presentation Award from the Government Fi-
nance Officers Association for 19 years. 
After years of service to our community, 
Alan’s retirement is well-deserved and I know 
he is looking forward to spending more time 
with his wife, Kathleen, their children, Sarah, 
Jared, and Krista, as he begins this new chap-
ter in his life. However, if I know Alan, I know 
that he will remain an active member of the 
Bakersfield community. On behalf of the 23rd 
Congressional District of California, I want to 
thank Alan for all his hard work and dedication 
over the past 27 years to helping make Ba-
kersfield the city it is today.

HONORING NICHOLAS JAMES 
STEINKAMP 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Nicholas James 
Steinkamp. Nicholas is a very special young 
man who has exemplified the finest qualities 
of citizenship and leadership by taking an ac-
tive part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 
288, and earning the most prestigious award 
of Eagle Scout. 
Nicholas has been very active with his 
troop, participating in many scout activities. 
Over the many years Nicholas has been in-
volved with scouting, he has not only earned 
numerous merit badges, but also the respect 
of his family, peers, and community. Most no-
tably, Nicholas has contributed to his commu-
nity through his Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me 
in 
commending 
Nicholas 
James 
Steinkamp for his accomplishments with the 
Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put 
forth in achieving the highest distinction of 
Eagle Scout.

HONORING MS. ANITA BOURN FOR 
30 YEARS AS A CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFFER 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 8, 2020 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize one of my very own, Ms. Anita 
Faye Bourn, for thirty years of dedicated serv-
ice as a congressional staffer. Anita’s career 
with the U.S. House of Representatives began 
in 1989 when my predecessor, Gene Taylor, 
won the special election. Anita was hired on 
as a secretary, but quickly found her niche 
through constituent services. When I first took 
office in 2010, I had the opportunity to carry

over staff from the previous administration. 
Anita was an obvious choice and to this day, 
has proven to be one of my most trusted staff-
ers. 
Anita was born and raised in Hattiesburg, 
Mississippi, with family, faith, and music at her 
epicenter. She would say her mother, Chris-
tine Bourn, is the heart and soul of the family. 
She has two sons, and a niece, to whom she 
is known as ‘‘Tee-Tee’’. Anita also claims a 
host of brothers and sisters in Christ through 
her church family at Shady Grove Baptist 
Church. Anita is a longtime member of the 
church music ministry and is deservedly con-
sidered the resident ‘‘rock star’’. I can attest to 
this as I have had the privilege of hearing her 
beautiful rendition of ‘‘God Bless America’’. 
Anita’s musical career officially began at the 
age of 12, when she started playing piano dur-
ing church services. Since then, Anita has 
served as Director of the inspirational choir, 
the senior adult choir, and the men’s chorus, 
while also directing the annual Easter and 
Christmas programs. Recently, Anita was 
nominated as the Choir Director of the Year at 
the Gulf Coast Gospel Music Awards. Whether 
she is serving my constituents, or ministering 
to her community, Anita pours her heart into 
each of her endeavors. 
In a few words, Anita is faith-filled, compas-
sionate, vibrant, and a true expert in her field. 
I could not ask for a better representative 
among my staff. To close, I would like to 
share one of Anita’s favorite bible verses, Ro-
mans 8:28: ‘‘And we know that all things work 
together for good to those who love God, to 
those who are called according to his pur-
pose’’. Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity 
to express my gratitude to Ms. Anita Bourn for 
thirty exceptional years.
