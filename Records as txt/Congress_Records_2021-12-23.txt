PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, from the beginning of time 
You have loved us. When, at creation, 
You set before us Your marvelous 
handiwork and called it good, You gave 
us the privilege to enjoy all Your grace 
gifts. 
In this season of enjoyment and gift- 
giving, may we see You, the giver of all 
things, in the love wrapped in each 
present. 
In this season of lights, may we see 
that time and again You interrupt the 
darkness that surrounds us with the 
warmth and welcome of Your own bril-
liant light. 
In this season when we pray for peace 
and good will, may we call to mind the 
peace You intended for us at creation, 
the world You desire for us where 
‘‘The wolf shall live with the lamb, 
the leopard shall lie down with the 
kid, 
the calf and the lion and the fatling 
together.’’ 
Reveal the hope that is ours in the 
shoot that grows even from the driest 
stump, the child who loves with the 
most perfect love. 
In the spirit and wisdom that comes 
from the fear of You, O Lord, fill the 
Earth with the knowledge of Your eter-
nal love. 
In Your holy name we pray. 
Amen.

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK HEALY 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Patrick Healy as he prepares 
to conclude his long and storied career as one 
of Los Angeles’ preeminent television report-
ers. For nearly four decades, Patrick has been 
on the front lines for just about every story 
that has shaped and defined the place we call 
home—all with unmatched integrity and dedi-
cation to public service. 
Before he was an award-winning broad-
caster, Patrick was an engineering student at 
UCLA—taking up the family’s journalism tradi-
tion as a reporter for the Daily Bruin. Guided 
by L.A. newsroom giants like Jere Witter and 
Pete Noyes, he got his start writing and pro-
ducing for local outlets across the Southland 
before landing his big break at NBC–4—a sta-
tion which he would call home for the next 37 
years. 
Patrick has since become a fixture in 
Angelenos’ living rooms, with his in-depth cov-
erage of the most famous sagas of our gen-
eration: from Richard Ramirez and Rodney 
King to O.J. Simpson and Dr. Conrad Murray. 
Through them all, he always managed to bring 
us more than just the stories themselves—he 
also reveals the truths they tell about our com-
munities, our people, and our country. 
When he wasn’t rushing to the scene of 
breaking news, Patrick has extensively cov-
ered environmental issues affecting California, 
including how drought and extreme weather 
caused by climate change are impacting the 
people and places we love. It is these stories 
that perhaps best unveil the noble motivation 
behind his work: to investigate and call atten-
tion to our challenges so we can ensure the 
Golden State remains a wonderful place for 
future generations to enjoy. 
Patrick’s love for his home state and home-
town is undoubtedly what makes so many 
Angelenos connect instinctively with his report-
ing. And it is why, like his mentors before him, 
he will go down as one of the great L.A. 
broadcast journalists of our time. As Patrick 
likes to quote, ‘‘News is the first draft of his-
tory’’—if that is so, he has left an indelible 
mark. And we thank him for it. 
I ask all Members to join me in thanking 
Patrick Healy for his service to Los Angeles, 
to California, and to the nation, and in wishing 
him good health and great adventure in retire-
ment.

HONORING WILLIAM THOMAS, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of William Franklin Thomas, Jr. of Pu-
laski, Virginia, who died on November 29, 
2021 at the age of 87. Judge Thomas was a 
distinguished jurist who served for over two 
decades as a juvenile and domestic court 
judge. 
Judge Thomas was born on January 2, 
1934. He grew up in Pulaski and made it his 
lifelong home. After graduating from Pulaski 
High School in 1950, he attended Emory & 
Henry College and graduated from the Univer-
sity of Richmond. After earning a law degree 
from the University of Virginia, he began his 
legal career at the firm known at the time as 
Gilmer, Sadler, Harman & Thomas, mainly 
practicing real estate law. 
In 1973, the Virginia General Assembly 
named him a Juvenile and Domestic Court 
Judge for the 27th Judicial Circuit. He sat on 
the bench until retirement on December 31, 
1995, and served the Counties of Pulaski, 
Wythe, Carroll, Grayson, and Bland and the 
City of Galax. During his judicial career, Judge 
Thomas was widely respected for his commit-
ment to the work and care for the children that 
came before him in court. As a symbol of the 
esteem in which Judge Thomas was held, the 
Pulaski County Bar Association commissioned 
a portrait of him, which now hangs in the 
county courthouse. 
Beyond the bench, Judge Thomas found 
ways to serve his beloved Pulaski. He be-
longed to the Pulaski Jaycees, the Elks, and 
the Masons, and as a devout member of First 
United Methodist Church served on the 
Church Council. A keen interest in politics 
drove him to the 1960 Democratic National 
Convention as a delegate and to run in 2007 
for the Virginia House of Delegates in the 
Sixth District. 
Judge Thomas was preceded in death by 
his wife, Gertrude Davis Thomas; his parents, 
William Franklin Thomas Sr. and Virginia 
Saunders Thomas; and his sister, Elizabeth 
‘‘Betty’’ Thomas Hicks. He is survived by a 
son, Lee Mason Thomas, and four nieces and 
nephews. I would like to offer my condolences 
on the loss of this good man and dedicated ju-
rist.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF TOM 
LEATHERMAN 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the contributions of Tom 
Leatherman to the nation and to the Bay Area. 
Tom started his career with the National 
Park Service (NPS) in 1989 as an intern. Dur-
ing his time with NPS, Tom developed a 
strong working relationship with the Japanese 
American community. Starting in 2005, he 
served as a superintendent at Manzanar His-
toric Site. Additionally, Tom served as the re-
gional representative for NPS’s Japanese 
American Confinement Sites grant program. 
Most recently, Tom worked as a super-
intendent of the four NPS sites in the Con-
gressional District I represent, including Eu-
gene O’Neil National Historic Site, John Muir 
National Historic Site, Port Chicago Naval 
Magazine National Memorial, and Rosie the 
Riveter/World War II Home Front National His-
torical Park. The parks, through Tom’s work, 
help provide visitors with the important history 
of the area. 
In addition to the sites in the Eleventh Dis-
trict, Tom has served at a variety of NPS sites 
throughout his career including Joshua Tree 
National Park, Santa Monica Mountains Na-
tional Recreation Area, Golden Gate National 
Recreation Area, and more. Tom has held a 
number of positions throughout his career in-
cluding superintendent, acting deputy regional 
director, and team lead for the Serious Acci-
dent Investigation Team. 
Tom’s experience and dedication make him 
the perfect fit to serve as superintendent of 
Pearl Harbor National Memorial. I thank Tom 
for his diligence and passion for preserving 
our nation’s natural wonders and history and 
congratulate him on his new role. Please join 
me in honoring Tom for his more than thirty 
years of service to our nation’s park system.

HONORING 
JOHNSTOWN 
MAYOR 
VERN JACKSON FOR OVER FIFTY 
YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE TO 
THE NORTH COUNTRY AND THE 
UNITED STATES 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Johnstown Mayor Vern Jack-
son who has valiantly served the North Coun-
try and the United States for over fifty years. 
I would also like to congratulate Mr. Jackson 
on his retirement after five great years as 
mayor of Johnstown. 
Mayor Jackson has been dedicated to serv-
ing his community in many capacities through-
out his storied career. Prior to entering politics, 
Mr. Jackson served in the United States Navy 
for twenty-five years and then worked for the 
Social Security Administration in Utica and 
Gloversville. After nearly thirty years at the 
Gloversville Social Security Office, Mr. Jack-
son retired and served as the chairman for the 
Johnstown Charter Review Commission. Sub-
sequently, Mr. Jackson became the 4th Ward 
councilman and in 2017 was sworn in as the 
mayor of Johnstown. He was elected to com-
plete the last year of the four-year term of his 
friend, the late Mayor Michael Julius. 
Throughout the last five years, Mayor Jack-
son has worked hard to better the lives of the 
people of Johnstown. He prioritized coopera-
tion with the city of Gloversville and Fulton 
County on issues that impacted their commu-
nities. Mayor Jackson understood the impor-
tance of a city’s first impression after traveling

to many areas while working for the Social Se-
curity Administration. As mayor, he worked to 
stimulate business and motivate business 
owners to enhance the downtown high traffic 
areas and preserve historical Johnstown, pro-
viding the town with a better first impression. 
Mayor Jackson always had an open-door 
policy for any constituent who wished to meet 
with him. His accomplished record and willing-
ness to serve are evident in his over fifty 
years of public service. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st Congressional District, I am hon-
ored to recognize his exceptional leadership 
and his example as a true public servant and 
wish him the best of luck in his next chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF EDITH PRAGUE 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of an eastern Con-
necticut legend, and my friend, Edith Prague. 
Edith’s life was marked by service to others, 
as teacher, a social worker, a state legislator, 
a state commissioner. I met Edith in our days 
working together in the Connecticut General 
Assembly, where she served first a State Rep-
resentative from 1982 to 1990 and then a 
State Senator from 1995 to 2013, and her ex-
ample and guidance on how to conduct your-
self as a public official influenced so many 
new legislators, myself included. She was a 
fierce and tenacious legislator—never one to 
back down from a tough debate or miss a 
chance to advocate for those she served. 
Edith was especially passionate about her 
work for seniors—from lowering drug costs, to 
expanding access to long-term care and 
home-based care. In 1987 the State of Con-
necticut 
permanently 
established 
the 
‘‘CONNPACE’’ program which was one of the 
few public programs that provided direct help 
to seniors for prescription drugs. That program 
was a protype for the federal Medicare Part D 
prescription drug program enacted by Con-
gress two decades later. I remember well as 
a new state representative from Vernon, Con-
necticut watching Edith’s inspirational pas-
sionate speeches on the floor of the general 
assembly the day CONNPACE was enacted. 
That passion led to her confirmation to serve 
as the first ever head of the CT Department of 
Aging, another Prague initiative, which gave 
her an even bigger platform to advocate for 
the needs and priorities of those in need in the 
later stages of life. 
That was always a hallmark of Edith’s serv-
ice—looking out for others and fighting on be-
half of those who needed a champion. Edith 
called herself ‘‘a social worker with power,’’ 
and she worked every day to use her platform 
to make a difference in the lives of those she 
served and crossed paths with over her life-
time. The proof of that is in the countless peo-
ple across eastern Connecticut who can say 
that Edith helped them in ways big and small. 
Above all, though, family was the most im-
portant part of Edith’s life. Being a mother and 
grandmother was always top priority for Edith, 
and I know daughters Shelley, Benay and Jo-
anne and grandchildren Nathan, Matthew, 
Sam, Josh, Chris, Brian, Katie, Tim and Mi-
chael, will remember her love and passion for 
her and for others in need. 
I will always be grateful to call Edith my col-
league and my friend. She was truly one of a 
kind, a wonderful person we just won’t see 
replicated. Our region, our state and our coun-
try are better for her lifetime of service and 
dedication to others. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Edith’s life and legacy as eastern Connecticut 
mourns her passing.

BRINGING JUSTICE TO SOLDIERS 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, passage 
of this year’s National Defense Authorization 
Act (NDAA) serves as an act of reprieve—and 
justice—for every sexual assault survivor who 
has put their life on the line in the name of 
service for this country and has been left be-
hind in the wake of injustice. 
The NDAA contains the revised I am 
Vanessa Guillen Act. For the first time, the 
NDAA establishes the Office of the Special 
Trial Counsel which empowers and requires 
independent investigators to investigate alle-
gations. That means for the first time, the 
NDAA takes the authority to prosecute sexual 
assault and harassment away from the military 
and gives it to independent military prosecu-
tors. 
The military justice reforms included in this 
annual defense policy bill are historic and the 
most transformative in our nation’s history. It is 
the culmination of years of advocacy from mili-
tary sexual assault survivors, their families, 
and supporters. 
But let me be clear: my position on our na-
tion’s bloated defense budget remains un-
changed. 
I remain committed to working with my col-
leagues to address climate change, racial in-
justice, and guaranteeing that families across 
the nation receive the relief they need as we 
work to build back better from a global pan-
demic. These are all problems that no amount 
of military spending can remedy, and we must 
redirect federal resources to the people, to our 
future generations, and to our working-class 
Americans. 
While I have historically voted ‘‘no’’ and plan 
to continue to do so—this was once-in-a-life-
time opportunity to finally right generations of 
injustice against our nation’s servicemembers 
in uniform, to finally bring some sense of jus-
tice to the family of Vanessa Guillen and 
countless other soldiers who are victims of as-
sault. I refused to leave them behind once 
more. 
With the passage of this year’s NDAA, sur-
vivors of sexual assault will finally be guaran-
teed an independent military attorney to de-
cide whether to prosecute and make other 
key, binding decisions in these cases—also 
ensuring that domestic violence, stalking, mur-
der, manslaughter, kidnapping, and other spe-
cial victim offenses are taken out of the chain 
of command. We are one step closer to justice 
and protection for our soldiers. 
My constituents can rest assured that I will 
continue my work to rein in defense spending 
and to invest resources in programs that pro-
mote peace, protect our planet, and provide 
the American people opportunities here at 
home.

RECOGNIZING MR. DAVID 
BALLENGER 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate a dedicated pro-
fessional with the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs on the occasion of his retirement. Mr. 
David Ballenger is an exemplary public serv-
ant who has demonstrated the highest stand-
ards of professionalism serving our nation’s 
veterans. He has served with the Office of 
Congressional and Legislative Affairs at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs for more than 
17 years. His career in public service is a tes-
tament to the importance of selfless service. 
For the last 10 years, Mr. Ballenger served 
as the Director of the Legislative Team in the 
Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs 
at VA. He has been involved in a remarkable 
breadth of important matters spanning VA’s 
health benefits, memorial functions, human re-
sources, information technology, and real 
property. In this capacity, he has been the 
conduit between Congress and VA, providing 
technical assistance on multiple pieces of 
landmark legislation including the VA MIS-
SION Act, the Forever GI Bill, the VA Dis-
ability Appeals Modernization Act, the Blue 
Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, the Vet-
erans’ COMPACT Act, and the Deborah 
Sampson Act. He also spearheaded the De-
partment’s legislative proposal submissions. 
As Mr. Ballenger embarks on a new chapter 
in life, it is my hope that he will recall, with a 
deep sense of pride and accomplishment, the 
outstanding contributions he has made to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Congress, 
and veterans of the United States. May his life 
be filled with health and happiness.

CELEBRATING THE GENEROSITY 
OF MR. RALPH ROTELLA 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the generosity of Ralph Rotella, owner 
of Discount Shoe Repair in Syracuse and driv-
ing force behind Ralphy’s Rescue Mission 
Shoe Drive. 
In 2010, Ralph Rotella was inspired to start 
Ralphy’s Rescue Mission Shoe Drive after 
seeing a homeless person outside of his shop, 
walking in the cold with their toe sticking out. 
He made the decision to provide that person 
with a pair of usable shoes. From that day, 
Ralph began annually collecting, repairing, 
and donating shoes to the Syracuse Rescue 
Mission to help more people in-need. 
In Ralph’s first year of operating the Shoe 
Drive, he donated less than 100 pairs of 
shoes. Each year since then, he has steadily 
expanded his operation, and in 2020, donated 
23,187 pairs of shoes—one of the largest do-
nations the Rescue Mission has ever received.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANSELMO 
F. ARELLANO 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Anselmo 
‘‘Chemo’’ F. Arellano. As a historian, educator, 
author, and activist, Anselmo used his talents 
to preserve New Mexico’s rich culture and his-
tory. In Northern New Mexico, he was what 
we call a seeker of el oro del barrio—the 
knowledge which is the gold of our commu-
nity. 
Anselmo was born on April 27, 1944, in 
Springer, New Mexico. His family instilled in 
him a love for his heritage and culture which 
remained 
with 
him 
throughout 
his 
life. 
Anselmo spent many years as a postsec-
ondary educator in New Mexico. His passion 
for learning and sharing his knowledge was 
apparent to those who had the opportunity to 
meet and learn from him. 
Anselmo’s career in education began at 
Fresno State University at the age of 25, 
where he taught courses in ethnic studies and 
directed a program for first-generation minority 
college students. While working at Fresno 
State, he also volunteered for the United 
Farmworkers Organizing Committee. 
As a distinguished Ford Foundation Fellow, 
Anselmo received his Ph.D. in American Stud-
ies from the University of New Mexico in 1990. 
He used his education to preserve the history, 
culture, and traditions of Northern New Mexico 
and taught others to do the same. Anselmo 
was nationally recognized for his work and 
was selected as a featured historian by the 
Smithsonian Institute for its New Mexico ex-
hibit. 
Like many Nuevo Mexicanos, Anselmo 
knew the power of community and that 
acequia es comunidad. That’s why he worked 
to secure land and water rights for New Mexi-
cans across the state. Understanding the 
hardships that his community faced, Anselmo 
also worked to improve access to education, 
housing, and health care. He served on 
boards for numerous community organizations 
and institutions including the National Hispanic 
Cultural Center. 
On behalf of Nuevo Mexico’s, Third District, 
I am honored to recognize the extraordinary 
life of Anselmo ‘‘Chemo’’ F. Arellano—a hum-
ble and loving husband, father, grandfather, 
and friend. I hope that his legacy will be car-
ried on by everyone he shared his knowledge 
with and by those who knew and loved him.

RECOGNIZING COMMANDER 
REBECCA E. WOLF 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition and appreciation of Com-
mander Rebecca E. Wolf, U.S. Navy, upon 
her completion of the Department of Defense 
Legislative Fellowship program. Assigned to 
my office for the 2021 calendar year, Com-
mander Wolf quickly became an integral part 
of my legislative staff. 
Her expertise as a U.S. Navy Surface War-
fare Officer informed my work as Chairman of 
the House Armed Services Subcommittee on 
Readiness. Over this past year, Commander 
Wolf worked closely with both my personal of-
fice and Readiness Subcommittee staffs on 
the military’s most pressing readiness chal-
lenges. In particular, she helped to secure 
passage of my ‘‘Support Our Military Working 
Dogs Act’’ in section 373 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
She also helped to develop several legisla-
tive priorities that I will be pursuing in the 
forthcoming Coast Guard Authorization Act for 
fiscal years 2022 and 2023. As chair of the 
State Lands Commission while serving as 
California’s lieutenant governor, I am grateful 
for the compromise she negotiated between 
the U.S. Coast Guard and our state regulator 
on the public availability of information regard-
ing the performance of ballast water manage-
ment systems. She will be deeply missed after 
an exceptional year of service, where she 
made a lasting impact. 
Commander 
Wolf 
was 
commissioned 
through the U.S. Naval Academy, where she 
graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 
oceanography. She went on to earn a Master 
of Science in physical oceanography from the 
Naval 
Postgraduate 
School. 
Commander 
Wolf’s operational assignments include service 
aboard the USS WASP (LHD 1), USS FOR-
REST SHERMAN (DDG 98), and USS 
PINCKNEY (DDG 91). She was also the exec-
utive officer and then commanding officer of 
USS GLADIATOR (MCM 11). Her shore and 
staff assignments include tours in Afghanistan, 
at the Surface Warfare Officer School, and at 
COMDESRON 23. 
Her extensive naval background, work ethic, 
and problem-solving skills were critical to my 
work toward recapitalizing our military’s or-
ganic industrial base and ensuring that our 
military is ready when needed. While Com-
mander Wolf will be missed by Team 
Garamendi, the U.S. Navy is lucky to have her 
back in the ranks leading sailors. We wish her 
fair winds and following seas as the executive 
officer of the USS MOMSEN (DDG 92) and 
are excited for all her future successes. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
California’s Third Congressional district and a 
grateful nation, I extend our deepest apprecia-
tion to Commander Rebecca E. Wolf for her 
dedicated service.

CONGRATULATING RAY DUNAWAY 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, Ray Dunaway has been the voice of 
Connecticut for nearly three decades. Ray 
was hired by WTIC–AM to replace another 
Connecticut legend, Bob Steele in 1992. Since 
then, he’s been the voice of talk radio in Con-
necticut each and every morning. Over his 
tenure, he’s helped raise millions of dollars for 
the Greater Hartford Salvation Army through 
his annual holiday store. I have had the pleas-
ure of joining Ray over the years and I’m hon-
ored to call him a friend. Both the following ar-
ticles from the Hartford Courant and the Jour-
nal Inquirer capture what Ray has meant to 
the citizens of the state of Connecticut. I look 
forward to tuning in to his last show tomorrow 
morning on Christmas Eve. We wish him well 
in retirement and know his voice will always 
be missed. 
[From the Hartford Courant, Nov. 19, 2021] 
‘‘VETERAN RADIO VOICE DUNAWAY TO SIGN 
OFF’’ 
(By Kenneth R. Gosselin) 
Ray Dunaway, the morning radio person-
ality who followed the legendary Bob Steele 
on WTIC–AM and won over listeners with a 
relaxed but informed conversational style, 
will retire from the radio station next month 
after 29 years. 
‘‘You just get tired of waking up,’’ 
Dunaway said. ‘‘You just do. I love the morn-
ing. I do. I wouldn’t do any other shift, but 
the thing is, after a period of time, it’s kind 
of like you’ve been there, done that. And I 
think it’s time for somebody fresh to take a 
look at it.’’ 
Dunaway, 72, said the decision to retire 
from the morning show, which airs weekdays 
from 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m., was entirely his 
own. His last show will be on Dec. 24. 
His co-host, Brian Shactman, will continue 
to host the morning show, the station’s par-
ent company, Audacy, said. 
Dunaway was hired to replace Steele in 
1992, bringing with him more than two dec-
ades of radio experience elsewhere in the 
country. Steele had a storied local broad-
casting career spanning more than five dec-
ades, and Dunaway would be Steele’s second 
replacement. Steele’s immediate successor 
lasted just a year. 
‘‘The fact of the matter is, it was nerve- 
wracking because I had gone to Trinity [Col-
lege] and my roommate used to listen to Bob 
religiously,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘He was really 
good. It was a great responsibility taking 
over that job.’’ 
Quick acceptance wasn’t a sure thing for 
Dunaway with the memory of Steele still 
fresh and dissatisfaction among some view-
ers about a move by WTIC to talk radio. 
‘‘Connecticut-ites 
weren’t 
necessarily 
going to make that easy,’’ recalled Gary 
Zenobi, then general manager of WTIC, who 
hired Dunaway. ‘‘But he filled Bob Steele’s 
shoes in a different way. Formats were 
changing. Ray was just perfect for that be-
cause he could hold a conversation not just 
about anything but with anyone.’’ 
Dunaway’s arrival also coincided with 
rapid changes in AM radio. WTIC’s daytime 
music listeners were moving to FM radio, 
leaving AM stations like WTIC to carve out 
a different niche, which turned out to be talk 
radio. 
Dunaway’s popularity with listeners sur-
vived four ownership changes at WTIC and a 
relocation from One Financial Plaza, the 
‘‘Gold Building’’ in downtown Hartford, to 
Farmington in the early 2000s. The tone of 
talk radio has turned more contentious and 
far less civil since Dunaway joined WTIC. 
‘‘It is polarizing, no doubt, but the good 
ones try to make it as fair as they possibly 
can,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘You can have your 
point of view. There’s nothing wrong with 
that, and you are able to share it.’’ Dunaway 
said he worked earlier in his career with con-
servative commentator Rush Limbaugh, who 
died in February. Dunaway said he consid-
ered Limbaugh someone who thought things 
through 
before 
expressing 
his 
opinions.

Limbaugh would also become part of the 
weekday lineup on WTIC. 
Dunaway said there now is pressure to mix 
it up whether it be on radio or television. 
‘‘The whole thing is fight-sell,’’ Dunaway 
said. ‘‘People like fights. It doesn’t help any-
thing. [Conservative intellectual] William F. 
Buckley wouldn’t have survived today.’’ 
Dunaway said he has strived to keep the 
morning show on the lighter side. 
One of this favorite interviews came in 1994 
when then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton came on the air to push her husband’s 
plan for health care reform. 
Clinton jolted local listeners with the 
frank assessment that the plan might cost 
some jobs—paper-pushing jobs, as she called 
them—in Hartford. Some of those jobs, 
Dunaway said, were in buildings he could see 
from his studio on the 19th floor of the Gold 
Building. 
Dunaway, according to a report in The 
Courant, observed the government didn’t 
have a great track record of containing 
costs, asking, ‘‘How can we trust you this 
time?’’ 
Return to Hartford 
When Dunaway arrived in downtown Hart-
ford in 1992, he found a city changed vastly 
in appearance from when he attended Trinity 
two decades earlier. The 1980s building boom 
had given rise to skyscrapers like CityPlace 
and Goodwin Square. 
But the early 1990s also was marked by 
economic recession and a bad after-taste 
from the Colonial Realty Co. collapse that 
cost ‘‘Mom & Pop’’ investors their life sav-
ings in a bigger-than-life fraud scheme. 
Dunaway said the election of Hartford 
Mayor Michael P. Peters, the wisecracking 
firefighter, in 1993, started to tum things 
around. The two quickly became good friends 
and often ran into each other at the old 
Chuck’s steakhouse in downtown Hartford. 
Peters, who died in 2009, was a frequent guest 
on Dunaway’s show. 
‘‘Mike Peters got things done . . . . He had 
no real political power, but through the force 
of his personality managed to get things 
done,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘He changed the atti-
tude, let’s put it that way.’’ That set the 
stage for big-ticket Hartford investments 
like the Connecticut Convention Center, 
Front Street—and more recently, the addi-
tion of thousands of apartments downtown, 
Dunaway said. 
Dunaway started in radio at age 17 on a 
Topeka, Kansas, station before attending 
Trinity. It was at this station where 
Dunaway—born Goldsich—would get his pro-
fessional name. 
‘‘I wanted to be J. Michael Wilson or Ray 
Michael Wilson,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘The guy at 
the station said, ‘Nah, I don’t like that 
name. Let’s find another one.’ So, he got the 
phone book and he said, ‘Ray Rodriguez? 
How about Ray Dunaway?’ I said, ‘Sure.’ I 
wanted the job.’’ 
Later, Dunaway worked in Detroit, Dallas 
and Los Angeles before spending 15 years at 
KMBZAM in Kansas City, Missouri, as a 
morning show host. 
In Greater Hartford, Dunaway’s popularity 
has drawn attention to philanthropic causes, 
one of the largest being the annual Salvation 
Army Holiday Store. Dunaway got involved 
soon after arriving in Hartford, broadcasting 
his shows daily from holiday-store locations 
each December. 
The holiday store first started on Pratt 
Street in downtown Hartford and later 
moved to Avon and Glastonbury. 
Salvation 
Army 
Major 
Migdalia 
Lavenbein, area coordinator for Greater 
Hartford, said the holiday store has raised 
millions since Dunaway became involved. 
‘‘Even beyond the money, he has helped 
transform lives; we’re not just talking about 
toys 
and 
food 
and 
monetary 
gifts,’’ 
Lavenbein said. ‘‘He has been in the business 
of helping people who were at the bottom. 
They’ve hit rock bottom, and he’s helped lift 
people up and place them in a position where 
they have hope. You can’t say that about ev-
eryone.’’ 
Dunaway’s last day at WTIC will be when 
the holiday store wraps up for the season on 
Christmas Eve. 
And after that? Well, Dunaway said he has 
to figure out what retirement will be. He 
plans to stay in the area but do some trav-
eling—and read. ‘‘I love to read,’’ he said. 
One thing he is absolutely sure about, 
though is this: ‘‘I just don’t want to see an-
other sunrise,’’ Dunaway said, quickly add-
ing, ‘‘Now don’t take that the wrong way.’’ 
[From the Journal Inquirer, Nov. 22, 2021] 
‘‘DUNAWAY REFLECTS ON 29 YEARS BEHIND 
THE WTIC MICROPHONE’’ 
(By Matt Buckler) 
Ray Dunaway doesn’t sound like a man 
who has had an important job for the past 29 
years. He sounds more as a person who has 
been on a 29-year joyride. Dunaway, 72, who 
announced his retirement Monday from his 
job as morning host at WTIC–AM 1080, re-
members the good times in a job that he 
started in 1992. 
‘‘I love it, it’s been fun,’’ Dunaway said. 
‘‘The station has been good to me. They have 
taken care of me. I love the city. I love the 
area. I’ve worked in Dallas, I’ve worked in 
Detroit, I’ve worked in Los Angeles and I’ve 
worked in Kansas City, but at this radio sta-
tion, WTIC, you can become a key part of 
the community, and I like that. You feel like 
you’re doing something useful.’’ 
When Dunaway arrived at WTIC, replacing 
Tom McCarthy, who replaced the legendary 
Bob Steele, he said he never expected to last 
for 29 years. 
‘‘I hoped,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘But you have to 
be somewhat existential. You live in the 
minute, and if you do well enough, you’ll get 
another minute. Don’t forget, I replaced Tom 
McCarthy and the management told him 
that Bob Steele was here for 60 years and 
you’ll be around for that long. A year later, 
he was gone. So this can be a cruel business. 
You have to live in the minute.’’ 
There have been 29 years, however, of great 
minutes for Dunaway, a Trinity College 
graduate who has been working in radio 
since he was 17. When Dunaway came to 
Hartford from Kansas City, AM radio was in 
a transition period, moving from a music for-
mat to a talk format. Dunaway said he was 
on board with it. 
‘‘The transition had already started with 
Tom McCarthy and I know there was some 
resistance to it,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘But the 
way I look at it, there are so many sources 
for music, especially with the Internet. We 
try to provide local information—local, 
local, local, local. And I worked very hard at 
it, trying to get local people on the show— 
local lawmakers, local town officials. Keep 
the show local. And that’s the one thing that 
you can’t do on the Internet.’’ 
It turned out to be a successful format. 
Dunaway said his program has been an en-
semble show, with contributions from many 
people. His co-hosts have included Robin 
King, 
Diane 
Smith, 
Scott 
Gray, 
Joe 
D’Ambrosio and Brian Shactman, 
‘‘I just like to work with people,’’ Dunaway 
said. ‘‘It’s far easier for me than to keep my 
yap going all the time. I like to bounce off 
other people. It’s always been a team thing 
and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I 
wasn’t born to be a star.’’ 
Dunaway was a star as far as many state 
charities and organizations are concerned. ‘‘I 
had the opportunity to do some incredible 
things,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘I’ve done a lot of 
fundraisers. This station is such a key part 
of the community.’’ 
Dunaway puts at the top of his achieve-
ment list his association with the WTIC–AM 
holiday store, which collects donations for 
the Salvation Army. He will be involved with 
the store one more time this December be-
fore he retires. 
‘‘I dread it, but I also love it,’’ Dunaway 
said. ‘‘I dread it because there is so much 
pressure on us to do well. So many people 
are counting on us. But it usually turns out 
well. That’s why I love it.’’He also loves his 
association with the Manchester Road Race, 
hanging out for the past several years at 
Highland Park Market, a job that started 
‘‘as a lark.’’ 
‘‘It’s great to meet so many people,’’ 
Dunaway said. ‘‘You have to be a little crazy 
to run a race on Thanksgiving morning. And 
there is a lot of craziness that day.’’ 
Dunaway is also crazy about the city of 
Hartford and doesn’t hide his enthusiasm. 
‘‘I have enjoyed watching this city grow, 
and I think I’ve been a part of that,’’ 
Dunaway said. ‘‘Front Street, the Conven-
tion Center, there have been some drastic 
improvements. I want people to be proud of 
this place because it’s a pretty darn good 
place. 
‘‘There was a scene in ‘Midnight Cowboy’ 
where Joe Buck turns on his little radio and 
it’s on WABC and he says, ‘That’s New York 
talking.’ That’s kind of what I tried to do 
here. When someone is listening to us, 
they’ll say, ‘That’s Hartford talking.’ I am 
trying to create a positive image.’’ 
Dunaway said it’s been 29 years of posi-
tivity. 
‘‘The No. 1 thing I’m going to miss are the 
people, I’ve met so many great people,’’ 
Dunaway said. ‘‘I know it sounds like crap, 
but it’s true.’’ 
The one thing he won’t miss is the early 
morning wakeup call. 
‘‘I plan on sleeping in,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘I 
really don’t have any retirement goals. I 
plan to read the paper, write angry letters to 
the editor and be a crank in general. General 
Douglas MacArthur said that old soldiers 
don’t die, they just fade away. Well, I’m 
planning on just fading away.’’ 
His final morning show will take place on 
Friday, Dec. 24. 
‘‘Things will be OK for a week, and then it 
will hit me,’’ Dunaway said. ‘‘I’m not here 
anymore. And I’m really going to miss this 
place. It’s been fun.’’ 
For Dunaway, it wasn’t a job, it was a 
pleasure.

Sports Medicine team of Skaneateles, New 
York, for performing the first fully FDA ap-
proved Bridge-Enhanced ACL Restoration 
(BEAR) Surgery in the United States. 
Across the United States, ACL tears have 
reached alarming rates. According to a 21- 
year study conducted by a team of doctors at 
the Mayo Clinic, 100,000 to 200,000 Ameri-
cans will suffer an ACL tears in a given year.

Surgery paves the way for improved out-
comes, as it is expected to decrease the risk 
of re-injury and injuries to the opposite knee, 
feelings of post-recovery abnormality, and ar-
thritis caused by the ACL injury. 
In Central New York, Dr. Marc Pietropaoli 
and the Victory Sports Medicine are on the 
cutting edge of orthopedic procedures. The 
successful BEAR procedure is among a long 
list of achievements this team has had and 
represents a new era of repairing ACL tears. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing Dr. Marc 
Pietropaoli and the Victory Sports Medicine 
team for performing the first fully FDA ap-

IN HONOR OF JEFF AZZOPARDI 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor South San Francisco Police Chief Jeff 
Azzopardi on the occasion of his retirement. 
After almost 30 years of service with the de-
partment, Chief Azzopardi has decided that it 
is time for a new chapter in his life that will 
allow him to spend more time with his family. 
I had the great honor to work with Chief 
Azzopardi since he was appointed in 2014. 
One of the more memorable occasions was a 
press conference in 2017 in which we an-
nounced the first-ever conviction for human 
trafficking in San Mateo County. That success 
reflected the outstanding collaboration of law 
enforcement, elected officials, and nonprofit 
organizations on the local, state, and federal 
level. Chief Azzopardi played an essential role 
in that collaboration. 
Jeff Azzopardi was hired as a police recruit 
for the South San Francisco Police Depart-
ment and sworn in as an officer in 1993. From 
there he rose through the ranks of K–9 officer, 
S.W.A.T. officer, school community liaison offi-
cer, police corporal, criminal investigations bu-
reau officer, police sergeant, community rela-
tions sergeant, police lieutenant, criminal in-
vestigations bureau commander, and police 
captain. After the retirement of former Chief 
Mike Massoni in 2014, the department con-
ducted a nationwide search and selected Jeff 
Azzopardi as its new chief in September of 
that year. No matter the role, Jeff is dedicated 
to the safety and well-being of our community. 
He leads by example and always strives for 
excellence. 
During his time with the department, he suc-
cessfully completed the Inner Perspectives 
Leadership Program, LAPD Leadership Pro-
gram, and POST Executive Development 
course. He holds a number of certifications 
from the California Commission on Peace Offi-
cer Standards and Training. He also is the 
former president of the San Mateo County 
Commanders Group, the president of the San 
Mateo County Police Chief’s and Sheriffs As-
sociation, and the Chief of the North Central 
Regional S.W.A.T. Team and Commissioner 
for the South San Francisco Commission on 
Racial and Social Equity. Chief Azzopardi un-
derstands the importance of community rela-
tions and has been a leader on several com-
munity oriented policing projects. He tirelessly 
emphasized the importance of building bridges 
between his department and our community. 
His outstanding service did not go unno-
ticed. He received numerous awards and hon-
ors, including a certificate of commendation 
from the police department for his work as a 
sexual assault investigator, a certificate of 
commendation from the San Mateo County 
Board of Supervisors, a lifetime achievement 
award from the South San Francisco Chamber 
of Commerce, the Carl Valero Lifetime 
Achievement Award from Pacifica American 
Little League, and Police Officer of the Year 
from the San Mateo County Trial Lawyers As-
sociation. 
Born in San Francisco, Jeff attended Terra 
Nova High School in Pacifica and then re-
ceived his Bachelor’s Degree in Public Admin-
istration from Chico State University and his 
Master’s Degree in Public Administration from 
Notre Dame de Namur University. 
As South San Francisco’s Top Cop is leav-
ing his post, he is looking forward to spending 
more time with his wife of 21 years, Nikole, 
and their sons Nate and Drew. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join with me to 
thank Chief Azzopardi for keeping South San 
Francisco one of the safest and most innova-
tive cities in the Bay Area. His exemplary 
leadership has earned him the respect and 
adoration of his colleagues and South City 
residents. His contributions over the last three 
decades will outlast his service.

RECOGNIZING CHAIRMAN CURTIS 
W. CRANDALL ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize Curtis W. Crandall, Chairman, on 
his retirement from the Allegany County Legis-
lature. 
Chairman Crandall was appointed to the 
Legislature on March 13, 2000 to replace 
Alton Sylor. His service continued for nearly 
twenty-two years, sixteen of which were as 
Chairman. He was Majority Leader for one 
year, in 2005, before obtaining the Chairman-
ship. In his years of dedication to Allegany 
County, Chairman Crandall was a member of 
every committee, acting in various leadership 
roles including Chair of the Special Budget 
Committee in 2016 and 2017. 
Chairman Crandall has been active on Advi-
sory Boards throughout his tenure as well. 
Over the years, he served on the Citizens Ad-
visory Council to the Office for the Aging from 
February 2003 to January 2006, Public Safety 
Building Planning Committee from January to 
December 2005, Court Facilities Financial Im-
pact Ad Hoc Committee from November 
through December 2008, Comprehensive Plan 
Implementation Group from October 2008 
through December 2009, and continues long-
standing terms of service on the Broadband 
Task Force, Crossroads Development Advi-
sory Committee, and Radio Communications 
Task Force. Additionally, Chairman Crandall 
has been the ex-officio member of the South-
ern Tier West Regional Planning & Economic 
Development Board since January of 2006. 
Chairman Crandall worked tirelessly for his 
constituents, and we are thankful for his ef-
forts in reducing the county property tax rate 
for 
many 
consecutive 
years. 
Chairman 
Crandall’s commitment to his community goes 
above and beyond as shown through his vol-
unteer work with the Lions Club, Boy Scouts 
of America, and Farm Bureau, just to name a 
few. 
As a successful entrepreneur and business-
man of over forty years, a loyal member of the 
Legislature, faithful volunteer and a loving hus-
band, father and grandfather, we applaud his 
valued leadership and dedicated service as he 
moves forward in the next chapter of his life. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me in 
recognizing Allegany County Legislative Chair-
man, Curtis W. Crandall, on his longstanding 
service and retirement. Congratulations on this 
tremendous milestone.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MARYAM ANSARI MEHRAN 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of 
Maryam Ansari Mehran. 
Maryam Ansari Mehran was born in Tehran, 
Iran in 1922 to Monavar and General 
Mahmoud Ansari. Maryam graduated from the 
American College in Tehran and shortly after 
married Masud Mehran. The couple then de-
cided to come to the United States in pursuit 
of new opportunities. Maryam and Masud ar-
rived in New York City in 1943 and later 
moved to California. 
Maryam’s entrepreneurial spirit was evident 
to all who knew her. In 1951, Maryam and 
Masud founded Sunset Development Com-
pany. The company was responsible for the 
development of more than one third of homes 
in Livermore, California. Maryam was also 
very interested in design. She graduated from 
the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design and 
went on to start a custom clothing business. 
In her personal life, Maryam was also deep-
ly passionate about her community. She was 
a strong supporter of the Contra Costa Food 
Bank, helping those in need. Her love for her 
family was also clear. She enjoyed tending her 
garden for her family to enjoy. 
Sadly, Maryam passed away in November 
of this year. Maryam is survived by her son 
Alex, her granddaughters Diana, Lacey and 
Annabel, her grandsons Mark, Rawley and 
Alexander and eleven great grandchildren She 
was a cherished member of our community 
and will be remembered for her intelligence, 
compassion, and perseverance. Please join 
me in honoring Maryam for her many contribu-
tions to our community.

December 23, 2021 
Scott Bohn upon his completion of the Brook-
ings Institution’s LEGIS Fellowship program. 
During the 2021 calendar year, Mr. Bohn 
served as my U.S. State Department fellow 
and quickly became an integral part of my leg-
islative staff. 
His working knowledge as a State Depart-
ment employee and veteran informed my work 
as Chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness and as a mem-
ber of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. 
Over this past year, he worked closely with my 
personal office staff and other Congressional 
offices on a variety of critical issues. He 
helped to reconstitute my Congressional Nu-
clear Weapons and Arms Control Working 
Group, which focuses on nuclear arms control, 
risk reduction, and nonproliferation. He also 
worked to advance my bipartisan ‘‘Peace 
Corps Reauthorization Act,’’ which the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee reported favorably 
in September 2021. 
Mr. Bohn graduated from the University of 
Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Philosophy in 
politics and philosophy, and from Georgetown 
University with a Master of Arts in Russian 
and East European studies. 
A career employee at the U.S. Department 
of State, Mr. Bohn most recently led the over-
seas security advisory council’s global threat 
warning team, responsible for monitoring, ana-
lyzing, and sharing time-sensitive security in-
formation relevant to U.S. private sector oper-
ations overseas. Previously, Mr. Bohn served 
in the Office of Intelligence and Threat Anal-
ysis as an analyst evaluating threats to U.S. 
interests in Europe and Eurasia. In addition, 
he performed a rotational tour in the Depart-
ment’s Office of Russian Affairs, where he 
worked to advance U.S. bilateral policy inter-
ests with Russia. 
Mr. Bohn is also a Foreign Area Officer in 
the Air Force Reserve, currently assigned to 
the U.S. Air Forces in Europe Headquarters. 
Previous assignments included tours at the 
Pentagon, Defense Intelligence Agency, Office 
of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intel-
ligence, and National Security Agency. Mr. 
Bohn and his wife, Megan, have two daugh-
ters: Isabel and Olivia. His family continues to 
support him and his service to our nation, and 
we thank them for it. 
While Mr. Bohn will be deeply missed after 
an exceptional year of service, he will no 
doubt be successful in his new role in the Of-
fice of Verification, Planning, and Outreach at 
the State Department’s Bureau of Arms Con-
trol, Verification, and Compliance. Despite his 
departure, he will remain a deeply valued 
member of Team Garamendi. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
California’s Third Congressional district and a 
grateful nation, I extend our deepest apprecia-
tion to Mr. Scott Bohn for his dedicated serv-
ice.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PERRY 
MASTROCOLA 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor 
and 
celebrate 
the 
life 
of 
Perry 
Mastrocola, a dedicated public servant, a gift-
ed attorney and educator, and a devoted and 
loving husband and father who passed away 
in early October. 
Perry served our nation for more than 27 
years as both a Federal Special Agent and a 
Federal Prosecutor. During his distinguished 
career, Perry served as a special agent with 
the IRS Criminal Investigation division and 
later in supervisory roles in IRS offices in 
Cleveland and Charlotte. Perry had extensive 
experience investigating criminal tax offenses, 
money laundering violations, health care fraud, 
bank secrecy act matters, and other complex 
financial crimes. He retired as the Special 
Agent in Charge of the IRS office in Charlotte. 
Following his service in the Federal Govern-
ment, Perry worked as a Senior Investigator 
and Analyst for U.S. Bank’s Investigation and 
Enhanced Due Diligence departments. There, 
he was responsible for leading sophisticated 
internal bank investigations and preparing rec-
ommendations in cases involving fraud or 
other unusual circumstances. He later joined 
Flannery Georgalis, a leading litigation firm in 
Charlotte, as a Partner. 
Perry was multi-lingual and because of his 
unique and dynamic language capabilities, he 
worked with Italian and Mexican authorities on 
many important money laundering investiga-
tions. He also taught Anti-Money Laundering 
classes to Mexican law enforcement officers 
and was a keynote speaker in numerous Anti- 
Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy semi-
nars for finance and law enforcement rep-
resentatives around the country. Perry also 
taught undergraduate law classes at his un-
dergraduate alma mater, Baldwin-Wallace Uni-
versity, for 14 years. 
Perry was a huge Ohio football fan, actively 
supporting a variety of teams from the Bald-
win-Wallace Yellow Jackets to the Cleveland 
Browns. And he spent countless hours coach-
ing sports teams for his sons, Vincent and Ga-
briel—because what mattered most to Perry 
was his family and especially his loving wife of 
27 years, Kelly. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in remembering Perry 
Mastrocola, honoring his many years of serv-
ice to our country, and keeping both he and 
his family in our thoughts and prayers.

NAMED TOM WINNING THE VOICE 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding musical trio 
who won NBC’s The Voice. Girl Named Tom 
has overcome many challenges and intense 
competition on their path to becoming the 
champions. Natives of Pettisville, Ohio, Caleb, 
Bekah, and Joshua Liechty have represented 
their hometown and Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District on a national stage and brought 
pride to Northwest Ohio. This trio exemplifies 
American values of family, community, and 
hard work. 
Caleb, Bekah, and Joshua were raised in 
Pettisville. They were originally homeschooled, 
and music became a substantial part of their 
curriculum. All three siblings were enrolled in 
piano at a young age, and they became in-
volved in theater once they started at 
Pettisville Schools. The entire trio had plans to 
go to medical school and follow in their grand-
father’s footsteps, but all of that changed 
when their father was diagnosed with a rare 
cancer in 2017. The siblings decided to form 
a band and pursue a career in music. 
After a successful season on The Voice, 
Girl Named Tom was honored with the distinc-
tion of being the first group to ever win the 
competition and the recording contract. Caleb, 
Bekah, and Joshua hope to keep pursuing 
their dream and release new music in 2022. 
As for now, they plan on celebrating their suc-
cess and spending time with their father. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Caleb, Bekah, 
and Joshua Liechty of Girl Named Tom for 
their momentous win. On behalf of the Fifth 
District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this 
great achievement and wish Girl Named Tom 
the best in all their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
ERIE COUNTY SHERIFF TIMOTHY 
B. HOWARD 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in recognition of Erie County Sher-
iff Timothy B. Howard for a long and dedicated 
career in law enforcement and public service. 
Sheriff Howard’s career has spanned over 
four decades, including 24 years with the New 
York State Police, where he reached the rank 
of Staff Inspector, the fourth highest rank in an 
agency comprised of over 4,000 employees. 
In 1998, Sheriff Howard was appointed Erie 
County Undersheriff, and served in that role 
until he became Sheriff on January 1, 2005 
due to the resignation of the previous Erie 
County Sheriff. Sheriff Howard was elected for 
his first full four-year term in 2005, and was 
re-elected in 2009, 2013, and 2017. Sheriff 
Howard is also the longest-serving Erie Coun-
ty Sheriff since 1821, when the post was es-
tablished—a testament to his dedication to 
serving Erie Country, and the positive impact 
he has had on the county. Sheriff Howard also 
currently serves as the co-chair of Homeland 
Security Zone 15. 
Sheriff Howard is a true law and order Sher-
iff, and he has demonstrated his heroism and 
commitment to his community throughout his 
career. Among Sheriff Howard’s many notable 
awards, he has received the Superintendent’s 
Unit Citation Award, the Hero’s Award of the 
100 Club of Buffalo, the Erie County Law En-
forcement Award, the Judges and Police Con-
ference Outstanding Law Enforcement Award, 
the 
Attorney 
General’s 
Award, 
and 
the 
Brummer Award, which is highest award given 
in the New York State Police. Sheriff Howard 
has also received a New York State Legisla-
tive Proclamation in honor of his work. 
Sheriff Howard graduated from the FBI Na-
tional Academy in 2000 and has a master’s 
degree in Criminal Justice from SUNY Albany. 
In addition to his tireless work protecting the 
community, Sheriff Howard has prioritized 
educating the next generation of law enforce-
ment officers—teaching at both the New York

State Police Academy and the Rochester Insti-
tute of Technology. 
After a long and remarkable career in law 
enforcement, Sheriff Howard is leaving his 
post to pursue a new opportunity as the Su-
pervisor of the Town of Wales. Words cannot 
express the debt of gratitude the people of 
Erie County owe to Sheriff Howard for his dec-
ades of work taking dangerous criminals off 
the street, rescuing those in danger, and im-
proving every community he has touched. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Sheriff Howard on his retirement, in 
thanking him for service, and in honoring the 
positive impact he has had on Erie County.

RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING 
THE CAREER OF DANICE STAN-
TON TAYLOR 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize and celebrate the career of one of my 
original staff members, Danice Stanton Taylor. 
Danice started on January 27, 1997 and was 
hired as a caseworker. She focused on case-
work involving the Social Security Administra-
tion, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices, healthcare and disabilities. Fittingly, she 
is moving to a job with the La Crosse Social 
Security Office, where she can continue to 
help people with their Social Security ques-
tions or issues. 
She was born and raised in the Town of 
Mifflin, Wisconsin, a small town in the driftless 
region of Southwest Wisconsin. She grad-
uated from Iowa-Grant High School and went 
on to graduate from UW-Platteville with a 
Bachelor of Science in Political Science. After 
graduation, she worked for Senator Russ 
Feingold for two years even doing a stint in 
Washington, DC. Her Wisconsin roots brought 
her back and I was lucky to have her join my 
staff in my La Crosse District Office. Danice 
and her husband Mike are raising three tal-
ented and creative children, Alec, Jackie and 
Olivia. It has been fun watching them grow up 
throughout these years. 
Danice has been a steady, patient and 
friendly voice to the constituents of Wiscon-
sin’s 3rd Congressional District. I could always 
count on her to provide thorough and excellent 
assistance to the people I represent. Through-
out her years of service, she has joined me on 
the road for countless listening sessions. Addi-
tionally, she served as the staff leader on the 
annual Congressional Art Competition. 
There were many times when I received a 
letter, email, phone call, or had a personal 
conversation 
with 
someone 
who 
Danice 
helped and how grateful they were for her as-
sistance. It can truly be said that she served 
the people well and serves as a great exam-
ple of what good public service looks like. 
I thank Danice for her hard work and dedi-
cation and 24 years of public service to my of-
fice and to the people of Wisconsin’s 3rd Con-
gressional District. I wish her, Mike and her 
children all the best in their next chapter. 
HONORING CITY ADMINISTRATOR 
OF 
FULTON, 
MISSOURI, 
BILL 
JOHNSON 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a man who has dedicated 
his life to public service and bring attention to 
the communities he has improved. After twen-
ty-five years as the City Administrator of Ful-
ton, Missouri, Bill Johnson is retiring. 
Over the last 25 years, Mr. Johnson 
oversaw countless meaningful projects, includ-
ing, but not limited to, construction of a new 
city hall building, police station, fire station, 
animal shelter, warehouse complex, recreation 
center, golf course, and an airport runway. 
The list of major accomplishments doesn’t 
stop there. He was able to achieve upgrades 
for water and wastewater utilities, rebuilding of 
natural gas and electric delivery systems, im-
provements to the sanitary sewer system, and 
much more. 
Mr. Johnson also promoted Fulton at the 
state, national and international level through 
his participation in organizations like the Inter-
national City Management Association, Mis-
souri Municipal League, and Missouri State 
Homeland Security Committee to name a few. 
In 2014 Mr. Johnson was awarded the J.T. 
Bell Award for the ‘‘City Manager of the Year’’ 
for the State of Missouri. This award, given by 
his peers, is evidence of Mr. Johnson’s value 
to the community and commitment to efficient, 
effective government. 
It is not surprising that a man who has so 
passionately dedicated his adult life to public 
service started that service in the U.S. military. 
Mr. Johnson is a veteran of the U.S. Marine 
Corps where he received three Meritorious 
Masts and the Good Conduct Medal during his 
Service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Mr. Johnson on his accomplish-
ments as the City Administrator of Fulton and 
a well-deserved retirement. More importantly, 
please help me thank him and his family for 
their service to the city, the community, and 
our entire nation.

HONORING THE LIVES OF DOYLE 
ORVAL ‘‘KORN BREAD’’ COWART, 
SR. AND CATHY ANNE MOORE 
COWART 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of my friend, Doyle 
Orval ‘‘Korn Bread’’ Cowart, and his wife, 
Kathy Anne Moore Cowart, both of whom 
passed away on Thursday, December 16, 
2021. 
Doyle was born in Colmesneil, Texas, on 
September 10, 1937, to Doyle and Trudie 
Cowart. He worked as a supervisor in the pe-
trochemical industry for 38 years before retir-
ing. Doyle had a passion for syrup making, 
trail riding, and farming. Doyle and I served to-
gether in The Gideons International. Kathy 
was born on February 22, 1940, also in 
Colmesneil, Texas, to Moot and Alice Moore. 
She worked as a bank teller for 40 years be-
fore retiring. Kathy’s passions were hospitality, 
gardening, and community fellowship. 
Doyle and Kathy were high school sweet-
hearts, and their love led to a wonderful mar-
riage. They spent 63 lovely years together be-
fore going home to be with their Lord and 
Savior. The couple were lifelong residents of 
Colmesneil, Texas, and devoted members of 
First Baptist Church Colmesneil, where Doyle 
served as a Deacon and Kathy sang in the 
choir. Doyle and Kathy never met a stranger 
and welcomed all into their home to share a 
warm meal, a time of prayer, and the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. Together, they built the Gath-
ering Place, an event venue, in Colmesneil 
which served as a perfect representation of 
the passion they shared for their community, 
fellowship, and Christ’s love. 
Doyle and Kathy were preceded in death by 
their parents, Doyle Cleveland, Trudie Ollie 
Davis Cowart, Moot Jacob, and Alice Victoria 
Woodward Moore. They are survived by their 
daughter, Amy Hornsby of Anahuac, Texas; 
son, Doyle Orval Cowart, Jr. and his wife, 
Shelley, of Port Neches, Texas; son, Jerry 
Vance Cowart, and his wife, Tina Cowart, of 
Colmesneil, Texas; Kathy’s brother, L.B. 
Hanks, and his wife, Joyce, of Port Neches, 
Texas; and her sisters, Wilma Jo Thweatt and 
Iris Gall, of San Antonio, Texas. They also 
leave behind their grandchildren: Amanda 
Abshier, Heath Abshier, Harlie Cowart, Kallie 
Cowart, Travis Cowart, and Brandon Cowart 
and his wife, Clara, and their great-grand-
children: Bella Abshier, Maddox Abshier, Bent-
ley Abshier, Thomas Cowart, Peyton Cowart, 
and Paisley Cowart. 
Madam Speaker, today, please join me in 
remembering Doyle and Kathy Cowart, two 
Godly people who will be missed. My heartfelt 
prayers remain with their family and friends 
during this difficult time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PAUL 
BALDACCI 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 23, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Paul Baldacci. 
Paul was born in Virginia in 1933 and raised 
in Akron, Ohio. Paul enjoyed playing football 
and basketball throughout high school. After 
graduation, he went on to play offensive guard 
at Santa Clara University on a football scholar-
ship and later attended the University of San 
Francisco School of Law. However, his edu-
cation was put on hold as he joined the United 
States Army in 1956 and served in the Korean 
War. 
After serving in the Army, Paul eventually 
joined Hoffman Company Builders and Devel-
opers where Paul realized his passion for de-
velopment. Paul later went on to start Castle 
Construction Company Inc. Throughout his ca-
reer, Paul was very passionate about sup-
porting the interests of industrial workers. He 
served for over thirty years as Employer Trust-
ee for the Northern California Carpenters 46 
Counties Apprenticeship Training Trust. In 
1999, Paul was appointed as a member of the
