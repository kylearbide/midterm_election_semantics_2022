RECOGNIZING CLAY HENRY ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the retirement of 
one of Arkansas’ most-admired sports 
journalists, Clay Henry. 
Clay has retired after decades of cov-
ering Arkansas Razorback athletics, 
notably the publisher of Hawgs Illus-
trated, the weekly publication dedi-
cated to the coverage of our beloved 
Hogs. 
It was natural for Clay, given that he 
was the son of another sports legend in 
Arkansas journalism, Orville Henry. I 
am quite confident his introduction to 
Razorback sports was while he was still 
in diapers. Then later as a stat man for 
the Arkansas Gazette at the age of 14. 
He was produced by the best, tutored 
by the best, and like those before him, 
became the best. 
Stops along the way at publications 
like 
the 
Log 
Cabin 
Democrat 
in 
Conway and the Tulsa World helped 
prepare him for a gig in 1992 with a new 
Arkansas magazine called Hawgs Illus-
trated. Leaving the Tulsa World for an 
upstart might have been a tough deci-
sion for a lot of people, but with Clay, 
it just seemed a natural fit. After all, 
Clay was a Hog, not a Sooner. 
Clay partnered to buy the publica-
tion with George Billingsley before 
eventually selling to Stephens Media, 
then later to the Hussman Company, 
WEHCO Media, which became the sole 
owner. In every step, the common de-
nominator that found its way into the 
mailboxes of Hog fans everywhere was 
Clay Henry. Lots of contributing writ-
ers, 
amazing 
photographers, 
great 
salesmen, but only one Clay Henry. He 
served 27 years as publisher. 
Now, it is off to the Norfork River 
where the trout now have a full-time 
enemy—that is, when Jean Ann, his 
bride of 43 years doesn’t have him 
doing honey-dos, or assuming the Ra-
zorbacks don’t come calling. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Clay 
for a journalism career of enormous 
success and professionalism. The Hog 
Nation is forever grateful. 
CANOO 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, more 
than a half century ago, Americans 
walked on the Moon for the first time. 
Now, a new lunar mission is upon us in 
2024, and the Third District of Arkan-
sas will support this next step in space 
exploration. 
NASA has chosen Canoo, a high-tech 
mobility 
company 
with 
announced 
headquarters and facilities in north-
west Arkansas, to produce a transpor-
tation fleet for astronauts, part of the 
Artemis program. That is right, as the 
crew prepares for their historic launch, 
they will be moved by state-of-the-art 
vehicles manufactured in Bentonville, 
Arkansas. 
A demonstration of ingenuity and 
the Natural State’s focus on harnessing 
emerging technology and novel ideas, 
great things can be achieved when the 
public and private sectors work to-
gether. 
I am so proud that the future of 
space discovery is being supported by 
the Third District and our incredible 
workforce. The pioneering spirit of Ar-
kansas and America will be on display 
as fully suited astronauts ride to their 
liftoff location. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Canoo for the role they are playing in 
such an incredible moment in Amer-
ican history. From Arkansas to the 
Moon—and eventually on to Mars— 
their work is driving innovation for-
ward. 
f 
CANCELING SUBSCRIPTIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, try-
ing to cancel a subscription can take 
you in as many circles as looking for 
summertime 
parking 
at 
Newport 
Beach. I have experienced it myself. 
For too long, dishonest companies 
have gotten away with trapping Ameri-
cans 
into 
subscriptions 
by 
inten-
tionally making it easy to start and 
nearly impossible to stop. As a long-
time consumer advocate, I am pleased 
that the Federal Trade Commission is 
now holding corporations accountable 
for this abusive practice. 
The FTC has made it clear that busi-
nesses should make it as straight-
forward for customers to unsubscribe

as it was to sign up. If they don’t and 
they lock consumers in with abusive 
practices, they will face penalties. Po-
licing unfair and deceptive business 
practices makes our capitalist econ-
omy stronger, safer, and more competi-
tive. That is the FTC’s job, and I am 
glad they are a cop on the consumer 
protection beat. 
I am committed to saving Orange 
County families time and money. If a 
company won’t let you cancel a sub-
scription, you can report this fraud on 
the FTC’s website or contact my office 
for help. 
SECURE DAVID LIN’S RELEASE 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of David Lin who, has 
been imprisoned in China since 2006 on 
charges of contract fraud. 
Although the Chinese Government 
has reduced David’s sentence, the fact 
remains that David has been separated 
from his family for nearly 16 years and 
may die in prison. He has already 
missed his children’s graduations, his 
daughter’s wedding, and the birth of 
his grandchild. 
At age 67, his health is declining, and 
he may never have the opportunity to 
hold his grandchildren or see his family 
again. Recently, his daughter was diag-
nosed with breast cancer. This is ur-
gent. 
Americans wrongfully detained over-
seas should be allowed to come home to 
their loved ones, and I urge President 
Biden to continue doing everything in 
his power to secure David’s release. 
SOUTHWEST CARPENTERS VISIT 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, Or-
ange County infrastructure is getting 
an upgrade because of Federal funds. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
wear an orange safety vest and a hard 
hat and join the Southwest Regional 
Council of Carpenters Local 714 at one 
of their job sites. I saw firsthand how 
they are working to improve our free-
ways and keep families safe. Their 
commitment to quality work was an 
inspiration. 
This project will improve 16 miles of 
the 405 in Orange County. It will re-
vamp road conditions and upgrade 
bridges with safer sidewalks and bike 
lanes. It was paid for, in part, through 
Federal funds. 
I was proud to support the bipartisan 
infrastructure law, which makes addi-
tional investments to create millions 
of jobs and strengthen our economy. 
This law will make necessary infra-
structure projects possible, and I will 
continue supporting Federal legisla-
tion that brings resources back home 
to Orange County. 
f 
INFLATION—FOOD AND WATER 
SHORTAGES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, we 
are dealing with an awful lot of grave 
issues. Indeed, they become crises when 
they aren’t managed correctly in this 
country. 
So we are hearing a lot about infla-
tion and feeling the effects, especially 
regular people, middle-income people, 
lower-middle-income 
people, 
low-in-
come people are being harmed by the 
policies put forth the last year and a 
quarter. 
We hear a lot about how Americans 
are paying more: 
Vehicles. You can’t hardly find a new 
vehicle, and the price of used vehicles 
has skyrocketed. 
Gas at the pump. Do I need to talk 
about that anymore? 
Lodging. 
Airline fares to even get us to our 
jobs here in Washington, D.C., but for 
regular people on vacation and doing 
their business as well. 
What 
isn’t 
being 
talked 
about 
enough? The cost of food and the avail-
ability of food. 
Inflation is hitting it hard, too. 
Cost of inputs. 
In my home State, lack of water. 
Lack of water in California. 
Why does that matter to the rest of 
the country? Well, I will tell you. 
Farms and ranches produce about $50 
billion in output in California, but 
there needs to be water for the crops. 
Environmental laws are forcing the 
release of water down the rivers and 
out to the oceans for coho salmon, 
delta smelt, et cetera. 
Our agriculture sector in California 
is the most important in the United 
States. There are a lot of other very 
important sectors as well. 
We lead the Nation in over 77 dif-
ferent crops, including many fruit and 
vegetable specialty crops. Our top com-
modities are milk, almonds, grapes, 
cattle and calves, strawberries, pis-
tachios, lettuce, walnuts, floriculture, 
tomatoes, rice, broilers, carrots, hay, 
broccoli, tangerines, oranges, and lem-
ons, to name a few. 
Our State is the only producer— 
which means 99 percent or more—of al-
monds, artichokes, celery, figs, garlic, 
honeydew, nectarines, olives, peaches, 
sweet rice, and walnuts. 
For almonds, California grows all the 
domestic production, and 77 percent of 
global production comes from Cali-
fornia. 
So it is kind of important that the 
water flows through our State. That is 
one of the important inputs that we 
are short on. 
I talked about the energy costs. On 
my own farm, we are fortunate enough 
to have a fairly decent water allocation 
where I live in my part of the State, 
but I have neighbors to the west and 
south of me receiving, in some cases, 
zero percent allocations. Zero. 
Take rice production, for example. It 
is going to be down probably by about 
half. As a rice grower that gravely con-
cerns me, but as a food producer, and 
all of you as food consumers, you need 
to be greatly concerned. These policies 
can be avoided. We still have a point 
that we can save this springtime and 
get crops planted with water that is 
available presently. 
Instead, 
we 
are 
watching 
world 
events here. Ukraine, their farmers are 
dodging bombs right now trying to get 
crops planted. Russia has actually been 
somewhat of an important exporter, 
not so much to this country but we im-
port some things from them: fertilizer, 
some of our energy. 
We need to be putting a stop to that 
and become self-sufficient like we can. 
We should have energy independence. 
We had that up until a year ago. 
So we are going to keep shorting our-
selves on crops growing because of en-
vironmental laws, taking the water 
away, shifting it to a fish that doesn’t 
even exist in the delta anymore in 
northern California, the smelt. Tril-
lions of gallons of water going out into 
the ocean and fields being idled; perma-
nent crops being destroyed; trees and 
vines just dying because there is no 
water for them. 
We are going to feel that. We are al-
ready feeling it in the stores. When you 
can go to a major supermarket and see 
a whole freezer section has nothing in 
it, in the United States of America, 
that blows my mind. We can grow plen-
ty here, and we always have until these 
times. Environmental laws are trump-
ing what people need. Bad energy pol-
icy is driving the cost of everything. 
Some of the fertilizer I have to put 
on my crops has over doubled in price. 
That all has to be made up somewhere. 
Either the farmer eats it and goes out 
of business, or it has to be made up on 
a store shelf. Somewhere along the 
chain it has to be made up for. 
We can produce the energy that pro-
duces fertilizer that fuels the tractors, 
the trucks, the combines, everything it 
takes to bring a crop in, we can 
produce it here. We are capable of it. 
Yet, we are being paralyzed by policies 
at the Federal level and at my home 
State level as well. 
One of the ideas in the legislature on 
top of everything, on top of this $6 gas 
we have in California, is to add more 
gas tax on top of that by our State leg-
islature. 
That is not your problem, the rest of 
the country. I mean, sometimes we are 
a comic show at what we do out there, 
and we get laughed at by the rest of 
the country, but we won’t fix it here. It 
needs to be fixed there. 
Don’t do what we do, okay, rest of 
the country? 
We need to set policy here where we 
can in Congress at the Federal level 
that brings us energy independence and 
helps put food back on the table in-
stead of taking the water away and 
raising the costs of everything so much 
that we can’t farm this country any-
more.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF ART 
FRANKLIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a pioneer of broadcast 
journalism, news anchor Art Franklin, 
who will be making his departure from 
CBS 42 in Birmingham, Alabama, on 
Friday, April 29. 
Art Franklin is a multiple Emmy 
Award-winning journalist whose broad-
cast career has spanned more than 38 
years and earned him more than 100 
community and journalism awards, in-
cluding two Emmy Awards. And, most 
recently, he was awarded an Edward R. 
Murrow Award in 2021 for excellence in 
innovation as anchor of CBS 42’s 
Coronavirus House Calls. 
Art currently anchors the CBS 42 
Evening News at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 
and 10 p.m., after returning to Bir-
mingham to anchor the CBS 42 Morn-
ing News with Art Franklin, and served 
as a managing editor. 
Art first came to Birmingham in 1991 
and spent 12 years at WBRC-TV, where 
he was a trailblazer, becoming Bir-
mingham’s 
first 
African-American 
male to anchor in prime time. 
During his career of almost four dec-
ades, Art has worked as a radio an-
nouncer, a radio news director, a pro-
duction manager, a talk show host of 
both radio and television, a television 
news producer, host of a television pub-
lic affairs show, and the producer of 
the National Association of Black 
Journalist Awards show that was aired 
on BET. 
In addition to his time as a jour-
nalist, Art was the CEO of Atlanta- 
based independent record company 285 
Records. 
The author of a book, ‘‘Give It All 
You Got,’’ Art launched in 2021 the Art 
Franklin Collection, a clothing line of 
men’s ties, bow ties, shirts, and custom 
suits. 
Art sits on numerous boards in the 
State of Alabama. He is an avid cook 
and tennis player, and he is a proud 
member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing Art Franklin for his extraor-
dinary career and contributions to 
broadcast journalism. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Art. 
We in Birmingham are so proud of all 
that he has done, and we wish him 
much luck in his endeavors. 
RECOGNIZING PRINCETON BAPTIST MEDICAL 
CENTER’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of Princeton Baptist Medical Cen-
ter and Baptist Health System in Bir-
mingham, Alabama. 
For a century, the Princeton Baptist 
Medical Center has been dedicated to 
serving the most vulnerable in our 
communities by prioritizing commu-
nity health and expanding access to 
healthcare. 
As a faith-based hospital, Princeton 
was built on the premise that it would 
provide services to patients, regardless 
of their ability to pay. During its first 
day of operation, Princeton served 39 
patients, with 11 more admitted by the 
day’s end, without any operating cap-
ital. 
Since then, the Princeton Baptist 
Medical Center began expanding rap-
idly, undergoing multiple major hos-
pital renovations. As the hospital’s in-
frastructure grew, so did its network, 
expanding to meet the needs of its pa-
tients by adding new departments to 
expand critical services and research, 
as well as to keep abreast of the latest 
medical developments. 
During the 1990s, additional hospitals 
joined Princeton Baptist to build one 
of our State’s largest and most com-
prehensive network of acute-care hos-
pitals: The Brookwood Baptist Health. 
Since its humble beginnings, Prince-
ton Baptist Medical Center has re-
mained 
active 
in 
the 
community, 
hosting several residency and men-
toring programs. It even became the 
first healthcare center in the United 
States to implement a pastoral edu-
cation program and student internship. 
Now, with more than 230 physicians, 
an additional 1,700 employees, and 505 
licensed hospital beds, Princeton Bap-
tist Medical Center continues to be a 
centerpiece in our Birmingham com-
munity. I am honored to be their part-
ner in our fight to expand healthcare 
access to all Alabamians. 
I am proud to honor Princeton Bap-
tist Medical Center for its profound 
contributions to our community as 
they celebrate 100 years of service. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Princeton 
Baptist Medical Center. 
f 
MAKING EVERY AMERICAN TOWN 
A BORDER TOWN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, reports 
of clandestine flights taking thousands 
of illegal immigrants across the coun-
try on behalf of U.S. taxpayers are ex-
tremely concerning. 
In his 45 years as a United States 
Senator, and Vice President, and now 
President, Joe Biden has sworn to de-
fend the U.S. Constitution from all en-
emies, foreign and domestic, on eight 
separate occasions, presumably includ-
ing invasions of our border. Nowhere in 
the Constitution does it describe using 
taxpayer dollars to transport illegal 
immigrants to every corner of this 
country. 
Employees of the airline in question 
are fearful that they may be partici-
pating in human trafficking as unac-
companied minors are on many of 
these flights. 
Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary 
Mayorkas 
must 
answer 
whether American taxpayers are pay-
ing for these secret flights and, if so, 
why. All parties involved should be 
held accountable, including President 
Biden. 
None of this would be an issue if we 
had just followed through on President 
Trump’s plan to build a wall at our 
southern border and secure our bor-
ders. Instead, President Biden seems 
determined to make every town in 
America a border town. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MILLARD 
VAUGHN OAKLEY 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the late Millard Vaughn Oak-
ley, one of the greatest Tennesseeans I 
have every known. His legacy will live 
on in our State’s history for genera-
tions to come. 
He started life as a shoeshine on the 
Livingston, 
Tennessee, 
square, 
and 
checked out as a multimillionaire, 
chasing the excitement of the next 
great business deal or opportunity or 
challenge. He was a faithful husband, a 
loving father, and grandfather, an ex-
emplary public servant, and a pas-
sionate believer in his small town and 
the surrounding region. 
If you took a trip to Overton County, 
Tennessee, you wouldn’t have to look 
far to find someone directly blessed by 
Millard Vaughn Oakley. That is cer-
tainly true for me. 
We come from opposing political par-
ties. I am a conservative Republican. 
He was a southern Democrat, having 
served as a State Representative and 
State Insurance Commissioner under a 
Democratic Governor. But that never 
impeded his willingness to encourage 
me or hear me out. Our debates and 
disagreements were always cordial. 
There was never a time when I did not 
glean something valuable from a con-
versation I had with him. He cared and 
believed in me, and that meant the 
world. 
Countless Tennesseeans would say 
the same about this mighty man. 
There was not a person in the town 
who Mr. Oakley did not endeavor to 
know. Whether you were the gas sta-
tion clerk, a sheriff’s deputy, or a stu-
dent, you mattered to Millard Vaughn 
Oakley. 
What I will always miss is his most 
sincere compassion. He gave life to the 
dreams of many. His generosity will 
live on through the numerous funds 
and scholarships to multiple schools 
and foundations. 
As you venture down Interstate 40 in 
Cookeville and exit to State Route 111, 
you will find yourself on Millard 
Vaughn Oakley Parkway. That is the 
main thoroughfare into the town so 
dearly loved by this treasure of a 
Tennesseean. Up that State Route, you 
will find an impressive public library 
giving children and adults access to 
thousands of books and a new magnifi-
cent county building, each made pos-
sible by the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. 
Oakley. 
There is no replacing Millard Vaughn 
Oakley, only honoring him by being 
better, doing better, and leaving this 
world a little better in memory of a 
great Tennesseean who did it better

f 
ENHANCING SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I am here this morning to 
talk about Social Security. I start with 
commending Chairman NEAL
of the 
Ways and Means Committee, and espe-
cially for his formation of the Racial 
Equity Committee that was headed up 
by one of the previous speakers, TERRI 
SEWELL, and STEVEN
HORSFORD, and 
JIMMY GOMEZ. 
Our great colleague, John Lewis, said 
that Social Security would be the next 
civil rights movement. John had prob-
ably no idea about what the pandemic 
would bring. What the pandemic has 
done has underscored the plight and 
the need of all of our fellow Americans. 
What I mean by that is this: This 
pandemic has hit the country hard. It 
is turning everybody’s lives upside 
down. There are close to a million peo-
ple in our country that have perished 
during 
this 
pandemic 
because 
of 
COVID–19; but 740,000 plus are over the 
age of 65. 
In that same group over the age of 65 
are, of course, the recipients of Social 
Security. Those recipients also are the 
people who are on a fixed income. Peo-
ple on a fixed income are hurt the 
hardest by the inflationary times that 
we are in. 
That is why we have proposed Social 
Security 2100: A Sacred Trust, that is 
currently in the process of being 
marked up in the Ways and Means 
Committee. It is being marked up so 
that we can address what Martin Lu-
ther King best described as the fierce 
urgency of now. 
What is that fierce urgency? For 
every Member of this body to go home 
and look at your brothers and sisters, 
their coworkers, the people you go to 
church and worship with, and under-
stand that it has been more than 50 
years since Congress enhanced any ben-
efit in Social Security. 
A gallon of milk was 71 cents back in 
1971. Look at the cost of milk. Look at 
the cost of gas. Look at the cost of 
heating and cooling your home. Look 
at the cost of groceries and prescrip-
tion drugs. 
And for Congress to be negligent and 
not address this issue—this is not 
something, Madam Speaker, that can 
be done through executive order, nor is 
the Supreme Court going to adjudicate. 
This is the direct responsibility of the 
United States Congress, and the last 
time it did something was in 1983. Ron-
ald Reagan was the President. Bob 
Dole was the Senate leader, and Tip 
O’Neill, the Speaker. They made the 
program more solvent then, but they 
did it by cutting benefits; the last of 
which just went into effect this Janu-
ary, with raising the age to 67. 
Now, it sounds good when you say, 
well, people are living longer so we 
have got to raise the age. But consider 
the logic: If you are living longer, how 
is it that you can sustain a cut in So-
cial Security? 
It hasn’t been enhanced in more than 
51 years. It is Congress’ responsibility. 
Ten thousand baby boomers a day be-
come eligible for Social Security. It af-
fects our rural communities more than 
it affects our urban communities. And 
in doing so, who has it impacted? Close 
to 5 million of our fellow Americans 
who get below-poverty-level checks 
from the Federal Government at a time 
we are passing out tax cuts to the 
wealthiest 1 percent in this country. 
If, indeed, Black lives matter and is 
more than just a slogan, we will be vot-
ing on this issue on this floor to send a 
message to the more than 65 million 
Social Security recipients that help is 
on the way. No one will ever work all 
their lives and then retire into poverty 
because we are going to create a new 
floor that will be 125 percent of what 
the poverty level is. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the body to 
take a look at Social Security 2100: A 
Sacred Trust. This is bipartisan. If you 
look at the data, 80 percent of Demo-
crats, 75 percent of Independents, 69 
percent of Republicans agree that these 
benefits need to be enhanced. It is a 
commonsense, practical way in this 
pandemic to both deal with inflation 
and give long-overdue relief to our sen-
ior citizens. 
Social Security is the number one 
anti-poverty program for the elderly. It 
is the number one anti-poverty pro-
gram for children. Our veterans utilize 
Social Security disability more than 
the VA. 
It is long overdue for this body to do 
one simple requirement that we all 
take an oath of office for, and that is 
to vote, and vote on increasing and en-
hancing Social Security and its bene-
fits, something that hasn’t been done 
in this body for more than 50 years.

PENNRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL WOM-
EN’S 
VARSITY 
SOCCER 
CHAM-
PIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the tremen-
dous 
accomplishment 
of 
the 
2020 
Pennridge High School women’s var-
sity soccer team. 
At a time when our schools were just 
reopening, the Pennridge women’s soc-
cer team seized the moment and went 
on to win their first PIAA Class 4A 
title on November 21, 2020. 
This victory was years in the mak-
ing, following a 2018 overtime loss in 
the final tournament game. Thanks to 
the visionary leadership of Coach Au-
drey Anderson, the Pennridge women’s 
varsity team pushed past the adversity 
and clinched the championship win. 
With both teams battling through a 
contentious 80 minutes of regulation 
and 27 minutes of overtime, freshman 
forward Tori Angelo chipped a pass 
over to junior Leah Malone to score 
the game-winner with just a few min-
utes remaining. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recog-
nize these champions today for their 
leadership and their outstanding ef-
forts in their 2020 season, and I for-
mally enter their names in the RECORD: 
Head Coach Audrey Anderson, Assist-
ant Coach Jason Lollar, Assistant 
Coach Erin Stevenson, captain Lindsey 
DeHaven, captain Leah Malone, cap-
tain Maddie Angelo, captain Emily 
Kriney, Sierra Shaeffer, Cady McKean, 
Anna Croyle, Zoe Sabol, Liv Grenda, 
Riley Hepler, Tori Angelo, Kera Dam, 
Casey Malone, Brielle Tasher, Jess 
Levush, 
Joey 
Tomlinson, 
Lauren 
Atchley, 
Lavi 
Baldovin, 
Lindsey 
Balmer, Raina Adelman, Sophie Craig, 
Aubrey Long, Avery Drumbore, Danae 
Luecke, Lauren Moylan, Maggie Hayes, 
Ryan Hodder, Sammi McBride, Sam 
Kiwak, and Phia Lowery. 
Madam Speaker, along with that vic-
tory, it is with a heavy heart that I 
recognize the team’s assistant coach 
who recently passed away, Robert Lee 
Miller. 
Anyone who had the privilege of 
knowing Robert knows that he could 
always be found on the soccer field, 
lending his strengths and gifts to coach 
dozens of teams and mentor thousands 
of youth players. 
As our Bucks County community 
mourns his loss and remembers his pas-
sion for the game, I would like to offer 
a moment of silence for Robert Miller. 
Madam Speaker, we are incredibly 
grateful for the inspiration and im-
pacts that the coaches of the entire 
Pennridge women’s soccer team and, of 
course, the team’s parents have had on 
our community. They are a tremen-
dous asset. 
We are very proud of all of them, and 
I look forward to seeing them all and 
presenting them with flags individually 
that were flown over the U.S. House of 
Representatives.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker,

you are wearing today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate the Powell Panthers football

sociation State championship in 2021.

April 27, 2022 
by a final score of 42–34 at Chat-
tanooga’s Finley Stadium to win the 
Class 5A BlueCross Bowl championship. 
That is the equivalent to our State 
championship, if anybody is wondering. 
This victory was significant for all 
the players and coaches, including the 
Panthers’ head coach, Matt Lowe. 
Back in 2011, Coach Lowe was a fresh-
man player on the Powell football 
team when the Panthers lost in a 
heartbreaker State championship game 
to Henry County High School. 
A decade later, he led his alma mater 
to a championship that brought pride 
to every student at Powell High School 
and the community. 
It was not an easy win for the Pan-
thers. The Patriots were competitive 
throughout all four quarters, but the 
Panthers claimed the title when the 
final whistle sounded. 
Winning this championship was the 
Panthers’ goal all season long, and 
nothing was going to stand in their 
way. The team kept its eye on the prize 
and gave it their all to capture its first 
State championship in the end. 
The Powell Panthers worked hard 
and supported each other the entire 
season, and it paid off with a State 
title. 
Congratulations to all the players, 
Head Coach Matt Lowe, the team sup-
port staff, and the entire Powell High 
School community on this great vic-
tory. 
CELEBRATING THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF 
ALBERT HARB 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to sing the praises of a man 
who I feel is probably the greatest legal 
mind in America. It is my good friend 
Albert Harb. He has been an attorney 
in East Tennessee since the 1980s, and 
Albert will retire from practicing law 
this spring. I rise to celebrate his dis-
tinguished career. 
Albert earned both his undergraduate 
and law degrees from the University of 
Tennessee. After working with fellow 
attorney Joe Yancey for several years, 
Albert went to work for the firm 
Hodges, Doughty & Carson in 1984. He 
has been employed by the firm ever 
since. 
Throughout the years, East Ten-
nessee has sought out Albert’s legal ex-
pertise in commercial litigation, con-
struction law, product liability, per-
sonal injury, domestic litigation, and 
occasional divorce cases. He also pro-
vides legal services for business trans-
actions, corporate law, and wrongful 
death suits. 
Organizations such as the Best Law-
yers in America, Best Lawyers Con-
sumer Guide, Who’s Who American 
Law, and Mid-South Super Lawyers 
have all recognized Albert for his ex-
cellent representation in the fields of 
commercial litigation and personal in-
jury. 
In the Knoxville News Sentinel, a 
noted politician was quoted as saying 
that he was the best legal mind in 
America. Additionally, he is consist-
ently recognized by Cityview Magazine 
as one of Knoxville’s top lawyers for 
personal injury and construction law. 
Outside of practicing law, Albert is 
engaged with the Knoxville commu-
nity. When West High School’s mock 
trial team won the Tennessee State 
championship, Albert mentored the 
students by serving as their attorney 
coach. 
He also held leadership positions 
with WDVX, the Peninsula Club, and 
the Ramallah Club of Knoxville. 
Albert and his wonderful wife, Car-
men, are parents to Ashley, Nicholas, 
and Noel, and they have several grand-
children. 
Albert, thank you for your dedicated 
legal 
representation 
to 
East 
Ten-
nesseans. I wish you the best in your 
retirement, and congratulations on 
achieving of counsel status. 
RECOGNIZING LUCY AND RAY HAND AS 
KNOXVILLIANS OF THE YEAR 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate Lucy and Ray 
Hand, two of my all-time favorite peo-
ple and two incredibly amazing people 
who helped me through one of the 
toughest periods of my life. 
They were recently recognized by the 
Junior Achievement of East Tennessee 
as Knoxvillians of the Year. 
When I was going through a particu-
larly tough time in my life, I had a lot 
of bad press. On a Tuesday, I always re-
call, I received a call from Lucy Hand. 
She said: Kickoff for the UT game is 
this Saturday at noon. I expect to see 
you in the skybox with us. 
I asked if she had seen what the 
paper was saying about me, and she 
said: TIMMY, kickoff is at noon. Don’t 
make me send Raymond after you. 
You know it is serious business, 
Madam Speaker, when Lucy brings up 
Ray. 
So, I went to the game, and the 
Hands, of course, were gracious hosts 
to me as they always are. At halftime, 
I decided to go down to the lower sec-
tion of Neyland Stadium and check out 
some renovations that were recently 
completed 
and 
to 
see 
General 
Neyland’s statue. 
When I got there, I heard the most 
beautiful noise in the world. It was the 
sweetest little 4-year-old girl I think I 
had ever seen. She was wearing some 
unbelievably cool little red shoes. They 
were sparkling, and she was spinning 
around. I can see it in my mind’s eye 
right now. 
After I saw her, I looked to my left, 
and it was the most beautiful woman 
that I had ever seen. Her name was 
Kelly, and she would later become my 
wife, and Isabel would soon become my 
daughter. 
That day changed my life. Lucy and 
Ray Hand were there for that moment, 
just like they were there when my par-
ents died, when I married Kelly, and 
when I adopted my Isabel. They were 
also here in Washington in 2019 when I 
was sworn into Congress. 
I remember when they were standing 
in line, and the Capitol policeman 
asked me if they were my family be-
cause 
they 
were 
escorting 
family 
through. I looked at him and said, yes, 
they are my family. Madam Speaker, 
they are my family. 
I thank them for being my friends, 
and I thank them for bringing Kelly 
and Isabel and me together and cre-
ating a wonderful family for me. 
I congratulate them on winning 
Knoxvillians of the Year.

RECOGNIZING SEAN HANNITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we appreciate your 
million-dollar smile. 
Living legend Sean Hannity of FOX 
News is now officially the longest run-
ning prime-time cable news host in tel-
evision history, passing the former 
record of Larry King. 
I especially appreciate his profes-
sionalism, having myself minored in 
journalism and being editor of my high 
school, college, and law school news-
papers, and also being an intern re-
porter for The Post and Courier, the 
daily paper of Charleston, South Caro-
lina. 
He is a champion for freedom, and he 
cites each day that has passed in honor 
of the 13 dead Americans in Kabul. He 
also points out, sadly, the Americans 
left behind in Afghanistan. 
He stands with the heroes of Ukraine 
fighting war criminal Putin as Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskyy inspires: 
Live free or die. 
As aptly written in an April 21 FOX 
News story by Brian Flood: ‘‘Hannity, 
who has been with the network since it 
was launched in 1996, has hosted a 
prime-time program on FOX News for 
25 consecutive years, 6 months, and 15 
days. 
‘‘ ‘Sean’s authenticity and insightful 
commentary have created one of the 
most enduring connections with our 
audience, and it has been an honor to 
watch him over the years. A FOX News 
original, he has helped innovate the in-
dustry, and we are incredibly proud of 
his extraordinary success,’ FOX News 
Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a 
statement. 
‘‘Hannity’s eponymous program has 
been one of the most-watched cable 
news programs on a regular basis. 
‘Hannity’ has finished number one in 
its time slot for 13 consecutive years 
among both total viewers and the ad-
vertiser-coveted demographic of adults 
age 25 to 54 since launching as a solo 
hour in January 2009, according to 
Nielsen Media Research. 
‘‘ ‘I am extremely grateful to FOX 
News Media and to our loyal, dedicated 
viewers, whom I am proud to serve 
every night,’ Hannity said. 
‘‘Before landing a solo program, 
Hannity was one half of the popular 
‘Hannity & Colmes’ with the late Alan 
Colmes. 
‘‘Last year, Hannity joined ‘FOX & 
Friends’ to discuss the network’s 25th

anniversary. ‘It was a bold innovation. 
Everybody laughed. Nobody thought it 
would be successful. Not only did we 
quickly become number one, but we 
have been able to maintain that num-
ber one position for a very long period 
of time,’ Sean Hannity said. 
‘‘FOX News finished the first quarter 
of 2022 as basic cable’s most-watched 
network, crushing CNN and MSNBC for 
the 81st straight quarter during a busy 
news cycle that included Russia’s’’ hid-
eous ‘‘invasion of Ukraine,’’ sadly, ‘‘the 
ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and 
round-the-clock political news.’’ 
‘‘Over the last 25 years, Hannity has 
interviewed 
newsmakers, 
including 
former President Trump, former Vice 
President Mike Pence, former Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . . . and 
most recently, award-winning actor 
and director Sean Penn. Hannity is 
also the author of four New York 
Times bestselling books.’’ 
Congratulations, Sean. Thank you 
for providing America with news we 
can trust by telling the truth. 
I have another personal interest. Our 
family really appreciates newscasters. 
My oldest son, Alan, the attorney gen-
eral of South Carolina, married the 
leading newscaster of South Carolina, 
Jennifer Miskewicz, of WIS-TV. Be-
cause he married over his head, he was 
elected the youngest attorney general 
of the United States. 
As I conclude, as the co-chair of the 
French Caucus, I congratulate Presi-
dent Emmanuel Macron on his reelec-
tion. America appreciates our first ally 
with extraordinary representation by 
Ambassador Philippe Etienne. 
We stand together for the people of 
Ukraine and with President Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy.

SKYROCKETING PRESCRIPTION 
DRUG PRICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, this week, I hosted a 
seniors’ townhall in my district in 
which many had concerns about their 
access to long-term care, the price of 
prescription drugs, and their Social Se-
curity benefits. 
Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65 
years old. That is 65 years of raising 
families, paying their taxes, protecting 
our country, and building our commu-
nities. 
After six decades of working hard for 
this country, they have the right to the 
benefits 
and 
resources 
they 
have 
earned for retirement. We do not need 
to cut benefits but, instead, expand ac-
cess to the full range of long-term care 
services that help seniors within their 
communities. 
Unfortunately, it has become far too 
expensive for middle-class friends and 
families to care for our seniors. Pre-
scription drug prices are a major com-
ponent of the overall cost of caring for 
the elderly. 
While Medicare part D pays for some 
medications for those enrolled in the 
plan, it is reported that over 65 percent 
of our seniors’ prescription drug costs 
are out of pocket. No American should 
ever have to break the bank to pay for 
lifesaving care. 
b 1045 
But today, too many Americans are 
forced to make the decision between 
paying their bills or buying their pills. 
Democrats have been fighting to 
bring down healthcare costs and lower 
prescription drug prices by holding in-
surance companies and drug companies 
accountable while strengthening Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
In his State of the Union Address, 
President Biden announced an initia-
tive to improve quality long-term care 
for our Nation’s beloved seniors and 
people with disabilities. 
The announcement uplifts what I 
have long championed: every person in 
the United States deserves to age with 
dignity, respect, and access to quality 
healthcare. 
These actions will be part of a long- 
overdue comprehensive reform to pro-
tect the welfare, safety, and rights of 
seniors and people with disabilities liv-
ing in nursing homes. 
Our country and our economy are 
stronger and healthier when every 
American has access to quality, afford-
able healthcare, and long-term care. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to make sure these issues 
are addressed and that we support and 
look out for our Nation’s seniors.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, again we lift up our 
prayers to You on behalf of the people 
of Ukraine. After one of the holiest 
weeks in the Orthodox Church, though 
they were once companions in belief, 
with whom sweet fellowship was pos-
sible in the House of God, the wicked 
have sown confusion. The evil continue 
to spread threats and lies. 
We appeal to You to speak into both 
sides of the conflict. Judge the be-
trayal of brothers in faith and en-
lighten them to Your truth. Allow 
those who have remained faithful to 
Your will, who live according to the 
loving example You have shown us, 
who adhere to Your word, to have their 
voices heard above the fray of false-
hood and propaganda. 
In Your infinite mercy, answer the 
voices who cry out to You in distress. 
Bring redemption to the innocent from 
the horror besieging them. Give refuge 
to those who ardently defend their cit-
ies from the unthinkable violence and 
strife. 
Holy 
God, 
comfort 
those 
whose 
hearts are anguished. Calm those who 
are beset with fear and trembling. For 
in You, our Lord, is our only hope. We 
pray to You for Ukraine’s deliverance. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to sound the 
alarm on an urgent situation that re-
quires the Federal Government to de-
ploy an emergency response. 
A retired U.S. Navy vessel at the Buf-
falo and Erie County Naval and Mili-
tary Park is sinking. Without help, the 
USS The Sullivans, which was part of an 
elite class of World War II destroyers 
and is a national historic landmark, 
will be lost forever. 
The visual of a partially submerged 
ship in Buffalo’s harbor provides a 
vivid warning that irreplaceable mili-
tary history is in jeopardy if we don’t 
act. 
This isn’t the only vessel in need of 
support. Maritime heritage grants, na-
tional preservation programs, and the 
Department of Defense are potential

HERO ZELENSKYY 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, Ukraine President Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy has shown the world he is a 
leader to be respected and admired. He 
has earned being a hero to the people of 
Ukraine, to win for freedom. 
Prior to his election in 2019, Mr. 
Zelenskyy was a former actor and co-
median. Some questioned these creden-
tials, but President Zelenskyy is the 
right leader at the right time for the 
world. 
The cowardly Putin invasion has left 
untold thousands of Ukrainian civil-
ians murdered. Yet, instead of retreat-
ing, Zelenskyy has stood up to Putin as 
a compassionate man of the people. 
Just yesterday, he went to another 
Kyiv hospital visiting with a pair of or-
phaned children who lost their parents 
to Putin bombs. 
‘‘In the first days of the war, every-
body was in shock, and everybody was 
thinking what to do. . . .’’ ‘‘The Presi-
dent’s decision was that no one goes 
anywhere. We stay in Kyiv, and we 
fight. That cemented it,’’ explained an 
adviser. 
Terrorists, sadly, are emboldened 
worldwide with three rocket attacks in 
the last week from Gaza into Israel, as 
America stands with Ambassador Mi-
chael Herzog. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. 
God bless Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late John Martincic, president of For-
est Scientific Corporation, for being 
named the 2022 Pennsylvania Small 
Business Association Small Business-
person of the Year, and the 2022 West-
ern Pennsylvania SBA District Small 
Businessperson of the Year. 
For more than 30 years, John has 
been involved with the design, repair, 
and manufacturing of computer numer-
ical control machines. 
John has always been an entre-
preneur and, as the founder and presi-
dent of Forest Scientific Corporation, 
his work in the CNC space has sup-
ported businesses of all sizes. His ma-
chines are used for a multitude of ap-
plications, ranging from sign making 
to aerospace. 
In addition, John spends time pro-
moting the education and training sur-
rounding CNC and entrepreneurship at

WELCOMING TREVOR REED HOME 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a momentous day, as we have just re-
ceived the news that my constituent, 
Trevor Reed, a Texan, a marine, and a 
patriot, has been released from a Rus-
sian prison after being held for an an-
guishing 985 days as a political pawn. 
Trevor’s parents, Paula and Joey 
Reed of Granbury, Texas, have been 
tireless advocates for the release of 
their son, and I cannot imagine the re-
lief that they are feeling right now. 
The Reeds have been living a 21⁄2-year 
nightmare, fighting every day for their 
son’s release. And today, our prayers 
have been answered. 
I thank my colleagues in Congress on 
both sides of the aisle for working in a 
bipartisan manner to pass the resolu-
tion calling for Trevor’s release, and 
continuing to draw attention to his 
case, including my predecessor, Mike 
Conaway, 
Chairman 
MIKE
MCCAUL, 
Senator CORNYN, Leader MCCARTHY, 
Congresswoman JACKSON LEE, and Con-
gressman CASTRO, and my entire office 
that represents the 11th District, my 
staff. 
I especially recognize Ambassador 
Sullivan and his team, as well as those 
that work in the NSA, the NSC, and 
the SPEHA. 
Finally, President Biden, thank you 
for bringing Trevor Reed home. Thank 
you for believing in leaving no Amer-
ican overseas.

AIDING UKRAINE’S FIGHT FOR 
FREEDOM 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I just 
returned from a trip to Ukraine with 
my colleague, Representative SPARTZ, 
last night. We were invited by Ukrain-
ian officials to see firsthand their im-
mediate needs. 
The destruction and loss of life was 
heartbreaking. Everywhere we went, 
we saw the evidence of Putin’s war 
crimes. One stop we made was at a resi-
dential building in Odesa that had been 
hit by Russian missiles the day before. 
A grandmother, her daughter, and her 
daughter’s baby were killed in that 
same apartment. They were among 18 
other innocent victims killed in the at-
tacks. 
Yet, in the face of such evil actions, 
the Ukrainian spirit remains strong. 
To aid their fight for freedom, more 
must be done by both the United 
States and the international commu-
nity. 
Advanced 
weaponry, 
humani-
tarian supplies, and much more can 
and should be ramped up. 
The Ukrainians are brave people, and 
they will win the war against Russia’s 
invasion if they have the tools and the 
resources to do so in hand. 
God bless Ukraine.

IMMIGRATION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the sit-
uation with our border, it couldn’t be a 
whole lot worse. Here are the numbers 
for February and March; border cross-
ings were 220,000. The numbers keep 
going up. 
So at a time here where a recent de-
cision by a judge enabled us to not 
have to wear masks to get on airplanes 
or other public transportation because 
America’s health is improving, the 
President wants to get rid of the title 
42 provision put in place by President 
Trump to help keep America safe from 
those that have health issues or disease 
issues from coming across our border 
exacerbating already this giant prob-
lem we have. 
If title 42 is allowed to expire, then 
this will open the floodgates even 
wider. So I appreciate the decision to 
at least uphold title 42 while our Fed-
eral Government fights that decision 
and resources are used by legal folks, 
Department of Justice, whatever, to 
make it where title 42 is waived. 
I want to ask what side is the Presi-
dent and his administration on, if not 
for the American people’s health?

PUT MORE MONEY IN AMERICANS’ 
POCKETS 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, in the last 15 months, President 
Biden 
and 
House 
Democrats 
have 
dumped trillions of dollars on the 
struggling economy already weighed 
down by left-wing overspending. 
We warned them that if they contin-
ued to print money to fund their reck-
less liberal wish list, inflation would 
hammer the American people. Now, in-
flation will cost the average American 
family an extra $5,000 this year. Folks 
are traveling less; they are buying less 
because of Joe Biden. Inflation is 
crushing the working-class people. 
Last week, I introduced the House-
hold Income Tax Suspension Act to 
provide the equivalent of a 6-month 
Federal income tax holiday for mil-
lions of hardworking Americans. 
Americans want relief. Let’s allow 
them to keep more of their own money 
instead of weighing down the economy 
with ineffective stimulus. This is com-
mon sense. We need to put more money 
back into the working people’s pock-
ets.

UNCONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES 
SACRIFICE FREEDOM 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States was born out of disobe-
dience. It was disobedience to a tyran-
nical government that led to the found-
ing of our Constitution and our Amer-
ican ideals. Today, patriots still some-
times disobey, even at the cost of great 
personal hardship. 
Twenty-year veterans of law enforce-
ment agencies have turned in their 
badges because they refuse to bow the 
knee to vaccine mandates. 
Nurses have worked and studied for 
years, only to have their jobs stripped 
away because of a virus that they 
themselves committed to defeating. 
Servicemembers, firefighters, EMTs, 
are all sacrificing their careers to 
stand for their convictions and for free-
dom. 
Unconstitutional mandates sacrifice 
freedom on the altar of safety. Mask 
mandates are dying because patriots 
have fought back. Let’s do it again 
with vaccine mandates. This is not a 
matter of health; it is a matter of lib-
erty. 
These heroes will not go away quiet-
ly, and we will defend them because 
they have defended us. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to end med-
ical tyranny, end Federal Government 
overreach, and end vaccine mandates.

PATENTS FOR HUMANITY ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I move

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 5796. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
b 1215 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5796, a bipartisan bill which codifies a 
competition at the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office called Patents for 
Humanity. 
The Patents for Humanity program 
highlights the ways that innovation 
and intellectual property help solve 
global humanitarian challenges. 
I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan 
legislation, alongside Representative 
SPARTZ, to ensure that special recogni-
tion permanently extends to inventors 
who turn their genius toward helping 
the world’s most needy and vulnerable. 
The Founders of our country under-
stood that society would benefit if we 
incentivized creativity and innovation. 
That is why Article I, Section 8, Clause 
8 of the United States Constitution 
gives Congress the power to create a 
robust intellectual property system to 
promote the progress of science and 
useful arts. 
As Members of Congress, we have 
often worked together in a bipartisan 
fashion to carry out this constitutional 
mandate, as we are doing today. 
The Patents for Humanity Act sim-
ply codifies an already existing annual 
competition run by the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office that incentivizes 
the use of patented technologies for hu-
manitarian purposes. It is run without 
cost to the taxpayer, as USPTO is a 
fee-based entity. 
The award for the Patents for Hu-
manity competition is a certificate to 
accelerate 
select 
matters 
before 
USPTO and public recognition during a 
ceremony held by that Office. 
Winners are selected by a panel of 
judges who look for inventions that ad-
dress either humanitarian needs among 
an impoverished population or that 
further research by others with respect 
to humanitarian technologies. Applica-
tions are considered in categories in-
cluding: medicine, nutrition, sanita-
tion, household energy, and living 
standards. The 2022 competition also 
included a category for COVID–19-re-
lated inventions. 
Since its implementation as a pilot 
program 10 years ago, winners have in-
cluded 
not-for-profit 
organizations, 
startups, universities, corporations, as 
well as individual inventors through-
out the country. Winning submissions 
have included an all-terrain wheel-
chair; improvements to water purifi-
cation systems and clean water stor-
age; rechargeable lanterns for those

without 
access 
to 
reliable 
energy 
sources; a portable, low-water kidney 
dialysis machine; and an affordable and 
highly adjustable prosthetic limb sys-
tem. These and many other innova-
tions have improved the quality of life 
of millions of individuals. 
By codifying H.R. 5796, we strengthen 
and recognize the importance of this 
program while providing the USPTO 
the flexibility to continue to improve 
its implementation. 
In December, this bill passed the 
House Committee on the Judiciary 
unanimously, building upon the work 
of Representative MCBATH, who suc-
cessfully led a bipartisan effort to pass 
the Patents for Humanity Program Im-
provement Act into law last Congress, 
which allows award certificates to be 
transferable. 
Today, we go a step further by ensur-
ing this program is a permanent fea-
ture of our innovation system and 
economy. 
Once again, I thank Representative 
VICTORIA SPARTZ for her partnership on 
this legislation, as well as her leader-
ship as it relates to the terrible situa-
tion in Ukraine. I also thank my col-
league, Representative ISSA, for his 
leadership as well. 
The Patents for Humanity program 
shows how American innovation and 
creativity can continue to change the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5796, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I join with my col-
leagues in what I believe will be unani-
mous support for the continued pro-
motion of works useful to humanity. 
This pilot program, after 10 years, has 
proven to be not only a good one but 
one that continues to be necessary. 
In 1790, when President Washington 
evaluated and signed the first patent, 
he did so in a matter of a few weeks 
from submission. It was an expectation 
that a timely patent was, in fact, crit-
ical. That first patent improved the 
production of potash, often used in fer-
tilizer. 
The fact is, over the years, our abil-
ity to quickly evaluate patents has, in 
fact, not continued to keep pace. So, 
when you have something like these 
humanitarian offerings, the fact that 
we are able to, at least in these cases 
and for known inventors, reward them 
with an accelerated consideration as 
part of their continued work, I think 
that is the kind of an award that 
means a great deal when it is the ad-
vancement of items of humanitarian 
interest and need. 
My colleague from New York did a 
wonderful job of talking about some of 
those inventions. We could go on for 
hours about what inventive genius has 
come from this and other incentives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this renewal and, lastly, to 
recognize that the one area that Amer-
ica leads in is innovation. This body 
has a continued obligation to do every-
thing it can to promote that innova-
tion, including the modernization and 
the improvement of the Patent and 
Trademark Office. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia for his continued leadership in 
this area. 
Once again, Congress is coming to-
gether in a bipartisan way to uplift 
American innovation and innovators, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port this important piece of legisla-
tion. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5796, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

COURTHOUSE ETHICS AND 
TRANSPARENCY ACT

April 27, 2022 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 3059. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3059, the Courthouse 
Ethics and Transparency Act of 2021, 
embodies an important bipartisan ef-
fort to address an alarming lack of 
transparency in the personal financial 
holdings of Article III Federal judges 
and the conflicts, or appearance of con-
flicts, those holdings can create in the 
cases these judges are asked to preside 
over and decide. 
This legislation makes incremental 
but necessary progress toward account-
ability by building on Federal statutes 
that already prohibit judges from de-
ciding cases in which they have a per-
sonal financial stake in the outcome. 
It has been the law in this country 
since the 1970s that judges must recuse 
themselves from any case in which 
they hold a legal or equitable interest 
of any size in any party or property 
under consideration. 
To help ensure that recusals occur as 
required, Federal law often mandates 
that judges file annual reports dis-
closing their personal financial inter-
ests so that the litigants, press, and 
the general public can monitor and 
check these responsibilities. 
Unfortunately, recent reporting by a 
Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 
investigative 
reporter and a hearing by the Judiciary 
Committee’s Subcommittee on Courts, 
Intellectual Property, and the Internet 
have shown that the law is not working 
as intended. The infrequency of judges’ 
financial disclosures and the inacces-
sibility of the reports have made actual 
transparency practically impossible. 
When the House first passed this 
version of the legislation last year, an 
investigation revealed that, between 
2010 and 2018, over 130 Federal judges 
had decided cases in which they are 
part owners of the parties before them. 
Over 60 judges have actively traded 
shares in entities involved in their 
courthouse deliberations while their 
cases were still ongoing and, in some 
cases, profited from these trades. 
At the time, this investigation also 
discovered 
approximately 
685 
cases 
where judges should have, according to 
the law, recused themselves. That 
number has continued to climb and 
now stands north of a thousand cases. 
So far, judges in 836 cases have notified 
the parties that the case can be re-
opened because the judge unlawfully 
failed to recuse. 
While these numbers are incredibly 
alarming on their own, they may sim-
ply be the tip of the iceberg. I am sorry 
to say that we can expect these num-
bers may continue to grow as more 
data becomes available and investiga-
tions continue. 
The consequences of these actions 
are both acute and widespread. Failure 
to recuse can cause real harm to par-
ties seeking fair and impartial justice 
and leave a cloud of doubt over any de-
cision that is made once the conflicts 
are subsequently uncovered. 
S. 3059 addresses these problems by 
requiring Federal judges to abide by 
the same periodic transaction report-
ing laws already applicable to Members 
of 
Congress 
and 
senior 
executive 
branch officials. 
The bill also requires the Adminis-
trative Office of the U.S. Courts to cre-
ate an online database of judicial fi-
nancial disclosure reports and to time-
ly update that database with search-
able, sortable, and downloadable copies 
of disclosure reports as they become 
available so that litigants, the press, 
and the public can analyze and access 
this information in real time. 
The two versions of this legislation, 
including the original version passed 
by the House and the bill currently be-
fore us, S. 3059, make two notable 
changes. 
First, it makes it crystal clear that 
these reforms also cover bankruptcy 
and magistrate court judges. This is a 
welcome change. 
Second, 
in 
response 
to 
concerns 
raised by the courts, it allows the Di-
rector of the Administrative Office of 
the Courts to take more than 180 days 
to develop the public website and data-
base containing judicial financial dis-
closure reports so long as the Director 
provides the Congress with a date cer-
tain when the website will launch. We 
expect that the Administrative Office 
of the Courts will request no more time 
than a few more months and will not 
use this authority to delay disclosure. 
These simple solutions are long over-
due and the product of bicameral and 
bipartisan collaboration. 
I thank Congresswoman ROSS for her 
leadership in this area and Congress-
man ISSA for championing this legisla-
tion. I also thank my friend from Geor-
gia (Mr. JOHNSON), chairman of the 
Subcommittee on the Courts, Intellec-
tual Property, and the Internet, as well 
as Senator CORNYN and the other Sen-
ators who worked on this bipartisan 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. I join 
with the chairman in support of all of 
the changes that were added in the 
Senate, they were thoughtful, and I be-
lieve not just appropriate but nec-
essary. 
I don’t want to pile on the same 
statements made already because they 
were accurate and I agree with them. 
Rather, because there has been fairly 
public pushback from some members of 
the Article III court that we are med-
dling in their business, I have given it 
a lot of thought and discussed it with a 
number of scholars. 
I think the American people need to 
understand that the executive branch 
does not have the authority to pass 
laws, and the judicial branch does not 
have the ability to pass laws. When it 
comes to establishing laws for trans-
parency reporting and the American 
people’s right to know, there is, in fact, 
only one body that can initiate and 
send for the President’s signature stat-
utes of transparency and account-
ability. 
So even though this is a 1978 law 
being modified, the fact that there is 
pushback from a branch saying that 
under separation of powers we are 
somehow meddling by substantially 
harmonizing what the executive branch 
and this branch do to make sure the 
American people have confidence in 
what we own that might, in fact, be in-
fluencing what we do. It seems to be 
one of those areas in which I believe 
the American people, properly ex-
plained, would fully support. 
For that reason, I would hope that as 
this bill becomes law that the members 
of the court would recognize we had no 
choice. Faced with clear examples— 
even one being too much—of a judge 
who had holdings and simultaneously 
affected the value of those holdings 
while either owning them or trading 
them or both, we had no choice but to 
recognize that that absence of trans-
parency was critical. 
I want to simply close by saying that 
this is likely not to lead to a lot more 
recusals. This is certainly going to lead 
to the kind of information that attor-
neys need to have on behalf of their cli-
ents when they are working through a 
case. 
If you know that a judge or his 
spouse or her spouse owns something, 
why wouldn’t you be aware of that 
when you have a case involving that 
company? If you know that they own a 
substantial amount of a sister com-
pany, one that is not involved in the 
litigation, but in fact, could benefit by 
an adverse decision, the attorneys for 
both sides should know that. 
We are just not dealing in the failure 
to 
recuse 
here. 
Reporting 
trans-
parency, in fact, empowers both sides 
to know the lay of the land that might 
be very meaningful in a case. Yes, 
there will be some that see that and 
ask for recusals. I trust that judges 
who, after the fact when these 130 cases 
were reported, some of the judges said 
they didn’t know about it, they didn’t 
know they had it, or they didn’t know 
their spouse had these holdings. That 
may very well be true. Some of them 
said they didn’t know they were sup-
posed to report. That may be true. 
But when this is implemented we will 
be in a position to say, of course the 
public knew, and empowering the pub-
lic on this not private information be-
cause ultimately we are public offi-
cials. I am a public official, the chair-
man is a public official, the Speaker is 
a public official, and so are those hon-
ored to serve as magistrates, bank-
ruptcy judges, and Article III judges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4523 
April 27, 2022 
I hope that this minor change will 
represent a major step for us in bring-
ing back the confidence of the Amer-
ican people that they do not have to 
blindly go into a case not knowing 
whether the heavy hand of the law 
might be weighing against them with-
out their knowledge. 
Mr. Speaker, it seems like only yes-
terday I was speaking on this subject. 
This is an important step. I know 
that we will have broad bipartisan sup-
port on it. I hope that we will have not 
just acceptance but an embracement 
by the judges who now will be report-
ing and providing more information to 
the public that the public has—and 
particularly 
litigants—have 
every 
right to know before they go before 
that judge. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for his 
help in shepherding this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Framers, in their 
infinite wisdom, created a system of 
government with three separate and 
coequal branches: Article I, legislative 
branch; Article II, executive branch; 
and Article III, judicial branch, three 
separate but coequal branches of gov-
ernment. 
Justice Brandeis once said: In a de-
mocracy, sunlight is the best of dis-
infectants. There are standards of 
transparency and disclosure that al-
ready exist as relates to the Article I 
legislative branch and senior officials 
within the Article II executive branch. 
Those same standards of transparency 
and disclosure allowing for account-
ability should exist across the three 
branches of government. This legisla-
tion takes a meaningful step in that di-
rection. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
ROSS for her leadership. I thank Con-
gressman ISSA
for his leadership. I 
thank Chairman JOHNSON, as well as 
Senator CORNYN, and those who have 
worked on this important legislation in 
a bipartisan, bicameral way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3059. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CALLING 
ON 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OR TO 
RELEASE UNITED STATES CIT-
IZEN PAUL WHELAN 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 336) calling on the 
Government of the Russian Federation 
to provide evidence or to release 
United States citizen Paul Whelan, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 336 
Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan 
is a resident of Novi, Michigan, and a United 
States Marine Corps veteran; 
Whereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow 
for the wedding of a personal friend on De-
cember 22, 2018; 
Whereas Russia’s Federal Security Service 
arrested Paul Whelan at the Metropol Hotel 
in Moscow on December 28, 2018, and charged 
him with espionage; 
Whereas the Federal Security Service has 
never provided any evidence of supposed 
wrongdoing; 
Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in 
Lefortovo Prison and was held there for 
more than 19 months after his arrest in pre-
trial detention; 
Whereas a Moscow court extended Paul 
Whelan’s pretrial detention multiple times 
without publicly presenting justification or 
evidence of wrongdoing; 
Whereas even Paul Whelan’s Federal Secu-
rity 
Service-appointed 
lawyer, 
Vladimir 
Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019, ‘‘[The 
Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out 
what they have, but in this case, we’ve seen 
nothing concrete against Whelan in five 
months. That means there is nothing.’’; 
Whereas the then United States Ambas-
sador to the Russian Federation, Jon Hunts-
man, responded on April 12, 2019, to a ques-
tion about the detention of Paul Whelan, ‘‘If 
the Russians have evidence, they should 
bring it forward. We have seen nothing. If 
there was a case, I think the evidence would 
have been brought forward by now.’’; 
Whereas then Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo met with Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and urged 
him to ensure United States citizens are not 
unjustly held abroad; 
Whereas the Kremlin has refused Paul 
Whelan full access to his lawyer and the so- 
called evidence against him; 
Whereas any evidence he has seen is in 
Russian, a language Paul does not read or 
speak; 
Whereas Lefortovo pretrial detention facil-
ity and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-
fused to provide medical treatment for Paul 
Whelan’s medical condition, despite being 
aware of its worsening state, resulting in 
emergency surgery on May 29, 2020; 
Whereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully con-
victed on June 15, 2020, and sentenced to 16 
years in a Russian labor camp by a 3-judge 
panel, in a trial witnessed by then United 
States Ambassador John Sullivan, who re-
ferred to it as ‘‘a mockery of justice’’ due to 
the denial of a fair trial and the exclusion of 
defense witnesses; 
Whereas in August 2020, on an unknown 
day because he was moved secretly, Paul 
Whelan was transferred to camp IK–17, a 
penal labor camp in Mordovia, where he is 
forced to work 6 days a week in a garment 
factory; 
Whereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while 
visiting Paul Whelan at the labor camp in 
Mordovia, stated that ‘‘Russian authorities 
. . . have never shown the world evidence of 
his guilt,’’ and reiterated his call that the 
Russian authorities correct this injustice 
and release Mr. Whelan; and 
Whereas 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony 
Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Min-
ister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021, and 
urged him to release Americans detained in 
Russia, including Paul Whelan and Trevor 
Reed, so that they are able to return home to 
their families in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) demands the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation present credible evidence on 
the allegations against Paul Whelan or im-
mediately release him from imprisonment; 
(2) demands the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation comply with its inter-
national treaty obligations and provide unre-
stricted consular access to Paul Whelan 
while he remains imprisoned in Russia; 
(3) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide Paul Whelan, Trevor 
Reed, and all others imprisoned for political 
motivations or otherwise unjustly impris-
oned their constitutionally afforded due 
process rights and universally recognized 
human rights; and 
(4) expresses sympathy to the family of 
Paul Whelan for this travesty to justice and 
personal hardship, and expresses hope that 
their ordeal can soon be brought to a just 
end. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
336, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H. Res. 336, calling on the 
Government of the Russian Federation 
to provide evidence or to release 
United States citizen Paul Whelan. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
STEVENS for her tireless work on behalf 
of her constituent, Paul Whelan, whom 
Russia has held hostage as a political 
prisoner for over 3 years. 
For more than 1,300 days the Russian 
Government has put Paul and his fam-
ily 
through 
unimaginable 
torment: 
taking away Paul’s freedom, threat-
ening his health, and denying him his 
most basic human rights—all for the 
purpose of using an American citizen— 
a human being—as a political bar-
gaining chip. 
Paul’s treatment at the hands of the 
Russian Government and its so-called 
justice system is shocking, but unfor-
tunately, hardly surprising. 
As we witness the horrors committed 
by Putin, his enablers, and Russian 
forces in Ukraine, we are reminded of 
the lengths that the authoritarian re-
gime in the Kremlin will go to achieve 
its nefarious objectives. But neither 
Paul nor any political prisoner is a tool 
to be used for an end. They are human 
beings with families who just want to 
see justice served and see their loved 
ones home safe and sound.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4524 
April 27, 2022 
In light of the horrific treatment 
Paul has endured, I thank our wonder-
ful diplomats in Russia, particularly 
Ambassador John Sullivan, as well as 
Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, 
Roger Carstens, working under tremen-
dous pressure from the Russian Gov-
ernment to see that Paul Whelan, 
Brittney Griner, and other Americans 
detained in Russia are treated with 
dignity and that their human rights 
are respected. 
Good news today, we are thrilled that 
in large part due to their work, Trevor 
Reed is now on his way home. We can-
not stop until Paul’s family and other 
families with Americans detained over-
seas are given that same relief. These 
families work tirelessly to remind us 
that we cannot stop pushing—they de-
serve that same level of dedication 
from all of us. 
H. Res. 336, calling on the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation to pro-
vide evidence or to release United 
States citizen Paul Whelan, takes an-
other step toward securing that safe 
and swift release of American citizens 
from unjust detention abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this impor-
tant resolution and thank the gentle-
woman from Michigan for introducing 
it. I urge all Members to vote in sup-
port, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be here 
with Congressman DEAN PHILLIPS as we 
work together, unintentionally united 
by war criminal Putin, as Democrats 
and Republicans are united for free-
dom. 
Mr. Speaker, on December 28, 2018, 
U.S. citizen Paul Whelan was arrested 
in Moscow. On June 15, 2020, he was 
sentenced to 16 years in a Putin labor 
camp. He remains behind bars to this 
day for a crime he did not commit. No 
real evidence of Paul’s guilt was ever 
provided, defense witnesses were ex-
cluded, and he was denied a fair trial. 
U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan de-
scribed Paul’s wrongful conviction ex-
actly right—a mockery of justice. Paul 
is an American and a U.S. Marine 
Corps veteran. The U.S. Congress can-
not remain silent as Paul remains un-
justly held by the thug in the Kremlin. 
The resolution we are considering 
today shows we have not forgotten— 
and will never forget—Paul or any 
other American wrongfully detained in 
Russia. 
I was thrilled and relieved today to 
learn that Trevor Reed has been re-
leased from his unjust detention in 
Russia. Trevor, another former U.S. 
Marine, had spent years behind bars on 
completely fabricated charges. 
However, we cannot rest until Paul 
and every single wrongfully detained 
American is home safely with their 
families as well. 
As it launched its full-scale mur-
derous invasion of Ukraine, the Putin 
regime has stepped up its reprehensible 
practice of targeting Americans for un-
founded 
detentions. 
In 
February, 
Brittney Griner, a WNBA—that is the 
Women’s National Basketball Associa-
tion—player was arrested for allegedly 
bringing drugs into Russia. She faces 
up to 10 years in prison, if convicted. I 
fear she too will be held hostage by the 
Russian dictator. I appreciate her 
Member of Congress, SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE of Houston, for being such an out-
spoken proponent for her release. 
I would be remiss not to mention 
Vladimir Kara-Murza too. He is one of 
the fiercest advocates of a democratic 
Russia, who has been poisoned twice by 
the Putin regime, and who faces up to 
15 years in prison for speaking the 
truth about Putin’s unprovoked war of 
aggression and murder in Ukraine. He 
is a brave freedom fighter who does not 
deserve to be locked up for shining a 
light on Putin’s brutality and corrup-
tion. 
Putin 
must 
stop 
using 
innocent 
Americans as diplomatic pawns and re-
lease them immediately. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this resolution so Paul and 
his family know that the U.S. Congress 
stands with them, Democrats and Re-
publicans, and will do everything in 
our power to make sure Paul can join 
Trevor in coming back home. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1245 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today—as I have every day I have 
served in this very Chamber—on behalf 
of my constituent, Paul Whelan, who 
has been wrongfully detained in Russia 
since the end of December, 2018. 
Throughout Mr. Whelan’s detention, 
the Russian Government has repeat-
edly violated his rights, denied him 
proper medical care, and refused to 
provide any evidence to substantiate 
the charges against him. He was held 
in pretrial detention for over 18 months 
in the notorious Lefortovo Prison. 
Then Mr. Whelan’s trial was held be-
hind closed doors, and his defense was 
prohibited from calling witnesses. Mr. 
Whelan now serves a 16-year sentence 
of hard labor, and he is in his fifties. He 
is currently being held in a prison 
camp where he has been since August 
2020, facing unbelievably harsh condi-
tions, injury, and illness. 
Early this morning the news broke 
that fellow American, Trevor Reed, a 
marine and Texan who had also been 
wrongfully imprisoned in Russia, was 
freed through a prisoner swap orches-
trated by President Biden. This is in-
credible news. 
While this is incredible news for Mr. 
Reed and his family, let us say in this 
Chamber that Paul and his family de-
serve to experience the same joy and 
relief. Paul has been imprisoned longer 
than any other detained American in 
Russia. He has had years stolen from 
him, including precious time with his 
aging parents and siblings. One by one, 
he has lost his home in Novi, his job, 
his 
ability 
to 
communicate 
with 
friends, his beloved dog, Flora, and so 
much more. I want to see my con-
stituent of Novi, Michigan, back home. 
This innocent man has had his life 
and his livelihood stolen from him by 
Vladimir Putin. Today, we have the op-
portunity as a Congress to denounce 
Paul’s 
wrongful 
imprisonment 
and 
stand up to the lawlessness of the 
Putin regime. In the years since Paul’s 
detention, we have seen Mr. Putin fur-
ther isolate himself on the world stage 
as his government has dissolved into 
one of true lawlessness leading to 
threats and violence. We have all borne 
witness to the tragic loss of life of 
thousands of innocent Ukrainians and 
watched while a democratic nation is 
being destroyed at the directive of this 
dangerous war criminal. We must stand 
up from this Chamber. 
I thank my colleagues who have 
joined us. I thank Mr. KEATING, and I 
certainly recognize the chairman, Mr. 
MEEKS, and the ranking member, Mr. 
MCCAUL, for their attention to this 
matter. 
If Paul is watching this, he will know 
that I am praying for him, I am rooting 
for him, and I will never stop fighting 
for him. Let’s pass H. Res. 336 imme-
diately. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from South Carolina for the 
time, and, of course, I thank my friend, 
Mr. PHILLIPS, for leading the debate on 
this important issue. 
Once again, we gather on the House 
floor in unity—Republicans and Demo-
crats—to counter Putin’s behavior. 
Last year, I cofounded the first Con-
gressional Task Force for American 
Hostages and Americans Wrongfully 
Detained Abroad with my friend, TED 
DEUTCH, from Florida. 
I thank Representative STEVENS for 
being one of the first members of that 
task force, and that is why I rise in 
strong support of my friend HALEY STE-
VENS’ resolution which calls for the re-
lease of Paul Whelan who is, in fact, 
unjustly imprisoned in Russia. 
We have heard today in the debates 
some of the details of Paul’s arrest and 
nearly 2 years in pretrial detention 
with no evidence publicly presented 
justifying wrongdoing. 
All parts of our government, espe-
cially Members of Congress, who di-
rectly represent the families of those 
held hostage or wrongfully detained, 
must engage with friends and enemies 
alike, to ensure that Americans in sit-
uations like Paul Whelan’s are expedi-
tiously brought home. Further, Con-
gress must continue to engage with the 
administration in situations like these 
to disincentivize the wrongful deten-
tion or hostage taking of Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4525 
April 27, 2022 
Last year, we passed a similar resolu-
tion on this floor in support of Trevor 
Reed and Paul Whelan. It was, in fact, 
rewarding this morning to hear that 
Trevor was released; but, he should 
have never been held, and the exchange 
of prisoners should have never been 
necessary. 
But today, Mr. Speaker, on a com-
bined basis, Republicans and Demo-
crats, let us issue a message to Paul 
Whelan: We have not forgotten you. 
And let this message be clear that 
countries that engage in political hos-
tage taking must stop the disgraceful 
practice and be held accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support Representative STEVENS’ 
resolution. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 336 and, once again, call on 
the Russian Government to release 
American 
citizen, 
Paul 
Whelan. 
I 
thank my colleague, Congresswoman 
HALEY STEVENS, for her undying lead-
ership in fighting this travesty—and it 
is a travesty. 
It has now been over 3 years since 
Paul Whelan—a marine veteran, a 
Michigan resident, and, most impor-
tantly, an American citizen—was im-
prisoned in Russia without proper evi-
dence or a fair trial. It was a sham 
trial; that is the messaging Paul want-
ed to convey to the world as an unjust 
Russian judicial system handed out a 
ridiculous sentence. Throughout his de-
tainment, he has also been denied ac-
cess to proper medical treatment, de-
spite a sharp decline in his health. 
Just this week, I returned from 
Ukraine where Russian atrocities have 
been on display to the entire world. 
Make no mistake about that. We saw 
heartbreaking devastation that has im-
pacted so many lives. But tragically, 
Vladimir Putin’s barbaric behavior is 
not new. He has no concern for even 
the most basic of human rights. 
Today, the House must send an un-
equivocal message to the Kremlin: It is 
time to end the maltreatment of Paul 
Whelan. 
We just learned the good news that 
Trevor Reed, another American de-
tained in Russia, was released from 
prison. We are calling for Paul to be 
next. 
I want to close with a message to 
Paul’s dear parents, Rosemary and Ed, 
who live in my district in Manchester, 
Michigan; and to Paul’s siblings, Eliza-
beth, David, and Andrew. I know this 
has been an incredibly trying time for 
your family. I admire your resolve in 
the face of adversity. I grieve with you. 
I pray for you. And I continue to stand 
with you. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for Paul 
Whelan to come home to Michigan. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Rep-
resentative HALEY
STEVENS
for her 
work on this resolution. You can tell it 
is from the heart, and we are working 
together, 
again, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. 
How fortunate we are, with the lead-
ership of Congressman TIM WALBERG, 
to have spent the Orthodox Christian 
Easter weekend in Ukraine to visit 
with Lviv, to be in Kiev, to be in the 
Bucha region where the atrocities were 
so horrific, and to be on a delegation 
with Congresswoman VICTORIA SPARTZ, 
who was actually born in Soviet 
Ukraine, and now she has seen it be-
come a free Ukraine. Our country is so 
blessed by the number of Ukrainians 
who have come to live in our country 
and then support their maintenance, 
victory, and winning for freedom in 
Ukraine. 
As the world watches in horror at the 
war crimes and atrocities that the war 
criminal 
Putin 
is 
committing 
in 
Ukraine, we must also condemn the 
Russian dictator’s practice of exploit-
ing innocent Americans as political 
pawns. 
I urge my colleagues to join in sup-
porting this resolution. This will send 
a strong message to Paul and the other 
wrongfully detained Americans in Rus-
sia that Congress will not rest until 
they are returned home to their fami-
lies. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
I also thank my dear friend and col-
league from South Carolina for deliv-
ering to me a Ukraine-United States 
solidarity pin that I now wear proudly 
on my lapel. 
Freedom is at the core of our Amer-
ican values. It is the backbone of de-
mocracy. We have Americans stuck in 
Russia and around the world being held 
against their will and without expla-
nation to be used as political bar-
gaining chips. 
During this time of horrific atroc-
ities, their safe and secure release is all 
the more imperative. H. Res. 336 takes 
action to secure the safety of our fel-
low 
Americans, 
including 
Brittany 
Griner and Paul Whelan, who are at 
the mercy of Vladimir Putin, an evil 
dictator who has no regard for human 
life. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 336, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7314) to require the Secretary of 
State to submit to Congress a report 
on the People’s Republic of China’s 
support to the Russian Federation with 
respect to its unprovoked invasion of 
and full-scale war against Ukraine, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7314 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Assessing 
Xi’s Interference and Subversion Act’’ or 
‘‘AXIS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On February 4, 2022, weeks ahead of the 
Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, 
Russia and the People’s Republic of China re-
leased a joint statement following a meeting 
between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, 
which outlined a strategic partnership with 
‘‘no limits’’ and no ‘‘forbidden’’ areas for co-
operation. 
(2) On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded 
Ukraine in an unprovoked and unjustified 
act of war. 
(3) China abstained from voting on the 
February 25, 2022, United Nations Security 
Council resolution and the March 2, 2022, 
United Nations General Assembly resolution 
condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
(4) As of April 1, 2022, China has not pub-
licly condemned Russia’s unprovoked and il-
legal invasion of Ukraine. 
(5) In his call with Xi Jinping on March 18, 
2022, President Joe Biden communicated that 
there would be ‘‘implications and con-
sequences if China provides material support 
to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks 
against Ukrainian cities and civilians’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) 
the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China’s 
disinformation efforts relating to the Rus-
sian Federation’s war against Ukraine make 
it culpable in whitewashing Russia’s war 
crimes, which include the indiscriminate 
killing of countless Ukrainian men, women, 
and children; and 
(2) if China is found to be materially sup-
porting Russia in its war against Ukraine, 
there should be swift and stringent con-
sequences for China. 
SEC. 3. REPORT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act 
and every 90 days thereafter, the Secretary 
of State, in consultation with the Secretary 
of Commerce and the Director of National 
Intelligence as appropriate, shall submit to 
the appropriate congressional committees a 
report on whether and how the People’s Re-
public of China, including the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese 
Communist Party, any Chinese state-owned 
enterprise, and any other Chinese entity, has 
provided support to the Russian Federation 
with respect to its unprovoked invasion of 
and full-scale war against Ukraine. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The report 
required by subsection (a) shall include a dis-
cussion of the People’s Republic of China 
support to the Russian Federation with re-
spect to— 
(1) helping the Government of Russia or 
Russian entities evade or circumvent United

section (a) shall be submitted in unclassified 
form and published on the Department of 
State’s publicly available website. 
(d) SUNSET.—The requirement to submit 
the report required by subsection (a) shall 
terminate on the earlier of— 
(1) the date on which the Secretary of 
State determines the conflict in Ukraine has 
ended; or 
(2) the date that is 2 years after the date of 
the enactment of this Act. 
(e) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations

and Urban Affairs of the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7314, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7314, the AXIS Act, authored by 
our committee colleague, Representa-
tive ANDY BARR. 
The world watched in horror as Rus-
sia launched its latest invasion of 
Ukraine, marking an egregious viola-
tion of Ukrainian sovereignty and a 
disdain 
for 
the 
rules-based 
inter-
national order. Russia has mercilessly 
killed thousands of innocent civilians. 
Graphic images of death and destruc-
tion from Bucha and Mariupol lay bare: 
There is no defense for Putin’s bar-
barity. 
Amid this carnage, the international 
community has overwhelmingly come 
together to condemn Russia’s brutal, 
unprovoked aggression against Ukraine 
and hold Russia accountable for the 
gross atrocities being committed. 
While China has tried to distance 
itself from Russia’s war of choice 
against Ukraine, it has, at best, re-
mained neutral in the face of this vio-
lence, demonstrating a woeful abdica-
tion of its self-proclaimed role as a re-
sponsible stakeholder. Worse, growing 
signs indicate China is aligning itself 
more closely with Russia. 
Just 
before 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, President Putin and Chair-
man Xi released a joint statement call-
ing for closer strategic cooperation. 
While China has publicly denied any 
foreknowledge of the invasion, it dis-
counted and ignored American intel-
ligence 
showing 
Russian 
buildup 
around Ukraine. At no point since the 
invasion began has China condemned 
Russia for its invasion nor for its sub-
sequent human rights atrocities. 
The PRC has chosen to employ a 
disinformation 
campaign 
to 
spread 
harmful narratives about Russia’s as-
sault on Ukraine. Both within China 
and abroad, the PRC is promoting Rus-
sian propaganda about the war and 
echoing Russian’s absurd justifications 
for the invasion, going so far as accus-
ing the United States for Russia’s one- 
sided aggression. 
President Biden has warned China 
that there will be consequences if it de-
cides to materially support Russia’s 
war or helps it skirt U.S. export con-
trols and sanctions. H.R. 7314 would re-
quire the Secretary of State to report 
on any efforts made by the PRC to sup-
port Russia’s unprovoked, unjust, and 
illegal invasion of Ukraine. 
This bipartisan measure is vital to 
ensure Congress and the American peo-
ple stay informed about how, if at all, 
China might be supporting Russia in 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I support swift passage 
of this timely and urgent bill, I urge 
my colleagues to do the same, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
AXIS Act, A-X-I-S, a bill that is to re-
quire the Department of State to re-
port on China’s support of Putin’s 
unprovoked, 
full-scale 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist 
Party is complicit in Russia’s crimes 
against the people of Ukraine. 
Xi and Putin established a no-limits 
partnership with their joint statement 
that foolishly cast NATO as an aggres-
sor. They coordinated the timing of the 
invasion to avoid disturbing the CCP’s 
genocide Olympics. The Chinese state 
media has regurgitated Russian propa-
ganda, and instead of joining the world 
in sanctioning Putin, the CCP is work-
ing with Putin to avoid sanctions. 
b 1300 
We are already seeing the results of 
this unholy alliance between the two 
dictators, and it is essential that CCP 
support of the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine become a matter of public 
record. 
I thank our colleague from Kentucky 
(Mr. BARR) for introducing the AXIS 
Act. This bill requires an unclassified 
report on the full scope of CCP support 
of the Putin invasion, from sanctions 
violations, to disinformation, to the 
sale of controlled technology. 
If the United States is going to 
counter the national security threat of 
this new axis of autocrats working to-
gether, we must understand how they 
are working together in the conflict be-
tween autocrats, which are ruled by 
gun, against democracy, which is ruled 
by law. 
Mr. BARR’s bill fills this need. I 
thank the gentleman for introducing 
the AXIS Act, and I urge our col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from South Carolina for his 
leadership on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, his leadership in the Congress, 
and his advocacy for the free people of 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, as the United States, 
our NATO allies, and other allies re-
spond to Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked 
and brutal attack on the free, sov-
ereign, 
and 
independent 
nation 
of 
Ukraine, we must assess the many 
ways in which Russia is seeking to 
evade sanctions. That includes the ex-
tent to which Russia is turning to 
China to enable its aggression. 
Mr. Speaker, the unholy alliance be-
tween the Chinese Communist Party 
and the authoritarian oligarchs run-
ning the Kremlin is a serious threat to 
the United States and our allies. It is 
enabling this illegal aggression against 
Ukraine. 
On February 4, Russia and the CCP 
released a joint statement following a 
meeting with Vladimir Putin and Xi 
Jinping outlining a strategic partner-
ship with ‘‘no limits.’’ 
Following Russia’s illegal invasion of 
Ukraine, China refused to condemn 
Russia’s 
gross 
violation 
of 
inter-
national law. China has continued to 
be silent while Russia targets and kills 
innocent women, children, and civil-
ians in Ukraine. 
Instead of condemning Putin’s war 
crimes, the CCP is rewarding them. On 
February 28, after the invasion, the 
CCP struck a massive deal with the 
Russian 
energy 
company 
Gazprom. 
Gazprom will deliver 50 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas per year to the 
CCP under the agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for the United 
States to confront this new axis of evil

head-on. My legislation, the Assessing 
Xi’s Interference and Subversion Act, 
or the AXIS Act, requires the U.S. 
State Department to submit an ongo-
ing report to Congress detailing the 
CCP’s support for Russia before and 
since the invasion of Ukraine. This in-
cludes troubling reports about CCP ef-
forts to assist Russia in evading the ef-
fects of international sanctions. 
The AXIS Act also requires the State 
Department to submit its first report 
to Congress within 30 days of the bill 
being enacted and 90 days thereafter. I 
plan on receiving a commitment from 
Secretary Blinken at tomorrow’s For-
eign Affairs Committee hearing that he 
will comply with this deadline. 
I thank my Democratic and Repub-
lican colleagues on the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, including Chair-
man MEEKS
and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, for their support. I thank my 
friend from Minnesota for his support 
of this legislation, and I thank my 
friend from South Carolina, as well, for 
helping us unanimously pass this bill 
out of committee. 
The threat that this new axis of evil 
poses to the United States is not a Re-
publican one or a Democratic one. It is 
an American one. This full report on 
the Russia-CCP alliance will inform 
the American public and enable law-
makers to begin positioning the United 
States to overcome this geopolitical 
challenge. 
As a member of the House China 
Task Force, and with my strong belief 
that freedom must be defended from 
the aggression of authoritarians, like 
this invasion that we have seen, we 
must confront it; we must repel it; and 
we must call it out when we see it. 
That is why I urge all of my colleagues 
in the House to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Mr. WILSON for yielding and for 
his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the AXIS Act. We must take strong 
steps to investigate if and how the Chi-
nese Government and affiliated enti-
ties are helping Russia evade sanctions 
after Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked in-
vasion of Ukraine. 
While the United States, our NATO 
allies, and countries around the world 
have strongly condemned and taken ac-
tion during Vladimir Putin’s invasion, 
the silence and deference from Chinese 
Government officials is deafening. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi 
continues to say Russia is China’s most 
important strategic partner. We know 
that as Russia continues to invade 
Ukraine, China is eyeing Taiwan. We 
must show dictators that they cannot 
invade 
a 
free 
country 
and 
ally 
unprovoked without consequences. 
I am proud to cosponsor the AXIS 
Act, and I thank my friend, Congress-
man ANDY BARR, for leading this bill. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I especially appreciate 
the people of China. My father served 
in 1944 as a member of the Flying Ti-
gers, the 14th Air Force of the Army 
Air Corps of the United States, to de-
fend the people of China in World War 
II. He served in Kunming, Chengdu, and 
Xi’an, and he had a deep affection for 
the people of China. We want the best 
for the people of China. 
Sadly, at every step of Russia’s 
unprovoked, 
full-scale 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, the CCP has chosen to reject 
the free world and embrace Putin’s 
mass murder. Just last week, one of 
the CCP’s top Foreign Ministry offi-
cials promised to increase strategic co-
ordination with Russia, regardless of 
Russia’s war crimes. But we know that 
Ukraine will win with the leadership of 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
They need to be held accountable at 
the 
CCP, 
and 
Congressman 
ANDY 
BARR’s legislation does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may consume 
for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, when it comes to China 
and Russia, I do not trust empty words; 
I verify. 
H.R. 7314, the AXIS Act, will help 
Congress and the American people stay 
informed about how, if at all, China 
might be supporting Russia in its 
unprovoked, unjust, and illegal inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
It is of the utmost importance for 
this body and the world to understand 
whether China is complicit in the gross 
atrocities and war crimes being com-
mitted against the Ukrainian people. 
Doing so will allow us to adjust our 
strategies and policies as necessary to 
further isolate Russia and deepen sup-
port for the Ukrainian people. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7314, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
PROTECTING 
SEMICONDUCTOR 
SUPPLY 
CHAIN 
MATERIALS 
FROM AUTHORITARIANS ACT 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7372) to amend the Ukraine Free-
dom Support Act of 2014 to require the 
President to establish a semiconductor 
supply chain working group in response 
to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and 
submit reports to Congress on poten-
tial future disruptions to the supply 
chain.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7372. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7372, the Protecting Semicon-
ductor Supply Chain Materials from 
Authoritarians Act. 
The pandemic has exposed how intri-
cate, how fragile, and how globalized 
supply chains are in 2022. Many of the 
products our families know and use 
every day, whether it is our cars, our 
computers, our smartphones, or our re-
frigerators, are the products of com-
plex components assembled all around 
the globe. Semiconductors are a prime 
example, as they power just about 
every electronic device in existence. 
America is the global leader in semi-
conductors because our semiconductor 
design companies are the global lead-
ers. No country is capable of making 
advanced 
semiconductors 
without 
American innovation and know-how. 
But we are also reliant on other na-
tions that are a part of the semicon-
ductor supply chain. Ukraine and Rus-
sia are crucial providers of important 
compounds and elements that are nec-
essary for their production, including 
palladium, neon gas, helium, and C4F6. 
Without these gases, many types of 
semiconductors cannot be produced. 
Most chip-making companies had a lit-
tle extra supply of these products be-
fore Putin started his immoral, un-
justifiable invasion, but these stores 
are quickly dwindling. 
This bill directs the President to 
quickly address this problem and forces 
the administration to work with our 
allies and partners to ramp up produc-
tion of these key elements and com-
pounds. It also asks the administration 
to look ahead to future geopolitical 
threats and analyze how we can pre-
pare for potential instability down the 
road. 
I thank Representative TITUS for her 
work on this important bill and for 
working in a bipartisan way with Rep-
resentative MEIJER. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this valuable legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Protecting Semiconductor Sup-
ply Chain Materials from Authoritar-
ians Act. 
H.R. 7372 would set up a high-level 
interagency task force to make sure 
that we have a whole-of-government ef-
fort to anticipate and respond to the 
impacts on the supply chain for semi-
conductors. 
The semiconductor supply chain has 
long been under strain, which has only 
been exacerbated by the COVID pan-
demic. On top of that, the war criminal 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has only 
added to the problem. It has inter-
rupted critical inputs into the semicon-
ductor supply chain, such as palladium, 
neon gas, and helium. 
While it certainly is important to 
know the impacts on this critical sup-
ply chain caused by Russia’s invasion, 
the United States must take a holistic 
approach and work with our allies and 
partners to strengthen the entire semi-
conductor supply chain and protect it 
from being dominated by the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
I am pleased that this bill also re-
quires forward-looking assessments to 
understand the impact to the supply 
chain by a possible invasion of Taiwan, 
a courageous beacon of democracy in 
the East that manufactures 90 percent 
of advanced logic semiconductors. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 7372, 
the Protecting Semiconductor Supply 
Chain Materials from Authoritarians 
Act. 
This bill, which I helped introduce 
with Representative TITUS, is an in-
credibly timely bill and focuses on two 
of the most pressing issues today: the 
war in Ukraine and our semiconductor 
supply chain shortages. 
Over the past 2 years, we have seen 
unprecedented challenges to our supply 
chain. The current war in Ukraine has 
exacerbated each and every one of 
these challenges, threatening our sup-
ply of critical minerals, including the 
supply for semiconductors. 
b 1315 
From cell phones and cars to medical 
devices, we all know the integral role 
that semiconductors play in our every-
day lives. My home State of Michigan 
knows all too well the challenges that 
the semiconductor shortage have cre-
ated for our economy. A threat to our 
supply chains is a matter of both eco-
nomic and national security, and we 
need a robust and coordinated response 
to any threats to our semiconductor 
supply chain. This bill offers just that. 
By establishing a working group fo-
cused specifically on the threats to our 
semiconductor supply chain as a result 
of Putin’s illegal war of aggression in 
Ukraine, we can ensure that all avail-
able resources and expertise are being 
used to examine how our critical min-
eral supply is affected by the ongoing 
war. This legislation also examines 
how we can bolster our supply of crit-
ical minerals, as well as how we in Con-
gress can offer legislative solutions to 
help support and strengthen our supply 
chains. 
We know now that our global supply 
chain is at a critical juncture, and if it 
can be disrupted for semiconductors, 
the threats will be endless to our eco-
nomic and national security. This leg-
islation allows us to take meaningful 
steps to identify how the ongoing war 
threatens the chain and what we can 
do to shore up our supply domestically. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for leading 
this effort, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4529 
April 27, 2022 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume to close. 
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. share of global 
semiconductor production has dropped 
from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent 
today, and it is projected to decline 
even further without a comprehensive 
U.S. strategy to support the industry. 
This bill is a small step in the right 
direction, but we must do more to en-
sure these vital supply chains for semi-
conductors. If we fail, the impacts to 
our economy and national security will 
be monumental. 
We are in a conflict of democracy 
with rule by law opposed by authori-
tarians of rule by gun. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
H.R. 7372 is important legislation 
that will take practical steps to solve 
supply chain problems that would af-
fect all Americans in a bipartisan way. 
This is exactly the type of work we 
were elected to do. I applaud the gen-
tlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) and 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
MEIJER) for their work on the Pro-
tecting Semiconductor Supply Chain 
Materials from Authoritarians Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7372. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.

UKRAINE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
SUPPORT ACT 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 496) to oppose violations of reli-
gious freedom in Ukraine by Russia 
and armed groups commanded by Rus-
sia, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 496 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine Re-
ligious Freedom Support Act’’. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to never recognize the illegal, at-
tempted annexation of Crimea by the Gov-
ernment of the Russia or the separation 
through the use of military force or recogni-
tion of independence of any portion of 
Ukrainian territory; and 
(2) to consider any alien who, while serving 
as an official of the Government of Russia, 
was responsible for or directly carried out 
particularly severe violations of religious 
freedom 
in 
the 
sovereign 
territory 
of 
Ukraine that Russia illegally occupies, con-
trols, or recognizes as independent, including 
through non-state armed groups and illegal 
entities it commands or otherwise supports 
or which act on Russia’s behalf, to have com-
mitted particularly severe violations of reli-
gious freedom for purposes of applying sec-
tion 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with re-
spect to any such alien. 
SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF RUSSIA AS A COUNTRY 
OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR RE-
LIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
For purposes of making a determination of 
whether to designate Russia as a country of 
particular concern for religious freedom 
under section 402 of the International Reli-
gious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442), 
the President shall consider any particularly 
severe violation of religious freedom in the 
territory of Ukraine that Russia illegally oc-
cupies, controls, or recognizes as inde-
pendent, including through non-state armed 
groups and illegal entities it commands or 
otherwise supports or which act on Russia’s 
behalf, during the period of time that is the 
basis for the determination and designation, 
to be a particularly severe violation of reli-
gious freedom that the Government of Rus-
sia has engaged in or tolerated. 
øSEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage.¿ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 496, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 496, 
the Ukraine Religious Freedom Sup-
port Act, and thank my committee col-
league and friend, the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), for intro-
ducing it. 
As we speak here in this Chamber, 
Russian forces are ravaging Ukrainian 
cities and towns. They are committing 
unspeakable atrocities and war crimes 
against innocent civilians and con-
tinuing to wage an unprovoked and un-
justified war. The world cannot and 
will not overlook or forget Russia’s 
heinous acts of aggression, nor the war 
crimes and other human rights viola-
tions it is committing. 
But, sadly, Russia’s human rights 
violations against Ukrainian civilians 
and on sovereign Ukrainian territory 
started well before February of this 
year. Ever since Russia illegally at-
tempted to annex Crimea and backed 
the separatists in the Donbas region, 
Russia and Russian-backed forces, as 
well as the so-called authorities in 
those regions, have demonstrated a 
complete disregard for human rights, 
including the rights of Ukrainians and 
others to practice their religions free-
ly. 
That is why H.R. 496 is so critically 
important. We must hold accountable 
those Russians and Russian-backed in-
dividuals responsible for committing 
severe violations of religious freedom 
on Ukrainian sovereign territory. Not 
only must we ensure that it is held ac-
countable for the daily human rights 
violations that characterize its illegal 
war in Ukraine, but also for those com-
mitted long before this latest invasion. 
Given that the U.S. may take ac-
tions, including by withdrawing devel-
opment assistance, against countries 
who defy religious freedoms protected 
under U.S. Federal law, H.R. 496 directs 
the President to include Russia-con-
trolled areas and groups when deter-
mining concern for religious freedoms 
and funding eligibility for Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this impor-
tant legislation and thank the gen-
tleman from South Carolina once again 
for introducing it. I urge all Members 
to vote in support, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, April 20, 2022. 
Hon. GREGORY MEEKS, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House 
of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MEEKS: This letter is to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4530 
April 27, 2022 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, April 21, 2022. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Committee on the Judiciary, House of Rep-
resentatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 496, Ukraine Religious 
Freedom Support Act, as amended. I appre-
ciate your willingness to work cooperatively 
on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on the Judiciary under House Rule X, and 
that your Committee will forgo action on 
H.R. 496 to expedite floor consideration. I 
further acknowledge that the inaction of 
your Committee with respect to the bill does 
not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I also acknowl-
edge that your Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward, and will 
support the appointment of Committee on 
the Judiciary conferees during any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of a bill that I am grateful to have in-
troduced with the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLEAVER), my longtime 
friend and codel colleague, the Ukraine 
Religious Freedom Support Act. 
It is important that we first ac-
knowledge the heinous escalation by 
the war criminal Putin, as he con-
tinues to wage a one-sided, full-scale 
war in sovereign, democratic Ukraine. 
Putin’s war in Ukraine and illegal oc-
cupation of Crimea have dragged on for 
8 years. The human toll is staggering. 
Prior to the full-scale invasion, fight-
ing in the Russian-occupied regions 
had already claimed over 13,000 Ukrain-
ian lives, including thousands of inno-
cent civilians. That is even before the 
current invasion. 
Another casualty of Russian aggres-
sion in Ukraine has been the attack on 
religious freedom. Russian occupation 
authorities in Crimea continue to per-
secute and intimidate the minority 
Christian, Muslim, and other religious 
groups, like the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
Putin’s puppets in Crimea during the 
duration of their occupation subjected 
them to kidnappings, torture, forced 
psychiatric examinations, and impris-
onment. Muslim Crimean Tatars have 
been sentenced to serve lengthy terms 
in Russian prisons on the entirely base-
less charge of terrorism. 
Minority religious groups in the area 
of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro- 
Putin proxies have also been forced to 
flee in order to escape the oppressive 
conditions. The religious persecution 
in Ukraine being committed at the 
hands of the Putin authorities is self- 
destructive and must be stopped. 
Throughout American history, the 
United States has worked tirelessly to 
advance religious freedom and protect 
religious minorities around the globe. 
The bill follows that strong tradition 
by accomplishing the following: 
One, making clear that it is the pol-
icy of the United States to never recog-
nize the illegal attempted annexation 
of Crimea by Russia or the separation 
through the use of military force or 
recognition of independence of any por-
tion of Ukrainian territory; 
Second, it helps ensure that war 
criminal Putin and his cronies are held 
accountable by considering any official 
involved in carrying out severe viola-
tions of human rights in sovereign 
Ukrainian territory by applying the 
provisions of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act. 
Three, additionally, this legislation 
requires a determination of whether to 
designate Russia as a country of con-
cern for religious freedom. 
We cannot allow these grave viola-
tions to continue. It is vital that the 
United States continues to be a leader 
in advancing international religious 
freedom around the world. 
This bill not only brings inter-
national attention to the religious per-
secution being committed in the terri-
tory of Ukraine that Putin illegally oc-
cupies 
or 
controls 
through 
illegal 
armed groups it commands, but also 
ensures that war criminal Putin and 
his thugs are held accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is vital that the 
United States continue its tradition of 
advancing 
religious 
freedom 
and 
human rights around the world. 
This bill brings accountability to the 
Putin regime for its crimes of oppress-
ing religious minorities as it illegally 
occupies sovereign Ukrainian territory. 
Additionally, it is so critical that the 
United States continue to send a clear 
message that it will never recognize 
Putin’s illegal occupation of sovereign 
Ukrainian territory. 
Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of 
the Helsinki Commission, I especially 
recognize our dear friend, the late 
Chairman Alcee Hastings for cham-
pioning this issue and the Helsinki 
Commission for prioritizing human 
rights and holding war criminal Putin 
accountable for his continued viola-
tions of human rights and religious lib-
erty in Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
I thank my friend and colleague from 
South Carolina. He is a gentleman and 
a 
champion 
of 
religious 
freedoms 
around the world. This is an example of 
what this institution, and we Ameri-
cans can do together when we find 
common ground and set our minds to it 
in the face of such aggression and risk 
around the world. 
Putin’s flagrant violations of the 
basic human rights of Ukrainian civil-
ians on Ukraine’s sovereign territory 
are disturbing, and they are unaccept-
able. Freedom of religion is a moral 
imperative that the United States 
must continue to strive to defend as we 
support the people of Ukraine through 
these incredibly trying and horrific 
times. 
This is personal to me. My own fam-
ily fled Russian persecution during the 
pogroms of the late 19th century to 
come to this extraordinary country. 
Little could they have imagined that I 
would be standing here with you, my 
friend from South Carolina, talking 
about religious freedoms and doing ev-
erything we can as a country to pre-
serve and protect those all around the 
world. That is what it means to be an 
American, not just here, but all around 
the world. 
We must take action where we can, 
including by ensuring that the Presi-
dent considers all regions where Rus-
sian influence is determining future de-
velopment funding for the Nation. I 
trust my colleagues will join me in 
supporting this terribly important bill 
to defend these freedoms all around the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the

There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 6930, the Asset 
Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction 
Act, as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, we have long known the 
Russian oligarch class is an important 
pillar of President Putin’s brutal and 
corrupt 
regime. 
These 
Russian 
oligarchs have been able to enrich 
themselves and use their wealth to 
consolidate power within their country 
and increase their influence abroad. 
As President Putin continues in his 
unjustified and premeditated full-scale 
invasion into Ukraine, the United 
States must do all that it can to iden-
tify 
and 
sanction 
his 
cronies 
bankrolling this brutality. 
The Asset Seizure for Ukraine Recon-
struction Act, as amended, takes an 
important step in this direction. The 
bill expresses the sense of Congress 
that the President should confiscate 
property subject to U.S. jurisdiction 
worth over $2 million belonging to Rus-
sian energy companies or Russian 
oligarchs whose wealth is derived from 
corruption or by support of President 
Putin. It expresses the sense that such 
property should be held, used, adminis-
tered, liquidated, or sold, and that any 
funds gained from such sale should be 
used to benefit the Ukrainian people. 
Furthermore, this legislation would 
also create an interagency working 
group to determine the proper con-
stitutional mechanisms through which 
this could be achieved. 
The luxury villas and fancy yachts 
and private airplanes of Putin and his 
cronies are tainted with the blood of 
the Ukrainian people. Their corrupt as-
sets should be seized and should be 
used to rebuild Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Sadly, on February 24, war criminal 
Putin launched an unprovoked, un-
justified murderous war of aggression 
against the people of Ukraine. 
The humanitarian toll has been dev-
astating. More than 5 million refugees 
have fled Ukraine. More than 7 million 
are believed to be internally displaced, 
and we have seen on our screens the 
heart-wrenching images of Putin’s hor-
rific war crimes in Bucha, Mariupol, 
and elsewhere. 
The economic toll for Ukraine is no 
less devastating. The World Bank has 
forecasted 
that 
Ukraine’s 
economy 
could contract by 45 percent this year 
with a worst-case scenario seeing its 
GDP shrink by 75 percent. 
The Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys 
Shmyhal said last week during a visit 
to Washington, that Ukraine would 
need around $5 billion a month in budg-
etary support as long as the war con-
tinued and then roughly $600 billion for 
a broader rebuilding effort. 
To rebuild this country, the Ukrain-
ian Prime Minister requested not only 
additional financial support from the 
United States and its allies and part-
ners, but also the transfer of Russian 
assets that have been frozen by the 
global sanctions regime to Ukraine. 
The U.S. must answer this call. 
The resolution we are considering 
urges the President to establish an 
interagency working group to deter-
mine the constitutional mechanisms 
through which the United States could 
not only freeze but seize the assets of 
Russian oligarchs within the United 
States if this property was derived 
through corruption linked to the Putin 
regime. 
The 
liquidated 
funds 
are 
to 
be 
repurposed for the benefit of the people 
of Ukraine, including post-conflict re-
construction when the Ukrainians win, 
humanitarian assistance, and assist-
ance for the security forces of the Gov-
ernment of Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4532 
April 27, 2022 
I was grateful to colead this legisla-
tion 
with 
our 
colleague, 
TOM 
MALINOWSKI of New Jersey. Thanks to 
an amendment from our colleague, 
PETER MEIJER, the bill also urges the 
administration to expand sanctions on 
members of the Russian Parliament, 
the duma, who voted in support of rec-
ognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk 
People’s Republic, which are illegal 
fabrications. This vote served as part 
of 
Putin’s 
pretext 
to 
Russia’s 
unprovoked and unjustified war of ag-
gression against the people of Ukraine. 
Anyone who supported that vote must 
fall under U.S. sanctions—full stop. 
The administration needs to seriously 
consider how we can use the frozen 
Russian assets to help Ukraine fight 
and continue winning, then rebuild its 
country. Therefore, I urge all col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Asset 
Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction 
Act, which I was proud to help intro-
duce with my colleague, Congressman 
MALINOWSKI. 
This bill sends a strong and clear 
message of support to the Ukrainian 
people and a clear message to Putin 
and his cronies that their ill-gotten as-
sets are no longer welcome in the 
United States. 
The Asset Seizure for Ukraine Recon-
struction Act encourages the adminis-
tration to take necessary steps allowed 
by the Constitution and existing laws 
to seize Russian assets valued over $2 
million and repurpose them towards 
post-conflict reconstruction and hu-
manitarian assistance in Ukraine. 
It also includes my amendment that 
aims to expand sanctions on members 
of Russia’s Parliament who took the 
reckless and illegal vote to recognize 
two breakaway states in the Donbas 
and authorize Putin to use military 
force in Ukraine. 
Although the Biden administration 
sanctioned 328 duma members who 
voted on February 15 for a resolution 
calling on Putin to recognize the 
Ukrainian breakaway states, the so- 
called Luhansk People’s Republic and 
Donetsk People’s Republic, it has still 
not imposed similar sanctions on the 
remaining duma members and the 154 
members of the Federation Council 
who voted just one week later to au-
thorize 
Putin’s 
senseless 
war 
in 
Ukraine. 
These Russian politicians, as well as 
the oligarchs who so comfortably store 
their assets on U.S. territory, play a 
role in Putin’s illegal war, and they all 
deserve to be punished. Our bill ensures 
that they do not escape accountability 
for their complicity in the atrocities 
against Ukraine, which has left thou-
sands of civilians dead, and many mil-
lions displaced. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
critical and urgent bill. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, rather than financing 
war crimes in Ukraine and multi-
million-dollar yachts and real estate 
for Putin’s cronies, this money could 
be much better spent on urgently need-
ed humanitarian aid and weapons for 
Ukraine. 
This makes sense for the people of 
Ukraine as well as for the American 
taxpayer. I, therefore, urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the Asset Seizure for 
Ukraine Reconstruction Act, as amend-
ed, sends a statement to Vladimir 
Putin and his cronies that the U.S. 
Congress will make sure the United 
States is not a safe haven for their cor-
rupt assets. 
The legislation makes it clear that 
the President should take measures to 
seize and confiscate their assets sub-
ject to U.S. jurisdiction and use the 
proceeds from such sales to help the 
Ukrainian people, all while protecting 
and preserving the rights enshrined in 
our Constitution. 
I thank Representative MALINOWSKI 
for authoring the bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support the legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6930, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

TITLE III—DETERMINATION OF 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
SEC. 301. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 923, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the au-
thor of the Georgia Support Act and as 
co-chair of the Congressional Georgia 
Caucus to express my support for this 
legislation, which we introduced with 
my Republican colleague and Georgia 
Caucus co-chair, Mr. ADAM KINZINGER 
of Illinois. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation has 
twice passed the House with broad bi-
partisan support. This bipartisan effort 
enhances the U.S.-Georgia relationship 
on several fronts by bolstering security 
assistance, promoting democratic gov-
ernance reforms, enhancing coopera-
tion to fight Russian disinformation, 
and strengthening economic ties. 
Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate, as 
Russia continues its tragic and horrific 
invasion of sovereign Ukrainian terri-
tory, that we reflect on 2008 and the in-
vasion by Russia and continued occu-
pation of sovereign Georgian territory 
in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
To this day, Russian troops commit-
ting abhorrent violations of human 
rights, 
international 
humanitarian 
law, and war crimes in sovereign 
Ukrainian 
territory 
are 
the 
same 
troops that have fomented unrest, 
aided separatist movements, and com-
mitted clear and evident violations of 
human rights for the past 14 years in 
the Russian-occupied parts of Georgia. 
This bill directs the United States 
Government to enforce targeted sanc-
tions on malign actors committing 
these violations in Russian-occupied 
territory. 
The Georgia Support Act also re-
quires the administration to examine 
how best we can utilize the $35 million 
or more of United States aid that we 
provide Georgia in security assistance 
every year and reinforces U.S. policy to 
never recognize Russian sovereignty 
over Georgia territory. 
As the number one per capita con-
tributor of forces in Afghanistan, Geor-
gia has demonstrated its dedication to 
security cooperation with the West. 
The United States must continue to re-
ciprocate by helping Georgia develop 
the capacity to defend itself against 
further incursion of Russian forces. 
Mr. Speaker, attacks on Georgian 
sovereignty 
have 
not 
been 
simply 
through the occupation of Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia, as bad as that is. 
This bill directs the administration to 
enhance cooperation with our Georgian 
partners to help them defend them-
selves from the various cyberattacks 
and disinformation and propaganda 
campaigns Russia has launched with 
the goal of undermining the sov-
ereignty and democratic institutions of 
the Country of Georgia. 
Mr. Speaker, I traveled to Tbilisi nu-
merous times, both with the NATO 
Parliamentary Assembly, of which I 
am President, and with the House De-
mocracy Partnership to meet with gov-
ernment officials, civil society, and the 
Georgian people. 
I am pleased that this iteration of 
the Georgia Support Act seeks to but-
tress Georgian democratic institutions 
through U.S. democracy and govern-
ance programs that promote Georgian 
judicial independence, electoral 
re-
forms, freedom of the press, and ac-
countability 
for 
attacks 
on 
inde-
pendent media and Tbilisi Pride activ-
ists in 2021. 
This legislation provides an oppor-
tunity for the United States to express 
its robust, bipartisan support for Geor-
gia’s 
sovereignty, 
continued 
demo-
cratic and economic development, and 
security against renewed Russian ag-
gression. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Georgia Support Act, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
as well of H.R. 923, the Georgia Support 
Act. 
Since Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, 
Putin has illegally occupied 20 percent 
of 
Georgia’s 
territory, 
embroiling 
Georgia in an existential battle for its 
sovereignty. 
The ongoing, flagrant invasion of 
Ukraine proves that Putin will stop at 
nothing to accomplish his heinous 
goals. Our allies in Georgia need strong 
U.S. support now more than ever. It 
must be made abundantly clear to 
Putin that the American people stand 
with Georgia and will not tolerate a 
further incursion into Georgia’s terri-
tory. 
This bill will reaffirm U.S. support 
for 
Georgia’s 
independence, 
sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity by 
authorizing a review of security assist-
ance to Georgia to determine key capa-
bility gaps, as well as looking at U.S.- 
Georgia cybersecurity cooperation and 
assistance 
to 
combat 
Russian 
disinformation. 
b 1345 
Russian meddling in Georgia’s polit-
ical 
processes 
and 
active 
disinformation campaigns continue to 
threaten Georgia’s democratic trajec-
tory. 
But critically, the bill also addresses 
the need for Georgia to maintain its 
focus on democracy and governance de-
velopment in order to stay on its Euro- 
Atlantic path. 
Finally, 
this 
bill 
authorizes 
the 
President to impose sanctions on indi-
viduals responsible for human rights 
abuses in Georgia’s occupied terri-
tories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
By erecting and constantly moving 
the border further into Georgia’s terri-
tory, restricting freedom of movement 
and conducting arbitrary detentions, 
killings, and kidnappings, Putin has 
jeopardized the lives of all Georgians 
on both sides of the boundary line with 
his occupied territories. 
Passing this bill is a timely oppor-
tunity to show support for an ally that 
has been on the front line of Putin’s 
belligerence for well over a decade. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow Putin 
to believe he can turn to Georgia next 
after 
his 
despicable 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. Georgia, a longstanding U.S. 
partner in a tough neighborhood, has 
for too long been on the front line of 
Putin’s unchecked aggression. 
This bill passed in the House the last 
two Congresses by an overwhelming bi-
partisan majority, and I urge my col-
leagues to support our Georgian allies 
yet again. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank my friend for his support. 
And I think it is very important that 
there be a clarion statement from this 
Congress, not only about Ukraine, but 
about other nations that are threat-
ened by Russian aggression; Georgia 
and Moldova are two of the most 
prominent. 
It is critical that the Congress speak 
with one voice to those nations, to 
those peoples, and to Vladimir Putin 
and Russia, should he have further de-
signs on either of those two countries. 
So I think this is an important piece 
of legislation. I urge its passage, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I, 
for many, many decades, have had a strong 
and very deep commitment to the people of 
the Republic of Georgia. As a matter of fact, 
after Russia invaded South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia in 2008, I traveled to Tbilisi, and 
spent a week there, with a people at war. 
As it turned out, there were three young 
people from my district who were stuck behind 
enemy lines. One being held up in and very 
fearful in Abkhazia, and two who were in 
South Ossetia. And when I went, several 
Members of Congress gave me names of peo-
ple that were also behind the South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia Russia-dominated lines. It was 
very tense, with Chechens walking around 
with guns, drunk and committing atrocities. We 
were all concerned. 
Within a week or so, we got all of the chil-
dren out. We worked with the OSCE mission 
there, we worked with the International Com-
mittee of the Red Cross, and with the French, 
who had the chair in office that year for the 
European Union. That ambassador actually 
traveled to the place where the two children in 
South Ossetia were, put them in his car, and 
brought them to safety. 
So, Georgia and the importance of our 
strong friendship with the Georgian people,

April 27, 2022 
and their heroic resistance to Russia, has al-
ways been close to my heart. 
And also, I note that past is prologue. 
The same justifications Putin used for invad-
ing Crimea—that they were going in to liberate 
Russians—was the exact same pretext used 
in Georgia. What a lie and deception that was 
and is. Putin simply seeks to reconstitute the 
Soviet empire under himself. 
So I’m very supportive of the intent behind 
the legislation. 
I had offered an amendment at markup, 
which was voted down on strictly partisan 
lines, which I believe would have made this 
legislation more precise and also improved its 
chance for passage in the Senate. 
Simply put, I had offered an amendment 
that would have replaced the vague and im-
precise ‘‘serious human rights abuses’’ lan-
guage with the phrase ‘‘Gross violations of 
internationally-recognized 
human 
rights,’’ 
which has a long-standing, defined meeting in 
U.S. law, as codified in the Foreign Assistance 
Act, 22 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1). 
To wit, ‘‘gross violations of internationally 
recognized human rights’’ includes ‘‘torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or pun-
ishment, prolonged detention without charges 
and trial, causing the disappearance of per-
sons by the abduction and clandestine deten-
tion of those persons, and other flagrant denial 
of the right to life, liberty or the security of the 
person.’’ 
The reason this is relevant is because re-
cently, our colleagues across the aisle sought 
to import the imprecise ‘‘serious human rights 
abuses’’ language into the Global Magnitsky 
Act, and again had rejected offers to negotiate 
compromise language that would have tied 
such abuses to specific treaties the United 
States had ratified, such as the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention Against Torture. 
As a result, that held up passage of the 
Global Magnitsky Act, which otherwise had 
broad bipartisan support in the Senate, and 
caused a stalemate until the parties agreed to 
revert to the previous, precisely-defined ‘‘gross 
violations of internationally-recognized human 
rights’’ language. 
Similarly, this Georgia bill otherwise enjoys 
broad bipartisan support, but for the vague 
and imprecise formulation, which now will like-
ly have to be fixed in the Senate. 
I also note that I had tried to find a solution 
which could have kept the ‘‘serious human 
rights abuses’’ language, but would have tied 
it to abuses that were specified elsewhere in 
the legislation so as to avoid vagueness, 
namely ‘‘detentions, kidnappings, and other 
human rights violations committed in the Geor-
gian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Re-
gion/South Ossetia forcibly occupied by the 
Russian Federation including [] recent killings’ 
and similar violations of human rights.’’ 
My colleagues across the aisle, I anticipate 
will again say that we have used ‘‘serious 
human rights abuses’’ in other country- and 
region-specific legislation. Leaving aside the 
fact that that was before the recent attempted 
Global Magnitsky partisan end run, I would 
also point out that ‘‘serious human rights 
abuses’’ were tied to specific abuses specified 
in the legislation at issue. 
Thus in past legislation we called out ‘‘seri-
ous abuse or violation of human rights against 
persons associated with the protests in Nica-
ragua that began on April 18, 2018,’’ or ‘‘seri-
ous human rights abuses connected with 
forced labor’’ in Xinjiang. 
That was all that we were asking for here— 
either adopt a precise statutory definition, 
‘‘gross violations of internationally-recognized 
human rights,’’ or tie ‘‘serious human rights 
abuses’’ to what is specified in the legislation. 
But instead, we got a party line vote and a 
raw exercise of power, marring what should 
have been a unified statement of support of 
the Republic of Georgia and opposition to the 
butcher Vladimir Putin. 
I have been in Congress for over 40 years. 
I have been in the minority, and I have been 
in the majority. On bills like this, we used to 
try to find unity. 
I am sad to say that the raw exercise of po-
litical power that we have seen with regard to 
both the Global Magnitsky bill and this Geor-
gia Support Act, and the unwillingness to seek 
compromise in the face of legitimate concerns 
that 
an 
ideologically-driven 
administration 
could use vague language to pursue an agen-
da that is not shared by over half the country, 
has disappointed me. 
I am not going to oppose this bill, given the 
larger context of support for the oppressed 
people of Georgia. Majorities come, and ma-
jorities go. I wish that my colleagues across 
the aisle had been willing to compromise and 
find common ground, but they did not. 
With passage, it is on to the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 923, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
833, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H. Res. 833, 
which clearly champions Moldova’s 
push toward democracy and our com-
mon work in strengthening our bilat-
eral ties. 
I first thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative PRICE of North Carolina, 
for drafting this important measure 
and his years of work on the House De-
mocracy Partnership. 
Moldova, a small country in Europe, 
nested between Ukraine and Romania, 
rightfully 
deserves 
our 
attention 
today. After centuries of being fought 
over and by larger neighboring powers, 
the country is making strides toward 
democracy, combating deep-seated cor-
ruption, and moving closer to the 
Euro-Atlantic community. 
With 
the 
Russian 
invasion 
in 
Ukraine, the stakes are now so much 
greater. 
Indeed, 
more 
than 
400,000 
Ukrainian refugees have arrived in tiny 
Moldova since February, a number that 
represents more than 10 percent of 
Moldova’s own population. 
Furthermore, Moldova is no stranger 
to malign Russian influence and inter-
ference. 
Transnistria, 
a 
Kremlin- 
backed breakaway region in Moldova’s 
east, is an area of active risk. Moscow 
uses this wound to manipulate fears 
and politics in Moldova. We are re-
minded of that constant potential with 
the explosion in the region earlier this 
week and the constant dangerous rhet-
oric from the so-called authorities 
there. 
Thankfully, despite these challenges, 
the Moldovan Government is in a posi-
tion to tackle them and advance an 
agenda to modernize and democratize 
its society and its economy. 
President Maia Sandu and the par-
liament in Moldova are ambitiously 
fighting corruption and implementing 
needed reforms, all while strengthening 
relations with the European Union and 
with the United States. 
The Moldovan people’s good work to 
build a stronger democracy is admi-
rable and deserves our full support, es-
pecially today; and passing this resolu-
tion, coupled with the Biden adminis-
tration’s 
highlighting 
of 
Moldova’s 
progress during the Summit for De-
mocracy, sends a strong signal that the 
entire 
United 
States 
Government 
stands with them. 
This resolution looks to build on the 
momentum in this decisive moment 
from 
Moldova, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
progress is meaningful and sustainable. 
I support this resolution, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, 
Washington, DC, April 25, 2022. 
Hon. GREGORY MEEKS, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MEEKS: In recognition of 
the desire to expedite consideration of H. 
Res. 833, Expressing support for Moldova’s 
democracy, independence, and territorial in-
tegrity and strengthening United States and 
Moldova relations, the Committee on Ways 
and Means agrees to waive formal consider-
ation of the bill as to provisions that fall 
within the rule X jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. 
The Committee on Ways and Means takes 
this action with the mutual understanding 
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, and the Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as the 
bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
that we may address any remaining issues 
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also 
reserves the right to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H. Res. 833. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H. Res. 833, 
which expresses support for Moldova’s 
democracy, independence, and terri-
torial integrity and calls for strength-
ening U.S. and Moldova relations. 
Needless to say, this is an especially 
opportune time to consider this resolu-
tion; not only because this year marks 
the 30th anniversary of diplomatic re-
lations between our two countries, but 
also given the ongoing Russian aggres-
sion against Ukraine and the challenge 
it poses to other countries in the re-
gion, including Moldova. 
Moldova’s humanitarian response to 
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
and its generosity have been truly re-
markable. For example, Moldova has 
accepted nearly 434,000 Ukrainian refu-
gees. To put that into perspective, that 
is around 5 percent of Moldova’s entire 
population. 
Not only does this resolution com-
mend Moldova’s strong support for 
Ukraine, but also commits the U.S. to 
continue to assist Moldova in address-
ing the economic impacts of the crisis, 
its energy security, and advancing 
democratic reforms. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this resolution to show that 
the U.S. Congress is committed to a 
long-term partnership with Moldova. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Rep-
resentatives PRICE
and PFLUGER
for 
their work on this resolution. 
Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine is making the whole of Europe 
less secure. U.S. support for our allies 
and partners must therefore extend to 
Ukraine’s neighbors, like Moldova. 
The ominous threat made by a Rus-
sian general last week that the Krem-
lin aimed to seize a land bridge from 
the Donbas to Odesa and then to 
Transnistria, 
the 
Russian-supported 
breakaway region in Moldova, shows 
why the U.S. must pay close attention 
to Moldova and its security. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this resolution to 
demonstrate the U.S. Congress’ strong 
support of our friends in Moldova. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my 
friend for his bipartisan leadership and 
his support for this important piece of 
legislation. 
Again, combined with the Georgia 
Support Act, this resolution sends a 
clear message from this body, on a bi-
partisan basis, that we will not tol-
erate Russian aggression in Europe in 
2022. 
Combined with our solidarity in op-
position to the tragedy unfolding in 
Ukraine, it is a powerful message, 
backed up with, of course, support by 
our government, and the bipartisan na-
ture of this is just so critical. 
The people of Moldova, and the peo-
ple of Georgia, and the people of 
Ukraine, they are watching and they 
are listening, as we hope is Vladimir 
Putin and his cronies in Moscow. 
I urge support for this resolution, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 833, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
TRANSATLANTIC 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS SECURITY ACT 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3344) to prioritize the efforts of 
and 
enhance 
coordination 
among 
United States agencies to encourage 
countries in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope to improve the security of their 
telecommunications networks, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3344 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trans-
atlantic Telecommunications Security Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF 
POLICY. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) fifth and future generation’s tele-
communication networks in allied and part-
ner countries based on common, secure, 
transparent, democratic standards have the 
potential to increase cultural, political, and 
economic exchanges leading to mutual job 
creation, closer citizen relations, and strong-
er democratic institutions; 
(2) Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and il-
legal invasion of Ukraine and the People’s 
Republic of China’s tacit support for Russian 
Federation’s actions demonstrate the impor-
tance of secure telecommunication infra-
structure in Central and Eastern European 
nations; 
(3) the United States has national security 
and economic interests in assisting Central 
and Eastern European countries to improve 
the security of their telecommunication net-
works by reducing dependence on covered 
telecommunication equipment or services 
that are often offered with predatory eco-
nomic inducements and replacing them with 
secure 
telecommunication 
equipment 
or 
services; 
(4) China’s Belt and Road Initiative and 
the 17+1 Initiative seek to undermine Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe’s infrastructure re-
silience and sovereignty through predatory 
inducements from state-linked providers of 
telecommunication equipment or services 
such as Huawei Technologies Company and 
ZTE Corporation; 
(5) China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law 
obligates Chinese businesses to fully cooper-
ate with state intelligence work, and thereby 
compromises the integrity of any network 
that utilizes equipment from Chinese compa-
nies because providers could be forced to 
hand over sensitive data or shut down net-
works at the command of China; 
(6) Russia’s campaign to elect a Russian 
national, who is a former Huawei Tech-
nologies Company executive, to serve as the 
Secretary-General of the International Tele-
communication Union (ITU) is indicative of 
China and Russia’s efforts to use inter-
national organizations to promote their in-
terests and their malign influence; 
(7) at global fora such as the ITU, the 
United States Government should actively 
support candidates that espouse democratic 
values, internet freedoms, and secure tele-
communication networks; 
(8) the United States International Devel-
opment Finance Corporation’s development 
priorities, as described in section 1412 of the 
Better Utilization of Investments Leading to 
Development Act of 2018, properly includes a 
focus on less developed countries; 
(9) the United States should assemble a co-
alition of democratic and like-minded allies 
and partners to counter the rise of global 
malign actors such as China and Russia and 
build resilience in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope against malign influences; and 
(10) in order to ensure robust military co-
ordination and interoperability with the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
and transatlantic allies and partners, the 
United States should ensure that allies and

partners’ telecommunication networks are 
secure and free from potential threats in ac-
cordance with the 2019 NATO London Dec-
laration. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to strengthen the transatlantic alliance 
based on shared values in the face of rising 
malign influence from the People’s Republic 
of China and the Russian Federation, coun-
tries that seek to undermine democratic in-
stitutions and values; 
(2) to encourage public and private sector 
investment in European telecommunication 
infrastructure projects to ensure secure tele-
communication and to catalyze economic ad-
vancement through the highest standards of 
transparency, accessibility, and competition; 
(3) to provide economically feasible alter-
natives to financing from providers of cov-
ered telecommunication equipment or serv-
ices; 
(4) to engage in diplomacy with European 
allies and partners to strengthen the United 
States and European private sector efforts to 
develop common telecommunication tech-
nology and industry standards, and in turn 
promote them globally; 
(5) to support the Three Seas Initiative or-
ganized by 12 Central and Eastern European 
countries of the European Union to increase 
infrastructure resiliency and reduce reliance 
on malign actors, including in the tele-
communication space; 
(6) to enhance telecommunication security 
and freedom around the globe by engaging in 
elections at the ITU and promoting the can-
didacies of individuals that will promote 
democratic values, the rule of law, techno-
logical freedoms, and telecommunication se-
curity; 
(7) to support the people of Ukraine, 
Moldova, Georgia, and the Western Balkan 
countries in their desire for integration into 
Euro-Atlantic institutions and economies 
through enhanced cross-border telecommuni-
cation infrastructure connectivity; and 
(8) to ensure that frontline NATO allies 
have telecommunication services that can-
not be controlled by China or Russia, espe-
cially considering Russia’s illegal and un-
justifiable invasion of Ukraine.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3344, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3344, as amended, the Trans-
atlantic Telecommunications Security 
Act. 
Let me start by thanking Represent-
ative MARCY
KAPTUR
of Ohio, the 
chairwoman of the Ukraine Caucus 
here in Congress. She has been an in-
credible leader and a very important 
voice for Ukraine, not just these past 2 
months, but for decades as a Member of 
Congress. This bill is part and parcel of 
her many efforts to aid the people of 
Ukraine and Eastern Europe. 
I emphasize a key point throughout 
my 
remarks 
today: 
Telecommuni-
cation security is a central pillar of na-
tional security. 
If a hostile power has the ability to 
shut down a country’s access to the 
internet, 
then 
both 
telecommuni-
cations and national security have, in 
fact, been breached. 
If a strategic competitor can disable 
telecoms gear or cut an underseas 
cable to turn off a country’s mobile 
network, 
then 
both 
telecommuni-
cations and national security have, in 
fact, been breached. 
And if foreign rivals can snoop on a 
country’s calls and steal classified in-
formation because they can access the 
network, 
then 
both 
telecommuni-
cations and national security have, in 
fact, been breached. 
The lesson is clear: The United 
States and its allies cannot rely on 
telecoms gear produced and supplied by 
countries and companies close to the 
People’s Republic of China government 
or the Putin regime in Moscow. This is 
especially true in Eastern Europe, as 
President Putin has decided to act on 
violent imperial hubris rather than re-
spect the law of nations. 
If the problem is PRC-affiliated tech-
nology and Russian aggression, then 
the Transatlantic Telecommunications 
Security Act is a key part in the solu-
tion to bolster our national security 
and that of our friends and allies. 
First and foremost, the bill allows 
the Development Finance Corporation 
to fund telecom security projects to en-
sure that all network gear in Eastern 
Europe is safe. As Ukraine faces the 
immediate threat to its national secu-
rity, projects in the region must and 
will receive priority assistance. 
Second, this bill authorizes the State 
Department to create a new position of 
campaign coordinator at the Depart-
ment to focus on upcoming elections in 
the U.N. body called the International 
Telecommunications Union. That elec-
tion comprises of an American with 
significant experience with the ITU 
and a Russian who previously worked 
for the Chinese company, Huawei. 
What could go wrong with that? 
This is an election the free world can 
ill afford to lose, and we must do every-
thing in our power to ensure corrupt 
actors are kept from its power. This in-
cludes a whole-of-government response, 
such as the State Department working 
with Commerce and the FCC, as well as 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
teaming up with our good friends on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
to make sure the ITU promotes free 
and secure telecom systems around the 
globe. 
b 1400 
The TTSA is a critical bill that 
would deliver tangible security bene-
fits for Ukraine and frontline NATO al-
lies. We can, should, and must get this 
bill to the President’s desk quickly. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to make that reality one step 
closer by voting for this legislation 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this bipartisan bill, the Trans-
atlantic Telecommunications Security 
Act. This legislation authorizes the 
U.S. Development Finance Corporation 
to provide financing for secure 5G and 
future generations telecommunications 
infrastructure development projects in 
select Central and Eastern European 
countries 
with 
upper-middle-income 
economies or high-income economies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4541 
April 27, 2022 
This authorization aims to push back 
against CCP efforts to dominate the 5G 
and future generations telecommuni-
cations networks of our strategic allies 
and partners in the region, many of 
whom are NATO allies. 
Ensuring the security of the tele-
communications network of our NATO 
allies and partners in Central and East-
ern Europe is unquestionably in the 
U.S. national security interest. 
Moreover, this bill targets the major-
ity of countries in the Three Seas Ini-
tiative. Launched by 12 of our close 
friends in Central and Eastern Europe, 
the Three Seas Initiative seeks to ex-
pand cross-border energy, transpor-
tation, and digital infrastructure, as 
well as boost economic development in 
the region. Though it is a regional ini-
tiative, it has global implications that 
serve not only European but U.S. secu-
rity and economic interests. 
We in Congress have expressed great 
concern that CCP is exporting corrup-
tion, debt traps, and poor labor and en-
vironmental standards to Europe and 
across the world through its 17+1 and 
Belt and Road initiatives. The Three 
Seas Initiative seeks to address these 
concerns by providing positive alter-
natives to PRC investments in the re-
gion, including in its 5G and future 
telecom networks. 
The last administration successfully 
convinced most of Central and Eastern 
Europe to opt not to use high-risk Chi-
nese suppliers in their telecommuni-
cations 
networks. 
Supporting 
the 
Three Seas Initiative’s efforts to ex-
pand secure digital infrastructure in 
Central and Eastern Europe will carry 
forward this major foreign policy suc-
cess and ensures the transatlantic com-
munity remains united in its clear- 
eyed assessment of the threat the CCP 
poses to telecommunications security. 
In addition, Russia’s full-scale inva-
sion of Ukraine must serve as a wake- 
up call to the dangers of allowing our 
adversaries to expand their influence in 
critical sectors of our economies. In 
particular, Europe’s energy dependence 
on Russia has made it difficult to rally 
the continent around tougher sanc-
tions and is funding the Kremlin’s war 
machine to the tune of about $1 billion 
every day. This is not in Europe’s or 
the United States’ national security in-
terests. 
We cannot wait for a potential con-
flict over Taiwan to assist our closest 
allies and partners in Europe and be-
yond in cutting out the CCP’s malign 
influence now that it has been used to 
gain leverage over our democratic al-
lies. This bill would help ensure we 
learn from our collective past mis-
takes. 
Lastly, this bill is important because 
it directs the Secretary of State to ap-
point a campaign director among exist-
ing personnel for the upcoming elec-
tion 
at 
the 
International 
Tele-
communications Union, the ITU, which 
sets global standards for technologies 
such as 5G. 
Russia’s campaign to elect a Russian 
national who is a former Huawei execu-
tive to serve as the secretary general of 
the ITU is indicative of Russia’s and 
China’s efforts to use international or-
ganizations to promote their interests 
and malign influence. 
The United States should ensure that 
we are coordinated in driving support 
for the U.S. candidate, Doreen Bogdan- 
Martin, for the secretary general of the 
ITU, but the State Department should 
also engage on the important down-bal-
lot races at the ITU. 
There are four other posts of signifi-
cance within the ITU’s leadership 
structure, including the director of the 
ITU Development Sector, the ITU-D. 
The ITU-D plays a particularly vital 
role in supporting multilateral co-
operation for fair and open internet 
governance through trustworthy de-
ployment of digital technologies in the 
developing world. 
The U.S. must be doing everything 
we can to ensure Russian and Chinese 
malign influence does not grow. This 
bill would help. 
The Three Seas Initiative seeks to 
address threats posed by the CCP by 
providing positive alternatives to PRC 
investments in the region, including in 
its 5G and future telecoms networks. 
We must support our allies in Central 
and Eastern Europe as they seek, 
through the Three Seas Initiative, to 
reduce their dependence on Moscow’s 
and Beijing’s economic overtures. Only 
together can we face the threats posed 
by the authoritarian regimes in China 
and Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, again, 
I thank my friend for his leadership 
and bipartisanship on this critical 
piece of legislation. I think it is time-
ly. I think it is urgent. I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3344, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
COUNTERING MALIGN RUSSIAN 
ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA ACT 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7311) to direct the Secretary of

In this Act, the term ‘‘appropriate congres-
sional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCEACHIN). Pursuant to the rule, the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER) each will con-
trol 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7311, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7311, the Countering Malign 
Russian Activities in Africa Act, as 
amended, introduced by Representative 
GREGORY
MEEKS, 
chairman 
of 
the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
As Putin pursues a violent, illegal, 
and unjustifiable war in the sovereign 
nation of Ukraine, we must remember 
that he is also destabilizing fragile 
states in Africa to feed his ruthless war 
machine. 
As a matter of fact, the Russian Fed-
eration has conducted malign activi-
ties throughout Africa for several 
years now to raise funds and evade 
sanctions that would inevitably result 
from Putin’s brutal war. 
From 
troll 
farms 
that 
spread 
disinformation to unaccountable pri-
vate military contractors, the Kremlin 
continues to destabilize parts of Africa 
in order to achieve its objectives re-
gardless of consequences. 
Those consequences are deadly and 
draining African governments of sorely 
needed resources. For example, Putin 
has used his network of oligarchs to de-
ploy the Wagner Group mercenaries to 
countries like Mali and the Central Af-
rican Republic, where allegations of 
human rights abuses such as mass exe-
cutions, forced disappearances, torture, 
and other unspeakable acts are mount-
ing every day by those groups. 
That is why I call on my colleagues 
to support H.R. 7311, which would re-
quire the Secretary of State to submit 
to Congress a strategy and plan out-
lining U.S. efforts to counter Russia’s 
malign activities on the continent of 
Africa that undermine U.S. interests. 
It would also require the State De-
partment to identify and hold account-
able Russian and African officials who 
facilitate Russia’s malign activities, 
including those that exploit the con-
tinent’s natural resources and manipu-
late democratic processes in order to 
evade sanctions. 
I am pleased to see the administra-
tion is taking several steps toward this 
end in recent days, including through 
designating several Russian companies 
involved in illicit activities in Africa 
that were, in essence, designed to evade 
sanctions. 
With H.R. 7311, I am confident the 
State Department, with the support of 
our other Federal agencies, will help 
Congress develop a clear picture of 
what Putin is, in fact, doing in Africa 
and how we can effectively push back 
to protect our interests and those of 
our partners throughout the African 
region. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and 
urge my colleagues to do the same. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7311 to require the State Department 
to develop a strategy to counter Rus-
sian malign influence in Africa. 
As the world continues to watch Rus-
sia commit unspeakable atrocities and 
war crimes in Ukraine, the U.S. and 
our allies and partners must fully as-
sess the threat posed by Russian activi-
ties around the world. 
This bill requires the State Depart-
ment to assess the threat of Russia’s 
engagement in Africa and create a plan 
to counter the Russian Federation’s 
growing influence on the continent. In 
particular, the bill requires a specific 
focus on extractive industries, security 
assistance, and strategic basing agree-
ments. 
In Sudan, Russia is pursuing an 
agreement to establish a military base 
on the Red Sea. Russian mercenaries 
are also active in the Central African 
Republic, Mali, and Libya. While they 
claim to support stabilization efforts, 
in reality, they are committing gross 
violations of human rights and exploit-
ing natural resources. 
Just last month, Russian merce-
naries were implicated in a massacre of 
over 200 people in Mali. This was the 
worst attack in Mali in over 10 years. 
Further reports indicate that they at-
tempted to blame the atrocities on 
French forces after French intelligence 
footage showed Russian mercenaries 
burying victims’ bodies outside of a 
former French military base. 
Putin’s complicity in these atrocities 
and war crimes around the world, and 
disinformation campaigns to avoid ac-
countability, cannot go unanswered. I 
strongly condemn these attacks and 
the destabilizing role of Russia across 
the continent and the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Chairman MEEKS and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, as well as Chairwoman BASS 
and Ranking Member SMITH
on the 
Subcommittee 
for 
Africa, 
Global 
Health, and Global Human Rights, for 
offering this important measure. 
The assessment and strategy re-
quired by the bill is an important first 
step, but the U.S. must do more to 
counter Russian malign activity wher-
ever it is present, and the atrocities 
and war crimes ongoing in Ukraine fur-
ther underscore the urgency. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
again to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend again for his leader-
ship and bipartisanship on this bill. I 
think it is a very important bill be-
cause Russia is spreading its malign in-
fluence all over the world, and it is 
having a particular impact in the Afri-
can continent, so we need to be pre-
pared. We need to respond. This bill 
will help do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important piece of legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to speak in support of Chairman MEEKS’ 
Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa 
Act, of which I am an original cosponsor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4543 
April 27, 2022 
While so much of the world’s attention is 
rightfully focused on Russia’s atrocities in 
Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and his minions are 
also at work elsewhere around the world. 
This is especially true in Africa, where we 
see the extensive presence of Russian Private 
Military Contractors, or PMCs, in particular the 
notorious Wagner Group, and extensive Rus-
sian entanglement in countries with mining 
and strategic mineral reserves. 
In some cases, such as in the Central Afri-
can Republic, we see mines guarded by Wag-
ner Group mercenaries. Wagner Group PMCs 
are said to have also appeared recently in 
Sudan, where there had been earlier reports 
of Russia seeking a naval base. 
We have also seen Wagner mercenaries 
implicated in atrocities in Mali, which seems to 
have taken a bizarre turn recently, with France 
accusing Russia of staging a false flag oper-
ation seeking to implicate the French. 
Thus, the Chairman’s bill is especially time-
ly, and can serve as a template for other bills 
addressing Russian involvement around the 
world, including the Western Hemisphere, as 
came up during our markup. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7311, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4133. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4133, the Caribbean Basin Secu-
rity Initiative Authorization Act of 
2022. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative ESPAILLAT, for drafting 
this important measure. 
CBSI has been essential in helping 
our partners in the Caribbean improve 
their capacity to combat transnational 
crime, violence, and regional insta-
bility while also enhancing our own se-
curity and strengthening our critical 
partnerships in the region. 
By supporting a multiyear authoriza-
tion, we can effectively assist our Car-
ibbean partners in citizen safety, secu-
rity, and the rule of law in the Carib-
bean Basin; reducing corruption and 
the malign influence of authoritarian 
regimes like Xi Jinping’s China and 
Vladimir Putin’s Russia; and strength-
ening the ability of countries in the re-
gion to prepare for and respond to nat-
ural disasters. 
According to a status report from the 
State Department’s U.S. Strategy for 
Engagement in the Caribbean released 
in July of 2019 is says: ‘‘Rising crime 
and endemic corruption threaten gov-
ernments’ ability to provide security 
and good governance’’ in many of the 
nations in the region. 
With ongoing efforts to mitigate 
transnational organized crime in Cen-
tral America and Mexico, the drug 
trade and in other illegal activities 
likely will move further into the Carib-
bean, particularly as the regional eco-
nomic outlook deteriorates due to the 
continuing economic impacts of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Given the tragic impacts of the re-
cent hurricane season in the Caribbean 
and trends pointing toward more fre-
quent and intense natural disasters, 
this renewed support for CBSI can also 
help make it possible for our friends in 
the region to become more climate re-
silient by building robust rapid-re-
sponse mechanisms and resilient infra-
structure responses throughout the re-
gion. 
The support from CBSI can help to 
avoid a climate of fear and uncertainty 
among citizens that leads to dimin-
ished economic growth. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and 
urge my colleagues to do the same, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, narcotics trafficking 
and illicit money from the Caribbean is 
fueling America’s drug crisis and is de-
stabilizing the Western Hemisphere. 
The same groups that traffic narcotics, 
weapons, and humans also spread mis-
ery throughout the region and into the 
U.S. homeland. 
At the same time, malign actors like 
the Chinese Communist Party spread 
their web of influence in the region. 
This problem is especially troubling 
since the Caribbean is home to a large 
concentration of Taiwan’s diplomatic 
allies. 
As evidenced by Nicaragua’s recent 
decision to sever long-standing ties 
with Taiwan, the CCP is employing a 
range of tools to advance its malign 
agenda in the Caribbean and through-
out Latin America. 
Congress must remain committed to 
working with our allies to address 
shared security threats, cooperating on 
regional challenges, and promoting 
democratic governance. That is why I 
am supporting the Caribbean Basin Se-
curity Initiative Authorization Act. 
As the CCP exerts its malign influ-
ence and drugs flow into the United 
States, now is the time to work with 
our allies in the region to ensure our 
national security interests are pro-
tected. 
This legislation will expand our Car-
ibbean partners’ ability to surveil il-
licit actors in the water and in the air, 
improve local law enforcement’s abil-
ity to intercept narcotics trafficking, 
strengthen local criminal justice insti-
tutions, and support natural disaster 
response efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), my good friend 
and author of this legislation. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
this opportunity to speak about H.R. 
4133, the Caribbean Basin Security Ini-
tiative. 
For more than 10 years, Mr. Speaker, 
Congress has supported funding CBSI, 
appropriating during that time $831 
million, and supporting 13 Caribbean 
nations. 
H.R. 4133, the Caribbean Basin Secu-
rity Initiative Authorization Act will 
authorize appropriations of $75 million 
each year from 2022 to 2026. It also re-
quires the Department of State to de-
velop a strategy to improve disaster re-
silience in the Caribbean—and to re-
port progress made under the initia-
tive. 
We all know how the Caribbean 
stands in the pathway of hurricanes 
and other natural disasters. As such, 
they must really improve disaster re-
siliency in those island nations. CBSI 
supports our allies in the Caribbean by 
promoting citizen safety, citizen secu-
rity, and adhering to the rule of law. It 
also reduces trafficking in narcotics. It 
will help us interdict narcotics in the 
Caribbean region, which is the third 
border of our country. 
It also reduces corruption and the 
malign influence of foreign adversaries 
in the region. We all know how foreign 
adversaries are looking to ill-invest in 
that region and circumvent, in many 
cases, 
transparency 
measures. 
It 
strengthens the ability to respond, as I 
said earlier, Mr. Speaker, to natural 
disasters. It is so important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4545 
April 27, 2022 
These island nations are in jeopardy. 
They are in serious trouble with hurri-
canes and rising sea levels and other 
natural disasters. You better than any-
body, Mr. Speaker, know about this. 
This Caribbean Basin Security Initia-
tive would also provide funding for 
that. 
By empowering our neighbors in the 
Caribbean, we will in turn bolster the 
national security of the United States. 
Our allies in the Caribbean are facing 
many, many challenges brought about 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, strained 
global supply chains, and increased en-
ergy costs. That seems to be a common 
problem in island nations: increased 
energy costs. As such, they are really 
up for grabs by some of our adversaries 
who often take advantage in a crisis. 
We must do more to really help out our 
neighbors, our allies in that region. 
We must continue funding for CBSI. 
It is critical to help Caribbean nations 
strengthen their economies, and in 
turn, strengthen our very own. 
It is especially important that we 
continue our engagement in the Carib-
bean as our foreign adversaries at-
tempt 
to 
spread 
their 
influence 
throughout the region. A safe and pros-
perous Caribbean region is in the 
United States’ national security inter-
ests. 
As we prepare to host the ninth Sum-
mit of the Americas in California in 
June, I urge my colleagues to support 
CBSI and reaffirm our commitment to 
enhancing U.S.-Caribbean relations. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. 
and our partners must seriously con-
front the growing threat posed by the 
CCP in the Caribbean and beyond. 
As the situation at our border gets 
worse, deadly drugs like fentanyl are 
surging across our southern border 
from illicit actors in Latin America. 
We must address the issue imme-
diately. We cannot ignore the Carib-
bean, America’s third border. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ESPAILLAT, 
Mr. MEEKS, Mr. SIRES, Mr. GREEN, and 
Mr. CONNOLLY for leading this measure. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend for his leadership and 
bipartisanship on this important bill. I 
really can’t add to the eloquence of our 
friend and colleague from New York 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important and critical 
piece of legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the

(H.R. 6089) to clarify that section 107 of 
the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act applies sanc-
tions with respect to unmanned com-

viding additional clarity to the United 
Nations 
Register 
of 
Conventional 
Arms, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Drones Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) A July 15, 2013, United Nations General 
Assembly Report on the continuing oper-
ation of the United Nations Register of Con-
ventional Arms and its further development 
(document A/68/140) states in paragraph 45, 
‘‘The Group noted the discussion of the 2006 
Group that category IV already covered 
armed unmanned aerial vehicles and of the 
2009 Group on a proposal to include a new 
category for such vehicles. The Group re-
viewed proposals for providing greater clar-
ity to category IV.’’. 
(2) Section 107 of the Countering America’s 
Adversaries 
Through 
Sanctions 
Act 
(22 
U.S.C. 9406), enacted August 2, 2017, requires 
the President to impose sanctions on any 
person that the President determines ‘‘know-
ingly engages in any activity that materi-
ally contributes to the supply, sale, or trans-
fer directly or indirectly to or from Iran, or 
for the use in or benefit of Iran, of any battle 
tanks, armored combat vehicles, large cal-
iber artillery systems, combat aircraft, at-
tack helicopters, warships, missiles or mis-
sile systems, as defined for the purpose of 
the United Nations Register of Conventional 
Arms, or related materiel, including spare 
parts’’. 
(3) In 2019, the United Nations formally 
changed the heading of category IV of the 
United Nations Register of Conventional 
Arms to ‘‘combat aircraft and unmanned 
combat aerial vehicles’’. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It shall be the policy of the United States 
to prevent Iran and Iranian-aligned terrorist

aerial 
vehicles, 
including 
commercially 
available component parts, that can be used 
in attacks against United States persons and 
partner nations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4546 
April 27, 2022 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6089. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6089, the Stop Iranian Drones 
Act, which was introduced by Ranking 
Member MCCAUL and Chairman MEEKS, 
along with Congressmen DEUTCH and 
WILSON, chair and ranking member of 
the Middle East, North Africa, and 
Global 
Counterterrorism 
Sub-
committee. 
As we have seen in recent months, 
Iran and Iranian-aligned terrorists and 
militia groups have been growing in-
creasingly aggressive with their drone 
attacks throughout the Middle East— 
targeting U.S. troops, commercial ves-
sels, partner countries, and more. 
Not long ago, an Iranian-sponsored 
militia in Yemen utilized drones to 
cause death and destruction in the 
UAE, hundreds of miles away. Simi-
larly, Saudi Arabia has faced repeated 
drone attacks on its civilian areas and 
its critical infrastructure. 
This bill clarifies that existing con-
ventional weapons sanctions against 
Iran include unmanned combat aerial 
vehicles and brings U.S. code up to 
date with the United Nation’s cat-
egories of major conventional arms. 
By doing this, this bill will allow the 
United States to better respond to the 
threat posed by Iran and its proxies’ 
aggressive UAV tactics with respect to 
the United States and its partners. 
This is not a new sanction, but rather 
a clarification of current law. It will in 
no way interfere with the ongoing nu-
clear talks. We have confirmed this 
with the State Department. 
The Biden administration is taking 
this threat seriously. They have sanc-
tioned the top Iranian military official 
for his role in the July attack on a 
commercial shipping vessel in the Gulf 
of Oman, in addition to blacklisting a 
network of individuals and companies 
behind Iran’s UAV program. 
b 1430 
But we can do more, and we need our 
allies to do more as well. The clarifica-
tion included in this legislation will 
help show the international commu-
nity that Iranian UAV proliferation 
will not be tolerated by this govern-
ment or this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for full support of 
this House in passing this legislation 
so we can move it one step closer to 
the President’s desk, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

Washington, DC, April 21, 2022. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Committee on the Judiciary,

Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Iran and its proxies continue to 
threaten U.S. troops and our partners 
throughout 
the 
Middle 
East 
with 
drones. Iran-backed militia groups at-
tacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria 
with UAVs throughout 2021. Houthi at-
tacks on Saudi Arabia doubled over the 
first 9 months of 2021 compared to 2020, 
which included frequent UAV assaults. 
Where do the Houthis get most of 
their dangerous UAV technology? Iran. 
And Iran continues to use UAVs to 
threaten Israel, including in its deadly 
attack on an Israeli-owned tanker last 
summer. This is exactly why I am op-
posed to striking another bad nuclear 
deal with Iran that would line the re-
gime’s pockets with cash. We need to 
be constraining Iran’s resources, not 
filling its coffers. The more money Iran 
has, the more it will spend on threats 
to the U.S. and our partners. Period. 
This situation is intolerable. The 
people of the Middle East, including 
Americans living there, cannot live in 
freedom, stability, or prosperity under 
assault by Iran’s drones. We have to 
limit Iran’s ability to build and supply 
drones. 
This crucial legislation will take the 
necessary steps to help reduce the 
threats of Iranian drones. It clarifies 
that our existing sanctions on Iran’s 
conventional weapons program include 
the supply, sale, or transfer to or from 
Iran of combat UAVs. And it codifies 
that it is U.S. policy to prevent Iran 
and its proxies from acquiring UAVs 
that can be used in attacks against the 
U.S. and our partners. 
With this legislation, Congress is 
telling the world that the U.S. will use 
every tool to cut off Iran’s UAV sup-
plies and that we will punish those who 
continue to supply Iran with UAVs and 
parts despite their destructive impact. 
Iran has long demonstrated its com-
mitment to destabilizing the Middle 
East with its malign activities, but we 
are committed to countering Iran’s at-
tacks and keeping our partners safe. 
We will continue to adapt to this UAV 
threat. That includes robust sanctions 
enforcement against Iran’s UAV pro-
gram and proliferation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) who serves on 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 6089, the Stop 
Iranian Drones Act, and to speak favor-
ably about all of the important legisla-
tion the House is moving today to ad-
dress 
Russia’s 
illegal 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
The Stop Iranian Drones Act codifies 
crucial language that ensures we can 
impose sanctions on Iranian drones 
under current laws. Sanctions are a 
very powerful tool, as we have seen in 
the last 2 months as we have imposed 
powerful sanctions on Russia since its 
invasion, but I think we need to go fur-
ther, and my bill, H.R. 6930, the Asset 
Seizure for Ukrainian Reconstruction 
Act, gives us the tools to do just that. 
Let me say a few words about it. 
In the last few weeks, we have seen 
across the United States, Europe, and 
the world the seizure of yachts, villas, 
and banks accounts belonging to Rus-
sian oligarchs who have supported the 
cruel regime of Vladimir Putin. Re-
cently, with the help of the FBI, a $90-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4547 
April 27, 2022 
million yacht was seized in Europe. 
Ninety million dollars is actually pret-
ty cheap for a Russian oligarch’s 
yacht. Some of these boats run up to 
$600 million. Up to $300 billion of Rus-
sian Central Bank assets have been 
seized or frozen by the United States 
and our allies. 
All these actions raise a very impor-
tant question. Think about the de-
struction in Ukraine, the thousands of 
people who have been killed, the atroc-
ities, and the bodies of men and women 
left in the streets as Russian soldiers 
and occupiers are expelled by the brave 
Ukrainian defenders. 
Can we imagine if there is, for exam-
ple, a cease-fire that puts the imme-
diate violence to rest—we hope that 
happens—but can we imagine at that 
moment giving all of this wealth, all of 
Russia’s wealth, the yachts, the bank 
accounts, the villas, and the planes 
back to Putin and his cronies as 
Ukraine lies in ruin and as the Ukrain-
ians bury their dead? 
I think the answer is no. We cannot 
imagine doing that. We will not do 
that. I don’t believe that the Biden ad-
ministration intends to do that. But 
the law here is very complicated. These 
assets are not actually seized. They are 
merely frozen and blocked. 
So this legislation—which I urge all 
of my colleagues to support today, a bi-
partisan bill—asks the administration 
to come up with a mechanism that 
would enable us to take this wealth 
and to sell it, to dispose of it, and to 
use the proceeds to help the people and 
Government of Ukraine rebuild their 
country. 
Yes, it is complicated. If we apply 
our American legal constructs to these 
men and women who have served Putin 
loyally all these years, it looks like 
they are the owners of these assets. 
One of them owns the Chelsea football 
team in Great Britain. Some own prop-
erty in the United States. But, in fact, 
Mr. Speaker, if you understand how 
Russia works, then you understand 
that the true owner of all of these as-
sets is one man. It is Putin. These are 
pooled assets. He can use them when-
ever he wants. 
So I believe it is fitting that we 
should pass legislation encouraging the 
administration to use the wealth that 
has supported this cruel regime to help 
to rebuild the country that the Putin 
regime is destroying. 
It is the right thing to do, and it is 
the practical thing to do because this 
reconstruction effort will, in fact, cost 
up to hundreds of billions of dollars. 
We should not be saddled with the full 
cost of that. Let’s use Russia’s money 
to rebuild Ukraine. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
think this is an important piece of leg-
islation in trying to contain the ma-
lign activities of the Iranian Govern-
ment especially in a critical region, 
critical to us and critical to the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. 
In closing, Iran is a state sponsor of 
terrorism that oppresses its own people 
and poses a grave threat to the U.S. 
and our allies in the Middle East, and 
the Iranian regime is using drones to 
expand that threat. Just last month re-
tiring CENTCOM Commander General 
McKenzie told Congress that he was 
very concerned about the remarkable 
growth in number and efficiency of 
Iran’s UAV program and long-range 
drones. We have a responsibility to our 
men and women in uniform to do ev-
erything we can to counter Iran’s dan-
gerous UAVs. 
I am pleased we are taking this step 
today to clarify our sanctions laws and 
make it clear that they cover Iran’s 
drones. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we 
can continue the long history of bipar-
tisan cooperation to respond to Iran’s 
threats, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6089, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members

vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4693. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4693, the Global Malnutrition 
Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021. 
In the wake of COVID–19, we have 
seen malnutrition rates climb and food 
insecurity 
become 
an 
ever-greater 
challenge. Jarringly, it is predicted 
that disruptions to global food and 
health systems will double global mal-
nutrition rates—double—with women 
and children bearing the brunt of those 
effects. It is estimated that in 2022 the 
devastating global effects of COVID–19 
could add an additional 17 million se-
verely malnourished children world-
wide. We cannot stand by while mil-
lions of children’s lives are on the line 
with COVID, climate change, and con-
flict worsening the global situation. 
That is why the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee took action with H.R. 4693 
which will direct USAID to implement 
solutions to prevent and treat this 
global malnutrition. 
This bill establishes a nutrition lead-
ership council to identify populations 
most at risk to severe malnutrition 
and to prioritize prevention and treat-
ment programs. Preventing and treat-
ing malnutrition is relatively inexpen-
sive to implement and has high re-
turns. With every $1 we spend, we im-
prove health and increase cognitive

and physical development yielding the 
equivalent of a $35 return. 
By coordinating activities through-
out the U.S. Government with our 
partner countries with the Untied Na-
tions’ specialized agencies, civil soci-
ety, private-sector actors and more, we 
can sustain nutrition interventions 
that save lives. 
This bill also requires USAID to pro-
vide Congress an implementation plan 
and annual reports concerning its pro-
grams for treating and preventing mal-
nutrition. 
Mr. Speaker, we must do more to 
support those in dire need, and we 
must answer their call for help. H.R. 
4693 is this Chamber’s opportunity to 
do just that: to prevent the lives of 
those suffering from malnutrition all 
around the world. This measure builds 
on the work and jurisdiction of USAID 
and will bolster efforts to respond to 
and prevent malnutrition everywhere. 
While the United States has led the 
world in responding to COVID–19 and 
its effects around the world, we must 
also ensure we don’t lose ground in 
longstanding investments such as food 
security. By supporting this legislation 
we can take a meaningful step in doing 
both. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure so we can move it 
one step closer to the President’s desk, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as we speak, millions of 
women and children are on the brink of 
starvation around the world. An esti-
mated 3.1 million children perish every 
year due to malnutrition. In fact, al-
most half of the deaths among children 
under the age of 5 are linked to mal-
nutrition, mainly in low- and middle- 
income countries. In the 21st century 
this tragedy should be prevented. 
This bipartisan bill will support ef-
forts to scale up targeted and effective 
nutrition programs in countries most 
at risk for severe malnutrition. That 
will help us have a real impact on peo-
ple’s lives around the world. 
Fallout from the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine and the administration’s cha-
otic and deadly withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan have compounded global hu-
manitarian crises. Coupled with the 
COVID–19 pandemic, now more than 
ever we must do everything we can to 
advance lifesaving nutrition programs, 
and that starts with a strong and effec-
tive USAID who has the tools it needs 
to ensure no child dies from malnutri-
tion. 
Every parent wants to be able to put 
food on the table, nourish their fami-
lies, and provide for themselves. Sup-
port for low-cost, effective nutrition 
interventions mean an investment in 
the health, development, and produc-
tivity of the next generation of chil-
dren, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important measure. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, in addition 
to the crises in Ukraine, Afghanistan, 
and Ethiopia, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has erased years of progress towards 
ending extreme poverty. It has pushed 
more people into severe food insecurity 
and malnutrition and has destabilized 
fragile states. This legislation will help 
us reclaim lost ground in the battle 
against hunger and malnutrition. 
USAID plays a pivotal role in helping 
nations across the globe combat hun-
ger and poverty. The agency, alongside 
our NGO and private-sector partners, 
has helped secure nutrition stability 
for expectant mothers and young chil-
dren along with countless others in 
need, but more must be done to truly 
end starvation. 
I want to thank members of the ad-
vocacy community, especially Bread 
for the World and RESULTS, for their 
continued support of this legislative ef-
fort. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful we can 
continue the long history of bipartisan 
cooperation to help those in need 
around the world, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
b 1445 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The United States has a long tradi-
tion, on a bipartisan basis, of dealing 
with the issue of food insecurity and 
malnutrition. Herbert Hoover led some 
of the early efforts by the United 
States Government after World War I 
to feed a starving Europe. He even pro-
vided food assistance to the Bolshevik 
regime in Russia because we under-
stood that malnutrition didn’t respect 
political ideology or labels. 
Through the Food for Peace program 
in the early Kennedy and Johnson 
years, there was cooperation between 
the late Senator Bob Dole and the late 
Senator George McGovern to make 
sure that both domestic and inter-
national food security were staples of 
U.S. policy and bipartisan support. 
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion. No child in 2022 should ever be 
malnourished, and certainly, no child 
should ever die from malnourishment. 
This is an important statement by 
this Congress about our values as 
human beings and as a society and re-
affirms a longstanding commitment by 
the American people to not let this 
kind of tragedy happen anywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4693, Global Malnutri-
tion Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021, 
which will establish programs and direct the 
U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID) to carry out activities to prevent and 
treat malnutrition globally. 
This bill would advance targeted and evi-
dence-based interventions for the prevention 
and treatment of global malnutrition and to im-
prove the coordination of such programs. 
Under this bill, USAID must leverage re-
sources to address malnutrition through the 
Global Nutrition Coordination Plan and its role 
on the board of directors of the International 
Development of Finance Corporation. 
The Global Nutrition Coordination plan is an 
interagency effort to strengthen the impact of 
U.S. investments in nutrition. 
USAID must also select countries based on 
specific malnutrition-related indicators for the 
purpose of targeting malnutrition prevention 
and treatment programs. 
The plan will prioritize high-need, under-
served, marginalized or impoverished commu-
nities. 
However, countries must display strong po-
litical commitment and have existing nutrition 
strategies already in place, which ensures that 
the plan to combat malnutrition in a select 
country will be effective and impactful. 
Additionally, USAID may: 
establish the Nutrition Leadership Council to 
coordinate activities to prevent and treat mal-
nutrition; 
target resources and nutrition interventions 
to the populations most susceptible to severe 
malnutrition, and otherwise support efforts to 
prevent and treat malnutrition globally; 
coordinate activities among partner coun-
tries, United Nations agencies, civil society, 
private sector actors, and others to, for exam-
ple, build capacity in partner countries to sus-
tain nutrition interventions. 
USAID would also be required to provide 
Congress with an implementation plan and an-
nual reports concerning the programs for treat-
ing and preventing malnutrition. 
As a senior Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the founding chair of the 
Congressional Children’s Caucus, I believe 
this bill is vital for preventing and treating mal-
nutrition around the world. 
We must ensure continued focus on multi- 
sectoral nutrition programs, while monitoring 
these interventions to ensure effective use of 
American taxpayer dollars. 
I commend the USAID maternal and child 
nutrition programs that seek to improve health 
outcomes by implementing nutrition-specific 
interventions, and those that address the im-
mediate, health-related determinants of under-
nutrition. 
It is no secret that poverty amplifies the risk 
of malnutrition. 
People who are poor are more likely to be 
affected by different forms of malnutrition. 
Furthermore, malnutrition increases health 
care costs, reduces productivity, and slows 
economic growth, which can perpetuate a 
cycle of poverty and ill-health. 
Malnutrition can have several negative and 
deadly effects such as decreased cognitive 
development in newborns, greater vulnerability 
to disease and other issues. 
Optimizing nutrition early in life, especially 
from the 1,000 days from conception to a 
child’s second birthday ensures the best pos-
sible start in life, with long-term benefits. 
According to UNICEF, nearly half of all 
deaths in children under 5 are attributable to 
undernutrition. 
Every year, the world loses hundreds of 
thousands of young children and babies to 
hunger-related causes. 
Women, infants, children, and adolescents 
are at particular risk of malnutrition. 
I would be remiss if I stood here today with-
out addressing the global impact of COVID–19 
on malnutrition. 
The significant and life-altering shocks cre-
ated by the pandemic and efforts to mitigate 
the transmission of COVID–19 have resulted 
in the disruption of food systems.

April 27, 2022 
This has also upended health and nutrition 
services which has devastated livelihoods, as 
well as threatened food security. 
These necessary containment measures 
have unfortunately caused more vulnerable 
children to face malnourishment. 
By the end of this year nearly 14 million 
more children are likely to be severely mal-
nourished because of the pandemic’s impacts. 
This means that 58.9 million young chil-
dren—or almost the whole population of South 
Africa—will likely face life-threatening malnutri-
tion if the global community doesn’t act. 
The pandemic revealed the already existing 
brutal food insecurity struggles in many na-
tions while triggering economic recessions and 
jeopardizing access to food. 
The combined impacts of environmental fac-
tors, COVID–19 and political conflicts place 
malnutrition as an overwhelming concern in 
the global community. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 4693 because with this bill we are com-
mitting ourselves to improving the health of 
women and children in impoverished areas, 
helping prevent illness, and improving eco-
nomic conditions in poorer countries. 
Every parent deserves the opportunity to put 
nutritional food on the table to take care of 
their families. 
By supporting these effective nutrition inter-
ventions, we unlock the ability to begin invest-
ing in the well-being, growth, and productivity 
of our generations to come. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4693. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

f 
PARTICIPATION 
OF 
TAIWAN 
IN 
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZA-
TION 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 812) to direct the Secretary of State 
to develop a strategy to regain ob-
server status for Taiwan in the World 
Health Organization, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 812 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) 
is a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
charged with coordinating health efforts 
within the United Nations system. The 
World Health Assembly (WHA) is the deci-
sion-making body of the WHO, which con-
venes annually in May to set the policies and 
priorities of the organization. Statehood is 
not a requirement for attendance at the 
WHA, and numerous observers, including 
non-members and non-governmental organi-
zations, attended the most recent virtual 
WHA in May 2020. 
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in 
the WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with 
strong support from successive United States 
Administrations, Congress, and like-minded 
WHO Member States, and during a period of 
improved Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan re-
ceived an invitation to attend the WHA as an 
observer under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. 
Taiwan received the same invitation each 
year until 2016, when following the election 
of President Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic 
Progressive Party, Taiwan’s engagement in 
the international community began facing 
increased resistance from the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). Taiwan’s invitation to 
the 2016 WHA was received late and included 
new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. 
The WHO did not invite Taiwan to attend 
the WHA as an observer in 2017, 2018, 2019, or 
2020. 
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
world health, having provided financial and 
technical assistance to respond to numerous 
global health challenges. Taiwan has in-
vested over $6,000,000,000 in international 
medical and humanitarian aid efforts im-
pacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by do-
nating $1,000,000 and providing 100,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment. Through the 
Global Cooperation and Training Frame-
work, the United States and Taiwan have 
jointly conducted training programs for ex-
perts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and 
Zika. In 2020, after successfully containing 
the spread of the novel coronavirus within 
its borders while upholding democratic prin-
ciples, Taiwan generously donated millions 
of pieces of personal protective equipment 
and COVID–19 tests to countries in need. 
These diseases know no borders, and Tai-
wan’s needless exclusion from global health 
cooperation increases the dangers presented 
by global pandemics. 
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
faced increased resistance from the PRC. 
Taiwan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly 
of the International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion (ICAO), despite participating as a guest 
at the organization’s prior summit in 2013. 
Taiwan’s requests to participate in the Gen-
eral Assembly of the International Criminal 
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also 
been rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates 
disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley Proc-
ess on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Aus-
tralia, until delegates from Taiwan were 
asked to leave. Since 2016, the Democratic 
Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
public of Panama, the Dominican Republic, 
Burkina Faso, the Republic of El Salvador, 
the Solomon Islands, and the Republic of 
Kiribati have terminated longstanding diplo-
matic relationships with Taiwan and granted 
diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
(5) Congress has established a policy of 
support for Taiwan’s participation in inter-
national 
bodies 
that 
address 
shared 
transnational challenges, particularly in the 
WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th 
Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Congress, and 
S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct the 
Secretary of State to establish a strategy 
for, and to report annually to Congress on, 
efforts to obtain observer status for Taiwan 
at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 1151 
in the 113th Congress, directing the Sec-
retary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, di-
recting the Secretary to report on a strategy 
to gain observer status for Taiwan at the 
INTERPOL Assembly. However, since 2016, 
Taiwan has not received an invitation to at-
tend any of these events as an observer. 
(b) AUGMENTATION OF REPORT CONCERNING 
THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (c) of section 1 
of the Act entitled, ‘‘To address the partici-
pation of Taiwan in the World Health Orga-
nization’’ (Public Law 108–235; 22 U.S.C. 290 
note) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(3) An account of the changes and im-
provements the Secretary of State has made 
to the United States plan to endorse and ob-
tain observer status for Taiwan at the World 
Health Assembly, following any annual 
meetings of the World Health Assembly at 
which Taiwan did not obtain observer sta-
tus.’’. 
(2) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by paragraph (1) shall take effect and 
apply beginning with the first report re-
quired under subsection (c) of section 1 of the 
Act entitled, ‘‘To address the participation 
of Taiwan in the World Health Organization’’ 
(Public Law 108–235; 22 U.S.C. 290 note) that 
is submitted after the date of the enactment 
of this Act: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 812. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 812, a bill to direct the Secretary 
of State to develop a strategy to regain 
observer status for Taiwan in the 
World Health Organization, and for 
other purposes. 
S. 812 will help support Taiwan’s ef-
fort to gain observer status at the 
World Health Assembly, the decision-
making body of the World Health Orga-
nization. 
Since the end of 2019, the unprece-
dented COVID–19 pandemic has re-
minded the global community of the 
importance of international coopera-
tion 
and 
collaboration 
on 
global 
health. 
Taiwan has been a leader on global 
health. While the People’s Republic of 
China was actively censoring public 
discussion of and silencing doctors 
about the effects and outbreak of the 
virus in China itself, Taiwan was sav-
ing lives globally with its early detec-
tion and dissemination of information 
about the virus. 
Despite its proximity to the original 
outbreak in China, Taiwan employed a 
strategy of social distancing, border 
controls, mask mandates, quarantine,

and contact tracing so that it suc-
ceeded in suppressing widespread trans-
mission. Incredibly, with a population 
of 23.5 million, Taiwan experienced 
roughly 
37,000 
confirmed 
COVID–19 
cases and fewer than 900 deaths. That is 
a tremendous feat compared to every-
body else. 
Taiwan was not only able to use its 
knowledge to effectively respond to the 
COVID–19 pandemic within its own bor-
ders, but it shared its expertise and 
medical supplies when the world badly 
needed it most. Taiwan donated mil-
lions of masks and PPE to many coun-
tries around the world, including here 
in the United States. 
These actions symbolize Taiwan’s 
leadership and contributions to global 
health security and demonstrate why 
it ought to be part of the global con-
versation on public health. Unfortu-
nately, China has tried to limit and 
constrain Taiwan’s meaningful partici-
pation in all international organiza-
tions, including pressuring the WHO to 
strip Taiwan of its observer status in 
the WHA in 2017. As the co-chair of the 
Taiwan Caucus, I can tell you that 
makes no sense. 
This bipartisan measure would sup-
port efforts that enable Taiwan to 
share its public health expertise and 
experience with the world at times 
when we need it badly. 
Led by Senator MENENDEZ, this legis-
lation has already passed the Senate. 
The House Foreign Affairs Committee 
was proud to pass out of committee a 
near-identical bipartisan measure led 
by Representative YOUNG KIM of Cali-
fornia. 
Passage of this bill today, ahead of 
the World Health Assembly meeting 
next month, would not only be timely; 
it would also demonstrate the strong 
bipartisan, bicameral commitment the 
U.S. Congress has to our democratic 
friend Taiwan. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
adopt this resolution, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 812, directing 
the Secretary of State to develop a 
strategy to regain observer status for 
Taiwan in the World Health Organiza-
tion. 
This bill has passed the House in 
each of the last three Congresses, so I 
am glad the two Chambers have finally 
come together to send this bill to the 
President’s 
desk 
before 
the 
World 
Health Assembly next month. 
I thank Representative YOUNG KIM 
for introducing the House version of 
this bill early last year and former 
Representative Ted Yoho for his work 
on this issue in previous Congresses. 
Taiwan is a model contributor to 
global health, and Taiwan’s exclusion 
from the WHO isn’t just unfair; it is 
dangerous. 
The world is still paying the price of 
the Chinese Communist Party’s cover-
up of the original COVID–19 outbreak 
in Wuhan. Taiwan’s exclusion from the 
World Health Organization made the 
situation even worse by depriving the 
world of Taiwan’s early warning. 
Unfortunately, Xi Jinping and the 
CCP are continuing to jeopardize glob-
al health by marginalizing Taiwan. The 
CCP is hijacking the WHO to advance 
its own political agenda. Taiwan has 
been totally excluded from partici-
pating in the WHO’s annual World 
Health Assembly since 2016. 
Despite the CCP’s interference, Tai-
wan is a model democracy that makes 
the world a better place. The people of 
Taiwan deserve to participate in the 
World Health Organization, so I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Representative MEUSER
for 
yielding, and I thank Representative 
CONNOLLY, 
Chairman 
MEEKS, 
and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL
for their 
leadership on this very important 
issue. 
I rise in strong support of this bipar-
tisan, bicameral effort to help restore 
Taiwan’s observer status at the World 
Health Organization and World Health 
Assembly. 
I am proud to have introduced the 
House version of this bill, which has 
nearly 130 bipartisan cosponsors. 
Time and time again, Taiwan has 
proven to be a trusted ally of the 
United States and to be a world leader 
in global health security. 
From 2009 until 2017, Taiwan had ob-
server status in the WHO and WHA, but 
it was revoked due to pressure from the 
Chinese Government. This bill would 
direct the Secretary of State to imple-
ment a strategy to restore Taiwan’s 
observer status. 
I am hopeful that today we can send 
a united message to the people of Tai-
wan that we value their input and that 
giving them a seat at the table benefits 
all of us. 
Support for Taiwan is more impor-
tant than ever. We all know today that 
as Russia invades Ukraine, China is 
eyeing Taiwan. A threat to freedom 
anywhere is a threat to freedom every-
where. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
support this effort and give the people 
of Taiwan a voice in vital information 
sharing in the World Health Organiza-
tion and World Health Assembly. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lead this 
effort and will continue to be an un-
wavering voice for global human rights 
and freedom. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, diseases 
and pandemics know no borders. Tai-
wan is a critical player in global 
health, and it is a global transpor-
tation hub. In blocking Taiwan from 
the WHO, the CCP is placing the world 
at risk to soothe their own insecu-
rities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Why is this bill important at this 
time, Mr. Speaker? It is important be-
cause an authoritarian, delusional au-
tocrat in Moscow is wreaking havoc 
and inflicting death on the ground and 
from the skies on an innocent people 
seeking freedom in Ukraine. 
It is important that other autocrats 
and authoritarian regimes understand 
that they will pay a heavy price for 
such behavior, that we will not resolve 
disputes that way in the 21st century, 
and that the consequences will be se-
vere. 
Isolating Taiwan is part of a policy 
to intimidate, threaten, and assault de-
mocracy on the island of Taiwan. We 
can’t be a party to that. 
Taiwan has a voice. Taiwan has ex-
pertise. It can contribute in a pan-
demic, and it should not be silenced be-
cause of somebody’s political agenda. 
That is what this bill is about. That is 
why this Congress should speak with 
one voice and support this important 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I 
support S. 812, which came to us from the 
Senate, and which calls for the Administration 
to develop a strategy for Taiwan to regain ob-
server status at the World Health Organiza-
tion. 
As we know, Taiwan stands as a beacon of 
democracy in Asia—and indeed, an example 
for much of the world—and offers a stark con-
trast to the totalitarian model of Xi Jinping 
across the Taiwan Strait in Mainland China. 
As a result, the People’s Republic of China 
has doubled down on its longstanding efforts 
to delegitimize Taiwan and keep it from partici-
pating in international organizations. 
As we rediscovered in 2020, however, a 
deadly virus doesn’t play politics, and crosses 
borders without regard to diplomatic niceties. 
To kowtow to Communist China and ex-
clude Taiwan from having even an observer 
status at the World Health Organization is to 
play politics with global health. 
It is especially galling when one recalls that 
pernicious misrepresentations were made by 
the PRC to the World Health Organization at 
the onset of the COVID–19 pandemic, and the 
warnings sounded by Taiwan as to the true 
nature and origins of the pandemic were ig-
nored by the WHO. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to note that I, 
along with my colleague from New Jersey, 
JEFF VAN DREW, also introduced legislation 
last year, H.R. 1775, to provide for a vehicle 
for victims of State misrepresentations to the 
World Health Organization to seek redress 
using US courts. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 812, and 
for this Administration to devise and imple-
ment the strategy this timely legislation calls 
for to allow our democratic partner Taiwan to 
accede to the World Health Organization as 
an observer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4552 
April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of S. 812, a bill to direct the 
Secretary of State to develop a strategy to re-
gain observer status for Taiwan in the World 
Health Organization (WHO), and for other pur-
poses. 
This bill directs the Department of State to 
include additional information in its annual re-
ports concerning Taiwan’s participation at the 
WHO’s World Health Assembly (WHA) as an 
observer. 
The report shall describe changes and im-
provements to the State Department’s plan to 
support Taiwan’s observer status at the WHA, 
following any meetings at which Taiwan did 
not participate under such status. 
The measure also directs the Secretary of 
State to establish a strategy for obtaining ob-
server status at the WHA, the decision-making 
body of the WHO. 
Taiwan is excluded from most global organi-
zations such as the WHO, the U.N. health 
agency, because of the objections of China, 
which considers the island one of its provinces 
and not a separate country. 
Taiwan cannot be excluded from the global 
health body because as we have seen, infec-
tious viruses like the COVID–19 pandemic, 
have the ability to transcend all borders. 
Taiwan has contributed more than $6 billion 
in international medical and humanitarian aid 
efforts to over 80 countries since 1996 and 
donated millions of personal protective and 
testing equipment during the COVID–19 cri-
ses. 
After successfully suppressing the spread of 
COVID within its borders, Taiwan also gener-
ously donated millions of pieces of personal 
protective equipment and testing reagents to 
countries in need. 
Taiwan is an important partner to the United 
States, and we must assist their effort to par-
ticipate at the W.H.O. 
Taiwan’s absence from the World Health 
Assembly over the last several years may 
negatively impact us all, since public health is 
safeguarded when everyone is engaged. 
In the wake of the COVID–19 pandemic it is 
now more important than ever for all nations 
to come together and share information re-
garding public health. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
S. 812 because the U.S. should support Tai-
wan’s involvement with the international com-
munity on all matters regarding public health. 
These efforts will benefit global public 
health, and potentially save many lives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 812. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY 
OF 
FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN 
J. 
ROY ROWLAND, JR. 
(Mr. BISHOP of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
as dean of the Georgia delegation, I re-
gret to inform the House that our 
former colleague, the Honorable James 
Roy Rowland, Jr., passed away. He was 
a beloved husband, father, and friend. I 
had the honor of working with him and 
serving with him in the Georgia State 
legislature as well as here in this 
House of Representatives. 
He was courageous in his convictions 
and a steadfast advocate for better 
healthcare for all Americans, espe-
cially our military veterans. 
He served in the House from 1983 
through 1995. During that time, he was 
a member of several committees in-
cluding the Veterans’ Affairs, Armed 
Services, Public Works and Transpor-
tation, and Government Operations, as 
well as the Select Committee on Nar-
cotics Abuse and Control and the Se-
lect Committee on Children, Youth, 
and Families. 
We were both Distinguished Eagle 
Scouts, and I had the pleasure of pre-
senting him with that award in 2014. In 
attendance were many current and 
former congressional colleagues, both 
Democrats and Republicans. It was a 
testament to the warmth and care he 
embodied as well as his bipartisanship. 
I noted at the time that the trail 
that Eagle Scouts walk never ends. 
Such was the life of J. Roy Rowland 
who became an Eagle Scout in 1942. He 
went on to serve the U.S. Army and 
was a veteran of World War II. He was 
a physician, an author, a philan-
thropist, and a public servant who 
made our community and our world a 
better place to live in so many ways. 
He led a distinguished and honorable 
life, and he will be greatly missed. Our

thoughts and prayers go out to his 
wife, Luella, his children, and his en-
tire family. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that this House 
observe a moment of silence in remem-
brance of the late Honorable James 
Roy Rowland, Jr. 
f 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Holocaust Remem-
brance Day in memory of the 6 million 
Jews who were systematically hunted 
down, rounded up, and murdered in 
cold blood by the Nazi regime and their 
evil collaborators. 
Millions of other innocent civilians 
were also targeted by the Nazis, includ-
ing people with disabilities, members 
of the LGBTQ community, Roma, 
Sinti, Slavs, and any other person 
deemed to be inferior by Adolph Hitler 
and his coconspirators. And yet, Mr. 
Speaker, the anti-Semitism that fueled 
the Nazi’s genocidal campaign sadly is 
still alive and well today. 
According to the Anti-Defamation 
League, there were 2,717 anti-Semitic 
incidents in the United States last 
year, averaging more than seven inci-
dents per day. That is the highest num-
ber ever recorded by the ADL since it 
began tracking anti-Semitic incidents 
in 1979. More than 75 years after the 
Holocaust, that is plainly unaccept-
able. 
On this day, Yom HaShoah, we must 
recommit ourselves to rooting out 
anti-Semitism wherever we find it. We 
must never forget the atrocities of the 
Holocaust. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CONNOR DANIEL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 
achievements of Connor Daniel, the 
new World Champion in English Sport-
ing Clay Shooting. 
A student at Savannah Christian 
School, Connor attended the 2022 World 
English Sporting Clay Championship in 
San Antonio, Texas, with 1,000 other 
competitors. The event, held at the Na-
tional Shooting Complex, pitted some 
of the top shooters in each classifica-
tion against one another in the spirit 
of competition. 
Connor is a fierce competitor and 
participates on the Savannah Christian 
Sporting Clays team that competes in 
the GISA Scholastic Clay League as 
well. Throughout the competition he 
was shooting right on target and man-
aged to bring home the Sub Junior 
World Championship. 
It is always a great day when a 
championship is brought home to the 
First District of Georgia, be it a State 
championship or a world championship. 
I am so honored to represent a district 
with young people who exemplify what 
it means to work hard, compete, and 
win championships. 
I congratulate Connor. His hard work 
and dedication to his craft have paid 
off, and I can’t wait to see what he does 
in the future. 
f 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Holocaust Re-
membrance Day. Today, we honor and 
remember the 6 million Jews and 
countless others who were murdered 
during the Holocaust, as well as the 
families who were torn apart. 
As a founder and cochair of the Con-
gressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Re-
lations, I am committed to ensuring 
that our country never forgets this his-
tory and that we educate younger gen-
erations about this atrocity. 
Today and every day, we must speak 
truth to power. ‘‘Never again’’ is more 
than a slogan. It is an unwavering com-
mitment to combating anti-Semitism 
and hate wherever they exist. 
f 
TERRORIST WATCH LIST 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, last week 
Customs and Border Protection re-
leased their monthly report detailing 
how bad President Biden’s border crisis 
has become. 
The numbers are quite startling. In 
March alone, CBP confirmed 221,303 mi-
grant encounters at our southern bor-
der. This number is up a whopping 33 
percent from February and an incred-
ible 542 percent since 2020. 
Making matters worse, the numbers 
show that 42 people on the terrorist 
watch list tried to enter our country il-
legally since President Biden took of-
fice. Thankfully, due to the hard work 
and diligence of law enforcement offi-
cers on the southern border, they were 
arrested. 
Although this begs the question: If 
we found 42 people on the terrorist 
watch list since January of 2021, how 
many more are in our country today 
out of the more than 200,000 illegal im-
migrants whom we know evaded law 
enforcement? 
Unfortunately, 
we 
will 
probably 
never know until it is too late. Thanks 
to President Biden’s open border poli-
cies, Americans must come to terms 
with the fact that until Republicans re-
gain control of Congress and the White 
House, potential terrorists continuing 
to file through our borders is just a 
way of life. 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, A LEADER 
AND TRAILBLAZER 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
has lost a lifelong leader and trail-
blazer—Madeleine Albright—a woman I 
had the chance to know and to learn 
from, and a woman with whom I shared 
a first name. Madeleine Albright was a 
woman of clarity, grace, intellect, and 
humor—a leader throughout the globe. 
She was an example to many women, 
like me, becoming our Nation’s first fe-
male Secretary of State and, at the 
time, the highest ranking woman ever 
in our government. Years ago, in admi-
ration, I adopted one of Albright’s sub-
tle, yet powerful, diplomatic tools— 
wearing a brooch each day to signify 
something about my work or my heart. 
As a child, Secretary Albright and 
her family fled war-torn Eastern Eu-
rope. Deeply inspired by her new coun-
try, she dedicated her life’s work to 
lifting up democracies at home and 
around the world and strengthening 
NATO with the goal of preventing wars 
in Europe like the one that had forced 
her family from their home. Her pas-
sion for peace inspires my own, espe-
cially as I watch the devastating atroc-
ities in Ukraine. 
Dedicated to democracies around the 
globe, she often recalled her father’s 
own worries that Americans took their 
own democracy for granted. Madeleine 
Albright knew that democracies are 
fragile, yet resilient, and that it mat-
ters what world we leave our grand-
children. 
May her memory be a blessing and 
her legacy be a guide.

HONORING ROBERT J. WRIGHT 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I recognize tonight my good 
friend, Mr. Robert J. Wright. He is a 
local legend and cohost of the ‘‘Robert 
and Erin Show’’ on KEEL Radio in 
Shreveport, Louisiana. 
After 50 years on the air and an illus-
trious career, Robert has decided to re-
tire. He will be sorely missed in our 
area. It is truly difficult to imagine our 
region without his voice on the air-
ways. He is a consummate professional 
broadcaster, always informative, enter-
taining, and genuinely tuned in to the 
people and issues of Louisiana. 
Fifty years in any career field is an 
extraordinary accomplishment, but 50 
years of consistently compelling radio 
is an achievement that few others can 
ever boast. 
I congratulate Robert on his retire-
ment and on a half century of devotion 
to his craft. We all hope he will finally 
be able to get some sleep in the morn-
ings. He has earned it. God bless.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF 
CONNECTICUT VOICES OF FREE-
DOM CHOIR 
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to celebrate the Voices of Freedom 
choir at the University of Connecticut 
on their 50th anniversary. 
Voices of Freedom is a unique ensem-
ble of approximately 80 or more stu-
dents that provides personal elevation 
and enlightenment of the gospel and 
spiritual music of the Black experience 
church. 
Gospel music promotes a spirit of 
hope. Music has healing power, and the 
existence of this choir on this campus 
at this time is more important now 
than ever. 
I also extend heartfelt congratula-
tions to the Voices of Freedom not 
only on celebrating 50 years of minis-
tering through music at the University 
of Connecticut, but a special congratu-
lations to their director, Reverend Lisa 
Clayton, who is celebrating 27 years 
leading the choir. Reverend Lisa Clay-
ton’s steadfast leadership has been key 
to the success and longevity of the 
Voices of Freedom Gospel Choir. 
I thank them for all they do to ele-
vate the importance of stories through 
song.

HONORING GERDA WEISSMANN 
KLEIN 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, today, on Holocaust Remem-
brance Day, I honor the life of Gerda 
Weissmann Klein, who passed away on 
April 3. 
Gerda was born in Poland in May 1925 
and was only a teenager when her 
homeland was invaded by the Nazis. In 
1942, she was sent to the Gross-Rosen 
camp system. 
In 1945, Gerda was taken on a 3- 
month death march through Czecho-
slovakia. Luckily, the failed ignition of 
an incendiary device saved Gerda and 
120 other women, who were liberated 
soon after. 
After the war, Gerda immigrated to 
western New York, my home, to raise 
her family, and she traveled the coun-
try sharing her story. Gerda’s first 
book, ‘‘All But My Life,’’ told her story 
and was adapted into an Oscar-winning 
documentary called ‘‘One Survivor Re-
members.’’ 
Gerda has received numerous honors 
and awards, including the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. Gerda also spoke 
before the United Nations General As-
sembly on the first International Holo-
caust Remembrance Day. 
Gerda is survived by 3 children, 8 
grandchildren, 
and 
18 
great-grand-
children. May her memory be a bless-
ing to us all. 
CONGRESS SHOULD FUND GLOBAL 
VACCINATIONS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to encourage my col-
leagues to pass a bill recognizing that 
viruses don’t respect borders and that 
the United States has a moral impera-
tive to lead the world in vaccine diplo-
macy. 
The only way to reach our goal of a 
70 percent vaccination rate worldwide 
is to fund global vaccination efforts. 
We have the best vaccines in the world, 
and plenty of them, but we lack the po-
litical will to use them. Without this 
funding, people around the world will 
die, and future variants and surges will 
be more likely here at home. 
I implore my colleagues to fund glob-
al COVID vaccinations and treatments. 
A supplemental relief bill that does not 
fund global vaccinations is not a bill 
that prevents and prepares for COVID 
surges. It would be a humanitarian set-
back and a threat to the American re-
covery. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
today, 
former 
Secretary 
Madeleine 
Albright was funeralized at the Na-
tional Cathedral. 
I rise today to pay tribute to a great 
American and a woman who exuded 
confidence and knowledge of worldwide 
diplomacy. She was appointed by Presi-
dent Clinton and became a champion 
for women’s rights around the world. 
I remember meeting her on the bor-
der of Bangladesh, meeting with young 
girls who had just been trafficked and 
returned to their native land. How em-
pathetic she was to these young girls 
who had been traumatized and were 
Bangladesh citizens. 
I understand, as well, that she cared 
about ensuring that human rights was 
heard around the world. She was a 
fighter against anti-Semitism because 
of the history of her own life and fam-
ily, fleeing Europe during that time. 
As we stand against the ideals of ha-
tred and anti-Semitism, we stand in 
honor of former Secretary Madeleine 
Albright. 
May she rest in peace, and may her 
legacy be one of worldwide diplomacy, 
the rights of women, peace, and solu-
tions to hatred. We never hope to have 
hatred in this land and in this world. 
May she rest in peace and rest in 
power. 
f 
CONGRATULATING SCOTTIE 
SCHEFFLER 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
offer my most sincere congratulations 
to Scottie Scheffler for his decisive vic-
tory at this year’s Masters Tour-
nament. 
For 88 years, the world’s greatest 
golfers have traveled to Georgia to 
play the world’s greatest golf course, 
the Augusta National. Every April, 
sports fans across the world get a 
glimpse into the beauty and majesty 
that Georgia’s 12th District has to 
offer. 
This year, after shooting 69 in the 
first round and 67 in the second, Mr. 
Scheffler held on to a 3-stroke lead 
heading into the championship on Sun-
day. 
As he made that walk to the 18th 
green, there was no doubt Scottie 
would walk away with that iconic 
green jacket, something every golfer 
dreams about. 
Thanks to his strong play, he also 
had the luxury of being able to 4-putt 
his way to victory, something else that 
every golfer dreams about. But Scottie 
shouldn’t worry. In the words of past 
winner Seve Ballesteros, when they 
asked how in the world did he 4-putt 16, 
he said: ‘‘I miss. I miss. I miss. I 
make.’’

INFLATION, IMMIGRATION, AND 
INCOMPETENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, according to The Washington 
Post, Washington Democrats have di-
agnosed their messaging as the source 
of their current political problems. My 
colleagues and I are here tonight to 
offer a second opinion. 
Mr. Speaker, the Washington Demo-
crats certainly do have a problem, but 
it is not caused by their messaging; it 
is being caused by their policies. That 
is clear for everybody to see. 
You see, the phrase ‘‘messaging prob-
lem’’ is a phrase that is familiar to us 
on Capitol Hill. It presumes that the 
American people would support your 
agenda; they just haven’t heard it yet, 
or they don’t quite understand it. But 
that is certainly not the problem for 
these Washington Democrats. 
It is not their policies, and it is not 
that their policies are too sophisti-
cated for the rest of us to understand, 
nor is it that the American people

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4564 
April 27, 2022 
don’t know what is good for them. It is 
exactly the opposite. 
The American people know what is 
best for them and their families, and 
they can see very plainly the results of 
Washington Democrats’ one-party rule. 
They do not like it. 
The plain result of the Washington 
Democrat agenda can be summed up in 
what I have been calling back home the 
three i’s. You might narrow it down to, 
currently: inflation, immigration, and 
incompetence. 
We can talk about the crippling in-
flation, the sky-high illegal immigra-
tion, and the unprecedented incom-
petence of the Democrats in charge in 
the White House, too. 
Let’s talk about inflation. When 
President Biden and Washington Demo-
crats assumed control of the Federal 
Government, inflation was at 1.4 per-
cent. Now, here we are 1 year and tril-
lions of dollars in government spending 
later, and inflation has reached 8.5 per-
cent. It is at a 41-year high, and it is 
still climbing. 
For Americans doing the math at 
their kitchen table, let’s put that in 
real terms. That means these price in-
creases will cost you two paychecks 
this year and probably two more next 
year. 
Rather than accepting responsibility, 
what are they doing? President Biden 
and Washington Democrats have told 
us all that it is Russia’s fault, and they 
advise that we should buy an electric 
car. 
Let’s talk about illegal immigration. 
With regard to that, the policies of 
President Biden and these Democrats 
have resulted in record levels of illegal 
immigration, record levels of illicit 
drugs flowing into our country, and a 
humanitarian 
catastrophe 
at 
the 
southern border. 
Today, the Biden administration is 
actually planning to lift the public 
health restrictions of title 42 that were 
really the last remaining tool in the 
toolbox to control illegal immigration. 
Believe it or not—get this—this is hap-
pening at the very time that they are 
suing in Federal court to keep Ameri-
cans masked up. 
According to the Biden administra-
tion, if you are an illegal immigrant, 
COVID restrictions are over. But if you 
are an American citizen, hey, you bet-
ter buckle up because these COVID re-
strictions are going to be around for a 
while. 
Incompetence, I don’t think we need 
to elaborate too much. Everyone can 
see this with their own eyes. It wasn’t 
so long ago that Washington Demo-
crats tried to cast themselves as the 
party of competence. Remember that, 
in the election cycle? 
But many congressional Democrats 
still can’t be bothered to show up here 
at work. Many haven’t voted in person 
in a long, long time. Some phone into 
committee hearings from bed, literally. 
The story at President Biden’s agen-
cies isn’t much better. Another tax 
season has come and gone, yet Biden’s 
Treasury Department is still working 
on getting last year’s tax refunds out 
to the American people. 
Remember the fatal troop with-
drawal, the debacle from Afghanistan. 
No one at Biden’s Defense Department 
has been fired or held accountable for 
the chaos that left 13 American sol-
diers dead. 
The President himself continues to 
confuse basic policies from the White 
House podium on a near-daily basis. 
The American people deserve com-
petence in government. But they have 
received, by far, with this administra-
tion, the most incompetent govern-
ment of our lifetimes. 
Mr. Speaker, again, there is a reason 
that politicians like to blame their 
problems on messaging. It implies that 
if only the American people heard our 
message, they would support it. In this 
case, it is the American people who are 
hearing very clearly the Democrat 
message, and they reject it. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me 
on the floor this evening, where we will 
be talking about the broad array, the 
panoply, of crises created by this ad-
ministration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
don’t like to consider myself an overly 
partisan Congressman, so I will lead off 
my speech by quoting two Democrats 
kind of as a background for the rest of 
this speech. 
In Politico—so you know it is true— 
an unnamed Democrat quotes Barack 
Obama as saying don’t underestimate 
Joe’s ability to blank things up. 
Former Obama Defense Secretary Rob-
ert Gates says that Joe Biden has been 
wrong on nearly every major foreign 
policy and national security issue over 
the last four decades. I want my Demo-
crat friends to think about that. 
Now, I am not an expert on foreign 
policy, but it seems the goal in the 
Ukrainian-Russian war should be to 
end hostilities. On the internet, you 
can find numbers from 2,000 to 20,000 ci-
vilians that have died so far. Of course, 
it appears as though tens of thousands 
of military personnel have passed away 
as well. Every day, the number of 
Ukrainian and military deaths con-
tinues to go up. 
I will point out that Ukraine has the 
second-lowest birth rate of the 100 larg-
est countries in the world, and Russia 
also has a low birth rate. When I hap-
pened to be in San Diego about a year 
ago, in that sector at that time—just 
that sector and that time—the second 
most common nationality to enter the 
United States was Russian. In other 
words, both Russia and Ukraine should 
be desperate to hold onto the young 
people that they have. 
b 1830 
We have helped Ukraine, and fortu-
nately Ukraine has staved off this inex-
cusable aggression. Every day that 
there are good reports from Ukraine, 
we should be glad for the successes 
that Ukraine has had. 
However, obviously, a goal should be 
to end this war, and we should be work-
ing towards the end of the war to save 
the lives and to save the economic dev-
astation that we will leave behind in 
Ukraine. 
President Biden and Defense Sec-
retary Austin should stop and think 
whether their statements are more or 
less likely to bring Russia to the nego-
tiating table. I encourage my Demo-
crat friends to give a little bit of guid-
ance to this administration as to how 
to end this war. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. Some wise 
counsel there. I wish they would heed 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, folks 
on the left have accused us good Re-
publicans of complaining about infla-
tion. They say we have no plan for low-
ering the cost of food, clothes, or gaso-
line. 
Of course, the Democrats have con-
trolled Congress for the last 15 months, 
Mr. Speaker, as you well know. During 
that 
time, 
they 
have 
successfully 
rammed through trillions in unneces-
sary Federal spending. 
Let’s look at where that has gotten 
us. Prices for goods and services Amer-
icans rely on rose by 8.5 percent in 
March 2022 compared to March 2021. 
That 
is 
unacceptable 
for 
working 
Americans, 
especially 
for 
east 
Tennesseeans. 
That is not even the worst of it all. 
Even after all this spending raised 
costs for American families, the Demo-
crats still don’t think it was enough. 
They still think the multitrillion-dol-
lar high tax Build Back Better Act— 
which we have called build back broke, 
you can call it whatever you want—is a 
good idea. That bill will be cata-
strophic for price stability. 
Right now our country is dealing 
with the consequences of reckless gov-
ernment spending. All we seem to be 
doing is saddling more debt on the 
shoulders of future generations. We 
used to say we are piling it on our kids. 
Now it is our grandchildren and great- 
grandchildren, which some of the folks 
in this body, I am sure, have multiples 
of those. And that is not right. 
So to the critics on the left who com-
plain that Republicans don’t have a 
plan to address inflation, I ask you 
this: What is wrong with a plan to 
spend fewer taxpayer dollars and to be 
smarter about the money we do spend? 
This kind of fiscal responsibility is a 
legitimate solution to fixing the unsta-
ble prices that are worrying families in 
east Tennessee and across the country. 
Republicans should not be afraid to say 
that fiscal responsibility is our plan. 
My folks instilled in me a lot of val-
ues, and one of those is, ‘‘Don’t spend it 
if you don’t have it,’’ and ‘‘Just be-
cause you have it doesn’t mean you 
have got to spend it, dadgummit.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman 
JOHNSON, as always, for his lackluster 
leadership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4565 
April 27, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I told my friend that I would 
be faithful to him because he has been 
faithful to participate in all the Spe-
cial Order hours if I kept the trains 
running on time. 
I yield now to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), who I 
slighted earlier. I would invite him to 
talk more about all these crises we are 
facing. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Congressional Western 
Caucus, we were hosted by Congress-
men 
AUGUST
PFLUGER
and 
JODEY 
ARRINGTON recently in west Texas. We 
went there to explore, as they say it, 
food, fiber, and fuel. 
I am going to talk a little bit about 
the fuel part of that trip and how west 
Texas is poised to really contribute to 
America’s energy dominance. Just like 
northeastern 
Pennsylvania, 
west 
Texas’ energy is world class. We toured 
oil and gas drilling sites on the Per-
mian Basin and heard from producers 
about some of the cutting-edge solu-
tions they are implementing to reduce 
carbon emissions and get American en-
ergy to market more cleanly and effi-
ciently. 
From Midland, Texas, to Montrose, 
Pennsylvania, and much of the land in 
between, America is blessed with an 
abundance of natural resources. Amer-
ican energy—oil and natural gas—is 
right beneath our feet, ready to power 
our Nation and the world. 
Instead of embracing this fact, Presi-
dent Biden has thrust our Nation into 
an energy crisis by tying the hands of 
America’s energy producers. This ad-
ministration has made it very clear 
where it stands on the future of Amer-
ican energy. 
Make no mistake: American oil and 
natural gas is the key to lowering 
prices at the pump, stopping inflation, 
and building a stronger workforce. It 
all starts with harnessing American 
energy, from west Texas to northeast 
Pennsylvania, but that is only possible 
if this administration gets out of the 
way and allows American producers to 
take the lead. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for bring-
ing that up. Coming from an energy 
State like Louisiana, just like Penn-
sylvania, we know how important this 
is to us. Under the Trump administra-
tion, we had achieved energy domi-
nance. We could get back to that if 
they would just simply do the opposite 
of what they are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, inflation is 
an invisible tax that Americans pay 
every day. Everywhere you look, infla-
tion is wreaking havoc. At the gas sta-
tion, gas is up 48 percent; at the gro-
cery store, beef is up 20 percent; chick-
en, up 15 percent; butter, up 14 percent; 
fruits and vegetables, up 7 percent; cof-
fee, up 12 percent. 
At home, electricity is up 11 percent; 
furniture is up 15 percent; and even the 
rent is up 5 percent. 
What about a vacation? You still 
won’t be able to escape inflation, as ho-
tels are up 29 percent and airplane 
flights are up 23 percent. 
Recent graduates entering the work-
force will be forced to pay record-high 
rent and other expenses as they enter 
adulthood. New mothers and fathers 
will pay 10 percent higher prices for 
baby food. Many Americans who saved 
their entire lives to retire comfortably 
are now faced with the brutal realiza-
tion that they may not have saved 
enough. 
Even the Nashville airport, which is 
renovating and expanding, was hit hard 
by inflation when the price of a new 
satellite concourse jumped from $92 
million just last March to over $134 
million today. 
As you can see, inflation affects 
every aspect of our lives. It is costing 
the average American family an extra 
$433 per month, and it is expected to 
cost each household over $5,000 extra 
just this year alone. 
Inflation isn’t something you can 
easily turn off, but President Biden and 
congressional Democrats proved that 
their reckless, progressive policies can 
certainly turn it on. Since President 
Biden 
took 
office 
and 
Democrats 
gained control of both Chambers of 
Congress, inflation has increased every 
single month. 
They borrowed from future genera-
tions and spent trillions of hard-earned 
taxpayer dollars on wasteful govern-
ment programs and assured us that it 
wouldn’t cause inflation, even though 
we all knew it would. That is why it is 
so disingenuous that the President, his 
administration and Democratic allies 
in Congress, and the mainstream media 
are blaming inflation on the invasion 
of Ukraine. To use one of the Presi-
dent’s favorite words, that is pure ma-
larkey. 
Meanwhile, as my constituents feel 
more pain each day from the growing 
inflation disaster, the President and 
his administration hardly even men-
tion it, much less offer solutions except 
to propose spending trillions of dollars 
more that we don’t have, which will, of 
course, only make things worse. Just 
look at President Biden’s budget pro-
posal, where inflation is not mentioned 
even one time. Instead, it calls for 
spending a whopping $75 trillion over 
the next decade. 
There is no denying that the massive 
deficit spending got us into this harm-
ful mess, and doing more of the same 
certainly won’t get us out of it. I and 
my fellow conservatives have pushed 
back as hard as we can against the 
reckless approach to governing that 
our Democratic friends have taken, but 
we have been outnumbered and out-
voted. 
Even though we are outgunned for 
now, I will nevertheless continue to 
work hard with my fellow Republicans 
to do all we can to fight back on every 
wasteful spending bill the Democrats 
bring until our commonsense conserv-
ative reinforcements are elected in the 
fall and arrive in January. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE) has articulated so 
well what is on the hearts and minds of 
so many of our constituents. Inflation 
is a very real problem for the American 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
JOHNSON) for helping us get these im-
portant messages out. 
It has been about 2 months since Rus-
sia invaded our ally, Ukraine. Russia 
has spent nearly a year amassing hun-
dreds of thousands of troops and mili-
tary weaponry along Ukraine’s borders, 
with the backing of their northern 
neighbor, Belarus. Most people were 
doubtful that Ukraine would be able to 
successfully fight off these attacks for 
more than a few days. 
Amazingly, being surrounded the way 
they are, outnumbered and outgunned, 
they have been able to heroically hold 
off their Russian invaders. President 
Putin has justified his attack as a 
peacekeeping mission or a liberating 
one. In reality, it is really a thinly 
veiled 
attempt 
to 
frighten 
NATO 
against 
further 
expansion 
and, 
of 
course, muscle Ukraine’s neighbors 
into submission. 
Both NATO and the United States 
have a longstanding tradition of stand-
ing with sovereign nations who face ad-
versarial oppression, and that is ex-
actly what we are seeing in Eastern 
Europe as Putin attempts to forcefully 
reunite the Soviet Union. 
After 2 months of fighting and bil-
lions of dollars in aid sent to Ukraine, 
I have heard concerns of many people 
wondering why are we focusing so 
much money and attention on a con-
flict thousands of miles away? 
We have our own problems domesti-
cally, of course, which are self-in-
flicted, with rising inflation, the border 
crisis, crime, and food and energy 
shortages. 
Ultimately, this is a matter of free-
dom and self-sovereignty versus con-
cession. We could actually extinguish 
another Cold War from happening be-
fore it has a chance to grow, if we had 
taken action sooner. We could still 
take positive action now. 
The world all knew this conflict was 
coming. It has been brewing for a year 
before the invasion actually occurred. 
We shouldn’t have waited for blood to 
be shed before acting. 
If President Biden hadn’t shut down 
domestic energy production on his first 
day in office, the U.S. would have been 
more economically empowered to enact 
harsh financial sanctions at Russia’s 
first minor incursion. 
We could have been producing enough 
oil to export LNG overseas to our allies 
instead of watching Poland being cut 
off from natural gas. Wow, is that a 
surprise or not? We can’t dare have 
anybody speak up; otherwise, they will 
get their gas cut off. Why in the world 
are we claiming Nord Stream pipeline,

et cetera? The U.S. should be the one 
intervening, helping with energy inde-
pendence for us and our European al-
lies. 
So what is the focus of the Biden ad-
ministration? Yeah, we are starting up 
on Ukraine more, but what we are real-
ly looking at is that our military isn’t 
as ready as it should be. Instead of 
military readiness, President Biden 
wants to put the focus on turning us 
into a green Army, a green military, 
because we are chasing around .04 per-
cent of the atmosphere of carbon diox-
ide. That is the priority, not military 
readiness. Chasing carbon dioxide in-
stead of helping our allies chase invad-
ers out of their countries. That is not 
military readiness. 
The Stinger missiles we are sending, 
we need to be producing more of them. 
The Javelin missiles, same thing. We 
are still caught up probably in chip 
shortage problems. We need to be fo-
cused on military readiness for us and 
being able to be a good neighbor, as is 
sort of our obligation when we helped 
Ukraine become nuclear free back dur-
ing the Clinton era. 
Let’s not let down our ally. Let’s 
focus on what is going to help the 
American people work, not chasing 
CO2, but instead strengthening our 
military and looking out for our neigh-
bors and our allies, such as Ukraine. 
Taiwan is going to need our help, as 
well as the rest of our NATO obliga-
tions, as NATO membership seeks to 
increase, which will be a good thing for 
all of us. 
We can’t let this tyrant Putin keep 
getting away with this stuff. We must 
be strong and not quiver every time he 
decides to make another move. 
I appreciate this opportunity for all 
of us here to stand with Ukraine, stand 
with our allies around the world, and 
not just think that CO2 is going to be 
the biggest problem we face. Indeed, it 
is aggression by dictators that is the 
greatest threat. 
b 1845 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for that reminder about the impor-
tance of peace through strength; that 
weakness invites aggression and that is 
the only thing holding terrorists and 
tyrants at bay so many times in so 
many places over these 245 years of our 
existence. Certainly, after World War 
II it was the perception of a strong 
America. And if we project weakness 
like we are, we are all in danger. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD), who knows 
about the theater of war. 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Louisiana for this op-
portunity to speak about title 42. 
Mr. Speaker, in the last 14 months, 
this administration and its open-door 
policies have created the worst border 
crisis we have seen in decades, leaving 
our southern border very vulnerable to 
the dangerous cartels and our commu-
nities are vulnerable to the lethal 
drugs that they bring in. 
Every day, 2,000 migrants evade cap-
ture and illegally enter our country. 
That is over 300,000 illegal immigrants 
evading capture in the last 6 months 
alone. Unfortunately, our Border Pa-
trol warns us that this is only the 
known gotaways, and that the real 
number is likely much higher. 
By the President’s own admission, 
rolling back title 42 would cause a 
mass migration event and would cer-
tainly overwhelm our already over-
worked and undersupported Border Pa-
trol. Not only are Americans still held 
to a higher COVID protocol standard 
than the migrants at our southern bor-
der, but title 42 remains one of the only 
tools our overrun agents can use to get 
this swelling crisis under control. 
Ending title 42 won’t help President 
Biden fulfill his State of the Union 
promise to secure the southern border, 
it will only make this crisis that the 
administration 
has 
created 
more 
unsustainable. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend so much for 
that and for his service to our country. 
Having defended our Nation you 
know that if we don’t have a border, we 
not only don’t have safety and secu-
rity, but we also don’t even have sov-
ereignty. We don’t even have a coun-
try. We have to have a border, and this 
administration has given us none. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arkansas, (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Louisiana for yielding. 
And unlike my friend from Knox Coun-
ty, Tennessee, I have the utmost re-
spect for his ability to manage a Spe-
cial Order with great aplomb, style, 
and skill. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time to 
talk tonight about something that I 
have reflected on now for the 7 years 
that I have served in the House. Over 
those 7 years, I have been to our south-
west border 7 times, and I am in prepa-
ration right now to go back next week. 
So I rise tonight to bring attention 
to what is a growing crisis at our 
southwest border and share the fear 
and the frustration that are experi-
enced there by those communities, 
their law enforcement officers, their 
schools, their churches, and to reflect 
on the Biden administration’s just con-
tinued neglect there. 
Mr. Speaker, this is shocking to us 
because the first order of good govern-
ance by the executive is to protect the 
homeland, secure it, protect the people. 
Public safety is such a critical element 
in each of our communities so it makes 
no sense to any of us, whether we 
served for a brief period of time or for 
decades here, that our executive would 
leave our borders so open, so vulner-
able. 
Over the last 6 months, we have had 
over a million migrant encounters at 
our southern border, with over 221,000 
last month alone. That is a high for the 
Biden administration; 221,000 encoun-
ters. As my friend who just spoke sug-
gested, that doesn’t count the ones we 
don’t catch, the so-called getaways. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
overwhelming 
number of migrants swarming our 
southwest border, though, should come 
as no surprise based on the actions of 
the administration. So shocked, yes, 
because the executive has abandoned 
its primary mission. But surprise, no. 
And let me explain why, Mr. Speaker. 
In the earliest days of his Presidency, 
President Biden repealed the Trump- 
era policies that discouraged illegal 
immigrants from flooding our borders 
and kept our communities safe. And 
this was after a lot of trial and error. I 
think Mr. Trump went through pos-
sibly three Secretaries of Homeland 
Security and had a lot of frustration at 
this very tough challenge. 
But in President Biden’s decision to 
do away with those Trump policies 
that were ultimately working so effec-
tively, he replaced them with nothing. 
Now here again, I have to express 
shock—perhaps not surprise, as this is 
a crisis-oriented administration—but 
certainly shock because no successful 
manager ends a working policy and re-
places it with nothing. 
If you buy a business and you want to 
change the HR policy, you don’t just 
say: Hey, starting tomorrow, there is 
no HR policy. I will let you know what 
it is in a few months. It is nuts. 
President Biden’s efforts to suspend 
and terminate the border wall con-
struction are costing taxpayers be-
tween $1.8 and $2 billion because we are 
still paying those contractors to build 
the wall that is not being built due to 
contract penalties. Of course, the State 
of Texas has stepped in, and perhaps 
they are going to take on some of that 
and build it themselves using Texas’ 
taxpayer dollars for a national/inter-
national border. 
Now, as my friend said a few minutes 
ago, the administration is moving for-
ward to end what is called title 42. 
Title 42 has proven to be an effective 
effort at contributing to border secu-
rity. And while the Biden administra-
tion continues to use it less and less— 
in fact, last month, Mr. Speaker, 50 
percent of all the migrant encounters 
were processed for expulsion under 
title 42. So it is a critical element of 
both public health and public safety at 
the border. 
President Biden proposes to have 
that policy end here in just a few 
weeks, in the middle of May. Yet, he 
has proposed no policy to replace it. 
Again, we can expect a surge at our 
border. In fact, the Customs and Border 
Patrol, the executive branch agency re-
sponsible for guarding our border, se-
curing our border, expects that to 
surge to 18,000 migrant encounters per 
day. 
Now, whoa, let’s do the math because 
that sounds unbelievable, but you are 
talking 18,000. That is a half a million 
people per month. We are running right 
now annualized—I just reported it to 
you—at about 2 million encounters. 
And this is a half million per month; 
six million people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4567 
April 27, 2022 
Really? We really think that is bor-
der security? We think that is an ap-
propriate policy for this great Nation? 
It is insane. We will see the impact of 
this crisis throughout our commu-
nities. And as many of my colleagues 
have said, every State is a border State 
now as a result of this irresponsible ap-
proach. 
Mr. Speaker, the truth is the Biden 
administration has made it clear they 
have no plan, apparently, to secure our 
border. They certainly had a year and 
a half to demonstrate that they have 
one, and it is the American people that 
are suffering. 
So in summary, what are the rami-
fications? 
Millions coming into our country il-
legally without proper documentation 
and without the right public health 
concerns. 
Every State now is a border State. As 
reported a few minutes ago, there were 
42 people caught by CBP that are on 
the terrorist watch list. 
Now, let me say, I was at the Chula 
Vista Station years ago. And it was 
common practice that people would 
come in, they would throw their legal 
documents away—a passport, an ID of 
some kind—put them in the trash, sew 
them in their clothing, not disclosed, 
and say they are from whatever coun-
try they said they were from. And that 
basically creates a new identity for 
them in our system. 
Mr. Speaker, so if 42 people have been 
caught, how many have come in that 
are on that terrorist watch list that 
have a mal-intent on our country? 
Ramifications; 
record 
human 
traf-
ficking. And the cartels—our great 
friends in Mexico, virtually a cartel- 
driven border—making $5,000, $6,000 on 
Venmo, or in a promise to pay for each 
person trafficked, they are at millions, 
hundreds of millions—$400 million a 
month, some estimate—of making cash 
off this effort. 
Crime along the border is rampant, 
fentanyl and drugs on our streets. We 
lost 100,000 people last year to an 
opioid overdose. The fastest rising 
cause of death for young people across 
this country, 25 to 50 years old; 100,000 
dead, double what we lost in the Viet-
nam war, and fentanyl is pouring 
across that border. 
In fact, we have interdicted—again, 
what we have caught—we have inter-
dicted enough fentanyl, this vitally 
poisonous drug, to kill 7.4 billion peo-
ple, and this is spiraling costs to our 
counties and our border States. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no plan. There 
is no policy. There are national secu-
rity ramifications with an open border. 
It is irresponsible. It is incompetent. 
And I call on Secretary Mayorkas to 
resign his job as a failure. This admin-
istration has failed the American peo-
ple and the border. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Louisiana for his leadership. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. And I will 
tell him that he is not going to resign. 
The gentleman from Arkansas may 
not know this, but just a few hours ago 
in the Homeland Security Committee, 
one of our Republican colleagues from 
Mississippi, Congressman GUEST, asked 
the Secretary under oath, he said: Are 
you testifying, as you sit here today, 
that the southwest border is secure? 
‘‘Yes, I am.’’ 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
actually said under oath that that bor-
der is secure. So we must just be imag-
ining all of this. It is really unbeliev-
able, as we said. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Louisiana for holding this Special 
Order and for his leadership, for having 
these discussions at such an important 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, right now, millions of 
refugees have been displaced from their 
homes. Children are being forced to go 
without food, clothing, and shelter, and 
thousands of civilians are being mur-
dered in the streets. 
These are the effects of the Russian 
Federation’s war against the free and 
sovereign 
people 
of 
Ukraine. 
The 
human cost of this war is devastating. 
We need to bring an end to the hos-
tilities. The United States must stand 
ready to support the people of Ukraine 
with the tools and the weapons nec-
essary to fight against and defeat the 
Russian Army. 
There is another component to our 
mission that cannot be overstated. As 
our NATO allies continue to support 
President Zelenskyy in Ukraine, they 
will face economic retaliation from 
Russia. 
Just this morning, Russia announced 
that it would halt the sale of natural 
gas to Poland and Bulgaria. While this 
decision will create difficulties for the 
people living and working in these 
NATO countries, it also provides the 
United States an opportunity to stand 
with our allies and show Putin that his 
cheap and dirty gas is not needed to 
power this war. 
President Ronald Reagan once said, 
‘‘We know only too well that war 
comes not when the forces of freedom 
are strong, but when they are weak. It 
is then that tyrants are tempted.’’ 
Unfortunately, President Biden’s en-
ergy policies have so far not shown the 
strength that this moment requires. It 
is time to approve the permits needed 
to bring more American energy, like 
coal, oil, natural gas, and Marcellus 
shale to the market. We need to supply 
our neighbors and our allies with af-
fordable American energy. It is time to 
promote American energy dominance 
and show Russia that its energy re-
serves do not give Putin a blank check 
to attack his neighbors. 
America can provide the energy that 
our friends and allies need. It is time to 
come to the aid of Poland and Bul-
garia, and it is time to produce and 
supply American energy. 
Again, I thank Mr. JOHNSON for his 
leadership. 
b 1900 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, the gentleman is exactly 
right. It is time to shift back to Amer-
ican energy dominance, which we had 
under the previous administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to another doctor, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend and neighbor from Lou-
isiana. I represent the 36th District in 
East Texas. I thank the gentleman for 
having this. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden and his 
followers here in Congress seem to be-
lieve that their policies cannot cause 
inflation, or cause shortages of food, or 
even shortages of baby formula now. 
Instead of accepting their well-de-
served blame and providing a sensible 
path forward for the American people, 
they deflect; they blame President 
Trump, who has been out of office for 
more than 15 months now; or they 
blame Russia or Ukraine, even though 
gas and grocery prices were sky-
rocketing well before that conflict 
even began. 
As polling shows, the majority of 
Americans are well aware of the Presi-
dent’s mishandling of our economy. 
And while I believe that in November 
in those elections, they will show 
President 
Biden 
exactly 
what 
the 
American people are thinking about 
his policies, I don’t believe that he will 
actually change course. 
As long as he occupies the Oval Of-
fice, it is his duty to serve the Amer-
ican people, and I call on President 
Biden to immediately get with the pro-
gram, Mr. President. 
President Biden, please worry less 
about who is in charge of Twitter, or 
whether schoolchildren are wearing 
masks, and stop trying to force social-
ist woke policies on to a public that 
does not want them. Uphold your oath 
of office, the rule of law, and do your 
job. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, we have been calling on this 
President to do his job since he entered 
that office, and he hasn’t done it. I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s leadership on 
all these issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CLYDE), another good friend. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, it is no se-
cret that Biden’s self-inflicted border 
crisis continues to spiral out of con-
trol, and it is only getting worse. 
President Biden’s reckless immigra-
tion agenda may be easy for the left to 
dismiss, because it is what they want, 
but the heartbreaking and illegal con-
sequences of his failed policies are im-
possible to ignore.

April 27, 2022 
while fighting on the front lines of 
President Biden’s border crisis. 
To my knowledge, the President still 
hasn’t said one word about this young 
soldier’s tragic death. The President’s 
silence is deafening and disappointing. 
Keep in mind, it only took the Presi-
dent a matter of hours to accuse Bor-
der Patrol agents on horseback of mis-
conduct when dealing with a rush of 
Haitian illegals just a few months ago. 
Simply put, the President’s lack of 
interest and empathy reveals the sin-
ister, but undeniable, fact that the 
chaos at our southern border is inten-
tional. Since stepping foot into the 
White House, Joe Biden has eagerly de-
stroyed our border security, putting 
Border Patrol agents at risk and 
threatening every community across 
the country with an invasion of illegal 
aliens. 
From illegally defying a Federal 
court order to reinstate the remain in 
Mexico policy, to fighting to terminate 
title 42 next month, the Biden adminis-
tration has egregiously worked to un-
dermine President Trump’s successful 
solutions that protected our southern 
border. 
Biden’s border crisis also represents a 
significant economic burden on the 
American people. 
According to a recent study written 
by the Federation for American Immi-
gration Reform, or FAIR, the number 
of illegal aliens living in the United 
States increased by one million in 
President Biden’s first year in office, 
bringing the estimated total of illegal 
aliens in the country to 15.5 million. 
Additionally, FAIR’s fiscal analysis 
finds that the millions of illegal aliens 
currently residing in our great Nation 
are imposing a net fiscal burden of at 
least $143 billion, an increase of almost 
$10 billion since Joe Biden took office. 
Keep in mind, this comes at a time 
when American taxpayers are footing 
the bill for Democrats’ senseless spend-
ing and battling the consequences of 
40-year high inflation. 
The bottom line is that President 
Biden’s radical open-border agenda is 
illegal, intentional, and disastrous for 
our economy. It is no wonder over 60 
percent of Americans disapprove of 
Biden’s 
handling 
of 
immigration. 
Americans simply know the truth: 
President Biden puts illegal aliens first 
and Americans last, and the Biden ad-
ministration is actively working to 
cover up that truth. 
Today, we learned that Biden’s De-
partment of Homeland Security is cre-
ating a Disinformation Governance 
Board which will be led by political 
hack Nina Jankowicz. This is nothing 
more than a blatant attempt to install 
a ministry of truth in order to push 
Biden’s propaganda, lies, and radical 
agenda while concealing and censoring 
the truth about what is really hap-
pening at the southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, this is seriously dan-
gerous and wholly unconstitutional, 
which is why I am demanding that 
Congress 
immediately 
investigate 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Mayorkas’ Disinformation Governance 
Board. 
We need answers now, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
clear voice and clarion call for com-
petence and common sense. 
Mr. Speaker, what my colleagues 
have articulated tonight is our view, 
the American people’s view on the de-
bacle that is the unified government by 
the Democrats of the Congress and the 
White House. 
We have crippling inflation. We have 
sky high, illegal immigration. We have 
unprecedented incompetence at every 
level. It has yielded us, as you heard 
tonight, an energy crisis, a crime cri-
sis, a foreign policy crisis, and an agen-
da that seems almost intentional in its 
design to put the American people last 
instead of first. 
This is the opposite of what was pur-
sued under the previous administra-
tion, the opposite of the strides, the in-
credible achievements that we had ac-
complished in the first 2 years of the 
Trump administration with Repub-
licans in charge of this House and the 
Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the American 
people have had enough of this wildly 
progressive America last agenda. I 
think that they are going to let their 
voices be heard in this upcoming elec-
tion. And it is our prayer that we can 
survive between now and November, 
and in January when we take control 
again. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my col-
leagues for participating and joining 
me on the floor this evening, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and to address their remarks 
to the Chair. 
f 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
while we were on break for the last 2 
weeks, I spent some time at the south-
ern border in three sectors, the San 
Diego sector, the El Centro sector, and 
the Yuma sector. And I think it is im-
portant that we try to educate the 
Chair of what is going down there. 
I will start off by just talking about 
raw numbers that were recently re-
leased. And so our listeners under-
stand, when you talk about the border, 
there are two groups: There are people 
who want to find the Border Patrol and 
check in and get a future date for a 
hearing as they ask for asylum; and 
there are people who sneak across, 
which we refer to as gotaways. 
For certain reasons that I will soon 
address, the number of gotaways re-
cently went up dramatically. And the 
number of gotaways is always an esti-
mate because we don’t catch them, we 
don’t interview them. They are people 
who got away into the interior of the 
United States. 
But we believe right now, or the Bor-
der Patrol believes, that in March, 
there were 62,000 gotaways; people who 
were not interviewed; people who we 
don’t know who they are, who snuck in 
the country. 
We also believe in March there were 
90,000 people let in the country by the 
Border Patrol, usually asking for an 
asylum claim. 
When we combine these two num-
bers—and by the way, there are other 
people who are turned around, and that 
is why you sometimes hear people say 
there were 220,000 contacts in March, 
which is true, but not all of those peo-
ple were let in the country. 
We do believe 152,000 people were let 
in the country. At least in the last 3 
years, and as far as I know, forever, 
that is the highest number of people 
who have been let in the United States 
in 1 month. By way of comparison, a 
year ago, in March, we were at 63,000. 
So we went up from 63,000 to 153,000. 
And if you go before March 2021, 
March 2020, coincidentally, a different 
President, we were at 11,000. So we 
have gone from 11,000 in March of 2020, 
to 63,000, to 152,000. That is a crisis by 
any standard. 
Now, you might say, why are there so 
many more gotaways? Because when so 
many people are turning themselves in 
at the border—and by the way, there 
are about 10,000 unaccompanied minors 
who were let in this March as well, and 
it takes the Border Patrol a longer pe-
riod of time to process the minors. 
When there are so many people that 
have to be processed, the Border Patrol 
spends all their time doing paperwork 
and not guarding the border. There was 
a time when the Border Patrol reported 
to work and they guarded the border. 
Now, we were told in the sectors that I 
was at that 70 percent of the Border 
Patrol, when they show up at work, 
start doing paperwork. By the time 
their shift is over, 90 percent of the 
Border Patrol is doing paperwork, 
which is one of the reasons why so 
many more people are sneaking across 
the border. 
By the way, if you wanted to take il-
legal drugs into the country, how 
would do you it? Would you turn your-
self into the Border Patrol or would 
you try to sneak across? Which is why, 
right now, we believe, there are many 
more illegal drugs, including fentanyl, 
coming into the country now than 
there were in the past. 
There are less drugs being con-
fiscated, way less drugs being con-
fiscated, and for the same reason. If the 
Border Patrol is not guarding the bor-
der, more people sneak across with the 
drugs and less people are caught. 
So, in any event, that by itself is 
enough that should just alarm the peo-
ple of this body, as well as the Amer-
ican public is saying, what is going on,

from 11,000 2 years ago to 63,000 a year 
ago, to 153,000 today. 
We also want to talk, like I did, 
about the number of drugs. When I got 
this job, which seems just like yester-
day, but it was 7 years ago, there were 
about 47,000 Americans who died every 
year of illegal drugs, and that was a big 
number. 
All of us politicians were supposed to 
say something and have a plan because 
what are we going to do? 47,000 Ameri-
cans dying every year of illegal drugs. 
And we passed more money, and we 
passed things out for treatment. 
And 7 years later, we have gone from 
47,000—by way of comparison, 57,000 
Americans died in the Vietnam war— 
we are now at 110,000, 110,000 people. 
For people my age, that is twice as 
many as the number of people, combat 
troops, that died Vietnam in a 12-year 
period. That was 57,000; protests in the 
street. We have got to stop this. 57,000 
Americans have died. 
Now, every year, 110,000 Americans 
are dying of illegal drug overdoses. 
What should we be doing? 
We could use more technology, so 
when people do come in and try to 
sneak in drugs, where the Border Pa-
trol is monitoring things, they are 
more likely to catch the drugs. 
I personally love the dogs. The dogs 
do a tremendous job at the border when 
people try to sneak across the San 
Diego sector and put fentanyl or drugs 
in a truck or a car, those are things 
that should be unquestionably in the 
budget. And if we would do that sort of 
thing, maybe it would put a little bit of 
brakes on the illegal drugs. 
Another thing we learned down at 
the border is the increasing variety of 
countries that are coming here. You 
have to ask yourselves why that is. 
Two Monday nights ago, I was at the 
border and we saw two groups of people 
in a relatively short period of time 
come into Yuma; groups of 70 or 80 peo-
ple. Where are they from? 
I think the average American thinks 
Cuba, Guatemala. No, from Peru, Co-
lombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Bangladesh, 
India, 
Uzbekistan. 
Okay, 
from 
all 
around the globe. 
Now, you might say why are people 
coming here from all around the globe? 
Well, first of all, why would anybody 
not like to be an American? 
But secondly, because the Mexican 
drug cartels, I am told, and have been 
told by every Border Patrol agent in 
every sector over the last year and a 
half, the Mexican drug cartels are right 
now making more money smuggling 
people across the border than drugs 
across the border. 
b 1915 
That is because, depending upon 
where you are coming from, $8,000, 
$9,000, $15,000—I am told, from Asia, 
$20,000—to get somebody in here. When 
you are making that kind of money, it 
is not surprising that they would be 
educating the whole world that now is 
the time to come into the United 
States. 
They have pointed out to me that 
these are not necessarily poor, des-
perate people, by the standards of their 
home countries. In fact, some of them 
appear to the Border Patrol to be rel-
atively well-off. They do not look poor-
ly fed. The Border Patrol estimates 90 
to 95 percent of them have a cell phone. 
There was a time in the not-too-distant 
past that that meant you were well-off. 
I am not good at judging clothes, but 
we are told that the shoes or the purses 
or whatever, the Border Patrol can 
tell, are a sign that these are not nec-
essarily poor people. They are just peo-
ple who realize they are better off in 
the United States than in their home 
country. 
There are a lot of Cubans coming 
across. A lot of these Cubans, even 
though they are saying they want asy-
lum from Cuba, they have thrown away 
their identification from Chile or Co-
lombia or wherever. They had fled 
Cuba to Chile, and now the word is out: 
Now is the time to come to the United 
States. 
They aren’t fleeing oppression in 
Chile. They are just coming to the 
United States because it is better off. 
Why wouldn’t they? 
But we have to realize that if we are 
going to continue with the current pol-
icy, an unlimited number of people 
would come here. Look around the 
globe. China, Indonesia, Brazil, large 
countries, almost everybody would be 
better off in America, which is why 
tens of thousands, hundreds of thou-
sands from some of these countries, are 
going to continue to flow here unless 
we begin to put the brakes on the cur-
rent policies. 
One other thing of interest we found. 
When these got-aways sneak across the 
southern border in Arizona, they will 
pay young people, kids, over $1,000 to 
come up and get them at the border 
and drive them to Phoenix, which is 
kind of interesting, isn’t it? 
Another thing for people back home 
to remember, if they think the current 
hodgepodge system is humanitarian, is 
the day we were in the San Diego sec-
tor, where you have a wall that goes, I 
am guessing, maybe a hundred yards 
into the Pacific Ocean, they found two 
people on the American side had 
drowned trying to get around there. 
I guess the ocean is a lot more dif-
ficult to get around than people think. 
They look out a hundred yards, and 
they figure that they can swim out 
there, that they can get around. They 
can’t get around, or they get in a boat 
that is not as seaworthy as they think 
it is. So, many people drown in the 
ocean trying to come here. 
The Mexican Government tells us 
that more people wind up washing up 
on the Mexican shore than on the 
American shore because their boats 
sink before they even get around to the 
American side. 
Of course, it is not just in the ocean 
that you see people die coming here. In 
the Arizona sector, it is not unusual to 
have people dehydrate to death in the 
summer sun. Americans, good-natured 
as we are, sometimes put out gallons of 
water in the desert, hoping that people 
who are dehydrating to death find the 
gallons of water. But frequently, they 
don’t. 
As you get further down the border, 
in the past, when I have been on the 
Rio Grande border, it is, again, not un-
usual to have people drown in the Rio 
Grande. It looks like a shallow river, 
and they don’t realize the undertow 
and that sort of thing, and they wind 
up dying. 
Women who try to come across, par-
ticularly women who try to be with 
groups that are got-aways and sneak 
across, the sheriff of one of the coun-
ties—and this is another number I find 
hard to believe, but it is the sheriff. He 
tells me, one of the sheriffs in Arizona, 
that he believes 80 percent of the 
women who are part of these groups 
that try to be got-aways and sneak 
across without checking at the Border 
Patrol, 80 percent are raped. Isn’t that 
kind of a horrible thing? 
But the word is out around the world: 
Now is the time to come across. And 
that is what happens. 
In any event, I encourage the Amer-
ican public and encourage people of all 
parties here, and especially the Biden 
administration, to get them going a 
little, to realize, right now, it is 150,000 
people a month. If they change the pol-
icy in June like they are talking, the 
Border Patrol believes that you are 
going to be working your way up to, 
like, 400,000, 500,000 a month, which, 
again, I find hard to believe, but you 
have to figure the Border Patrol are 
the experts on this sort of thing. 
It shouldn’t be that difficult to find a 
good system, and no other country 
would stand for this. I made the point 
about a year ago, and it may be tardy 
now, but I do think to allow unlimited 
people to come here makes the Amer-
ican Government and the current ad-
ministration look weak. 
I think as far as what happened to 
Ukraine and what may happen some-
day in Taiwan, when they look at the 
United States and say we have a Presi-
dent who is allowing 150,000 people a 
month to come here and doing nothing 
about it, I just think it screams Amer-
ica is no longer the leader in the world. 
In any event, I hope steps are taken. 
Hire more Border Patrol, hire more 
dogs, complete the wall, which would 
be a big step in the right direction as 
well, and go back to the policy of al-
lowing people to be held on the Mexi-
can side of the border prior to coming 
across here because people are not 
going to pay the Mexican drug cartels 
$10,000 or $15,000 to sit on the Mexican 
side of the border and hope that the 
hearing goes their way. 
Again, to emphasize the number, 2 
years ago, 11,000 a month; now, 152,000 
a month. People shrug their shoulders 
and say: What could we do? Well, we 
could adopt the policies we had when 
we were at 11,000 a month. That would 
be a good start. In any event, this is

what we learned on the border 2 weeks 
ago. 
Earlier 
today, 
we 
addressed 
the 
Ukraine situation, and I am contin-
ually disappointed in the media in this 
country for not addressing the Ukrain-
ian famine of 90 years ago. I don’t 
know how you can report on this war 
between Ukraine and Russia and not 
talk about, depending on who is doing 
the counting, the 5 to 10 million 
Ukrainians who were starved to death 
by the Communist governments in 1932. 
Even, at the time, the American 
press was shameless. We were in a situ-
ation in which a reporter for The New 
York Times, Walter Duranty, hid this 
great starvation from the American 
public and the Western world. 
As a result, without the West being 
able to weigh in or the world being able 
to weigh in, about 5 to 15 million peo-
ple, I am guessing more like 5 or 6 mil-
lion, starved to death. 
When we talk about why the Ukrain-
ians are fighting so hard, how can you 
talk about that without talking about 
the history between the then-Com-
munist Government of Russia and also 
the communists, quite frankly, who 
ran Ukraine at the time and the civil-
ians who wound up starving to death? 
You read first-person accounts of all 
the people dying. You realize how, 90 
years later, that must still be some-
thing that everybody learns about in 
that country. 
Like I said, one of the great dis-
appointments is the mainstream media 
has not talked about it. Why don’t they 
talk about it? 
Is it because they didn’t talk about it 
in 1932 because their reporters were so 
left of left, they apparently didn’t want 
to embarrass the Soviet Union with 
what was going on? Is it because our 
reporters today are so left of left and 
so in love with leftwing governments 
that they don’t want to embarrass 
them by pointing out the mass murder 
that they were responsible for 90 years 
ago? 
In any event, I encourage all Ameri-
cans to Google the Ukrainian famine 
and read some first-person accounts of 
what was going on down there. I en-
courage any members of the media who 
sometimes, I think, spend time on 
nonissues to educate the American 
public a little bit on what was going on 
between Russia and Ukraine 90 years 
ago this year. 
Now, the final issue which we have to 
talk about, and I think is the most im-
portant issue of America under normal 
circumstances when our country is not 
being overrun at the southern border 
and when we are not facing world war 
in Ukraine, and that is the continuous 
policy, encouraged more by the Biden 
administration in their Build Back 
Better bill, another thing he is doing, 
to have a means-tested welfare pro-
gram that discourages work and en-
courages the breakdown of the family. 
Understand the qualifications, and 
there are over 80 means-tested pro-
grams, some of them more well-known. 
One is food stamps; TANF, which is a 
cash grant; public housing; earned in-
come tax credit; Pell grants. All of 
these programs are based on whether 
or not you are considered to be in pov-
erty. 
If you have a married couple in which 
both are working or one has a some-
what middle-class job, you will not be 
considered in poverty, and you are not 
eligible for these programs. But if you 
have a single parent who is not work-
ing or working a little bit, the govern-
ment considers you in poverty. 
Once you are in poverty, food stamps, 
TANF, public housing, which is a big 
one—I think they underestimate the 
draw that public housing has, and I can 
talk about that in a second. The earned 
income tax credit can easily be a check 
of $6,000, $7,000, or $8,000 coming in 
every tax season. Pell grants, the op-
portunity 
for 
almost 
free 
college, 
something else that the average person 
doesn’t get, but if you adopt that life-
style, you get it. 
It is not surprising that we have had, 
going back 70 years, such a shift in the 
way we raise children in this country, 
a shift from almost uniformly a mom 
and dad at home to a much higher per-
centage all the time without a dad. 
I realize there are a few people out 
there who don’t want a dad at home. I 
will mention one more time Black 
Lives Matter. On their website, when 
they were riding high about a year and 
a half ago, they were against the tradi-
tional nuclear family. Of course, the 
Marxists, Karl Marx himself, did not 
like the traditional family. 
People sometimes think this has 
been a coincidence in which we have 
had a breakdown of the traditional 
family. In part, we have to remember 
that there are people who outright 
don’t like the family. 
In any event, I encourage this body, 
before they pass any more significant 
legislation, and I encourage the Repub-
licans, if they ever get back in the ma-
jority again, to look at these programs 
and see, in a country in which we try 
to treat everybody equally, why we 
have these programs that, in essence, 
take money from the traditional fam-
ily and send it to the nonnuclear fam-
ily. 
I have been approached by women a 
few times in my district wondering 
why their children have to take out big 
student loans and go 30 or 40 grand in 
debt, or maybe they had a sister with-
out a husband in the house, and they 
get free college. I really can’t under-
stand why we are so prejudiced against 
the nuclear family. 
But that is what we are in America 
today, and there is a lot of talk about 
equity or equality. We should talk 
about the degree to which we discrimi-
nate against nuclear families in this 
society and see what we can do about 
trying to put people more on an equi-
table basis. 
That would be a good thing for the 
Republican Party to work on if they 
ever do get the majority back, and I 
hope they do. I think they will. 
In any event, I would also hope our 
conservative think tanks, our conserv-
ative groups, do more to publicize the 
prejudice that is going on in this soci-
ety against the nuclear family. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe some fine Con-
gressmen behind me are anxious to 
speak. I yield back the balance of my 
time.

joined here this evening by some of the 
other members of the Freedom Caucus 
to talk about what everybody is talk-
ing about or one of the things every-
body is talking about, which is the un-
mitigated disaster, the calamity, the 
crisis at the United States southern 
border. 
Today, Secretary Mayorkas was here 
on the Hill, and I think the term he 
used was that the border was effec-
tively managed. Effectively managed, 
Mr. Speaker. I think maybe we are ask-
ing the wrong question because effec-
tively managed seems very different in 
the minds of many Americans than ap-
parently it does to the good Secretary. 
It seems to me that just looking at 
the numbers—and I think we often-
times talk too much in numbers—the 
toll is in real human lives, but we do 
need to talk about the numbers a little 
bit just to emphasize the scale. 
Effectively managed. For us, for 
Americans, we think we should have a 
sovereign country that has a border 
where the United States of America de-
termines who gets to walk across the 
border and what the process is. Of 
course, that is obliterated right now. 
That is totally gone. 
I think when the Secretary says that 
it is being effectively managed, I think 
that is in terms of the new left’s 
version of the border of America, which 
is to allow it to be as open as possible, 
to be violated as many times as pos-
sible, and to make as efficient as pos-
sible those violations on a daily basis. 
In other words, let’s move across as 
many people as we can, legally or ille-
gally, without regard to the safety of 
the country, without regard to the 
health of the country, without regard 
to the financial circumstances of the 
country. All of that stuff is out, quite 
honestly, without regard to the senti-
ment of the American people whom we 
all serve—our bosses. 
In his mind, apparently, it is effec-
tively being managed. Every time we 
allocate more money, the charge is it 
is to more effectively manage or secure 
our border. Ladies and gentlemen and 
Mr. Speaker, what that means under 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Mayorkas and the left’s reign across

April 27, 2022 
America right now is that they are effi-
ciently—and becoming more efficient 
at it—moving illegal aliens into our 
country, into our neighborhoods. 
Maybe you say, Well, look, these are 
just people that are looking for a bet-
ter life. Many of them are, that is true. 
We don’t hate anybody. Every one of us 
wants to help. What comes with that? 
What comes with the wide open border? 
Mr. Speaker, what comes with it is a 
record number of fentanyl overdoses, 
the leading cause of death for young 
people between the ages of 18 and 42 in 
America today. That is what comes 
across the border. MS–13 and the crimi-
nal element. 
It is said that we need a humane pol-
icy. This is a humane policy? Mr. 
Speaker, I don’t know whether you 
know this or not, but, unfortunately, a 
young National Guardsman died while 
trying to help people that were trying 
to cross the river, they seemed like 
they were struggling so he jumped in 
to help them. He lost his life. 
I don’t know if it is true, but it is re-
ported that after those people came 
across or got across they were arrested 
for drug trafficking. When they found 
the young servicemember’s body, it 
was with another person who happened 
to be an illegal alien that was trying to 
cross. Of course, it is not reported, but 
I think there are literally hundreds and 
hundreds of dead illegal aliens that 
have tried to cross the border in the 
last 14 months. How humane is that? 
Human trafficking. We have passed 
numerous bills in this House of Rep-
resentatives, Mr. Speaker, even since 
you have been here, about human traf-
ficking. Yet, the taxpayers of our coun-
try are forced to finance the largest 
human trafficking operation the world 
has ever known. These are the same 
people paying the taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, I went to the grocery 
store before I came here, I bought, I 
think, seven items: a loaf of bread, 
cheese, normal things—two little bags. 
It was $50. These are the same people 
that are paying $50 for the groceries for 
two little bags that have got to pay for 
all of this. 
I have a regular-size car, it has about 
292,000 miles on it, and it was $75 to fill 
it up. We are telling them, under pen-
alty of law, unless you pay for this you 
will go to jail, and you will lose your 
house if you don’t pay your taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, this is unconscionable. 
We are currently at 8,000 per day. 
There are 8,000 illegal crossings per 
day. We are here to talk about title 42, 
which is only going to at least double 
that—and that is according to this De-
partment of Homeland Security. Dou-
ble that. 
There is already a crisis at 8,000 per 
day. I come from a town of about 2,000 
people. Every day, four times that 
many people come across the border il-
legally and reside in the United States 
and take away and steal our opportuni-
ties. They steal the American oppor-
tunity for education, for safe streets, 
for a starting job—your first job out of 
high school. All of that is stolen. 
Mr. Speaker, I would contend that 
Secretary Mayorkas should be arrested 
for violating the law because indeed he 
is violating the law. He is not enforcing 
the law. He swore an oath. It is in the 
law. People say we need new laws. Mr. 
Speaker, even members of your party 
are saying we need new legislation to 
combat this. 
What is any legislation going to mat-
ter if the administration refuses to 
faithfully execute the laws of this 
land? It is listed right in the Constitu-
tion, Mr. Speaker. It is right in there. 
It is right in there. Faithfully execute 
the laws of the land. Yet, we have a 
President and we have a Secretary that 
refuse to do it. 
Mr. Speaker, I am joined here by my 
great colleagues. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate Mr. PERRY’s leadership on 
this issue. 
Secretary 
Mayorkas’ 
testimony 
today in a hearing was that the border 
is secure. You have to ask yourself: 
What would an unsecure border look 
like as defined by this administration, 
by this President, and by this Demo-
crat majority? 
I wish the Democrats were with us 
across the aisle tonight to try to de-
fend the indefensible. I wish the Demo-
crats were here tonight to tell the 
American people why they are inten-
tionally, willfully, and purposefully fa-
cilitating this border invasion. 
Many of us thought the President 
would open the border, would rescind 
the policies that were making the bor-
der secure under the Trump Presi-
dency, but most of us probably under-
estimated how effective he would be in 
facilitating the invasion at the border, 
to your point, some 7,000 to 8,000 a day 
now that we encounter, that we appre-
hend before we bus or fly them into the 
interior of the country. 
Never in the history of the country 
has our own President done more to in-
tentionally harm the United States 
than what this President has done in 
his first 16 months. If we secured the 
border now—if today we secured the 
border, we have done irreparable, un-
told harm to the country that will only 
be shown in the next days, weeks, 
months, and years ahead. 
We have got 2,000 criminal aliens a 
day evading apprehension. Think about 
this. This administration’s policies are 
welcoming these illegal aliens into the 
country, giving them their free phones, 
free transportation, free education, so-
cial services, and healthcare, and re-
leasing them into the interior of the 
country wherever they want to go 
without even a day to appear in court. 
Why are the 2,000 a day avoiding ap-
prehension? Those are the ones with 
the criminal backgrounds, the terrorist 
ties, trafficking drugs, trafficking hu-
mans, children, and what have you, 
who don’t want to be captured, don’t 
want to be apprehended. 
This administration admits that 42 
on the terrorist watch list have been 
caught in the last year coming into the 
country out of the 2 million plus who 
they apprehended. What about the 
700,000 in the first 15 months that they 
didn’t apprehend? How many of those 
have terrorist ties? We have no idea. 
The country will find out, sadly, in the 
days, the weeks, and the months ahead. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the good gentleman. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I, 
likewise, am deeply grateful for your 
leadership in putting this together. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a call for our en-
tire country to come together. This 
should 
not 
be 
something 
that 
is 
wrapped up in partisan politics. We are 
talking about securing our border. Se-
curing our border. Right now, we have 
a discharge petition to save title 42, 
unfortunately Democrats are refusing 
to support that discharge. 
I am calling on them tonight to come 
on, to sign on to the discharge and let’s 
save title 42. This is in defense of our 
country and in defense of our national 
security. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. HICE, could you tell 
us how many have signed? How many 
Democrats have signed the discharge? 
The discharge brings the bill to the 
floor. How many have signed? 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
there are zero, to my knowledge. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, there are 
Democrats out there talking about the 
border crisis and saying we have to fix 
it, yet they won’t sign it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
am calling on them tonight—we are 
calling on them tonight to sign it. This 
is a national security issue. What is 
the problem here? It makes no sense to 
me. We have no Democrats that have 
signed on to this discharge petition. 
As you mentioned, we are now watch-
ing—and Mr. GOOD from Virginia as 
well—we are watching now the num-
bers soar to the point of more than 
doubling the maximum that we have 
had in the years past. In year 2000 we 
had 220,000 apprehensions, and now it is 
going to soar over 500,000. We are sit-
ting back here in the people’s House 
doing nothing about it. We are respon-
sible as the governing body of this 
country to defend our borders. 
Right now, because of the surge that 
is taking place, Mr. Speaker, we are 
having Customs and Border Protection 
agents who are now being moved to 
process these illegal individuals. There 
are ICE agents who are being moved to 
process 
these 
individuals 
coming 
across our border. 
The U.S. Marshals are leaving the 
various places around this country 
where they are serving to go to our 
southern border to try to help with this 
crisis that has no business even being a 
crisis. Now, we have all these agents 
who are not even doing their job be-
cause they are processing illegal indi-
viduals coming across into this coun-
try. 
Now, we hear that DHS is calling on 
other Federal Government agencies to

provide doctors. I don’t know about 
you, but I don’t know of many agencies 
in the Federal Government who have 
doctors. Where are they going to come 
from? Perhaps the Department of De-
fense. Certainly, there are some doc-
tors in the VA. 
Let’s say those doctors go to the 
southern border, then what happens to 
our veterans who now are lacking doc-
tors to serve them? None of this makes 
any sense, and it leaves our entire 
country in a very vulnerable position. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just say that 
border security is an enormous compo-
nent to national security, and if we do 
not have secure borders, we do not 
have a secure Nation. I am calling on 
our Democrats today to sign on to the 
discharge petition. Let’s save title 42. 
For crying out loud, let’s defend our 
borders and get over the partisan poli-
tics and do the right thing and defend 
our borders. 
b 1945 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for leading us on this 
topic, once again, because this is such 
an important topic to get out to the 
American people. Just listening to the 
gentleman from Georgia speak about 
this being a national security crisis, 
that is exactly what this is. We are not 
a secure nation without secure borders. 
I live in Colorado, and my State is a 
border State right now with all of the 
illegal aliens. We are up to 2.5 million 
who have been apprehended at the 
southern border, not including the 
700,000 gotaways that went past CBP 
and were not apprehended, probably be-
cause they did not want to come into 
contact with CBP. 
Who knows what kind of history they 
have? 
Just like Congressman GOOD spoke 
on, we don’t know who is coming 
across our southern border. It is esti-
mated that if this pace keeps up under 
Biden’s tenure, we will have 8 to 10 mil-
lion illegal aliens in our country by the 
time he leaves office. 
This is absolutely absurd. 
And now what? 
I serve on the Budget Committee; 
and everyone is wanting more money 
right now, more money from the Amer-
ican taxpayer. We can’t say where the 
money went in Afghanistan. We can’t 
talk about the $86 billion in weaponry 
and equipment that was left behind. 
The southern border has millions of 
dollars being spent each and every day 
on a border wall that is not being built. 
Secretary Mayorkas was here today 
testifying in front of this body, and he 
says that there are millions of dollars 
being spent on this wall that is not 
being built, and they want more 
money—not to secure the southern bor-
der though, but to process and release 
more quickly. 
This is not what we need to be spend-
ing the American taxpayer dollars on. 
Customs and Border Patrol agents are 
not travel agents. Secretary Mayorkas 
needs to be held accountable for what 
is going on. 
I just want to say one thing, he did 
mention that it is Congress’ responsi-
bility to fix what is happening at the 
southern border. Well, we want to do 
that. We want to be a part of the solu-
tion. We want to secure our border, 
stop the human trafficking, and stop 
the flow of fentanyl that is coming into 
our country killing record amounts of 
Americans. We want this to end. We 
want our Nation secure. 
That is why we have the title 42 dis-
charge petition, to force a vote on the 
House floor under Speaker PELOSI’s 
House of Representatives where she 
won’t voluntarily bring that up. We 
want to be a part of the solution. 
I am proud to be serving with Mem-
bers here speaking about this and in-
forming the American citizens back 
home, and I thank the chairman for 
doing this tonight. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Colorado for her 
remarks. 
Mrs. BOEBERT talked about the wall 
that is not being built; unfulfilled con-
tracts, Mr. Speaker, costing, as Sec-
retary Mayorkas told us today, $72 mil-
lion, $72 million to not build the border 
wall, to not honor the contracts that 
the United States has made with the 
contractors, $72 million. Yet they are 
asking for more money. 
Mrs. BOEBERT also knows that even 
though we have contracted for more 
beds to deal with the influx, we actu-
ally leave them empty while we pay 
NGOs—nongovernmental 
organiza-
tions—to put these people up in hotels. 
And I will remind you, Mr. Speaker, 
that the folks whom I serve—my 
bosses—can barely afford their gro-
ceries or their gas, but they are forced 
to pay for this. We will talk about na-
tional security because border security 
is national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, this issue 
is so important, and I thank the chair-
man for putting this together because 
this is the message that we need to 
continue to speak about. 
Being from south Texas, our district 
sees every week the effects of this and 
has for years. I have met the young 
women who have been abused. I have 
been to the ranchers who have found 
rape trees on their properties. We have 
seen now throughout the Nation of the 
effects of the drugs that are pouring 
into our community. Under the Trump 
administration we had actually seen a 
decrease in drug overdoses in our coun-
try for the first time in a long time. 
Now we know that fentanyl is the num-
ber one killer of young people in our 
country. 
All this is because this administra-
tion has chosen, instead of partnering 
with communities to protect our bor-
der, to be the last mile delivery system 
for the cartels. And so whatever dollars 
we send them, they repurpose. Instead 
of using them for securing our border 
and to doing the things we sent them 
to do, they have retasked the individ-
uals, as has been mentioned, but they 
turn them into the last mile delivery 
system for the cartels. So we are aiding 
and abetting cartels to profit hundreds 
of millions of dollars constantly and 
continually. 
What this does is not only desta-
bilizing for our country, we know of 
community members, of course, all of 
us, whose families have been affected 
by the drug epidemic in our country; 
we know of crime going up in cities; we 
know of communities burdened with 
hospitals and schools having to figure 
out how to deal with this administra-
tion who will not work with them or 
let them know when midnight drops 
are being made in their community and 
the like. 
I talked to a farmer today—not only 
do farmers deal with the migrant traf-
fic through their crops and such—about 
the cartel. Basically the cartel controls 
everything. They have the operational 
control on the southern side of the bor-
der, so everything illicit and not comes 
across. So in the ag industry, for exam-
ple, a lot of cows will start in Mexico 
and come to a feedyard in the United 
States before they make it to market. 
Well, to cross into the United States 
they are having to pay cartels a couple 
thousand dollars to make it through 
their property, and that is what we 
would consider the legal trade, the 
proper trade; not to mention the illicit 
drugs and the human trafficking that 
is going on. We continue to allow this 
to happen because of the Biden admin-
istration. 
Now, if you think of this, if we were 
to ask the cartels to design a border 
policy for the United States, it would 
look very much like the border policy 
we have now because, frankly, they 
don’t want open borders. What they 
want is just a shred—an illusion—of se-
curity so that they can continue to 
profit off of getting people and getting 
drugs into the United States of Amer-
ica. 
So we have got to stop this as a coun-
try. We cannot continue to aid and 
abet cartels to do their illegal and il-
licit activity. We cannot continue to 
allow a narco-state to develop on our 
southern border and is now working its 
way into our country. This is ridicu-
lous. 
When I am trying to explain this to 
people back home, people back home in 
Texas ask me: What does the Biden ad-
ministration not get? 
What do they not get? 
How bad does it have to get before 
they understand it? 
We saw it today with Secretary 
Mayorkas saying that we are effec-
tively managing the border. 
I have to explain to Texans that this 
administration simply has different 
goals than you do. We think border se-
curity; they think what can we do to 
aid and abet cartels.

April 27, 2022 
This is tragic. It has to stop. We have 
a title 42 discharge resolution with 211 
Republicans on it. We need seven 
Democrats. There has been a lot of lip 
service as we get close to election time 
about supporting title 42. Put your 
name on the line. We only need seven 
of you to stand up. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
had a constituent say to me a couple 
weeks ago: Nothing this Democratic 
Party is doing makes sense unless they 
hate the country. 
Carry these policies to its logical 
conclusion. 
As 
Congresswoman 
BOEBERT said, they are on track for 10 
million illegal border crossings in this 
President’s first and only term, I hope. 
Ten million, apparently, is not a 
problem. We cannot get one Democrat. 
We cannot get one Democrat. 
Where are the Democrats? 
Mr. Speaker, do you want to know 
why they are going to lose the major-
ity? 
It is because of what Congressman 
CLOUD just said. 
Carry these policies to its logical 
conclusion. Ten million is not scary to 
them. 
What if it was 100 million? 
What if it was 1 billion? 
We have got 7 billion people in the 
world who don’t live in the United 
States. 
How many of them would come here 
if they could? 
We have put out the sign, the Demo-
cratic majority and the administra-
tion, come. If you want to come in the 
country, come now. The border is open. 
We are welcoming as fast as we can, as 
much harm as we can do before the 
election in November, before 2 years 
from now in 2024 when the Presidential 
election changes. Carry it to its con-
clusion. 
Is there any number that would con-
cern the Democrat majority? 
Is there any number where we could 
get Democrats to sign on to this? 
Nothing they are doing makes sense 
unless they hate the country. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, national 
security is community security. We are 
here to talk about the border in gen-
eral, but certainly title 42, 8,000 a day 
right now but soon to be double that, 
maybe more than double that, 8,000 a 
day. So national security is commu-
nity security. 
I was watching a report on the tele-
vision of a lady in New York—I think 
it was New York—she got stabbed in 
the neck and the face over 50 times— 
over 50 times—murdered. And in the 
press conference the press asked for the 
person—the perpetrator—whom they 
had caught his immigration status. 
And law enforcement said: We are not 
going to get into that. We are not 
going to get into that. 
There is a Texas guardsman, a young 
man who would be alive right now. 
There is a lady who was stabbed in the 
neck and the face 50 some times who 
would be alive right now because this 
administration, the left, the Demo-
cratic Party, unfortunately, appar-
ently doesn’t care about border secu-
rity, community security, title 42, pre-
serving the American Dream, and safe-
guarding the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to lose a 
great Member of Congress here at the 
end of this session. I often affection-
ately refer to him as the closer because 
everybody is gone from Washington, 
D.C., but Louie is still standing there 
telling the country what is happening. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the general from Pennsyl-
vania, for yielding. 
This is so serious. While Homeland 
Security was having a hearing with 
Secretary Mayorkas, we were having a 
hearing in our Crime, Terrorism and 
Homeland Security Subcommittee, and 
we were hearing from victims of human 
and sex trafficking and hearing about 
victims of human and sex trafficking. 
Mr. Speaker, how callous does a per-
son have to be to not be moved by 
young adults saying: My childhood was 
one of being constantly raped, con-
stantly beaten, and constantly forced 
to do terrible things, that was my 
childhood because I had been sold into 
trafficking, human and sex trafficking. 
Now, one said that she had used the 
same visa that others had used before— 
the very same visa. We are not check-
ing visas very carefully. Homeland se-
curity, that is their job. 
But another came across our south-
ern border, and, of course, our Chair-
man NADLER really grilled in and fo-
cused on and had him say that the 
number 
one 
problem 
he 
had 
was 
homophobia of people in the U.S. But 
as I pointed out: You are being raped 
constantly over and over, it doesn’t 
sound like homophobia is your big 
problem. 
It is not having a Department of 
Homeland Security that is keeping the 
homeland secure. 
This can’t continue. For heaven’s 
sake, we are losing this country, and as 
we are losing it, it is absolutely im-
moral to turn a blind eye to these chil-
dren that are being sex trafficked be-
cause we won’t secure our border, and 
we won’t have an administration that 
will keep the oaths they made to de-
fend, protect, serve this country, and 
serve the Constitution. 
It is a sort of fiduciary duty they 
have to this country, to the people in 
this country; and by the relationship 
with our neighbors, to other countries 
around us like Mexico for heaven’s 
sake. It is outrageous what is going on, 
and people’s lives are being destroyed. 
As the country is being destroyed, lives 
are being destroyed. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for claiming this time tonight. It is a 
huge problem. If we don’t get this 
fixed, we have no moral right to exist; 
and if America doesn’t exist, then 
there is no freedom in the world. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend, Louie, for his comments. 
We have 2 minutes remaining by my 
clock here; is that right, Mr. Speaker? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
has 
1 
minute remaining. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues from the House Freedom 
Caucus. They are always the toughest 
and most courageous people in Con-
gress who are willing to do the uncom-
fortable things. They are fighting to 
take action, not just rhetoric, but to 
take action. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT) 
to close us out. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, so 
many times we are accused of being 
callous and heartless toward the people 
who are coming across our border. But 
I attended a naturalization ceremony 
in my district, and it was one of the 
most beautiful things I have ever expe-
rienced. I saw 41 true new Americans. 
They held in their hand the American 
flag. Tears streamed down their faces. 
They invested their heart, their soul, 
their resources, and their minds be-
cause they know they have what it 
takes to do this the right way and 
make this a more perfect Union. 
I saw the conviction that that flag 
right there, to them, is the one uni-
versal symbol for liberty and justice 
for all. 
There is a right way to do this, and 
we have to keep America free and se-
cure so people can come and live the 
American Dream. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for yielding to me tonight. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded again to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the 
President.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, author of liberty, on 
this Holocaust Remembrance Day, in-
spire us to cultivate the eternal vigi-
lance that pays the price for freedom. 
Lord, use our lawmakers to ensure 
that the challenge ‘‘never again’’ is 
transformed from mere words into cre-
ative actions. Remind us of the words 
of Elie Wiesel, who said: 
To forget the victims means to kill them a 
second time. 
O, God, our help in ages past, our 
hope for years to come, still be our 
guard while troubles last and our eter-
nal home. 
And, Lord, we thank You for the life 
and impact of former Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
earlier today, leaders past and present 
from around the world joined together 
to celebrate the life of Madeleine 
Albright. While Secretary Albright 
may have been small in stature, she 
was a titan in American history; she 
was one of a kind and first of a kind; a 
mentor; a natural leader as well as a 
mother and grandmother. Her bril-
liance and sharp wit made her a formi-
dable presence on the world stage, and 
her story inspired women and girls all 
across the globe. 
Today was a wonderful celebration of 
her life. My thoughts are with Sec-
retary Albright’s family as our Nation 
remembers her life and her great leg-
acy. 
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
Now, Madam President, on the FTC, 
as we have done all along this year, 
Democrats are continuing to focus on 
lowering prices for the American peo-
ple. Yesterday, I met with Speaker 
PELOSI to discuss how both Chambers 
can work together to address the ter-
rible burden of rising gas prices. 
It is one of the most vexing issues for 
the American people. The disturbances 
from the pandemic and the war in 
Ukraine have caused gas prices to 
spike, and working Americans are 
hurting. But do you know who is not 
hurting? The largest oil and gas com-
panies, which reported over $205 billion 
in profits in 2021 even while Americans 
pay more at the pump. Solving this 
issue is a top priority for Democrats— 
a top priority. Unfortunately, the 
other side seems content with bemoan-
ing rising costs day after day, without 
expressing any interest in actually of-
fering solutions to the problem. 
Senate Democrats are actually work-
ing to solve the problem, and we will

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2174 
April 27, 2022 
continue talks with our House col-
leagues on legislation that can bring 
gas prices down. There are several op-
tions we can take. 
Now, there is a growing consensus 
that the Federal Government—espe-
cially the FTC—should investigate pos-
sible price gouging and price manipula-
tion, market manipulation, that might 
be happening among the largest oil and 
gas companies in the country. This is 
one step we are working on out of 
many. 
Of course, any solution involving the 
FTC requires that the FTC have full 
membership to begin with, so we are 
also going to keep working to confirm 
Mr. Bedoya as the fifth FTC Commis-
sioner to break the 2–2 deadlock that 
has lasted for over a year. 
It is important to note that Repub-
licans unanimously are not voting for 
Mr. Bedoya, and that has paralyzed the 
FTC, even though its leadership would 
love to go after the price gouging and 
market manipulation. We have a few 
Members absent because of health 
issues this week, but I want to be clear 
that health issues will not deter us 
from getting Mr. Bedoya and other im-
portant nominees, like Lisa Cook, con-
firmed. 
I urge any Republican who is truly 
worried about rising gas prices to drop 
their senseless objection to getting Mr. 
Bedoya confirmed. It seems it is only 
covering up for the oil companies and 
preventing a really sharp, piercing in-
vestigation of market manipulation 
and price gouging. There is something 
deeply wrong about seeing the largest 
oil companies, while raking record 
profits, asking Americans to pay more 
at the pump. That is why we need an 
FTC with full membership, so it can 
look under the hood of America’s en-
ergy sector and drill down into why Big 
Oil is pumping out record profits as 
consumers struggle. 
Again, I repeat to my Republican col-
leagues: If you care about lowering gas 
prices and care about looking at what 
the large companies—oligopolies—are 
doing, join us in voting Mr. Bedoya on 
the FTC. A vote against him is a vote 
for Big Oil and against the American 
driver and consumer. 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT 
Madam President, now on student 
debt, for over a year, one of my top pri-
orities as majority leader has been urg-
ing President Biden to cancel $50,000 in 
student debt for each student loan bor-
rower. Right now, as discussions con-
tinue within the administration about 
the future of student debt, I again call 
on the President to take action, which 
he can do on his own, and hit the finan-
cial reset button for millions and mil-
lions of Americans. 
President Biden has done the right 
thing by continuing the moratorium on 
student loan payments. His actions 
have saved millions from financial ruin 
during the COVID crisis. But borrowers 
don’t just need their debts paused; they 
need them erased. These extensions 
have been crucial, but borrowers can’t 
indefinitely plan out their financial fu-
tures 3 months at a time with the fear 
hanging over them that payments 
would resume down the line. 
With the flick of a pen, President 
Biden could provide millions upon mil-
lions of student loan borrowers a new 
lease on life. He can do it without con-
gressional action, because we know so 
many of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are opposed to it. He 
can do it without congressional action. 
It is the right thing to do for our 
country. For generations, higher edu-
cation has been a ladder up into get-
ting into the middle class, especially 
for Black, Latino, and Asian Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately, student debt has 
become not a ladder up but an anchor 
down, weighing Americans down. It 
makes it harder for borrowers to start 
a family, to buy a home or a car or live 
with financial independence. 
For borrowers of color, the anxieties 
are magnified, often tenfold. Take this 
for example: The White median bor-
rower would only owe an average of 6 
percent of their student loans 20 years 
after starting college. Meanwhile, the 
median Black borrower would still owe 
a staggering 95 percent of their student 
loan debt in that same time span. 
Imagine being closer to retirement 
than to college and realizing you have 
only made a dent in your student 
loans. Millions of borrowers of color— 
millions more borrowers in general— 
live with this reality. 
Once again, borrowers don’t need 
their debts paused; they need them 
erased. This isn’t just the right thing 
to do for our economy; it is the right 
thing to do for racial equity. I will 
keep urging the President to take this 
important step. 
I will say to my colleagues, I think 
the President is moving in the right di-
rection. My talks with him and the 
staff have been very fruitful over the 
last little while, and I am hopeful that 
he will do the right thing. We are get-
ting closer. We are getting closer. 
UKRAINE AND COVID 
Madam President, on Ukraine and 
COVID funding, in the immediate fu-
ture, there are two different issues that 
demand swift and bipartisan action 
from the U.S. Senate: passing another 
Ukraine supplemental package and ap-
proving another round of COVID fund-
ing. 
In the coming days, the President is 
expected to send to Congress his re-
quest for action on Ukraine. We are 
going to make passing Ukraine funding 
a priority in the Senate, and I expect 
both sides to work together. As we 
have seen over the last 2 months, 
American support has gone a long way 
in helping the Ukrainian people resist 
and even push back against Putin’s 
savage and immoral war, but the fight 
is far from over. 
The Ukrainian people are fighting for 
survival in a contest that is very much 
about 
democracy 
versus 
tyranny. 
There should be no question—no ques-
tion 
whatsoever—about 
which 
side 
America stands on. We have a moral 
obligation—a moral obligation—to give 
the Ukrainian people the tools they 
need for as long as they need them. For 
this reason, I expect both sides to work 
in the same bipartisan way we did a 
few months ago to get the Ukrainian 
supplemental done. 
We also need bipartisan cooperation 
as soon as we can to pass another 
round of COVID health funding. I urge 
my Republican colleagues to work with 
us to pass COVID funding ASAP. It is 
very risky for the health of the Amer-
ican people for Republicans to play po-
litical games at a time when we need 
more health funding. 
Let’s be clear. This is an exceedingly 
time-sensitive priority. According to 
the White House, countries like Japan 
and Vietnam and the Philippines are 
already ahead of the United States in 
placing orders for treatment, for medi-
cations, 
for 
vaccines. 
The 
United 
States is largely unable to follow suit 
simply because Senate Republicans 
have blocked any new round of funding 
required to make these purchases. 
The longer Senate Republicans hold 
out on supporting new COVID funding, 
the greater the risk of other nations 
buying out all of the available supplies 
of vaccines and tests and lifesaving 
therapeutics. If they run out, it will 
take manufacturers months to make 
new doses. 
So, again, to my Republican col-
leagues, work with us to pass COVID 
funding ASAP. Our country can’t af-
ford delays or political games that 
stand in the way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I, along with others, had the oppor-
tunity to say goodbye to Madeleine 
Albright this morning—a truly re-
markable life: first woman Secretary 
of State, a remarkable diplomat, and a 
friend. We had an opportunity to bond 
over an issue I am about to discuss: the 
people of Burma and the plight that 
they have had to endure over the years. 
Regretfully, as her life came to an end, 
things did not go in the right direction 
in Burma—at least not yet. I know she 
would not have given up hope; nor have 
I. 
BURMA 
Madam President, with regard to the 
current situation in Burma, Aung San 
Suu Kyi was handed yet another out-
rageous, sham sentence by the military 
junta in Burma.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2175 
April 27, 2022 
For the past year, the leader of Bur-
ma’s democracy movement and thou-
sands of her fellow citizens have been 
detained while the Tatmadaw, which is 
the army, drags their country violently 
backward. 
The generals responsible for last 
year’s coup have met a groundswell of 
popular protests with brutality. As 
Burma’s diverse ethnic minorities have 
found historic unity in the cause of de-
mocracy, the junta has stoked violence 
and division. 
The Tatmadaw is holding countless 
citizens of Burma in prolonged deten-
tion, along with foreign nationals like 
the 
Australian 
economist 
Sean 
Turnell. Its political prisoners report-
edly include dozens—dozens—of chil-
dren under the age of 15. And its base-
less prosecution of Daw Suu Kyi illus-
trates how long the road ahead is for 
Burma’s democracy advocates. 
The military’s latest ruling against 
my friend is just one in an absurd list 
that could carry a total sentence of up 
to 190 years. 
With every passing day, the junta’s 
ruling generals are showing the world 
exactly what they are afraid of. They 
fear the people of Burma—their unity, 
their resolve, and their devotion to a 
democratic future. I have been proud to 
stand with Burma’s democracy move-
ment throughout my career. I have 
been paying close attention to their 
plight this past year. And I am looking 
forward to hearing soon from the Biden 
administration about their efforts to 
help. What sanctions will the adminis-
tration apply to ratchet up the pres-
sure? What additional support will 
they try to provide to the true rep-
resentatives of the people of Burma? 
What will they do to ensure that res-
toration of democracy in Burma is a 
top priority for the upcoming ASEAN 
Summit? 
The leaders and supporters of this 
brutal coup must be held accountable. 
VIOLENT CRIME 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, last week in my hometown of Lou-
isville, I sat down with law enforce-
ment officials and local leaders to dis-
cuss our skyrocketing rate of violent 
crime. 
The participants came from a wide 
variety of backgrounds, but everybody 
agreed murders, shootings, robberies, 
carjackings, and overdoses are simply 
out of control. Louisville recorded 188 
homicides in 2021, an alltime record. 
Twenty-four of the victims were chil-
dren. 
Just recently an anti-gun, anti-police 
activist made national headlines when 
he tried to assassinate a Jewish Demo-
cratic Louisville mayoral candidate. 
Jefferson County saw more than 500 
drug overdose deaths last year, hun-
dreds more than in years before the 
pandemic. These problems are literally 
overwhelming the city’s coroners. 
One expert I met with said that vio-
lent crime has stolen more years of po-
tential life from Louisville than the 
pandemic. Carjackings are up over 200 
percent in the last 2 years. We now av-
erage more than one carjacking every 
48 hours. Folks on the ground say they 
are also seeing nonfatal shootings and 
gang activity increasing. 
This crime spree is coming from the 
tiny minority of Louisville residents. 
One half of 1 percent of the population 
manages to commit an outright major-
ity of all the city’s violent crime. That 
is possible in large part because many 
are let out back on the street within 
days of their arrests. 
Of course, this isn’t just a Louisville 
problem. We have seen violent crime 
soar nationwide since the far left’s na-
tional anti-police and anti-law enforce-
ment campaign that began back in 
2020. Cities everywhere are under siege. 
Here in Washington, in broad daylight 
just yesterday, there was literally an 
armed robbery right outside the head-
quarters of the FBI. 
Polls show 69 percent of Louisville 
residents oppose—oppose—the ‘‘defund 
the police’’ movement and 66 percent 
want more police in their neighbor-
hoods. But many Democrats are still 
unwilling to openly call for law and 
order in our streets. As a result, police 
officials say their officers feel under 
siege. They are worried politicians will 
not have their back. 
Another huge factor is President 
Biden’s failure to secure our borders. I 
was told at last week’s roundtable that 
every bit of deadly heroin and fentanyl 
in our city streets now comes across 
our southern border. As long as this ad-
ministration neglects to enforce our 
laws, every State becomes a border 
State. 
We need to secure the border and 
stop narcotics flooding our neighbor-
hoods. We need officials at all levels to 
back the blue, crack down on crime, 
and re-establish law and order. 
But the Biden administration gives 
us just the opposite. They nominated 
and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice 
who argued that COVID justified early 
release for every single prisoner in 
Washington, DC. Just yesterday, the 
President issued a giant catalog of par-
dons and commutations, cutting sen-
tences after sentence after sentence, 
particularly for convicted drug crimi-
nals. They never miss an opportunity 
to send the wrong signal. And until 
Federal, State, and local Democrats 
get with the program, innocent people 
in Louisville and across the country 
will continue to suffer. 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID HAUCK 
Madam President, now one final mat-
ter, the institution of the U.S. Con-
gress relies on a whole army of diligent 
and dedicated people who work tire-
lessly behind the scenes. 
Today, it is my pleasure to turn the 
spotlight on one such public servant 
who is retiring after a sterling career. 
David Hauck’s time on Capitol Hill 
started here on the Senate side more 
than 30 years ago. He served as an ele-
vator operator while he finished grad-
uate school. 
Dave thrived and impressed every-
body. Before long, he was named the 
founding director of the Office of Con-
gressional Accessibility Services. This 
is a small team whose work often goes 
unheralded, but goes right to the heart 
of our duties to the American people. 
The OCAS ensures the Capitol Com-
plex is an accessible, welcoming place 
for everyone, including Americans with 
different abilities or disabilities. 
Obviously, there is a physical compo-
nent to this. Dave has worked with the 
architects to honor our historic build-
ings, while at the same time making 
them 
accessible—ramps, 
elevators, 
wheelchair options, the new lift here 
on the Senate floor. 
Dave has tackled everything from big 
infrastructure questions to the small-
est details. Before any big event like a 
joint address or inauguration or just on 
a normal workday, you could run into 
Dave walking rounds across the entire 
campus searching for obstacles that 
less keen eyes might have missed. 
But physical accessibility is just one 
part of what Dave and his team do. The 
OCAS also provides crucial services to 
supply American Sign Language inter-
preters for our meetings. They trans-
late letters into Braille. They will con-
sult with offices to ensure an intern or 
staffer has the tools they need. 
It is a vital team. And for decades, 
their quarterback has been famous for 
his cheerfulness and humor, his dedica-
tion, and the thousand ways he has 
gone above and beyond the call of duty. 
Dave has spent decades in the business 
of unlocking opportunities—the oppor-
tunity to visit here, to meet with your 
Senator or your Congressman, take a 
job here. His excellence and dedication 
have unlocked door after door after 
door. 
Dave, the Senate congratulates you 
on your well-earned retirement. Thank 
you for your devoted work to keep our 
government by the people and for the 
people.

ior Senator from Ohio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2176 
April 27, 2022 
Two months ago, I sent a letter to 
the Attorney General demanding an-
swers why the Department of Justice 
was hanging out to dry four deputy 
U.S. marshals who had bravely de-
fended the Portland courthouse against 
leftwing street militias in the summer 
of 2020. Those marshals are now facing 
civil litigation, but the Department is 
refusing to defend them in court, put-
ting them at risk of bankruptcy, and 
perhaps most alarming of all, it won’t 
even tell them why. 
Now, the Department still hasn’t pro-
vided definitive answers; and after I 
raised this alarm, they took another 
step and put the marshals on limited 
duty, telling them that after 20 months 
of active unrestricted duty they are 
now under investigation for the events 
in Portland. That is despite the fact 
that they received an award for their 
actions in Portland, received out-
standing and excellent performance 
evaluations for 2020, and were, again, 
deployed to some of the most dan-
gerous and high-risk missions that our 
law enforcement officers can under-
take. 
Call me crazy, but I have to say this 
seems like a case of potential retalia-
tion. But it does, in a way, give the 
marshals the information we were 
seeking to help them understand their 
status. I also understand that at least 
one marshal has filed a complaint for 
retaliation against Vanita Gupta, the 
Assistant Attorney General. 
The facts will come out one way or 
another. My message to the Depart-
ment of Justice today is this: You will 
be held accountable for your actions 
against these law enforcement officers 
if they are inappropriate or even un-
lawful. If not this year, it will happen 
next year because I also want to add 
that yesterday, I and several of my col-
leagues, including the Judiciary Com-
mittee’s 
ranking 
member 
Senator 
GRASSLEY
and the former Judiciary 
Committee chairman, Senator GRA-
HAM, sent a letter to the Department 
about this investigation. We intend to 
get to the bottom of it, and we are 
committed to an oversight investiga-
tion in the 118th Congress if one 
doesn’t occur in this Congress. 
I have also spoken to our Republican 
colleagues on the House Judiciary 
Committee who have today issued a re-
quest to the Department of Justice to 
preserve documents in this matter. 
Now that I am confident the Depart-
ment will receive the oversight that it 
deserves in this matter, I will no longer 
object to these nominees. Therefore, 
given these developments in this mat-
ter, I will withdraw my objection to 
the confirmation of today’s nominees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the following nomi-
nations en bloc: Ryan K. Buchanan, of 
Georgia, to be United States Attorney 
for the Northern District of Georgia for 
the term of four years; Jason M. 
Frierson, of Nevada, to be United 
States Attorney for the District of Ne-
vada for the term of four years; Mark 
A. Totten, of Michigan, to be United 
States Attorney for the Western Dis-
trict of Michigan for the term of four 
years; Marisa T. Darden, of Ohio, to be 
United States Attorney for the North-
ern District of Ohio for the term of 
four years; Delia L. Smith, of the Vir-
gin Islands, to be United States Attor-
ney for the District of the Virgin Is-
lands for the term of four years; Eddie 
M. Frizell, of Minnesota, to be United 
States Marshal for the District of Min-
nesota for the term of four years; 
LaDon A. Reynolds, of Illinois, to be 
United States Marshal for the North-
ern District of Illinois for the term of 
four years; Trina A. Higgins, of Utah, 
to be United States Attorney for the 
District of Utah for the term of four 
years; Jane E. Young, of New Hamp-
shire, to be United States Attorney for 
the District of New Hampshire for the 
term of four years; and Vanessa Rob-
erts Avery, of Connecticut, to be 
United States Attorney for the District 
of Connecticut for the term of four 
years? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF MARISA T. DARDEN 
Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator COTTON 
for working together on this. These 
nominations are very important to our 
States. I heard Senator MCCONNELL 
earlier talking about crime on the 
streets, and getting these people in 
place is really important. It has been 
473 days since the 6 million people in 
the Northern District of Ohio last had 
a permanent U.S. attorney. 
The pandemic is causing an alarming 
rise in violent crime, especially gun 
crimes. The Northern District is no ex-
ception. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has 
experienced its highest caseload in 30 
years by filing a record 846 indictments 
in 2021. Even before the pandemic, the 
district had a staggering caseload. Last 
year, there were 170 homicides in the 
city I live in, the city of Cleveland—an-
other 30-year record—not to mention 
the surge in carjackings. Filling this 
important law enforcement position to 
keep our community safe is essential. 
I hear from police officers in des-
perate need of help. They need more re-
sources, whether it is bulletproof vests 
to support local law enforcement, oper-
ations training to engage with those 
they serve, or getting U.S. marshals 
and U.S. attorneys on the job. Today, 
with Senator COTTON, we are able to do 
that. 
We 
have 
an 
extremely 
qualified 
nominee ready and eager to serve. 
Marisa Darden is a seasoned prosecutor 
with extensive experience as the lead 
attorney in both criminal and civil 
cases. No one has any objections to 
her. Nobody has any doubt about her 
accomplishments and capacity to excel 
in this job. She was assistant U.S. at-
torney in the Northern District and 
was recognized for her work on several 
complex legal cases. She received the 
National High Intensity Drug Traf-
ficking Area Award for Outstanding 
Opioid Investigative Effort. She re-
ceived the Award for Outstanding In-
vestigative Effort—a different one—in 
2019. She has significant management 
experience and a record of strong lead-
ership. 
Federal Judge Benita Pearson said: 
You can be assured Ms. Darden will fierce-
ly enforce the law while treating all—attor-
neys, staff, the accused, and the commu-
nity—with respect and appropriate sensi-
tivity. 
Former Acting U.S. Attorney Justin 
Herdman, a Republican—the last con-
firmed U.S. attorney in the Northern 
District—described her as an attorney 
‘‘of outstanding ability and unques-
tioned integrity.’’ 
First Assistant Federal Public De-
fender Jacqueline Johnson wrote her 
first recommendation for a U.S. attor-
ney in 38 years of practice—imagine 
that. She said that she ‘‘possesses the 
intellect, vision, temperament, and 
judgment needed to lead [this] office.’’ 
DEA Special Agent in Charge Keith 
Martin echoed those comments, saying 
that ‘‘she is one of the best he has en-
countered.’’ 
It is because of these qualifications 
that Senator PORTMAN has joined me in 
supporting Ms. Darden’s nomination. 
Her confirmation would be historic, 
making her the first African-American 
woman to serve as U.S. attorney for 
the Northern District of Ohio. 
Today, we come together to get 
qualified and talented law enforcement 
professionals on the job. I thank Sen-
ator COTTON
for his cooperation on 
this, and I thank the Presiding Officer, 
Senator BALDWIN, for her work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous con-
sent that I be permitted to complete 
my remarks before the scheduled vote 
at 3:30. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ULYSSES S. GRANT 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, 200 
years ago today, one of our Nation’s 
greatest heroes was born. Ulysses S. 
Grant rose from humble beginnings to 
stand next to Lincoln and Washington 
as one of America’s indispensable men. 
This great defender of America won our 
bloodiest war, crushed the darkest 
forces of disunion, bandaged our deep-
est national wounds, and bridged the 
greatest political divides. He was an 
unshakable pillar of strength upon 
which this Nation’s future rested time 
and again. 
Virtually no one foresaw Grant’s rise 
to greatness before the Civil War. Al-
though he had graduated from West 
Point and distinguished himself as a 
soldier in the Mexican-American War, 
he had later stumbled from one failure 
to another in business. 
In 1861, Grant was a man bent by hu-
miliation and ridicule but unbroken.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2177 
April 27, 2022 
After the Confederates attacked Fort 
Sumter, Grant rose from his knees as 
destiny called, he redonned his uni-
form, and he marched into the history 
books. 
For the first 3 years of the Civil War, 
Grant fought on the western front, win-
ning several of the Union’s early vic-
tories while commanders in the East 
dithered. After Grant’s first great vic-
tory, his Confederate counterpart sued 
for peace and asked what terms he 
would give them. Grant firmly re-
sponded that he would accept ‘‘no 
terms except an unconditional and im-
mediate surrender.’’ This earned him 
the 
nickname 
‘‘Unconditional 
Sur-
render’’ Grant and resulted in the larg-
est capture of enemy troops in the his-
tory of the Western Hemisphere up to 
that time. 
Grant waged a relentless form of war-
fare. He knew that, in his words, ‘‘the 
art of war is simple enough. Find out 
where your enemy is. Get at him as 
soon as you can. Strike him as hard as 
you can and as often as you can, and 
keep moving on.’’ 
Grant’s 
warrior 
spirit 
famously 
moved President Lincoln to declare ‘‘I 
can’t spare this man—he fights.’’ When 
Grant’s enemies spread the rumor that 
he was an alcoholic and should be dis-
missed, Lincoln wryly responded that 
if he could find out what brand of whis-
key Grant drank, he would send a bar-
rel of it to all the other commanders. 
Grant’s famous determination and 
grit were on full display during the 
brutal Battle of Shiloh, one of the 
bloodiest episodes of the Civil War. In 
the first day of fighting, Grant’s army 
was mauled by Confederate forces 
under the command of Albert Sidney 
Johnston, the Confederacy’s most com-
petent general at the time. 
William 
Tecumseh 
Sherman 
ap-
proached Grant that rainy night be-
neath a great oak tree and he said, 
‘‘Well, Grant, we have had the devil’s 
own day, haven’t we?’’ 
Grant replied, between puffs of his 
ubiquitous cigar, ‘‘Yes. Lick em tomor-
row though.’’ He made good on this 
promise, threw back the Confederate 
forces, and won the carnage-filled bat-
tle. 
Sidney Johnston was killed in the 
fighting, and Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis later wrote that ‘‘it 
was the turning point of our fate.’’ 
This story remains so legendary in 
the Army today that it was common-
place for young officers in the Iraq war 
to conclude a hard day by borrowing 
from Grant: ‘‘Lick em tomorrow.’’ 
Grant continued his brilliant streak 
of victories, and on July 4, 1863—the 
87th anniversary of the signing of the 
Declaration of Independence—he seized 
the fortress city of Vicksburg on the 
Mississippi, splitting the Confederacy 
in two and securing the Union’s control 
of that mighty river. This was perhaps 
the greatest strategic victory of the 
war, and combined with the victory at 
Gettysburg the previous day, Grant’s 
seizure of Vicksburg put the Union on 
the path to victory. 
Soon after Grant’s decisive victory in 
the 
Battle 
of 
Chattanooga 
a 
few 
months later and capture of the sup-
posedly impregnable heights of Mis-
sionary Ridge, Lincoln promoted him 
to the rank of lieutenant general—a 
position that no one had held since 
George Washington. A few days later, 
Lincoln also named him commander of 
Union forces. 
In his new command, Grant quickly 
turned eastward and confronted Robert 
E. Lee, a skilled tactician who had run 
circles around the Army of the Poto-
mac for 2 years. Lee had spooked Union 
commanders for so long with his auda-
cious battle plans but not Grant. He 
said: 
I am heartily tired of hearing about what 
Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem 
to think he is suddenly going to turn a dou-
ble somersault and land in our rear and on 
both our flanks at the same time. Go back to 
your command, and try to think what we are 
going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is 
going to do. 
What Grant did was pursue Lee’s 
army ruthlessly. As he marched into 
the Confederacy, he told a reporter: 
If you see the President, tell him from me 
that whatever happens, there will be no 
turning back.’’ 
In the weeks and months that fol-
lowed, Grant attacked Lee’s army 
again and again. Whether he won or 
not, Grant continued to advance deeper 
into the Confederacy. Grant’s army 
fought in the burning forests of the 
wilderness and in the muddy trenches 
of Petersburg, experiencing extraor-
dinary hardship but never allowing Lee 
to regroup or reinvigorate his shrink-
ing army. Less than a year after Grant 
began 
his 
overland 
campaign, 
the 
Union forces finally took the rebel cap-
ital of Richmond and broke the back of 
Confederate resistance. 
But U.S. Grant wasn’t a great leader 
simply because he won the war; he was 
also great because he never lost sight 
of the first goal of the war: to reunite 
our shattered Republic and restore 
what Lincoln had called the ‘‘bonds of 
affection’’ and the ‘‘mystic chords of 
memory’’ between Americans, North 
and South. 
Instead of humiliating Lee at Appo-
mattox Court House, Grant offered him 
generous and honorable terms. Uncom-
promising in war, Grant was magnani-
mous in peace. He allowed Confederate 
officers to keep their sidearms and 
horses, did not demand Lee’s sword, 
and promised not to prosecute rebels 
who laid down their arms. As Lee de-
parted the courthouse, Grant and his 
staff took off their hats in respect—a 
small act for the victors but an ex-
traordinary gesture to the defeated 
Confederates. 
Grant remained in the Army after 
Appomattox and continued to be a 
force for reconciliation and union as we 
stitched the stars back on Old Glory. 
He didn’t allow vengeance or anger to 
overcome prudence and wisdom. He 
even defended his former antagonist 
Robert E. Lee when President Andrew 
Johnson tried to renege on the terms of 
Grant’s surrender agreement. When 
Johnson asked Grant ‘‘When can these 
men be tried?’’ Grant replied ‘‘Never, 
not unless they break their parole.’’ He 
went so far as to tell his staff that ‘‘I 
will not stay in the Army if they break 
the pledges that I made.’’ To Grant, his 
word was more important than any of-
fice. Thanks to his principled stand, 
Johnson backed down, and our Nation 
avoided cycles of fruitless recrimina-
tion. At the same time, Grant also op-
posed Johnson’s attempts to weaken 
Reconstruction and leave newly freed 
slaves exposed to inhumane treatment 
by vengeful former masters. Grant 
wanted neither excessive punishment 
nor excessive lenience; he wanted jus-
tice. 
Never a politician, Grant neverthe-
less acquiesced to popular demand and 
Republican entreaties to run for Presi-
dent in 1868 on the simple platform 
‘‘Let us have peace.’’ Although his ad-
ministration was imperfect, he fought 
to make good on his promise. He con-
tinued his work to bring the South 
back into the Union, restoring the 
rights of citizenship to over 150,000 
former rebels and bringing Robert E. 
Lee to the White House as a symbol of 
reconciliation. 
Grant was also one of the greatest 
civil rights Presidents in our Nation’s 
history, protecting freed slaves with 
laws and, when necessary, with force. 
When the first Ku Klux Klan terrorized 
the South, Grant ordered and empow-
ered the Department of Justice and the 
Army to destroy it, and it was de-
stroyed. 
Grant also healed the wounds that 
the Civil War had inflicted on our rela-
tionship with other nations. He settled 
a spiraling diplomatic crisis with Great 
Britain, provoked by Britain’s decision 
to allow Confederate warships to be 
built in its ports, which went on to 
sink over 150 Union ships. After years 
of negotiation, the United States and 
Great Britain signed the Treaty of 
Washington, in which Great Britain 
formally apologized for its support of 
the Confederacy. The treaty further es-
tablished an independent commission 
to assess damages inflicted on Amer-
ican commerce, which in turn ordered 
the British to pay our country over $15 
million in damages. Grant also worked 
to settle other outstanding concerns in 
the treaty, paving the path to strong 
relations with Great Britain in the fu-
ture. 
After his Presidency, Grant sadly 
was conned in business ventures and 
fell deeply into debt. But even as he lay 
dying of cancer, he resolved to provide 
for his family. A week before his death, 
he completed his memoirs, a monu-
mental literary achievement that con-
tinues to rank among the greatest ever 
written by any statesman. He also 
saved his family from debt, dem-
onstrating one last time his indomi-
table will. 
Grant’s funeral procession was the 
largest public demonstration in Amer-
ican history up to that point, with an

estimated 11⁄2 million Americans in at-
tendance. 
Frederick Douglass described Grant 
as ‘‘a man too broad for prejudice, too 
humane to despise the humblest, too 
great to be small at any point.’’ Doug-
lass saw in Grant ‘‘a protector’’ to 
freed Blacks, ‘‘a friend’’ to Indians, ‘‘a 
brother’’ to vanquished foes, and ‘‘a 
savior’’ for our imperiled Nation. 
Yet progressive historians, a partisan 
press, and political enemies tarnished 
his record from the beginning. They 
have maligned him as a drunk and a 
butcher and a bumbling western rube 
who was ill-suited to politics and prob-
ably corrupt at that. This is an 
ahistorical slander against a great 
American. 
As a deeply honest man and a Wash-
ington outsider, Grant perhaps wasn’t 
always astute in spotting the unscru-
pulous swindlers and grifters attracted 
to our capital then as now. As Presi-
dent, he trusted some who didn’t de-
serve that trust. His critics have exag-
gerated this guilelessness as a mortal 
sin, using dishonesty of others to be-
smirch the record of a good and great 
man. But Douglas was right; Grant was 
‘‘a savior’’ of this Republic, and his few 
failings pale in comparison to his ex-
traordinary achievements. And Grant’s 
countrymen agreed, electing him twice 
by historic landslides. 
I have four photos hanging on the 
wall of my Senate office, photos of 
great statesmen who saved the West in 
our hour of crisis: Abraham Lincoln, 
Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, and 
U.S. Grant. Throughout his life, U.S. 
Grant embodied a profound patriotism 
and selflessness that our Nation should 
remember with awe and reverence. On 
this bicentenary of his birth, we should 
restore him to the pantheon of Amer-
ican heroes, first among Americans. 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT KRISTEN TRINDLE 
Madam President, America’s retreat 
from Afghanistan was a dark chapter 
for our country. We all remember the 
terrible scenes of desperate people 
clinging to the undersides of planes, of 
Taliban thugs beating innocent people, 
and most tragically of all, the 13 flag- 
draped remains of brave American 
service men and women killed by an 
ISIS suicide bomb. We will never forget 
those tragic events. They are grim re-
minders about the wages of weakness 
in Washington. 
But for every act of cowardice in 
Washington, for every act of evil by 
our enemies, there was an act of even 
greater bravery by our troops. As they 
always do, America’s heroes redeem 
even the most forlorn missions through 
extraordinary action. I would like to 
recognize one of our Nation’s heroes 
today. 
Navy LT Kristen Trindle is a member 
of my team in the Senate, where she 
does excellent work as my deputy na-
tional security adviser, after starting 6 
years ago as my intern. 
I 
know 
that 
Lieutenant 
Trindle 
would be too humble to sit beside me 
today if she had any idea about what I 
am going to say. But last year she took 
a leave of absence from her Senate du-
ties to deploy with the Navy Reserves. 
That deployment took her to Kabul, 
the eye of the storm. 
Lieutenant Trindle served as aide-de- 
camp to the general in charge of evacu-
ation. Their mission: to save as many 
Americans and Afghan allies as pos-
sible from the advancing Taliban. Lieu-
tenant Trindle immediately proved her 
worth. For weeks, she was everywhere 
at once, creating on-the-fly methods to 
screen evacuees, coordinating evacu-
ation efforts with counterparts from 
four countries—even helping orphans 
in the chaos of the Kabul airport. 
Those actions alone would have been 
worthy of commendation, but Lieuten-
ant Trindle went above and beyond the 
call of duty. She volunteered to leave 
the relative safety of headquarters to 
lead a clandestine extraction team 
charged with finding and recovering 
Americans and Afghan allies. These 
dangerous rescue missions often re-
quired Lieutenant Trindle to go out-
side the wire to rescue highly vulner-
able evacuees. She executed these mis-
sions in the dead of night, despite con-
firmed threats, within sight of the 
enemy. 
Armed Taliban fighters were regu-
larly within 100 yards of her position, 
beating and whipping civilians and 
menacing 
Americans. 
Lieutenant 
Trindle was unfazed by this danger. 
She carried on with her mission. 
Lieutenant Trindle and her team res-
cued an astounding 961 Americans and 
Afghan allies. That group included 
young kids, pregnant women, injured 
civilians, as well as high-ranking gen-
erals, helicopter pilots, translators— 
even an Afghan Supreme Court justice. 
Suffice it to say, many of these evac-
uees would be in jail, or worse, if Lieu-
tenant Trindle and her team hadn’t 
been there. 
At this time, my staff in Washington 
and Arkansas were working around the 
clock to evacuate American citizens. 
Two of those Americans, a married 
couple, had visited Afghanistan for a 
wedding right before being trapped be-
hind 
enemy 
lines. 
They 
made 
a 
harrowing journey through Taliban 
checkpoints to reach Kabul, where 
they got stuck for days, unable to get 
to the airport. 
They called my office’s evacuation 
hotline for help, and we guided them as 
far as we could—to the chaos of the air-
port gate—while we updated the co-
ordination cell just beyond the barri-
cade. Suddenly, Lieutenant Trindle ap-
peared. You can find the cell phone vid-
eos of that nighttime rescue online. 
The Americans were screaming for 
help. The Taliban fighters were sav-
agely attacking civilians nearby. Then, 
over the roar and din of the crowd 
came the calm, resolute voice of Lieu-
tenant Trindle, saying, ‘‘She’s with 
me.’’ That couple is now home in 
America, in safety. Lieutenant Trindle 
was with them. 
The Nation has awarded Lieutenant 
Trindle the Bronze Star for her actions 
during the evacuation. I had the great 
honor of presenting that medal to her 
earlier today. 
As the official account of Lieutenant 
Trindle’s actions note, she ‘‘achieved 
100% mission success in the face of un-
paralleled chaos.’’ I would add that 
Lieutenant Trindle met ‘‘unparalleled 
chaos’’ with unparalleled courage. She 
deserves every bit this high honor, and 
she deserves her country’s sincere grat-
itude. 
Thank you very much, Kristen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
thank both her and Senator COTTON for 
their service to our country. 
ULYSSES S. GRANT 
Madam President, I know the vote is 
imminent, but I wanted to also echo 
his words on Ulysses S. Grant. 
History was not always kind to 
Grant, as a general and as a President. 
With the publication of Ron Chernow’s 
book on Grant, many of us and many 
historians and many citizens changed 
their views on Grant as a very impor-
tant general and a very important 
President, who did mostly the right 
things on race after the Civil War. And 
if he could have served another term or 
two, our country would look very dif-
ferent, in terms of race and in terms of 
the structure, in terms of the Black 
codes and Jim Crow and structural rac-
ism that we have seen in this country. 
I just wanted to call to the Senate’s 
attention, Senator BLUNT and I have a 
resolution—it may be hotlined later 
today, I believe—in commendation, 
thanking President Grant, honoring 
the life and legacy of U.S. Grant and 
the commemoration of his 200th birth-
day. So I also wanted to add those com-
ments. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant executive clerk 
(Alaina Skalski) proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CONFIRMATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we 
have just gotten some very good news, 
and that is that the Senate has con-
firmed the U.S. attorneys and U.S. 
marshals who had been blocked for 
quite a long time. It is a good thing 
that our Republican colleagues finally 
stopped their indefensible obstruction 
of qualified U.S. attorneys and mar-
shals. These nominees are vital to 
keeping our communities safe and se-
cure, and they should never have been 
held up for leverage in partisan games. 
The nominees are vital to keeping 
our communities safe and secure. After 
months of waiting, communities in 
Georgia and Ohio and Nevada and Min-
nesota and New Hampshire and other 
States are finally getting the security

The Senator from Wyoming. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the need for more American energy. 
Since his first day in office, Joe 
Biden has been on a war—an all-out 
war—against American energy. 
In his very first week in office, he 
stopped all new leases of oil and gas on 
public lands. That was completely ille-
gal for the President to do that. A few 
months later, a Federal court told the 
President that what he had done was 
illegal. 
The law states that the American 
people may explore for energy on Fed-
eral lands, and the law calls for ways 
that it can be done. So here we are 
now, 15 months into the Biden adminis-
tration, and, finally, Joe Biden has 
grudgingly agreed to follow the law. He 
is going to sell a bare minimum of 
leases to obey the court order. 
So how much is a bare minimum? 
Well, for the entire State of Utah—my 
neighboring State—they are only offer-
ing one single parcel to the entire 
State. And at the same time, Joe Biden 
is raising the cost of American energy 
production to the point that he is rais-
ing Federal royalty rates on the energy 
produced on that Federal land by 50 
percent. 
When we produce less American en-
ergy, the American people end up pay-
ing more for the energy they use. This 
is Joe Biden’s economy in a nutshell, 
the economy that has given us the 
highest cost inflation in 40 years. 
In the last hundred years, no Presi-
dent has ever raised these royalty fees 
for producing American energy until 
Joe Biden. It just shows that when it 
comes to energy, Joe Biden is further 
to the left of any previous American 
President. 
So who is going to pay for these high-
er fees on Joe Biden’s attack on Amer-
ican energy? People understand it. 
They know that they are going to be 
the ones who are going to have to pay 
for it, and often it is the people who 
can least afford it in our home States 
and across the country. 
These higher costs for American en-
ergy—thanks to Joe Biden—are going 
to be paid for by working families, peo-
ple who are already struggling to keep 
up and falling further behind in Joe 
Biden’s economy. Producing less, rais-
ing costs—it is the perfect recipe for 
more inflation. 
As I was coming down to the floor, I 
walked by a TV screen. The bottom 
screen shot said: ‘‘Joe Biden’s approval 
rating hits an alltime low.’’ It seems to 
be happening all the time, week after 
week, month after month, continuing 
to fall in the polls because the Amer-
ican people are distressed and in pain 
over what this President and what the 
Democrats in the House and the Senate 
are doing to the people of this great 
country. Doing the bare minimum, this 
President may satisfy the courts, but 
it is not enough to satisfy or save 
struggling families. 
To stop this inflation nightmare, we 
need a long-term commitment to pro-
ducing more American energy. Energy 
companies aren’t going to invest if 
they think—and Joe Biden tells them 
and threatens them—that he wants to 
shut them down tomorrow. That is ex-
actly, though, what he continues to 
talk about doing. 
So just last week, after the President 
gave a speech and said: Well, we need 
to at least do these leases, his climate 
czar, Gina McCarthy—I guess she must 
really be the one who is running the 
show down there in the White House. 
This is after the President of the 
United States made a speech about 
what he says we are going to do, you 
know. ‘‘Pay no attention,’’ she says, 
‘‘to the President.’’ She said he is ‘‘ab-
solutely committed to not moving for-
ward with additional drilling on public 
lands.’’ Who is calling the shots? She 
said: ‘‘We had no choice but to follow 
the court ruling.’’ 
Then they asked the Press Secretary. 
She said last week: ‘‘We are going to 
continue to fight this court [ruling]’’— 
continue to fight—‘‘that is forcing our 
hand.’’ 
They are going to continue to fight 
the American people all the way to the 
ballot box in November, where the 
American people say, we have had 
enough of this stuff. 
Then there is Joe Biden’s climate 
czar, John Kerry, former Member of 
this body, former Secretary of State. 
Here is just a couple of things that he 
has had to say recently. He said, ‘‘We 
have to put the [natural gas] industry 
on notice.’’ He said, ‘‘You’ve got [no 
more than] six years, eight years, no 
more than 10 years,’’ he said. He said, 
‘‘by 2030 in the United States, we will 
not have coal plants.’’ He says, ‘‘We 
will have to be phasing out coal plants 
five times faster’’ than we are doing 
now. 
These are people who are not com-
mitted to affordable energy. These are 
people who are not committed to the 
fight against inflation. These are peo-
ple who are not committed to the 
American people and the American 
families who go to work every day, try 
to put food on the table, try to get 
their kids to school. Oh, no. 
And what does John Kerry, then— 
who does he have to praise? Well, he 
praised the energy policy of the State 
of California. Which State has the 
highest energy cost in America? Cali-
fornia. That is the Biden administra-
tion telling the American people, we 
want you to be like California. We 
want you to pay even more than you 
are paying now. 
Joe Biden and the environmental ex-
tremist who the President obeys are

doing everything they can to under-
mine investment in American energy. 
It is time for this White House to stop 
this war on American energy. 
The White House cannot get by—this 
country cannot get by when the White 
House does the bare minimum. This 
White House should be doing every-
thing that we can to produce more 
American energy, bring down the costs 
for American families. 
Joe Biden needs to open up public 
lands for energy production. The Fed-
eral lands are the property of the 
American people. We have the re-
sources. We have it in our country. We 
have it in the ground right now. This is 
a solution to the inflation crisis that is 
hitting families all across the country. 
There is no excuse for this adminis-
tration to continue to block the Amer-
ican people from developing the re-
sources that we have in order to bring 
down the costs, improve their lives. 
Joe Biden needs to approve the 4,600 
drilling permit applications he cur-
rently has sitting on his desk. He needs 
to speed up the process for pipeline per-
mits, not crush them. And he needs to 
stop attacking American energy work-
ers. These workers, these are the peo-
ple who keep the lights on in this coun-
try. These people are those who keep 
the 
economy 
running. 
These 
hard 
workers deserve our support. They de-
serve our gratitude. They don’t deserve 
the way they are being treated by this 
administration 
and 
this 
President. 
These are the people who can help us 
get out of this crisis that Joe Biden has 
created. 
The American people are fed up with 
Joe Biden making excuses and drag-
ging his feet. It is what I saw while 
walking here to the Senate floor on the 
television screen today: ‘‘Joe Biden’s 
approval rating hits an alltime low.’’ 
The American people want and de-
mand real solutions. What they deserve 
is more American energy. And unless 
this administration wakes up and de-
livers that, those alltime low approval 
ratings of this President are going to 
get even worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
FEDERAL RESERVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the Senate is considering several of 
President Biden’s picks to sit on the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve. I have already voted against two 
of these nominees. I believe they all 
should be voted down by the Senate. 
Under its current leadership, the Fed 
has lost the trust of the American peo-
ple and failed to uphold its role as an 
independent body. 
I have been clear about my dis-
approval of the Fed’s policies, espe-
cially its massive and its still-growing 
balance sheet. Both now and through-
out recent history, the Federal Reserve 
has been behind the curve and far too 
late in taking action to keep America’s 
economy stable. 
Its policies to sustain and grow such 
a massive disproportionate growing 
balance sheet are a perfect example of 
its failure to properly manage the eco-
nomic needs of our Nation. 
For years, I have asked—I have 
urged—Chair Powell and members of 
the Federal Open Market Committee to 
reduce the Fed’s unprecedented bal-
ance 
sheet. 
Nothing 
has 
changed. 
Month after month, we have watched 
the Fed continue to purchase billions 
in treasuries and mortgage-backed se-
curities. There is still no plan to wind 
down and right size the Fed’s balance 
sheet, which today, sits at nearly 40 
percent of GDP. 
Before the pandemic in 2019, the 
Fed’s balance sheet assets totaled just 
under $4 trillion. Today, it is more 
than double to nearly $9 trillion dol-
lars. That is more than 10 times the as-
sets the Fed held in 2007, when the bal-
ance sheet was under $1 trillion. 
The Federal Reserve’s massive bal-
ance sheet is becoming a massive prob-
lem. When the Fed buys up treasuries 
and mortgage-backed securities and 
holds them like this, it is distorting 
the credit markets and allocation of 
capital, ultimately hurting our poorest 
families and Americans on fixed in-
comes. 
And look at how the Fed’s policies 
have made homeownership unattain-
able for young people. These policies 
have helped drive up home prices, put-
ting the purchase of a home further out 
of reach for young families across our 
Nation. 
Now, I will admit that the COVID–19 
pandemic presented our Nation with 
historic challenges, but the Federal Re-
serve’s overreaction and then refusal to 
react 
to 
changing 
economic 
cir-
cumstances over the last year is unac-
ceptable. The Fed’s mismanagement 
and their management failures have 
been especially disastrous during the 
Biden administration. Instead of fight-
ing for the interests of American fami-
lies, he has chosen to appease the ad-
ministration hellbent on reckless, in-
flation-fueling spending. 
It is clear to me that the raging in-
flation crisis we are seeing across 
America is the fault of Joe Biden and 
Joe Biden alone. But the Fed’s weak 
appeasement has helped grease the 
wheels in advancing Biden’s reckless 
spending agenda. 
This isn’t just my opinion. The Fed 
knows this is true. Just weeks ago, the 
San Francisco Fed wrote that the 
spending packages Biden pushed to al-
legedly counteract the effects of the 
pandemic actually fueled inflation. 
I have written letters, held meetings, 
and had phone calls with Chair Powell 
and members of the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee to express my concerns 
and demand action to shrink the bal-
ance sheet. Again, Chair Powell and 
the Federal Reserve have chosen to do 
nothing. 
Not one member of the Board of Gov-
ernors has been able to explain to me 
why the balance sheet is so big and 
what size it should be. At every turn, 
when the Fed could have been fighting 
for American families by mitigating 
the long-term risks of its massive bal-
ance sheet and telling the truth about 
the terrible consequences of reckless 
government spending, it, instead, chose 
to appease Joe Biden, Wall Street, and 
the Democrats running Washington, all 
at the expense of American families. 
How does Biden reward the Fed for 
playing nice with him? By turning 
Chair Powell into his inflation scape-
goat. 
Earlier today, in the Senate Com-
merce Committee, after I asked the ad-
ministration 
when 
inflation 
would 
come back down, Secretary Raimondo 
deflected and blamed Chair Powell and 
the Fed. 
But here is my question: If the Biden 
administration really believes the Fed 
bears responsibility for inflation, why 
are they renominating these officials? 
Why aren’t they putting people in who 
actually can solve the problem? It 
makes no sense, but that is the endless 
blame game the Biden administration 
likes to play. 
Americans are sick of weak policy in 
Washington. It is time for the Federal 
Reserve to start fighting for real Amer-
icans, not Washington politicians. It is 
clear that the Fed needs new inde-
pendent and courageous leadership to 
truly address our Nation’s economic 
problems. Weakness in Fed leadership 
has produced unsustainable monetary 
policy that threatens the long-term 
economic health of our country. It is 
the very thing I have been warning 
about for months. 
It is clear that the current leadership 
of the Fed just doesn’t care. They don’t 
deserve to hold these seats. They have 
lost the trust of the American people, 
and they should be replaced with indi-
viduals who will actually stand up for 
American families and protect the 
American economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
TITLE X 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, for 
more than 50 years, the Title X Family 
Planning Program has provided birth 
control, cancer screenings, HIV tests, 
and other essential healthcare services 
to millions of Americans. 
Now, this program primarily serves 
patients who already face many bar-
riers to accessing healthcare. Six in 
ten women who rely on the program for 
contraception say that a title X pro-
vider is the only healthcare provider 
they see all year. Yet Republican poli-
ticians, like Senator RUBIO, are now 
using this crucial program, which has 
historically enjoyed bipartisan sup-
port, for political theater. 
This vote is only one part of a broad 
and sustained assault by Republican 
politicians on Americans’ healthcare, 
including patients’ rights to make de-
cisions 
about 
their 
own 
bodies. 
Through repeated efforts to limit birth

April 27, 2022 
control access, to defund Planned Par-
enthood, and to restrict abortions, Re-
publicans are chipping away at Ameri-
cans’ health, at Americans’ safety, and 
at Americans’ economic independence. 
In 2018, the Title X Program served 
nearly 4 million people annually, but in 
2019, the Trump administration issued 
a radical gag rule that decimated the 
title X provider network, causing more 
than 1,000 healthcare centers to leave 
the program and severely restricting 
access to basic primary and preventive 
healthcare services. The COVID–19 pan-
demic only made access to these serv-
ices even more difficult, disproportion-
ately 
harming 
low-income 
commu-
nities and people of color. 
By 2020, with the combined effects of 
the Trump administration’s awful pol-
icy and the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
program was only able to serve 1.5 mil-
lion people—less than half the number 
of people it had served in 2018. In Mas-
sachusetts, by January 2021, only one 
title X grantee remained, and six 
States had no title X providers at all 
even though the need had grown. 
Now, fortunately, last October, the 
Biden-Harris administration reversed 
Trump’s radical assault on the Title X 
Program. That was an important vic-
tory which prioritized patients’ needs, 
patients’ health equity, and access to a 
broad range of services provided by 
title X providers. 
Now, however, Senator RUBIO is once 
again trying to turn back the clock on 
healthcare and reproductive rights in 
what is just the latest attempt to deny 
people access to critical healthcare. If 
enacted, Senator RUBIO’s resolution 
would harm millions of Americans, 
people who rely on title X providers 
like Planned Parenthood, local health 
departments, and community health 
centers for family planning and sexual 
health services. 
Healthcare is a basic human right. 
Everyone deserves access to affordable 
family planning and sexual health serv-
ices, from birth control to STI treat-
ments, to pregnancy tests, no matter 
their ZIP Code, no matter their in-
come. People of color, people living in 
rural areas, people living in medically 
underserved areas, and people with low 
incomes already face immense dispari-
ties in healthcare access and in health 
outcomes. If we return to this radical 
Trump-era policy and cut back on basic 
healthcare services, the effects will dis-
proportionately harm communities of 
color, uninsured people, and low-in-
come 
people, 
exacerbating 
existing 
health disparities. 
This vote couldn’t come at a worse 
time. The United States is facing surg-
ing rates of sexually transmitted infec-
tions. On top of that, Americans are 
facing rampant attacks on abortion 
and reproductive rights all across this 
country. Abortion has been virtually 
inaccessible to millions of Texans for 
several months now. 
Even though the majority of Ameri-
cans—the 
majority 
of 
Americans— 
agree that Roe v. Wade should remain 
the law of the land, the Supreme Court 
is poised to overturn the decision in 
just 2 months. Meanwhile, Republican- 
controlled 
State 
legislatures, 
emboldened by our extremist Supreme 
Court, have passed over 500 anti-abor-
tion bills this year alone. Just this 
month, three more States enacted 
clearly unconstitutional attacks on 
abortion, counting on an extremist Su-
preme Court to back them up later on. 
That is why now is the time to 
strengthen and expand access to crit-
ical birth control and other essential 
healthcare services that the Title X 
Program provides. That means not just 
defending title X but increasing fund-
ing for the program so that HHS can 
rebuild the title X provider network 
and adequately fund the providers, 
many of whom have already been ap-
proved for grants but who haven’t re-
ceived a single dollar because there 
simply isn’t enough funding to meet 
the need. 
Let’s be clear. This is not just about 
healthcare; it is yet another rightwing 
attempt 
to 
deny 
people—especially 
people of color, especially LGBTQ+ 
people, especially low-income people— 
the right to control their own futures. 
This is about economic justice. People 
who can’t access basic reproductive 
and healthcare services cannot fully 
participate in our economy, and they 
have 
fewer 
economic 
opportunities 
going forward. An unplanned preg-
nancy can derail an education or the 
early steps of a career. 
So, today, I am fighting to defend 
title X—a program founded in 1970 with 
bipartisan support. I am fighting to de-
fend it from radical, rightwing attacks. 
Republican politicians may think that 
they will win by dividing Americans, 
but when it comes to the fight for re-
productive rights, we will fight to en-
sure that every person gets the care 
they need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the life 
and legacy of an extraordinary man, a 
giant among Senators, and a dear 
friend: Senator Orrin Hatch. He was a 
man of vision and unparalleled legisla-
tive accomplishment. 
As the longest serving Senator in 
Utah’s history, his unwavering dedica-
tion to our State and country during 
four decades of public service will be 
remembered for generations to come. 
Few individuals have left such an in-
delible mark on the U.S. Senate. He did 
this through his legislation. He did it 
through the relationships he had with 
other Senators. He did it through bi-
partisanship. He did it through his re-
lationship with Presidents of both par-
ties. 
Like his good friend Ted Kennedy, he 
was the lion of the Senate. Now, I 
know that there have been a number of 
Senators who take responsibility for 
accomplishing many things, but I don’t 
think there has ever been a legislator 
who has gotten more done legislatively 
than Orrin Hatch. Our judiciary, the 
fundamentals of our economy, even our 
national character are more elevated 
and more secure thanks to his leader-
ship, thanks to his undaunted capacity 
to plow ahead. Sponsoring and cospon-
soring more legislation than any other 
Member at the time of his retirement, 
he used his time in this Chamber to 
work tirelessly to help people who 
sometimes 
were 
overlooked. 
He 
reached across the aisle to forge strong 
bipartisan relationships that allowed 
him to pass landmark legislation. 
Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy were 
once signing a bill together, cele-
brating the same bill, and President 
Reagan turned to Orrin Hatch and said, 
‘‘How is it that you and Ted Kennedy 
are celebrating the same piece of legis-
lation?’’ Orrin turned back and looked 
at him and said, ‘‘Well, it’s very sim-
ple, Mr. President. It’s very clear that 
one thing is obvious: One of us didn’t 
read it.’’ 
His sense of humor was well known 
in this Chamber and throughout our 
State. His friends often remarked that 
Orrin could have been a standup comic 
if he wanted to, but he had too many 
important things to do to take that job 
seriously. 
He put friendship above politics. He 
called me in 1994. I was then running 
for a Senate seat against Ted Kennedy. 
It was kind of a tall task for a guy 
from Massachusetts to go up against 
Ted Kennedy, but I figured someone 
needed to do it and wanted to see if I 
couldn’t get Ted Kennedy on the right 
track. But, at that time, Orrin Hatch 
and I hardly knew each other. We were 
just distant acquaintances. But he was 
a close friend of Ted Kennedy’s, and he 
called me and said, ‘‘Mitt, you know I 
am a Republican too. I am responsible 
for helping get a lot of Republicans 
elected, but I am not going to come 
campaign for you,’’ and he said, ‘‘be-
cause Ted Kennedy is just that good of 
a friend.’’ Orrin put friendship above 
politics. 
Now, in addition to his legislative ac-
complishments, Orrin Hatch played a 
pivotal role in several landmark con-
firmations while serving as one of the 
longest chairs of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. His positive impact on the 
State of Utah and the Nation’s Federal 
judiciary cannot be overstated. 
When I was asked to run the 2002 
Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake 
City, I met with Orrin Hatch and said, 
‘‘I am going to need your help.’’ He 
made it very clear that the success of 
the Olympics, coming, as they were 
going to do, to our State, would be a 
high priority for him and that he would 
do whatever was necessary to support 
our effort. 
Then came the crisis of 9/11 in 2001. I 
knew that I couldn’t invite the people 
of the world to come to Salt Lake City 
unless I was 100 percent confident that 
everything that could be done would be 
done to keep them safe. Without the

help of the Federal Government, there 
could be no secure provision for the 
Games and no certainty that we could 
be protected. 
The morning after the attacks of 9/11, 
I happened to be in Washington, and I 
called Senator Hatch on the phone. He 
at the time was in his Senate office. I 
asked if we could get together at some 
point to talk about how we could move 
forward and provide the security fund-
ing that might be necessary to protect 
our Games. Without hesitation, he 
said, ‘‘Come over to the office right 
now.’’ 
I did so. When we got there, we sat 
down, and he said, ‘‘What do you think 
you need?’’ And I described the need for 
fencing and personnel to evaluate the 
security threats that might exist, a 
military air capacity to secure the 
skies over Salt Lake City during the 
Games. 
He said: Well, what is the biggest 
challenge you will face? 
I said: Well, Senator John McCain of 
Arizona has not been a fan of providing 
support for Olympic Games. He thinks 
that money has been misused in the 
past. 
He said: Well, it wouldn’t be misused 
now, given what has happened with 
9/11. Let’s go see John McCain right 
now. 
He picked up the phone and called 
Senator McCain. Senator McCain said 
he would be happy to see me and his 
friend Orrin Hatch. We went over to 
Senator McCain’s office and sat down. 
Orrin Hatch proceeded to describe how 
important it was that we host the 
games and that Senator Hatch get the 
support that he needed. And, in fact, 
Senator McCain made it very clear he 
would not stand in the way of doing 
anything we needed to secure the 
games in Salt Lake City. 
I owe Orrin Hatch a great deal of 
credit for helping us to be able to host 
games in Salt Lake City successfully 
and to do so without security incident. 
I think everyone knows that Orrin 
Hatch was a man of tremendous faith. 
He was an advocate to protect religious 
freedom, and legislation that he au-
thored in this regard still stands in 
protecting the rights of people of faith 
in our country today. He dedicated his 
life to a commitment to Jesus Christ 
and to the principles of Christianity. 
He did so in my own faith by accepting 
callings in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, serving as both a 
missionary as a young man and later 
as a bishop of a congregation. 
Orrin Hatch enjoyed life and appre-
ciated all that it had to offer. You may 
know that he was a composer and has 
a number of songs and musical per-
formances to his credit. He wrote po-
etry. He wrote jokes. When I was run-
ning for President, he sent me a whole 
page of jokes he wanted me to use. I 
must admit, I looked at them one by 
one. I didn’t think they were that 
funny, but I read them to the people on 
the bus and they listened to them one 
by one and the more they listened, the 
funnier they got. By the time I was fin-
ished with the page, they were howling 
with laughter. 
The man had an extraordinary capac-
ity with music, with humor, with legis-
lation, with friendships—really one of a 
kind. 
He also was pretty good at self-depre-
cating jokes. He told me to lighten up 
a little bit and be a little more free 
with my language, so I decided to let 
‘‘heck’’ and ‘‘dang’’ drop into my words 
from time to time. 
His affinity for buffets and bacon 
were not to be forgotten as well. In his 
words, we should choose ‘‘to live every 
day like [it was] Bacon Lovers Day.’’ 
And I hope we will savor life as he did. 
Orrin Hatch believed that the people 
you love and the friends you have are 
the real currency in life. I believe that 
deeply. He had a lot of friends, not just 
in this room but friends throughout 
these buildings, friends throughout our 
State. 
I remember walking through the Cap-
itol with Orrin Hatch and from time to 
time someone would come up to him 
and want to ask him a question or ask 
for help on some issue of theirs. And 
instead of doing what most of us do— 
which is putting our head down and 
rushing on and pointing out that we 
have important things to get to—he 
would stop and bend his very tall phy-
sique down to listen to what the person 
had to say and listen attentively and 
say he would do what he could to help. 
I have seen that time and time again 
with Orrin Hatch. 
He always had time for the people he 
served, and he believed he served all 
the people of the United States of 
America. Not surprisingly, he had and 
still has a lot of friends. 
Of course, when you think of people 
he loves, first on that list would be his 
wife Elaine and their family. They to-
gether raised 6 children and 23 grand-
children, 26 great-grandchildren. He 
and Elaine were married for more than 
six decades. She has been by him every 
step of his career and his political in-
volvement in our country. 
Ann and I send our deepest condo-
lences to Elaine and the entire Hatch 
family. God be with you until we meet 
again, Orrin. I hope you feel I haven’t 
let you down taking your place in this 
great Chamber.

SAN). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
about 6 years ago, I came to this floor 
and presented an idea: How do we get 
on top of our debt and deficit? Are we 
going to get on top of our debt and def-
icit? 
Interestingly enough, for each of us 
and our own families, we can all tell a 
story about a season in our life that we 
really hit hard times. I have had sev-
eral where the money was really tight 
and our family was very attentive to 
what we were spending—very—those 
moments when we would literally 
make sure that every time we went to 
the grocery store, we only spent this 
much because we knew we had an elec-
tric bill coming in; we knew we had our 
rent coming due. 
My family has most definitely been 
there. My wife and I, when we were 
first married, we had a rule that we 
couldn’t ever spend more than $25 with-
out the other person knowing it be-
cause our fear was when we were first 
married that one of us would spend $30 
and the other would spend $35 that day 
and we would blow up our bank ac-
count because we were living that close 
to the edge and just getting by while I 
was at school and we were just getting 
started. A lot of families have been 
that way. 
You can tell how serious a family is 
about dealing with their debt by how 
seriously they take their expenses. 
There are some individuals that have 
massive debt that still keep running up 
their credit card. They keep buying 
more and more product. They still use 
their credit card and go get additional 
electronics and get extra stuff on it 
and max out this card and then I will 
max out another one, not with essen-
tials, just with fun—not paying atten-
tion to the fact that someday that 
comes due. 
When I started presenting the idea of 
the ‘‘Federal Fumbles,’’ my whole con-
cept was simple: Where is it the Fed-
eral Government is dropping the ball; 
that we are not paying attention to the 
areas we need to be able to pay atten-
tion to in our spending? It is a well- 
known fact that we have trillions in 
debt. In fact, as a nation, we have now 
crossed $30 trillion in total debt—$30 
trillion. It is interesting that the con-
versation doesn’t seem to be serious. 
We don’t seem to be in a dialogue 
about how we are going to actually 
bring our debt down. We are still 
spending on other things and still say-
ing, not we are limited in what we can 
do; we seem to be adding more to the 
mix. It is not necessarily on essential 
things; it just seems to be on things. 
The ‘‘Federal Fumbles’’ book that I 
released this week, put on our website, 
just details several different items. One 
is, where are we in our debt and how 
did we get here? But I also try to walk 
through some of our trust funds on this 
because I think it is important. 
Where are we on Medicare trust 
funds? By the way, we are 4 years away 
from insolvency on Medicare—4 years. 
Where are we on Social Security? We 
are 12 years away from insolvency in 
Social Security—12. Where are we on 
the highway trust fund? We are well 
past insolvency on the highway trust 
fund, and we have been accelerating 
our borrowing to try to cover more and 
more. In fact, that was done even re-
cently. 
I laid out a set of ideas of how do you 
actually solve some of these things and 
how are we going to address it. But I 
also laid out some of my frustrations 
that said, at some point, this body is 
going to be serious about dealing with 
debt and deficit, but apparently we are 
not yet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2183 
April 27, 2022 
So I laid out some areas and just got 
a chance to be to be able to talk 
through some of those in the book. And 
I encourage folks to be able to look at 
it and, quite frankly, everyone is wel-
come to disagree with me on it. 
For instance, we spent $2 billion—bil-
lion with a ‘‘b.’’ We spent $2 billion this 
last year not building the border wall. 
The contracts had already been let out. 
The steel was already purchased. The 
steel, in fact, is lying on the ground in 
the desert still today. Everyone was al-
ready hired, and there were literally 
individuals on the ground ready to do 
installation because the contract was 
there because career professionals at 
the Department of Homeland Security 
had made recommendations on certain 
areas of our southern border that des-
perately needed fencing. Those career 
professionals had worked with private 
contractors and had put a contract in 
place to be able to put fencing in those 
areas. And they were underway until 
the Biden administration stepped in on 
day 1 and stopped it all, though the 
contracts had already been let out. We 
spent $2 billion not building border 
fencing—$2 billion. 
Now, I ask the simple question: What 
would it hurt to go ahead and finish 
those contracts out that career profes-
sionals had signed off on and that ca-
reer security individuals from the De-
partment of Homeland Security had 
said was desperately needed in those 
areas? What would it have hurt to fin-
ish those contracts out? Instead, we 
sent messaging that we are not going 
to build a fence and spend $2 billion not 
doing that. 
What did we do instead? Well, we 
started doing robot dogs along the bor-
der instead. I wish I was kidding. These 
robot dogs would instead be hired to be 
able to help our border folks and Bor-
der Patrol and CBP to be able to help 
identify and carry things. So instead of 
border fencing, it is robot dogs that are 
now being contracted to be able to put 
in there. 
What else did we actually deal with? 
Well, of the trillions of dollars of debt 
that we have, recently, we put $2.6 mil-
lion into China to help pay for some of 
their health programs. Now, follow the 
irony of this. We actually borrow a 
trillion dollars from China to pay our 
bills. So we borrowed money from 
China to be able to then send money to 
China to help pay their medical ex-
penses. 
Does anyone else think this is a bad 
idea; that if we were serious about 
dealing with debt and deficit, we would 
start going line by line through all of 
this and to be able to identify that 
maybe this is not a good idea; that if 
we have $30 trillion in debt, maybe we 
need to find some areas to cut back on. 
We could cut back on that or maybe we 
could cut back on the grant that was 
given out to write about Russian 
screenwriters. We actually paid some-
one to do research on Russian screen-
writers to be able to release this 
project out so people could study Rus-
sian directors and screenwriters. 
Again, I am fine if anybody wants to 
be able to do that, but my concern is if 
we are going to do this, this should 
probably be a private project that we 
release out, not have a Federal Govern-
ment project when we are dealing with 
$30 trillion in debt. 
But what else did we do with our ad-
ditional money while we have extra 
spending and time on this? How about 
lobster pot removal? We spent half a 
million dollars in a special earmark to 
do lobster pot removal. 
Now, initially, this is actually listed 
in the bill as derelict lobster pots. Der-
elict lobster pots. That sounds really 
ominous, doesn’t it? But my under-
standing is it is lobster traps that are 
just out there that someone abandoned 
at some point. 
I would tell you, for those of us in 
Oklahoma, if you told me there is a 
lobster trap and there may be a lobster 
in it and you could keep the trap and 
the lobster if you wanted to go get it, 
we would go get it. But, instead, we are 
paying half a million dollars in Federal 
dollars to go pick up derelict lobster 
pots. 
Now, again, I would say to you, in 
Oklahoma, when we have a derelict 
well in Oklahoma, an oil and gas well, 
our oil and gas companies all pool 
money together and put a little bit in 
to be able to go clean that site up. And, 
year by year, we are cleaning up aban-
doned well sites, because our compa-
nies actually kicked the money in to 
go clean up their own messes that are 
out there. 
I don’t understand how the State 
didn’t do this or a city didn’t do this or 
the industry didn’t take it on. Now, I 
do have some frustration because there 
was some money set aside for parks as 
well. I am a big fan of parks. My kids 
go to the park. We are glad to be able 
to go to the park. I went to the park a 
lot. But there was a project for 2.3 mil-
lion in Federal money to be able to 
renovate a pool, a swimming pool, in 
Rhode Island. 
Now, I am not opposed to swimming 
pools, and I am not opposed to Rhode 
Island having swimming pools; I am 
just trying to figure out with Federal 
dollars, why the Federal government is 
paying to fix a swimming pool in 
Rhode Island. Shouldn’t this be the 
State of Rhode Island—if it is a State 
park, shouldn’t it be the State or the 
community or the city to be able to 
take this on? Cities in my State, if 
they have problems with their pool, the 
city pays to be able to fix the pool or 
the community pays to be able to do 
that, rather than the Federal tax-
payers pay to do that. We have the 
same issue, actually, with a ski jump, 
that there was a State park, that it 
needed a renovation for a ski jump, and 
so instead of the State actually paying 
for their State park, people in my 
State are paying for our State park, 
and we are paying to fix the ski jump 
in this State park as well. 
Why are we paying for both? Why 
don’t the people of Oklahoma pay for 
our State parks and the people in other 
States pay for their State parks? 
Again, I have nothing in opposition to 
ski jumping, other than it seems like a 
particularly terrible thing for me to 
do, but if somebody wants to be able to 
do it and they want to pay for that, 
that is fine. Just, why should Okla-
homa taxpayers do that? 
As we were digging through the dif-
ferent pieces that were actually done, I 
would tell you it was painful the mo-
ment when we ran across the monkey 
opera. We spent Federal tax dollars on 
something called a ‘‘monkey opera.’’ 
Now, I am not sure why we spent 
Federal tax dollars on a monkey opera. 
I am not sure what a monkey opera 
sounds like. But I would tell you, I 
think I have listened to a monkey 
opera on people’s at-hold music before 
when I have called certain companies, 
that I think the hold music they have 
was actually monkey opera. But I have 
to ask the hard question: Is this na-
tional defense? Is this educating our 
children? Is this healthcare? 
With $30 trillion in debt, at some 
point, we as a Nation have to stop and 
say, ‘‘OK, let’s do what is essential and 
not what’s not.’’ 
Two weeks ago, a staff member called 
me and said she was in line at the gro-
cery store, and the woman in front of 
her with her kids pulled out all the 
stuff in her basket and put it on the 
scanner area and said to the lady that 
was going to be the cashier, ‘‘Hey, tell 
me when it gets to $150 because I can’t 
spend anymore. That is all I have.’’ 
And so the cashier kept ringing 
things up. She held things back that 
she thought were the nonessentials at 
the end because she knew, this is all I 
have, and though I would like to get 
more, I can’t. It sent me two messages. 
One is, every family knows how to do 
this. Why we can’t as a Federal govern-
ment look at it and say, with $30 tril-
lion, maybe the monkey opera is not 
one of our essentials, I don’t know. 
But the second thing it reminded me 
of is, every family is dealing with the 
real effects of inflation right now. It is 
very real for them. They are saying to 
the cashier at the grocery store, ‘‘Tell 
me when it gets to this dollar amount, 
because that is all I have.’’ 
When we continue to spend more and 
more and more as a Federal govern-
ment, it drives inflation higher and 
higher. I am very aware there are a lot 
of folks in this room who are just try-
ing to help. But we are causing real 
problems with inflation, with over-
spending as a nation. That has got to 
pull back, and we have got to get seri-
ous about what we are spending on, be-
cause this kind of stuff drives the 
American people crazy, when they are 
saying to the cashier, ‘‘I could only do 
$150. Please tell me when it gets there, 
because everything else I can’t do 
today.’’ And we borrowed more money 
from China so we could do this. 
We put out the Federal fumble book 
every year for one reason: I want to re-
mind everybody in this body that debt

is still a problem. This is still an issue, 
wasteful spending, whether it is in the 
billions or whether it is in the thou-
sands, is wasteful spending. And at the 
end of the day, we need to understand, 
the American people are counting on 
us to make hard decisions, and there 
are lots and lots of hard decisions. But 
currently as a body, we are not even 
discussing $30 trillion in debt. So I 
bring it to us again: We have $30 tril-
lion in debt. Let’s start working on 
this.

NOMINATION OF SHERILYN PEACE GARNETT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today the Senate will vote on the nom-
ination of Judge Sherilyn Peace Gar-
nett to serve as a U.S. district court 
judge for the Central District of Cali-
fornia. 
Judge Garnett is an experienced ju-
rist and a long-time public servant who 
will make an outstanding addition to 
the bench. During her 13 years as an as-
sistant U.S. Attorney, she prosecuted 
hundreds of matters, including crimi-
nal street gang offenses, child exploi-
tation, and threats made against gov-
ernment officials. In recognition of her 
accomplishments 
as 
a 
prosecutor, 
Judge Garnett received a number of 
awards from the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for the Central District of California, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement, and the U.S. Postal Service. 
Since 2014, Judge Garnett has served 
as a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, 
presiding over misdemeanor and felony 
proceedings. In 2016, she also served as 
an appellate State court judge, pre-
siding over criminal, civil, and family 
law cases. 
The American Bar Association has 
unanimously rated Judge Garnett as 
‘‘well qualified’’ to be a district court 
judge. She also has the strong support 
of her home State Senators, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN and Mr. PADILLA. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Judge Garnett’s nomina-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader.

objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
yield back all time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back.

The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Garnett nomi-
nation? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 
8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES 
CODE, OF THE RULE SUBMITTED 
BY 
THE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
RELATING 
TO 
‘‘ENSURING 
AC-
CESS TO EQUITABLE, AFFORD-
ABLE, CLIENT-CENTERED, QUAL-
ITY 
FAMILY 
PLANNING 
SERV-
ICES’’—MOTION TO PROCEED 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, for too 
long, Americans’ taxpayer dollars have 
been used as a backdoor way to help 
promote abortion as a family planning 
service. President Trump put a stop to 
this. Back in 2019, he barred the Fed-
eral Government from providing these 
funds, the funds through the title X 
Family Planning Program, from going 
to entities that refer or provide abor-
tions, organizations such as the big 
business that is known as Planned Par-
enthood. 
Now, understand, it didn’t reduce 
title X funding. It didn’t cut one penny 
of it. Instead, it directed it to organiza-
tions that do not perform and do not 
promote the taking of innocent life. 
Last year, unfortunately, the Biden 
administration, as was to be expected, 
pulled the plug on this vital protection, 
and now we see taxpayer money flow-
ing once again to these abortion pro-
viders and to their referrers. This has 
to stop, and that is why I have worked 
with Representative TONY GONZALES in 
the House to introduce the Congres-
sional Review Act of title X to ensure 
that not one more taxpayer dollar is 
used to fund the abortion industry. 
By reversing this administration’s 
ruling, abortion clinics will once again 
be excluded from receiving this tax-
payer money, and it would put more 
money toward improving and saving 
lives instead of ending them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 
to be really clear about what this vote 
is actually about. This vote is about 
birth control. This is about lifesaving 
pelvic and breast exams to detect can-
cer early, and it is about STI testing 
and treatments. That is the basic re-
productive healthcare that title X pro-
viders deliver to communities—espe-
cially to women with the tightest 
budgets. 
Republicans are here tonight fighting 
to undermine healthcare. It is really 
that simple. And we are here fighting 
to protect it. 
I fought long and hard against Presi-
dent Trump’s disastrous gag rule. It 
was a rule that cut title X provider 
networks in half. It forced entire 
States, including my home State of 
Washington, out of the Title X Pro-
gram. It forced doctors and nurses to 
withhold information from their pa-
tients on all the options they have, in-
cluding abortion, and ultimately re-
sulted in patients traveling farther, 
paying more, or going without care. In 
short, it made it harder for women to

get birth control and other critical re-
productive healthcare, and that, to me, 
is unacceptable. 
That is why I was really relieved 
when, after years of fighting back 
against Republicans’ extreme agenda, 
President Biden acted quickly to re-
verse that dangerous gag rule, and we 
could finally start rebuilding the title 
X network and providing patients with 
critical reproductive healthcare. 
And I know that patients and pro-
viders in my State were relieved too. I 
heard from them firsthand earlier this 
month about what this means for our 
communities. It means that patients in 
Washington State and across the coun-
try can get the birth control they need 
to plan a family on their own terms, 
breast and pelvic exams to detect can-
cer early, STI testing and treatment, 
and more. 
But as has been so often the case, 
most Republicans were not listening 
because, tonight, they are leading a 
resolution to bring back the gag rule 
and deny women across the country ac-
cess to services made possible by title 
X. We are talking about basic life-
saving 
healthcare 
like 
cancer 
screenings. We are talking about STI 
screenings, which, by the way, are es-
pecially important as cases, which are 
already underreported due to decreased 
screenings, have been spiking now. 
We are talking about birth control 
that so many patients depend on to 
stay healthy, to treat health condi-
tions, to plan their families, and con-
trol their own reproductive health. 
Talking about these issues, it is just 
unthinkable to me that anyone would 
not support this program. What are Re-
publicans here talking about? They are 
talking about once again taking this 
healthcare away from millions of pa-
tients, and tonight they are forcing a 
vote on it. And some extreme Repub-
licans, by the way, are even talking 
about how they think Griswold v. Con-
necticut—that is the U.S. Supreme 
Court case that first struck down a ban 
on birth control—might have been 
wrongly decided. This is chilling. 
The message Republicans are sending 
tonight 
with 
this 
vote—loud 
and 
clear—is that they won’t just stop at 
banning abortion with cruel laws like 
the ones we have seen in Texas and 
Oklahoma and across the border from 
Washington State in Idaho; they are 
determined to restrict access to all 
kinds of reproductive healthcare, from 
abortion to birth control, to STI test-
ing and treatment. 
Well, we should not stand for this. 
We can’t just let Republicans rip away 
healthcare again from women and fam-
ilies. Patients, providers, and families 
across my State and across the country 
have spoken out loud and clear on this, 
and I am going to make sure that they 
are heard here in Washington, DC. 
I will work hard to make sure we pro-
tect title X from these attacks, and I 
am going to make sure everyone who 
supports this resolution owns what this 
vote means and whom they are voting 
against: women who want birth con-
trol—and that is, by the way, two- 
thirds of women in this country; pa-
tients who are seeking STI screenings; 
patients who need a cancer screening; 
people who are just looking for afford-
able healthcare and information from 
providers that they trust because—you 
know what—women are not going to 
forget this, which party is fighting to 
protect birth control and which party 
is doing everything they can to rip 
your birth control away. 
I urge every single one of my col-
leagues to join with me in voting 
against this resolution. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I move to

TRIBUTE TO BRENDAN CANAVAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Louisville, KY, makes its mark on 
American life as the host of the Ken-
tucky Derby, the producer of the iconic 
Louisville Slugger baseball bat, and a 
place to sample America’s signature 
spirit, bourbon. Many Americans may 
not know that my hometown leaves its 
fingerprints on their lives in another 
way: as the home of the world’s largest 
automated package handling facility, 
the UPS Worldport. 
This massive warehouse—at 5.2 mil-
lion square feet, it is larger than the 
Mall of America—sorts millions of 
packages every day, speedily shipping 
them to consumers across the globe. It 
serves as the keystone of the vast UPS 
supply chain, linking consumers to 
businesses all over the country. Today, 
I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring the retirement of one of the key 
figures in the Worldport’s development, 
UPS 
Airlines 
president 
Brendan 
Canavan. 
To many, the UPS Worldport might 
seem like something out of a science 
fiction movie. Standing in the facility, 
you would be struck by the sheer scale 
of thousands of packages whirring 
about on a complicated system of con-
veyor belts, scanners, and lifts. This 
enormous warehouse sorts the average 
package in just 13 minutes. Human 
hands only touch packages twice. It is 
an amazing feat of modern technology 
and supply chain efficiency. 
It would take an extraordinarily vi-
sionary business leader to have planned 
and executed such a facility. Its scale 
and complexity are almost too vast to 
fathom. But Brendan Canavan moved 
to Louisville in 2004 and did just that. 
In only a few years, he helped turn 
Louisville into a global supply chain 
hub and brought new levels of speed to 
the process. 
Brendan knows so much about UPS’s 
operations because he has performed 
many of them himself. While in college 
in his hometown of Philadelphia, he 
worked as a UPS loader and driver. He 
later stepped into management roles 
around the country, coming into lead-
ership positions just as computer tech-
nology began to take a greater role in 
the supply chain logistics industry.

S2186 
April 27, 2022 
As a rising star in the company, 
Brendan was tasked with the develop-
ment of Louisville’s Worldport facility 
in 2004. He came to our city and quick-
ly got to work developing the ware-
house, which now processes roughly 300 
flights of UPS shipments every single 
day. For his outstanding work devel-
oping the Worldport, he was rewarded 
with greater and greater roles in UPS’s 
leadership structure. 
By 2014, Brendan had ascended to the 
presidency of UPS Airlines. In that 
role, he oversaw nearly 300 individual 
airplanes and thousands of pilots, oper-
ating all over the world at all hours of 
the day. As the coordinator of such a 
vast organization, he ensured his com-
pany 
maintained 
its 
technological 
prowess, allowing UPS to keep up with 
the ever-changing demands of its glob-
al consumers. 
Two years ago, Brendan faced a chal-
lenge unlike any UPS had ever seen: 
the coronavirus pandemic. Across the 
world, airports shut down and supply 
chains 
became 
hopelessly 
gnarled. 
Still, Brendan wielded his decades of 
on-the-ground experience to hold UPS’s 
systems together, continuing to per-
form vital services even in the face of 
seemingly insurmountable challenges. 
Now, after what must have been 
some of the most difficult years of his 
career, Brendan is taking a step back 
to spend more time with his family and 
devote extra energy to volunteering. 
His desire to aid others has not dimin-
ished one bit, and he continues to 
make a mark on Louisville. 
I want to thank Brendan for his dec-
ades of service to our country, his out-
standing leadership at UPS, and his 
hard work to make Louisville a capital 
of global supply chain logistics. On be-
half of the Senate, I share my con-
gratulations with Brendan on his ex-
traordinary career and wish him the 
best in his retirement.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. 
CASEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
last 
week, I travelled overseas as part of a 
congressional 
delegation 
conducting 
meetings on Russian aggression, secu-
rity, and food security, among other 
things. Our delegation was scheduled 
to return on Monday, April 25, but due 
to mechanical problems with our air-
craft, we were delayed for a day. 
As a result of that delay, I missed 
two votes. I take seriously my duties 
in service to the people of Pennsyl-
vania, including voting on policies and 
nominations. Accordingly, I wish for 
the record to show that, had I not been 
absent due to mechanical difficulties 
with the plane, I would have voted yea 
on the following votes: yea on vote No. 
135, on the motion to invoke cloture: 
Lael Brainerd to be Vice-Chairman of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System; yea on vote No. 136, 
on confirmation: Lael Brainerd, to be 
Vice-Chairman of the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System. 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID HAUCK 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate Mr. David Hauck 
on his retirement and recognize his 35 
years of dedicated service to the Con-
gress and the American people. 
A native of Minneapolis, MN, Dave 
began his Capitol Hill career while still 
a graduate student at American Uni-
versity, working part-time as an eleva-
tor operator in the Senate. After com-
pleting his degree, he spent 5 years 
working on the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee where he served as 
hearing coordinator and systems ad-
ministrator. 
Following his time on the Foreign 
Relations Committee, Dave became the 
assistant director of the Congressional 
Special Services Office. In 2008, Con-
gress established the Office of Congres-
sional Accessibility Services and made 
Dave its founding director. For over 29 
years, Dave has worked to ensure that 
individuals with disabilities, including 
Members, staff, and visitors to the Cap-
itol, have the best possible access to fa-
cilities and events throughout the Cap-
itol Complex. In addition to helping 
Congress create and staff the Office of 
Accessibility 
Services, 
Dave 
also 
worked with Congress throughout the 
construction of the U.S. Capitol Visitor 
Center—CVC—to make the CVC acces-
sible to all visitors. 
Dave and his team have handled the 
day-to-day accessibility needs of Con-
gress and played an important role in 
every major event Congress has seen 
over the last three decades. Dave has 
been a staunch advocate for the acces-
sibility community throughout count-
less joint sessions of Congress, the 
lying in state or lying in honor of 
many beloved Americans, and the inau-
gurations of seven Presidents. When I 
chaired the Joint Congressional Com-
mittee on Inaugural Ceremonies for 
both President Trump and President 
Biden’s inaugurations, my staff and I 
saw firsthand how invaluable Dave’s 
expertise on accessibility issues was to 
planning a seamless inauguration. 
Today, it is my pleasure to thank 
Dave for his many years of service and 
to congratulate him on his retirement. 
I wish him the best in his next chapter, 
as I am sure so many here do.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ORLEY WAITE 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I cele-
brate the life of a remarkable Amer-
ican, Orley Waite, who passed away in 
February, just 2 months shy of his 
100th birthday. 
I came to learn of Orley’s extraor-
dinary life and legacy from his grand-
daughter, who serves on my staff. 
Orley was part of our country’s Great-
est Generation, who helped secure 
Americans’ and our allies’ freedoms in 
World War II and then returned home 
to help build our country into the 
strongest in the world. Orley was born 
in Bunkerville, NV, but later made his 
home of 66 years in Huntington Park, 
CA. After attending Virgin Valley High 
School, where he excelled in track and 
field, football, and basketball, in 1941, 
he served a mission for the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to 
the Eastern States. He then joined the 
Army during World War II and served 
in Germany. His service included fight-
ing in the Battle of the Bulge and help-
ing 
liberate 
Dachau 
Concentration 
Camp. 
Orley returned from his World War II 
service and made a life and career in 
one of the most important ways pos-
sible: creating a family and shaping 
young minds to be ready for future suc-
cess. He attended Utah Agricultural 
College, Utah State, where he met and 
married Mary Loughney on July 15, 
1947. They moved to California, where 
Orley received his master’s degree in 
education at the University of South-
ern California. He then dedicated more 
than 30 years to working for Los Ange-
les Unified School District. Through-
out his career in education, he had 
many assignments, including math and 
science teacher, coach, and head coun-
selor at Gage Junior High, Carmelita 
Junior High, Jordan High School, Fre-
mont High School, and Fairfax High 
School. He influenced and encouraged 
many on their early educational paths 
and helped create opportunities as they 
learned and grew. 
He also contributed significantly of 
his time and talents to his community. 
As a lifelong member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
Orley held many leadership positions 
in the church, including bishopric 
counselor, bishop, stake presidency 
counselor, ward mission leader, semi-
nary teacher, and high council mem-
ber. He was also a member of the local 
Water Board for more than 50 years 
and served on the parks and recreation 
committee for the City of Huntington 
Park. 
Orley was a husband, father, teacher, 
missionary, church, and community 
leader and so much more to the many 
who knew him, loved him, and bene-
fited from his remarkable life. As I 
honor Orley Waite, I extend my deep 
condolences to his friends and family, 
including 
his 
children 
and 
their 
spouses: Orley ‘‘Bill’’ Jr. and Carol; 
Wallace and Donna; Carole; Joseph and 
Gail; Robert and Melinda; Martha and 
Curtis Hadlock; Jesse and Victoria; his 
22 grandchildren; and 37 great-grand-
children. The current turmoil and 
atrocities our world is witnessing in 
Ukraine reinforce just how precious 
freedom is and how much World War II 
Veterans 
and 
American 
servicemembers before and since have 
given to secure the foundations we hold 
dear. Orley Waite left a lasting legacy 
for all Americans with his service to 
our Nation and his decades of advanc-
ing educational opportunities for so 
many. God bless him and his lovely 
family.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRUCE REICHERT 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I congratu-
late Bruce Reichert who retired after 
being the host, one of the main writers, 
and executive producer of Idaho Public 
Television’s Outdoor Idaho for more 
than 35 years. 
Devoting 35 years to any occupation 
is certainly a remarkable commitment, 
but particularly so when your job 
takes you to Idaho’s rugged and hard- 
to-reach places. From exploring Idaho’s 
mountain ranges and headwaters to ex-
amining what it is like to live and 
work in Idaho’s ‘‘Spud Country’’ and 
seeking out some of our State’s most 
storied barns, Bruce has given Ida-
hoans a view of what lies beyond the 
roads, trails, and ridges. For example, 
he was executive producer and host of 
the award-winning ‘‘Canyonlands Call-
ing,’’ showcasing the magnificence and 
beauty of the Owyhee Canyonlands, 
where collaborative efforts to manage 
these lands were achieved with private 
and Federal agencies. As Bruce has 
said, ‘‘It’s a state you can easily get 
lost in, both literally and figuratively. 
I know I speak for all who work on 
Outdoor Idaho—it’s an honor to share 
our state with fellow Idahoans. Idaho is 
truly the keeper of special places. Esto 
Perpetua. May she live forever.’’ 
The other shows Bruce has produced 
include ‘‘Idaho Geology: A Convergence 
of Wonders,’’ ‘‘State of Change,’’ ‘‘50 
Years of Wilderness,’’ ‘‘Salmon Reck-
oning,’’ ‘‘Sawtooths on My Mind,’’ 
‘‘Pend Oreille Country,’’ ‘‘Land of the 
Lost 
River 
Range,’’ 
‘‘Idaho 
Head-
waters,’’ 
and 
‘‘Beyond 
the 
White 
Clouds.’’ He has earned a number of 
recognitions for his work. This in-
cludes multiple Emmys, Edward R. 
Murrow, and Press Club awards. 
Bruce, thank you, for your excellent 
work all these years to tell Idaho’s sto-
ries and shed light on the people, can-
yons, mountains, aquifers, prairies, 
lakes, fish, and wildlife that make 
Idaho such a magical place. You obvi-
ously realized long ago how truly spe-
cial our great State is and have de-
voted your career to enabling others to 
get a sense of this spectacular treasure. 
Congratulations on your remarkable 
career.∑

TRIBUTE TO HEIDI MATTHEWS- 
CANTIN AND JOHN CANTIN 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Heidi Matthews- 
Cantin and John Cantin of Manchester 
as April’s Granite Staters of the 
Month. 
Heidi 
and 
John 
comanage 
Missy’s Closet, a resale boutique that 
is holding its fourth annual ‘‘Say Yes 
to the Prom Dress’’ event this month. 
This initiative allows young women 
who otherwise would not be able to af-
ford a prom dress the opportunity to 
pick one out for free. 
John 
lost 
his 
daughter, 
Melissa 
‘‘Missy’’ Charbonneau, to a domestic 
violence incident in 2009, and Missy’s 
Closet was started in her memory. The 
resale boutique runs on donations and 
volunteers and aims to serve survivors 
of domestic violence and those strug-
gling with mental illness or substance 
misuse. 
The mission of ‘‘Say Yes to the Prom 
Dress’’ is to make sure that every 
young woman, no matter her economic 
circumstance, has the opportunity to 
feel special and confident in her gown 
on prom night. Missy’s Closet offers a 
wide range of colors and sizes that 
young women can choose from. This 
year, the boutique started off prom 
dress season with more than 1,000 do-
nated gowns, many of them new. 
In addition, each young woman is as-
sisted by a ‘‘fashion ambassador,’’ a 
volunteer who is trained to give clients 
words of encouragement and help them 
feel confident in their dresses. Free 
makeup and jewelry is also available to 
complete their looks. 
Heidi and John’s work with Missy’s 
Closet’s ‘‘Say Yes to the Prom Dress’’ 
campaign is not just about the dress; it 
is about providing young women a way 
to feel confident on their special night. 
Furthermore, it is not only the young 
women who walk away happy; the vol-
unteers at Missy’s Closet take im-
mense pride in their work and recog-
nize the importance of making a posi-
tive change in their community. As 
Heidi herself says, kindness has a 
trickledown effect, and all you need to 
do is help one person a day 
John and Heidi embody the New 
Hampshire spirit of generosity and 
kindness by working to ensure that ev-
eryone—regardless 
of 
financial 
cir-
cumstance—has the opportunity to 
thrive.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
SUNSHINE MINE FIRE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, 50 years 
ago, on May 2, 1972, 91 miners lost their 
lives when a fire broke out in the Sun-
shine Mine. Along with my colleague, 
Senator MIKE CRAPO, I rise today to 
honor those men and commemorate the 
worst mining disaster our State has 
ever seen. 
The Silver Valley mining heritage 
dates back to the 1860s. Whole genera-
tions of Silver Valley residents have 
worked in mines, with sons following 
their fathers and uncles into the min-
ing tradition. As its name indicates, 
this area in North Idaho’s Shoshone 
County is especially abundant in silver. 
Throughout its history, this region has 
produced over 1.2 billion ounces of sil-
ver, making it one of the richest silver- 
producing areas in the world. 
Mining has always been a dangerous 
job. While safety conditions in the 
mines have improved over the decades, 
the hazards of mining can be reduced, 
but never completely eliminated. 
Just before noon on May 2, 1972, a fire 
broke out on the air intake side of the 
Sunshine Mine as 173 miners worked 
underground. As the fire burned, the 
intake of air led carbon monoxide to 
fill the No. 10 mineshaft. Eighty men 
were safely evacuated from that shaft 
before the death of the No. 10 shaft 
hoistman. After that, only two more 
men were rescued. 
The cause of the fire is still un-
known, and in its wake, the Sunshine 
Mine shut down for 7 months before 
production resumed. It ceased oper-
ation in 2001, having produced over 360 
million ounces of silver. 
The 91 men who died during this hor-
rific incident left behind 77 widows and 
200 children, many of whom still reside 
in Kellogg and the surrounding area. 
The Sunshine Miners Memorial, which 
stands near where the mine was lo-
cated, lists the name of each of the 
men killed along with a poem by 
former Governor Phil Batt commemo-
rating the incident. Ken Lonn, a 
former Sunshine miner, sculpted the 
monument. 
The Sunshine Mine fire looms large 
in the region’s memory, and every year 
on May 2, the people of the Silver Val-
ley gather at this memorial to remem-
ber the tragedy. This year, Idaho Gov-
ernor Brad Little has declared May 2 as 
Miners Memorial Day. 
We commemorate the tragic and un-
timely loss of these 91 men and the dis-
aster’s decades-long impact on the Sil-
ver Valley community. We commend 
the memorial committee for their ef-
forts to preserve their legacy through 
maintenance of the memorial and by 
organizing the Miners Memorial Day 
ceremony. We hope all Idahoans will 
remember the events from May 2, 1972, 
and the men who went underground 
that morning but did not return.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARY CECILE 
BARRETO 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I honor 
Mary Cecile Barreto on the celebration 
of her 100th birthday. 
Mary Cecile Barreto was born in 
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada 
on April 19, 1922. Seeking new opportu-
nities, she and her parents moved to 
Miami, FL, in 1925. She attended Gesu 
Catholic School, joined several school 
clubs, was crowned Miss Gesu, and met 
Roger Barreto, her high school sweet-
heart whom she married after gradua-
tion. 
Cecile worked as a secretary at the 
Pan American Airlines Seaplane Ter-
minal in Miami before giving birth to 
seven sons and four daughters. Her 
children were raised with both her Ca-
nadian roots, as well as her husband’s 
Hispanic upbringing. French and Span-
ish were regularly spoken throughout 
their home. 
Cecile made time for each of her chil-
dren and made them feel special. She is 
a kind listener who is always there for 
them, no matter how busy their days 
are. Under her guidance, her children 
grew up to become a Miami Beach Po-
lice chief, real estate agents, Super 
Bowl host committee chairs, and a 
Miami-Dade Rescue deputy chief.

April 27, 2022 
In her free time, Cecile participates 
in the Miami Herald’s write-in com-
petitions, answering numerous topics 
and writing jingles. She has won many 
prizes for her answers to the competi-
tions and even donated a trip to Wash-
ington, DC, to her sister for her honey-
moon. 
During the holidays, it is not uncom-
mon for 40 or more people to gather in 
her home to celebrate. Cecile invited 
not only family and friends, but also 
those who may not have a place to be 
or anyone to spend time with. 
Cecile has lived a full life and has 
made countless differences for her com-
munity over the past 100 years. My 
wife Jeanette and I offer our best wish-
es to Cecile and hope the coming year 
will bring her much happiness and good 
health. May God bless her and her fam-
ily during this time of celebration.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. 
BURR, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. CASSIDY, 
and Mr. MARSHALL): 
S. 4094. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Relief Opportunities for Stu-
dents Act of 2003 to strike the Sec-
retary’s unilateral authority during a 
national emergency, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Biden 
administration can’t quite seem to de-
cide on the status of the pandemic or 
the status of the economy. 
On the one hand, we are being told 
that we no longer need pandemic-era 
border restrictions intended to help 
limit illegal immigration and prevent 
the spread of COVID. On the other 
hand, the administration is still fight-
ing to require Americans to wear 
masks on public transit and airplanes 
and is urging Congress to pass addi-
tional COVID spending to fight the 
pandemic the administration seems to 
believe is over at the border. 
It is a confusing message, to say the 
least. Americans know the pandemic 
can’t simultaneously be over for mi-
grants at the border but make it too 
dangerous for a South Dakotan to fly 
from Sioux Falls to Minneapolis with-
out a mask. 
The administration’s messaging is 
similarly muddled on the economy and 
student loans. On the one hand, the 
President is proudly touting ‘‘record’’ 
job creation and ‘‘record’’ economic 
growth even though most of what he is 
taking credit for is the natural con-
sequence of an economic recovery from 
the pandemic. On the other hand, the 
President recently announced that he 
is extending the moratorium on Fed-
eral student loan payments, interest, 
and collections for another 4 months, 
until August 31, because Americans are 
still suffering economically as a result 
of the pandemic. 
Well, which is it? Is our economy 
thriving or are Americans economi-
cally distressed? 
The student loan repayment morato-
rium and interest freeze included in the 
CARES Act at the beginning of the 
pandemic made sense. Our economy 
was starting to shut down, and Ameri-
cans’ jobs were in jeopardy, but it 
made sense as a temporary measure for 
a genuine emergency. We are no longer 
having double-digit unemployment as 
we did during some of the worst mo-
ments of the pandemic. In fact, our 
current unemployment rate is a low 3.6 
percent. For college graduates, the un-
employment rate is a staggeringly low 
2 percent. 
To paraphrase the Wall Street Jour-
nal’s editorial board on the subject, if 
student loan borrowers aren’t ready to 
return to making payments now, they 
will never be. 
Even the Washington Post editorial-
ized against the President’s latest ex-
tension, noting: 
What was a needed emergency measure at 
the start of the pandemic is no longer justi-
fied. It is hard to make an argument that 
college graduates are struggling right now. 
The unemployment rate for Americans with 
a bachelor’s degree or higher is a mere 2 per-
cent. There is a near-record number of job 
openings. 
That was from the Washington Post. 
It is true that Americans are facing 
economic challenges as a result of the 
inflation that President Biden and 
Democrats helped to create with their 
ill-considered American Rescue Plan 
Act, but, if anything, President Biden’s 
latest student loan pause could help 
prolong our inflation problems, and, 
importantly, it will have the biggest 
benefits for those who are most able to 
deal with price hikes from inflation. 
This clearly regressive policy benefits 
high-debt, high-income borrowers sig-
nificantly more than low-debt, low-in-
come borrowers. 
Again, to quote the Washington Post 
once more: 
Rising prices of gas, rent, food and cars are 
a hardship, but forgiving interest on student 
loans for four more months offers the biggest 
benefits to people who have earned degrees 
in medicine and law. These people go on to 
have lucrative careers. Meanwhile, the 64 
percent of Americans who do not have a col-
lege degree don’t benefit at all from Biden’s 
pause on loan repayments. 
That was again from the Washington 
Post. 
And subsidizing all of those doctors 
and lawyers ends up being pretty ex-
pensive. The student loan repayment 
moratorium has already cost the Fed-
eral Government more than $100 bil-
lion. By the time the President’s latest 
extension of the moratorium is up, it 
will have cost the Federal Government 
billions more. 
After a huge increase in our national 
debt, thanks to the pandemic and reck-
less Democratic spending, the govern-
ment does not need to be forgoing bil-
lions of dollars by providing student 
loan relief to Americans with some of 
the highest earning potential, which is 
why, this morning, I introduced legis-
lation—the 
Stop 
Reckless 
Student 
Loan Actions Act—to end the current 
deferment on student loan repayments 
and limit a President’s authority to 
pause student loan repayments in the 
future. 
My legislation, which I introduced 
with my colleague Senator RICHARD 
BURR
and Senators BRAUN, CASSIDY, 
and MARSHALL, would continue to 
allow a President to temporarily sus-
pend student loan payments during a 
future national emergency, but it 
would limit those suspensions to a pe-
riod of 90 days and subject them to con-
gressional disapproval. 
It would also ensure that relief is tar-
geted to those who need it most by pre-
venting Presidents from suspending

payments for higher income individ-
uals; and, importantly, it would pre-
vent a President or a Secretary of Edu-
cation from using a national emer-
gency to cancel student loan debt, 
which leads me to, perhaps, my biggest 
concern in all of this. 
Deferring student loan payments is a 
bad policy that is costing the Federal 
Government money it doesn’t have, but 
it pales in comparison to the ultimate 
goal for many Democrats—and that is 
canceling student loan debt entirely. 
Days ago, the President’s Press Sec-
retary, in referring to the payment 
deferment, said: 
Between now and August 31, it’s either 
going to be extended again or we’re going to 
make a decision . . . about canceling student 
debt. 
That was from the President’s Press 
Secretary. 
Her statement made it alarmingly 
clear that the President isn’t just tem-
porarily deferring loan payments but is 
seriously considering canceling—can-
celing—a significant portion of Federal 
student loan debt. 
She doubled down on that idea on 
Monday, noting: 
What I would tell you is that not a single 
person in this country has paid a dime on 
Federal student loans since the President 
took office. 
My gosh, canceling student loan debt 
is a bad idea for so many reasons. 
In the first place, it is money the 
Federal Government simply doesn’t 
have. Democrats often speak as if the 
Federal Government were able to draw 
from an unlimited pot of money, but, 
of course, we know that is not true. 
Government funds aren’t anywhere 
close to being unlimited, and govern-
ment coffers aren’t filled from a pot of 
gold at the end of the rainbow. They 
are filled by taxpayer dollars, and 
sooner or later, it will be taxpayers 
who foot the bill for any loan forgive-
ness program, including the many tax-
payers who opted not to attend college 
or who chose a debt-free way of doing 
so. 
I can scarcely think of anything 
more unfair than forcing Americans 
who incurred no college debt to shoul-
der the bill for those who did, espe-
cially when a substantial portion of 
that debt is incurred by those with the 
greatest earning potential. 
Canceling student debt would also be 
grossly unfair to the Americans who 
worked hard for years to pay off their 
loans. An American who has just fin-
ished paying off his or her higher edu-
cation debt would get nothing—noth-
ing—from such a cancellation while a 
recent graduate who had made just a 
month or two of payments could see 
his or her debt disappear entirely. 
And canceling student debt would do 
nothing to address the real problem, 
which is the out-of-control cost of 
higher education. In fact, it would like-
ly make that problem worse, not to 
mention the fact that student loan 
cancellation would take an already bad 
inflation situation and, almost un-
doubtedly, make it much worse. We 
think 8.5-percent inflation is bad, and 
it is, but canceling student loan debt 
this fall could take inflation to new 
and even more painful heights. 
Now, I strongly support finding ways 
to drive down the cost of higher edu-
cation and educate students about the 
dangers of excessive debt. I also sup-
port measures to help students pay off 
their student loans without putting 
taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of 
billions of dollars or more. I would note 
the measure that I got included in the 
CARES Act and extended later that 
year to allow employers to make tax- 
free payments on their employees’ stu-
dent loans; but unnecessarily deferring 
student loan payments—or worse, the 
canceling of a significant portion of 
student loan debt entirely—is a ter-
rible idea for many reasons. 
I hope that colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle will join the student 
loan bill that I introduced earlier 
today to end these endless and unnec-
essary loan deferment extensions. 
I hope at least some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues will recognize the 
unwisdom of canceling student loan 
debt, its blatant unfairness to individ-
uals who have already paid off their 
student loans or who never went to col-
lege and the negative effect it would 
have on our inflation-ridden economy. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4094 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Higher Education Relief Opportuni-

er Education Relief Opportunities for Stu-
dents Act of 2003 has been abused by the Ex-
ecutive Branch during the COVID-19 national 
emergency regarding the payment of Federal 
student loans. 
(3) The unilateral payment pause on Fed-
eral student loans has cost $100,000,000,000. 
(4) The individuals benefitting the most 
from the payment pause continued by the 
Executive Branch are doctors, who receive 11 
times the benefit of bachelor’s degree recipi-
ents and 14 times the benefit of associate’s 
degree recipients.

(f) DEFINITION OF COVERED LOAN.—In this 
subsection, the term ‘‘covered loan’’ means a 
loan made, insured, or guaranteed under part 
B, D, or E of title IV of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.; 1087a et 
seq.; 1087aa et seq.) or a loan under the 
Health Education Assistance Loan Program. 
SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This Act, and the amendments made by 
this Act, shall take effect on the date that is 
30 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
BOOKER, 
Mrs. 
MURRAY, 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ, and Mr. WARNER): 
S. 4097. A bill to improve access for 
diverse-owned 
asset 
management 
firms, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Too Narrow to Suc-
ceed Act with my colleagues Senators 
BOOKER, MURRAY, and MENENDEZ. En-
acting this bill would increase opportu-
nities for women- and minority-owned 
asset management firms to direct in-
vestments and strengthen our Nation’s 
retirement security. 
Women- and minority-owned firms 
are significantly underrepresented in 
asset management, managing just over 
1 percent of the sector’s assets under 
management. This severe underrep-
resentation also extends to employ-
ment within the industry. This is not 
due to a lack of diverse talent; women- 
and minority-owned asset management 
firms have consistently performed just 
as well as or better than other firms in 
terms of returns on investment. In 
fact, women- and minority-owned firms 
are overrepresented among top-per-
forming firms. 
Having a diverse portfolio is a key 
part of having healthy finances because 
diversifying 
investments 
mitigates 
risk and improves long-term returns. 
Far too often, however, those making 
investment decisions at our Nation’s fi-
nancial firms are not diverse. If asset 
managers have too narrow a perspec-
tive, the/place the financial success of 
their clients at risk. This common-
sense legislation supports asset man-
agers’ fiduciary responsibility to de-
liver returns to investors, and it will 
help ensure a safe financial future for 
workers and their families. 
I hope my colleagues will support 
this bill.

SENATE RESOLUTION 596—DESIG-
NATING 
APRIL 
2022 
AS 
‘‘PRE-
SERVING 
AND 
PROTECTING 
LOCAL NEWS MONTH’’ AND REC-
OGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE AND 
SIGNIFICANCE OF LOCAL NEWS 
Mr. SCHATZ (for himself, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. 
WYDEN, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. MARKEY, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Mr. BROWN, Mr. CASEY, and 
Mrs. MURRAY) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 596 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
the principle of freedom of the press en-
shrined in the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, which de-
clares that ‘‘Congress shall make no law . . . 
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the 
press . . .’’; 
Whereas an informed citizenry depends on 
accurate and unbiased news reporting to in-
form the judgment of the people; 
Whereas a robust, diverse, and sustainable 
local news presence leads to civic engage-
ment and the buttressing of democratic 
norms and practices; 
Whereas local news serves as a necessary 
resource during the COVID-19 pandemic to 
provide communities with public health in-
formation and to inform communities about 
available services and support from Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial govern-
ments; 
Whereas published guidance from the De-
partment of Homeland Security deemed 
journalists as essential critical infrastruc-
ture workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Whereas the absence of local news outlets 
and investigative reporting allows local gov-
ernment corruption and corporate malfea-
sance to go unchecked; 
Whereas local journalists help combat 
disinformation by using their community 
knowledge and connections to debunk fraud-
ulent or misleading content; 
Whereas local cable franchises routinely 
provide for public educational and govern-
ment access channels on their systems, and 
those channels— 
(1) offer vital local civic programming that 
informs communities; 
(2) provide news and information not often 
available on other local broadcast channels 
or cable; 
(3) supplement local journalism; and 
(4) at times, are the only source for local 
news; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
trust local news sources by a 2-to-1 margin; 
Whereas, according to recent research— 
(1) the United States has lost more than 
2,100 local print outlets since 2004; 
(2) more than 200 counties in the United 
States have no newspaper at all, creating a 
news shortage for the 3,200,000 residents of 
those counties; 
(3) of the remaining counties in the United 
States, more than 1⁄2, or 1,528, have only 1 
newspaper to cover populations ranging from 
under 1,000 to more than 1,000,000 residents; 
(4) more than 1⁄2 of all United States news-
papers have changed owners in the past dec-
ade, and, in 2018, only 25 companies owned 2⁄3 
of all daily newspapers; 
(5) of the surviving 6,700 newspapers in the 
United States, at least 1,000 qualify as 
‘‘ghost newspapers’’, or newspapers with re-
porting and photography staffs that are so 
significantly reduced that they can no longer 
provide much of the breaking news or public 
service journalism that once informed read-
ers about vital issues in their communities; 
and 
(6) rural counties are among the counties 
most deeply impacted by the loss of local re-
porting, as more than 500 of the 2,100 news-
papers that have closed or merged since 2004 
are in rural counties; 
Whereas, while overall employment in 
newspaper, television, radio, and digital 
newsrooms dropped by roughly 26 percent, or 
30,000 jobs, between 2008 and 2020, the plunge 
in newspaper newsrooms alone was much 
worse at 57 percent, or 40,000 jobs, in that 
same time period; 
Whereas the number of news employees in 
the radio broadcasting industry dropped by 
22 percent between 2004 and 2020; 
Whereas beat reporting, meaning the day- 
to-day coverage of a particular field that al-
lows a journalist to develop expertise and 
cultivate sources, has ceased to be a viable 
career for would-be journalists due to the 
decimation of newsroom budgets; 
Whereas requests submitted under section 
552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
referred to as ‘‘Freedom of Information Act 
requests’’), by local newspapers to local, 
State, and Federal agencies fell by nearly 50 
percent between 2005 and 2010, demonstrating 
a significant drop in the extent to which 
local reporters request government records; 
Whereas newspapers alone lost more than 
$35,000,000,000 in advertising revenue between 
2004 and 2018; 
Whereas, in the second quarter of 2020, ad-
vertising revenue fell by a median of 24 per-
cent for local television companies; 
Whereas the revenue of all-news radio sta-
tions dropped by 24 percent in 2020; 
Whereas there remains a significant gender 
disparity in newsroom employment, with 
women comprising approximately 1⁄3 of staff 
who are 30 years of age or older; 
Whereas women who are local television 
news 
anchors 
and 
reporters, 
especially 
women of color, are often subject to harass-
ment and stalking; 
Whereas, across the United States, there 
are more than 200 newspapers published by 
and for Black readers, and, in recent years, 
many of those newspapers have seen— 
(1) significant losses in advertising revenue 
as small businesses in their communities 
were forced to close; and 
(2) circulation declines due to the closures 
of businesses in their communities; 
Whereas the number of Black journalists 
working at daily newspapers dropped by 40 
percent between 1997 and 2014, more than for 
any other demographic group; 
Whereas the number of print media sources 
published by and for American Indian read-
ers has shrunk dramatically in recent years, 
from 700 media outlets in 1998 to only 200 in 
2018; 
Whereas Tribally-owned news outlets are 
often dependent on Tribal governments for 
funding, but most of those outlets lack the 
policy structure necessary to fully protect 
journalistic independence; 
Whereas a 2018 survey by the Native Amer-
ican Journalists Association found that 83 
percent of respondents believed that Native

press coverage of Tribal government affairs 
was 
sometimes, 
frequently, 
or 
always 
censored; 
Whereas there are more than 550 Latino 
news media outlets in the United States, 
which rely primarily on a declining adver-
tising revenue base; 
Whereas the lack of local news impacts 
communities that speak languages other 
than English, which are often excluded from 
national media coverage; 
Whereas more than 100 local newsrooms 
have closed during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Whereas 8 percent of surveyed local radio 
stations reported the COVID-19 pandemic 
ended their local news programs entirely; 
Whereas 30 percent of local television news 
stations reported budget cuts and staff re-
ductions because of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Whereas PEN America proposed ‘‘a major 
reimagining of the local news space’’ in its 
2019 call-to-action report, ‘‘Losing the News: 
The Decimation of Local Journalism and the 
Search for Solutions’’, and called on society 
and the Federal Government to urgently ad-
dress the alarming demise of local jour-
nalism; and 
Whereas, half a century ago, Congress per-
ceived that the commercial television indus-
try would not independently provide the edu-
cational and public interest broadcasting 
that was appropriate and necessary for the 
country, and, informed by an independent re-
port prepared by the Carnegie Commission 
on Educational Television, created the Cor-
poration for Public Broadcasting, which has 
since ensured that radio and television in-
clude public interest educational and report-
ing programs using annually appropriated 
funds: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2022 as ‘‘Preserving and 
Protecting Local News Month’’; 
(2) affirms that local news serves an essen-
tial function in the democracy of the United 
States; 
(3) recognizes local news as a public good; 
and 
(4) acknowledges the valuable contribu-
tions of local journalism towards the main-
tenance of healthy and vibrant communities.

ROSEN, Mr. BOOKER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN,

mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 597 
Whereas 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of 
the Hispanic Association of Colleges and 
Universities National Internship Program 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘HNIP’’); 
Whereas the HNIP began with 24 interns in 
the summer of 1992 and has grown to a year- 
round internship program for Hispanic and 
underrepresented students, placing over 500 
interns every year in multiple Federal agen-
cies; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Hispanic population 
accounted for 62,100,000, or 18.7 percent, of 
the total United States population; 
Whereas, according to the Annual Report 
to the President on Hispanic Employment in 
the Federal Government for Fiscal Year 2018 
by the Office of Personnel Management, only 
9.1 percent of Federal employees were His-
panic and only 3.3 percent were in Senior Ex-
ecutive Service positions; 
Whereas the HNIP has been cited in the 
Hispanic Nine Point Plan by the Office of 
Personnel Management as a resource to in-
crease the recruitment of Hispanic interns in 
the Federal Government; and 
Whereas the HNIP has produced over 14,000 
alumni who are now in the Federal Govern-
ment, State or local government, and private 
industry: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the Hispanic Association of 
Colleges and Universities National Intern-
ship Program (referred to in this resolving 
clause as ‘‘HNIP’’) for 30 years of providing 
internship opportunities to Hispanic and 
underrepresented students attending His-
panic-serving institutions and other institu-
tions of higher education; 
(2) congratulates all HNIP alumni who con-
tinue to make a difference in the commu-
nities of the United States; and

port and inspire future Hispanic and under-
represented leaders.

S. RES. 599 
Whereas almost 2,600,000 individuals dem-
onstrate courage and commitment to free-
dom by serving in the reserves or active duty 
in the Armed Forces of the United States; 
Whereas 35.9 percent of active duty mem-
bers of the Armed Forces have children; 
Whereas approximately 2,000,000 military 
children have experienced a parental deploy-
ment since September 11, 2001; 
Whereas no one feels the effect of deploy-
ments more than the children of deployed 
members of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas approximately 2,300,000 children 
under the age of 18 live with a veteran who 
is disabled; 
Whereas more than 25,000 military children 
have experienced the death of a military par-
ent since September 11, 2001; 
Whereas the daily struggles and personal 
sacrifices of children of members of the 
Armed Forces are too often unnoticed; 
Whereas countless children live with a par-
ent who is a member of the Armed Forces 
and who bears a visible or invisible wound of 
war; 
Whereas the children of members of the 
Armed Forces are a source of pride and 
honor to the people of the United States, and 
it is fitting that the United States recognize 
the contributions and celebrate the spirit of 
such children; 
Whereas the National Month of the Mili-

unconditional support of the United States 
for members of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas, in addition to programs of the

sacrifices and the challenges that these chil-
dren face; and 
Whereas a month-long salute to military

S. 
GRANT IN COMMEMORATION OF 
HIS 200TH BIRTHDAY 
Mr. BLUNT (for himself, Mr. BROWN, 
and Mr. COTTON) submitted the fol-
lowing concurrent resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. CON. RES. 36 
Whereas, on July 1, 1843, Ulysses S. Grant 
graduated from the United States Military 
Academy at West Point, and, on July 31, 
1854, Grant resigned from the Army at the 
grade of Captain; 
Whereas, following President Abraham 
Lincoln’s April 15, 1861, proclamation calling 
for 75,000 volunteers to suppress Confederate 
forces, Ulysses S. Grant rejoined the Army 
and helped recruit and train volunteer sol-
diers for the Union; 
Whereas, over the course of the American 
Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant commanded a cu-
mulative total of over 620,000 Union soldiers 
and achieved major victories, including Fort 
Henry (February 1862), Fort Donelson (Feb-
ruary 1862), Shiloh (April 1862), the Vicks-
burg Campaign (November 1862–July 1863), 
Chattanooga (November 1863), the Wilderness 
Campaign (May 1864–June 1864), the Peters-
burg Campaign (June 1864–April 1865), and 
the Appomattox Campaign (April 1865); 
Whereas, on February 29, 1864, Congress re-
established the grade of ‘‘Lieutenant-General 
of the United States Army’’ and authorized 
the President to appoint, by and with the ad-
vice and consent of the Senate, an officer 
who was ‘‘most distinguished for courage, 
skill, and ability’’ (38th Congress, Session I, 
Chap. 14, Sec. 1), and that same day, Presi-
dent Abraham Lincoln nominated Ulysses S. 
Grant to be Lieutenant-General; 
Whereas, on March 10, 1864, President 
Abraham Lincoln formally appointed Ulys-
ses S. Grant to the grade of Lieutenant-Gen-
eral of the Army, a position previously held 
by only George Washington and Winfield 
Scott, although Scott’s promotion was a bre-
vet appointment; 
Whereas, on July 25, 1866, Congress estab-
lished the grade of ‘‘General of the Army of 
the United States’’ (39th Congress, Session I, 
Chap. 232), and Ulysses S. Grant was ap-
pointed, by and with the advice and consent 
of the Senate, to General of the Army of the 
United States for his role in commanding the 
Union armies during the Civil War; 
Whereas, on March 4, 1869, Ulysses S. Grant 
was sworn in as the 18th President of the 
United States; and 
Whereas, throughout his two terms as 
President, Ulysses S. Grant secured the rati-
fication of the 15th amendment to the Con-
stitution, the creation of the Department of 
Justice, and the passage and implementation 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1875: Now, there-

(1) honors Ulysses S. Grant for his efforts 
and leadership in defending the union of the 
United States of America; 
(2) recognizes that the military victories 
achieved under the command of Ulysses S. 
Grant were integral to the preservation of 
the United States of America; and 
(3) affirms that Ulysses S. Grant is among 
the most influential military commanders in 
the history of the United States of America.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am

Ulysses Grant was an amazing human 
being. I became acquainted with him 
when I read the biography of Ulysses 
Grant written by Mr. Chernow, a 
Brooklyn resident, who was very eager 
for us to pass this. One of his crusades 
in life was to undo the smears against 
Ulysses Grant, often perpetrated by 
southern historians after we won the 
Civil War for the Union. And I com-
mend to everybody Mr. Chernow’s 
book. It is an amazing book.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I re-
turn to the floor tonight with a happy 
announcement on the jobs and com-
petition bill: We have reached an 
agreement 
with 
Republicans 
that 
clears the path to entering into a con-
ference with the House. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will hold two 
votes: one on cloture and one to ap-
prove our measure making the con-
ference committee official. 
Next Tuesday and Wednesday, we 
will then hold floor votes on 28 motions 
to instruct—8 from Democrats, 20 from 
Republicans. 
Tonight’s agreement is very good 
news for America, for good-paying jobs 
in America, for economic strength in 
America, for investments in the kinds 
of science and technology that will 
help us grow as a country and provide 
great futures for the next generation. 
This bill represents the next major 
step forward towards finally sending a 
jobs and competition bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk. Of course, I wish it would 
have happened much sooner; but, nev-
ertheless, the time has come to move 
forward on this bill. 
Let me add this: This will be the 
most votes on motions to instruct of 
any bill in decades—a sign of both the 
immense good will we have shown to 
our Republican colleagues and the fact 
that many Members on both sides of 
the aisle have a stake in seeing this 
bill finalized. 
We have a lot of work left to do, but 
this agreement is a big step forward to-
wards finally enacting the legislation 
to lower costs, bring manufacturing 
back to America, and strengthen our 
supply chains so we can keep our econ-
omy strong for decades. 
I want to thank my colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle who worked in 
good faith to reach this point. 
f

COMMISSION TO STUDY THE PO-
TENTIAL CREATION OF A NA-
TIONAL MUSEUM OF ASIAN PA-
CIFIC AMERICAN HISTORY AND 
CULTURE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 3525, the ‘‘Commission 
to Study the Potential Creation of a National 
Museum of Asian Pacific American History 
and Culture Act.’’ 
This bill seeks to create the first national 
museum dedicated to preserving the history, 
culture, and accomplishments of Asian Pacific 
Americans (APA). 
As the representative for the 18th District of 
Texas, which has a significant Asian popu-
lation, this bill is of great personal importance 
to me. 
Asian Americans are significant contributors 
of our nation’s history as champions of social 
and racial justice. Yet, Asian Americans have 
also uniquely suffered in the United States, 
and those stories should also be told. 
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the 
first and only major federal legislation to ex-
plicitly suspend immigration for a specific na-
tionality. The basic exclusion law prohibited 
Chinese laborers—defined as ‘‘both skilled 
and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed 
in mining’’—from entering the country. 
Subsequent amendments to the law pre-
vented Chinese laborers who had left the 
United States from returning. The passage of 
the act represented the outcome of years of 
racial hostility and anti-immigrant agitation by 
white Americans, set the precedent for later 
restrictions against immigration of other na-
tionalities, and started a new era in which the 
United States changed from a country that 
welcomed 
almost 
all 
immigrants 
to 
a 
gatekeeping one. 
Another glaring example of their suffering 
are the internment camps of World War II. 
Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had 
identified German, Italian, and Japanese 
aliens who were suspected of being potential 
enemy agents; and they were kept under sur-
veillance. Following the attack at Pearl Harbor, 
government suspicion arose not only around 
aliens who came from enemy nations, but 
around all persons of Japanese descent, 
whether foreign born (issei) or American citi-
zens (nisei). During congressional committee 
hearings, representatives of the Department of 
Justice raised logistical, constitutional, and 
ethical objections. Regardless, the task was 
turned over to the U.S. Army as a security 
matter. 
The entire West Coast was deemed a mili-
tary area and was divided into military zones. 
Executive Order 9066 authorized military com-
manders to exclude civilians from military 
areas. Although the language of the order did 
not specify any ethnic group, Lieutenant Gen-
eral John L. DeWitt of the Western Defense 
Command proceeded to announce curfews 
that included only Japanese Americans. Next, 
he encouraged voluntary evacuation by Japa-
nese Americans from a limited number of 
areas; about seven percent of the total Japa-
nese American population in these areas com-
plied. 
On March 29, 1942, under the authority of 
the executive order, DeWitt issued Public 
Proclamation No. 4, which began the forced 
evacuation and detention of Japanese-Amer-
ican West Coast residents on a 48-hour no-
tice. Only a few days prior to the proclamation, 
on March 21, Congress had passed Public 
Law 503, which made violation of Executive 
Order 9066 a misdemeanor punishable by up 
to one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
Because of the perception of ‘‘public dan-
ger,’’ all Japanese Americans within varied 
distances from the Pacific coast were tar-
geted. Unless they were able to dispose of or 
make arrangements for care of their property 
within a few days, their homes, farms, busi-
nesses, and most of their private belongings 
were lost forever. 
From the end of March to August, approxi-
mately 112,000 persons were sent to ‘‘assem-
bly 
centers’’—often 
racetracks 
or 
fair-
grounds—where they waited and were tagged 
to indicate the location of a long-term ‘‘reloca-
tion center’’ that would be their home for the 
rest of the war. Nearly 70,000 of the evacuees 
were American citizens. There were no 
charges of disloyalty against any of these citi-
zens, nor was there any vehicle by which they 
could appeal their loss of property and per-
sonal liberty. 
‘‘Relocation centers’’ were situated many 
miles inland, often in remote and desolate 
locales. Sites included Tule Lake, California; 
Minidoka, Idaho; Manzanar, California; Topaz, 
Utah; Jerome, Arkansas; Heart Mountain, Wy-
oming; Poston, Arizona; Granada, Colorado; 
and Rohwer, Arkansas. (Incarceration rates 
were significantly lower in the territory of Ha-
waii, where Japanese Americans made up 
over one-third of the population and their labor 
was needed to sustain the economy. How-
ever, martial law had been declared in Hawaii 
immediately following the Pearl Harbor attack, 
and the Army issued hundreds of military or-
ders, some applicable only to persons of Jap-
anese ancestry.) 
In the ‘‘relocation centers’’ (also called ‘‘in-
ternment camps’’), four or five families, with 
their sparse collections of clothing and pos-
sessions, shared tar-papered army-style bar-
racks. Most lived in these conditions for nearly 
three years or more until the end of the war. 
Gradually some insulation was added to the 
barracks and lightweight partitions were added 
to make them a little more comfortable and 
somewhat private. Life took on some familiar 
routines of socializing and school. However, 
eating in common facilities, using shared rest-
rooms, and having limited opportunities for 
work interrupted other social and cultural pat-
terns. Persons who resisted were sent to a 
special camp at Tule Lake, California, where 
dissidents were housed. 
In 1943 and 1944, the government assem-
bled a combat unit of Japanese Americans for 
the European theater. It became the 442d 
Regimental Combat Team and gained fame 
as the most highly decorated of World War II. 
Their military record bespoke their patriotism. 
As the war drew to a close, ‘‘internment 
camps’’ were slowly evacuated. While some 
persons of Japanese ancestry returned to their 
hometowns, others sought new surroundings. 
For example, the Japanese-American commu-
nity of Tacoma, Washington, had been sent to 
three different centers; only 30 percent re-
turned to Tacoma after the war. Japanese 
Americans 
from 
Fresno 
had 
gone 
to 
Manzanar; 80 percent returned to their home-
town. 
The internment of Japanese Americans dur-
ing World War II sparked constitutional and 
political debate. During this period, three Japa-
nese-American citizens challenged the con-
stitutionality of the forced relocation and cur-
few orders through legal actions: Gordon 
Hirabayashi, Fred Korematsu, and Mitsuye 
Endo. Hirabayashi and Korematsu received 
negative judgments; but Mitsuye Endo, after a 
lengthy battle through lesser courts, was de-
termined to be ‘‘loyal’’ and allowed to leave 
the Topaz, Utah, facility. 
Justice Murphy of the Supreme Court ex-
pressed the following opinion in Ex parte 
Mitsuye Endo: 
I join in the opinion of the Court, but I am 
of the view that detention in Relocation Cen-
ters of persons of Japanese ancestry regard-
less of loyalty is not only unauthorized by 
Congress or the Executive but is another ex-
ample of the unconstitutional resort to racism 
inherent in the entire evacuation program. As 
stated more fully in my dissenting opinion in 
Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu v. United States, 
323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, racial discrimina-
tion of this nature bears no reasonable relation 
to military necessity and is utterly foreign to 
the ideals and traditions of the American peo-
ple. 
In 1988, Congress passed, and President 
Reagan signed, Public Law 100–383—the 
Civil Liberties Act of 1988—that acknowledged 
the injustice of ‘‘internment,’’ apologized for it, 
and provided a $20,000 cash payment to each 
person who was incarcerated. 
One of the most stunning ironies in this epi-
sode of denied civil liberties was articulated by 
an internee who, when told that Japanese 
Americans were put in those camps for their 
own protection, countered ‘‘If we were put 
there for our protection, why were the guns at 
the guard towers pointed inward, instead of 
outward?’’ 
Asian Americans and Asian immigrants also 
have suffered systematic exclusion from the 
political process and it has taken a series of 
reforms, including repeal of the Chinese Ex-
clusion Act in 1943, and passage of amend-
ments strengthening the Voting Rights Act

three decades later, to fully extend the fran-
chise to Asian Americans. It was with this his-
tory in mind that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
was designed to make the right to vote a re-
ality for all Americans. 
Despite this track record of suffering familiar 
to all minority groups in America, we must not 
forget the positive history of Asian Americans. 
Congresswoman MENG, the sponsor of this 
bill, put it best when she recalled how: 
‘‘Chinese Americans fought for the Union at 
the Battles of Antietam and Gettysburg during 
the American Civil War and Japanese Ameri-
cans comprised the 442nd Regimental Com-
bat Team during World War II, which became 
the most decorated unit in the history of the 
U.S. Military.’’ 
‘‘While Chinese and Japanese Americans 
have demonstrated valor and bravery, they 
have also faced institutionalized disenfran-
chisement that manifested in U.S. laws such 
as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Executive 
Order 9066 that ordered the internment of 
Japanese Americans during World War II. Yet, 
from the first wave of Southeast Asian refu-
gees on our shores to the Filipino Americans 
who helped found the farmworker labor move-
ment—AAPIs have left an indelible mark on 
our American story.’’ 
‘‘From these Halls of Congress to every 
American classroom, our AAPI heroes such as 
Grace Lee Boggs—a human rights activist for 
seven decades; Larry Itliong—the quintessen-
tial leader for labor rights and justice; Dalip 
Singh Saund—the first Asian American elect-
ed to Congress; and Patsy Mink—the first 
woman of color elected to Congress, and the 
original champion of Title IX protections in the 
Higher Education Act, have fought for human 
and civil rights and social justice with their 
every breath. Shamefully, these stories are 
starkly missing from the narrative of American 
history.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, these stories must not con-
tinue to be unknown to so many Americans. 
This bill would put an end to that shameful 
practice, so I am proud to support it and urge 
my colleagues to as well.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS 
OF 
THE 
GABRIEL 
A. 
RODRIGUEZ 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
POST NO. 1928 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today it is our honor to recognize the con-
tributions and service of the Gabriel A. Rodri-
guez American Legion Post No. 1928 as they 
celebrate their first annual dinner this April. 
American Legion Post No. 1928 was char-
tered in 1986 and for the last 36 years has 
honored the American Legion’s foundational 
pillars of programs and activities that support 
Americanism, National Security, Children & 
Youth, and Veteran Affairs & Rehabilitation. 
Just a few months after the Post was found-
ed by Hispanic American veterans in Western 
New York, the Legion was renamed the Ga-
briel A. Rodriguez American Legion Post No. 
1928, in honor of their fallen Vietnam War vet-
eran, friend and brother affectionately known 
as Gabe. 
As a member of the United States Army’s 
25th Infantry Division, Gabriel Rodriguez spent 
over a year in the Qui Nhon region of the Re-
public of Vietnam. But his service didn’t stop 
there. Upon his return home he joined the 
New York National Guard where he would 
serve from 1971 to 1977. 
Gabe suffered from Post Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) as a result of his wartime ex-
periences which led to his passing in 1981. To 
honor his legacy, the Gabriel A. Rodriguez 
Post serves as a place of comfort and com-
munity for all veterans including those experi-
encing PTSD today. 
The Gabriel A. Rodriguez American Legion 
Post members’ commitment to serving vet-
erans and the community is impactful and un-
wavering. They helped lead the national push 
to award the Borinqueneers the Congressional 
Gold Medal, organized food distribution events 
during the pandemic, and regularly reach out 
to help fellow veterans receive the benefits 
and medals they’ve earned. 
Madam Speaker, for the members of the 
Gabriel A. Rodriguez American Legion Post 
No. 1928, a commitment to service didn’t end 
following their honorable discharge from duty. 
It continues today and our community and 
country are better thanks to their ongoing care 
and efforts.

CELEBRATING ODESSA’S 120TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 120th 
anniversary of the founding of Odessa, Wash-
ington. To outsiders, Odessa may seem like a 
small rural town in Eastern Washington, but to 
those of us who know it well, it is a town full 
of entrepreneurial spirit, love for America, and 
passionate people—past and present. 
First settled in the 1880s by cattlemen, 
Odessa is nestled in the Channeled Scab 
lands of Eastern Washington, which is one of 
the seven wonders of the Evergreen State. 
Shortly after, the Great Northern Railroad was 
built, and railroad officials sought to attract im-
migrants to buy up land, grow wheat, and ship 
the crop by rail. This transformed the town 
from a painted sign to a booming economy. 
Homesteader George Finney, seeing the 
potential for greatness, donated his land to es-
tablish Odessa in 1899. He was right. In just 
a few short years, more immigrants arrived, 
participating in the local economy and growing 
the town culturally and spiritually. 
Today, Odessa is a vibrant community that 
more than 1,000 residents call home. The 
town’s rich tradition of hard work and grit 
makes it a shining example of small town 
America and the hope of a better future. With 
approximately 80 percent of Odessa residents 
able to trace their ancestry to the Black Sea 
and Volga Germans, the town will celebrate 
their 51st annual Deutschesfest this Sep-
tember with authentic German food, live 
music, a city-block large biergarten, parades, 
and a street fair. 
As the representative in Congress for this 
one-of-a-kind town, I am so inspired by Odes-
sa’s dedication to keeping its heritage alive 
through education. The residents are com-
mitted to ensuring their kids become the next 
generation of leaders and entrepreneurs, just 
like their ancestors. On this most special day, 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Odessa’s 120 years of remarkable history and 
celebrating their personification of the Amer-
ican spirit.

IN CELEBRATION OF HENRY 
THACKER ‘‘HARRY’’ BURLEIGH 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
contributions 
of 
Henry 
Thacker 
‘‘Harry’’ 
Burleigh of the great state of New York. The 
newly christened Harry T. Burleigh Place in 
Gramercy Park celebrates a man who dedi-
cated his life to enhancing lives through music 
singing, composing and social justice. This 
well-deserving recognition honors the indelible 
impact Mr. Burleigh, known widely as the Fa-
ther of Spiritual Music, left on New York and 
communities around the world. 
Born in 1866 and growing up in Erie, Penn-
sylvania as a young African-American baritone 
singer, Harry Burleigh traveled to New York 
City and applied to the National Conservatory 
of Music to study with well-known Director and 
composer, Antonin Dvorak. His exceptional 
talent was recognized, and a scholarship 
awarded to Mr. Burleigh in 1892 enabled him 
to gain experience editing recordings and de-
veloping his classical spirituals. One of these 
was ‘‘Deep River’’ a spiritual composition from 
1917 which is recognized all over the world to 
this day. 
Tragically, Mr. Burleigh’s life was spent 
under the heinous abuses of Jim Crow, and 
the systemic discrimination of ‘‘separate but 
equal’’ endemic to it. Yet in the face of these 
challenges to his rights and liberties, Mr. 
Burleigh always led with his talents and tire-
less work ethic, earning him many glowing ac-
complishments throughout his life. In 1894, 
Mr. Burleigh auditioned at St. George’s Epis-
copal Church at 4 Rutherford Place in Manhat-
tan, which still stands proudly today within my 
district 
and 
holds 
concerts 
celebrating 
Burleigh’s 
compositions 
annually. 
Church 
member 
J.P. 
Morgan 
insisted 
that 
St. 
George’s hire Mr. Burleigh, and so became 
the church’s Choral Director. He would con-
tinue to introduce and play his classical spir-
itual music there for 52 years. Concurrently he 
integrated Temple Emanu-El, now Congrega-
tion Emanu-El, for a quarter of a century. In 
1895, Mr. Burleigh made it a point to person-
ally test the strength of newly passed civil 
rights laws in New York by asking for service 
at 25 establishments. 
From 1908 onward, he sang for King Ed-
ward VII in London, performed on Mayor La 
Guardia’s weekly radio show Talk to the Peo-
ple, and composed over 200 pieces encom-
passing the classical spiritual music genre. 
The renowned Dvorak’ Symphony No. 9 (From 
the New World) credits the incorporation’ and 
soulfulness of Burleigh’s spiritual works. Mr. 
Burleigh was also a distinguished chartered 
member of the American Society of Com-
posers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) be-
stowed with great public honors. He received

the 1917 N.A.A.C.P. Spingarn Achievement 
Medal, and honorary Doctorate of Music from 
Howard University and Atlanta University in 
1920. In addition, Mr. Burleigh mentored Paul 
Robeson, Marion Anderson, Roland Hayes 
and Enrico Caruso who would go on to make 
their own exciting contributions to our nation’s 
musical story. 
Mr. Burleigh’s legacy of social justice lives 
on through The Harry T. Burleigh Society. 
Formed 
in 
2017, 
the 
society 
continues 
Burleigh’s 
important 
legacy 
of 
disrupting 
boundaries and challenging social norms to 
address issues of our time. The Center for 
Peace, Equity & Justice at Friends Seminary 
School in New York City, coordinated an edu-
cation/postcard campaign that was sent to 
Community Board Six in Manhattan, further 
highlighting his importance in American social 
justice to our beloved city. 
The co-naming on September 12, 2021 at 
the South East corner of 16th Street and Third 
Avenue, Harry T. Burleigh Place, stands now 
as a testament to his important work as a bari-
tone soloist, choral director, music arranger, 
editor, mentor, and a New York Community 
leader. 
Harry Burleigh contributed so much to New 
York and the world, adding his sonorous and 
unique brand of spiritual signing to our ever- 
growing chorus of American culture. I am 
pleased to add my own voice to that chorus 
today in recognition and remembrance of this 
great man.

CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF THE 
PARTNERSHIP 
OF 
DOUGLAS 
COUNTY GOVERNMENTS (PDCG) 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 20th anniversary of The Partner-
ship of Douglas County Governments (PDCG). 
The PDCG consists of nine local government 
entities working collaboratively for the greater 
good of Douglas County’s 380,000 residents 
on impactful issues, projects, and programs. 
During the last 20 years, through their col-
lective allegiance to a single mission, the 
group has focused on creating better commu-
nities for their constituents. Since its inception, 
PDCG accomplishments have included: the 
Housing Partnership and the Youth Initiative; 
the Douglas County Mental Health Initiative; 
collaborative emergency management and 
public safety; transportation improvements; 
open space, parks, trails, and recreation initia-
tives; health and human services programs; as 
well as specific public health efforts, such as 
their 18-month COVID–19 Community Re-
sponse. 
In 2017, the International City/County Man-
agement 
Association 
(ICMA) 
nominated 
PDCG for both the Strategic Leadership & 
Governance Award and the Community Part-
nership Award. PDCG also works together to 
strengthen community bonds and protect its 
citizens. It is a privilege to have such an orga-
nization in Colorado’s Fourth District. 
The dedicated members of the Partnership 
of Douglas County Governments serve our 
community in countless ways every day. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
their hard work and determination. 
HIGHLANDS CONSERVATION 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2793, the ‘‘Highlands 
Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2022.’’ 
The Highlands Conservation Act, a bipartisan 
land conservation program funded through the 
Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund 
(LWCF), protects critical conservation areas in 
the Mid-Atlantic Highlands of Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. The 
Highlands is a nationally significant landscape 
that yields benefits and resources to more 
than 11 million Americans. 
A boon to our agriculture and tourism econ-
omy, the bill authorizes the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS) and the U.S. Forest 
Service to work together to help the Highland 
states, local governments, nonprofits and pri-
vate forest and farm landowners to conserve 
the land and natural resources of the High-
lands region, helping to lower costs for local 
farmers and preserve open spaces. 
Since 2007, $70 million in funding has been 
awarded through the Highlands Conservation 
Act Grant Program to the four States, includ-
ing $20 million to New York. The program has 
helped preserve nearly 11,000 acres in the 
Highlands region, including over 4,000 in the 
state of New York alone. 
This bill will improve upon the already pop-
ular land conservation partnership projects 
made possible by the Highlands Conservation 
Act Grant Program. In consultation with con-
servation groups and the FWS, the Highlands 
Conservation Reauthorization Act: 
Reauthorizes 
this 
important 
program 
through 2028 with $20 million in annual fund-
ing. 
Authorizes set-aside funding for the FWS to 
administer the program in a manner consistent 
with appropriations and other administered 
FWS programs. 
Includes a process in which states can peti-
tion for new areas to be included in the High-
lands region, thus allowing for expansion of 
the eligible areas. 
Provides states with more complete informa-
tion of what areas are ecologically connected. 
Allows the petition process to be adminis-
tered on a rolling basis to eliminate possible 
bottlenecks. 
Gives FWS approval authority in the petition 
process, to remain consistent with how the 
program is currently administered. 
Allows the FWS to modernize the science of 
conservation resource values in the region. 
Responsible conservation is important for 
maintaining this country’s beautiful lands. Mr. 
Speaker, the Highlands Conservation Reau-
thorization Act of 2022 achieves such ends, so 
I am proud to support this significant piece of 
legislation and urge my colleagues to as well. 
RECOGNIZING 
JEAN 
HAMIL, 
NA-
TIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF 
THE UNITED STATES AUXILIARY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Jean Hamil for her po-
sition as National President of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States Aux-
iliary. Jean Hamil has had a rewarding career 
in serving the Auxiliary in a plethora of capac-
ities and her work has impacted veterans 
across the United States, including those vet-
erans who are a part of our very own commu-
nity in Buffalo. 
Jean Hamil’s father, George W. Nunnery, is 
a Korean War Veteran who served in the U.S. 
Navy from 1952 to 1973. Her father’s service 
allowed her to become a Life Member of the 
East Seminole County Auxiliary 10139. 
In addition to working as the Auxiliary, Dis-
trict and Department President, Jean Hamil 
has worked on the national level, serving as a 
National District Council Member and the Na-
tional Director of the Membership Program. 
She is also a life Member of the VFW National 
Home for Children and a member of the Mili-
tary Order of the Cooties Auxiliary, which 
works to serve struggling families. 
In addition to being National President of 
the VFW Auxiliary, Jean Hamil is employed by 
the Food Safety & Environmental Compliance 
for A. Duda & Sons, Incorporation as a Man-
ager. 
By combining her lifelong passion of sup-
porting our veterans, with her hobby and love 
of quilting, Jean Hamil formed a small group 
called the ‘‘Quilting Angels.’’ The group cre-
ates quilts for veterans at the Orlando VA 
Healthcare Center, Quilts of Valor-Orange and 
Seminole counties, as well as for children who 
are located at the Safe House center and sen-
iors in Seminole County. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize 
the hard work of Jean Hamil. Her hard work 
and dedication to our veterans throughout her 
rich career is something to truly admire, and 
something to continue to be grateful for as she 
continues her service as the National Presi-
dent of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) 
of the United States Auxiliary.

Schweitzers my friends. Their generous con-
tributions and unwavering commitment to the 
future leaders of our nation is vital to ushering 
in a new era of innovation that will take Amer-
ica to new heights. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing this historic partnership and 
the tremendous impact it will have for students 
in Eastern Washington. I wish them nothing 
but success as they embark on this journey 
together.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL SMALL 
BUSINESS WEEK 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate National Small Business 
Week, which is being held this year from May 
first to the seventh. Small businesses are the 
backbone of our economy and provide so 
many Americans with the means to live their 
own American Dream. 
In my district, Pennsylvania’s Eleventh, over 
half of all workers are employed by small busi-
nesses. At the age of seventeen, I became a 
small business owner and built the company 
over twenty-five years to employ hundreds in 
family-sustaining jobs. 
I know firsthand how important it is to sup-
port a pro-small business environment, allow-
ing them to thrive. I support policies that cre-
ate opportunities for our country’s small busi-
ness owners to take risks with the knowledge 
that their success means success for the en-
tire community. 
America’s free enterprise system and entre-
preneurial spirit have allowed so many to start 
their own small business and live their Amer-
ican Dream. 
As we recognize National Small Business 
Week, we congratulate and show gratitude to 
all those entrepreneurs across our district and 
country. In addition, we thank the employees 
of the Small Business Administration who 
have helped business owners in Pennsylva-
nia’s Eleventh District access vital aid through-
out the COVID–19 pandemic. They have been 
a reliable resource to my staff, and we are 
thankful for their work. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MILLARD 
OAKLEY 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the late Millard Vaughn Oakley, one of the 
greatest Tennesseans I have ever known. He 
passed away on April 21 after an extraor-
dinary ninety-one years of life. He was a faith-
ful husband, a loving father and grandfather, 
an exemplary public servant, and a passionate 
believer in his small town and the surrounding 
region. His legacy will live on in our state’s 
history for generations. 
He was born May 11, 1930, in Overton 
County, where he resided his entire life. Mr. 
Oakley was the son of the late T.M. and 
Cordia Vaughn Oakley and was the youngest 
of seven children. He graduated from Living-
ston Academy in 1947, then attended Ten-
nessee Technological University, and earned 
a law degree from the Cumberland School of 
Law in 1951. He then went on to practice law 
for about 18 years and embarked on a lifetime 
of public service. 
Millard served one term to the Constitutional 
Convention, four terms as a State Representa-
tive, and four terms as Overton County Attor-
ney. His law experience brought him here to 
Washington in 1971, where he served as Gen-
eral Counsel for the U.S. House Select Com-
mittee on Small Business for two years before 
moving back to the Volunteer State to serve 
as State insurance Commissioner from 1975 
to 1979. 
Among his many accomplishments, Mr. 
Oakley was a business leader who played a 
key role in the economic development of the 
Upper Cumberland region. He started in life as 
a shoeshine on the Livingston Square and 
checked out as a multi-millionaire, chasing the 
excitement of the next great business deal, 
opportunity, or challenge. 
If you took a trip to Overton County, you 
wouldn’t have to look far to find someone di-
rectly blessed by Mr. Oakley. That is certainly 
true for me. 
A lifetime ago, he became friends with my 
grandfather, Guy Williams from Fentress 
County. I admired my grandfather a great deal 
and learned much from him. Grandpa Williams 
was the consummate entrepreneur. He had 
successes and failures, but the latter never 
slowed him down. It is likely the reason he 
and Mr. Oakley hit it off so well. When my 
grandfather passed away, I lost a great men-
tor. 
Years later, I became acquainted with my 
grandfather’s old friend, Millard Oakley. In-
stinctively, I was drawn to him, and he was 
kind enough to show me the courtesy of being 
interested in my life. Eventually, a friendship 
grew out of an acquaintance and later this 
friend became one of my most trusted men-
tors and advisers. 
We come from opposing political parties. I 
am a Conservative Republican. He was a 
Southern Democrat, but that never impeded 
his willingness to encourage me or hear me 
out. Our debates and disagreements were al-
ways cordial. There was never a time when I 
did not glean something valuable from a con-
versation I had with him. He cared and be-
lieved in me, and that meant the world. Count-
less Tennesseans would say the same about 
this mighty man. There was not a person in 
the entire town who Mr. Oakley did not en-
deavor to know. Whether you were the gas 
station clerk, a sheriff’s deputy, or a student— 
you mattered to Millard Oakley. 
What I will always miss is his most sincere 
compassion. He gave life to the dreams of 
many. His generosity will live on through his 
numerous funds and scholarships to multiple 
schools and foundations. You’ll find many 
buildings at Cumberland University and Ten-
nessee Tech bearing the name Oakley for 
their strong support of higher education. In 
2015, the Oakleys donated Hartsaw Cove 
Farm, equaling about 1,400 acres in size, 
along with the farm livestock and equipment, 
to Tennessee Tech. That gift was estimated to 
be worth more than $9 million. 
As you venture down Interstate 40 in 
Cookeville and exit to State Route 111, you 
will find yourself on ‘‘Millard Vaughn Oakley 
Parkway,’’ the main thoroughfare into the town 
so dearly loved by this treasure of a Ten-
nessean. Up that State Route, you will find an 
impressive public library giving children and 
adults access to thousands of books and a 
new, magnificent county building, each made 
possible by Mr. and Mrs. Oakley. 
You will also see a modest office in a sin-
gle-story office complex, which is also home to 
the local radio station bearing his name, 
where he worked most days he was in town. 
You will also see First National Bank—his 
bank and a major employer in the region. It 
was through his financial institutions that he 
helped several small business owners expand 
and thrive. 
Today, I sit in the emptiness of loss. I grieve 
in the void left by a giant. There is no replac-
ing Millard Oakley, only honoring him by being 
better, doing better, and leaving this world a 
little better. In memory of a great Tennessean, 
who did it better than anyone I have ever 
known, I pray that we will each take up the 
mantle and leave our communities a little bet-
ter than we found them.

SCORE FOR SMALL BUSINESS ACT 
OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6450 the SCORE for Small 
Business Act of 2022 which would: 
reauthorize $13.5 million for the program for 
two years; 
ensure the SBA prevents abuse and misuse 
of funds; and 
expand counseling and training programs to 
provide online webinars, electronic mentoring 
platforms and online toolkits to better serve 
small businesses. 
The SCORE program provides vital men-
toring and education programs for business 
owners and entrepreneurs. 
SCORE is dedicated to helping small busi-
ness owners plan, launch, manage and grow 
their businesses. The programs volunteers 
also give continuous advice and support to the 
firms. 
Almost 97 percent of businesses in the 
greater Houston area have fewer than 500

employees—the standard to be considered a 
small business—and these collectively employ 
44 percent of the region’s workforce, about 1.2 
million people. 
Houston adds more than 9,200 new startups 
annually. In 2021 startups attracted a record 
$753 million in venture capital funding, up 
from $702 million in 2019. 
The creation of small businesses in Houston 
is likely to keep growing. Last year, real estate 
investment group Roofstock released a report 
ranking Houston among the Nation’s top 10 
metros for startup formation. 
Houston also ranks number 5 among the 
nation’s largest metro areas when it comes to 
the percentage of minority-owned startups. 
Nearly 5,600 startups in the Houston area 
are minority-owned or about 30 percent of all 
companies less than two years old. 
Together, these minority businesses employ 
more than 22,700 workers in the region. 
But in a region where minorities make up 64 
percent of the population, clear inequities in 
entrepreneurship remain in Houston that mir-
ror the rest of the Nation. 
There are currently close to 170,000 minor-
ity-owned startups in the U.S. employing more 
than 700,000 workers and generating close to 
$100 billion in annual revenue. 
Nationally, Hispanics represent about 18 
percent of the population but just 7 percent of 
startup owners. For Black Americans, those 
figures diminish to just 12 percent and 3 per-
cent, respectively. Meanwhile, Non-Hispanic 
Whites make up 60 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation but own nearly 80 percent of the na-
tion’s startups. 
Mr. Speaker, the reauthorization of the 
SCORE program funding is essential to the 
thousands of minorities and women entre-
preneurs in this country. 
People who have been historically disadvan-
taged are the people who benefit most from 
programs like SCORE and we must ensure 
that they continue to receive assistance. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
6450 the SCORE for Small Business Act.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
CAROL 
DAWSON’S 
DEDICATED 
PUBLIC 
SERVICE TO VIRGINIA’S FIRST 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Carol Dawson for her serv-
ice to this country and to Virginia’s First Con-
gressional District. Carol served in several po-
sitions in the Department of Energy during the 
Reagan administration, served across numer-
ous Boards in Virginia, and most recently as 
a prominent member of the Lancaster County 
Republican Party Committee. Carol’s dedica-
tion to service and to citizen-leadership is an 
inspiration to others and I am thankful for her 
tireless efforts for Virginia’s First District. 
Carol has worked tirelessly, not only as a 
federal employee, but also as a state and civil 
servant. Carol served on the board of directors 
of the National Conservative Campaign, as 
well as a member of the Virginia Racing Com-
mission 
under 
former 
Virginia 
Governor 
McDonnell. When I was informed that Carol 
would be leaving Virginia’s First District to 
move closer to her family in Florida, I was 
saddened that this district would be losing an 
outstanding citizen. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise with me 
today to recognize Carol Dawson and her 
dedication to the constituents of Virginia’s First 
District. Carol has and continues to live a won-
derful life, and I wish her the best of luck on 
her future journey in life.

CONGRATULATING 
JEANNINE 
TRUSWELL ON HER RETIREMENT 
AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF UNITED 
WAY OF WELD COUNTY 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the hard work and dedication of 
Jeannine Truswell, who announced that she 
would be retiring after 36 years with the 
United Way of Weld County. Her fierce com-
mitment and vision have improved the lives of 
countless members of the Weld County com-
munity. 
Jeannine began her tenure as the President 
and CEO of the United Way of Weld County 
in 1986, after seven years as the Executive 
Director of the Weld County Partners Men-
toring Youth program. When she took over the 
organization, its annual fundraising was a little 
over $500,000. Through her tireless work and 
determination, the United Way of Weld County 
now raises almost $5 million annually. In 
2011, Jeannine launched Weld Project Con-
nect, a yearly, one-day initiative hosted 
through the United Way that has served over 
8600 people. This program brings awareness 
to problems in the local community, coordi-
nates governmental agencies, and seeks to in-
spire Weld County citizens to help one an-
other. 
Over the years, Jeannine has guided count-
less service projects, genuinely connecting 
and engaging with volunteers as they partici-
pated in various events. With Jeannine at the 
helm of United Way, her focused mission of 
selfless service has brought positive commu-
nity-wide solutions through projects and part-
nerships, including the Weld County Child 
Abuse Coalition and Founding 211 Colorado. 
Further, Jeannine has received recognition as 
A Women’s Place Outstanding Women of 
Weld County and BizWest’s Most Influential 
Business Leader and Woman of Distinction. 
On behalf of the Fourth District of Colorado, 
I extend my congratulations to Jeannine for 
her honorable service to the people of Weld 
County.

ICAL TEAM THAT SERVED AT 
THE

COUNTY 
MEDICAL 
CENTER (ECMC) 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today we recognize the exceptional mem-
bers of the Military Medical Team completing 
a mission at Erie County Medical Center 
(ECMC). 
During their time in Buffalo, New York, this 
team of dedicated and talented physicians, 
nurses, respiratory technicians, and support 
members have extended great compassion, 
risked their own health, and provided life-sav-
ing care to our friends, family, and neighbors. 
Western New York was one of several de-
ployments made by this unit through a Depart-
ment of Defense effort providing assistance to 
civilian hospitals in over 100 cities across the 
nation since the COVID–19 pandemic began. 
Time and again, members of the United 
States military answer the call when our coun-
try and our people are in need. 
Frontline healthcare workers here at ECMC 
and throughout the nation have made great 
sacrifices throughout the pandemic. 
We are deeply grateful to these members of 
the United States Navy for the expertise and 
support they provided during this national 
health emergency. 
Our community and country are healthier, 
safer and stronger thanks to their service.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF CRAIG 
SALO 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Craig Salo for his service 
as the Marquette County Veterans Service Of-
ficer and the Head of Marquette County De-
partment of Veteran Affairs. Through his tire-
less work and steadfast devotion to our Vet-
erans and local communities, Craig has be-
come an indispensable part of the State of 
Michigan and the United States of America. 
Craig Salo was born in Republic, Michigan, 
and graduated from Northern Michigan Univer-
sity in Marquette. In December 1991, he was 
commissioned by the U.S. Army as a Distin-
guished Military Graduate and attended the In-
fantry Officer Basic Course in Fort Benning, 
Georgia. Following the end of his training, he 
served as a Rifle Platoon Leader and Com-
pany Executive Officer in the 4th Battalion, 8th 
Infantry Regiment in Sandhofen, Germany. In 
addition to being deployed in both Afghanistan 
and Iraq, Craig went on to serve 22 years in 
the U.S. Army and retired as the U.S. Army 
Africa G2–X Division Chief in 2014. 
Following his retirement from the military, 
Craig was hired as the first-ever Marquette 
County Veterans Service Officer and Head of 
the local Department of Veteran Affairs. Under 
his outstanding leadership, the Marquette 
County Department of Veteran Affairs has 
proudly served many of our Michigan Vet-
erans, and his work has led to the establish-
ment of many local Veteran programs includ-
ing the creation of the Marquette County 
Phone App and a transportation network for 
retired servicemembers. His efforts have 
greatly benefited the local Veteran community 
and will certainly inspire future successors of 
the position. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Craig Salo for his years of service to our 
country and his diligent work for our Veterans 
and community. Michiganders can take great

WOMEN’S BUSINESS CENTERS 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6441, the Women’s Business 
Centers Improvement Act, to amend the Small 
Business Act and improve the Women’s Busi-
ness Centers program. 
The Women’s Business Centers Improve-
ment Act reauthorizes the WBC program for 
four years, increases the authorization level 
from $18 million annually to $31.5 million, and 
increases the cap on individual center grants 
for the first time since the program began. 
The bill also establishes an accreditation 
program run by the Association of Small Busi-
ness Development Centers to ensure all 
WBCs provide excellent service and coun-
seling and will increase access to resources 
and opportunities for female entrepreneurs 
across the country. 
WBCs help women succeed in business by 
providing training, mentoring, business devel-
opment, and financing opportunities. 
Compared to men, women comprise a 
smaller percentage of entrepreneurs and start 
fewer businesses in the United States. Cur-
rently, only 24.5 percent of startups in their 
first two years are owned by women, accord-
ing to the American Survey of Entrepreneurs. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the chang-
ing face of employment has seen a lot of peo-
ple go into business for themselves. Women 
are part of the entrepreneurial trend in Hous-
ton. Nationally, Houston ranks fourth in the 
number of women-owned businesses. 
In the metro area, more than half (252,000) 
of businesses are minority-owned and 40 per-
cent (172,000) are women-owned. 
Houston is a place where community mem-
bers take pride in their homes and busi-
nesses, and when faced with challenges, like 
Hurricane Harvey in 2017, they come together 
in their determination to move forward. 
Despite these strengths, disparities prevent 
minorities and women from fully participating 
in wealth-building through small business own-
ership. 
These challenges are not unique to Hous-
ton: nationally, women and minorities face dis-
proportional barriers to starting and sustaining 
businesses. 
Women and minority business owners are 
not reaching the size of their male and non- 
minority peers. 
The expansion of funding outlined in H.R. 
6441 will be pivotal to the success of women- 
owned businesses as they continue to grow, 
giving women the resources to reach their full 
potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill because we must support the 
women entrepreneurs of our great Nation. 
175TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
OTTERBEIN UNIVERSITY 
HON. TROY BALDERSON 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, this 
year marks the 175th anniversary of Otterbein 
University—a regionally accredited private lib-
eral arts university located in Ohio’s 12th Con-
gressional District. Founded in 1847 by the 
Church of the United Brethren in Christ, the 
university has demonstrated a long-standing 
commitment to preparing its students for suc-
cess in their careers and in life. I rise today to 
commemorate this momentous occasion for 
Otterbein University and recognize a record of 
excellence in higher education. 
Since its inception, Otterbein University has 
firmly established itself upon the principles of 
lifelong learning and opening doors of oppor-
tunity for its students. A pioneer in a time of 
societal inequality, Otterbein was one of the 
nation’s first universities to enroll both women 
and people of color, 
Today, Otterbein University has an enroll-
ment of approximately 2,600 undergraduate 
students, and 400 graduate students working 
toward one of its several master’s degree pro-
grams. Reaching near and far, Otterbein 
boasts a vast network of over 25,000 alumni 
scattered all across the world. Otterbein main-
tains a strong commitment to its core values 
of opportunity, diversity, equality, and lifelong 
learning. Reflected in its long list of honors 
and awards, Otterbein takes great pride in its 
dedication to community service. In 2015, 
Otterbein earned the distinguished Carnegie 
Community Service Classification—a leading 
national designation for institutional commit-
ment to service. 
The future of Otterbein University is bright 
as it continues to provide opportunities in high-
er education for generations to come. To this 
day, Otterbein embodies its core values which 
have guided the university since the begin-
ning. I am proud to join Otterbein University’s 
faculty, students and staff in celebrating this 
remarkable milestone. After 175 years in high-
er education, Otterbein has much to be proud 
of. Congratulations.

HONORING GREG LAIS, FOUNDER 
OF 
WILDERNESS 
INQUIRY 
ON 
THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Greg Lais, upon his retirement after 
more than 40 years as the founder and execu-
tive director of the nonprofit Wilderness In-
quiry. Greg is a visionary leader whose dis-
ability advocacy, commitment to equity and 
enthusiasm for nature has opened a gateway 
to the outdoors for Minnesotans and people 
across the country of all backgrounds and 
abilities. 
Shortly after graduating from college in 
1978, a lifelong passion for the outdoors led 
Greg Lais and his fellow graduate Paul 
Schurke to start organizing outdoor trips, What 
seemed like a somewhat ordinary idea be-
came a trailblazing endeavor. Building on the 
success of a week-long trip to the Boundary 
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness with a group 
of people with a variety of physical abilities, 
Greg and Paul began ‘‘Wilderness Inquiry’’—a 
transformative nonprofit dedicated to providing 
access to the outdoors through world-class 
wilderness experiences to anyone, regardless 
of abilities. 
Under Greg’s leadership over more than 40 
years, the nonprofit has grown to offer a wide 
variety of trips and experiences, both across 
the nation and around the world, that welcome 
people from all walks of life and all abilities. 
Whether it’s a first canoeing trip down a local 
river, camping in a national park, or exploring 
the farthest reaches of the world, Wilderness 
Inquiry empowers everyone to access adven-
tures. Their amazing team of staff and outdoor 
leaders create trips that are fun, memorable 
and life-changing for students, families and 
business teams alike. 
Greg knew early on that the strength of Wil-
derness Inquiry was its valued partnerships 
with many different organizations. Today, Wil-
derness Inquiry fulfills their mission to share 
the outdoors with everyone with the help of 
more than 100 different entities. Collaboration 
with U.S. Interior Department agencies like the 
National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service on its Canoemobile initiative is 
one of its most successful endeavors. The 
Canoemobile ‘‘floating classroom’’ experience 
works with urban cities and school districts, 
countless volunteers and other organizations 
to bring students from all backgrounds out on 
waterways around the country in beautiful, 
hand-crafted 24-foot Voyageur canoes to learn 
about science, history, geography and culture. 
Based on his own outdoor experiences, 
Greg understands how powerful interaction 
with the natural world is to our health, happi-
ness and desire to protect our natural re-
sources. Through these shared adventures, 
presumptions are challenged, people grow, 
and community is strengthened. I can vouch 
for the fact that these adventures are fun and 
inspiring. But the best proof is in the smiling 
faces of the more than 40,000 people that Wil-
derness Inquiry serves each year. 
Even as he approaches retirement, Greg 
continues to offer his expertise and energy to 
help nurture the next generation of outdoor 
leaders. This week, Greg’s family, coworkers 
and many friends will join him to celebrate a 
remarkable career with Wilderness Inquiry. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in rising to 
pay tribute to the leadership of Greg Lais as 
he retires from Wilderness Inquiry after more 
than 40 years, and in honor of his ongoing 
commitment to conservation, equitable access 
to the outdoors and vision to create positive 
change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E419 
April 27, 2022 
In 1850, four Ursuline Sisters and an 
English laywoman left their monastery in 
Boulogne-sur-Mer, France and traveled by 
ship to the United States, where they estab-
lished the first Catholic schools in the newly 
formed Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, 
Ohio. They had been invited to Cleveland by 
the Most Reverend Louis Amadeus Rappe, 
the first bishop of the diocese and former 
chaplain 
to 
this 
group 
of 
Ursulines 
in 
Boulogne-sur-Mer. 
Within a month of their arrival in Cleveland, 
the Ursulines opened an academy for 300 pu-
pils. As their congregation grew, they opened 
more Catholic schools across Greater Cleve-
land. 
In 1871, Mother Mary of the Annunciation 
Beaumont, the first superior of the Cleveland 
Ursulines, obtained a charter from the State of 
Ohio to establish Ohio’s first Catholic college 
for women. The new college was located in 
the same building as the motherhouse on 
Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue—focused on the 
liberal arts. 
In its first 95 years, Ursuline College had 
five different locations in the City of Cleveland 
before opening its current campus in the 
Cleveland suburb of Pepper Pike, Ohio in 
1966. There, it continues to emphasize the 
leadership role of women in a wide array of 
professions. 
In 1975, the Diocese of Cleveland closed its 
Saint John College and asked Ursuline to ab-
sorb St. John’s Division of Nursing. Ursuline’s 
current Breen School of Nursing and Health 
Professions grew from this strong foundation 
to become a nationally recognized Center of 
Excellence, as designated by the National 
League for Nursing in 2021. Nursing is 
Ursuline’s highest-enrolled field of study, and 
Ursuline nursing graduates today help staff 
Cleveland’s top hospitals. 
In 2000, Ursuline athletes began competing 
in inter-collegiate sports. The Ursuline Arrows 
are now a member program of the Great Mid-
west Athletic Conference at the NCAA Division 
II level. 
Now, 150 years since its founding, Ursuline 
remains the only women-focused college in 
the State of Ohio, and one of the few in the 
U.S. founded and continuously led by women. 
True to its original vision, Ursuline continues 
to transform students for service, leadership, 
and professional excellence. Its thousands of 
alumnae, in turn, bring compassion and com-
petence to their service to others in profes-
sional and community roles including nursing, 
business, law, teaching, historic preservation, 
social work, counseling, art therapy, and more. 
Together, we look forward to celebrating the 
next 150 years of this remarkable institution.

107TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the solemn 107th anniversary 
of the Armenian Genocide. The atrocities 
began on April 24, 1915 and lasted until 1923. 
It is our responsibility to recognize the mas-
sacre of 1.5 million Armenians 107 years ago. 
The Armenian Genocide is an important re-
minder that crimes against humanity must not 
go without recognition and condemnation. By 
recognizing the Armenian Genocide, we pay 
tribute to the perseverance and determination 
of those who survived. We also honor the 
Americans of Armenian descent who have 
helped strengthen our country. 
As a Member of the Armenia Caucus, I 
have consistently supported resolutions spon-
sored by my colleagues in the Caucus in rec-
ognition of the Armenian Genocide, which 
state that it is the policy of the United States 
to commemorate the Armenian Genocide 
through official recognition and remembrance 
and reject efforts to enlist, engage, or other-
wise associate the United States Government 
with denial of the Armenian Genocide or any 
other genocide. We need to remember the 
past and correct ongoing tragedies in front of 
us. 
As part of those remembrance efforts, I am 
also an original cosponsor of the Armenian 
Genocide Education Act, H.R. 7555, which 
would direct the Library of Congress to carry 
out Armenian Genocide education programs, 
including the dissemination of materials to 
state and local education leaders encouraging 
the adoption of Armenian Genocide curricula 
in secondary and post-secondary education. 
I stand with my constituents of Armenian 
descent in commemorating the anniversary of 
the Armenian Genocide. With that, Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in 
commemoration.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6445—the Small Business De-

which reauthorizes the Small Business Devel-
opment Center Program through FY2025 and

H.R. 6445 will authorize the appropriation of 
$175 million for each of fiscal years 2022

awards grants to centers that counsel and 
train current and prospective small-business 
owners. 
The Small Business Development Centers 
Improvement Act would help strengthen the 
SBDC network and allow the center to do 
more to build awareness of their programs 
and services. 
More specifically, H.R. 6445 will prohibit en-
tities other than institutions of higher education 
from receiving new grants under the program; 
allow centers to collect fees related to private 
partnerships or co-sponsorships; authorize 
centers to market their services directly to 
small businesses; and modify or establish pro-
visions related to program funding, operations, 
data collection, and reporting. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
Business Dynamics Statistics, about 97 per-
cent of businesses in the greater Houston 
area are considered small businesses. 
Companies that employ less than 500 peo-
ple collectively employ 44 percent of Hous-
ton’s workforce, or 1.2 million people. 
Eighty-two percent of businesses operating 
in the Houston area have fewer than 20 em-
ployees. Together, these businesses employ 
just under 400,000 workers, or about 14 per-
cent of the regional workforce. 
According to a study done by Self Financial, 
a personal finance service, there are nearly 
170,000 minority-owned startups in the U.S., 
employing over 700,000 people and gener-
ating close to $100 billion in annual revenue. 
The study states that Houston ranks fifth in 
the Nation for minority entrepreneurship. 
Nearly 35 percent of Houston-area small 
businesses employing 50 or fewer people are 
minority-owned. 
And based on demographic trends, these 
numbers are likely to grow as the population 
continues to diversify on racial and ethnic 
lines. 
As a senior Member of the House Commit-
tees on Judiciary, Homeland Security, and 
Budget, I have and continue to advocate and 
fight for funding for the self-employed, inde-
pendent contractors, sole proprietors, and 
small businesses. 
In the early stages of the pandemic, I intro-
duced H.R. 6292, the COVID–19 Small Busi-
ness Recovery Grants Act, to help struggling 
farmers, ranchers, and small businesses that 
suffered an economic loss due to the COVID– 
19 Pandemic. 
Specifically, this legislation would have es-
tablished a $1 billion fund to provide direct re-
lief to eligible parties who were experiencing 
financial losses due to the coronavirus. 
The bill supported the American people by 
preserving the economic viability of small busi-
nesses that have been devastated by the 
COVID–19 Pandemic. 
Entrepreneurship is the backbone of Amer-
ican commerce, especially small businesses 
that are significant drivers of economic growth 
and job creation in the U.S. 
Small businesses provide opportunities for 
entrepreneurs, jobs for neighbors and gath-
ering places for communities. They’re rooted 
in the landscape where they grow, and foster 
local economies, keeping money close to 
home. 
Small Business Development Centers are 
an essential resource for small business own-
ers, especially those who have been histori-
cally disadvantaged. SBDC’s provide them 
with business advising, access to training, 
tools, and resources to help small businesses 
start, grow, expand, and succeed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 6445 the Small Business Develop-
ment Centers Improvement Act because we 
must support our country’s small businesses 
to ensure that our economy is prosperous.

April 27, 2022 
School Association 2021–2022 AAAA Boys 
Basketball Georgia State Champions, the Wil-
liam Henry Spencer High School Greenwave 
of Columbus, Georgia. 
On 
Wednesday, 
March 
9, 
2022, 
the 
Greenwave won the state championship game 
against Westover High School by a score of 
62–42. This was the fifth game of the season 
against the Westover Patriots, and it was an 
exciting end to their series. This historic vic-
tory marked the first state title championship 
for William Henry Spencer High School. 
Their victory in this season’s AAAA state 
championship follows years of frustration, but 
their hard work and determination this year 
came bursting forth into an unbelievable sea-
son of teamwork and athletic excellence. The 
perseverance of the Greenwave, after a 28- 
game winning streak in the team’s impressive 
30-2 record, was clearly shown by this spec-
tacular season. 
This talented roster consisted of seniors, 
Kyrie Deas, Jamie Jackson, and Randall 
Dixon; 
juniors, 
Jonathan 
Holmes, 
Ryan 
Mobley, Jhalienne Drake, Antonio ‘‘TJ’’ Coch-
ran, Tycen McDaniels, Wy’Darius Scott, and 
Vasean Moody; sophomores, Mor-Le’Draeyon 
‘‘Dray’’ 
Duncan, 
Gary 
Gaithers, 
and 
Key’Shaun Sampton; and a freshman, Tony 
Montgomery. 
I cannot put into words the tremendous 
pride that the citizens of Columbus, and in-
deed the entire Second Congressional District, 
have in being able to call this outstanding 
team of athletes their own. They have accom-
plished an incredible feat, one that could not 
have been possible without the tireless leader-
ship and encouragement from their Co-Athletic 
Director 
and 
Head 
Varsity 
Coach, 
Quantavious Allen; Co-Athletic Director, Jo-
seph Kegler; Assistant Coach, the late Doug-
las Cromartie; the Principal, Assistant Prin-
cipal, teachers, and support staff as well as 
their families, classmates, and members of the 
community who believed in them and their 
ability to bring home a state championship 
title. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 people of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District in congratulating and 
honoring these hardworking young men who 
have persevered, sacrificed, and achieved the 
pinnacle of success in basketball—the Geor-
gia AAAA State Championship title.

IN MEMORY OF PHILLIP PITTMAN 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
a patriotic American, Mr. Phillip Pittman. Mr. 
Pittman lived in Versailles, Kentucky and 
passed away on April 6, 2022. 
Mr. Pittman was born and raised in Jack-
son, Tennessee. He was drafted by the United 
States Army in 1966 and attended flight 
school as a warrant officer. Mr. Pittman flew 
the OH–6 on his first tour with the 7th squad-
ron, 17th Cavalry ‘‘Ruthless Raiders’’ at Pleiku 
Air Base, Vietnam. He was commissioned to 
Lieutenant. On his second tour of duty, he 
flew RU–8Ds with the 1st Radio Research 
Company at Cam Rahn Bay Air Base, Viet-
nam. After a 26-year distinguished Army ca-
reer, Mr. Pittman retired as a Lieutenant Colo-
nel. 
Following his active-duty service, Mr. Pitt-
man had a 20-year career with L3 Commu-
nications, supporting SOFSA at Bluegrass 
Station in Lexington, KY. He also was a 
founding member of Honor Flight Kentucky in 
2015. He served as the organization’s presi-
dent from 2019 to 2021 and was an ambas-
sador since Honor Flight Kentucky’s begin-
ning. Honor Flight Kentucky has flown 1,000 
WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam War Vet-
erans to their memorials in Washington, D.C. 
Along with co-founder George Campbell, Mr. 
Pittman believed strongly in providing a mean-
ingful experience for each veteran who was 
able to participate. Through his work with 
Honor Flight Kentucky, Mr. Pittman created a 
lasting legacy of appreciation for our veterans. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot, celebrate his life, and appreciate him for 
his service and sacrifice to our nation. Mr. Pitt-
man exemplified the American spirit through 
his courageous service and his dedication to 
his fellow veterans. I am forever grateful for 
Americans like Phill Pittman.

RECOGNIZING FEDERAL AMMUNI-
TION ON THEIR 100-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an American institution in Min-
nesota’s Sixth Congressional District, Federal 
Ammunition, on their centennial anniversary. 
On this day in 1922, Charles Horn pur-
chased the Federal Cartridge and Machine 
Company in Anoka, Minnesota. Since then, 
they have been manufacturing ammunition 
which has helped American troops fight for 
freedom in every major global conflict since 
World War II, and law enforcement officers 
protect our communities. Just recently this 
year, Federal sent one million rounds of am-
munition to the Ukrainian people to support 
their fight for freedom. 
Currently, Federal employs more than 1,500 
people in Anoka. Since the company’s found-
ing however, Federal has employed thousands 
of Minnesotans and Americans across the 
country, producing billions of rounds of ammu-
nition. 
I want to congratulate the entire Federal 
Ammunition team, past and present, on their 
100-year anniversary and thank them for their 
commitment to Minnesotan and American 
ideals.

IN MEMORIAM OF UMA SENGUPTA 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance 
of Uma SenGupta, a lifelong educator and the 
first Indian American woman elected as a 
Democratic District Leader in Queens. Uma 
passed away peacefully on March 9, 2022. 
She is known for her steadfast commitment to 
ensuring justice, access, and equity for Indian 
Americans in Queens. 
In 1970 Uma moved to New York with her 
husband Suprabhat. Shortly after arriving, 
Uma founded the Rainbow Montessori School 
in Flushing and became its first educational di-
rector. During her 30+ years as an educator 
Uma became a fixture of the Indian commu-
nity in Flushing which led her to make history 
in 2004 when she was elected as a Demo-
cratic District Leader in Queens. Uma used 
her role as a District Leader to encourage mi-
norities, women, and other marginalized popu-
lations to become more directly involved in the 
political process. Because of her vital work in 
this area the number of women, minorities and 
immigrants involved in local politics has in-
creased substantially which is a testament to 
the lasting impact of her efforts. 
Madam Speaker, my constituents and I are 
grateful to Uma for everything she did for New 
York City throughout her long and storied ca-
reer. May she rest well.

ONE STOP SHOP FOR SMALL BUSI-
NESS COMPLIANCE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 4877 the One Stop Shop for 
Small Business Compliance Act of 2021 to re-
quire the Small Business and Agriculture Reg-
ulatory Enforcement Ombudsman to create a 
website compiling small entity compliance 
guides and contact information for individuals 
who can assist small businesses with each 
guide. 
H.R. 4877 will compile information on fed-
eral regulations that govern small business op-
erations onto one website, making it easier for 
firms to educate themselves on the small busi-
ness compliance guidelines. 
Currently, small business compliance guides 
are published on several different agency 
websites, making it difficult for small busi-
nesses that usually don’t have the time or re-
sources to navigate the web to fully comply 
with their responsibilities under new laws. 
The centralized website would not only ac-
cumulate small business compliance guides, 
but it would also provide small business own-
ers with details regarding the appropriate 
agency and staff members who owners should 
contact regarding regulatory assistance. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
Business Dynamics Statistics, 82 percent of 
firms operating in Houston have fewer than 20 
employees. Together, these businesses em-
ploy just under 400,000 workers, or about 14 
percent of the regional workforce. 
Houston also adds more than 9,200 new 
startups annually. 
H.R. 4877, the One Stop Shop for Small 
Business Compliance Act, will make it easier 
for thousands of Houstonian entrepreneurs 
and people across the country to comply with 
the small business compliance guides.

HONORING 50 YEARS OF FAMILY 
MEDICINE RESIDENCY SPOKANE 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th Anni-
versary of the Family Medicine Residency 
Spokane program. 
Serving the Spokane community since 
1972, this residency program is the oldest 
family residency program in Washington and 
graduated the first class of three family medi-
cine physicians just two years after launching. 
Over the last 50 years, interest in the program 
has blossomed and residency classes have 
grown. In 2014, the program grew again with 
the help of the Teaching Health Center Grad-
uate Medical Education funding program. 
The 365 graduates of this program have 
gone on to provide primary care services in 
their communities, taken on leadership roles in 
other residency programs, received prestigious 
national appointments to various associations, 
and some have even returned to the Family 
Medicine Residency Spokane program as fac-
ulty to help mentor incoming resident physi-
cians. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, Family 
Medicine Residency Spokane played an inte-
gral role in the continuation of care delivery by 
serving as urgent care overflow. Their commit-
ment to care helped ease the burden on ur-
gent care facilities and emergency rooms 
across Spokane. They also provided telemedi-
cine care to patients who were unable to visit 
in-person, administered immunizations to com-
munity members during one of the first vac-
cine clinics in Spokane, and stood ready to 
assist in our hospitals. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the many accomplishments 
of the Family Medicine Residency Spokane 
program. They are truly frontline heroes, and 
I wish them the best during this 50th year of 
service and beyond.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Bobbiejo Lazo for re-
ceiving the Veterans of Foreign Distinguished 
Service Award. Bobbiejo has been the depart-
ment of Virginia’s State Service Officer for 7 
years, and previously served as Post Junior 
Vice Commander. As State Service Officer, 
Bobbiejo has built a new organization to assist 
veterans from the ground through hiring and 
training personnel. Over the course of 7 years, 
Bobbiejo was able to lead her team in pro-
viding crucial high-quality support to veterans. 
Bobbiejo served in the Army for 6 years and 
earned her Veteran of Foreign War eligibility 
bravely fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Her bravery has earned her numerous other 
military accolades including the Army Com-
mendation Medal, National Defense Service 
Medal, and Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing the accomplishments of Bobbiejo 
Lazo. Words alone cannot express our grati-
tude for her service and excellent support of 
Veterans. May God bless Bobbiejo as she 
continues to serve her nation and our vet-
erans. I look forward to seeing her continued 
excellence.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF UNION

IN 
BALLSTON SPA, NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Union Fire Company No. 2 in 
Ballston Spa, New York as they celebrate their 
‘‘Old Timers’’ at their annual banquet. This fire 
company has shown great pride in their com-
munity and has served Ballston Spa’s resi-
dents for over one hundred years. 
In 1855, a group of firefighters known as the 
‘‘Star Fire Co.’’ began serving the Ballston 
Spa community. On June 11, 1901, they offi-
cially became Union Fire Company No. 2 and 
have been proudly protecting their community 
ever since. Over the last century, the fire com-
pany has continuously grown and has now ex-
panded to a two story and two bay facility that 
can house multiple apparatuses. In 2001, the 
company had the honor of celebrating one 
hundred years of faithful service to the 
Ballston Spa community and surrounding 
areas. The company also proudly boasts nu-
merous trophies and awards won by their in-
credible team and the department’s band. In 
2019, the company responded to a record 
total of 419 emergency calls, exemplifying 
their unwavering dedication to the safety of 
the Ballston Spa community. 
With the motto ‘‘Ever Ready,’’ the Union 
Fire Company prides itself on its exceptional 
community outreach. In addition to their an-
nual banquets celebrating their past and cur-
rent members, they also hold numerous com-
munity events. Ballston Spa’s youth are a 
major focus for this company, demonstrated in 
their sponsorship of many local sports teams 
and their fire safety lessons for young stu-
dents. 
Union Fire Company No. 2 has shown tre-
mendous dedication to protecting and serving 
the Ballston Spa community. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I am proud to honor 
and thank every current and past member of 
Union Fire Company No. 2. 
BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION 
NATIONAL

EXPANSION 
AND 
REDESIGNA-
TION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of S. 270, the Brown v. 
Board of Education National Historical Park 
Expansion and Redesignation Act. 
S. 270 will redesignate the Brown v. Board 
of Education National Historic Site in Topeka, 
Kansas as the Brown v. Board of Education 
National Historical Park. 
Further, the bill will expand the Brown v. 
Board of Education designation by estab-
lishing additional sites in South Carolina, Vir-
ginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. 
The Topeka, Kansas site has memorialized 
the stories of perseverance for equal access 
to education. However, when Brown v. Board 
of education was litigated at the U.S. Supreme 
Court, it consolidated four other school seg-
regation cases and it is important that we rec-
ognize this through expanding the Brown v. 
Board National Historic Site to each of these 
four relevant locations. 
These cases were Briggs v. Elliot in South 
Carolina, Davis v. County of Virginia, Gebhart 
v. Belton of Delaware, and Bolling v. Sharpe 
of the District of Columbia. 
The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in 
Brown v. Board of Education found that racial 
segregation in public education violated the 
14th Amendment to the Constitution, which 
guarantees all citizens equal protection of 
laws. 
The effect of this decision was the end of 
segregation in public schools, effectively over-
turning the doctrine of ‘‘separate but equal’’ 
established by the Court in the 1896 decision 
of Plessy v. Ferguson. 
Every child has a right to equitable edu-
cation and learning opportunities without being 
limited by their race and other arbitrary or irrel-
evant factors. 
It is incredible how Brown v. Board over-
turned what was a commonplace injustice. 
And in its place formed a new reality where 
every student can learn unhindered by the 
color of their skin or their ethnicity. 
This case changed the course of civil rights 
in this country and set a powerful precedent 
for equality and human dignity around the 
world. 
In memorializing this unprecedented deci-
sion, it is vital we consider the states and re-
spective towns involved in this case. Each of 
the 5 cases contributes its own unique stories 
and backgrounds in the struggle for edu-
cational equity. 
By establishing additional sites and affiliated 
areas in South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, 
and the District of Columbia, we ensure that 
the 5 major cases and locations in Brown v. 
Board are commemorated in each of the loca-
tions that gave rise to this historic trans-
formation. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
S. 270, the Brown v. Board of Education Na-
tional Historical Park Expansion and Redesig-
nation Act.

IN HONOR OF THE BLUEGRASS 
AREA DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the members of the Bluegrass Area De-
velopment District on their 50th anniversary. 
The BGADD is a non-profit organization 
serving over 800,000 residents in the Ken-
tucky counties of Anderson, Bourbon, Boyle, 
Clark, Estill, Fayette, Franklin, Garrard, Har-
rison, Jessamine, Lincoln, Madison, Mercer, 
Nicholas, Powell, Scott, and Woodford. For 
the past 50 years, The Bluegrass ADD has 
provided a regional voice for local govern-
ments on issues such as planning, economic 
development, 
environment, 
transportation, 
homeland security, public utilities, aging and 
independent living, and workforce develop-
ment. 
The concept of Area Development Districts 
(ADDs) originated in Kentucky in the early 
1960’s with the establishment of Area Devel-
opment Councils. These Councils were orga-
nized in all counties and ultimately became 
the model for the Area Development author-
ization in landmark federal acts such as the 
Appalachian Regional Development Act led by 
Kentuckian John Whisman and the Public 
Works and Economic Development Act of 
1963. The fifteen Area Development Districts 
were formed during the period that followed, 
1966 to 1971, serving all 120 Kentucky coun-
ties. The Bluegrass ADD (BGADD) was the 
last ADD to incorporate, filing their articles of 
incorporation on November 8, 1971. 
It is my honor to recognize the members, 
the leaders, and the dedicated staff of the 
Bluegrass Area Development District. I con-
gratulate them on their 50-year history, cele-
brate their many accomplishments, and look 
forward to many years of serving the citizens 
of central Kentucky.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS 
OF 
FREDERICK 
LAW 
OLMSTED 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today we honor the tremendous legacy of 
Frederick Law Olmsted. April 26, 2022, marks 
the 200th anniversary of his birth, a day to cel-
ebrate and reflect on the great impact he had 
in my home community of Buffalo and Niagara 
Falls, New York and across the country. 
When we visit and admire our national 
parks, we owe a great gratitude to Frederick 
Law Olmsted, as he was one of the first indi-
viduals to promote the idea of national parks 
in his 1865 Yosemite Report. He is remem-
bered as the premier landscape architect in 
the United States during the 19th century and 
is considered to be the founder of landscape 
architecture in the United States. 
His work and designs included a plethora of 
different types of landscapes. He worked to 
develop parks and parkways, college cam-
puses, planned communities, estates, ceme-
teries, and recreation areas. 
In our very own community, we see his im-
pact reflected in the Buffalo Olmsted Park 
System; the first of its kind in this country 
which today is recognized on the National 
Register for Historic Places, and in his design 
of the State Reservation at Niagara, the first 
and oldest State Park in the United States 
which preserved public access to the mighty 
and splendid Niagara Falls. 
It was not just the landscapes themselves 
that were impressive, but Olmsted’s philos-
ophy behind his work and designs which were 
visionary and have stood the test of time. He 
believed that landscape designs should pro-
mote community, advance democracy, provide 
recreational opportunities in urban environ-
ments, nurture and invigorate public health, 
and encourage the development of livable 
communities. 
This philosophy was carried out well into the 
20th century by Olmsted’s associates, sons, 
and successor firms, leaving a tremendous 
legacy of historic landscapes that continues to 
benefit all Americans and visitors. 
Madam Speaker, Olmsted’s landscape de-
signs are inclusive, enduring, and embrace the 
restorative value of parks which continue to 
play a valuable role in society today.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ADRIANO BAZA PANGELINAN 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Adriano 
Baza Pangelinan. Adriano was a pioneer of 
contemporary art and esteemed ambassador 
of Guam whose love for our island and people 
has and continues to resonate in countless 
ways. We will fondly remember him as a tal-
ented visionary that has helped shape the his-
tory and revitalize the spirit of artistry for our 
community. 
As a student at George Washington High 
School, Adriano launched a distinguished art 
career at an early age. In the late 1960s, 
Adriano’s undeniable talent, understanding, 
and use of color compelled his art teacher to 
submit several of his works to various national 
and international student art shows. Garnering 
much attention and acclamation from through-
out the world, 17-year-old Adriano was invited 
to the Chautauqua Institute Art Exhibit in New 
York State. Shortly thereafter, knowledge of 
his name and work began to spread. An arti-
cle about him was published in the New York 
Times, he was invited to exhibit a one-man 
show at the San Francisco Museum of Modem 
Art, and he received numerous other exhi-
bition invitations from places such as Japan 
and Texas. 
Passionate about elevating his creative 
skills and work, Adriano earned his Master of 
Fine Arts degree in painting from Southern Illi-
nois University in 1973. By then, he had cap-
tivated a worldwide audience and obtained 
international recognition. Yet instead of taking 
his wisdom and expertise abroad, he chose to 
return home to give back to the very people 
and island often at the center of his vivid wa-
tercolor pieces. Upon his arrival, he took on a 
role as a professor of art at the University of 
Guam up until his retirement in 1993. For two 
decades he served as a teacher and mentor— 
supporting generations of young artists along 
their personal paths of success. Today, the 
distinctive colors, perspective, and character 
embodied in Adriano’s work can be found in 
many local public spaces including Guam’s A. 
B. Won Pat International Airport, the Guam 
Legislature, King’s Restaurant, Pacific Islands 
Club Resort, Guam Hilton Hotel, and numer-
ous other hotels. With themes ranging from is-
land customs and daily activities to architec-
ture and homes, they persist as stunning re-
minders of the beauty that he saw, and we 
can similarly discover, in our lives, history, and 
culture. 
Adriano Baza Pangelinan is an icon of inge-
nuity who continues to inspire emerging artists 
and appreciators alike. My family and I wish to 
extend our hearts and prayers for Adriano, his 
wife Shiela, children Adriano, Carlos, Marilyn, 
Sean, and Dano, and the rest of their family 
and friends, and I join the People of Guam in 
remembering and celebrating his life and leg-
acy of remaining grounded in one’s community 
and roots no matter where their success may 
take them. Though Adriano will be deeply 
missed, he will be welcomed at the Heavenly 
Gates by his dear mother Pilar, father Vicente, 
siblings Cristobal, Abelina, Enrique, and Jose, 
and daughter Filomena, and his love and 
memories will forever remain in the hearts of 
the People of Guam.

HONORING 
REBECCA 
REYNOLDS 
FOR BEING AWARDED THE GOLD 
AWARD 
BY 
GIRL 
SCOUTS 
OF 
MICHIGAN SHORE TO SHORE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Rebecca Reynolds for 
being awarded the Gold Award by the Girl 
Scouts of Michigan Shore to Shore. Through 
her devotion to her community, Rebecca suc-
cessfully secured multiple grants to help pro-
vide funding for modernized technology and 
resources for her peers. 
The Gold Award is a highly prestigious 
honor given out to only a small fraction of Girl 
Scouts each year. Since 1916, the Girl Scout’s 
Gold Award has been the highest possible 
achievement of scouts, typically taking be-
tween 1–2 years of work to obtain. Rebecca 
Reynolds of Gaylord, Michigan, is one of the 
honorees that will be receiving the Gold Award 
through her efforts to create a Makerspace at 
the Otsego County Library. She achieved this 
goal by securing three grants to help mod-
ernize resources available to her peers and 
the public. As a result of Rebecca’s work, two 
3D printers, a CNC Machine, Sphero Robots, 
and many other materials are now available 
for public use. I commend her selfless work on 
behalf of her fellow Michiganders, which will 
surely inspire many to take up interests in 
STEM education. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Rebecca Reynolds for being awarded the 
Gold Award by the Girl Scouts of Michigan 
Shore to Shore. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such dedicated citizens. On behalf of my con-
stituents, I wish them all the best in their fu-
ture endeavors.

April 27, 2022 
NATIONAL LIBERTY MEMORIAL 
PRESERVATION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 26, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 6201, the ‘‘National 
Liberty Memorial Preservation Act.’’ 
Four hundred years ago, ships set sail from 
the west coast of Africa and in the process, 
began one of humankind’s most inhumane 
practices: human bondage and slavery. For 
two centuries, human beings—full of hopes 
and fears, dreams and concerns, ambition and 
anguish—were transported onto ships like 
chattel, and the lives of many forever 
changed. 
The reverberations from this horrific series 
of acts—a transatlantic slave trade that 
touched the shores of a colony that came to 
be known as America, and later a democratic 
republic known as the United States of Amer-
ica—are not fully recognized and remain wor-
thy 
of 
further 
exploration. 
Approximately 
4,000,000 Africans and their descendants 
were enslaved from 1619 to 1865 in the Amer-
ican and thereafter in the United States. 
The institution of slavery was constitutionally 
and statutorily sanctioned by the Government 
of the United States from 1789 through 1865. 
American slavery is our country’s original sin 
and its existence at the birth of our nation is 
a permanent scar on our country’s founding 
principles and documents, as well as on the 
venerated authors of those documents. It is a 
legacy that continued well into the last cen-
tury. 
The framework for the Constitution and our 
country to which we all take an oath describes 
African Americans as three-fifths of a person. 
The infamous Dred Scott decision of the 
United States Supreme Court, issued decades 
later, described slaves as private property, un-
worthy of citizenship. 
And, a civil war that produced the largest 
death toll of American fighters in any conflict 
in our history could not prevent the indignities 
of Jim Crow, the fire hose gatherings, the 
beatings at lunch counters; and the systemic 
and institutional discrimination that would fol-
low for a century after the end of the Civil 
‘‘The mythology built around the Civil War— 
that victory by the North eradicated slavery 
and all of its vestiges throughout our nation— 
has obscured our discussions of the impact of 
chattel slavery and made it difficult to have a 
national dialogue on how to fully account for 
its place in American history and public policy. 
While it is nearly impossible to determine 
how the lives touched by slavery could have 
flourished in the absence of bondage, we 
have certain data that permits us to examine 
how a subset of Americans—African Ameri-
cans—have been affected by the callousness 
of involuntary servitude. 
By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 
black men (10 percent of the Union Army) 
served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and an-
other 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 
40,000 black soldiers died over the course of 
the war—30,000 of whom died of infection or 
disease. Black soldiers served in artillery and 
infantry units and performed all noncombat 
support functions that sustain an army, as 
well. Black carpenters, chaplains, cooks, 
guards, laborers, nurses, scouts, spies, steam-
boat pilots, surgeons, and teamsters also con-
tributed to the war cause. 
There were nearly 80 black commissioned 
officers. Black women, who could not formally 
join the Army, nonetheless served as nurses, 
spies, and scouts, the most famous being Har-
riet Tubman, who scouted for the 2d South 
Carolina Volunteers. 
Because of prejudice against them, black 
units were not used in combat as extensively 
as they might have been. Nevertheless, the 
soldiers served with distinction in a number of 
battles. Black infantrymen fought gallantly at 
Milliken’s Bend, LA; Port Hudson, LA; Peters-
burg, VA; and Nashville, TN. The July 1863 
assault on Fort Wagner, SC, in which the 54th 
Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers lost 
two-thirds of their officers and half of their 
troops, was memorably dramatized in the film 
Glory. By war’s end, 16 black soldiers had 
been awarded the Medal of Honor for their 
valor. 
In addition to the perils of war faced by all 
Civil War soldiers, black soldiers faced addi-
tional problems stemming from racial preju-
dice. Racial discrimination was prevalent even 
in the North, and discriminatory practices per-
meated the U.S. military. Segregated units 
were formed with black enlisted men and typi-
cally commanded by white officers and black 
noncommissioned officers. 
The 54th Massachusetts was commanded 
by Robert Shaw and the 1st South Carolina by 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson—both white. 
Black soldiers were initially paid $10 per 
month from which $3 was automatically de-
ducted for clothing, resulting in a net pay of 
$7. In contrast, white soldiers received $13 
per month from which no clothing allowance 
was drawn. In June 1864 Congress granted 
equal pay to the U.S. Colored Troops and 
made the action retroactive. Black soldiers re-
ceived the same rations and supplies. In addi-
tion, they received comparable medical care. 
The black troops, however, faced greater 
peril than white troops when captured by the 
Confederate Army. In 1863 the Confederate 
Congress threatened to severely punish offi-
cers of black troops and to enslave black sol-
diers. As a result, President Lincoln issued 
General Order 233, threatening reprisal on 
Confederate prisoners of war (POWs) for any 
mistreatment of black troops. Although the 
threat generally restrained the Confederates, 
black captives were typically treated more 
harshly than white captives. 
In perhaps the most heinous known exam-
ple of abuse, Confederate soldiers shot to 
death black Union soldiers captured at the 
Fort Pillow, TN, engagement of 1864. Confed-
erate General Nathan B. Forrest witnessed the 
massacre and did nothing to stop it. 
Madam Speaker, it is obvious that this 
chamber needs to pass this legislation to 
honor these soldiers’ lives. Black people’s 
labor and service must be amplified because 
it often goes intentionally overlooked, and this 
legislation is key in righting that historical 
wrong. 
I am proud to support this legislation and 
urge my colleagues to as well.

HONORING SPECIAL OPERATIONS 
SUPERVISOR VINCENT DULESKY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of one of our finest. 
I would like to commemorate Special Oper-
ations 
Supervisor 
Vincent 
Dulesky, 
who 
passed away on April 1, 2022. Supervisor 
Dulesky was the head of public affairs at the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Yuma 
Sector Headquarters. 
Supervisor Dulesky was born on June 15, 
1974 in St. Louis, Missouri. He was a great 
boxer and earned a college wrestling scholar-
ship. He attended Arizona Western College 
and the University of Phoenix. 
He proudly served this country in the United 
States Marine Corps. He also worked as a 
Border Patrol agent in Ajo, Arizona and as a 
supervisor in Blythe, California. 
My office staff met with Supervisor Dulesky 
a number of times and found him to be very 
informative and professional. He was cheerful, 
friendly and down-to-earth, a real man of the 
people. But what struck them most about Su-
pervisor Dulesky was his sense of duty—the 
feeling that his profession was more than a 
job—it was a vocation or calling. 
But Supervisor Dulesky was not just a great 
athlete and superb law enforcement officer. 
He had a softer side. He bonded with his fam-
ily through his fandom of the Kansas City 
Chiefs. He was a farmer, had pet chickens, 
and loved to cook. And he was constantly 
smiling and laughing—but always accom-
panied with an outstretched hand to help. 
Especially in these times of crisis on a 
southern border, the competence and care 
that Supervisor Dulesky never ceased to ex-
hibit every day will be sorely missed. But noth-
ing can compare to what this loss means for 
his family. 
I would like his loved ones, his beloved wife 
Barbie, and children, Chloe, 25, Jaden, 19, 
Delilah, 11, and Gigi, 10, to know that they are 
in my prayers. Even though I know that they 
do not need me to tell them this, they should 
be incredibly proud of their husband and fa-
ther’s service to our country.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
CARTHAGE 
COLLEGE 
MEN’S 
VOLLEYBALL 
TEAM FOR WINNING THE NCAA 
DIVISION III NATIONAL CHAM-
PIONSHIP ON APRIL 23, 2022 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
congratulate the Carthage College men’s 
volleyball team. On April 23, the Carthage 
Firebirds won the NCAA Division III National 
Championship. The Firebirds played in a 
tough 16-team tournament to reach the top. 
They dominated their competition, beating 
Mount Union College, Dominican University, 
and Wentworth Institute of Technology all 
without losing a single set. 
In the final, Carthage faced #1 ranked 
Springfield College and won, 3 sets to 1. The 
Firebirds succeeded in the regular season and 
the tournament. They earned a well-deserved 
championship—a remarkable accomplishment 
in its own right—but this is Carthage’s second 
championship in as many years. The Firebirds 
defended their title and beat the top-ranked 
team in the country to do it. They played the 
championship at their home arena, where 
Carthage students and fans helped cheer the 
Firebirds to victory. 
Congratulations to Coach JW Kieckhefer, 
the Firebirds team, and the entire Carthage 
College community on this achievement. Best 
of luck to the Firebirds’ men’s volleyball team 
on their future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF JAY ZAVALA 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Jay Zavala, as he is named 
the 2022 Outstanding Citizen of the Year by 
the Falmouth Chamber of Commerce. 
Jay moved to Falmouth, Massachusetts, in 
2000, and has since established himself as a 
pillar of the community through his extensive 
involvement with the town over the past two 
decades. Jay, a veteran of the Vietnam War, 
writes, produces, and hosts the Town of Fal-
mouth’s Annual Veterans Appreciation Break-
fast each year. With a knack for TV produc-
tion, Jay also sits on the Falmouth Community 
Television Advisory Council and works as a 
FCTV production volunteer. 
After being diagnosed with Parkinson’s dis-
ease in 2016, Jay joined the American Parkin-
son 
Disease 
Association 
Massachusetts 
Chapter, and was later elected Vice President 
of the chapter. In recognition of Jay’s advo-
cacy on behalf of individuals with Parkinson’s 
disease and their caregivers, Jay was named 
the 2021 honoree for the third annual APDA 
MA-Cape Cod Optimism Walk. 
Following a career in government con-
tracting, corporate marketing and sales, and 
independent business consulting, Jay applied 
his professional expertise and commitment to 
community service to a series of productive 
pursuits. Jay served as President and CEO of 
the Falmouth Chamber of Commerce, Chair of 
the Continuing and Adult Education Advisory 
Committee of Upper Cape Regional Technical 
School, and Vice Chair of the Cape Cod Com-
mission. Further, Jay has served on the board 
of directors for several local organizations, in-
cluding Friends of Fairwinds Clubhouse, Fal-
mouth Housing Trust, Open Cape Corporation, 
and the Falmouth Economic Development and 
Industrial Corporation. Through his civic en-
gagement, Jay has devoted his life to sup-
porting and bettering his community. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Jay 
Zavala and ask that my colleagues join me in 
commending him for his many years of dedi-
cation and service to the Cape Cod commu-
nity and our country.
