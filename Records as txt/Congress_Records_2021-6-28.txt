AMERICA MUST DEMAND BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, nearly 100 days after being ap-
pointed as the Biden administration 
border czar, Vice President HARRIS fi-
nally visited the southern border at the 
end of last week. It was 800 miles away 
from the crux of the problem, but I 
suppose it is a start. 
Clearly, the Biden-Harris administra-
tion knows that it is facing a border 
crisis. To them, it is a PR crisis. To the 
American people, the Biden border cri-
sis is so real. 
As I have said time and time again, 
the illicit fentanyl that is made in 
China or elsewhere crosses the porous 
southern border and winds up on our 
streets in Pennsylvania. It spurs addic-
tion; it tears apart families; it destroys 
the workforce; and worst of all, it is 
killing friends and neighbors. 
Last month alone, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection intercepted more 
than 900 pounds of fentanyl. In fact, 
border 
agents 
have 
seized 
more 
fentanyl at the border so far this year 
than in all of last year. 
As my friend and Franklin County 
Coroner Jeff Conner just recently told 
me, fentanyl is easy to get and fast to 
kill. This is true in Pennsylvania, and 
this is true across our country. 
Can you imagine what 900 pounds of 
fentanyl means for American commu-
nities, what it means to American fam-
ilies? 
The chaos on the southern border is 
absolutely a crisis for first responders, 
law enforcement, healthcare providers, 
and community leaders on the front 
lines of the drug epidemic in our com-
munities. Every day, I hear from Penn-
sylvanians who have experienced the 
ramifications of this crisis firsthand. 
For them, this is a stark reality. 
Vice President HARRIS says that the 
Biden 
administration 
is 
making 
progress on this crisis. If that is the 
case, what is the President’s definition 
of progress? 
Does the President believe that his 
administration is making progress on 
the Biden economic crisis, as inflation 
spirals out of control and hardworking 
families bear that cost? 
Does the President believe that his 
administration is making progress on 
the Biden crime crisis, as violent 
crimes skyrocket in cities across the 
country and our brave law enforcement 
officers face unprecedented opposition? 
If this is President Biden’s idea of 
progress, we must demand better. 
Once again, I stand ready to work 
with the President and my colleagues 
on commonsense reforms to restore law 
and order and end the administration’s 
border crisis. We must demand real 
progress. 
Lives are depending on our work. All 
of America is depending on our work.

SALUTING DAVID WALLACE 
DOUGLAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to salute David Wallace 
Douglas, 
an 
author, 
environmental 
champion, social entrepreneur, and 
philanthropist. 
He continues his family tradition of 
service. 
His 
grandfather 
was 
Vice 
President of the United States for 
Franklin Roosevelt. He was perhaps 
the most impactful Secretary of Agri-
culture in American history. He was an 
inventor and a businessperson, and the 
extended clan continues that tradition 
today. 
I became acquainted with this ex-
traordinary 
individual 
because 
we 
shared a passion for safe drinking 
water and sanitation. I worked with 
him on our Paul Simon Water for the 
Poor Act and the subsequent Paul 
Simon Water for the World Act. David 
was an invaluable ally and a mentor 
for me. 
It should be noted that David is a 
Renaissance man. He is the author of 
three books and has written widely in 
publications featuring environmental, 
religious, and developmental issues. He 
is the conscience of the United States 
for preserving our natural heritage. He 
was a tireless champion of respect for 
science and public servants like in the 
EPA, the Park Service, and inter-
national development when they were

under assault in the last administra-
tion. 
He has created nonprofit NGO advo-
cacy infrastructure to support his var-
ious missions. From 1986 to 2020 he 
founded and led Waterlines, which pro-
vided technical help and funding for 
over 1,000 water projects in rural com-
munities in 15 developing countries 
around the world. 
In 2005 David founded the D.C.-based 
Water Advocates, the first advocacy or-
ganization devoted to increasing Amer-
ican support for affordable and sustain-
able drinking water and sanitation. 
He has two other time-limited advo-
cacy organizations to further elevate 
national 
and 
global 
attention 
to 
WASH. 
Most recently, David is fighting to 
focus attention on safe water and sani-
tation for hospitals, which impacts 
some 2 billion of the planet’s poorest 
citizens. Try to imagine treating pa-
tients in a clinic where there is no safe 
clean water to wash your hands. You 
can’t. 
David has a gift for creating organi-
zations for a specific time, to con-
centrate efforts and get the job done 
and move on. Some become captive of 
organizations. Not David. He is cur-
rently wrapping up efforts with the 
promise of spending more time in the 
great outdoors and with his family. 
However 
David 
spends 
his 
time, 
wherever he goes, whatever he does 
next, we are deeply indebted to him for 
his leadership and vision. The world is 
better for his service and for his exam-
ple. 
f 
STOP ATTACKS ON RURAL 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge President Biden and 
his administration to back off on the 
attacks on rural America and rural 
Iowa. 
The 
administration 
has 
proposed 
changes to the stepped-up basis tax 
policy, which is, effectively, the death 
tax with a new coat of paint. 
I have heard from farmers all across 
the Fourth District who are concerned 
about these changes, and they would be 
financially 
devastating, 
especially 
when it comes to passing on that fam-
ily farm to the next generation. 
This was confirmed in a recent study 
by Texas A&M and the Agriculture and 
Food Policy Center. It noted that the 
stepped-up basis changes would impact 
98 percent of family farms and impose 
an additional $1 million tax on farms in 
the Midwest. 
It is simple. The hardworking men 
and women of the Fourth District and 
those who feed the world should not 
have to foot the bill for the Democrats’ 
reckless spending agenda. 
The Biden administration isn’t just 
looking at penalizing rural Americans 
with higher taxes. They are also look-
ing at implementing burdensome regu-
lations that will crush rural Main 
Streets and our agricultural commu-
nity in the Midwest. 
Administrator Regan of the EPA re-
cently announced that the EPA would 
look into undoing the 2020 Navigable 
Waters Protection Rule, which re-
placed waters of the U.S. as a smarter, 
more efficient, and more straight-
forward approach to defining what 
waters warrant Federal regulation. 
A return to WOTUS, which allowed 
the Federal Government to regulate 
water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa, 
would force unnecessary and costly 
government regulations on the backs 
of Iowa farmers. There are many places 
the Federal Government bureaucrats 
just don’t belong, and specifically, they 
don’t belong on our family farms. 
When the executive branch’s power 
exploded under the Obama administra-
tion, we saw ridiculous rules imple-
mented and enforced, leading to rising 
costs in the ag industry and snuffing 
out economic growth on our rural Main 
Streets and in our rural communities. 
This attempted power grab ulti-
mately proved why water regulation is 
best left to States and localities. 
Put simply, the Biden administra-
tion’s Big Government agenda for rural 
America includes higher taxes and 
more regulation, but this administra-
tion isn’t stopping at this one-two gut 
punch. President Biden is also looking 
to undermine the RFS and lowering 
biofuel blending requirements. This 
will hurt both crop growers and biofuel 
producers, two industries that are so 
critical to our economic activity in 
rural Iowa. 
At the same time, the administration 
is laughing as they propose spending 
$174 billion on electric vehicles and 
charging stations. A study by Biden’s 
own Department of Energy found that 
four out of every five vehicles will still 
require liquid fuels by 2050. Think 
about that. Four out of every five cars 
in 2050 will still need liquid fuels. 
Why is President Biden taking aim at 
this critical industry? It seems the 
Democrats are shrugging their shoul-
ders, comfortable with turning their 
backs on the rural Midwest, farmers, 
our rural Main Streets. I say enough is 
enough. 
Rural Iowans are already suffering 
from high gas taxes and grocery prices 
due to this incredible inflation, which 
is a direct result of Democrats’ massive 
and reckless spending. Gas prices are 
over 50 percent higher than they were a 
year ago. Our food and energy prices 
continue to rise because of inflation. 
In May 2021, the Consumer Price 
Index increased at a rate that has not 
been seen since the 2008 recession. On 
top of the Biden inflation tax, our 
farmers can’t afford additional taxes, 
more regulations, and other policies 
that will hinder the most important in-
dustries and will stifle growth in the 
rural Midwest, creating a disaster for 
rural Main Streets, our producers, and 
our family farmers. 
Iowa is the breadbasket to the world. 
That is why President Biden must back 
off rural America. Please back off agri-
culture. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST WORK TOGETHER 
FOR PROGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, as 
we reach the middle of 2021, this House 
has made incredible progress, including 
fighting the global pandemic by pass-
ing the American Rescue Plan. 
Already, more than 300 million vac-
cine shots have been administered. 
Communities are opening up, and busi-
ness is picking up, creating jobs and 
opportunity. 
Next month, parents will begin re-
ceiving their monthly child tax credit, 
legislation that will cut the Nation’s 
child poverty rate in half. 
We have a pathway to recovery and 
transformation that offers real promise 
to every American. But underneath all 
of this, our country faces a deep divide 
that threatens to undo the foundations 
upon which our country rests. 
These divisions reached an apex on 
January 6, when our Capitol came 
under attack and five people died. 
b 1215 
The immediate threat to the Capitol 
may have receded, but the threat 
across the country still simmers. 
It is therefore imperative that we 
fully understand the events leading up 
to and including the siege on the Cap-
itol on January 6. 
As someone who was here in the gal-
lery during the attack, someone who 
watched in horror as they rushed the 
Speaker off the floor, who took cover 
as the Capitol Police barricaded the 
door against the mob, who fully under-
stands the cost to our Nation and the 
implications of simply moving on, I am 
personally, deeply invested in pre-
venting such an attack on our Capitol 
from ever happening again. 
The divide in our Nation threatens 
the prospects of our recovery and the 
potential for America to lead on the 
global stage. 
Congress must now work in unison, 
Democrats and Republicans, to insti-
tute the policies we need to prevent fu-
ture acts of domestic extremism. For 
years, I have worked to pass legislation 
like the Domestic Terrorism Preven-
tion Act that would invest in the types 
of programs built to spot and intervene 
in this type of extremism. 
When my friend Republican Con-
gressman JOHN KATKO negotiated a bi-
partisan committee to investigate Jan-
uary 6, he did it because he knew the 
stakes we faced as a Nation. 
The work of the Select Committee 
will be essential to history’s under-
standing of what took place on Janu-
ary 6 and protecting the future of our 
Republic. 
My hope is that the members of this 
committee will be committed to the

f 
NO END IN SIGHT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS was named 
border czar on March 24, 2021. It was 93 
days later when she finally went down 
to visit a border community amidst 
this unprecedented humanity crisis. 
There is just one problem: she didn’t 
actually visit the border. 
Last Friday, Vice President HARRIS 
hopped off her plane in El Paso for a 
few hours on her way to California. She 
quickly toured a border patrol station 
10 miles away from the actual border 
avoiding a visit to ground zero. 
And what do I mean by ‘‘ground 
zero’’? I mean the actual border where 
thousands of migrants are flooding 
across daily, like the Rio Grande Val-
ley sector where over 50,000 illegal im-
migrants were apprehended in May 
alone, which is 128 percent, more than 
the entire El Paso sector. 
Or in the Del Rio sector where every 
afternoon buses on the Mexican side of 
the border pull up and they unload 
hundreds of migrants who cross the Rio 
Grande River in knee-high water. 
I saw it myself firsthand when I vis-
ited the Del Rio sector in June. While 
I was there getting a tour of the actual 
border, a couple of men crossed the Rio 
Grande over to the American side, and 
when they got to the bank of the river, 
DPS agents and I questioned them. 
We asked them where they were 
from, why they were here, and why 
they thought they could get into 
America. They told us they were from 
Cuba and they had come here to work. 
Then they told us something that 
shouldn’t 
surprise 
anyone: 
They 
thought they could get into America 
because President Biden said they 
could come. 
Within minutes, agents of Border Pa-
trol pulled up in a van, loaded with 
other migrants who had crossed down 
river, and away they went. Situations 
like this are happening in the thou-
sands every day along our border. And 
Border Patrol is the one being forced to 
pick these migrants up, process them, 
straining 
their 
manpower 
and 
re-
sources, resulting in our border being 
completely open for criminal illegal 
aliens who want to cross undetected. 
Americans have been hearing about 
this Biden border crisis for months, 
and they see nothing changing. They 
see the cartels are getting rich traf-
ficking these migrants across our bor-
der. And they hear the horror stories of 
children being abandoned and abused 
during their journey to our southern 
border. All of this has a real world im-
pact on Americans. 
As a former county sheriff in Texas, 
I know all too well the second and 
third order effects of an unsecure 
southern border. Americans will un-
doubtedly become victims of crime 
from the illegal aliens successfully 
avoiding detection when they cross. 
Like Ms. Bowie who was run over and 
killed while I was sheriff by an illegal 
alien who had been deported six times 
prior. 
Our open border will strain local law 
enforcement 
and 
border 
State 
re-
sources who are tasked with cleaning 
up the mess. A mess created by the 
Biden administration’s failure to stem 
the flow of illegal aliens pouring across 
the border. 
But it really doesn’t need to be this 
way. The Biden border crisis all started 
when Biden reversed the Trump admin-
istration’s remain in Mexico policy and 
stopped construction of the wall. We 
can get back to operational control of 
our southern border if the Biden ad-
ministration just reverts back to the 
Trump administration’s policies. Until 
then, there simply is no end in sight. 
f 
TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE RE-
SPONSIBLE FOR SEX REASSIGN-
MENT SURGERIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak 
on the recent ruling by the Secretary 
of Veterans’ Affairs to allow taxpayer 
dollars to be spent to provide sex reas-
signment surgeries. I have been a board 
certified urologist for 30 years, so I am 
quite knowledgeable about patients 
who suffer from gender dysphoria. 
Those who experience this mental and 
physical ambiguity may seek care that 
involves years of psychological and 
psychiatric 
evaluation 
counseling, 
years of hormonal manipulation, and 
then multiple cosmetic surgeries. The 
cost of these interventions may easily 
run into the hundreds and thousands of 
dollars. 
Recent numbers cited by the Na-
tional Center for Transgender Equality 
stated there were an estimated 134,000 
transgender veterans in our Nation. 
However, using the American Psy-
chiatric Association’s Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
data from 2019, that calculated number 
appears to be far less. Regardless, the 
new Secretary has mandated that sex 
reassignment surgery be covered by the 
VA. 
Again, I am very empathetic to the 
challenges that these patients face, but 
as a surgeon and a Member of Congress, 
I must question the surgical priorities 
here. The VA is already understaffed 
and overburdened, and now requiring a 
competing array of treatments may 
lead to a delay in diagnosis for serious 
life-threatening disorders. It is an issue 
of resources and priorities. 
There is actually a much heated de-
bate on whether this sex reassignment 
surgery is truly appropriate or bene-
ficial. In fact, in 2016 the Obama ad-
ministration came to the conclusion 
that it was not. In 2016, the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services revis-
ited the question of whether sex reas-
signment surgery would be covered by 
Medicare plans. Despite receiving a re-
quest that its coverage be mandated, it 
refused. It refused to cover it on the 
grounds that we lack evidence that it 
truly benefits patients. 
It is well documented that up to 40 
percent of the transgender population 
will attempt suicide at some point. 
There is no clear evidence that this 
tragic statistic changes anything after 
having sex reassignment surgery. In 
fact, as recent as August of 2020 in the 
American Journal of Psychiatry, it 
states that comparing those with gen-
der dysphoria who had sex change sur-
gery with those who did not, that the 
results demonstrated no advantage of 
surgery in relation to subsequent mood 
or anxiety disorder-related healthcare 
visits or prescriptions or hospitaliza-
tions following suicide attempts in 
that comparison. I could go on with the 
medical statistics, but suffice it to say, 
there is no clear consensus regarding 
surgical intervention in this popu-
lation. 
Madam Speaker, I represent the sixth 
largest number of veterans in any con-
gressional district in the country. 
These surgeries that are required re-
quire complex surgical intervention by 
highly trained surgical specialists that 
the VA does not have, nor has any 
prospect of employing in the future. 
The Nation is already suffering a se-
vere shortage of surgeons. The Amer-
ican College of Surgeons cites severe 
shortages of general surgeons, urolo-
gists, and plastic surgeons. Those that 
we have are needed to take care of can-
cer, bowel obstructions, and limb re-
constructions following battlefield in-
juries, real life and death issues. They 
are not going to jump ship to be paid 
less in a bureaucratic Government-run 
healthcare system. 
We already know the VA is short- 
staffed. They need mental health treat-
ment individuals for PTSD and trau-
matic brain injury from injuries sus-
tained by veterans in battle. We al-
ready have 17 veterans dying a day 
from 
service-connected 
psychiatric 
issues. They do not need to compete for 
resources with those who are suffering 
from issues that have nothing to do 
with being a member of the military. 
We do not have enough psychiatrists 
or psychologists to deal with the trau-
ma that our veterans have faced in 
their fight to keep this Nation free. Is 
it right to divert resources away from 
those who require years of therapy for 
nonservice-connected issues? The an-
swer, I submit, is no. 
Further, gender dysphoria requires 
years of hormonal transitioning, need-
less to say requiring medications for 
anxiety and depression. This increase 
of pharmaceutical needs will further 
strain the VA pharmacy system that is 
already overtaxed. 
But now the Secretary in an effort to 
appease the far left wants to stress the

system more. What are his priorities? 
Secretary Denis McDonough was sup-
posed to fix the VA. So what is his first 
major action? Spending millions in di-
verting resources from our service-con-
nected veterans for nonservice-con-
nected issues. We are bankrupting this 
Nation chasing the far left progressive 
wish list. 
Again, I will say, as a physician, I am 
very sympathetic to those that deal 
with gender dysphoria. I truly do. They 
face many challenges in life, but cos-
metic surgical interventions on the 
backs of taxpayers is not the answer. 
Congressional duties are about setting 
priorities. I ask the Biden administra-
tion to reassess their priorities.

HONORING AMELIA BROWN 
WILSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to report 
some very sad news that late last week 
Kentucky lost a champion, and my 
congressional office lost a friend and a 
true warrior with the passing of our be-
loved 
field 
representative, 
Amelia 
Brown Wilson, at the young age of 39. 
Amelia was born and raised in Mon-
roe County. Like me, she graduated 
from Monroe County High School and 
her family and my family go back 
many 
generations 
through 
Monroe 
County. 
Amelia was someone that I noticed 
coming up along the public school sys-
tem as someone who was going to be a 
future superstar, someone who had 
class, who had brains, who had a work 
ethic, who had charisma. And I fol-
lowed Amelia through her educational 
career. Amelia’s older sister Kelly and 
I played ball together on the varsity 
girls’ and boys’ basketball team of 
Monroe County. We also went to West-
ern Kentucky University at the same 
time. Amelia obviously was a little 
younger. 
Amelia went to the University of 
Kentucky because she was the biggest 
University of Kentucky fan in the his-
tory of Kentucky. She got three de-
grees from the University of Kentucky. 
I don’t know anyone else that can say 
that. Amelia got her bachelor’s degree, 
her master’s degree, and her Ph.D. all 
from the University of Kentucky. 
Amelia worked right out of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky in the Cooperative 
Extension Service as the family con-
sumer scientist for Fayette County, 
which is Lexington, Kentucky, for 
many years. 
Amelia and I always kept in touch, 
and I knew she was someone with a 
very bright future. 
But while Amelia was at University 
of Kentucky, she had to receive a liver 
transplant, and she went through that 
battle. And for the 20 years after her 
liver transplant she battled sickness 
almost daily, but you would never 
know that because Amelia always had 
a positive attitude. 
Amelia was one of the kindest, most 
sincere people that you would ever 
meet. Amelia is someone that everyone 
who met her loved her, respected her, 
and was inspired by her, especially if 
they heard her story. 
Amelia was very active in the Ken-
tucky Organ Donor Program. She was a 
spokesperson for that program and 
gave speeches around the State and got 
thousands and thousands of people to 
sign up on the back of their Kentucky 
driver’s license to be a Kentucky organ 
donor. 
So we will never know how many 
lives Amelia saved because of her testi-
mony and her story that she would de-
liver all over Kentucky. 
b 1230 
When I was elected Commissioner of 
Agriculture 
in 
Kentucky, 
I 
asked 
Amelia to come join me at the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and be my Ken-
tucky Director of Agriculture Tourism. 
She did that. 
Madam Speaker, I had about 275 em-
ployees. I can say with confidence that 
Amelia was the most popular employee 
in the Kentucky Department of Agri-
culture. Everybody loved her. And 
when I got elected to Congress in 2016, 
Amelia followed me. She was the one 
employee who I asked to go from the 
Kentucky Department of Agriculture 
in Frankfort, Kentucky, with me to 
create my new field office in Madison-
ville, Kentucky. Amelia was my field 
representative for the northwestern 
part of the First Congressional District 
of Kentucky. 
Madam Speaker, every county judge 
and every mayor—every elected offi-
cial—Democrat 
and 
Republican—in 
those counties worked with Amelia, re-
spected Amelia, loved Amelia, and are 
saddened by the tragic loss of Amelia’s 
life this past week. 
I can’t say that I have ever met a 
person who was more sincere and more 
inspiring than Amelia Wilson. She is a 
Christian. She is someone who lived a 
purpose-driven life, and she is someone 
who we will all greatly miss. 
Heaven gained an angel last week 
with Amelia Brown Wilson. Our pray-
ers go out to her husband, Allen; and 
her mother, Sarah Faye; and her sis-
ters, Kellie and Keri Jo. 
f 
SECOND AMENDMENT IS 
ESSENTIAL ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, it 
is always unconstitutional for govern-
ment to restrict the rights of law-abid-
ing gun owners, but to do so in the 
midst of a crisis is especially uncon-
scionable. 
Unfortunately, Governors across the 
country, including Washington’s Jay 
Inslee, has used the COVID–19 pan-
demic as justification to disregard the 
Founders’ intent to preserve this right, 
excluding those in the firearms indus-
try from essential worker designations. 
Denying Federal firearms licensees 
the ability to operate under essential 
worker designations not only infringes 
on the Second Amendment rights of 
Americans, but also recklessly ties the 
hands of our law enforcement officers 
who require access to these tools to en-
sure the safety of our communities. 
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 
establishes guidelines for States re-
garding who should constitute critical 
infrastructure workers in the event of 
a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, 
or other man-made disaster. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we have often referred to these individ-
uals as ‘‘essential workers.’’ Likewise, 
the USA Patriot Act defines critical in-
frastructure as systems and assets so 
vital to the United States that the in-
capacity or destruction of such system 
and assets would have a debilitating 
impact on security, national economic 
security, national public health or 
safety, or any combination of those 
matters. 
The Founders were clear in their 
drafting of the Second Amendment 
that the right to bear arms is nec-
essary to the security of a free State. 
In other words, the Second Amendment 
is essential to our system of govern-
ment. 
While essential worker designations 
have been arbitrarily decided and en-
forced from the outset, forcibly shut-
ting the doors of those who enabled 
Americans to exercise their Second 
Amendment rights is obviously moti-
vated by a radical anti-gun agenda. 
There is no question that the fire-
arms industry is vital to the security 
of the American people. The rights of 
Americans, including the rights to 
keep and bear arms, are no less essen-
tial during a state of emergency. In 
fact, the right to defend one’s self and 
one’s home is most essential during a 
state of emergency. States of emer-
gency merit our heightened vigilance 
to protect against unnecessary and un-
constitutional government outreach. 
In 2020, Americans sought to exercise 
their Second Amendment right so they 
could have peace of mind during a tur-
bulent time. As demand rose, Ameri-
cans faced delays due to the unconsti-
tutional shutdowns imposed by Gov-
ernors across the country. 
That is why I introduced the Second 
Amendment is Essential Act. This leg-
islation protects law-abiding citizens’ 
ability 
to 
exercise 
their 
Second 
Amendment rights and prevents future 
anti-gun restrictions that restrict law-
ful access to firearms in times of emer-
gency. 
This act will classify, by law, the 
firearms industry as a critical infra-
structure sector and those it employs 
as essential workers by amending the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the 
USA Patriot Act of 2001. 
Firearms manufacturers and dealers 
should not be forcibly closed by gov-
ernment in a time when demand for

their products is high, and law-abiding 
citizens should never have any of their 
constitutional rights restricted. 
This legislation will ensure the Sec-
ond Amendment can be freely enjoyed 
by Americans when they need it most: 
in times of crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation and ensuring that the con-
stitutional rights of our fellow Ameri-
cans are protected.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, hear our prayers for those 
for whom, not just yesterday, but every 
day is PTSD Awareness Day. We lift up 
our voices on behalf of those who strive 
to endure the constant echoes of their 
trauma: military veterans, survivors of 
abuse, people who serve within these 
very buildings, and countless others 
who 
have 
walked 
through 
the 
firestorms of doubt and danger, the un-
resolved anguish that is post-traumatic 
stress. 
Like the prophet Habakkuk, we la-
ment the unheard cries, the unrelent-
ing fear, the ongoing inner strife, and 
the withdrawal from any form of life- 
giving community. 
God speak Your word to those who 
are so overwhelmed that they accuse 
You of silence. 
God, do not be indifferent to the suf-
fering of those who, they themselves, 
have lost all sense of feeling. 
God reveal Your justice in the tor-
ment of the innocent. 
Lord God, we lay our unresolved 
questions and our unrequited faith be-
fore You. Be our strength and guide our 
steps that they who grieve would once 
again be able to find hope. 
O, God of our salvation, we lift our 
prayers to You. 
Amen.

THANK YOU TO ALL WHO 
RESPONDED ON JANUARY 6, 2021 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the 
House will not be in session on July 6, 
so I am taking a moment now to com-
memorate the 6 months since the at-
tack on our democracy. It happened 
right here at the United States Capitol. 
Right here outside these doors where 
we are standing today. 
I thank the U.S. Capitol Police, the 
D.C. Metropolitan Police, the National 
Guard, and all the Federal police agen-
cies that responded on January 6, 2021. 
Six months later we have not forgot-
ten your bravery, we have not forgot-
ten your sacrifice, and we thank you.

RECOGNIZING BRAD SAWATZKE 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Brad Sawatzke, who 
is retiring as CEO of Energy North-
west. 
A leader to his core, Brad has been an 
invaluable member of the Tri-Cities 
community and has led Energy North-
west into the future with vision, enthu-
siasm, and determination. 
I had the pleasure to know Brad, and 
his impressive resume merits recogni-
tion. 
To earn money during college, Brad 
began his nuclear career as a janitor, 
and over four decades his hard work re-
sulted in numerous leadership posi-
tions. Brad now retires at the pinnacle 
of his industry. What could better em-
body the American Dream than a ca-
reer where grit and merit are so rightly 
rewarded? 
During his tenure, Columbia Gener-
ating Station became one of the top- 
performing nuclear plants in the coun-
try, and the company is leading in 
clean energy innovation by spear-
heading the deployment of advanced 
nuclear technologies. 
I thank Brad and his wife, Kim, for 
their many contributions to Wash-
ington State, and I wish them the best 
in this new, well-earned chapter of 
their lives.

RECOGNIZING LAURA GARCIA 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Laura Garcia for 
being named Teacher of the Year by 
the New Mexico Association of Non-
public Schools. 
Throughout her 12-year career at 
Gateway Christian School in Roswell, 
Laura has been instrumental in edu-
cating many students and instilling in 
them the importance of service before 
self. 
I applaud Laura for her working hard 
every day to build up our future lead-
ers and give them the confidence and 
values they need to find their own suc-
cess. Mr. Speaker, I thank Laura for 
her dedication to her students and her 
diligence in her work. 
Our teachers are crucial in the trans-
fer of knowledge and wisdom to future 
generations. Great teachers like Laura 
build strong leaders and strong char-
acter. An educated nation is a knowl-
edgeable nation, and a knowledgeable

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Laura on

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the Hyde 
amendment. 
For over 40 years, the Hyde amend-
ment, which prevents taxpayer-funded 
abortions has had strong bipartisan 
support. However, the Biden adminis-
tration aims to end this longstanding 
bipartisan tradition by striking the 
amendment in the fiscal year 2022 
budget request. 
The Hyde amendment is one of the 
longest standing Federal pro-life poli-
cies and has prohibited publicly funded 
abortions since 1976. After decades of 
support, it is gravely concerning that 
President Biden has reversed his posi-
tion on this important pro-life protec-
tion. 
I vehemently support life and defend-
ing the unborn. I encourage all my col-
leagues, both Democrat and Repub-
lican, to support this important protec-
tion for the lives of the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
Judiciary be discharged from further 
consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships.

RECOGNIZING DARRELL HARRIS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in recognition of an indi-
vidual in my district who has been the 
true embodiment of Iowa nice and mid-
western tough his entire life. 
Darrell Harris has lived his entire life 
in rural southeastern Iowa. 
Darrell 
grew 
up 
very 
poor 
and 
dropped out of school in the eighth 
grade to help take care of his family. 
Throughout his life, Darrell spent 
time working on the railroad and start-
ed a family farm that is still in oper-
ation today. 
Darrell was lucky enough to marry 
the woman of his dreams and have 
three beautiful children with her. 
Sadly, his wife passed away at a 
young age, leaving Darrell as a single 
father to raise three young children. 
Nevertheless, Darrell kept his head 
down and he worked hard, never asking 
for help and always willing to lend a 
hand when others needed it. 
Darrell’s work ethic, kindness, and 
never-give-up attitude are an inspira-
tion to us all, and I am proud to rep-
resent him in Congress.

GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 391) to authorize a comprehen-
sive, strategic approach for United 
States foreign assistance to developing 
countries to strengthen global health 
security, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 391 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global 
Health Security Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
leased the National Strategy for Countering 
Biological Threats, which listed as one of 
seven objectives ‘‘Promote global health se-
curity: Increase the availability of and ac-
cess to knowledge and products of the life 
sciences that can help reduce the impact 
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether 
of natural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global 
Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address 
several high-priority, global infectious dis-
ease threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, 
multi-country initiative intended to accel-
erate partner countries’ measurable capabili-
ties to achieve specific targets to prevent, 
detect, and respond to infectious disease 
threats, whether naturally occurring, delib-
erate, or accidental. 
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
(SDGs), 
which include specific reference to the im-
portance of global health security as part of 
SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy lives and promote 
well-being for all at all ages’’ as follows: 
‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
particular developing countries, for early 
warning, risk reduction and management of 
national and global health risks’’. 
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
signed Executive Order No. 13747, ‘‘Advanc-
ing the Global Health Security Agenda to 
Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infec-
tious Disease Threats’’. 
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and 
more than 40 GHSA member countries sup-
ported the ‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend 
the GHSA for an additional 5 years to 2024. 
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
leased the National Security Strategy, which 
includes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and 
contain bio-threats at their source: We will 
work with other countries to detect and 
mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the 
spread of disease. We will encourage other 
countries to invest in basic health care sys-
tems and to strengthen global health secu-
rity across the intersection of human and 
animal health to prevent infectious disease 
outbreaks’’. 
(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, 
which includes objectives to ‘‘strengthen 
global health security capacities to prevent 
local 
bioincidents 
from 
becoming 
epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen international 
preparedness to support international re-
sponse and recovery capabilities’’. 
(8) In January 2021, President Biden issued 
Executive Order 13987 (86 Fed. Reg. 7019; re-
lating to Organizing and Mobilizing the 
United States Government to Provide a Uni-
fied and Effective Response to Combat 
COVID–19 and to Provide United States 
Leadership on Global Health and Security), 
as well as National Security Memorandum 
on United States Global Leadership to 
Strengthen the International COVID–19 Re-
sponse and to Advance Global Health Secu-
rity and Biological Preparedness, which in-
clude objectives to strengthen and reform 
the World Health Organization, increase 
United States leadership in the global re-
sponse to COVID–19, and to finance and ad-
vance global health security and pandemic 
preparedness. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) promote and invest in global health se-
curity and pandemic preparedness as a core 
national security interest; 
(2) advance the aims of the Global Health 
Security Agenda; 
(3) collaborate with other countries to de-
tect and mitigate outbreaks early to prevent 
the spread of disease; 
(4) encourage and support other countries 
to advance pandemic preparedness by invest-
ing in basic resilient and sustainable health 
care systems; and 
(5) strengthen global health security across 
the intersection of human and animal health 
to prepare for and prevent infectious disease 
outbreaks and combat the growing threat of 
antimicrobial resistance. 
SEC. 4. GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY AGENDA 
INTERAGENCY REVIEW COUNCIL. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The President shall 
establish a Global Health Security Agenda 
Interagency Review 23 Council (in this sec-
tion referred to as the ‘‘Council’’) to 24 per-
form the general responsibilities described in 
sub-section (c) and the specific roles and re-
sponsibilities described in subsection (e). 
(b) MEETINGS.—The Council shall meet not 
less than four times per year to advance its 
mission and fulfill its responsibilities. 
(c) GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES.—The Coun-
cil shall be responsible for the following ac-
tivities: 
(1) Provide policy-level recommendations 
to participating agencies on Global Health 
Security Agenda (GHSA) goals, objectives, 
and implementation, and other international

quate procedures and standards to account 
for and monitor the use of funds contributed

tion relevant to United States contributions 
to the Fund (as determined by the Inspector 
General of the Department of State, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State). 
SEC. 14. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN AID 
TRANSPARENCY 
AND 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT OF 2016.

SEC. 15. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
Committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
(2) GLOBAL
HEALTH
SECURITY.—The term

supporting epidemic and pandemic prepared-
ness and capabilities at the country and 
global levels in order to minimize vulner-
ability to acute public health events that 
can endanger the health of populations 
across 
geographical 
regions 
and 
inter-
national boundaries. 
SEC. 16. SUNSET. 
This Act, and the amendments made by 
this Act shall cease to be effective 5 fiscal 
years after the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 391, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 391, the Global Health Security 
Act of 2021. 
As the saying goes: ‘‘An ounce of pre-
vention is worth a pound of cure,’’ and 
that is undoubtedly true in global 
health. Pandemics don’t respect bor-
ders and they don’t care about nation-
alities, and we are seeing that play out 
on the front pages of the news these 
days as the coronavirus pandemic con-
tinues to cause severe disruptions 
around the world. 
Over the past few years, global 
health security has become increas-
ingly tied to U.S. national security, as 
evidenced by not only our experience 
with 
COVID–19, 
but 
also 
previous 
pandemics, such as Ebola and Zika, 
both overseas and at home. 
Having a coordinated, whole-of-gov-
ernment approach to prepare for and 
respond to these threats is critical. We 
must build on the lessons learned from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The Global Health Security Agenda, 
which the United States has com-
mitted to, helps countries invest in 
preparedness and strengthens systems 
that prevent, detect, and respond to 
disease outbreaks. 
H.R. 391, a bipartisan bill by Rep-
resentative CONNOLLY and Representa-
tive CHABOT, would institutionalize the 
best practices the United States has 
learned in global health security. This 
bill establishes an interagency review 
council to not only advance global 
health security, but also mandates a 
U.S. Global Health Security Coordi-
nator to manage the U.S. response in 
these emergencies and allow the inter-
agency review council to speak with 
one voice. 
I believe this person should be at the 
National Security Council as the nat-
ural nexus between diplomacy, devel-
opment, and defense. This person would 
help 
build 
capacity, 
apply 
lessons 
learned, and prepare for the future. 
While I am heartened to see that the 
Biden administration has recently ap-
pointed such a person to tackle the 
pandemic that we are facing, this legis-
lation would create a permanent posi-
tion focused on U.S. global health secu-
rity. 
Furthermore, this bill would require 
the U.S. Global Health Security Coor-
dinator to develop a strategy and regu-
larly 
report 
to 
Congress 
on 
the 
progress the United States is making 
toward making global health security a 
core national security interest. 
Finally, this bill outlines a frame-
work to leverage assistance to increase 
contributions from other donors, along 
the lines of the Global Fund, to support 
global 
health 
security 
activities 
around the world. 
This bill passed the House multiple 
times in the past, and is more timely 
than ever as we continue to address 
COVID–19 and seek to prepare our-
selves for the next outbreak. 
So I would like to thank Representa-
tive 
CONNOLLY
and 
Representative 
CHABOT for their work on this legisla-
tion over the past several years and for 
recognizing the vital importance of 
global health security as part of Amer-
ica’s national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
bringing this very timely bill to the 
floor. I want to thank Mr. CONNOLLY 
for his leadership, and Mr. CHABOT, 
who, I think, is trying to get here as 
well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3170 
June 28, 2021 
COVID–19 could end up, at the end of 
the day, costing the global economy 
upwards of $10 trillion. Of course, the 
full impact of viruses like COVID–19 is 
not just measured in economic disrup-
tion around the world, but also in the 
millions of lives that have been lost, 
somewhere upwards of four million 
people. 
COVID–19 has proven viruses know no 
borders, as the chairman said. It is im-
perative the United States work to pre-
vent future pandemics and be prepared 
to respond to diseases with pandemic 
potential. 
So, again, I want to thank my col-
leagues who have been involved in this 
for introducing the Global Health Se-
curity Act and for their work to ad-
dress this important issue. 
This bill ensures a whole-of-govern-
ment approach to prepare for and, 
hopefully, prevent future pandemics. It 
also establishes a new multilateral 
fund that will ensure all countries have 
access to the necessary resources to 
prevent and respond to future out-
breaks. 
Our committee has a history of work-
ing together to achieve bipartisan suc-
cess, but particularly on legislation re-
lated to global health. It is not Repub-
lican or Democrat. This is an American 
issue. It is also a human issue and an 
international issue. 
The Global Health Security Act is 
just yet another example of this great 
bipartisan work that we do and that 
makes me so proud to be a Member of 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the president of 
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
and a valued member of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend, chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee; and my 
good friend, the ranking member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, for their 
generous remarks, for their leadership, 
and for bringing yet again a bipartisan 
bill to the floor of the House, which 
many people think we can’t do, but we, 
in fact, do do. 
I also want to thank the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), my good 
friend, for being my partner in this leg-
islation for 3 years now. 
Our legislation, the Global Health 
Security Act, reaffirms the United 
States’ 
commitment 
to 
promoting 
global health security. 
Prior to COVID–19, there was a 
dearth 
of 
leadership 
and 
strategy 
around U.S. planning for a global 
health security emergency. Now, as we 
start to emerge from the worst of the 
pandemic, we understand just how im-
portant planning is. 
COVID–19 has underscored not only 
the need for a robust Federal response, 
but also the importance of investing in 
global health security and pandemic 
preparedness throughout the world. 
Diseases do not stop at national bor-
ders. 
I am honored and pleased the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee has coa-
lesced around this legislation, which 
offers a bipartisan solution that ad-
dresses deficiencies in the current pan-
demic response effort. It also dem-
onstrates, I think, a commitment to a 
comprehensive 
and 
sustainable 
ap-
proach to global health security mov-
ing forward. 
The bill establishes a Global Health 
Security Agenda Interagency Review 
Council overseen by a National Secu-
rity Advisor, whose membership in-
cludes the heads of agencies relevant to 
carrying out the Global Health Secu-
rity Agenda. 
It establishes a U.S. Coordinator for 
Global Health Security responsible for 
coordinating interagency responses. 
It requires the President to develop a 
global health security strategy with 
specific and measurable goals, bench-
marks, and performance metrics to im-
prove U.S. leadership on global pan-
demic preparedness. 
Finally, 
it 
establishes 
an 
inter-
national Fund for Global Health Secu-
rity and Pandemic Preparedness. 
Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate both 
Chairman MEEKS’ and Ranking Mem-
ber MCCAUL’s willingness to work to 
strengthen 
this 
bill 
as 
it 
passed 
through the committee during our 
markup. We made improvements, with 
their suggestion, in elevating the par-
ticipants of the interagency review 
council in a manner commensurate 
with the scope of the work. We 
strengthened the scope of the global 
health security strategy with lessons 
learned; and we added a multilateral 
Federal fund. 
These improvements are consistent 
with the Biden administration’s Na-
tional 
Security 
Memorandum 
on 
United States Global Leadership to 
Strengthen 
the 
International 
Re-
sponse. This statutory framework is 
not overly prescriptive, and it does not 
prejudge the outcome of the current re-
sponse framework offered by this ad-
ministration. 
Republican and Democratic Presi-
dents alike have recognized the critical 
importance of global health security; 
from President Obama’s role in launch-
ing a global health security agenda to 
President Trump’s National Security 
Strategy 
and 
National 
Biodefense 
Strategy. 
b 1515 
Global health crises are ongoing and 
increasing, and they affect national se-
curity. 
Saving lives from the next global 
pandemic starts now, by investing in 
preparedness before it strikes. 
Diseases, as I said, don’t respect bor-
ders, and global health crises have im-
mense security, economic, and humani-
tarian consequences as all too trag-
ically we have learned from the one we 
are still going through. 
I am proud that the Global Health 
Security Act has passed the House 
three times already, and I hope the 
Senate will act swiftly on this piece of 
legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very timely 
bill. We have seen utter devastation, in 
terms of human lives, and the economy 
being impacted by this. 
We need to ensure, Mr. Speaker, this 
never happens again. There will be an-
other COVID-like virus that will be a 
variant. We need to work with the 
global community to ensure this never 
happens again. 
We also need to find out the origins 
of COVID–19, how this happened in the 
first place. Not for revenge, but to find 
out how it happened so we can stop it 
from ever happening again. 
I give my strong support to this im-
portant 
legislation. 
The 
timing 
couldn’t be more relevant and appro-
priate. I thank Mr. CONNOLLY for his 
leadership and the chairman for bring-
ing this bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
ranking member for his partnership in 
working together to bring this bipar-
tisan legislation to the floor, because 
as we all have found, COVID–19, which 
has caused global disruption unlike 
any other in recent memory, is not a 
Democratic issue; it is not a Repub-
lican issue; it is all of our issue. It is an 
issue for all of us, not just here in the 
United States, but around the world. 
Coming together on the committee, 
as we generally do, is extremely impor-
tant, working together to get this 
done. 
As we begin to see the light at the 
end of the tunnel of this pandemic, the 
United States must seize the oppor-
tunity and learn the lessons and best 
practices from the crisis so that we can 
be better prepared to respond to any 
future and similar threats to the U.S. 
national and global security. COVID–19 
caught America off guard, but the 
Global Health and Security Act will 
ensure that this never happens again. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CONNOLLY 
and Mr. CHABOT for their work on this 
legislation and for recognizing the 
vital importance of global health secu-
rity as part of America’s national secu-
rity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 391, the Global Health 
Security Act, bipartisan legislation which Con-
gressman GERRY CONNOLLY and I introduced 
to strengthen U.S. and global preparedness 
for, and capacity to respond to pandemics, like 
COVID–19. And I want to thank Chairman 
MEEKS
and Ranking Member MCCAUL
for 
working with us to improve this Congress’s 
version of the legislation in committee as the 
bill heads toward enactment.

distancing, working from home, school clo-
sures and worst of all, a horrific death here at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3171 
June 28, 2021 
home and across the globe, COVID–19 has 
taught us, like nothing else has, the full costs 
of a pandemic. It has also shown us just how 
vulnerable the United States is to disease out-
breaks on the other side of the world. A cor-
rupt and opaque health system in China can 
cause millions of deaths here in America. Chi-
na’s 
politically-motivated 
censorship 
of 
coronavirus information early on caused the 
world untold suffering. But a disease like 
COVID–19 could start anywhere, and if it gets 
out, it can become a pandemic. 
That is why, we must help less prepared 
countries identify and contain future emerging 
deadly diseases when they originate, and miti-
gate their impact before they have a chance to 
grow to pandemic scale. 
When Mr. CONNOLLY and I first introduced 
this legislation in 2018, COVID–19 didn’t exist. 
However, we realized that Congress needed 
to support, direct, and provide oversight for 
ongoing global health security work and that 
the proper personnel needed to be in place to 
coordinate our response to an emerging dis-
ease threat. 
The Global Health Security Act supports 
each of these goals. First, it gets personnel 
right. Second, it strengthens Congressional 
oversight over global health security work. 
Third, it provides a Congressional endorse-
ment, and detailed guidance for, U.S. efforts 
to strengthen health systems and pandemic 
preparedness across the globe. 
Witnessing the death toll and the economic 
devastation that COVID–19 brought, I think all 
Americans will agree with me that protecting 
our nation’s health from future pandemics 
must be seen as a national security priority. 
As the United States comes out of the pan-
demic, and America returns to normal, we 
must recommit to leadership on global health 
security and prepare the world to face the next 
deadly disease before it becomes a pandemic. 
So I would urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 391, the ‘‘Global Health 
Security Act,’’ important legislation that reaf-
firms and strengthens the United States’ stra-
tegic approach to global health security. 
This bill directs the President to create the 
Global Health Security Agenda Interagency 
Review Council to be overseen by the Na-
tional 
Security 
Advisor, 
elevating 
United 
States’ global health security to a national se-
curity interest. 
It also establishes the permanent position of 
the United States Coordinator for Global 
Health Security who will be responsible for the 
interagency process for responding to global 
health security emergencies. 
Additionally, H.R. 391 creates a multilateral 
Fund for Global Health Security and Pandemic 
Preparedness to support the Global Health 
Security Agenda and the 70 percent of the 
world’s countries that are unprepared and un-
able to respond to dangerous public health 
threats. 
Protecting our local and global community 
from global health threats is imperative as the 
United States has already exceeded 33 million 
cases of COVID–19 and over 600,000 deaths. 
Almost 3 million of those cases were in 
Texas and Harris county has the largest num-
ber with around 403,000 cases to date. 
My district in Houston has suffered the loss 
of almost 3,000 of its citizens to the pandemic 
of the over 6,500 fatalities in Harris county 
alone. 
The United States plays a vital leadership 
role in the international health security domain 
and the COVID–19 pandemic epitomizes the 
urgency of global health security. 
The Ebola and Zika epidemics in 2013 and 
2015 respectively exposed vulnerabilities in 
the United States’ global health strategy, high-
lighting the need for a designated official to 
coordinate interagency response to global 
health security emergencies. 
Alongside almost 30 other nations, the 
United States started the Global Health Secu-
rity Agenda to address significant global health 
emergencies and threats. 
As such, it is incumbent upon Congress to 
codify the United States’ commitment to ad-
dressing global infectious disease threats by 
requiring the development of a sustainable 
and comprehensive U.S. global health strategy 
strengthened by measurable goals and per-
formance metrics. 
I proudly support H.R. 391 and the ad-
vancement of global health security so we can 
protect our communities, including my con-
stituents in Houston. 
I thank my colleague, Congressman CON-
NOLLY of Virginia, for championing this bill and 
persisting in his effort to strengthen the United 
States global health policy. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 391, the Global Health Security Act 
of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 391, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

TRANS-SAHARA COUNTERTERROR-
ISM 
PARTNERSHIP 
PROGRAM 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 567) to establish an interagency 
program to assist countries in North 
and West Africa to improve immediate 
and long-term capabilities to counter 
terrorist threats, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 567 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trans-Sa-
hara Counterterrorism Partnership Program 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) terrorist and violent extremist organi-
zations, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic 
Maghreb, Boko Haram, the Islamic State of 
West Africa, and other affiliated groups, 
have killed tens of thousands of innocent ci-
vilians, displaced populations, destabilized 
local and national governments, and caused 
mass human suffering in the affected com-
munities; 
(2) poor governance, political and economic 
marginalization, and lack of accountability 
for human rights abuses by security forces 
are drivers of extremism; 
(3) it is in the national security interest of 
the United States to combat the spread of 
terrorism and violent extremism and build 
the capacity of partner countries to combat 
these threats in Africa; 
(4) terrorist and violent extremist organi-
zations exploit vulnerable and marginalized 
communities suffering from poverty, lack of 
economic opportunity (particularly among 
youth populations), corruption, and weak 
governance; and 
(5) a comprehensive, coordinated inter-
agency approach is needed to develop an ef-
fective strategy to address the security chal-
lenges in the Sahel-Maghreb, appropriately 
allocate resources, de-conflict programs, and 
maximize the effectiveness of United States 
defense, diplomatic, and development capa-
bilities. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to as-
sist countries in North and West Africa, and 
other allies and partners active in those re-
gions, in combating terrorism and violent 
extremism through a coordinated inter-
agency approach with a consistent strategy 
that appropriately balances security activi-
ties with diplomatic and development efforts 
to address the political, socioeconomic, gov-
ernance, and development challenges in 
North and West Africa that contribute to 
terrorism and violent extremism.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 567, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 567, the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership Program 
Act of 2021, from my good friend and 
colleague, the ranking member, Mr. 
MCCAUL. I thank Mr. MCCAUL for work-
ing in the spirit of bipartisanship and 
making sure that we get this bill to the 
floor. This bill authorizes and supports 
the continuation of a viable counter-
terrorism program with our allies and 
partners. 
First launched in 2005, the Trans-Sa-
hara 
Counterterrorism 
Partnership 
Program 
is 
a 
valuable 
initiative 
through which the State Department 
works with partner countries in North 
Africa and the Sahel to build more re-
sponsive and resilient counterterrorism 
strategies to better counter threats 
facing the region and our allies. 
Those 
nations 
include 
Algeria, 
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Libya, 
Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Ni-
geria, Senegal, and Tunisia. 
As the nature of the terrorist threat 
in North Africa evolves and permeates 
across borders in remote geographies, 
close coordination and a regional ap-
proach is critical. One of the United 
States’ strongest tools in its arsenal is 
its ability to galvanize collective ac-
tion, employing U.S.-led multilateral 
initiatives for counterterrorism pur-
poses. The Trans-Sahara Counterter-
rorism 
Partnership 
Program 
is 
a 
strong example of that multilateral ca-
pacity. We cannot prevent or respond 
to terrorism by being American alone 
or America only. It must be America 
forward, leading partners to action 
that safeguards our security interests. 
This bill authorizes the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership Program 
and supports its continuation while re-
quiring a clear, multiyear strategy. It 
also requires a plan for the thorough 
monitoring and evaluation of program-
ming to ensure funds are spent wisely, 
progress is assessed, and programmatic 
actions are results-oriented. By doing 
so, we can ensure an effective, regional 
approach to counterterrorism in North 
Africa and the Sahel. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my 
friend and colleague, Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to 
thank the chairman for working with 
me to bring this to the floor. We passed 
this the last Congress, and I hope the 
Senate will pay attention, as this is a 
very important issue. 
In the last year alone, ISIS- and al- 
Qaida-affiliated terrorist attacks in 
the Sahel have more than doubled, 
killing over 4,000 people. 
Just two weeks ago, at least 130 civil-
ians were killed in Burkina Faso in an 
attack reportedly carried out by child 
soldiers. This was the worst attack in 
that country in years. 
As we speak, ISIS and al-Qaida affili-
ates are growing in strength, they are 
increasing in size, they are becoming 
more violent, and they are pushing fur-
ther south into coastal West Africa. In-
nocent civilians are paying the price. 
A military solution alone will not 
stabilize the Sahel. Mali has experi-
enced two coups in a year. This is un-
acceptable and underscores the impor-
tance of U.S. engagement, along with 
our partners, to address governance 
challenges in the region. 
Without adequate attention to the 
root causes of extremism, violence, and 
community grievances, we will never 
meaningfully address security chal-
lenges in the Sahel. 
I want to thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative KEATING, for his support of 
this legislation as well as the chair-
man. This bill will pass again. It is 
time for the Senate to pass it and 
make it into law. 
This bill mandates the State Depart-
ment, the Defense Department, and 
USAID to coordinate their efforts in 
the region, very similar to the Global 
Fragility Act we passed and signed into 
law. 
This will help balance our diplo-
matic, defense, and development ef-
forts to combat instability and ter-
rorist activity in the Sahel. 
The program also works with coun-
tries such as Chad, Burkina Faso, 
Niger, and Nigeria to build their capac-
ity to conduct counterterrorism oper-
ations, prevent the spread of violent 
extremism, and strengthen the rule of 
law. 
We have learned firsthand that ter-
rorists left unchecked and allowed to 
exploit safe havens will pose great 
threats to the United States’ national 
security interest. 
The situation in the region is dire, 
and we cannot afford to squander crit-
ical taxpayer resources, if they are not 
achieving results. This really provides 
for congressional oversight as well of 
the State Department and the Depart-
ment of Defense, in terms of how they 
are monitoring this important pro-
gram. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
chairman, again, and Representative

KEATING for their work. As we have 
seen around the world, COVID–19 has 
made an already dire situation worse 
in this region. 
As humanitarian needs are rising, 
forced displacement has increased and 
local communities are becoming more 
vulnerable. 
In June, the U.N. Under-Secretary- 
General for Peace Operations testified 
to the U.N. Security Council that ter-
rorist groups are trying to capitalize 
on the pandemic to undermine and de-
stabilize governments in the Sahel. 
This cannot wait. I urge the adminis-
tration to work with international 
partners to increase our engagement in 
the region. It is imperative we address 
the underlying drivers of extremism in 
order to truly combat rising terrorist 
activities. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, effective counterterror-
ism strategies across North Africa and 
the Sahel are critical to U.S. security. 
Terrorist attacks orchestrated by ISIS- 
and al-Qaida-affiliated groups require a 
coordinated multilateral response, led 
by the United States in close partner-
ship with nations in the region. A more 
responsive and resilient counterterror-
ism strategy in North Africa and the 
Sahel is critical and crucial to address-
ing the threats that we face today, and 
this bill ensures that this program is 
the most effective it can be in address-
ing such threats. 
I thank Representative MCCAUL and 
Representative KEATING
for bringing 
this bill forward, I urge the Senate to 
get it done also, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 567, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR 
USE 
OF 
MILITARY 
FORCE 
AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3261) to repeal the Authorization 
for the Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3261 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR 
USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST 
IRAQ RESOLUTION. 
The Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 
102–1; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby repealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3261. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 3261, to repeal the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution, authored by Rep-
resentative SPANBERGER. 
Less than two weeks ago, this body 
voted for a bill to repeal the 2002 
AUMF, nearly two decades after it was 
originally passed. By not repealing an 
AUMF and allowing it to remain long 
after it has served its purpose, we open 
the door for future administrations of 
either party to abuse that authority 
and stretch the authorization far be-
yond its original purpose. 
b 1530 
By failing to remove outdated au-
thorities, Congress cedes its Article I 
authority to the executive branch. This 
is contrary to the design of our Con-
stitution, Mr. Speaker, which gives 
Congress the power to make decisions 
on matters of war and peace. 
Today, we debate a bill that would 
repeal an Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force older than the 2002 AUMF. 
H.R. 3261 repeals the 1991 AUMF that 
authorized the use of the United States 
Armed Forces pursuant to the United 
Nations Security Council resolution, 
which was issued in the wake of Sad-
dam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. Yet, 
the 1991 AUMF remains in statute, in 
the United States Code, even though 
our military liberated Kuwait and com-
pleted its limited mission there three 
decades ago. 
By voting this legislation out of the 
House, we continue to demonstrate our 
commitment to reclaiming our author-
ity over war powers. One of the hardest 
decisions any of us can make as Mem-
bers of Congress is whether to send the 
brave men and women of our armed 
services into conflict. While it is a dif-
ficult decision, it does not relinquish 
us of that responsibility. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) for authoring 
this important legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me first say I sup-
port this bill to repeal the 1991 Author-
ization for Use of Military Force for 
the first Gulf war. That law provided 
authority to use our military to en-
force specific United Nations resolu-
tions opposing Iraq’s 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
With the success of Operation Desert 
Storm, the Iraqi troops were expelled 
from Kuwait, and combat operations 
concluded in early 1991, more than 30 
years ago. 
The specific point of this law was ac-
complished. Therefore, there is no rea-
son to leave it on the books. 
It is, in that sense, very different 
from the 2002 Iraq AUMF we voted on 
before. That authority has been used 
consistently since its enactment to ad-
dress terrorist threats in and ema-
nating from Iraq and was most re-
cently used—not that authority—but 
we saw a strike from the President 
against Shia militia proxies in Iraq and 
Syria. Those threats continue to this 
day. Unfortunately, not all can be tar-
geted using the 2001 AUMF. 
Real war powers reform means con-
sulting with our military commanders 
and intelligence experts. It means up-
dating Article I authorities so the 
President can use them to address the 
deadly terrorists who threaten Ameri-
cans today. 
It does not mean repealing old 
AUMFs without replacing them, al-
though for this one, we don’t need to. 
It does not mean telling the President 
just to rely on Article II powers when 
there is no consensus about their 
reach. 
This law, which is tied to U.N. resolu-
tions about the 1990 invasion of Ku-
wait, legally cannot be used to launch 
new military engagements in the 21st 
century. 
I support this repeal. I thank Ms. 
SPANBERGER for bringing this. This is 
an example of how we can work to-
gether to clean up these old AUMFs 
and hopefully move forward with an 
updated AUMF. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), a valued mem-
ber of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of repealing the 
1991 Authorization for Use of Military 
Force. 
Today, we have another opportunity 
to demonstrate that Congress is seri-
ous about reclaiming congressional war 
powers and serious about representing 
the servicemembers and veterans who 
have served our country. Too often, 
they have served under authorities 
that were signed into law decades pre-
viously.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3175 
June 28, 2021 
While the Constitution is clear that 
only Congress can declare war, we have 
steadily surrendered this responsibility 
to the executive branch. Building off 
the House’s vote earlier this month to 
repeal the 2002 AUMF, we are consid-
ering today two additional bipartisan 
bills that repeal other outdated and in-
active AUMFs. 
First, we are considering my legisla-
tion to repeal the 1991 AUMF against 
Iraq. This AUMF was Congress’ author-
ization for the first Gulf war of 1991 in 
response to Saddam Hussein’s invasion 
of Kuwait 30 years ago. The short mili-
tary conflict that took place under this 
authority has been over for three dec-
ades, and we must remove this old, in-
active authority from the books. Re-
pealing this AUMF would help ensure 
that it is not misused or stretched by 
any American President going forward. 
I thank the broad range of Members 
and advocates who have supported this 
legislation and helped bring us to 
where we are today. Representatives 
GALLAGHER, GOLDEN, and MEIJER have 
been critical partners in this effort to 
repeal inactive, outdated AUMFs. We 
come from different political persua-
sions and different areas of the coun-
try, but we share backgrounds in na-
tional security, a commitment to serv-
ing our constituents, and a focus on 
our constitutional responsibilities. 
House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chair MEEKS
and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL are also original cosponsors of 
our bill to repeal the 1991 AUMF. They 
have been instrumental in moving this 
legislation forward quickly, including 
a unanimous vote out of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this 
year. 
I applaud Chairman MEEKS for his 
leadership of the committee and for 
sending a clear message that Congress 
must assert its war powers. Even as a 
Democratic chairman with a Democrat 
in the White House, Chairman MEEKS 
is making clear that this is not about 
a particular President. It is about ful-
filling our obligation as Members of 
Congress. 
Intelligence 
Committee 
Chair 
SCHIFF, Armed Services Committee 
Chair SMITH, State and Foreign Oper-
ations Chair LEE, Rules Chair MCGOV-
ERN, and Rules Ranking Member COLE 
are also original cosponsors of this bill. 
And I truly appreciate the many other 
cosponsors who have been on board 
with this legislation, many of whom 
have served our Nation in national se-
curity roles prior to coming to Con-
gress. 
I also want to thank Congresswoman 
BARBARA
LEE
for her leadership on 
AUMF issues and congratulate her on 
the House voting with strong bipar-
tisan support to repeal the 2002 AUMF 
earlier this month. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Notably, my bill 
to repeal the 1991 AUMF is also sup-
ported by a broad range of foreign pol-
icy and veterans-focused organizations. 
The American Legion, the United 
States’ largest veterans service organi-
zation, has emphasized the importance 
of Congress reasserting its constitu-
tional authority over war powers. In 
addition, I thank the many other orga-
nizations that have been supportive of 
this effort for their endorsement of our 
legislation. 
For years, Americans have been call-
ing on their Representatives in Con-
gress to exercise our responsibility to 
make decisions on war and peace. We 
cannot simply allow AUMFs to accu-
mulate without congressional action. 
We have more work ahead of us as we 
reassert congressional war powers and 
reform, repeal, and, in some cases, up-
date AUMFs. But, today, we can take 
an important step by passing my wide-
ly supported legislation to repeal a 30- 
year Authorization for Use of Military 
Force. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the repeal 
of the 1991 Gulf war Authorization for 
Use of Military Force. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Let me just say, I want to thank the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER) for bringing this repeal. 
It is a real step forward. I also want to 
thank her for her service in the intel-
ligence community over the years, pro-
tecting this Nation from the threats 
that we face. I also want to thank the 
chairman for really exercising great 
leadership on this issue. 
I don’t know the fate of the 2002 
AUMF in the Senate, but I can tell you 
this one, it should sail. It is a very his-
toric moment because it could be the 
first time in my memory that the Con-
gress has finally reasserted its Article 
I authority and cleaned up very out-
dated, old AUMFs. 
I see this as a very positive day, 
working together as Republicans and 
Democrats on reasserting our congres-
sional authorities, reasserting the fact 
that, under the Constitution, it is the 
Congress that has the power to declare 
war, not the President of the United 
States. 
This committee addresses nothing 
more grave than issues of war and 
peace. I think this is, again, a very his-
toric opportunity. 
I know, yesterday, the President did 
attack Shia proxies in Iraq and Syria. 
I hope I can work with the chairman on 
updating the 2002 and 2001 AUMFs so 
we can repeal the 2001 and update it to 
what are the modern threats that we 
face. After all, they are over 28 years 
old. Many serving may not have even 
been born at the time those were 
passed by Congress. 
It is refreshing to see this kind of 
leadership from the chairman coming 
out of this committee. I applaud him, 
commend him. I commend the gentle-
woman from Virginia for bringing this 
measure forward. I look forward to it 
being passed by the Senate and clean-
ing up, as we say, the housekeeping on 
the books. I also look forward to exer-
cising our authorities moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCCAUL for 
working together in regard to this 1991 
AUMF reform that was put forth by 
Ms. SPANBERGER. I want to tell the 
gentleman that, of course, we will 
work together, as I indicated at the 
last debate that we had on the floor to 
repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF so 
that we can deal with those items that 
make sure that we are secure and are 
modernizing and updating what we 
need to do to make sure that we are 
updated and strong moving forward, 
utilizing what the Constitution has 
given us, the Article I authority in war 
powers. I think that is absolutely key 
and essential. 
It is difficult for all of us who sit 
here as Members of Congress, but it is 
our duty and our responsibility that we 
can’t dodge. I think we understand that 
in a bipartisan way, that we are going 
to take up the responsibilities that we 
have. 
Passing the repeal of the 2002 AUMF 
was the beginning of our work of re-
claiming our authority over matters of 
war and peace, and today’s repeal of 
the 1991 AUMF continues that effort. 
Again, Representative SPANBERGER’s 
bill before this Chamber today will re-
move an outdated AUMF and lessen 
the risk that the executive can cir-
cumvent Congress in utilizing military 
force. 
I thank Representative SPANBERGER 
for authoring this bill, as well as the 
support of so many here in Congress on 
both sides of the aisle for defending 
Congress’ Article I authority. We are 
doing this collectively, our responsi-
bility that we are not dodging and not 
giving to the executive branch. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, nearly two 
decades ago, Congress passed a resolution 
authorizing military force against the Iraqi re-
gime of Saddam Hussein. That resolution— 
aided in its passage by deeply flawed intel-
ligence that we now know had no basis in fact 
authorized the use of force for two express 
purposes: to defend the national security of 
the United States against the continued threat 
posed by Iraq and to enforce all relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. It 
has been 18 years since Saddam Hussein 
was deposed. It has been a decade since the 
United States declared a formal end of oper-
ations in Iraq. The Iraqi government is a re-
gional partner and the UN Security Council 
resolutions referenced have been fulfilled. 
In short, there is no virtue in allowing the 
2002 AUMF to lay dormant but active. The 
only possible outcome is for a future adminis-
tration to wield it as a legal loophole to bypass 
the need to confer with Congress before en-
gaging in military operations. Each of us here

understands that the nature of modern warfare 
has changed—it is murkier, dirtier, and in-
volves a variety of state- and non-state actors. 
But that fact should not compel Congress to 
forfeit its constitutional responsibility to directly 
authorize the use of force. It should not pre-
clude any administration from receiving direct 
authorization from the Congress to engage in 
global conflicts. 
Earlier this year, the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee had a productive hearing where 
each of the three expert witnesses testified 
that this AUMF is not necessary. It does not 
enhance our national security. It does not 
make Americans any safer. It does not make 
the mission of our men and women in uniform 
any easier. To repeal this resolution would not 
tie the hands of the current administration or 
any future administration in their responsibility 
to preserve the national security of the United 
States—it would instead ensure that it could 
not be manipulated to take us into a war that 
Congress did not authorize. 
If we fail to act, we run the risk of opportun-
istic legal interpretations leading to a slippery 
slope until our country finds itself on a perma-
nent war footing. Congress did not authorize 
that in 2002. We shouldn’t tacitly authorize it 
by failing to act. Let’s do our jobs—we owe it 
to the American people and to our men and 
women in uniform. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the

REPEAL OF JOINT RESOLUTION TO 
PROMOTE 
PEACE 
AND

Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3283) to repeal the joint resolu-
tion entitled, ‘‘A joint resolution to 
promote peace and stability in the 
Middle East’’, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3283 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPEAL OF JOINT RESOLUTION TO 
PROMOTE PEACE AND STABILITY IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST. 
Effective on the date that is 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
joint resolution entitled ‘‘A joint resolution 
to promote peace and stability in the Middle 
East’’ (Public Law 85–7; 22 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.) 
is hereby repealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3283, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3283 to repeal the joint 
resolution entitled ‘‘A joint resolution 
to promote peace and stability in the 
Middle East,’’ offered by Representa-
tive MEIJER. 
Earlier, I made the case for con-
tinuing this Chamber’s hard work of 
reclaiming congressional war powers, 
started less than 2 weeks ago by our 
vote to repeal the 2002 AUMF and con-
tinued by our debate today to repeal 
the 1991 AUMF and the 1957 AUMF. 
b 1545 
I will keep my remarks short so as 
not to belabor the points I made ear-
lier, as the case for repealing the 1941 
AUMF similarly applies to the 1957 
AUMF, if not more so. 
Going way back, I was barely a tod-
dler 
when 
this 
authorization 
was 
passed, and I have been here for a 
while. The fact that this authorization 
still exists as good law today indicates 
the vital need for Congress to take se-
riously its responsibility over war and 
peace and repeal AUMFs once their 
purpose has been served or expired. 
Good legislative housekeeping re-
quires us not to just authorize force 
when needed to protect and defend this 
Nation, but to recall and repeal au-
thorities when their usefulness has 
passed. 
The Soviet Union this authorization 
was meant to counter no longer exists. 
There is no Soviet Union now. The 1957 
AUMF is a relic of the Cold War. It is 
outdated and obsolete. 
We, as Members of Congress, have 
been granted the responsibility to 
make decisions on matters of war and 
peace by the Constitution, a responsi-
bility none of us takes lightly. How-
ever, for far too long we have failed to 
make those decisions at all. Instead, 
we have ceded our Article I authority 
to administrations that have reinter-
preted old AUMFs. The threat of that 
abuse continues so long as we allow 
these authorizations to remain in the 
U.S. Code. 
I thank again the ranking member 
for working with us to bring this bill 
forward. 
I 
thank 
Representative 
MEIJER for authoring this legislation. 
And I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
First of all, I thank the chairman for, 
again, exercising our Article I con-
stitutional responsibilities. That is 
what leadership is all about, and this 
one is very bipartisan, and again, I 
think historic. Because in my memory 
we have never done this before success-
fully. 
I also thank the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER) for introducing 
this bill to repeal an aging AUMF that 
has never been used in the 64 years 
since it was enacted. 
Now, I have to say, Mr. Speaker, I 
wasn’t even born when this AUMF was 
enacted. Just barely, though. I was 
born not long after that. But that is 
amazing as I stand here at almost 60 
years old. That law gave the President 
authority to ‘‘use Armed Forces to as-
sist any Middle East nation requesting 
assistance against armed aggression 
from any country controlled by inter-
national communism.’’ 
This unused relic of the Cold War 
should not be left on the books or on 
the shelf for a creative President to 
dust off and put to unexpected use. So 
I think we all agree, if a President was 
to commit U.S. troops to new hos-
tilities in the Middle East, he or she 
should come to the Congress for au-
thorization. 
Mr. Speaker, for that reason I sup-
port this repeal, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), a very valued 
member of our committee on the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of repealing the 
1957 AUMF. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Rank-
ing Member, I was also not born when 
this Authorization for Use of Military 
Force was put in place. 
In addition to considering my legisla-
tion to repeal the 1991 Gulf war AUMF, 
I am pleased that we are considering a 
separate bill that I co-led with Con-
gressman MEIJER to repeal an open- 
ended resolution from 1957 that author-
ized the use for military force in the 
Middle East. 
This Cold War-era authorization still 
on the books today is more than 60 
years old, and it provides outdated, 
blank-check authorities to an execu-
tive branch or Presidential administra-
tion that might seek to justify ex-
panded operations in the Middle East. 
It is not necessary, and we must repeal 
it. 
Repealing this resolution would not 
undermine any existing U.S. military 
operations, but it would help ensure 
that its significantly outdated authori-
ties are not used or abused by any fu-
ture President. Additionally, it would 
show that Congress is ready to exercise 
its responsibilities under the Constitu-
tion. 
I was pleased to see this bill pass out 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee on a 
voice vote, and I appreciate Congress-
man MEIJER’s leadership, as well as the 
bipartisan cosponsors who have joined 
him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3177 
June 28, 2021 
It is far past time for Congress to re-
assert our war powers. I welcome the 
bipartisan and diverse coalitions that 
have mobilized around this shared goal 
of constitutional responsibility, Con-
gress demonstrating its sense of re-
sponsibility as it relates to authorizing 
war powers in moving forward with re-
pealing these outdated and unused au-
thorizations. 
We owe it to our constituents, espe-
cially those who have served in uni-
form. While they time and time again 
demonstrate their willingness to serve 
our Nation, there should never be a 
worry that they may be deployed under 
a 60-year-old-plus authority. It is im-
portant that every time we send serv-
icemembers off to war, we here in the 
United States Congress are taking the 
step of being responsible by voting on 
authorizations. 
Today, it is time to vote to take this 
outdated resolution off the books. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing to do so today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), the ranking member 
of the House Rules Committee, a man 
who has dedicated quite a bit of time 
to this issue, and I would say is one of 
the leaders in the House on Authoriza-
tions for Use of Military Force and the 
War Powers Act and reasserting Con-
gress’ role. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas for yielding, and I 
want to be the first to admit I was 
alive when both of these authorizations 
were passed. 
The Congress’ current effort to re-
view the existing authorities for mili-
tary force for which the original pur-
poses have been achieved or are no 
longer appropriate is an important ex-
ercise of this body’s authority under 
the Constitution and pursuant to the 
War Powers Act. 
I am pleased to note that Chairman 
MCGOVERN
and 
I, along with my 
friends, Chairman MEEKS and Ranking 
Member MCCAUL, helped initiate an 
evaluation of the War Powers Act, its 
strength and limitations and its need 
for modernization in a hearing on this 
topic in March. It is fitting, and frank-
ly overdue, that the House is consid-
ering these issues and is now poised to 
repeal a second and third outdated 
AUMF this year with strong bipartisan 
support. 
The joint resolution to promote 
peace and stability in the Middle East 
was enacted in 1957, 2 years after the 
signing of the Warsaw Pact, in re-
sponse to the concerns about the po-
tential spread of communist influence 
in the Middle East and, therefore, 
threats to U.S. economic and political 
interests in the region is long overdue. 
Needless to say, much has changed in 
the 64 intervening years. The Berlin 
Wall has fallen, and six of the seven 
former Eastern Bloc countries are now 
allied with the United States through 
NATO. The Soviet Union, of course, is 
no more. Communism obviously re-
mains in the world, but it is no longer 
the driving force for most threats to 
the United States, particularly in the 
Middle East. 
Similarly, the Authorization for Use 
of Military Force Against Iraq Resolu-
tion of 1991 is not related to the cur-
rent situation in Iraq, and therefore, 
defunct. United Nations Resolution 678 
authorized member states to use force 
to restore peace and order in response 
to Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Ku-
wait in 1990. President Bush stated on 
multiple occasions at the time, includ-
ing in his signing statement of this 
AUMF, that he believed he had suffi-
cient constitutional authority to use 
force in this case. However, he did not 
test the question, and requested and 
welcomed the AUMF. With or without 
the United Nations approval, in spite of 
the action’s intent to enforce inter-
national law and, regardless of my sup-
port for the action taken by President 
Bush at that time, it was the initiation 
of a war, and in my opinion, the Presi-
dent was obligated to seek Congres-
sional approval. However, since the 
issue has been long-since settled, it is 
time to revoke the outdated authority. 
Let us reinforce with this action 
today, Mr. Speaker, that should the 
President find reason to initiate mili-
tary action subject to the War Powers 
Act in Iraq or anywhere in the Middle 
East, he or she must come to Congress 
with information, justification, and re-
quest for approval. 
Also going forward, I strongly sug-
gest this and future Congresses consist-
ently establish a sunset of future au-
thorizations either by a firm expiration 
date in the authorization or triggered 
by satisfaction of clear and specific ob-
jectives. 
Once again, I support the passage of 
H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3261. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER), the author of this re-
peal. 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my bill today to repeal the 
outdated and unnecessary 1957 Author-
ization for Use of Military Force. 
We have heard from many on just 
how this bill originally designed to de-
fend 
Middle 
East 
nations 
against 
‘‘armed aggression from any country 
controlled 
by 
international 
com-
munism,’’ how far it has outstripped 
its usefulness, no longer serving any 
purpose, but still retains that potential 
to be abused by any current or future 
administration to launch unwarranted 
military operations in the Middle East 
and doing an end run around Congress. 
The repeal we are discussing today 
would have no impact on ongoing oper-
ations, and is all the more reason to 
take it off the books immediately, but, 
Mr. Speaker, a decades-long war on ter-
ror and the lack of oversight, the lack 
of that reaffirming action on behalf of 
Congress has demonstrated to us the 
risks when we neglect our constitu-
tional duty to oversee matters of war 
and peace. It is time that Congress get 
back in the habit of vigorously debat-
ing and voting on these matters be-
cause the Constitution and the Amer-
ican people demand it. 
I applaud the work of my colleagues 
to help lead this bipartisan effort to re-
store Congress’ authority. Congress-
woman SPANBERGER’s bill to repeal the 
outdated 1991 AUMF is another critical 
step in this effort, and I am proud to 
support her on this matter. 
I also thank Congressman MIKE GAL-
LAGHER and Congressman JARED GOLD-
EN for helping to lead the effort to re-
peal the 1957 and 1991 AUMFs. And last-
ly, I thank Chairman MEEKS and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL
for helping to 
bring these bills to the House floor for 
a vote and for their leadership on 
reprising Congress’ authority in this 
area. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage on this 
bill. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, while the chairman was 
a toddler when this was enacted, I still 
was not born. I want to make that 
point. That is how old this thing is. 
And it is time. It is great to exercise 
our constitutional responsibilities and 
repeal these outdated AUMFs so that 
they can never be manipulated or ex-
ploited by a future President. 
Again, I view this as a historic mo-
ment that Congress and this com-
mittee are exercising its powers as the 
Founding Fathers had wanted us to. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of 
this, Mr. MEIJER, I thank the chairman 
for his leadership, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
I thank Mr. MEIJER for this piece of 
legislation. Again, I thank Mr. MCCAUL 
for working together, and I have no 
come back; yes, I was just a toddler, 
you weren’t here yet. 
There seems to be a theme, and if 
you think there is a theme that is 
going on today, there is a theme. The 
theme is that we in the United States 
Congress, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, are acting to reclaim our Con-
gressional war powers. First, we voted 
to repeal the 2002 AUMF, then the 1991 
AUMF, and now the 1957 AUMF. These 
authorizations serve no current na-
tional security purpose and only risk 
to strip Congress of its Article I au-
thority to decide matters of war and 
peace. That is the theme here today. 
The work is not over. We still have to 
work, as I have said, and I pledge to 
work with Mr. MCCAUL to repeal and 
replace the 2001 AUMF. But it is our 
solemn responsibility to decide when, 
where, and how we deploy members of 
our armed services and not take a back 
seat on such decisions to the executive 
branch.

Mr. Speaker, working together, we 
will indeed do what Article I tells us to 
do: To determine when, where, and how 
we go to war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this very important piece of 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3283, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

f 
CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE OF TREVOR REED 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 186) calling for the im-
mediate release of Trevor Reed, a 
United States citizen who was unjustly 
found guilty and sentenced to nine 
years in a Russian prison. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 186 
Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed 
is a resident of Granbury, Texas, and a 
United States Marine Corps veteran; 
Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow 
to visit his girlfriend in May 2019; 
Whereas Moscow’s Police Service detained 
Trevor Reed in August 2019; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grab-
bing the arm of the police officer driving the 
vehicle and elbowing another officer while en 
route to the police station, causing the vehi-
cle to swerve and therefore endangering the 
lives of the police officers; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed numerous diplomatic notes 
with the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding 
Trevor Reed being denied consular access, 
communications, medical treatment, family 
visitations, and other violations of the Vi-
enna Convention on Consular Relations; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given food or 
water until approximately 72 hours after his 
initial arrest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a med-
ical evaluation of his injuries until 10 days 
following his arrest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team pre-
sented video evidence to the courts that dis-
proves the police officers’ statements of sup-
posed endangerment and wrongdoing; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team was 
denied access to additional video evidence 
from inside the police vehicle and police sta-
tion that had the potential to prove his inno-
cence, the requests for all video recordings 
are documented, and the existence of the 
other videos was confirmed by police offi-
cials and investigators; 
Whereas the police officers claimed emo-
tional and physical damages, but did not sus-
tain any visible injury, or claim any time 
missed from work, and the law considers the 
police officers victims; 
Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation and the Second 
Court of Cassation of General Jurisdiction 
concurred that Russian procedural law was 
violated in the way that Trevor Reed’s bail 
was revoked; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed complaints with the Rus-
sian Foreign Ministry regarding denial of 
communications with Trevor Reed; 
Whereas during the trial, the defense coun-
sel presented 59 minutes of traffic camera 
video from four traffic cameras, and senior 
Russian Government officials analyzed the 
video recordings and confirmed that the vid-
eos showed the police car— 
(1) did not change direction or leave its 
lane; 
(2) did not swerve; and 
(3) did not stop or slow down; 
Whereas witnesses following directly be-
hind the police car in a private vehicle never 
witnessed any dangerous movement of the 
police car; 
Whereas the two police officers changed 
their testimonies in writing, in their inter-
views, and at least three times during de-
fense questioning, with final answers to the 
judge being ‘‘I don’t remember.’’, causing 
court attendees and the judge to laugh; 
Whereas the Investigative Bureau and 
Golovinsky District Court Judge Arnout de-
nied Trevor Reed’s requests to investigate 
how his injuries occurred; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky Dis-
trict Court Judge Arnout read a verdict that 
dismissed all defense evidence, witnesses, 
and government experts and only considered 
pieces of the police officers’ statements; 
Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed 
to 9 years in prison camp and was ordered to 
pay 100,000 rubles to each police officer for 
moral and physical injuries; 
Whereas Trevor Reed had already been de-
tained in Russia for one year at the time of 
the judge’s verdict; 
Whereas a Consul representing the United 
States Embassy in Moscow attended all of 
Trevor Reed’s trial hearings; 
Whereas the United States Ambassador to 
Russia, John Sullivan, upon Trevor’s sen-
tencing, stated that the prosecution’s case 
and the evidence presented against Mr. Reed 
were ‘‘so preposterous that they provoked 
laughter in the courtroom’’, the conviction 
and sentence were ‘‘ridiculous’’, and ‘‘justice 
was not even considered’’; 
Whereas, upon appeal to the Moscow City 
Court, the Golovinsky District Court failed 
to provide Trevor Reed with translated cop-
ies of the court’s decision and trial tran-
scripts per law; and 
Whereas the appeal court returned the case 
to the Golovinsky District Court to review 
omissions and incorrect statements in the 
trial transcripts, and the official court audio 
recordings were reviewed by the defense and 
the corrections were certified by a third- 
party notarization firm, with the result 
being Judge Arnout refusing to include any 
corrections to the corrupted transcripts: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to immediately release Trevor 
Reed and all other prisoners arrested for po-
litical motivations; 
(2) condemns the practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment in the Russian Fed-
eration, which violates the commitments of 
the Russian Federation to international obli-
gations with respect to human rights and the 
rule of law; 
(3) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise the case of 
Trevor Reed and to press for his release; 
(4) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul 
Whelan, and all prisoners unjustly impris-
oned in the Russian Federation; 
(5) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide unrestricted consular 
access to Trevor Reed while he remains in 
detention; 
(6) until Trevor Reed’s release, calls on the 
Government of the Russian Federation— 
(A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary 
medical treatment and personal protective 
equipment; 
(B) to notify the United States Ambas-
sador to Russia of any medical problems or 
complaints that arise during his detention; 
and 
(C) to provide the United States Embassy 
in Moscow with full access to all of Trevor 
Reed’s medical records; 
(7) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to respect Trevor Reed’s univer-
sally recognized human rights; and 
(8) expresses support to the family of 
Trevor Reed and commitment to bringing 
Trevor Reed home. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
186. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H. Res. 186, introduced by 
Mr. PFLUGER of Texas, calling for the 
release of Trevor Reed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bipartisan measure that we have now, 
regrettably, had to move through the 
committee and the House for two Con-
gresses. 
This is a good resolution that calls 
for the release of Trevor Reed and con-
demns the deplorable treatment in-
flicted upon him throughout his ordeal. 
It is shameful that the Kremlin con-
tinues to make a mockery of the prin-
ciples of an independent judiciary, the 
rule of law, and due process, holding in-
nocent American hostages for nefar-
ious political purposes. Not even the 
judge on Trevor Reed’s case could keep 
a straight face when presented with the 
absurd case that the Russian prosecu-
tors brought to the table, yet the 
courts sentenced him to 9 years in pris-
on anyway. 
On top of the unimaginable suffering 
Trevor has already endured as a result 
of his terrible conditions and refusal of 
the Russian authorities to attend to 
his medical needs, Mr. Reed has been 
now diagnosed with COVID–19.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3179 
June 28, 2021 
Other Americans are also suffering 
these same injustices inflicted by the 
Russian Government. 
Paul Whelan, first arrested on base-
less charges in December 2018, remains 
unjustly imprisoned and is serving a 16- 
year sentence. 
The imprisonment of American citi-
zens in Russia for political purposes, 
likely in an attempt to force the 
United States to release convicted Rus-
sian criminals and Putin cronies in the 
United States, is a despicable practice 
and an affront to human rights and the 
rule of law everywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that 
President Biden, in his meeting with 
Vladimir Putin in Geneva, specifically 
demanded the release of Trevor Reed 
and Paul Whelan; and I am pleased 
that we, in Congress, are continuing to 
do the same with the consideration of 
this resolution. 
The Kremlin must release Trevor 
Reed, Paul Whelan, and all others 
wrongfully detained in Russia so that 
they may finally return to their fami-
lies. This is an important bill resolu-
tion. I support it, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I thank the chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, 682 days ago, my con-
stituent, Trevor Reed of Granbury, 
Texas, was thrown into jail by the Rus-
sian Government for a crime he did not 
commit before being convicted in Rus-
sian kangaroo court. He is an Eagle 
Scout, a U.S. marine, and, more impor-
tantly, a beloved son and brother, who 
stands to endure a decade of his life in 
a Russian prison if we are unable to 
bring him home. 
Trevor was initially detained for pub-
lic intoxication, but when the Russian 
Federal Security Service discovered 
that he was a U.S. marine, they upped 
the charges and accused him of endan-
gering the lives of police officers. The 
accusation and the lack of evidence to 
support it was so ridiculous that even a 
Russian judge erupted in laughter dur-
ing his trial. 
U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan said 
justice was not even considered in this 
case, and described Trevor’s trial as a 
theater of the absurd. 
His trial was a sham, and his treat-
ment in the custody of Russian au-
thorities has been nothing short of ap-
palling. He has been denied medical 
care, counselor access, and has been re-
peatedly moved without prior or proper 
notification. Even when he was in-
fected with COVID, the Russians cut 
off communication with our embassy 
and with his family. Vladimir Putin 
himself 
recently 
smeared 
Trevor 
Reed’s name, further underscoring the 
reality that Trevor’s detainment is, in 
fact, politically motivated. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber MICHAEL
MCCAUL
for partnering 
with me to introduce this resolution, 
and for the support of Chairman 
MEEKS, and for our commitment to-
gether in a bipartisan way to stand up 
for Trevor and the entire Reed family 
and others who are unlawfully de-
tained. 
Mr. Speaker, the passage of this reso-
lution could not be more timely than it 
is today. In fact, just today, a corrupt 
Russian appeals court rejected Trevor’s 
final appeal certifying the absurd 9- 
year sentence. 
Our message is simple: The United 
States will not tolerate an American 
citizen being held by the Putin regime 
as a political pawn. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join together and stand firm 
with Trevor and his family, to reunite 
Trevor and his family, and to bring 
him home. Free Trevor Reed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL), a great patriot. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from west Texas for this 
important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, recently, I created the 
Congressional Task Force on American 
Hostages and Americans Wrongfully 
Detained Abroad with my colleague, 
our good friend, TED DEUTCH from Flor-
ida. I thank Representative PFLUGER 
for being one of the first Members to 
join that task force. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I come and 
rise in support of my friend, Represent-
ative PFLUGER’s resolution. This reso-
lution calls for the release of Trevor 
Reed of Texas; and expresses support 
for Paul Whelan of Michigan, another 
American unjustly imprisoned in Rus-
sia. 
From this debate, we have heard and 
learned some of the details of Trevor’s 
arrest, sham trial, and absurd sen-
tencing for his alleged crimes. All 
channels of the United States Govern-
ment must engage with friends and en-
emies alike to ensure that Americans 
in situations like Trevor and Paul are 
brought home expeditiously. 
This is especially the case for Mem-
bers of Congress who represent the con-
cerned families of those held hostage 
or wrongfully detained. Here in Con-
gress, we must continue to collaborate 
with the administration in situations 
like these to disincentivize wrongful 
detention and taking hostage of Ameri-
cans in the future. 
Let this be a message to Trevor and 
Paul and their families: We are com-
mitted to bringing you back to the 
United States safely. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of 
the full committee for his support of 
this effort and work. I also thank my 
friend from west Texas. I urge all my 
colleagues to support this resolution. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the 
chairman 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
MCCAUL. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States must 
send a strong message to Vladimir 
Putin that we will not tolerate a U.S. 
citizen and a marine veteran being held 
as a political pawn. 
I, again, want to recognize those here 
in the Chamber who have supported 
this. 
Ranking 
Member 
MICHAEL 
MCCAUL from Texas, Mr. HILL from Ar-
kansas, and others for partnering with 
me on the resolution, that we will not 
stand for any unlawful detention of 
any American. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the American families 
of those wrongfully detained by Russia 
are waiting for decisive action. Con-
gress needs to stand united in support 
of Trevor Reed, Paul Whelan, and all 
those who have had to suffer terrible 
conditions and treatment by the Krem-
lin. 
This resolution introduced by Mr. 
PFLUGER makes clear our resolute con-
demnation of their imprisonment, de-
manding the release of the American 
prisoners who are being used as pawns 
in the Kremlin’s political game. It is 
past time for Russia to release these 
political prisoners and return them to 
their families. 
Again, I thank Mr. PFLUGER for in-
troducing this legislation, and I thank 
Ranking Member MCCAUL for working 
with us. I urge my colleagues to vote in 
support of this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3180 
June 28, 2021 
H.R. 2471 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Haiti Devel-
opment, Accountability, and Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earth-
quake struck near the Haitian capital city of 
Port-au-Prince, leaving at least 220,000 peo-
ple dead, including 103 United States citi-
zens, 101 United Nations personnel, and near-
ly 18 percent of Haiti’s civil service, as well 
as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, 
and 1,500,000 Haitians displaced. 
(2) The international community, led by 
the United States and the United Nations, 
mounted an unprecedented humanitarian re-
sponse to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 
2018, more than 8,000,000,000 has been dis-
bursed by donors. Since the 2010 earthquake, 
the United States Government has disbursed 
more than 4,000,000,000 in recovery and devel-
opment funding. 
(3) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
struck southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon 
Peninsula, causing widespread damage and 
flooding and leaving 1.4 million people in 
need of immediate assistance. Recovery ef-
forts continue more than four years later. 
(4) Prior to both the 2010 earthquake and 
2016 hurricane, Haiti registered among the 
lowest in socioeconomic indicators and had 
the second highest rate of income disparity 
in the world—conditions that have further 
complicated disaster recovery and resilience 
efforts. As of November 2020, 4,400,000 people 
were in need of humanitarian assistance in 
Haiti. 
(5) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians 
have participated in popular demonstrations 
demanding accountability over government 
manage-merit of Petrocaribe resources. In 
early 2019, the Haitian superior court of 
auditors released a series of reports impli-
cating high-level government officials in the 
misappropriation of funds. 
(6) The United Nations Human Rights Of-
fice of the High Commissioner and the 
Human Rights Service jointly found a 333 
percent increase in human rights violations 
and abuses against the rights of life and se-
curity in Haiti from July 2018 through De-
cember 2019. There were 131 violations in 2018 
and 567 violations in 2019, including the 
shooting of at least five Haitian journalists 
covering the protests. 
(7) Leading members of civil society have 
faced attacks, including Monferrier Dorval, a 
constitutional law expert and president of 
the Port-au-Prince bar who was killed on 
August 28, 2020. 
(8) On November 13, 2018, according to the 
Haitian National Human Rights Defense Net-
work, at least 71 people were killed and 18 
people were raped in the Port-au-Prince 
neighborhood of La Saline. 
(9) On December 10, 2020, the Department 
of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control designated former Haitian National 
Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former Di-
rector General of the Ministry of the Interior 
Fednel Monchery, and former Departmental 
Delegate Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan pur-
suant to the Global Magnitsky Executive 
Order for being foreign persons responsible 
for or complicit in, or having directly or in-
directly engaged in, serious human rights 
abuse for their connection to the La Saline 
massacre. 
(10) Following the La Saline massacre, 
similar attacks have occurred in Port-au- 
Prince neighborhoods, including the Novem-
ber 2019 and August 2020 attacks on Bel Air, 
in which 24 people were killed and hundreds 
of families were displaced. 
(11) Parliamentary elections scheduled for 
October 2019 did not take place, and since 
January 13, 2020, President Jovenel Moı¨se 
has ruled by decree. The United States and 
international community have urged Presi-
dent Moı¨se to limit the use of executive de-
crees during this period and have ex-pressed 
concern over several decrees issued, includ-
ing those creating the National Intelligence 
Agency and appointing three new judges to 
the Supreme Court outside of constitutional 
procedures. Haitian civil society organiza-
tions have denounced the president’s use of 
decrees as an attempt to consolidate power. 
(12) Due to institutional weakness and 
other challenges exacerbated by the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Haiti’s economy contracted by 
an estimated 4 percent in 2020 and inflation 
neared 20 percent. Although there has been 
no parliament in place since January 2020, 
the Haitian Government approved a budget 
on September 30, 2020. However, the delay 
prevented the International Monetary Fund 
and other multilaterals from disbursing mil-
lions in international assistance. 
(13) In September 2020, President Moı¨se by-
passed the Supreme Court to appoint a Pro-
visional Electoral Council (CEP) by execu-
tive decree Several civil society groups that 
traditionally participate in Haiti’s electoral 
councils criticized the decision and have de-
clined to be represented in the CEP. 
(14) The Moı¨se administration lacks the 
credibility to oversee a proposed constitu-
tional referendum scheduled for June 2021, 
which legal experts consider unconstitu-
tional. 
(15) There are concerns that, given the lack 
of democratic checks and balances, the dis-
pute over the credibility of the electoral 
council, and the deteriorating security situa-
tion, elections scheduled for September 2021 
will not be free or fair. Additionally, the se-
curity situation remains volatile and on Feb-
ruary 7, 2021, President Moı¨se alleged that a 
coup had been attempted against him lead-
ing to 23 arrests and the forced retirement of 
three Supreme Court judges.

the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2471, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2471, the Haiti Development, 
Accountability, 
and 
Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act. 
I thank my friend, Mr. JEFFRIES, for 
authoring this bipartisan bill. Mr. 
JEFFRIES has been a strong advocate 
for the Haitian people, and I thank him 
for his friendship and leadership on 
this very important issue. 
On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 
earthquake struck Haiti with an epi-
center just a few miles west of Port-au- 
Prince. This devastating natural dis-
aster killed more than 200,000 people, 
displaced 1.5 million Haitians, and 
caused billions of dollars in damages. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with 
the same message my colleagues and I 
delivered to the Haitian people 11 years 
ago: The United States remains stead-
fast in our commitment to help Haiti 
however we can. 
Over the last decade, Congress has 
worked closely with the Haitian-Amer-
ican diaspora, the Haitian people, the 
Haitian Government to support re-
building and development efforts on 
the island. 
Unfortunately, after Hurricane Mat-
thew devastated Haiti in 2016, the 
country faced another humanitarian 
crisis, and additional rebuilding and 
development plans were needed. 
b 1615 
Sadly, Haiti still has a long way to 
go. The Haiti Development, Account-
ability, and Institutional Transparency 
Initiative Act evaluates the effective-
ness of U.S. recovery and development 
efforts in Haiti over the past 10 years 
and devises strategies to promote the 
rule of law, encourage freedom of the 
press, combat government corruption, 
address the root causes of poverty, and 
improve development efforts. 
Helping to pave the pathway to a re-
constructed, 
prosperous 
Haiti, 
of 
course, is a two-way street. We must 
learn from our mistakes over the past 
10 years and devise innovative solu-
tions for any roadblocks that lie ahead. 
At the same time, it is imperative 
that the Haitian Government address 
the growing and legitimate concerns 
about 
the 
country’s 
deteriorating 
human rights situation, spiraling gang 
violence, and often-seen impunity for 
corrupt officials.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3182 
June 28, 2021 
It is the duty of all of us here in Con-
gress to stand with the Haitian people 
as they demand a safe, prosperous, and 
democratic Haiti. I urge the Haitian 
Government to do all they can to en-
gage with their citizens and truly lis-
ten to their concerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
passed 
this 
bipartisan 
bill 
unani-
mously, and I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting its passage on 
the House floor today. 
Again, I thank my real friend, Mr. 
JEFFRIES, for being such a great cham-
pion for Haiti. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Haiti con-
tinue to suffer from devastating nat-
ural disasters, political instability, and 
fragile public institutions. The country 
has never recovered from the 2010 
earthquake or the damage caused by 
Hurricane Matthew in 2016. 
With their economy unable to re-
cover, Haiti remains the poorest coun-
try in the Western Hemisphere. As a 
result, the lack of economic oppor-
tunity has led to an increase in crime 
and gang violence. At the same time, 
civil unrest caused by political insta-
bility plagues the island nation. 
There are credible accusations of sys-
temic 
government 
corruption 
and 
human rights abuses, and Haiti is fac-
ing a constitutional crisis after failing 
to organize legislative elections in 2019; 
meaning, the country has no sitting 
Parliament at this time. 
We continue to strongly urge the 
Government of Haiti to hold free and 
fair elections that reflect the will of 
the Haitian people. 
All of these challenges are now com-
pounded by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
That is why I support the Haiti Devel-
opment, Accountability, and Institu-
tional Transparency Initiative Act. 
This legislation requires the State De-
partment to assess how effective U.S. 
assistance is in helping Haiti’s recov-
ery efforts. 
Haiti remains the second largest re-
cipient of U.S. support in the region. 
Since 2011, American taxpayers have 
sent nearly $1.9 billion to assist them 
with economic development and to sup-
port expanding their democracy. It is 
our responsibility in this Congress to 
ensure that this money is, in fact, 
being spent wisely. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JACOBS), a valued member 
of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 2471, the Haiti Develop-
ment, 
Accountability, 
and 
Institu-
tional Transparency Initiative Act. I 
thank Congressman JEFFRIES for his 
leadership in offering this important 
piece of legislation that will ensure 
that we take stock of U.S. policy in 
Haiti and measure our progress in ad-
dressing corruption, improving govern-
ance, and advancing the rule of law. 
Haiti is facing one of its worst out-
breaks of violence since 1986. This has 
had a devastating impact on the Hai-
tian people and threatened any long- 
term progress we have made. We have 
seen this movie before. Instead of con-
tinuing the same approach and hoping 
for a different outcome, it is critical 
that as we are conducting our long- 
overdue review of policy, we are ana-
lyzing the drivers and risks of conflict, 
instability, and violence in Haiti. 
This bill sets out to do just that and 
more. The amendment I offered in com-
mittee requires the State Department 
and USAID to conduct an assessment 
of conflict, instability, and violence in 
Haiti, analyzing the systemic patterns 
and causes of violence and the role of 
actors and beneficiaries who play a 
part. 
This bill also makes sure that State 
and USAID are consulting with NGOs 
and civil society groups in Haiti, a crit-
ical step that is often overlooked. 
As someone who has worked in con-
flict stabilization at the State Depart-
ment, I know how important it is that 
we understand the root causes of vio-
lence in order to craft sound policy and 
make decisions on where to focus our 
foreign assistance. This bill would en-
sure our review of U.S. policy in Haiti 
takes this important step. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is true that Haiti 
continues to face significant chal-
lenges. Yet, I remain optimistic that 
we can partner with the Haitian people 
and play a constructive role in the 
coming critical years of Haiti’s recov-
ery. And while we must continue our 
unwavering support for Haiti, we also 
must be open to making adjustments 
moving forward. 
By increasing cooperation and being 
open to new ideas, I am confident that 
we can support the Haitian people as 
they seek peace, stability, an end to 
poverty, and a fully functioning democ-
racy. 
We know this is not going to be easy, 
but we have to stand by the Haitian 
people and make sure that they have 
an opportunity to have a better tomor-
row, for surely, they deserve it. 
Mr. Speaker, let me finally thank, 
again, Representative JEFFRIES for au-
thoring this piece of legislation. It is 
very important, and I know that he has 
a large portion of the Haitian diaspora 
in his district, as it is in New York in 
mine and Representative CLARKE’s and, 
of course, in Florida. 
We will stand by the Haitian people, 
not giving up hope, not giving up trust, 
imploring the Government of Haiti to 
do the right thing for the people of 
Haiti by having elections that are free 
and fair. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
voice my support for H.R. 2471, the ‘‘Haiti De-
velopment, Accountability, and Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act,’’ which modernizes 
the U.S. foreign assistance strategy to Haiti, 
and affirms our role as a champion of democ-
racy and good neighbor in the Western Hemi-
sphere. 
This legislation, introduced by my colleague, 
the gentleman from New York, Congressman 
HAKEEM
JEFFRIES, 
would 
promote 
trans-
parency within Haitian humanitarian assist-
ance programs, and place democratic values 
such as good governance, freedom of the 
press, and human rights at the forefront of our 
bilateral relationship with Haiti. 
Since the catastrophic earthquake on Janu-
ary 12, 2010, which left 220,000 people dead, 
300,000 injured, and 115,000 homes de-
stroyed, the United States—in partnership with 
the international community—mounted an un-
precedented humanitarian response. 
The United States Government has dis-
bursed more than $4,000,000,000 in recovery 
and development funding since the disaster 
struck in 2010. 
In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused wide-
spread damage and flooding, leaving 1.4 mil-
lion people in need of immediate assistance. 
Prior to these catastrophes, Haiti registered 
among the lowest in socioeconomic indicators 
and had the second highest rate of income 
disparity in the world. 
Concurrently, democratic backsliding in Haiti 
undercuts the shared commitment to democ-
racy in our bilateral relationship and stymies 
our effort to ensure that humanitarian aid is 
reaching and improving the welfare of the Hai-
tian people. 
The United Nations Human Rights Office of 
the High Commissioner and the Human Rights 
Service jointly found a 333 percent increase in 
human rights violations and abuses from July 
2018 through December 2019. 
On top of that, parliamentary elections 
scheduled for October 2019 never took place, 
and since January 2020, President Jovenel 
Moı¨se has ruled by decree. 
As an original co-sponsor of H.R. 3059, the 
‘‘Assessing Progress in Haiti, Act of 2013,’’ I 
maintain an unshaking belief in the Haitian 
people’s resilience, entrepreneurial spirit, and 
desire for a free and fair political system. 
That is why I also staunchly opposed the 
former president’s attempt to terminate Tem-
porary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians liv-
ing in the United States. 
In tandem with the U.S. Government, Haiti 
relies on remittances that its citizens receive 
from TPS beneficiaries in the United States. 
The Haitian community in Texas exemplifies 
this reality. 
As such, I am pleased that Secretary 
Mayorkas announced a new 18-month des-
ignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Sta-
tus. 
Following Hurricane Matthew, I called upon 
Houstonians to do their part in alleviating the 
suffering of our neighbors in Haiti. 
In partnership with local organizations, 
churches, and the diaspora community, we 
collected and donated clothing, pillows, non-
perishable foods, and other items to help the 
Haitian people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3183 
June 28, 2021 
Now, I call upon this Congress to answer 
the call of help—to act in accordance with our 
long-standing record of supporting the Haitian 
people in recovering and building a future wor-
thy of their aspirations. 
The ‘‘Haiti Development, Accountability, and 
Institutional Transparency Initiative Act’’ is our 
response to this call for help. 
H.R. 2471—a bicameral and bipartisan ef-
fort—urgently upgrades our U.S. foreign as-
sistance strategy and strengthens human 
rights, promotes freedom of the press, and 
supports disaster resilience and reconstruction 
efforts in Haiti. 
I commend my colleagues, particularly the 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
HAKEEM JEFFRIES, for shining a light on this 
issue, and remaining firm in our commitment 
to the Haitian people. 
Let us, with one voice, irrespective of party, 
come together and affirm our role as a bul-
wark of democracy in the world and good 
neighbor in the hemisphere. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
this long overdue but enormously beneficial 
legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2471, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GLOBAL LEARNING LOSS 
ASSESSMENT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1500) to direct the Administrator 
of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development to submit to 
Congress a report on the impact of the 
COVID–19 pandemic on global basic 
education programs, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1500 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global 
Learning Loss Assessment Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pan-
demic began, 258,000,000 children were out of 
school globally, including 130,000,000 girls. 
(2) Students already at a disadvantage be-
fore COVID–19 will experience greater learn-
ing loss, thereby worsening inequity and in-
equality. 
(3) Approximately 90 percent of the world’s 
student population—over 1,600,000,000 chil-
dren and youth—have had their education 
disrupted by school closure due to COVID–19. 
(4) School closures lead to interrupted 
learning, poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, 
increased dropout rates, exposure to vio-
lence, and social isolation. 
(5) Up to 24,000,000 children are at risk of 
dropping out of school permanently due to 
rising levels of child poverty associated with 
the pandemic. 
(6) School closure and remote learning is 
especially burdensome on girls, who are fre-
quently expected to shoulder more household 
chores and responsibilities and are more vul-
nerable to gender-based violence. 
(7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide 
school closures in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to 
increased instances of sexual- and gender- 
based violence, teenage pregnancy, school 
dropout, and child labor for girls. 
(8) More than 60 percent of national dis-
tance learning alternatives rely exclusively 
on online platforms but two-thirds of the 
world’s school aged children, or 1,300,000,000 
children aged 3 through 17, do not have inter-
net connection in their homes, and schools 
and local learning centers also frequently 
have 
inadequate 
internet 
connectivity. 
Eighty percent of students in sub-Saharan 
Africa lack such access, with an even higher 
rate for girls. 
(9) Children and youth with disabilities are 
particularly vulnerable to the health, edu-
cation, and socioeconomic consequences of 
the pandemic. As a further challenge, dis-
tance learning tools are not always acces-
sible to learners with disabilities or those 
with complex learning needs, especially in 
poorer and rural households. 
(10) Before the COVID–19 pandemic, refugee 
children were twice as likely to be out of 
school as other youth, and school closures 
and a lack of access to distance learning 
tools threaten to make the education gap 
among refugee children even more severe. 
(11) The economic downturn caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic could lead to an edu-
cation financing gap of $77,000,000,000 in low- 
and middle-income countries over the next 2 
years. 
(12) The economic cost of school closures 
could be up to $1,337 per student, which on a 
global 
scale 
equates 
to 
approximately 
$10,000,000,000,000 in lost economic output 
over the coming generation. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States that 
United States-funded basic education pro-
grams operating in low- and middle-income 
countries should seek to— 
(1) provide inclusive learning opportunities 
for students and teachers, especially for the 
most marginalized, including girls, children 
with disabilities, and previously out of 
school children; 
(2) build local capacity and help countries 
strengthen their education systems, includ-
ing opportunities for early childhood devel-
opment; 
(3) improve the availability, delivery, and 
quality of education services from early 
childhood through secondary education; 
(4) improve equity and safety in education 
services; and 
(5) support the return of children to school 
who have experienced interruptions in their 
education due to the COVID–19 pandemic and 
work to enroll previously out-of-school chil-
dren and youth, particularly the most 
marginalized. 
SEC. 4. REPORT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development, act-
ing through the Senior Coordinator for 
International Basic Education Assistance 
and in consultation with the Senior Coordi-
nator for Gender Equality and Women’s Em-
powerment, shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report on the 
impact of the COVID–19 pandemic on United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment basic education programs. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The report 
required under subsection (a) shall include, 
at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1) An assessment of the impact of COVID– 
19 on such basic education programs, includ-
ing the magnitude of learning loss that will 
result from protracted school closures and 
the specific effects of school and learning 
space closures on marginalized children and 
youth, including girls, minority populations, 
displaced children, and those with disabil-
ities. 
(2) An assessment comparing academic 
outcomes of beneficiaries of United States 
Agency for International Development basic 
education programs, as practical and appro-
priate, between those that attend schools 
that remain closed or continue to operate re-
motely since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic and schools that have resumed in-per-
son instruction. 
(3) A description of the effectiveness, cost, 
accessibility, and reach of the most com-
monly used forms of distance learning in 
low- and middle-income countries and low- 
resource contexts. 
(4) A description of efforts to pivot and 
adapt such basic education programs during 
the COVID–19 pandemic, including an over-
view of existing data on funding and pro-
grammatic focus disaggregated by gender, 
country, education level, and disability. 
(5) An identification and description of any 
gaps in, or barriers to, reaching and edu-
cating marginalized populations, such as 
girls, children with disabilities, displaced 
children, or other children adversely affected 
by the COVID–19 pandemic with distance 
learning interventions. 
(6) A description of the United States 
Agency for International Development’s plan 
and needed authorities and resources to pre-
vent degradation of such basic education

ments of student learning levels, remedial 
and accelerated learning, re-enrollment cam-
paigns for out-of-school children and youth, 
and education system strengthening and re-
silience-building efforts. 
(7) An analysis of the coordination between 
the United States Agency for International 
Development and other actors in global basic 
education policy and programming to pro-
vide education during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, including partner organizations, faith 
based-organizations, donors, and multilat-
eral organizations. 
(8) A description of opportunities to part-
ner and support efforts to expand access to 
digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, 
and learning resources in areas that lack ac-
cess to digital and remote learning infra-
structure and resources, including rural and 
remote communities. 
(c) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.—The report re-
quired by subsection (a) shall be made avail-
able to the public. 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3184 
June 28, 2021 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1500, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1500, the Global Learning Loss 
Assessment Act of 2021. 
I thank Representative HOULAHAN for 
authoring this bipartisan bill and for 
her leadership and strong advocacy for 
children and education around the 
world. 
Over the past year and a half, we 
have seen everyday lives disrupted in 
unimaginable ways due to COVID–19. 
One of the biggest disruptions has been 
in the realm of education. From pri-
mary school to graduate school, stu-
dents around the world have seen their 
education 
interrupted, 
challenged, 
adapted, and forever changed by this 
pandemic. 
The United States has long supported 
basic education efforts around the 
world, with its most recent champion, 
former Congresswoman NITA
LOWEY, 
being an invaluable advocate. It is 
therefore 
crucial 
that 
the 
United 
States 
understand 
the 
effects 
of 
COVID–19 on international basic edu-
cation programs and use that data to 
respond to current crises and better 
prepare for future pandemics. 
Research has already shown that 
every day and every year in school 
counts. Women earn up to 12 percent 
more for every additional year they 
stay in school. However, UNESCO esti-
mates that as many as 11 million—I re-
peat, 11 million—girls won’t return to 
school after COVID, which increased 
their risk of forced labor, early mar-
riage, and limiting their professional 
and economic opportunities. 
This bill requires the United States 
Agency for International Development 
to submit a report to Congress on the 
impacts of COVID–19 on USAID’s basic 
education programs and global learn-
ing loss, including the magnitude of 
global learning loss that will result 
from protracted school closures, de-
scriptions of forms of distance learning 
in low resource contexts, analysis of 
how 
school 
closures 
affected 
marginalized children, data on Agency 
programs being carried out to support 
continued learning during the pan-
demic, and a description of what is 
needed to help mitigate learning loss 
and help students get back on the right 
track. 
Again, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
HOULAHAN for her work on this bill and 
her commitment to ensuring that we 
are fully aware of how COVID–19 has 
placed development gains at risk and 
to finding the best path forward to pre-
vent further backsliding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Representatives 
HOULAHAN
and 
FITZPATRICK, for their work on the 
Global Learning Loss Assessment Act. 
As of December 2020, the United Na-
tions estimated that school classrooms 
for one in five children, which is over 
320 million children, remained closed. 
Further reports indicate more than 880 
million children worldwide faced dis-
ruptions to their education due to full 
and partial school closures. 
The continued closure of schools and 
classrooms is having a devastating im-
pact on the education and the develop-
ment of the next generation. This bill 
requires a report on COVID–19 impacts 
on the United States to support edu-
cation programs in developing coun-
tries. 
Last year, the United States provided 
over $900 million to support basic edu-
cation programs, including support for 
teacher training, curriculum develop-
ment, and expanding access to edu-
cation for refugees and communities in 
conflict zones. 
b 1630 
In many countries, including here in 
the United States, schools were forced 
to pivot to virtual learning or close en-
tirely. This bill does not provide any 
additional assistance. Instead, it re-
quires USAID to assess how previously 
appropriated funds have been impacted 
by school closures and other COVID–19- 
related issues. 
It also requires an assessment of how 
the administration and our imple-
menting partners are changing pro-
grams to avoid backsliding in edu-
cation outcomes as COVID–19 con-
tinues to prevent regular schooling. 
It is critical that we understand the 
impacts of COVID–19 on our programs 
to ensure our foreign aid is used effi-
ciently and effectively. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN), a valued 
member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Chairman MEEKS and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL for their leader-
ship on this critical issue and for work-
ing with me on this bill to get it not 
only passed out of committee, but here 
on the floor for consideration on a sus-
pension basis. 
I have had a really eclectic back-
ground before joining Congress, but 
most recently, I was a high school 
chemistry teacher in north Philadel-
phia, and I also ran a nonprofit focused 
on early childhood literacy for pre-K 
through fourth-grade kids. So I am par-
ticularly passionate about the issue 
that we are talking about today. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to rise 
today to ask my colleagues for their 
support of H.R. 1500, the Global Learn-
ing Loss Assessment Act. 
My bill will direct the U.S. Agency 
for International Development to sub-
mit a report to Congress on the im-
pacts of COVID–19 on the Agency’s 
basic education programs and global 
learning. 
Investing in global education is not a 
humanitarian issue. It is an economic 
and national security issue. A more 
educated global population paves the 
way for a more stable global economy, 
and what is clear is that COVID–19 has 
caused a dramatic loss in global learn-
ing. 
Our first step must be to clearly 
identify the scope of this loss so that 
we can begin the work of bridging that 
gap. The estimates are alarming. Nine-
ty 
percent 
of 
students 
worldwide, 
meaning 1.6 billion youth, have had se-
vere interruptions in their education 
due to COVID–19. This gap has the po-
tential to hinder global efforts on eco-
nomic justice, lasting peace, poverty 
eradication, ending world hunger, gen-
der equity, and so much more. 
As a steadfast advocate for women 
and girls around the world, I am also 
particularly 
concerned 
about 
the 
harrowing consequences that school- 
aged girls face in light of school clo-
sures, including an increased likeli-
hood of gender-based violence. 
To shore up the increasing gaps in 
learning and to preserve massive gains 
the United States has made in global 
education rates, we have to understand 
the extent of damage this pandemic 
has caused. This bill will arm us with 
the data that we need to move quickly, 
invest effectively across our USAID 
programs, and make our international 
basic education programs more resil-
ient to crises such as these. 
We cannot afford to ignore the dev-
astating effects that COVID–19 has had 
on students around our globe. Edu-
cation loss will continue without in-
tentional steps on our behalf, and so 
that is why I am so grateful to Speaker 
PELOSI, Chairman MEEKS, and Mr. 
MCCAUL
for placing my bipartisan 
Global Learning Loss Assessment Act 
here before the Congress for a vote 
today. 
In particular, I want to thank and ex-
press my deep appreciation to Rep-
resentative 
FITZPATRICK
and 
Rep-
resentative QUIGLEY
for working so 
closely with my office in introducing 
this legislation with me. 
Their steadfast education to learning 
and students around the world is to be 
commended. This is an important bill, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to join 
me in this crucial effort to mitigate 
the drastic effects of such an edu-
cational gap and the effects it is al-
ready having.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3185 
June 28, 2021 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. HOULAHAN 
for this important legislation that she 
is introducing. Education lays the 
foundation for future prosperity and 
stability. I am deeply concerned by the 
impact this pandemic is having on 
school children, particularly amongst 
the 
vulnerable 
communities 
facing 
conflict and refugees who are already 
experiencing barriers to educational 
access. 
We must understand the full scope of 
these challenges in order to address 
programs accordingly and ensure effec-
tive use of our funds. So I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Education is recognized as the surest 
path to economic mobility. However, 
over the past year and a half, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has rattled edu-
cational systems across the world, pre-
sented challenges unlike anything we 
have seen in the last 100 years since we 
had the last global pandemic, and it 
jeopardizes access to education for stu-
dents around the world. 
While some students and educators 
quickly adapted and overcame these 
challenges, the widespread disruptions 
caused by the pandemic will invariably 
have lasting impacts on communities 
at home and abroad. The Global Learn-
ing Loss Assessment Act of 2021 will 
allow us to better understand the effect 
the pandemic has had on global learn-
ing, and also find ways to help get stu-
dents back on the path to continued 
learning and future success. 
I know from my home city that the 
lack of availability of educational 
school buildings and lack of dialogue 
and conversations with other students 
in the classroom has hurt them. We 
need to evaluate and make sure what 
needs to be done so they can make up 
that time and continue the path to suc-
cess because our Nation here in the 
United States and in the countries 
around the world are dependent upon it 
so that we can have a better tomorrow. 
That is why I thank Ms. HOULAHAN 
for 
her 
bill, 
along 
with 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK, working with the minor-
ity, Ranking Member MCCAUL, coming 
together because we understand the 
significance and importance of edu-
cation. I hope all of my colleagues will 
join in supporting this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1500, as

URGING THE ADMINISTRATION TO 
FACILITATE ASSISTANCE IN RE-
SPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING 
IMPACT OF COVID–19 IN INDIA 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the resolu-
tion (H. Res. 402) urging the Adminis-
tration to facilitate assistance in re-
sponse to the devastating impact of 
COVID–19 in India, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 402 
Whereas in March 2021, a second wave of 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred 
to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) infectious began to surge 
in India, overwhelming health care workers, 
hospitals, and crematoriums throughout the 
country; 
Whereas testing results indicate India is 
seeing more than 340,000 new daily infections 
and upward of 4,000 deaths a day, though 
public health experts believe case rates are 
higher; 
Whereas cases have surged in neighboring 
countries such as Nepal and other countries 
in the area remain highly vulnerable to re-
newed spikes in cases; 
Whereas the deadly COVID–19 outbreak in 
India is a global problem that requires a co-
ordinated global response; 
Whereas in the spring of 2020, when the 
United States was in the midst of a dev-
astating spike in COVID–19 cases, India lift-
ed its export ban on certain therapeutics in 
response to a request by the United States 
Government; 
Whereas India’s pharmaceutical industry is 
a vital part of the global solution to the pan-
demic, especially for much of Asia, Africa, 
and Latin America, and is the world’s big-
gest producer of COVID vaccines having ex-
ported 66.36 million doses to 93 countries, in-
cluding to United Nations personnel and, ac-
counting for over half of global vaccine man-
ufacturing; 
Whereas due to India’s critical importance 
in global vaccine supply chains, an increase 
in domestic vaccine demand as a result of 
the surge of COVID–19 cases within India is 
of global concern; 
Whereas in response to the crisis in India, 
the Biden administration took quick action 
to deliver urgently needed supplies to India, 
including oxygen support, oxygen concentra-
tors, personal protective equipment (PPE), 
raw materials for vaccine, rapid diagnostic 
tests, and therapeutics, and is a testament 
to the historic record of United States-India 
health cooperation dating more than seven 
decades; 
Whereas the United States private sector 
has worked to generously support relief ef-
forts in India including by working to deliver 
1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen concentra-
tors to health care facilities across India; 
Whereas many countries around the world 
have also sent medical assistance to India to 
help the country defeat this devastating 
wave of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas as the United States vaccine sup-
ply for the American people is secured, it is 
important for the United States to continue 
to ramp up its efforts, working with the pri-
vate sector and all possible partners, to ex-
pand vaccine manufacturing and distribution 
worldwide; and 
Whereas United States support for India to 
help beat back this latest coronavirus wave 
is in the United States national interest as 
the pandemic will not end anywhere until it 
ends everywhere: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) urges the Administration to facilitate 
private, in-kind medical supply donations to 
India and deliver additional, urgently needed 
medical supplies, including oxygen generator 
plants and a cryogenic oxygen tanker and 
containers; 
(2) urges the Administration to facilitate 
assistance as needed to neighboring coun-
tries, including Nepal, that are facing the 
spread of COVID–19 and working with part-
ners around the world to address the virus; 
and 
(3) calls on the United States private sec-
tor and the Indian-American community to 
continue their unprecedented and generous 
efforts at procuring medical supplies for the 
Indian response during this time of need, 
building upon contributions to date, stand-
ing with the people of India as they collec-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM) each

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
402, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 402, urging the administra-
tion to facilitate assistance in response 
to the devastating impact of COVID–19 
in India. 
This resolution, introduced by my 
good friend Representative SHERMAN, is 
an excellent measure that solidifies 
this body’s already strong, bipartisan 
support for the people of India as they 
recover from this most recent wave of 
COVID–19 infections. 
It urges the administration to con-
tinue facilitating much-needed assist-
ance. We are all saddened by the dev-
astating impact COVID–19 has had on 
the Indian people. Beginning in March 
2021, India started to experience a 
surge of COVID–19 cases and deaths. In-
dians from all backgrounds, young and 
old, urban and rural have been touched 
by this pandemic. 
With infections rising at an alarming 
rate, the healthcare system struggled 
to provide care to all of those infected, 
and medical supply shortages were re-
ported across the country. 
Harrowing images depicted the dev-
astation that COVID–19 caused, from 
family members looking for hospital 
beds and medical supplies, to funeral 
pyres burning nonstop, 24 hours a day, 
to ensure the last rites of the many 
people who have passed. 
I am pleased with the Biden adminis-
tration’s swift response, sending much-

needed medical supplies to India. It 
was not just the American Government 
that contributed. We witnessed many 
in the Indian-American community 
and the United States private sector 
rally support to get critical supplies to 
India. 
We now see COVID–19 cases starting 
to come down, but we cannot let our 
guard down. We must do more to pre-
pare for a potential new wave of infec-
tions. It is important to recognize that 
none of us will be safe until all of us 
are safe. 
The pandemic continues to highlight 
the important role of India in com-
bating this disease globally. Its role in 
the global medical manufacturing sup-
ply chain is critical to defeating this 
pandemic. The global community relies 
on Indian pharmaceutical and vaccine 
manufacturing capability. What hap-
pens in India also has spillover effects 
in neighboring countries like Nepal. 
Again, I thank the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN) for putting 
forth this resolution, and I ask my col-
leagues to vote in favor of it and stand 
in solidarity with the people of India. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank 
my colleagues Congressman SHERMAN 
and Congressman CHABOT
for intro-
ducing this legislation. 
COVID–19 has had a devastating im-
pact on the world, but some countries 
have been hit harder than others. 
In March of this year, just as Ameri-
cans were receiving COVID–19 vaccines 
and the United States was seeing a de-
cline in cases, infections in India began 
to surge. A year before, in the spring of 
2020, when the United States was expe-
riencing a spike in COVID–19 cases, 
India came to our aid and lifted its ex-
port ban on certain drugs in response 
to a request by the United States. 
In response to India’s surge, the 
United States quickly delivered much- 
needed supplies, such as PPE, rapid 
tests, and other drugs to India. This ac-
tion from the United States, the 
world’s oldest democracy, to India, the 
world’s largest democracy, is only fit-
ting. India and the United States are 
natural partners and COVID–19 has 
only proven our ties are growing 
stronger. 
This resolution further shows that 
the House stands with the people of 
India as they work to stem the spread 
of COVID–19 throughout India. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. SHERMAN), a very 
valued member of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, my good friend. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding. I want to 
thank my colleague and co-chair of the 
House Congressional Caucus on India 
and Indian-Americans, Mr. CHABOT, for 
joining with me in introducing this res-
olution. 
Mr. CHABOT and I introduced this res-
olution recognizing the devastating im-
pact that COVID–19 has had on India 
and expressing the sense of the House 
of Representatives about the need to 
provide the maximum possible assist-
ance to India. 
The House has a long, bipartisan 
record of supporting and strengthening 
the relationship between the United 
States, the world’s oldest democracy, 
and India, the world’s largest democ-
racy. 
I also want to thank Chairman 
MEEKS and Ranking Member MCCAUL 
for working with us on this important 
resolution, and thank my colleagues on 
the Foreign Affairs Committee for 
passing this resolution unanimously. 
The COVID–19 outbreak in India re-
quires a global response. We know that 
the COVID epidemic is not limited by 
international borders, and the pan-
demic will not end anywhere until it 
ends everywhere, as the chairman 
pointed out. 
This is particularly true with regard 
to variants and we are aware of the 
delta variant that is now spreading. 
b 1645 
Until we can vaccinate the world, 
there will be millions, billions of op-
portunities for this virus to infect; 
where it infects, it replicates; where it 
replicates, it mutates and poses the 
risk of developing a strain that, unlike 
the strains we have dealt with so far, 
evades the vaccines that we have devel-
oped. 
We have been working in a bipartisan 
manner to address the devastating ef-
fects of this second COVID–19 wave in 
India. Official testing results indicate 
that India has seen more than 340,000 
daily infections and over 4,000 daily 
deaths. But many public health offi-
cials believe these numbers understate 
the matter, and that perhaps upwards 
of 2 million people a day have been in-
fected in India. 
Of course, we have seen a slight 
abatement in those horrific numbers, 
but the problem remains. 
I want to thank the Biden adminis-
tration and commend them for orga-
nizing so many parts of the U.S. Gov-
ernment, the CDC, HHS, USAID, the 
State Department, in getting materials 
to India that will help vaccine produc-
tion, provide rapid COVID testing and, 
most importantly, oxygen support, par-
ticularly, oxygen concentrators and, of 
course, PPE to help save lives. 
This resolution is part of the ongoing 
effort of the India Caucus to help India 
at this time of need. Earlier this year, 
we sent a bipartisan request to the 
President requesting that we increase 
our assistance to India in battling 
COVID–19, particularly focusing on the 
raw materials necessary to manufac-
ture vaccines and oxygen concentra-
tion equipment. 
By early May, the United States had 
provided over $100 million worth of 
medical supplies, including that oxy-
gen support, and PPE, rapid diagnostic 
tests, and therapeutics. 
USAID also facilitated the delivery 
of 440 oxygen cylinders and concentra-
tors to India, generously donated by 
the State of California. 
We should recognize the substantial 
support of the American public. In re-
sponse to India’s crisis, the Indian- 
American community has contributed 
significantly to the effort; individuals, 
along with the private sector, continue 
to do so. 
Indian-American companies, such as 
Prime Healthcare, are working to as-
sist efforts, not only to deliver nec-
essary medical supplies, but also en-
sure that they reach the people most in 
need. And the U.S.-India Business 
Council has worked to coordinate a co-
alition of corporations, nonprofits, and 
individuals to deliver thousands of ven-
tilators and oxygen concentrators to 
India. 
This resolution stands with the peo-
ple of India as they collectively work 
to stem the spread of COVID–19, urges 
the administration to facilitate private 
and in-kind medical supply donations, 
and urges the delivery of urgently 
needed supplies to India. 
This resolution recognizes the impor-
tance of work by the U.S. Government 
and of Indian Americans in the private 
sector. 
There is no doubt that the U.S.-India 
relationship is growing closer, and that 
our assistance to India, to help over-
come this terrible COVID wave, is a 
critical part of building that relation-
ship. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
In closing, I would like to, once 
again, thank Representative SHERMAN 
and Representative CHABOT for their 
work on this resolution. 
It has been said before, but I will say 
it again, COVID–19 has shown that 
pandemics know no borders. Allies 
must come together and support one 
another during these difficult times. 
And we must work with India and the 
international community to end the 
spread of COVID–19 and prevent future 
pandemics. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this resolution, H. Res. 402, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Again, I want to thank Mr. SHERMAN 
and Mr. CHABOT for showing how this 
committee has worked in a bipartisan 
manner for the benefit of our friends 
and allies and, in this case, India. 
By passing this good, bipartisan reso-
lution, the House will send a clear mes-
sage that we stand with the people of 
India as they work to contain the 
spread of COVID–19. We recognize that 
India will continue to play an impor-
tant role in containing the further 
global spread of COVID–19, and support 
global efforts to end this pandemic. 
We also urge the administration to 
continue working with the Indian Gov-
ernment. Just yesterday, I was at the

Indian consulate in New York, where I 
had an opportunity to talk to the con-
sul general, who was very appreciative 
knowing that this bill would be on the 
House floor today; who told me to ex-
tend thank-yous to both Mr. SHERMAN 
and Mr. CHABOT; that it further shows 
American leadership and friendship 
with the people of India; and that we 
would only grow closer together to 
benefit not just our respective coun-
tries, but the rest of the world. 
This moves and helps the people in 
India. So I would like to conclude by 
just thanking everyone, once again, for 
working together in a bipartisan way 
to do the right thing for our friends 
from the country of India. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H. Res. 402, which Con-
gressman BRAD SHERMAN and I introduced to 
call attention to India’s COVID–19 second 
wave and press for needed assistance. 
India’s second wave has been a truly over-
whelming challenge. As Co-Chair of the 
House Caucus on India and Indian Americans, 
I found the images in the press, the stories 
about the lack of oxygen, and the sheer scale 
of the crisis to be truly daunting. And the suf-
fering is being felt not only in India but also 
right here at home by many of our constitu-
ents in the Indian American community, who 
have family members in India that are im-
pacted by this deadly upswing in the pan-
demic. 
While case rates in India continue to drop, 
passage of this resolution today shows that 
Congress and the American people are com-
mitted to helping India finish the battle against 
the second wave and prepare to win the war 
against COVID–19 altogether. Early in the 
pandemic, India helped us; it is our turn to 
offer a helping hand. We must continue to em-
ploy all effective measures to help them 
through this trying time. 
The crisis in India is a potent reminder of 
the toll of this pandemic and of the importance 
of preparing ourselves and the world so that 
the next disease does not cause the damage 
we have seen as a result of COVID–19. 
So I would urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H. Res. 402, ‘‘Urging the ad-
ministration to facilitate assistance in response 
to the devastating impacts of COVID–19 in 
India,’’ which advocates for direct aid to India 
as it continues to battle the devastating effects 
of COVID–19. 
I thank my colleague, Congressman SHER-
MAN of California, for authoring this important 
legislation that will save the lives of many in 
India. 
Testing results reveal that India is experi-
encing more than 340,000 new daily infections 
and more than 4,000 deaths a day, and many 
public health experts believe case rates are 
likely higher. 
India has the biggest global vaccine manu-
facturing capacity and was a major exporter of 
the vaccine. 
More than 70 low-income nations received 
vaccines made in India, with a total of more 
than 60 million doses leaving India. 
Prior to its surge in COVID–19 cases, it ex-
ported tens of millions of doses before its own 
demand skyrocketed and led to a shortage in 
some states. 
Given India’s critical role in global vaccine 
supply chains, an increase in vaccine demand 
due to the surge of COVID–19 cases within 
India is of a global concern. 
With more than 600 thousand deaths from 
COVID–19, we in the United States are no 
strangers to the devastating consequences of 
the pandemic. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, Texas has 
seen a devastating 52,458 deaths due to 
COVID–19, 6,575 of those deaths occurred in 
Harris Country, portions of which are in my 
congressional district. 
India responded to the spike in COVID–19 
cases here in the United States by lifting its 
export ban on certain therapeutics. 
With the help of widespread vaccination, the 
United States was then able to reduce the 
number of COVID–19 deaths to 4 percent of 
our peak today. 
The Indian people, who have been instru-
mental in vaccine production worldwide, de-
serve the same relief. 
In New Delhi alone, one individual dies of 
COVID–19 every 4 minutes. 
Since COVID–19 vaccine distribution began 
in the United States on December 14, 2020, 
more than 323 million doses have been ad-
ministered, fully vaccinating over 153 million 
people, that’s 46.1 percent of the total U.S. 
population. 
Now that the United States vaccine supply 
is secured, I encourage our government to 
show its support for India by passing this reso-
lution. 
This resolution calls on the Indian American 
community to continue their efforts to help 
quell the spread of the virus in India, they 
need the support of the United States govern-
ment. 
Texas is home to the second-largest Indian 
American community in the United States. 
At least 82,575 of these individuals live in 
my district, located in the West of Houston. 
Thus, it is in the interest of Harris County, 
of Texas, interest, and of the United States 
more broadly to aid India in stemming the 
spread of this virus. 
I worked hard to halt the spread of COVID– 
19 in my own district, partnering with Houston 
hospitals, local public health agencies, local 
businesses, and international corporations to 
stop the spread of the virus in local commu-
nities. 
But the pandemic will not end anywhere 
until it has ended everywhere, and as a global 
travel hub, the United States is particularly vul-
nerable to the continued spread. 
As I work on legislation to aid and support 
communities in dire need across the globe, I 
support passage of this resolution today and 
ask that my colleagues do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 402, as amended.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION 
FOR THE FUTURE ACT 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (H.R. 2225) to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 
2025, and 2026 for the National Science 
Foundation, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2225 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Science Foundation for the Future Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Over the past seven decades, the Na-
tional Science Foundation has played a crit-
ical role in advancing the United States aca-
demic research enterprise by supporting fun-
damental research and education across 
science and engineering disciplines. 
(2) Discoveries enabled by sustained invest-
ment in fundamental research and the edu-
cation of the United States science and engi-
neering 
workforce 
have 
led 
to 
trans-
formational innovations and spawned new 
industries. 
(3) While the traditional approach to in-
vestment in research has delivered myriad 
benefits to society, a concerted effort is 
needed to ensure the benefits of federally 
funded science and engineering are enjoyed 
by all Americans. 
(4) As countries around the world increase 
investments in research and STEM edu-
cation, United States global leadership in 
science and engineering is eroding, posing 
significant risks to economic competitive-
ness, national security, and public well- 
being. 
(5) To address major societal challenges 
and sustain United States leadership in inno-
vation, the Federal Government must in-
crease investments in research, broaden par-
ticipation in the STEM workforce, and bol-
ster collaborations among universities, Na-
tional Laboratories, field stations and ma-
rine laboratories, companies, labor organiza-
tions, non-profit funders of research, local 
policymakers, civil societies and stakeholder 
communities, and international partners.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
2025, the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
2225, the National Science Foundation 
for the Future Act. 
The United States has long been a 
beacon of excellence in science and en-
gineering. We are at a time of mark-
edly increased global competition in 
research and development. However, 
while we should be cognizant of our in-
creasing global competition, we must 
not be constrained by it. To continue 
to lead, we must chart our own course. 
First and foremost, we must signifi-
cantly boost funding for science. For 
years, we have allowed billions of dol-
lars of excellent research to go un-
funded. 
Second, we must fully leverage our 
STEM talent. We need to empower 
more women, people of color, rural stu-
dents, 
and 
other 
underrepresented 
groups to contribute. 
Finally, we must ensure the benefits 
of science are widely shared. We are at 
a critical juncture in our Nation’s his-
tory, and we need to be more focused 
on the role of science in our society. 
Science and technology are powerful 
tools for helping solve society’s most 
pressing challenges. But as this pan-
demic has demonstrated, some commu-
nities and their needs have long been 
overlooked. We must give voice to a 
wider range of stakeholders in guiding 
scientific research. 
For more than seven decades, the Na-
tional Science Foundation has played a 
critical role in supporting research. 
Many of the innovations that have 
fueled American prosperity and secu-
rity would not have been possible with-
out NSF-funded science. 
As we look to the agency’s future, we 
must seize this opportunity to build 
upon and leverage its strengths. I be-
lieve this legislation does just that. 
After a decade of flat funding, H.R. 
2225 provides a much-needed increase in 
funding. The bill sets NSF on a path 
for steady, sustainable growth. The bill 
addresses challenges at all levels of 
STEM education and training. It sup-
ports activities and partnerships to 
broaden participation in NSF-funded 
projects. 
Finally, this bill establishes a new di-
rectorate to accelerate progress on 
emerging technologies and advanced 
research-driven solutions to societal 
challenges like climate change and in-
equality. 
This bill is the result of over a year 
and a half of close, bipartisan collabo-
ration. The Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology held multiple 
hearings and markups to inform its de-
velopment. We incorporated feedback 
from dozens of stakeholder groups, pol-
icy experts, and thought leaders. And 
this is reflected in the fact that the bill 
has been endorsed by 50 scientific soci-
eties, universities, and industry asso-
ciations. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
LUCAS for his partnership in developing 
this legislation. I also want to thank 
his staff, in particular, Jennifer Wickre 
and Catherine Johnson, for their con-
tributions. 
And the Science Committee staff on 
the Democratic side, I would like to 
thank Dahlia Sokolov and Sara Barber 
for all of their hard work on this bill. 
I 
also 
want 
to 
thank 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s staff, Kenneth Russell DeGraff 
and Reva Price, for helping to get this 
bill to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2225, the National Science 
Foundation for the Future Act. 
This legislation is one of two Science 
Committee bills under consideration 
today to reinforce America’s global sci-
entific leadership and fend off competi-
tion from the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
Together, the NSF for the Future Act 
and the Department of Energy Science 
for the Future Act represent a com-
prehensive and sustainable approach to 
building American competitiveness. 
Before I discuss the specifics of the 
NSF for the Future Act, I want to em-
phasize why it is so critical we act now 
to counter the threat from the Com-
munist leadership in China and rein-
vest in American science and tech-
nology. 
Make no mistake, this is a threat. 
For years, China has been working to 
steal, both literally and figuratively, 
our playbook for innovation. That is 
because leading the world in science 
and technology gives you a significant 
advantage when it comes to national 
security, cybersecurity, and economic 
growth. 
It is no wonder, then, that we have 
seen the Chinese Communist Party 
pursue a technological advantage over 
us through forced acquisitions, malign 
foreign talent programs, and intellec-
tual property theft. 
They are also outspending us, plain 
and simple. China’s R&D spending in-
creased more than 50 percent between 
2011 and 2016. In that same period, our 
investment fell by 12 percent, in abso-
lute terms. 
There is no question, we must act 
now to redouble our commitment to 
American research and development if 
we are to remain the global leader in 
science and technology. 
This issue is so important that even 
our colleagues in the Senate have de-
cided to address it. And while some leg-
islative observers have noted that their 
approach to this has been less orga-
nized and focused, I appreciate that 
they recognize the urgency of the prob-
lem we are facing. 
While the Senate chose to tack on 
countless special interest provisions, 
the 
House 
Science 
Committee 
ap-
proached this in a deliberative manner, 
spending more than a year working 
with stakeholders in government, aca-
demia, and industry to identify the 
best way to invest in our research en-
terprise and support American com-
petitiveness. 
The result is two bipartisan bills that 
significantly increase research funding 
while adding strong protections to 
keep it safe from foreign theft. 
The NSF for the Future Act doubles 
funding for basic research over 5 years, 
investing a total of $78 billion. 
It also includes $13 billion in funding 
for a new Directorate for Science and 
Engineering 
Solutions, 
focused 
on 
translating the discoveries funded by 
the foundation into solutions that can 
be applied to national and societal 
challenges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3203 
June 28, 2021 
H.R. 2225 helps expand our STEM 
workforce so that, as we create the 
technological jobs of the future, we are 
also developing American workers to 
fill them. It invests in STEM education 
at every level, from pre-K to post-doc 
programs, ensuring all Americans have 
access to high-quality STEM resources. 
Our bill also expands the geographic 
diversity of American R&D by building 
research capabilities at minority-serv-
ing institutions and universities out-
side of the top 100 research institu-
tions. 
Importantly, the NSF for the Future 
Act has a strong focus on protecting 
taxpayer-funded research from adver-
saries like China, Russia, and Iran. 
Among the protections included in the 
bill is a provision that prohibits any 
grant recipients from participating in 
malign talent recruitment programs, 
like the Thousand Talents program. 
Protections like these are all the 
more important as we increase invest-
ments in our research enterprise. 
H.R. 2225 is a strategic and sustain-
able approach to investing in America 
science and technology. I would like to 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Chairwoman 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, for all of the 
work she has done with me to get this 
bill before the floor today. 
At every step in this process, Science 
Committee Republicans and Democrats 
have worked together to identify the 
challenges 
we 
face 
and 
craft 
the 
strongest possible legislation to sup-
port American competitiveness. That 
is due in large part to the chair-
woman’s leadership and our shared 
commitment to making sure America 
has the best research and development 
enterprise in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, with U.S. leadership in 
science and technology at risk, the 
U.S. must recommit to supporting 
basic research, cutting-edge facilities, 
and a thriving domestic STEM work-
force. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to take action now by sup-
porting the NSF for the Future Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Research 
and Technology. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the NSF for the Future Act, 
a bipartisan bill to revitalize one of the 
most important pillars of our Federal 
Government’s investments in innova-
tion, the National Science Foundation. 
I certainly want to recognize the 
great work of Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and Ranking Member LUCAS for their 
leadership in developing this forward- 
looking legislation. I was so proud to 
help 
usher 
it 
through 
my 
Sub-
committee on Research and Tech-
nology. 
The commitment to bipartisan col-
laboration and engagement with a wide 
range of stakeholders has resulted in a 
carefully crafted bill that provides a 
much-needed infusion of funding and 
addresses needs across the agency’s 
portfolio. 
The NSF for the Future Act has been 
endorsed by nearly 50 organizations, in-
cluding the AFL–CIO, American Soci-
ety of Civil Engineers, the Semicon-
ductor Industry Association, and high-
er education institutions across the 
country. 
The bill puts forth a suite of sweep-
ing proposals, from scaling up preK–12 
STEM education research innovations 
and modernizing higher education stu-
dent training to funding more research 
infrastructure and expanding opportu-
nities to participate in NSF-funded 
projects. 
The NSF for the Future Act also sup-
ports the evolution of the NSF by 
ramping up support for use-inspired 
and translational research through the 
creation of a partnership-driven, solu-
tions-oriented directorate. 
The National Science Foundation 
plays a pivotal role in our research eco-
system. As the only Federal agency 
charged with supporting fundamental 
research 
across 
all 
scientific 
dis-
ciplines, we cannot risk undermining 
or diminishing this function. Our ca-
pacity to innovate will be constrained 
if we choke off the flow of fundamental 
research dollars. 
As members of the Science Com-
mittee, we know all too well what is at 
stake and what we are doing to con-
duct our due diligence here today. We 
have held hearing after hearing to ex-
plore the challenges and opportunities 
for advancing NSF’s mission through a 
comprehensive reauthorization bill. 
We heard from the NSF’s director 
and chair of the National Science 
Board that the agency is poised to take 
on an infusion of funding and an expan-
sion of its mission to deliver the bene-
fits of research to the American people. 
We 
heard 
from 
stakeholders 
all 
across the country in academia and 
from the private sector and innovation 
policy experts that the NSF is an es-
sential asset that has been squeezed by 
flat budgets for too long. 
Yes, here today is a bipartisan effort 
to commit to doubling scientific re-
search funding in this country. We all 
remember the headline we got several 
years ago that diminished the funding 
for this agency, that gave us the pro-
jection of a lost generation in sci-
entific research, yet here today we are 
committed to action because innova-
tion is the great propellor of this Na-
tion. 
The 
challenges—the 
unique 
chal-
lenges that we have faced in the 21st 
century have been bested time and 
time again because of what we do as 
Americans: We innovate. And I know 
that all too well as a Member of Con-
gress from Michigan dedicated to the 
production and the patents and the 
hard work to produce results. 
Increasing the budget of the NSF is 
also not nearly enough. A new direc-
torate charged with use-inspired re-
search with a focus on expanding op-
portunities, forging new partnerships, 
and engagement with the public is 
needed to chart the course forward for 
this agency. It is time. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. WALTZ), the ranking member of 
the Research and Technology Sub-
committee. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2225, the NSF for the 
Future Act, which I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of, along with Chair-
woman 
JOHNSON, 
Ranking 
Member 
LUCAS, and Chairwoman STEVENS. 
As ranking member of the Research 
and Technology Subcommittee, I am 
proud of the process this bill went 
through to get here today, with well 
over a year’s work, including meetings, 
roundtables, legislative hearings, and 
two committee markups. 
The final bill includes over 13 Repub-
lican 
amendments 
and 
standalone 
pieces 
of 
legislation 
and 
11 
rec-
ommendations from the House GOP’s 
China Task Force. It is projected that 
China surpassed the United States in 
2019, in total research and development 
spending. 
I would like to thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and Ranking Member LUCAS 
for their leadership throughout this 
process, which set the tone for devel-
oping thoughtful legislation. 
H.R. 2225 takes important steps in ex-
panding the mission of the National 
Science Foundation to ensure we main-
tain our edge against rising global 
competition, while protecting the foun-
dation’s primary mission of supporting 
fundamental research. 
It makes key investments in the 
STEM workforce to expand the Amer-
ican talent pipeline. It supports world- 
class research facilities, like Embry- 
Riddle, Bethune-Cookman, and Stetson 
Universities, all of which are in my dis-
trict. It promotes the research needed 
to develop revolutionary technologies 
that are crucial to our national and 
economic security. 
While making these investments, we 
also secure taxpayer-funded research 
and technologies from adversaries like 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
The National Science Foundation In-
spector General is seeing a 1,000 per-
cent increase in FBI referrals for re-
search theft inquiries. H.R. 2225 gives 
the NSF security office the resources, 
the authority, and the tools for the 
foundation, for the sponsoring institu-
tions, and for the applicants to identify 
and address malign foreign influence 
and to address research theft. 
The bill also instructs the NSF to de-
velop mandatory security training to 
ensure 
that 
individual 
researchers, 
frankly, have no more excuses and that 
they understand the threat and the 
Federal policies and guidelines. 
Lastly, 
Representative 
RANDY 
FEENSTRA and I successfully added an 
amendment during the full committee 
markup that bans grant applicants 
from participating in malign foreign

talent programs, like the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s Thousand Talents pro-
gram. 
It is critical that we strike a balance 
between keeping our research enter-
prise open, but also protecting it from 
adversaries who seek to take advan-
tage of our open system. 
There is more work to be done, but I 
think these provisions take some big 
steps in striking that balance. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for this bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER). 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, today we 
are considering H.R. 2225, the NSF for 
the Future Act; and H.R. 3593, the DOE 
Science for the Future Act. Both are 
tributes to the thoughtful bipartisan-
ship of the leadership and the staff of 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, on which I have the honor 
of serving. 
Last Congress, the Science Com-
mittee found itself in the remarkable 
position of discussing dueling bipar-
tisan proposals to essentially double 
the science budgets, which, needless to 
say, represents a big change from years 
past. 
Out of that shared commitment to 
the future came the thoughtful and bi-
partisan NSF for the Future Act and 
the DOE Science for the Future Act. 
These bills, which represent significant 
and overdue increases to the budgets 
for the NSF and the DOE Office of 
Science, are crucial to ensuring that 
our Nation maintains its leadership in 
the science that will continue to 
change the world. 
H.R. 2225 was specifically written to 
ensure that the NSF will have the 
funds to accept a much larger fraction 
of the qualified research proposals that 
it receives every year, which is the sin-
gle most important thing that we can 
do to ensure the health of the science 
it supports. 
b 1715 
H.R. 3593 contains aggressive but fea-
sible budget profiles for the existing 
programs of DOE’s Office of Science. It 
has specific language to reexamine op-
portunities to expand these programs 
into new areas under these more ambi-
tious but now, hopefully, realistic 
budget growth scenarios so that next- 
generation projects in fields like nu-
clear fusion, bioinformatics, energy 
storage, basic energy research, and 
much more can now be contemplated. 
As the only Ph.D. physicist in Con-
gress, I urge my colleagues to support 
these bills, which I am proudly cospon-
soring, to provide our scientific re-
searchers with the support that they 
need to lead us into the future. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. 
FEENSTRA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Chairwoman JOHNSON and Rank-
ing Member LUCAS for all the work 
they have done on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the National Science Foundation for 
the Future Act. This legislation con-
tains several provisions that would 
help ensure the United States con-
tinues to be a global leader in science 
and technology. It invests in critical 
STEM programs and research that will 
pave the way for new and exciting 
technological developments. 
I am pleased that this legislation 
also includes a proposal that I intro-
duced to protect American intellectual 
property from falling into the wrong 
hands. My proposal, which passed the 
Science Committee with unanimous 
support, prevents government-funded 
researchers 
from 
participating 
in 
projects that are run by so-called for-
eign countries of concern, including 
China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and 
others defined by the State Depart-
ment. 
Taxpayer dollars should not be spent 
on research that could end up in the 
hands of our competitors or our adver-
saries. This is especially true when it 
comes to China. My bipartisan proposal 
stands up to the Chinese Communist 
Party and ensures that our taxpayer 
dollars are spent wisely. 
The NSF for the Future Act also con-
tains language that I have worked on 
with Congressman MCNERNEY
to ad-
vance 
precision 
agriculture 
tech-
nology. These provisions aim to bolster 
research and development in precision 
farming practices, which will help our 
producers improve their efficiency and 
increase their bottom line. 
In sum, the National Science Foun-
dation for the Future Act includes im-
portant provisions that will protect 
American interests and help empower 
our agricultural community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking 
Member LUCAS for their extraordinary 
bipartisan leadership on these bills. 
These two bills recognize the urgency 
of Federal scientific investment. 
Over the past few decades, Federal 
spending on R&D flatlined as a share of 
our economy, and it has fallen in abso-
lute terms. Meanwhile, global competi-
tors 
jump-started 
their 
economic 
growth through such investments that 
spur innovation. 
Maintaining our leadership in re-
search and development is arguably 
more important than ever. Now is the 
time to be bold in our vision of what is 
possible. We shortchange the Nation 
every year when we refuse to fund a 
rich portfolio of research opportuni-
ties. 
I want to talk about the NSF for the 
Future Act. It is part of the remedy, 
and it strikes the appropriate balance 
of expanding popular and effective 
projects and programs while expanding 
the Foundation’s role and mandate to 
new areas of evolving technologies. 
The approach to the creation of a 
new directorate outlined in the bill 
sets an appropriate benchmark as we 
engage with the Senate, and it has re-
ceived overwhelming support from the 
academic, scientific, and business com-
munities. 
We need to make sure we get this 
right. 
The bill would allow NSF to improve 
the speed and scale of its core mission 
to advance basic and fundamental re-
search while promoting innovative so-
lutions to the challenges we face as a 
nation. 
We must support this effort, the NSF 
bill, as well as the Department of En-
ergy Science for the Future Act. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
these two pieces of legislation. I com-
mend the committee for its excellent 
work. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2225, the 
NSF for the Future Act, legislation 
that invests in our country’s future 
through targeted investments in re-
search and innovation at the univer-
sity level, K–12 STEM education, and 
the development and commercializa-
tion of new technologies. 
I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 2225, 
which provides our country and the Na-
tional Science Foundation with the 
tools to preserve our technological and 
economic supremacy in the face of the 
shifting patterns of global competitive-
ness. 
This bipartisan legislation would au-
thorize $50 billion over 5 years for 
American innovation and basic re-
search. Additionally, the legislation 
ensures taxpayer investments in inno-
vation and research are protected from 
theft and espionage by the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
H.R. 2225 also contains important 
provisions to ensure our country is de-
veloping a 21st century workforce by 
investing in STEM education at all lev-
els, from pre-K through 12th grades. I 
am proud to have worked with my col-
leagues, Representative GWEN MOORE, 
Ranking Member LUCAS, and Chair-
woman JOHNSON, to include my legisla-
tion, H.R. 3859, the Innovations in In-
formal STEM Learning Act. 
H.R. 3859 sets up the pre-K through 
eighth grade informal STEM program, 
which directs the NSF Director to 
award 
competitive, 
merit-reviewed 
grants that support student participa-
tion in competitions, after-school ac-
tivities, and field experiences related 
to STEM education. Additionally, this 
legislation would bridge the achieve-
ment gap for minority and rural stu-
dents by prioritizing STEM education 
in those communities. 
As our Nation fights to stay ahead as 
the world leader in innovation, science, 
and technology, we must rely on the 
strength of our Nation’s diversity. We 
cannot afford to compete in the 21st 
century economy and against China 
with one hand tied behind our back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3205 
June 28, 2021 
I commend Ranking Member LUCAS 
and Chairwoman JOHNSON’s leadership 
for reaching a bipartisan agreement on 
this legislation. I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
H.R. 2225. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the NSF for the Future 
Act, a critical piece of legislation that 
would bolster our Nation’s research en-
terprise and enhance our status as a 
world leader in science and research. It 
is so wonderful that it has been done in 
a completely bipartisan way. 
Included in this legislation is a bipar-
tisan bill I introduced, the NSF Tech-
nology Research Institutes Act. This 
important bill would create a grant 
program at NSF that will fund tech-
nology research activities at institutes 
of higher education. This will further 
our national innovation enterprise and 
ensure our technology workforce has 
the requisite skill set to work on cut-
ting-edge research as the key to suc-
cess in the 21st century. 
This program will enable our aca-
demic institutions, including those I 
represent in the Research Triangle 
area of North Carolina, to further pro-
vide their students with critical re-
search experience to build the robust 
technology workforce our country ur-
gently needs. 
I look forward to working with the 
Senate to ensure this critical bill is 
signed into law. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. OBERNOLTE), the ranking 
member of the Investigations and Over-
sight Subcommittee. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2225, the Na-
tional Science Foundation for the Fu-
ture Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been increasingly 
alarmed over the last few months at 
the foreign-based attacks on our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. Several weeks 
ago, the attack against Colonial Pipe-
line disrupted the supply of gasoline 
throughout the East Coast. Also sev-
eral weeks ago, the computer attack 
against JBS meat processing threat-
ened to disrupt our Nation’s food sup-
ply. 
Mr. Speaker, the reason these are 
particularly concerning to me as a 
computer scientist is the data that in-
dicates that we have seriously under-
invested in our computer science work-
force over the last several decades, par-
ticularly compared with other coun-
tries. 
This bill is a very meaningful step to-
ward solving that problem. It would 
roughly double the NSF’s investment 
in basic scientific research over the 
next few years, particularly in fields 
like computer science. 
It includes a bill that I sponsored, 
H.R. 
3844, 
the 
Fellowships 
and 
Traineeships for Early-Career AI Re-
searchers Act, that would make mean-
ingful investments in new fellowships 
and new traineeships to enable the 
next generation of Americans to be-
come educated and skilled in the field 
of artificial intelligence. 
Another bill that we are considering 
on the floor tonight, the Department of 
Energy Science for the Future Act, 
would continue those investments. It 
includes another piece of legislation 
that I authored, the Next Generation 
Computing Research and Development 
Act, that would make meaningful in-
vestments in exascale computing and 
next-generation 
computing 
capabili-
ties. 
Mr. Speaker, taken together, this 
legislation will attempt to address the 
problems that have plagued computer 
science and technical education in this 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, no discussion of this 
legislation would be complete without 
some praise for the bipartisan path 
that this legislation has followed. This 
legislation is bipartisan. It includes 
meaningful contributions from both 
parties. It is deliberate. It has taken 
place over the course of more than a 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, it is inclusive. It in-
cludes input from hundreds of different 
industry and academic institutions. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the path that 
legislation in this Chamber should fol-
low. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 
2225. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I have no further requests for time, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
My colleagues have done a great job 
today of explaining all the many rea-
sons we need to pass the National 
Science Foundation for the Future Act 
to keep America globally competitive. 
I thank them for their support of this 
legislation. 
I also want to thank my staff for all 
the hard work they have done on this 
bill. America’s scientific and techno-
logical competitiveness has been my 
highest priority as ranking member of 
the Science Committee. My staff has 
worked long and hard to create a 
smart, strategic approach to doubling 
our investments in research and devel-
opment, and I appreciate all they have 
done. 
I also want to thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON’s staff for working so closely 
with us to ensure that we have a bipar-
tisan plan to invest in America’s 
science and technology leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the NSF for the Future Act, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I simply urge all of my colleagues to 
support the National Science Founda-
tion for the Future Act. 
It is really time to acknowledge that 
we did have to do a lot of extra home-
work to come to the final portions of 
this bill, and we did it collaboratively. 
We involved the entire scientific com-
munity, and we believe we have done a 
great job. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2225, the 
National Science Foundation for the Future 
Act, includes my bill, H.R. 3795, to ensure 
educators from the Northern Mariana Islands, 
Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa 
are represented in the annual Presidential 
Awards for Excellence in Math and Science 
Teaching. 
Established by Congress in 1983, the Presi-
dential Award is the highest recognition that 
an elementary or secondary school mathe-
matics or science teacher may receive in the 
United States. Over 4,800 teachers have been 
recognized for their contributions in the class-
room and to their profession. 
Unlike the fifty States, the District of Colum-
bia, Puerto Rico and Department of Defense 
schools, each of which may recognize a 
STEM educator, no more than two awards in 
total can go to teachers from the four insular 
areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Vir-
gin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. This 
limitation has resulted in many years in which 
no teacher from one of those four areas is se-
lected. No teacher from the Marianas, for in-
stance, was selected last year. And this lack 
of recognition defeats the purpose of the pro-
gram, which is to inspire excellence within 
each area and provide a role model for other 
local STEM educators to emulate. These stat-
utory limits, also, unfairly deny deserving edu-
cators in the insular areas the national rec-
ognition and professional development oppor-
tunities we provide to STEM educators else-
where in our nation. 
My bill provides a more equitable process 
by requiring awards to at least one teacher 
from each of the four areas. By ensuring 
teachers from all parts of America are rep-
resented, more students and schools will ben-
efit from the expert-led training programs and 
collaboration opportunities available to award-
ees during their visit to our nation’s capital. 
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON and Ranking 
Member LUCAS for all their support to include 
into H.R. 2225 this important measure. 
I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2225. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in proud support of H.R. 2225, the ‘‘Na-
tional Science foundation for the Future Act,’’ 
which authorizes appropriations for the Na-
tional Science Foundation for the next five fis-
cal years. 
As a former member of the House Science 
committee, I believe science and engineering 
academic research is an essential investment 
due to the ongoing cybersecurity, national se-
curity, and public wellbeing threats attacking 
the Nation. 
The National Science Foundation (NSF) 
supports basic research that is a primary driv-
er of the U.S. economy, enhances the nation’s 
security, and advances knowledge to sustain 
global leadership. 
Specifically, the NSF is the only federal 
agency whose mission includes support for 
fundamental science and engineering fields. 
NSF funds research and education in most 
fields of science and engineering, providing 
grants and cooperative agreements to more 
than 2,000 colleges, universities, K–12 school

systems, businesses, informal science organi-
zations, and other research organizations 
throughout the U.S. 
Pursuant to the National Science Founda-
tion for the Future Act, NSF will contract with 
the National Academies of Science, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine to assess the status and 
opportunities for Pre-K through 12 science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics, in-
cluding computer science, (STEM) education 
research. 
The NSF contributions have specifically 
benefitted Texas institutions by previously in-
vesting $46,828,000 to STEM education and 
$356,731,000 in fundamental research. 
The National Science Foundation for the Fu-
ture Act will continue to impact Texas STEM 
education. 
For example, money distributed through the 
National Science Foundation go to University 
of Houston STEM student researching at The 
University of Houston Division of Research 
Department. 
In the past, the NSF funding helped re-
searchers at Rice University develop a nano-
technology-based ‘‘trap-and-zap’’ approach to 
absorbing and deactivating antibiotic-resistant 
genes. 
More importantly the money from the NSF is 
contributed to the Science and Technology 
Enhancement Program (STEP) at Texas 
Southern University to help increase the num-
ber of African-American and female graduates 
in all STEM fields. 
H.R. 2225 carries out a national initiative to 
facilitate the development of networks and 
partnerships to broaden participation in STEM 
studies and careers of historically underrep-
resented groups like students at Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). 
The funds allocated to STEM programs like 
Texas Southern University contribute to Presi-
dent Biden’s plan to help build up and finan-
cially support Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs). 
Research has found that HBCUs are vital to 
helping underrepresented students move to 
the top of the income ladder. 
HBCUs are only three percent of four-year 
universities, and their graduates make up ap-
proximately 80 percent of Black judges, half of 
Black lawyers and doctors, and 25 percent of 
Black undergraduates earning STEM degrees. 
President Biden wants us to invest in 
HBCU’s by creating or expanding educational 
programs in high-demand fields (e.g., STEM, 
computer sciences, nursing, and allied health), 
with an additional $2 billion directed towards 
building a pipeline of skilled health care work-
ers with graduate degrees. 
Through the American Jobs Plan, President 
Biden wants to eliminate racial and gender in-
equities in research and development and 
science, technology, engineering, and math. 
President Biden wants to invest $40 billion 
in upgrading research infrastructure in labora-
tories across the country, including brick-and- 
mortar facilities and computing capabilities and 
networks. These funds would be allocated 
across the federal R&D agencies, including at 
the Department of Energy. 
Half of those funds will be reserved for His-
torically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institu-
tions, including the creation of a new national 
lab focused on climate that will be affiliated 
with an HBCU. 
H.R. 2225 awards the NSF billions of dollars 
in the next five years to address significant so-
cietal challenges and sustain United States 
leadership in innovation by increasing invest-
ments in research, specifically for underrep-
resented populations, like HBCU students, in 
STEM. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 2225, the ’’National Science foundation 
for the Future Act,’’ to ensure that we fund our 
STEM programs to prepare us for the future 
better. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2225, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, on that

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

under international agreements. 
SEC. 15. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
3593, the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am very pleased today that we are 
considering the Department of Energy 
Science for the Future Act. 
This well-vetted, bipartisan bill will 
provide the first ever comprehensive 
authorization for the Department of 
Energy’s Office of Science. This office 
accounts for over half of the Depart-
ment’s nondefense research and devel-
opment budget and supports a wide 
range of research facilities and activi-
ties that are critical to the U.S. com-
petitiveness and for enabling our clean 
energy future. 
The Office of Science is the Nation’s 
largest supporter of research in the 
physical sciences, and it is the lead 
Federal agency supporting scientific 
research for energy applications. H.R. 
3593 authorizes significant, steady, and 
sustainable growth for the office’s 
wide-ranging research from climate 
science to quantum science, and every-
thing in between. 
The bill also ensures the office’s con-
struction projects and upgrades to its 
world-class scientific user facility have 
the resources they need to be com-
pleted on time and on budget. 
H.R. 3593 is a substantial effort in the 
fight against climate change. The bill 
authorizes research to advance the 
next generation of clean energy tech-
nologies to help us reach our shared 
goals of developing energy that is 
clean, sustainable, reliable, and afford-
able. In carrying out these activities, 
this bill also directs the office to sup-
port the development of a skilled, di-
verse, and inclusive workforce for 
clean energy researchers, scientists, 
and professionals. 
That is why the bill has been en-
dorsed by stakeholders in the business 
community, like the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce; the academic community, 
like the Association of American Uni-
versities; major scientific associations, 
like the American Physical and Chem-
ical Societies; and significant environ-
mental organizations like the Environ-
mental Defense Fund. 
This bill is another strong example of 
the collaborative bipartisan approach 
that our committee has taken. Rank-
ing Member LUCAS’ collaborative ap-
proach has been crucial in getting us to 
where we are today. 
Before I yield back, I would like to 
recognize the Committee on Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
staff 
who 
worked on this bill, and in some cases 
for several years now: Adam Rosen-
berg, Alyse Huffman, Sangina Wright, 
and Bill Kallen. I also recognize the ef-
forts of Ranking Member LUCAS’ staff 
in helping us to get where we are 
today, including Hillary O’Brien, Jenn 
Wickre, and Daniel Dziadon. 
I strongly urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill to dramatically improve the Na-
tion’s competitiveness and help lead us 
all to a brighter future. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3593, the De-
partment of Energy Science for the Fu-
ture Act. This legislation, along with 
H.R. 2225, the NSF for the Future Act 
is a comprehensive and strategic ap-
proach for investing in American re-
search and development. 
For decades, America has been the 
global leader in science and technology 
development. That success is no acci-
dent. It is the result of two things: A 
cultural commitment to innovation 
and exploration, and a sustained in-
vestment in basic research. 
This is what makes us uniquely suc-
cessful. The Federal Government funds 
high-risk, high-reward basic research 
that expands our fundamental knowl-
edge of science and technology. This 
research, which is too costly for the 
marketplace to fund, produces discov-
eries that can then be commercialized 
through private industry. 
Our system maximizes taxpayer in-
vestment 
and 
takes 
advantage 
of 
strong public-private partnerships to 
keep America at the cutting edge of 
technological progress. 
Unfortunately, our adversaries in 
China are investing more than us in 
R&D in an attempt to take over the 
lead in science and technology. 
The way to stay ahead of China isn’t 
adopting their method of a top-down, 
government-mandated, 
applied 
re-
search agenda. It is to reinvest in the 
basic 
research, 
infrastructure, 
and 
STEM workers that have always driven 
American progress. 
H.R. 3593 does just that. It is the first 
comprehensive authorization of the Of-
fice of Science, which is our Nation’s 
largest Federal sponsor of basic re-
search in the physical sciences. The 
DOE Science for the Future Act invests 
$50 billion over 5 years in the Office of 
Science and the national labs, national 
scientific user facilities, and the thou-
sands of researchers its supports. 
The DOE Science for the Future Act 
is an investment in our technological 
and clean energy future. It funds re-
search into materials, chemical, bio-
logical, and environmental sciences, as 
well as fusion energy, advanced com-
puting capacities, and cutting edge 
technologies like artificial intelligence 
and quantum sciences. 
We already know that investments in 
basic research pay large dividends. For 
example, basic research conducted in 
our national labs gave us improved hy-
draulic fracturing technology and al-
lowed us to produce more clean natural 
gas. This reduced emissions, lowered 
energy costs for Americans, and helped 
us become a net total energy exporter 
for the first time in decades. 
That is why everyone who cares 
about clean energy must care about 
the research supported by H.R. 3593. In-
vesting in high-risk, early-stage re-
search into cutting edge technologies 
is the only way to ensure that America 
stays at the head of the clean energy 
economy. 
Another important provision in the 
DOE Science for the Future Act is the 
creation of a crosscutting Emerging In-
fectious Disease Research Initiative to 
build on DOE’s work to better model, 
understand, and fight infectious dis-
eases. 
As they have shown time and again 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, our na-
tional labs have an important role to 
play in supporting public health. This 
legislation gives them the resources 
they need to continue this work. 
H.R. 3593 also funds much-needed in-
frastructure updates for our national 
labs and user facilities. Our ability to 
conduct world-leading science depends 
on having access to world-leading 
equipment and facilities. 
It also requires having skilled STEM 
professionals to conduct that research. 
Our bill includes workforce develop-
ment and education provisions so that 
we have a thriving STEM pipeline to 
fill the technological jobs of the future. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3593 is a forward- 
looking bill that is badly needed right 
now to drive American progress and to 
keep us globally competitive. 
As with the NSF for the Future Act, 
this legislation was drafted with exten-
sive input in a bipartisan fashion, and 
the result is a strategic and responsible 
investment in the next generation of 
breakthrough energy technologies. 
I thank my friend Chairwoman JOHN-
SON for all her work with me on this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass 
this now. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin 
(Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3219 
June 28, 2021 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3593, 
the Department of Energy Science for 
the Future Act. As a newly minted 
member of the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee, I was so proud 
to see my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle work so hard on this bill to 
pass it through committee with amend-
ments from both Democrats and Re-
publicans. I, too, had an opportunity as 
a newly minted member to make an 
impact on this important legislation. 
And I think that it wasn’t by acci-
dent, and I thank the chairwoman of 
the committee, Representative EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON and Representative 
LUCAS, the ranking member, for cre-
ating the environment in which we 
could do our work and craft this impor-
tant legislation. 
As you all have heard, the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Science is a 
hub of technological advancement and 
research designed to tackle our great-
est scientific challenges facing the 
United States. 
Through several hearings in the com-
mittee, we learned about the DOE Of-
fice of Science’s ongoing efforts to sup-
port research and to find solutions. 
This bill allows the Office of Science 
to continue carrying out nondefense re-
search on a vast array of critical areas. 
It supports research to modernize our 
energy infrastructure, allowing us the 
tools to overhaul our outdated energy 
grid to more climate-friendly solu-
tions. And we, of course, have seen 
some of the catastrophic events caused 
by the lack of current technologies 
that recognize the climate action. 
It funds continuing studies in artifi-
cial intelligence and quantum com-
puting, keeping pace with our competi-
tors in the tech sector and readying 
our cybersecurity defenses from our ad-
versaries, as we have seen up close and 
personal the cost to our country to not 
keep abreast of these technologies. 
During markup, I was able to offer a 
provision that was included in the bill 
that is before the House today that 
would prioritize clean water and water-
shed research at the Office of Science. 
My amendment directs the Office of 
Science to support clean water and wa-
tershed research that increases the 
quality and quantity of water across 
America, including the treasured Great 
Lakes. 
My 
home 
district 
of 
Milwaukee 
shares a coast with Lake Michigan, 
which I consider one of my most impor-
tant constituents. 
It is imperative that we study the 
harmful effects of water pollution, 
make investments in technologies to 
combat the contamination of our wa-
terways, and to protect drinking water 
sources that are critical to every man, 
woman, and child. We also need to 
make sure that water continues to be a 
resource for commerce. 
My amendment also ensures that rel-
evant communities, research institu-
tions, and nonprofits will be at the 
table when DOE carries out these 
tasks. Innovation doesn’t occur in a 
vacuum, and it is critical that these re-
search efforts have real world input 
from key stakeholders. 
Before I close, I want to mention 
something about the National Science 
Foundation, H.R. 2225, which we con-
sidered on this floor today. I thank the 
chair and the ranking member for lean-
ing in again to put this together in giv-
ing Members an opportunity to weigh 
in. 
As you all know, the NSF is the 
funder of more than 1,800 institutions 
in the United States, and they provide 
tremendous resources, funding, and op-
portunities for STEM students. I have 
been able to weigh in to make sure 
that there is diversity and opportunity 
in STEM. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
3593, the Department of Energy Science 
for the Future Act. 
b 1745 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER), the ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Energy. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member LUCAS and the 
chairwoman of the full committee, Ms. 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. With this bill, 
the two of them have perfectly dem-
onstrated how a committee can actu-
ally function—even with occasional 
disagreements—to 
prioritize 
shared 
goals and produce truly great bipar-
tisan products. They are to be con-
gratulated. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3593, the Department of 
Energy Science for the Future Act. 
After over a decade of budget re-
quests, hearings, stakeholder input, 
and information-gathering, I say with 
a sigh of relief and a great deal of joy 
that the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology has a bipartisan and 
comprehensive Office of Science au-
thorization. 
Although it has taken a little longer 
than I would have expected, it couldn’t 
come at a better time. America’s sci-
entific enterprise has never faced a 
more serious threat from global com-
petition than it does right now—today. 
Innovative science discoveries and 
advance 
technology 
development 
aren’t just aspirations; they are the ac-
tual key to our national security, as 
well as our economic prosperity. That 
is because innovation and technology 
are exactly what the Chinese Com-
munist Party has prioritized in its goal 
to overtake the United States of Amer-
ica as a global leader in industries of 
the future. 
Mr. Speaker, if we want to maintain 
our key edge in technology areas, like 
quantum information science and arti-
ficial intelligence, and combat the 
threat of another country controlling 
the development of those cutting-edge 
technologies and standards, we must 
take action now. 
Mr. Speaker, the solution is really 
quite simple. We have to invest in 
American innovation. Just that simple. 
We must invest in our facilities and 
our research right here in the United 
States so that we can ensure the 
United States remains the global lead-
er in science. 
How exactly we go about that might 
be the subject of some debate, but I 
fully believe that the bill that we have 
before us today is the best course of ac-
tion. 
The Department of Energy’s Office of 
Science has time and time again dem-
onstrated that basic science research is 
the most effective way to encourage 
development of those new technologies. 
And as the largest Federal sponsor of 
basic research in the physical sciences, 
with unparalleled research capabilities 
and 
infrastructure, 
the 
Office 
of 
Science and its national laboratories 
are uniquely equipped to help America 
compete. 
By authorizing cutting-edge research 
programs with a responsible, scalable 
funding increase and a strategic road-
map for DOE, federally funded discov-
eries made through the Office of 
Science will pave the way for both pub-
lic and private American innovators to 
license technologies and to launch 
those startups. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition, the Office 
of Science research in materials and 
chemical science, biological and envi-
ronmental research, and fusion energy 
will not only maintain our lead in 
science, but will also lay the founda-
tion for the next generation of clean, 
secure, and exportable energy tech-
nologies. Don’t miss that: Clean, ex-
portable, and secure technologies. 
Maximizing the Office of Science’s 
role in our Federal research enterprise 
is how we win. This great legislative 
body and the Federal Government as a 
whole cannot and will not duplicate a 
nonmarket economy by forcing man-
dates and regulations. Instead, we can 
arm our dynamic private sector with 
the tools necessary to commercialize 
sustainable, affordable, and scalable 
energy solutions. Again, don’t miss 
that. 
Through the DOE Science of the Fu-
ture Act, we are prioritizing critical re-
search areas and investing in the 
science and technology that will drive 
development of those technologies into 
the next generation. This will allow 
America’s economy to thrive while re-
ducing global emissions and allowing 
market-based solutions to flourish. 
Don’t miss that. 
Robust and consistent support for the 
Office of Science is crucial to the suc-
cess and security of the U.S. innova-
tion ecosystem, U.S. energy independ-
ence, and U.S. security. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill does that in a 
clear, streamlined fashion. It is not 
bogged down by outside interests or 
unrelated provisions. We won’t just 
keep up with China and other foreign 
adversaries; we will outpace them and 
lead, just like the United States of 
America has always done. 
That is a good thing. That is a very 
good thing, by the way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3220 
June 28, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I take a moment to 
thank the many stakeholders who have 
worked so hard to get this critical leg-
islation done right. Hats off to all of 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. It is a great one. It is 
high time we had this one on the floor. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s scientific and 
technological 
leadership 
is 
being 
threatened by the Chinese Communist 
Party, and we must act urgently to re-
invest in our own research and develop-
ment enterprise. 
H.R. 3593 redoubles our commitment 
to the basic research conducted by the 
Department 
of 
Energy’s 
Office 
of 
Science and our national laboratories. 
Together with the NSF for the Future 
Act, it is a comprehensive and sustain-
able approach to American competi-
tiveness. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my staff for ev-
erything they have done to help draft 
this important legislation. I thank my 
friend, Chairwoman JOHNSON, and her 
staff for working with us to include Re-
publican priorities and ensure that this 
is a truly bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me sim-
ply say that we on this committee 
know that we are the committee that 
will determine the future of our Nation 
and the standing of the world when it 
comes to science. And we have taken 
our work very seriously. I am grateful 
to all of the members. We know we 
cannot be any better than the people 
who we involve and use their talents, 
and we must do that as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the mem-
bers of the committee on both sides of 
the aisle for staying with us and work-
ing through all that we know we need 
to do to come together to look out for 
the future of our Nation’s scientific en-
terprise. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of the persons, 
my colleagues, to support this bill and 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3593, as

HONORING 
OUR 
PROMISES 
THROUGH EXPEDITION FOR AF-
GHAN SIVS ACT OF 2021 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3385) to waive the requirement to 
undergo a medical examination for 
aliens who are otherwise eligible for 
special immigrant status under the Af-
ghan Allies Protection Act of 2009, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

H.R. 3385 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and to include extra-
neous material on H.R. 3385. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3385, the Honoring 
our Promises through Expedition for 
the Afghan SIVs Act—or the HOPE for 
Afghan SIVs Act—proposes a small, 
but impactful, change to expedite the 
issuance of special immigrant visas to 
those who served side by side with 
American troops in Afghanistan, and 
whose lives are at risk as a result. 
The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa 
program allows individuals who worked 
for or on behalf of the United States

H3221 
June 28, 2021 
Government or for the NATO Inter-
national Security Assistance Force in 
support of the American mission to 
seek lawful permanent residence to the 
United States. To qualify, applicants 
must meet specific eligibility criteria 
and pass rigorous background checks; a 
process that, on average, takes 3 years. 
Additionally, every applicant who is 
found to be eligible for a visa must 
complete a medical examination before 
they are approved to come to the 
United States. However, in the capital 
city of Kabul, there is only one clinic 
certified by the United States Govern-
ment to provide these mandatory ex-
aminations. 
The already high demand for services 
was worsened by the deteriorating se-
curity conditions and a new outbreak 
of an intense third wave of COVID–19. 
It is now nearly impossible for appli-
cants to schedule this mandatory life- 
changing appointment while in Afghan-
istan. 
The HOPE for Afghan SIVs Act would 
allow the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to 
quickly respond to these emergency 
conditions in Afghanistan by author-
izing a blanket waiver of the medical 
examination requirement for people 
who are otherwise eligible for special 
immigrant visas. 
Once safely in the United States and 
removed from the threat of violence, 
those eligible people must complete 
the 
required 
medical 
examination 
within 30 days. To ensure compliance, 
Afghan special immigrants would be 
admitted to the United States as law-
ful permanent residents on a condi-
tional basis. Conditions would be re-
moved only when the Secretary of 
Homeland Security confirms that the 
examination has been completed and 
the individual is not inadmissible to 
the United States on health-related 
grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Mr. 
CROW of Colorado, and I thank him for 
championing this issue and working 
across the aisle to build consensus and 
awareness for the importance of this 
legislation. I also thank Ranking Mem-
ber JORDAN for his collaboration and 
support in the drafting process. 
As we draw down our military pres-
ence in Afghanistan, many who served 
alongside our troops continue to face 
increasing threats because of their 
service to our country. We must do 
right by these people, and H.R. 3385 is 
an important first step. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1800 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Afghan Allies Pro-
tection Act of 2009 created a special im-
migrant visa, or green card, program 
for Afghan nationals who have worked 
for or on behalf of the United States 
Government for at least a year and 
who have experienced a serious threat 
as a result of this work. The program 
also provides green cards to the spouse 
and children of the Afghan national. 
To date, over 15,500 green cards have 
been issued to principal applicants. Ad-
ditionally, for each principal applicant, 
an average of 3.5 green cards have been 
issued to the spouse and children. 
Section 221(d) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act requires an alien seek-
ing a U.S. green card to undergo a 
physical and mental exam prior to the 
issuance of the green card. Any com-
municable diseases found during the 
exam must be treated before the alien 
is allowed to come to the U.S. This rea-
sonable requirement helps to ensure 
that aliens do not introduce commu-
nicable diseases into the U.S. popu-
lation once in the country. 
H.R. 3385, the HOPE for Afghan SIVs 
Act of 2021, allows the Secretaries of 
Homeland Security and State to waive 
the medical exam requirement until 
after the Afghan SIV holder is admit-
ted to the U.S. Proponents of the bill 
believe 
that 
the 
waiver 
authority 
granted by the bill will speed the pace 
of processing for some of the Afghan 
population seeking green cards. 
Timing is important because, earlier 
this year, President Biden announced 
that American troops would withdraw 
from Afghanistan by September 11, 
2021. The Taliban continues to fight 
and take over districts in Afghanistan. 
There is concern that the lives of the 
Afghan nationals who work for the U.S. 
Government, and their families, are in 
danger because the Taliban intends to 
kill them. 
Many in Congress would like to see 
all 18,000-plus remaining Afghan na-
tionals and their families who are at 
some point in the SIV process imme-
diately brought to the U.S. However, 
there is no way to adequately conduct 
the necessary background checks and 
to otherwise process that many green 
card applications in such a short time-
frame. 
As sympathetic as we are to this pop-
ulation and this situation, we should 
not abdicate our duty to thoroughly 
vet potential green card recipients. 
H.R. 3385 is a measured response to the 
chaotic situation surrounding the Af-
ghan SIV program. 
This bill is yet another piece of legis-
lation that has skipped the committee 
markup process this Congress. Had this 
bill gone through regular order, we 
would have been able to discuss con-
cerns and make potential changes. 
That said, late last week, Judiciary 
Committee Republicans worked with 
Mr. CROW and Mr. WENSTRUP, as well as 
Chairman NADLER, to address some 
concerns. 
For instance, the sponsors agreed to 
reduce the 90-day window after admis-
sion for the alien to complete the med-
ical exam to 30 days. During a global 
pandemic and outbreaks of other seri-
ous communicable diseases in Afghani-
stan, the shorter time period is more 
prudent. 
In addition, the introduced text con-
tained no mechanism to help ensure 
that the alien actually gets the med-
ical exam. The bill sponsors agreed to 
include such a mechanism. The suspen-
sion text makes clear that a green card 
issued to the beneficiary of a medical 
exam waiver is a conditional green 
card, which means the alien should not 
be able to naturalize without having 
completed the requisite medical exam. 
The bill’s sponsors also agreed to add 
a requirement that the administration 
report to Congress on the number of 
Afghan SIV holders who do not comply 
with the medical exam requirement. 
Even under the improved suspension 
text, U.S. taxpayers may bear the cost 
of the medical exams and any requisite 
treatment for illnesses discovered. Cur-
rently, the alien bears the cost of med-
ical exams prior to admission to the 
United States. However, once in the 
country, they are entitled to public 
benefits, including Medicaid. That said, 
the text we are considering today is a 
better alternative to the introduced 
version. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts 
of the bill sponsors and the chairman 
to address these concerns, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, the Army 
Ranger Creed reads, in part: ‘‘I will 
never leave a fallen comrade to fall 
into the hands of the enemy.’’ 
Today, Afghans who worked for U.S. 
forces are in grave danger. The organi-
zation No One Left Behind, a nonprofit 
that advocates for the relocation of Af-
ghan interpreters to the U.S., says that 
more than 300 translators or their rel-
atives have already been killed since 
2014, but that number only increasing 
every day. 
We cannot allow a slow bureaucracy 
to cost the lives of Afghans who served 
alongside our men and women. 
As an Army Ranger and paratrooper, 
I served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
In both places, I worked very closely 
with Iraqi and Afghan interpreters who 
were absolutely critical to me accom-
plishing my mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not somebody who 
many people in this House would say is 
prone to hyperbole or exaggeration, 
but I can say with confidence that I 
might not be here today speaking to all 
of my colleagues had it not been for 
these men and women who trusted us, 
who fought with us, who died with us, 
shoulder to shoulder. 
They provided this service at great 
risk to themselves and their families, 
and they did so with courage and the 
understanding that we would stand 
with them and provide a safe haven if 
and when necessary. 
Well, my friends and colleagues, that 
time has come. 
Today, we are considering the HOPE 
for Afghan SIVs Act to allow the ad-
ministration to waive the requirement 
that Afghan special immigrant visa ap-
plicants undergo a medical examina-
tion while in Afghanistan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3222 
June 28, 2021 
As my colleagues already pointed 
out, there is currently one facility in 
Kabul that conducts all of these exami-
nations. It is already dangerous and in-
creasingly dangerous to get to that fa-
cility, to work through the backlog, 
and to afford those examinations. 
Under our bill, recipients would be 
required to get a medical examination 
within 30 days of arriving in the United 
States. 
Let me be clear. Nothing in this bill 
would impact the security screening 
and vetting process for these appli-
cants. The National Security Council 
estimates that this change could de-
crease the SIV process by approxi-
mately 1 month per applicant. 
My colleagues, in combat and in a 
war zone, every hour matters. Minutes 
seem like hours, days like weeks. A 
month will save many, many lives. 
We wouldn’t be considering this bill 
on the floor today if it weren’t for a 
broad coalition of supporters. 
To my friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative WENSTRUP, I thank him for 
his partnership. I know how important 
this is to him, too, for personal rea-
sons. 
Mr. Speaker, to the members of the 
Honoring 
Our 
Promises 
Working 
Group, I thank them for their steadfast 
attention to this issue and for their 
support of this bill, Republicans and 
Democrats alike. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader HOYER, 
Chairman NADLER, Chairwoman LOF-
GREN, and her subcommittee staff, Ami 
Shah and Betsy Lawrence, for working 
very late the last couple of weeks to 
make sure we got this deal done. 
The American handshake needs to 
mean something, not just in and of 
itself. But we are strong as a country 
not because we have aircraft carrier 
battle groups, fighters, and tanks. We 
are strong because we have friends. 
And to have friends, we need to be a 
friend. We must stand by our partners. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the HOPE for Af-
ghan SIVs Act. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in very strong support of H.R. 
3385, the HOPE for Afghan SIVs Act, 
which the gentleman from Colorado 
and I introduced to help knock down 
one small barrier to getting our Afghan 
friends and allies out of harm’s way, 
which they greatly deserve. 
I truly appreciate the words ex-
pressed by my colleague because they 
reflect so many of my same feelings. 
The bill is not a permanent solution 
to fixing our special immigrant visa 
program, but it is a critical temporary 
waiver to help cut down on the backlog 
of pending Afghan SIV applications. 
During a time of great emergency, it 
is a life and death situation, without a 
doubt. 
There is currently only one facility 
in Afghanistan that performs the re-
quired 
medical 
exams, 
located 
in 
Kabul. Because exams are only valid 
for a few months, many applicants 
must make repeated trips to Kabul at 
their own cost and risk. 
H.R. 3385 would allow the Secretary 
of State and the DHS Secretary to 
jointly issue a 1-year waiver for the in- 
country medical exam requirement, up 
to 3 years. But, importantly, the bill 
requires, to the greatest extent prac-
tical, that the applicant undergoes the 
medical exam no later than 30 days 
after being admitted to the United 
States. 
It explicitly states that nothing in 
the bill prohibits our agencies from 
adopting appropriate measures to pre-
vent the spread of disease here. All it 
does is allow the applicant to undergo 
the medical exam here instead of in 
Kabul. 
During my tour in Iraq, I worked 
alongside Iraqi interpreters who risked 
their lives to serve with us and help us 
complete our mission. Many eventually 
used a similar program to escape 
harm’s way and to build a life in the 
United States. The two that I worked 
with and supported are now full U.S. 
citizens here in America. One is a car-
diologist, and the other has a family 
practice. 
As we withdraw from Afghanistan, 
the Afghans who served by our sides, 
the translators, the contractors, and 
the guides, without whom we could not 
do our jobs, are left in the crosshairs of 
the Taliban. They worked for the 
United States, despite knowing the 
risk to their own lives and their fami-
lies. They believed in us, and they be-
lieved in our cause. 
It will be a black eye on the United 
States if we don’t do everything in our 
power to protect these allies. If we 
don’t honor our promises, if we allow 
our friends to be targeted and killed by 
groups like the Taliban, ISIS, and al- 
Qaida because they worked with and 
for the United States of America, we 
will send a message to those we will 
need to rely on in the future that we 
are unable to live up to our side of the 
bargain. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his tireless work in bringing this 
issue to the forefront as we withdraw 
from Afghanistan, for all the staff that 
put in so much time to get this done, 
and for our bipartisan Honoring Our 
Promises Working Group for keeping 
the pressure on the administration to 
make sure that we don’t leave our al-
lies behind. 
Mr. Speaker, please support this bill. 
It is a good thing for America to do. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CROW
for his service, his powerful 
words, and his commitment. I thank 
Representative WENSTRUP, too, for his 
powerful words. 
Our Afghan allies serve alongside 
U.S. troops, diplomats, and govern-
ment employees. We must do right by 
the people who have worked to protect 
our country and our servicemen and 
-women. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port them through the HOPE for Af-
ghan SIVs Act. I support this impor-
tant legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

Speaker, I have a parliamentary in-
quiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. ROY. Is it still a requirement 
that you have to make a case that it is 
a virus or COVID-related reason for 
voting by proxy? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is free to go ahead and review 
the proxy voting regulations issued 
pursuant to section 3(s) of House Reso-
lution 8. 
b 1942 
So (two-thirds being in the affirma-

The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am un-
able to vote today because I am attending the

NATIONAL GUARD ENDING 
MISSION AT FOOD BANKS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong appreciation of our 
Ohio National Guardsmen, who have 
valiantly served Ohio’s food banks dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. As their 
mission closes this Friday, let us com-
mend the women and men in uniform 
whose selfless duty helped meet un-
precedented need. 
Ohio’s food banks served up to 150,000 
more Ohioans monthly during this pan-
demic and saw 3 in 10 people seeking 
out emergency food assistance for the 
first time. 
With the food banks’ core volunteer 
force sidelined, the Ohio National 
Guard deployed over 400 members to 
help meet the human challenge. These 
women and men are owed a significant 
debt of gratitude. 
Let us offer our deepest thanks to 
the Ohio National Guard adjutant gen-
eral, Major General John Harris, whose 
leadership and swift organization im-
plemented the Guard’s mission with 
great precision. 
I thank the Ohio Association of 
Foodbanks executive director, Lisa 
Hamler-Fugitt; the Toledo SeaGate ex-
ecutive director, Mindy Rapp; the To-
ledo Food Bank president and CEO, 
James Caldwell; the Second Harvest of 
North Central Ohio president and CEO, 
Julie Chase-Morefield; and the Greater 
Cleveland Food Bank president and 
CEO, Kristin Warzocha. 
These tireless teams put a human 
face on America. Congratulations to 
them all.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Hyde amendment and to denounce 
President Biden’s pro-abortion budget. 
Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has 
saved millions of innocent lives by en-
suring that American tax dollars are 
not spent on abortions. For over 40 
years, Congress has supported the Hyde 
amendment with bipartisan support. 
That tradition seems to have ended 
with this current administration as 
President Biden hopes to pass the most 
pro-abortion budget in our Nation’s 
history. 
As a healthcare professional, father, 
and grandfather, I strongly believe in 
the right to life, just like the majority 
of Americans. We must stand up for 
those who cannot stand up for them-
selves and uphold these provisions set 
by Congress over 40 years ago to save 
the lives of the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under guidelines 
consistently 
issued 
by 
successive 
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of 
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair 
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the 
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the importance of H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act. 
For more than 40 years, in a bipar-
tisan fashion, Congress has passed the 
Hyde amendment, a provision ensuring 
Americans are not forced to pay for 
abortion on demand with their tax dol-
lars. 
This year, the Hyde amendment is 
under attack. I believe in the sanctity 
of life, which is why I am a proud origi-
nal cosponsor of H.R. 18. 
H.R. 18 would make the Hyde amend-
ment permanent and governmentwide, 
providing additional protection to the 
unborn. 
It was written in our Declaration of 
Independence that we all have a right 
to life. As a Member of Congress, I in-
tend to uphold this. 
Madam Speaker, in that spirit, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
AMERICAN LEGION BOYS NATION 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, recently, 
two high school members of the Shelby 
American Legion Post 82 were selected 
as participants for the Boys Nation 
program in Washington. This is the 
first time that the Shelby American 
Legion Post 82 has ever had two can-
didates selected to participate in this 
prestigious educational program. 
Robert Stockham of Pinnacle Clas-
sical Academy and Zachary Morrow of 
Burns High School will spend 1 week in 
Washington learning about the struc-
ture and function of the Federal Gov-
ernment. This opportunity, through 
The American Legion, is important, 
and I am confident these two young 
men will make the most of this experi-
ence. 
Congratulations to both Zachary and 
Robert on this significant accomplish-
ment.

FOUNDING DOCUMENTS IN 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, re-
cently, the National Archives released 
a report in which they concluded a 
structural nature of racism permeates 
all aspects of work and workplace cul-
ture at the National Archives. Unbe-
lievable. 
Among other things, they claim that 
the rotunda where our founding docu-
ments—the Declaration of Independ-
ence, the Constitution, and the Bill of 
Rights—are housed are displayed as an 
example of structural racism. Also, 
they called out the praise of our 
Founders that constructed those docu-
ments as being somehow triggering of 
people. 
The report recommends that we re-
imagine—a buzzword, these days—the 
rotunda at the National Archives, in-
cluding staging dance and performance 
art in the space that invites dialogue 
about the ways the United States has 
mythologized the Founding era. 
So rather than celebrating our inde-
pendence, like we will in a few days, we 
will be focused on the U.S. failures or 
flaws. It seems we have enough bashing 
of our country, our flag, even our Na-
tional Anthem, as we saw at a track 
and field event of a would-be Olympian 
who turned away from our anthem. 
The report also calls for putting in 
place trigger warnings for those who 
would view and see the display there. 
We are losing our minds, folks. These 
are our founding documents. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with an opportunity for this 
body and the United States Congress to 
save lives. 
The Hyde amendment has been an es-
sential safeguard that has defended the 
unborn and protected millions of lives 
for more than 40 years. A recent esti-
mate credits the Hyde amendment with 
saving more than 2.4 million precious 
and innocent lives. 
Historically, measures which prevent 
taxpayer dollars from being used to 
perform 
abortions 
have 
garnered 
strong bipartisan support. In fact, 
President Biden was a vocal supporter 
of the Hyde amendment during his dec-
ades of service in the U.S. Senate. 
However, it is clear that Democrats 
in Washington have changed their 
mind, as they have recently made it 
their mission to eliminate these long-
standing protections and force families 
in west Michigan and across the Nation 
to violate their deeply held beliefs by 
funding abortions on demand with 
their hard-earned tax dollars. 
I believe, as millions of Michiganders 
and those across America believe, we 
must embrace a culture that protects 
the values of life. Using taxpayer dol-
lars to end the lives of innocent chil-
dren is wrong. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

RECOGNIZING LEWIS CHITENGWA 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, in Decem-
ber 1992, my friend, Lewis Chitengwa, 
defeated Tiger Woods in a tournament 
called the Orange Bowl in Florida. 
A 
year 
later, 
my 
friend, 
Lewis 
Chitengwa, was denied entrance and 
asked to go into the back where the 
caddies go in when he went to the 
South African Amateur Championship. 
He went on to win that tournament, 
becoming the first Black man to win 
the South African Amateur. 
Unfortunately, 20 years ago this 
Wednesday, 
my 
friend, 
Lewis, 
my 
brother in Christ, my teammate at the 
University of Virginia, went to see the 
Lord when he passed away from viral 
meningitis. 
My teammates will be regaling his 
life this Wednesday. I am going to take 
to the floor for a Special Order in July 
to talk more about this man, who was 
ultimately inducted into the Hall of 
Fame in South Africa with a speech 
from the famous Gary Player.

DEFENDING RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today in hosting a Special 
Order on the Second Amendment, 
which is both near and dear to my 
heart and which is also near and dear 
to the many millions of Americans who 
cherish their rights and freedoms. 
The Second Amendment says: ‘‘A 
well regulated militia, being necessary 
to the security of a free state, the right 
of the people to keep and bear arms, 
shall not be infringed.’’ 
Though it brings me great joy to talk 
at length about the Second Amend-
ment and the foresight our Founding 
Fathers had to enshrine this God-given 
right into the U.S. Constitution, I re-
gret that lawmakers today must still 
rise to defend it, a matter that was set-
tled 230 years ago. 
We must still do this because the 
Second Amendment is, again, under di-
rect and constant attack from not just 
gun control activist groups and the 
left, but now from our very own gov-
ernment within the executive branch. 
The Founding Fathers enumerated 
our right to keep and bear arms in the 
Bill of Rights to ensure the people had 
the ability to protect themselves from 
a treacherous government that sought 
tyranny over democracy. 
We know, Madam Speaker, and our 
Founding Fathers knew as well, that 
the first step toward tyranny is to dis-
arm the citizenry. 
The irony is not lost on me that the 
Democrats in control today are trying 
to do everything they can to gain 
power and keep power through rule 
changes and enacting sweeping laws 
that will forever tilt the scales of that 
power in their favor. 
b 2000 
It was announced just this past week 
that Republicans and Democrats were 
able to strike a deal on an infrastruc-
ture plan which was heralded as great 
news and no easy feat in this partisan 
body. But then the news broke that the 
Democrats wanted to add to the bipar-
tisan agreement a vast human infra-
structure proposal. What is human in-
frastructure? 
So now infrastructure becomes rede-
fined to be anything they want it to be. 
So if you cannot get something done 
legitimately via legislation because 
you don’t have the votes, then the new 
tactic is to accomplish it by redefini-
tion. Just redefine the meaning of the 
word. So when does this act of rede-
fining everything as we know it stop? 
Madam Speaker, I fear that it won’t, 
and I see that to be true when it comes 
to attacks on the Second Amendment, 
as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
Firearms’ newly proposed rules on the 
definition of a frame or receiver and on 
pistol stabilizing braces makes that 
abundantly clear. Through these pro-
posed regulations, the administration 
is attempting to unilaterally redefine 
what constitutes a firearm under Fed-
eral law and in doing so, restrict the 
rights of law-abiding gun owners. 
In some cases, the courts have not 
ruled in ATF’s way, so ATF wants to 
change the rules, so the courts have to

abide by new regulations more favor-
able to them. The ATF wants to in-
crease their influence and authority 
and do it by edict, making it harder on 
law-abiding citizens to own firearms. 
They want a new definition for a fire-
arm, one that will greatly expand its 
meaning and give ATF immense addi-
tional authority. 
It was Congress who created the law 
that defines a firearm. ATF does not 
have that authority. We have a separa-
tion of powers issue here that ATF 
wants to ignore. It seems they don’t 
want the representatives of the people 
to have a say. No, ATF wants to make 
the change themselves and thereby in-
crease their own power. This is wrong 
thinking and it is dangerous. 
Before I go further, let me pause for 
a second and review the legislative his-
tory of our key gun laws. 
Congress passed the National Fire-
arms Act, or NFA, in 1934; the Gun 
Control Act, or GCA, in 1968; and the 
Firearms Owners’ Protection Act in 
1986. While two of these acts have since 
been amended, with the GCA amending 
portions of the NFA, the current defi-
nition of the term ‘‘firearm’’ can be 
found in the GCA under 18 U.S.C. 921 
and has been effectively used for over 
50 years. 
But the ATF has decided to expand 
its authority by proposing broad and 
arbitrary definitions of industry terms 
including some that are not even ref-
erenced in the definition section of the 
current law, including the terms, ‘‘pri-
vately made firearm,’’ and ‘‘complete 
weapon.’’ 
It is one thing for an agency to use 
its regulatory authority to clarify 
terms included in statute for purposes 
of implementation, but it is clear to 
me that the AFT has overstepped its 
authorities by legislating new terms 
not even referenced in the statute. 
Under one of the proposed new regu-
lations, a dummy receiver or an 80 per-
cent lower would now be considered a 
firearm as it would be covered by the 
grossly expanded definition of a frame 
or receiver. 
As you can see in the illustration 
right here, you see the difference be-
tween the two. The top is actually 
functional. The other one on the bot-
tom is a solid block of metal with no 
ability to accept a firing mechanism, 
no hammer, no trigger, no selector. 
And so it is completely nonfunctional. 
Now, let’s look at those same two 
from the top-down view. Do you see the 
difference right here? The bottom one 
is a solid block of metal, but the top 
has been machined and has places for a 
trigger and a hammer and a selector. 
To make the bottom one work, you 
have to have the tools and the skill of 
a manufacturer. 
So let’s take a closer look at the 
dummy 
receiver, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
right here. This solid block of metal 
doesn’t look like a firearm to me and it 
certainly doesn’t work like one either. 
There is not even a hole right down 
here for a trigger. The ATF, in its own 
rule, noted that Congress recognized 
that regulation of all firearm parts was 
impractical back when this body was 
debating the GCA in 1968. 
And in fact, Congress moved to make 
the regulation of the firearms industry 
more efficient and functional by strik-
ing language in the term ‘‘firearm,’’ 
that would have resulted in regulation 
of any part or parts of a firearm. Just 
like the bolt in the upper receiver as-
sembly pictured right here, they are 
not firearms now. But ATF wants to 
make this a firearm. 
But there is another aspect of this re-
definition that will go completely un-
noticed unless it is challenged, and 
that is taxation. The more pieces and 
parts the ATF can call firearms, the 
more excise tax they can collect. Let 
that sink in for a minute. Yes, this is 
another tax hidden in the price of a 
firearm. 
Every firearm manufacturer pays a 
10 or 11 percent excise tax to the ATF 
based on the invoice price when they 
sell a firearm to a dealer. So through 
this redefinition, the government is 
going to make more tax money on the 
backs of law-abiding citizens. And will 
Congress have passed a new law to in-
crease taxes? No. The ATF will have 
created a new stream of tax revenue by 
simply changing the definition of a 
firearm frame or receiver. More tax-
ation at the whim of ATF. 
The Second Amendment recognizes 
the right endowed by our creator and 
codifies it into law. Taxation of a con-
stitutional right is unconstitutional. 
But if this redefinition is allowed to 
stand, then this will only be the begin-
ning of more and more taxation on citi-
zens’ gun rights. ATF knows that they 
cannot make the law more stringent 
without action by Congress, and they 
know that such support does not exist 
in Congress. So they try a flanking ma-
neuver and end run to bypass the legis-
lative branch. 
They believe that they, along with 
gun 
control 
activists 
like 
David 
Chipman, can use the authority of the 
ATF, a law enforcement agency, as a 
political pawn to carry out their anti- 
Second Amendment agenda. 
Madam Speaker, that is exactly what 
the ATF is doing, as we speak. One day 
you have a perfectly legal firearm or 
part, the next day you wake up and 
your firearm is no longer legal as de-
fined by ATF. Such legality must be 
left to Congress to decide as it has done 
through the legislation I previously 
referenced; not decided by unelected 
Federal bureaucrats, bureaucrats that 
may soon be led by a radical gun con-
trol activist named David Chipman, 
unless my colleagues in the Senate op-
pose his nomination, and I trust they 
will. 
I fear, Madam Speaker, that if my 
Senate counterparts do not thwart his 
nomination, we will have more rede-
fining of words led by a partisan, rad-
ical gun control activist. I call it legis-
lation by redefinition. 
But this abuse of power can be 
stopped, Madam Speaker, and I invite 
you to join me in defending our rights 
by submitting comments directly to 
the ATF through the Federal Register 
notice. The two proposed rules I have 
referenced so far are available online 
for the public to read and have collec-
tively received more than 180,000 com-
ments so far. 
One rule is called, ‘‘Definition of 
‘Frame or Receiver’ and Identification 
of Firearms.’’ The other rule is called, 
‘‘Factoring Criteria for Firearms with 
Attached ‘Stabilizing Braces’.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I believe all Ameri-
cans, especially gun owners, should in-
form 
themselves 
of 
the 
proposed 
changes and share their thoughts di-
rectly with the ATF through the public 
comment 
opportunity 
at 
www.regulations.gov. 
It 
is 
written 
right here. 
The public comment period will last 
for just a few more weeks, and I would 
love to see the total number of sub-
mitted comments hit half a million for 
each proposed rule. I think every single 
member of this body agrees with my 
belief that criminals who misuse fire-
arms and perpetuate violent crimes 
should be held accountable for their ac-
tions. And I also hope my colleagues 
would concur with my belief that law- 
abiding firearm owners should not be 
punished because of the illegal acts of 
a few who knowingly commit evil acts. 
But rather than focusing their efforts 
on punishing criminals who use fire-
arms in the commission of a crime, my 
Democratic colleagues have, instead, 
chosen again and again to slowly chip 
away at the Second Amendment rights 
of law-abiding citizens. 
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 are prime exam-
ples of Democrat-led efforts to curtail 
Americans’ Second Amendment rights. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 1787, the 
Ensuring SAFETY Act which would 
mandate the Federal Government re-
spond to a background check in three 
calendar days and not allow them to 
delay background checks potentially 
indefinitely as happened during the 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to 
have so many of my colleagues join me 
in standing before you today to speak 
in defense of the Constitution and the 
Second Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUD-
SON), our conference secretary, from 
the Eighth Congressional District. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise, 
a proud defender of our rights as guar-
anteed in the Second Amendment. 
Ever since I was a little boy, my 
grandfather taught me the right way 
to handle a gun. I have loved the out-
doors and appreciate the freedom that 
comes from our Second Amendment. 
As an adult, I came to understand the 
Second Amendment is the right that 
allows us to defend all of our other 
rights. Unfortunately, the Biden ad-
ministration has declared war on the 
Second Amendment. In just the past 6 
months, the President and my col-
leagues across the aisle have pushed

numerous gun control policies that 
would have zero impact on violence but 
threaten law-abiding citizens. 
The most recent example is a pro-
posed rule from the ATF to impose a 
new tax and ban on stabilizing braces. 
This proposed regulation jeopardizes 
the right of law-abiding gun owners, in-
cluding disabled combat veterans who 
rely on these braces. In fact, these 
braces were invented to assist disabled 
veterans. 
Should this rule go into effect, a dis-
abled veteran who has chosen the best 
brace for their disability is now break-
ing the law unless they turn in or de-
stroy the firearm, destroy the brace, or 
pay a $200 tax. This radical policy 
could make millions of law-abiding 
citizens into felons overnight. 
Recently, I led 140 Members of Con-
gress to call on the ATF to withdraw 
that regulation. Forty-eight Senators 
also joined this effort, and we are 
united in pushing back against this ex-
treme gun control agenda. Moms and 
dads, sons and daughters, and, yes, dis-
abled 
veterans—every 
law-abiding 
American should have the right to pro-
tect themselves and exercise their 
rights as enshrined in our Constitu-
tion. 
That is why I have also been a leader 
on expanding concealed carry reci-
procity across our country. As the au-
thor of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry 
Reciprocity Act, I am working to en-
sure law-abiding concealed carry per-
mit holders do not become criminals 
when they cross an invisible State line. 
It is common sense. Due, in part, to 
rising crime sweeping our Nation, legal 
gun ownership has reached record 
highs, making H.R. 38 needed now more 
than ever. These millions of Americans 
looking to defend themselves and their 
families deserve to have their rights 
respected and protected. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with my col-
leagues who say we must do more to 
protect our schools and our commu-
nities, but the answer is never taking 
guns away from law-abiding citizens. It 
is supporting good police officers, hard-
ening our schools, building on the 
STOP School Violence Act, and invest-
ing in mental healthcare. These are all 
accomplishments of the last Repub-
lican House majority. 
I hope my colleagues across the aisle 
will work with me to build on these so-
lutions which should be overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan. Together, we can 
make real change without dismantling 
the Second Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive ANDREW CLYDE for his leadership 
on defending our Second Amendment, 
and for hosting this excellent Special 
Order tonight. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I com-
mend my colleague from North Caro-
lina (Mr. HUDSON) for introducing the 
Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill 
that I am proud to support as a cospon-
sor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. NEHLS), my 
good friend from Texas’ 22. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, crime 
is rising across the country. Double- 
digit increases in violent crime have 
been seen in cities across our country; 
liberal cities, no less, that chose to 
defund their police. This shouldn’t be a 
surprise to anyone here. When you 
defund the police, you have less police. 
And less police means more criminals 
on the streets. 
Rather than address the poor policy 
decisions that have led to this increase 
in violent crime, like defunding police, 
Democrats are attempting to deflect 
blame on to gun owners. Law-abiding 
gun owners in this country are fre-
quently attacked by the radical left as 
being the source of the gun violence 
problem. The left wants to tell them 
what guns they can own and how they 
should be able to purchase them. 
As a former county sheriff, I know 
firsthand how important gun owner-
ship is. When someone lives in a re-
mote part of the country, they can’t af-
ford to wait for a 20-minute law en-
forcement response time in the event 
of a home invasion. That person needs 
quick access to a firearm to defend 
themselves and their loved ones. And 
that is exactly what legal gun owner-
ship is about, defending one’s liberty 
from would-be attackers. 
Law-abiding gun owners are not the 
source of the problem with gun crimes 
across the country. It is criminals who 
have no regard for the law. Taking 
away or limiting a law-abiding citi-
zen’s access to legally purchasing a 
firearm will only hurt law-abiding citi-
zens. We must protect the Second 
Amendment rights of all Americans. It 
is a foundational right of our Republic 
and must not be infringed. 
Republicans in the House must stand 
firm as the radical left continues their 
assault. If we lose the Second Amend-
ment, all others will be in jeopardy. 
‘‘Shall not be infringed.’’ It is that sim-
ple. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative NEHLS
for his com-
ments. He is truly a staunch supporter 
of law enforcement, as am I. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
from my home State, who represents 
Georgia’s First District. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to show 
my support for the Second Amendment 
and draw attention to its importance. I 
would like to start by emphasizing a 
line from the Second Amendment. ‘‘ 
. . . the right of the people to keep and 
bear arms shall not be infringed.’’ 
Let me repeat that: ‘‘ . . . shall not 
be infringed.’’ I emphasize this point 
because today there are many efforts 
to infringe and abridge this essential 
right. There are a lot of misconcep-
tions surrounding the Second Amend-
ment, but let me make it clear, the 
Second Amendment enshrines the right 
to self-protection in defense of liberty 
for all Americans. 
The right to protect yourself is not 
given to us by our government. As part 
of the Bill of Rights, the Second 
Amendment was not intended to com-
prehensively define the scope of our 
right to bear arms. Rather, it serves as 
a prohibition on certain actions our 
government can take to infringe on 
that right 
b 2015 
The Biden administration, however, 
misunderstands this point. In a state-
ment last week, the White House stat-
ed that the Second Amendment limits 
the type of people who could own a 
gun. Further, it continues to seek to 
restrain Americans’ rights through 
other actions. 
A recent example is the administra-
tion’s move to strictly regulate stabi-
lizing braces that have allowed dis-
abled individuals to more easily enjoy 
their constitutionally protected right. 
Americans bought 15.1 million guns 
during the 7-month period from March 
through September of 2020, which was a 
91 percent leap from the same period in 
2019. The FBI also processed more 
background checks for gun purchases 
in just the first 9 months of 2020 than 
it had for any previous full year. 
Americans want to be safer, and guns 
give them that sense of security. In 
spite of that fact, my colleagues across 
the aisle have made it their mission to 
restrict this liberty in the name of 
safety. 
However, there is no link between 
the number of guns and gun violence in 
the U.S. The number of guns in Amer-
ica rose nearly 50 percent between 1993 
and 2013. During the same period, gun 
homicides fell by nearly 50 percent. 
In fact, violent crime has been de-
creasing for decades, despite an in-
crease last year, during which we also 
saw calls for defunding the police. In 
2019, the violent crime rate fell to the 
second lowest total rate since 1971, and 
the murder rate was less than half of 
what it was at the 1980 peak. 
Restricting the Second Amendment 
is simply not the answer. This right, 
preserved in our Constitution genera-
tions ago, cannot be taken away from 
ourselves and future generations. We 
must protect from intrusions on our 
right to protect ourselves, no matter 
how hard the left works to strip us of 
this principle. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in standing up for 
our Second Amendment right to bear 
arms. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative CARTER for his inspir-
ing words. 
Madam Speaker, I ask this: If we 
grant an 18-year-old individual the 
right to cast a vote, which decides the 
fate of our Nation, and can ask them to 
serve in our Armed Forces, should we 
not also grant that individual the right 
to keep and bear arms, which is grant-
ed by the Constitution? 
I am proud to support a bill intro-
duced by my friend from Kentucky, Mr.

MASSIE, which would restore Second 
Amendment rights to individuals of 
voting age. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the good 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Georgia, 
and I appreciate his unwavering sup-
port for the Second Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today because, 
just last week, our President of this 
country spoke about using the nuclear 
option. He wasn’t talking about get-
ting rid of the 60-vote rule in the Sen-
ate. He was actually contemplating a 
nuclear conflagration with the citizens 
of this country, with the patriots of 
this country. He said they should get 
F–15s and nuclear weapons if they 
wanted to keep this government in 
check. 
Those aren’t the words of George 
Washington. Those would be the words 
of King George. 
Imagine if a dictator—just imagine 
the dictator of North Korea or the des-
pot who runs Iran had muttered or 
stuttered or uttered these words like 
our President would and did. There 
would be an international outcry today 
to have that dictator removed. 
We need to hold our chief executive 
accountable for these words. And our 
chief executive of this country would 
do well to understand what the Second 
Amendment is really about. It is about 
keeping an overzealous executive in 
check. It is about securing all of the 
other liberties in this constitution. It 
is about the patriots who are willing to 
tell the government: We are in charge. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative MASSIE for those inspir-
ing words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the good 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Georgia for his 
conviction and his dedication to this 
issue and getting us this opportunity 
for all of us to share that. 
I appreciate the remarks from my 
friend, the gentleman from Kentucky. I 
couldn’t agree more about how offen-
sive what we heard from the President 
of the United States with respect to 
our 
Second 
Amendment 
protected 
rights; and then coming in and talking 
about the foolishness of our desire to 
have our Second Amendment rights 
protected when, in fact, we would be up 
against F–15s and potential nuclear 
weapons. 
Imagine the absurdity of having the 
President of the United States say 
that. 
Meanwhile, I live in Austin, Texas, 
where currently crime rates are sky-
rocketing. Murder rates almost double. 
Why might that be? 
The President of the United States 
gave a speech allegedly about crime. 
Did he talk about the defunding of 
police? Did he talk about the $150 mil-
lion stripped out of the budget in Aus-
tin, Texas? 
How about Oakland right now, dou-
bling down on their foolish defunding 
of the police? 
It wasn’t enough to take $15 million 
out of it last time, and now seeing 
murder rates skyrocket. They are now 
doubling down for another $16 million. 
They think that is going to solve their 
problems. 
The genius of the current administra-
tion, my Democrats on the other side 
of the aisle, is to take police off the 
streets and then come after our Second 
Amendment rights. 
How about the border of Texas? 
The border of Texas is wide open with 
cartels operating fully from the Gulf of 
Mexico all the way up through Big 
Bend. They have operational control of 
our border. We have images of gunmen 
coming across the Rio Grande. We have 
humans being sold into sex trafficking 
and human trafficking. We have 7,500 
pounds of fentanyl pouring across our 
border; Americans dying in this opioid 
epidemic. We have Americans in dan-
ger. 
And what do Democrats want to do? 
Take away our Second Amendment 
rights to defend ourselves as they 
defund police and empower cartels. 
That is your Democratic Party, la-
dies and gentlemen. They want you to 
be in danger. They want you to have to 
suffer the consequences of their rote 
incompetence and disbelief in your 
ability to take care of your own fami-
lies and your communities. 
The President of the United States 
actually said the other day that, in 
fact, you are not allowed to have a can-
non. 
Well, you know what? 
In Texas, there was a moment when 
we had a cannon and we looked at the 
Mexicans and we said: Come and take 
it, in 1835. 
And that is what I say to the Presi-
dent of the United States: Come and 
take it, because it is our Second 
Amendment rights and we are going to 
defend ourselves. 
And when he asks why we need 20 
rounds of ammo, maybe it is because 
he is saying that he wants to come 
after the American people with F–15s 
and nuclear weapons. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas 21 for his 
passionate 
defense 
of 
our 
Second 
Amendment rights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would just say 
this: Number one, I think you would do 
well to turn off the phone and pay at-
tention to this Special Order while you 
have the honor of presiding over the 
floor of the House of Representatives. 
The words being spoken are important 
here. 
I would just share a brief anecdote 
with you, and it is this: I have spent 
many nights in combat. And like many 
of my friends, helmet, night-vision op-
tics, lots of Velcro camo, backpack. I 
was a bomb technician, so I normally 
carried 30, 40 pounds of explosives. I 
had my side arm. I had my carbine. I 
had a metal detector and a number of 
other things. I normally had about 10 
magazines across the front of my vest. 
And we were heavy. We were carrying a 
lot of weight on any given night. And 
every single night, both myself and my 
brothers in arms would decide how 
many more magazines we were going to 
put into our backpacks, into our kits, 
because we always felt that the dumb-
est reason for any of us to die would be 
for a lack of shooting back. 
And I think that is something that 
would, in turn, be one of the dumbest 
reasons for any law-abiding American 
to bring about their death, would be 
because they can’t shoot back. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
for 
those 
inspiring 
words. As a fellow combat veteran, I 
honor his service and I honor his 
speech this evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
TENNEY), who sent out an amicus brief, 
and I was proud to cosponsor that brief. 
I thank her for defending our Second 
Amendment in that brief. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for hosting this 
great Special Order on a fundamental 
right. 
Madam Speaker, our Second Amend-
ment right to keep and bear arms for 
self-protection is a fundamental right 
protected by the Constitution and the 
Bill of Rights. 
However, many States, including my 
own home State of New York, home to 
Remington Arms, of all places, uncon-
stitutionally restricts our right to 
carry concealed outside of our home. In 
most New York jurisdictions, an appli-
cant must justify their need for such a 
concealed carry permit. 
Despite the plain words of the Second 
Amendment enshrined for centuries in 
the Bill of Rights, State and local au-
thorities in New York continue to re-
ject applications for law-abiding Amer-
icans for entirely arbitrary reasons or 
for no reason at all. States like Cali-
fornia and Massachusetts do exactly 
the same thing. 
This arbitrary standard must be re-
jected. That is why I am leading the 
amicus brief for an upcoming U.S. Su-
preme Court, New York State Rifle and 
Pistol Association v. Corlett. This case 
will decide if New York’s burdensome 
concealed carry law violates the Sec-
ond Amendment. 
A little background on the case: In 
2016, Rensselaer County, New York, of-
ficials denied the concealed carry per-
mit of Robert Nash for the purpose of 
self-defense. Later, in 2018, they also 
denied the concealed carry application 
of Brandon Koch for the same reason. 
Both these individuals are honorable, 
upstanding, and law-abiding citizens. 
They met every requirement of New 
York’s rigorous concealed carry license 
application. These two men simply ap-
plied for a concealed carry permit for 
personal protection after a rash of rob-
beries in their neighborhoods and their 
community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3230 
June 28, 2021 
New York State is now witnessing 
the highest crime rate that we have 
had in the history of our State. How-
ever, even after all of that, the county 
licensing officers did not believe that 
self-defense was a valid exercise of con-
stitutional rights under the Second 
Amendment. 
The gun control measures being con-
sidered by the Supreme Court in this 
key case amount to a blanket ban on 
the right to keep and bear arms outside 
the home. The amicus brief I am sub-
mitting, with the support of more than 
50 Members of the House of Representa-
tives so far, defends citizens’ rights 
against elected officials and govern-
ment bureaucrats who are attempting 
to deny these fundamental constitu-
tional rights to all Americans. 
We argue that it is unconstitutional 
for the government to apply a bal-
ancing test for a fundamental right 
such as the Second Amendment under 
our Constitution. The Bill of Rights 
was drafted and passed to protect citi-
zens from government overreach. 
It is worth noting that New York is 
an original colony with a very strong 
history of citizens who stood up for our 
basic rights. In 1788 and 1789, before and 
during the Constitutional Convention 
and the founding of our Federal Con-
stitution, New York’s leaders refused 
to sign on to our Federal Constitution 
until—until—the Bill of Rights was 
added to our founding document. They 
knew how important Second Amend-
ment rights were then, and how impor-
tant they were to a self-governing con-
stitutional Republic such as ours. 
The success of the plaintiff, law-abid-
ing gun owners in this case, will end 
this improper interpretation of our 
constitutional right to keep and bear 
arms, and will be the first major pro- 
Second Amendment decision consid-
ered by the U.S. Supreme Court since 
Heller v. District of Columbia. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
who take their oath to uphold the Con-
stitution seriously to sign on to this 
amicus brief. Together, we can all pro-
tect our Second Amendment rights for 
all Americans. 
I, again, want to thank Mr. CLYDE for 
his tenacious advocacy on behalf of our 
God-given constitutional rights, and 
all of my colleagues here today who are 
standing up for all Americans. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from New York for 
her inspiring words and her work on 
this very important amicus brief. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT), a fiery defender of our Sec-
ond Amendment because she knows ex-
actly what is at stake. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), for putting this 
together. 
Madam Speaker, I want to begin this 
evening by thanking my Democrat col-
leagues for their outstanding work in 
encouraging millions of Americans to 
celebrate their Second Amendment 
rights by purchasing their first, sec-
ond, or even 100th firearm. 
From the last riots in cities across 
America, to Biden’s threat to strip 
away our basic constitutional rights, 
Democrats are singlehandedly respon-
sible for the sale of tens of millions of 
firearms. 
b 2030 
Bravo. Well done. I hear that the in-
terest has begun to peak when it comes 
to the sale of F–15s. 
Now, I have some questions for these 
freedom-haters. When are you going to 
call on the Chief Executive, the base-
ment dweller, to hold his own son ac-
countable for his gun crimes? Hunter 
Biden lied on a Federal firearms appli-
cation, which is punishable by up to 10 
years and a $250,000 fine, of which 10 
percent will not be going to the big 
guy. 
Rules for thee but not for my 
crackhead, 
parmesan-smoking, 
gun 
criminal son? 
What about the disposal of Hunter 
Biden’s gun in a back-ally dumpster? 
Why was the Secret Service involved in 
locating this firearm? Can you just 
imagine, for half a second, if Donald 
Trump, Jr., was involved in firearms 
crimes, and his dad ordered the Secret 
Service to cover it up? 
That is just the start of the hypoc-
risy. Biden will call widely purchased 
firearms ‘‘weapons of war,’’ but then he 
will tell you that you need an F–15 or 
a nuke to keep the Federal Govern-
ment in check. He will target so-called 
‘‘merchants of death’’ but celebrate the 
600 abortion clinics across America. 
This 
regime 
will 
encourage 
riots, 
defund the police, and try to take away 
Americans’ rights to self-defense. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple are not on board with the Biden re-
gime’s hypocritical gun-grabbing. In-
stead, they are buying guns at a record 
rate. So my colleagues from the other 
side, they can keep running their 
mouths, and we will keep adding to our 
arsenals. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado’s 
Third District for her excellent re-
marks and reminding us of the inves-
tigation that needs to be initiated on 
the purchase of a firearm by Hunter 
Biden, a 4473 that was not filled out 
correctly, which is a violation of law. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY), 
representing 
Pennsylvania’s 10th District. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for hosting us 
this evening. 
Every single person here laments the 
crime that is occurring in our country, 
the people that lose their lives to 
crime. Every single one of us laments 
that, especially when it comes to the 
inability to defend yourself or your 
family. It is unacceptable; it is hor-
rific. 
Unfortunately, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, the Democrats, 
want to defund the police and disarm 
America, essentially destroying the 
Constitution. 
Now, they will tell you it is all about 
safety, because they, too, lament these 
lost lives as we do. But ladies and gen-
tlemen, it is not really about safety; it 
is about control. 
Now, there is a country close to us 
that has pretty strict gun control. 
There is one gun store in the country 
to our south, one, where you can buy a 
gun legally. The country is Mexico. 
Their homicide rate is five to six times 
that of the United States. 
Remember, we lament every single 
lost life, especially those where people 
cannot defend themselves. 
But that is what this is about. My 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
want to destroy the Constitution to 
control you. 
Like I said, we lament every single 
lost life. In Mexico, you can barely own 
a firearm legally, with five or six times 
the murder rate. 
What is happening in the United 
States of America? We are defunding 
the police and taking the rights and 
the ability of law-abiding citizens away 
from them to defend themselves in 
these cities: Chicago, New York City, 
Baltimore, 
Los 
Angeles, 
Detroit— 
strictest gun control in America. It is 
actually worse there than it is in Mex-
ico. It is actually worse there, 10 times 
the homicide rate. 
Ladies and gentlemen, do not let the 
Federal Government take your rights 
away. The Constitution says this right 
shall not be infringed upon. 
I come from Pennsylvania, and it 
says the right to defend yourself—the 
right to defend yourself, the right to 
bear arms and defend yourself shall not 
be questioned. We are not going to 
allow it to be questioned here. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from the great State of 
Pennsylvania for reminding us of how 
tremendously important the Second 
Amendment is. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD), my 
good friend and colleague who rep-
resents Virginia’s Fifth District. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, the right to keep and bear arms for 
self-defense and to ensure we remain a 
free people is a God-given right, not a 
government-bestowed privilege. 
We are, however, privileged to live in 
a country whose Founders correctly 
and appropriately recognized this God- 
given right and codified it in the high-
est law of the land, the Constitution. 
The wording of the Second Amend-
ment is assumptive in nature. The 
right to keep and bear arms is assumed 
to already exist, and our Founders 
merely provided legal clarity and pro-
tection that it not be infringed. 
Government officials who do right 
and follow the Constitution have noth-
ing to fear from an armed citizenry. 
However, government officials who op-
press their people and violate their 
Constitutional oath and the rights 
guaranteed by that Constitution for

the people should rightly fear those 
people. 
As has been said: ‘‘When people fear 
the government, there is tyranny; 
when the government fears the people, 
there is liberty.’’ 
But this administration believes that 
the greatest threat to our country is 
its own people, its own citizens. This is 
what oppressive regimes say. 
This administration never misses an 
opportunity 
to 
attack the Second 
Amendment by seeking to tax and reg-
ulate away our constitutional rights. 
They have blamed law-abiding citi-
zens and licensed firearms dealers for 
the recent surge in violent crime in 
Democrat-run cities. 
They have nominated a gun-grabbing 
radical named David Chipman to lead 
the ATF. 
President Biden has himself repeat-
edly belittled gun owners and their be-
lief that the right to bear arms is es-
sential 
to 
freedom. 
But 
President 
Biden’s opinion does not change the 
Constitution or the Second Amend-
ment. 
In fact, with Biden’s crime surge, 
Biden’s border surge, and Democrat ef-
forts to weaken and undermine law en-
forcement, it is no wonder someone re-
cently said to me: ‘‘I carry a gun be-
cause I can’t carry a cop.’’ 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote: ‘‘What 
country can preserve its liberties if its 
rulers are not warned from time to 
time that their people preserve the 
spirit of resistance? Let them take 
arms.’’ 
The Second Amendment protects all 
other rights and freedoms. 
As my friend CHIP ROY from Texas 
said last week at an event we were at 
together: ‘‘We will live free.’’ 
The Second Amendment is critical to 
ensuring that we live free. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the good gentleman and my good 
friend, Representative GOOD from Vir-
ginia, for his inspiring words. 
As previously noted, Madam Speaker, 
the Biden administration has issued a 
proposed rule that would misinterpret 
the law and criminalize pistols with 
stabilizing braces. My friend from Vir-
ginia, Mr. GOOD, has introduced legisla-
tion to right this wrong and provide 
clear and accurate definitions for both 
rifles and pistols to avoid infringing on 
individuals’ Second Amendment rights, 
and that is H.R. 3823. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. MOORE), my 
good friend from Alabama’s Second 
District. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I thank and appreciate Rep-
resentative CLYDE for his leadership on 
this issue. 
Madam Speaker, recent remarks by 
President Joe Biden about the Second 
Amendment have troubled me and mil-
lions of Americans who own firearms. I 
think they should trouble people on 
both sides of the aisle. I also believe his 
remarks and attitude toward gun own-
ers should trouble all freedom-loving 
Americans, regardless of whether they 
own a gun. 
You see, President Biden’s comments 
about restricting the Second Amend-
ment show a fundamental misunder-
standing of the relationship between 
this Nation’s government and its peo-
ple. 
President Biden believes that the 
American people get their rights from 
the government. Our Founders would 
strongly disagree. 
In fact, they were so skeptical of a 
powerful central government that they 
created an innovative and remarkable 
system of checks and balances to pro-
tect its citizens from a tyrannical gov-
ernment. 
As it was so eloquently phrased in 
our Declaration of Independence: ‘‘to 
secure these rights, Governments are 
instituted among Men, deriving their 
just powers from the consent of the 
governed . . . ’’ 
What powers our Government pos-
sesses was given to it by the people, 
not the other way around. And we gave 
these powers to the Government to 
protect the rights we hold dear. 
The Second Amendment does not 
apply to a particular firearm. It does 
not specify an AR–15, nor does it list a 
musket or a bayonet. It didn’t have to, 
because the Second Amendment pro-
tects the right that you already have, 
the right to bear arms. There is no 
need to continually update the Second 
Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, the Second Amend-
ment is not a permission slip, but an 
assurance that no law will be enacted 
to strip the American people of their 
fundamental right. 
The language of the Second Amend-
ment is clear. And it says: ‘‘The right 
to keep and bear arms shall not be in-
fringed.’’ 
This right was so important to the 
Founders that they would not enact 
the Constitution without the Second 
Amendment’s inclusion in the Bill of 
Rights. 
President Biden’s remarks betray the 
flawed reasoning of so many in the 
Democratic Party, who insist that the 
government is the grantor of rights. It 
is not grantor but the guarantor, the 
protector. The government simply can-
not grant rights given to us by God. It 
protects those God-given rights. 
Americans should be skeptical of any 
philosophy asserting the government 
can restrict the rights we have given it 
the power to protect. If they take your 
guns, what is next? The right to trial 
by jury? Maybe free speech? The right 
to worship who and how we choose? 
Madam Speaker, for the American 
people to keep the liberty we hold dear, 
our constitutional protections, all of 
them, must be maintained. 
Thomas Jefferson said it this way: 
‘‘When the government fears people, 
there is liberty. When the people fear 
the government, there is tyranny.’’ 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the good gentleman from Alabama for 
those inspiring remarks. 
I want to talk about privately-made 
firearms, which I briefly referenced in 
my introductory remarks. 
Undeniably, the Second Amendment, 
the right to keep and bear arms, has 
been fundamental to the freedom and 
security of our Nation since it was first 
founded in 1776. It is the teeth behind 
so many of the other rights and lib-
erties we enjoy. 
We know this to be true, because his-
tory has shown us that when the right 
to keep and bear arms falls, then the 
right of free speech and of the free 
press falls immediately after. 
From our very beginning until today, 
for almost 250 years, people have al-
ways been able to build their own fire-
arms. But that right is at risk, consid-
ering the White House’s gun control 
agenda. 
Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, 
commercial 
firearm 
manufacturers, 
importers, firearm distributors, and re-
tail firearm dealers had to get Federal 
Government licenses in order to con-
tinue 
to 
operate 
their 
businesses. 
Along with those licenses came record- 
keeping requirements and compliance 
inspections to ensure they followed the 
new laws and regulations. This effec-
tively put almost all firearm manufac-
turers and importers under the direct 
control of the Federal Government. 
History also tells us, Madam Speak-
er, that after registration comes con-
fiscation. We saw it happen in Russia 
after the 1917 Communist revolution; in 
Nazi Germany in 1938; in Australia in 
1996; and most recently, in New Zea-
land in 2019. 
In those countries, national registra-
tion led to eventual confiscation. Now 
the ATF wants even privately made 
firearms under their total control. To 
make component parts like upper hous-
ing and slides, those parts that can 
hold a firing pin or a bolt or a bolt car-
rier, to make those simple parts into a 
serialized firearm will have a chilling 
effect on privately made firearms. 
In fact, it could completely eliminate 
privately made firearms, finally plac-
ing all manufacture of firearms under 
complete government control. Those 
fears are genuinely based, and we see 
that today with ATF trying to legis-
late by redefining the meaning of 
words or creating new ones that don’t 
even exist in the written law. 
As I noted earlier in the hour, 
Madam Speaker, I share the passion of 
my Democrat colleagues in keeping 
firearms out of the hands of criminals. 
But in achieving that shared goal, we 
cannot trample on the Second Amend-
ment rights of citizens. 
If the ATF succeeds in pushing these 
new definitions across the finish line, 
Madam Speaker, I fear that we will be 
opening the floodgates to allowing the 
agency to regulate our God-given Sec-
ond Amendment rights right out of ex-
istence. 
I don’t plan to allow that to happen. 
Not on my watch, Madam Speaker. I 
don’t think my colleagues who filled 
these seats earlier plan to allow that to 
happen either.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3232 
June 28, 2021 
Together, with the support of the 
American people, we will never give 
one inch in the defense of the Second 
Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN), my 
good friend who represents Kansas’ 
First District and introduced H.R. 1758, 
the Home Defense and Competitive 
Shooting Act of 2021. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for holding this impor-
tant Special Order to highlight a basic 
right that we all share and love and 
that makes us who we are as Ameri-
cans. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to dis-
cuss President Biden’s misuse of the 
executive order and its harmful impact 
on law-abiding citizens. 
In 1789, George Washington penned 
the first executive order, directing the 
heads of his departments to submit re-
ports on their operations. 
In 1957, my fellow Kansan, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower used the executive order to 
send Federal troops to integrate public 
schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
b 2045 
Nearly every United States President 
has issued executive orders like these 
to instruct the government how to 
work within the parameters set by the 
Congress and the Constitution. Until 
now. 
In his first 10 days as President, Joe 
Biden issued 25 executive orders, more 
than the last seven Presidents com-
bined in their first 10 days. And the list 
continues to grow. Today, we are up to 
nearly 60 executive orders and more ex-
ecutive actions and memoranda than I 
care to count. 
The power to issue executive orders 
is derived from Article II, Section 3 of 
the Constitution, which states that the 
President ‘‘shall take care that the 
laws be faithfully executed.’’ 
When orders are based in facts and 
stakeholder engagement, like those we 
saw with Washington and Eisenhower, 
they work well to steward the execu-
tion of said laws. When the power to 
issue an executive order is abused, 
though, used to strong-hand the minor-
ity or circumvent Congress, the orders 
become a dangerous tool to undermine 
the American people and our democ-
racy. This is what is happening right 
now. 
President Biden recently penned six 
anti-Second Amendment executive ac-
tions in one day, banning handmade 
guns altogether; defining a pistol as a 
short-barreled rifle, allowing for more 
intense regulation; and mandating a 
report on gun gifting and trading. 
In a recent interview on gun control, 
a spokesperson for President Biden 
stated: ‘‘The President will not wait 
for Congress to act before the adminis-
tration takes our own steps, fully with-
in the administration’s authority and 
the Second Amendment.’’ 
We can no longer sit idle and watch 
dozens of executive orders from a sin-
gle administration attempt to dictate 
the direction of our country with no 
input from this Congress. Congress was 
created to legislate. 
Governing by executive order is not 
legislating. That is why I introduced 
H.R. 716, the More Accountability is 
Necessary Now Act, requiring the exec-
utive branch to notify the American 
public and this Congress with its intent 
to issue any new executive order or re-
voking any executive order that per-
tains to our Second Amendment rights. 
I also introduced H.R. 1758, the Home 
Defense and Competitive Shooting Act, 
pushing back on President Biden’s in-
tent to redefine pistols as short-bar-
reled rifles and eliminating the prohi-
bition on transporting short-barreled 
rifles in interstate commerce. 
I invite my colleagues to cosponsor 
both of these pieces of legislation as we 
stand up against any efforts, including 
shameful executive overreach, to di-
minish or weaken the rights of law- 
abiding Americans to own, carry, and 
use firearms. 
The Second Amendment is a load- 
bearing wall in our Constitution. If you 
weaken a load-bearing wall, it is bad 
for the entire structure. 
We must and we will push back 
against the relentless attacks on our 
Second Amendment rights. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, while 
any 
infringement 
of 
our 
Second 
Amendment rights is unconstitutional, 
policymakers 
have 
imposed 
even 
stricter regulations on some types of 
firearms, particularly short-barreled 
rifles. I truly appreciate my friend 
from Kansas’ First District correcting 
this by introducing the Home Defense 
and Competitive Shooting Act of 2021, 
which will accurately classify short- 
barreled rifles as semiautomatic rifles, 
as they should be. They should be semi-
automatic rifles and only semiauto-
matic rifles and regulated as such. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for af-
fording my colleagues and me the op-
portunity to stand before you today in 
defense of the Second Amendment and 
to highlight commonsense, conserv-
ative-led proposals to protect and pre-
serve our rights. 
Madam Speaker, I thank each of my 
colleagues for their participation this 
evening. Their respective constituents 
should be proud to have such staunch 
defenders of the Second Amendment 
representing 
them 
in 
the 
people’s 
House. 
Though several of my colleagues who 
have introduced proposals could not 
join us tonight, the American people 
should know that the solutions high-
lighted in the last hour are not exhaus-
tive of our efforts to restore, protect, 
and preserve our God-given right to 
keep and bear arms. Rather, the solu-
tions presented tonight are just the tip 
of the iceberg. 
Madam Speaker, I again reiterate to 
you my sincere hope that the American 
people will take the opportunity to 
share their thoughts with the ATF on 
the two proposed regulations that I 
mentioned, as you can see on this 
board right here, as they have the po-
tential to upend not only the firearms 
manufacturing industry but also the 
legality of guns in homes across the 
country as we know it. 
My constituents sent me to Congress 
to do everything in my power to pro-
tect and uphold the Constitution, and I 
plan to do just that so long as they en-
trust me with their voting card. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

CBC SUPPORTS INVESTING IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous materials on the subject of 
this Special Order hour. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight for the Congressional 
Black Caucus’ Special Order hour on 
this critically important topic, infra-
structure. Tonight, we will share with 
you our positions, our plans, and the 
state of what we think about infra-
structure. 
I am so honored to be here tonight as 
a coanchor and as chair of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. Traditionally, 
Congresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE 
would be here as our lead anchor. I 
thank her for allowing me, as chair, to 
stand in for her. 
I am so honored that her coanchor 
will now be my coanchor tonight. It 
gives me great pleasure to talk about 
all of our members, Madam Speaker, 
but we are joined by someone who is 
not only a freshman but a freshman 
who is a leader, a freshman who is 
strong, a freshman from New York’s 
15th District, someone who came to 
Congress with a plan, someone who 
came to Congress saying that he wants 
to be here and be able to be a part not 
only of the Congressional Black Caucus 
but to be able to stand up and stand 
out and make a difference for his con-
stituents. Madam Speaker, he has done 
far more than that. 
Congressman RITCHIE TORRES serves 
on the powerful Financial Services 
Committee as a freshman. He is a lead-
er when we talk about housing and in-
frastructure. Tonight, I get to dialogue 
with him. I get to listen to him, and we 
get to talk about other members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
Tonight, we want to speak directly 
to the American people and reflect on

the ideas and the critical interests of 
our constituents. Tonight, we gather in 
the sacred Chamber on the floor of the 
people’s House to discuss America’s in-
frastructure and to amplify Our Power, 
Our 
Message. 
You 
will 
hear 
this 
throughout the evening because we re-
alize that it is about our power and our 
message, 57 members strong of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
Tonight, we will educate our con-
stituents. We will educate Americans 
about the importance of the invest-
ment in infrastructure in our neighbor-
hoods and our communities. 
Tonight, we will stand strong in sup-
port of infrastructure because we know 
roads and schools in our districts are 
crumbling and need urgent repair. 
We also tackle this with bold Federal 
investments in our country’s roads and 
bridges and access to broadband and 
transit and water systems and housing 
and human care. The investment in in-
frastructure, Madam Speaker, would 
support workers and create millions of 
good-paying jobs in urban and rural 
populations, the types of jobs that sup-
port workers, engineers, steelworkers, 
bus drivers, childcare workers, and rail 
workers, and their families. 
Isn’t that what this is about? Isn’t 
that why we stand up for the people, to 
make them able to have good-paying 
jobs to take care of their families? 
The Congressional Black Caucus un-
derstands this because we have lived 
this. I know this all too well when we 
talk about roads and bridges, when we 
talk about waterways and broadband. 
What good is it to say let’s educate 
our children, let’s give them the tech-
nology that they need, and so we give 
them a laptop, a computer and all the 
software, but in many of our rural and 
urban 
communities, 
there 
is 
no 
broadband? 
What good is it to have roads and 
bridges that people can travel, but 
where are they traveling to? They are 
traveling home. But what happens 
when there is no home, when there is 
no housing? 
That is one of the reasons that we are 
here tonight, so that we can talk about 
this investment in our Nation’s future 
that includes extending key tax cred-
its, tax cuts that were included in the 
American Rescue Plan, which the Con-
gressional Black Caucus stood tall to 
help pass, that will benefit lower- and 
middle-income workers and families. 
We even created a domestic policy 
transportation team within the Con-
gressional Black Caucus to talk about 
infrastructure, and I will use their lan-
guage. In their recent meeting, they 
said that we need a modern American 
infrastructure plan. That, too, is what 
tonight is about. 
You will hear facts. You will hear 
data. You will hear stories. You will 
hear the strong testimony of why we 
are saying to all of our colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, that we 
need an infrastructure plan that works 
for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, the majority whip, 
Congressman JAMES CLYBURN, needs no 
real introduction. Mr. CLYBURN hails 
from South Carolina. He has stood on 
this floor repeatedly and talked about 
the American way. He has been a lead-
er, a former chair of the Congressional 
Black 
Caucus, 
someone 
who 
has 
mentored most of us. 
He has repeatedly said to us, which 
we must remember as members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus: We must 
exercise our power and our message. 
We must speak truth to power. And we 
must understand that on days that are 
bad and days that are weak, we are the 
strength. We are the Members that the 
American people who look like me look 
for. We are leaders. 
Often, people will say: What is it that 
the Congressional Black Caucus stands 
for? What is it that the Congressional 
Black Caucus does? 
Well, let me just tell you, the third 
most powerful man in the United 
States Congress is a part of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. We have six 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus that make up full chairs of 
committees and more than 22 that rep-
resent subcommittee chairs. 
Tonight, as we talk about infrastruc-
ture—roads, bridges, broadband, water-
ways—we also talk about care, human 
care, human infrastructure. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
honor to yield to Congressman JAMES 
CLYBURN. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for 
yielding to me. I thank her for the tre-
mendous leadership she has given as 
chair of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. I appreciate her work, and I appre-
ciate her friendship. 
Madam Speaker, I woke up this 
morning to several headlines, one of 
which came from a little town in my 
congressional 
district, 
Summerton, 
South Carolina. 
Those who have studied a little bit of 
our history will know that Summerton 
is a little town that started our Nation 
on the road to Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation. It was Briggs v. Elliott, the 
first 
case 
to 
challenge 
segregated 
schools in this country, and that case 
became one of five that have become 
known as Brown v. Board of Education 
of Topeka, Kansas. 
But that is not why Summerton, 
South Carolina, was in the news today. 
It was in the news today because that 
little town’s entire water system has 
failed. All the people in that town have 
been subjected, over the last several 
weeks, to poison in their water system. 
People were getting sick. Nobody 
knew what was causing it. People were 
being diagnosed with all kinds of 
things, like swimmer’s ear when they 
had never been in a swimming pool. 
b 2100 
Today, the estimated cost of fixing 
their water system is more than the 
entire budget of the town. 
Summerton is just one example of 
what is happening all over this coun-
try. Little towns like Summerton, 
rural communities, schools, childcare 
centers, you name it, the people in that 
little town need their infrastructure 
fixed. 
Now, that is traditional. 
But I will tell you something else 
about the little town of Summerton: 
Scott’s Branch High School, the school 
where Brown v. Board of Education 
started, that is what the school was, 
Scott’s Branch High School; it is still 
there. It is the third building, but the 
school is still named the same. Less 
than 34 percent of the students in that 
school district are connected to the 
internet. 
Now that means in that little school 
that challenged segregation years ago 
because they were not being ade-
quately educated—and I can talk all 
night about this—kids walking 9.4 
miles to school every day one way and 
9.4 miles back home. They weren’t 
suing to integrate the schools, all they 
wanted was a school bus. These are the 
basic things. And you look at that 
school district today, they want to be 
connected to the internet. 
And we have colleagues in this place 
who tell us that they are all for an in-
frastructure bill so long as it confines 
itself 
to 
traditional 
infrastructure 
issues like roads and bridges. 
Well, we need roads and bridges, but 
we need water and sewerage. We need 
to deepen our ports, fix our rail sys-
tems. The greatest country on Earth 
needs to do something about its rail 
system. 
And I remember when rail was not 
traditional infrastructure. Of course, I 
wasn’t around, but I remember from 
my studies when rail was not tradi-
tional infrastructure. It wasn’t until 
Abraham Lincoln gave us the trans-
continental railroad that rail was con-
sidered infrastructure. The interstate 
highway 
was 
not 
infrastructure. 
Dwight Eisenhower gave us the inter-
state highway, and then it became tra-
ditional infrastructure. 
Today broadband has got to be a big 
part of infrastructure. COVID–19 has 
exposed some real flaws in our system, 
and when it comes to education we 
have many children who have already 
lost a full year of school; some are 
threatening to lose a second year of 
school. What happens to a sixth or sev-
enth grader when they lose 2 years of 
school? 
But the children who had the inter-
net stayed in touch with education, 
which tells me that in that school dis-
trict there in Summerton, South Caro-
lina, where less than 40 percent of the 
students are connected to the internet, 
they run the risk of 60 percent of their 
children losing another year of school. 
They will be no better off than those 
students were back when Brown v. 
Board of Education was decided in 1954. 
So this infrastructure bill has got to 
be about more than what is traditional. 
It has got to be looking toward the fu-
ture. And it seems to me that we, as 
the greatest country in the world, need 
to look to the future. What do we want

for our children and our grandchildren? 
We should not tie ourselves to that 
which is traditional. Traditional alone 
means what has been. We need to be fu-
turistic. 
Now before I close, Madam Speaker, I 
want to share a little story. I often tell 
this story. Back when the rural elec-
tric co-ops were celebrating their 50th 
anniversary of rural electrification, 
they decided to publish a tabletop 
book, and they called the book, ‘‘The 
Next Greatest Thing.’’ And the reason 
they called the book, ‘‘The Next Great-
est Thing’’ is because one night a farm-
er in rural Tennessee stood up in 
church and said to them, brothers and 
sisters, let me tell you something, the 
greatest thing on Earth is to have the 
love of God in your heart, but the next 
greatest thing is to have electricity in 
your house. 
Think about that. Broadband will do 
for the 21st century what electricity 
did for rural America in the 20th cen-
tury. And this is our best opportunity 
to bring rural America in line with the 
rest of us and make sure that children 
will not be limited in their educational 
pursuits by where they live. We are too 
great a nation for that. 
This is a great country. It doesn’t 
have to be made great again. What we 
have got to do is make this country’s 
greatness accessible and affordable for 
all of its citizens. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority whip for setting 
the stage for us tonight to talk about 
traditional and nontraditional infra-
structure, 
especially 
broadband. 
I 
think we all learned a message about 
the value of going beyond what the tra-
dition is, and certainly broadband does 
that for us. 
Earlier, Madam Speaker, I had the 
distinct pleasure of saying how hon-
ored I would be to be joined by our co-
anchor tonight, Congressman RITCHIE 
TORRES from New York. 
I yield to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES) for him to make an 
opening statement as we coanchor to-
night. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chair BEATTY
for 
yielding. And I know brevity is the 
soul of wit, so I will express my 
thoughts as succinctly as I can. 
I am honored to be the co-chair of 
the CBC Special Order hour and to 
serve under the dynamic leadership of 
the CBC chair, JOYCE BEATTY, who is a 
force to be reckoned with. I thank the 
gentlewoman for affording me the 
honor to co-chair the CBC Special 
Order hour. 
I echo what our majority whip said, 
that we cannot afford to take an obso-
lete view of infrastructure. Infrastruc-
ture is about more than roads and 
bridges. It is about the quality of the 
air we breathe and the water we drink. 
It is about access to the internet, espe-
cially in a world of remote learning 
and telehealth. It is about safe, decent, 
affordable housing, which is a human 
right. 
Abraham Maslow spoke about a hier-
archy of needs, and the highest need we 
have is self-actualization. And in order 
to actualize ourselves, we have to meet 
our most fundamental needs, our need 
for employment, housing, transit, and 
education. That is what we mean by in-
frastructure. 
Infrastructure is not simply physical, 
but it is social and human. It is that 
which enables us to become the best 
version of ourselves. 
The component of infrastructure that 
matters most to me is affordable hous-
ing. I would not be where I am today 
were it not for affordable housing and 
the stability that it gave me and my 
family. For me affordable housing is 
not simply brick-and-mortar, but it is 
the foundation on which we build a bet-
ter life for ourselves and our family. 
It is often said that the south Bronx 
is the poorest congressional district in 
America, but I think of the south 
Bronx as the essential congressional 
district. Because it is home to essential 
workers who put their lives at risk dur-
ing the peak of the pandemic so that 
the rest of the city and the country 
could safely shelter in place. 
And I believe deeply that the essen-
tial workers of America, the essential 
workers of New York City should be 
able to afford to live in a city that can-
not survive and succeed without them. 
b 2110 
Now, the American Jobs Plan pro-
poses hundreds of billions of dollars in 
new funding for affordable housing, but 
just as important as the dollar amount 
is how those dollars are spent. If we 
simply invest those dollars in expand-
ing housing supply without expanding 
housing subsidy, then we run the risk 
of creating housing that leaves behind 
the lowest income Americans. We run 
the risk of creating the appearance 
rather than the reality of affordable 
housing. 
When the subject of affordable hous-
ing is raised, the question that often 
comes to mind is: Affordable for whom? 
We need deep affordability. We need 
real affordability. And the best path to 
deep affordability—to affordability for 
all Americans—is housing vouchers for 
all. Housing vouchers ensure that you 
pay no more than 30 percent of your in-
come towards your rent. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
sponsor legislation with Chair WATERS 
and 
subcommittee 
Chair 
CLEAVER, 
which would expand the Section 8 pro-
gram and establish housing vouchers as 
an entitlement, as a human right, codi-
fied in Federal law. 
Housing vouchers for all takes on a 
special urgency because we are facing 
the greatest affordability crisis that we 
have seen since the Great Depression. 
There are 37 million Americans who 
pay more than one-third of their in-
come toward their rent. There are 17 
million Americans who pay more than 
half their income toward their rent. 
And that does not even factor in the 
cost of utilities, food, transportation, 
and healthcare. 
There are millions of Americans who 
are living on the brink of foreclosure 
and eviction in the midst of COVID–19. 
And at the heart of the affordability 
crisis is the gap between supply and de-
mand. The demand for affordable hous-
ing far exceeds the supply. 
Madam Speaker, I will provide you 
with some statistics in New York City. 
In New York City, there are 1 million 
households earning at or below 50 per-
cent of AMI, which is about $60,000 a 
year. But there are only 420,000 units 
affordable to those households. That is 
a gap of 580,000 units. 
That is why we need a Federal Gov-
ernment that is going to take an ex-
pansive view of infrastructure and in-
vest in the creation and preservation of 
affordable housing on a scale that we 
have not seen before. Our country de-
serves no less. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those eye- 
opening remarks. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to yield the floor to Congress-
man BOBBY SCOTT. Congressman SCOTT 
hails from Virginia’s Third Congres-
sional District. A proud member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, he is also 
one of those six chairs who I referenced 
earlier. He is chair of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. He is a schol-
ar. He is a lawyer. He also takes the 
lead role when we talk about the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and how we 
plan for the future not only for edu-
cation and childcare, but also how we 
plan for the Congressional Black Cau-
cus’ budget. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), my 
colleague and friend. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding and, more importantly, I 
thank her for her leadership of the 
Congressional Black Caucus and her 
leadership on the Committee on Finan-
cial Services. 
Madam Speaker, we are slowly recov-
ering from the economic mess that we 
inherited after the last administration. 
The number of jobs, up. Unemploy-
ment, down. Initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance, down. The econ-
omy is going in the right direction, 
but, clearly, not fast enough. 
That is why the American Jobs Plan 
and the American Families Plan are so 
important. The American Jobs Plan 
will create funding for the traditional 
infrastructure, like roads, bridges, tun-
nels, rail, public transit; also invest-
ments in ports. 
It also proposes significant invest-
ment in broadband. And we have heard 
how important broadband is because it 
connects families and businesses to the 
internet, and connects students to the 
internet. Those students who did not 
have connectivity could not take ad-
vantage of educational opportunities 
for over a year, and if they don’t get 
connectivity, they will be disadvan-
taged going forward. 
We need to have universal broadband, 
and the investments in the American

Jobs Plan and the American Families 
Plan will go a long way towards uni-
versal access to broadband. 
We even have electric charging sta-
tions for people who are not inclined to 
buy electric cars if they can’t charge 
those cars on the highway. And people 
are not building charging stations 
along the highway because there are 
not that many electric cars. 
The American Jobs Plan will have 
funding for electric charging stations 
so that more people will be inclined to 
buy electric cars. And not surprisingly, 
as soon as that happens, all of the res-
taurants up and down the highways 
will have charging stations so people 
will be inclined to hook up; and while 
they are waiting, they will go in and 
take advantage of the restaurant. 
Madam Speaker, those are just some 
of the investments in the American 
Jobs Plan. 
It also includes school construction. 
There is an article recently in Virginia 
that told the story that about 50 per-
cent of the schools in the Common-
wealth of Virginia are over 50 years 
old. That sends a disappointing mes-
sage to students when they are going 
into old schools. It gives the impres-
sion that education is not important. 
We need to improve our schools, and we 
can do that with the funding in the 
American Jobs Plan. 
Madam Speaker, we have funding to 
improve housing, that we have heard, 
and many other projects. Creating mil-
lions of jobs, good-paying jobs—mostly 
union jobs—where they are guaranteed 
to be able to negotiate a decent wage 
and equal pay for equal work. But 
those jobs will go unfilled unless we 
also pass the American Families Plan, 
which has funding for childcare and 
early childhood education and im-
proved child nutrition so parents can 
actually go to work; job training and 
apprenticeships and improved access to 
higher education so workers can get 
the skills needed to perform those jobs. 
These bills will create millions of 
jobs and enable workers to perform 
those jobs, and these programs will be 
fiscally responsible because they will 
be paid for. 
Madam Speaker, that is how we will 
build back a better America. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks. 
Congressman BOBBY SCOTT is right. To-
night is about building back better. To-
night is about the Congressional Black 
Caucus demonstrating our power, our 
message. 
Madam Speaker, as I talk about our 
power and our message, it gives me 
great pleasure to yield the floor to 
Congressman ANDRE´ CARSON, who hails 
from Indiana’s Seventh Congressional 
District. He is the grandson of a leg-
end, someone who served in this House, 
someone who I had the opportunity to 
know and to witness her work in Con-
gresswoman Julia Carson. 
Tonight, my friend, my colleague, a 
leader when we talk about intelligence 
or counterterrorism, when we talk 
about looking at the future and how we 
stand up for infrastructure. He serves 
on the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, so he comes to us 
this evening to share his thoughts on 
how the Congressional Black Caucus 
can help with this infrastructure plan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON). 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Congressional Black Caucus 
for giving us a leader, a hero, a vision-
ary, a general, and a true public serv-
ant in Chairwoman JOYCE BEATTY, a 
fellow Midwesterner. 
Madam Speaker, when I see people 
like Congresswoman BEATTY, it moti-
vates me in the spirit of my grand-
mother, in the spirit of Fannie Lou 
Hamer, in the spirit of Harriet Tub-
man, in the spirit of Sojourner Truth. 
That fearlessness, that boldness, that 
commitment to liberation in freeing us 
from physical shackles along with 
mental shackles. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to join 
my great colleagues in the Congres-
sional Black Caucus tonight in support 
of the INVEST Act, a bill that we 
marked up over 18 hours in the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure. 
Madam Speaker, now this is one of 
the greenest bills to ever come to the 
floor. It provides strong support for 
sustainable infrastructure, green infra-
structure, and green transit. 
The INVEST Act also addresses crit-
ical water projects for clean drinking 
water and wastewater projects, prior-
ities that are long overdue after the ra-
cial injustices discovered in the Flint 
water crisis. 
b 2120 
The INVEST Act includes strong job 
creation provisions for minority con-
tractors 
and 
transportation 
profes-
sionals that will help spur Black gener-
ational success and wealth. 
We also know that access to reliable 
transportation is a civil rights pri-
ority. It is critical to economic and 
educational opportunities. 
This bill makes big investments to 
cut carbon emissions. For electric ve-
hicle 
technologies, 
it 
expands 
EV 
charging stations and networks across 
our country by investing $4 billion in 
charging infrastructure, helping the 
U.S. shift to the next generation of 
clean vehicles. I am especially proud of 
the EV charging stations approved in 
the bill for Indianapolis, which has one 
of the first green bus rapid transit sys-
tems. 
This bill also dedicates $8.3 billion 
for activities targeted to reduce carbon 
pollution and provides $6.2 billion for 
mitigation 
and 
resiliency 
improve-
ments. It also advances the develop-
ment and utilization of green construc-
tion materials. 
It makes our roads safer with a great 
boost to smart road technologies and 
roadway safety programs, plus record 
levels of investment in walking and cy-
cling infrastructure, complete streets 
planning and smarter road design, and 
safe routes to schools. 
This bill also strengthens passenger 
rail service, as Mr. CLYBURN
men-
tioned. At my request, our staff re-
quest, there were provisions included 
to improve rail safety by addressing 
highway-rail grade crossing needs, as 
well as addressing trespasser and sui-
cide fatalities and eliminating gaps in 
railroad safety. 
This bill also creates a Federal 
blocked crossing program to collect 
data and enforce a 10-minute blocked 
crossing limit. This is a huge win for 
the problems we have faced in Indian-
apolis and other places as well. 
Madam Speaker, the INVEST Act is 
a long-overdue bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to help us in passing this mon-
umental piece of legislation. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman CARSON. I thank 
him for reminding us that America’s 
infrastructure is in desperate need of 
investment. That is what this is about. 
Talking about investment, Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), the 
second vice chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, the chair of the Wom-
en’s Caucus, someone who understands 
infrastructure 
probably 
more 
than 
most of us. You see, when she started 
as a postal worker before she worked 
her way up, she was in the community 
and on those roads. She was traveling 
across those bridges, and she was lis-
tening to people. That is why her con-
stituents voted her to be mayor. As 
mayor, we certainly understand the 
things that you are hit with the most, 
our 
infrastructure, 
our 
roads, 
our 
bridges, our care for human infrastruc-
ture. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Congressional Black Caucus. 
I want to recognize and say how much 
we appreciate and how much Congress 
has benefited from the bold leadership 
of our chair, JOYCE BEATTY. I thank 
her for hosting, with the Congressional 
Black Caucus leadership, this Special 
Order hour. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on 
the urgent infrastructure issue that 
needs and deserves the attention and 
the action of this body. Our water in-
frastructure in the United States is in 
serious need of repair. 
Families in Michigan and across this 
country are struggling to get safe and 
clean drinking water because of lead 
pipes in their homes and communities, 
not to mention the contamination of 
our water system sources. 
I am from Michigan, and the Great 
Lakes weigh on my mind constantly as 
the largest body of freshwater in this 
country. 
A 2016 study found that there were 
more than 6 million lead service lines 
across the United States, serving 15 to 
22 million Americans. This is a crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I have lived through 
and witnessed the Flint water crisis in 
Michigan. I saw where the people, the 
United States citizens of this country,

their drinking water was poisoned, and 
because of that, we saw them getting 
sick and being hospitalized. 
I am sad to say, not only did it hap-
pen in Flint, but it is happening all 
over our country. This issue dispropor-
tionately affects communities of color 
and the poor. 
We have an opportunity, a once in a 
generation chance, to rebuild our infra-
structure and to build back better for 
the American people. The Americans 
Jobs Plan and the bipartisan infra-
structure framework both tackle our 
water infrastructure problem. 
These proposals will replace lead 
pipelines across this country. It is an 
action that is long overdue. 
This is an investment that could not 
come soon enough. I want this Con-
gress to know that the Federal invest-
ment in public water infrastructure 
projects—it is embarrassing to say— 
under our watch has fallen from 63 per-
cent of our overall investment in 1977 
to just 9 percent in 2014. Let me repeat 
that. We invested, at one time, as a 
government, 63 percent in our water, 
and now it is down to 9 percent. This is 
unacceptable. 
Let’s pass a comprehensive infra-
structure package to rebuild our water 
infrastructure, 
fix 
our 
roads 
and 
bridges, and invest in electric vehicles 
while creating good-paying jobs and po-
sitioning ourselves for the future. 
This is a public health issue; it is a 
racial justice issue; and it is an eco-
nomic justice issue. Access to clean 
water is a basic necessity for human 
life. 
I am grateful to stand with my col-
leagues from the Congressional Black 
Caucus and call for our Nation’s invest-
ment in infrastructure. This is our 
power, and this is our message. We 
must get this done. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman BRENDA
LAW-
RENCE. She is absolutely right; this is a 
public issue. This is a racial justice 
issue because we know our roads, our 
bridges, and our water systems are 
crumbling. We know our electric grid is 
at risk of catastrophic outages. We 
know many schools are crumbling from 
lack of attention and neglect. Too 
many lack access to affordable hous-
ing, and too many lack access to 
childcare and education. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS). We call her our HBCU czar. 
She is the chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus’ HBCU caucus, histori-
cally Black colleges and universities. 
She is also more than that. She has 
spent a lifetime educating children and 
college students. 
She serves on the powerful Financial 
Services Committee, and she has a 
strong voice on the Education and 
Labor 
Committee 
and 
Agriculture 
Committee. 
b 2130 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
BEATTY
for 
yielding. 
I 
thank 
Representative 
TORRES for his leadership and thank 
Chairwoman BEATTY for being such a 
phenomenal leader and a role model for 
all of us. 
I am pleased to be here tonight to 
support the Congressional Black Cau-
cus members, known as the conscious 
of the Congress, not only because of 
what we believe, but because we show 
up on days like this. 
I rise tonight to talk about an essen-
tial infrastructure investment, an in-
vestment in our historically Black col-
leges and universities. 
Earlier this year, the bipartisan lead-
ership of the HBCU Caucus, Represent-
ative FRENCH HILL from Arkansas, Sen-
ator CHRIS COONS from Delaware, and 
TIM SCOTT from South Carolina, as well 
as our vice chairs, Representative 
TERRI SEWELL and MIKE TURNER, came 
together to introduce the bipartisan 
IGNITE HBCU Excellence Act. 
We introduced this legislation to help 
light a fire for our schools. The IGNITE 
HBCU Excellence Act represents a his-
toric investment in both the physical 
and the digital infrastructure of our 
historically Black colleges. 
Our Nation’s HBCUs deserve a level 
of investment and engagement reflec-
tive of their multibillion dollar impact 
on our Nation’s economy and their col-
lective impact on the minds of millions 
of our Nation’s future leaders. 
We have bipartisan agreement on 
that. Don’t just take it from me. In the 
words of Senator TIM SCOTT, ‘‘HBCUs 
have educated and produced top-notch 
graduates in every field—all while op-
erating on minimal budgets. I can only 
imagine what more they will accom-
plish with proper funding.’’ 
Our Nation’s low-income, first-gen-
eration college students deserve that 
opportunity, and to ensure that that 
happens, the schools that they attend 
must be made whole. There are more 
than 102 across this Nation. I had the 
privilege of serving for 40 years on the 
campus of Bennett College in Greens-
boro, and I am a graduate twice of 
North Carolina A&T State University, 
and Johnson C. Smith University is in 
my district. 
Finally, as we have a national debate 
about infrastructure in Congress and 
across the country, I want to make one 
thing clear, that the IGNITE HBCU Ex-
cellence Act is not only an infrastruc-
ture bill, it is also a jobs bill. And this 
bill creates jobs and enables HBCUs to 
continue to be a critical source of di-
versity in the workforce. This bill has 
the potential to create over half a mil-
lion jobs while investing in critical 
HBCU infrastructure. 
Historically Black colleges and uni-
versities are essential infrastructure 
for the next generation of students, 
workers, innovators, athletes, creators, 
thinkers, and leaders, and that is why 
we need to pass the most trans-
formative legislation for historically 
Black colleges and universities in his-
tory. You have got to rectify over 150 
years of neglect, broken promises, and 
institutional racism. 
Any 
infrastructure 
package 
that 
leaves this House must include a his-
toric investment in our HBCUs. I am 
not going to rest until we remove all of 
the barriers to their success and the 
success of our HBCU students. 
So I ask my colleagues to please join 
me in our bipartisan list of over 70 co-
sponsors in the House and Senate in 
supporting the IGNITE HBCU Excel-
lence Act. Our power. Our message. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS for her 
comments. 
It is always a pleasure when we have 
the opportunity to work together. And 
I say to Congressman TORRES that that 
is what we are going to do tonight. 
I could not think of a better segue 
than to pitch it to Representative 
TORRES. We have two members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus from the 
great State of New York. I am so used 
to saying the great State of Ohio, but 
tonight we have two freshman mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Caucus 
who have been great supporters to our 
message, our power, who have been 
fearless leaders. 
So at this time, I say to Congressman 
TORRES, my coanchor, that I think it 
would be best for him to yield the floor 
to and make some remarks about Con-
gressman JAMAAL
BOWMAN
who will 
speak next. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, we are not only from the 
great State of New York but the great 
county of the Bronx. 
Education is infrastructure and who 
better to speak about education than a 
lifelong educator. 
Well, before running for Congress, 
our next speaker was a principal who 
dedicated his life to educating the stu-
dents of the northeast Bronx. He is one 
of the first Black Members of Congress 
to ever represent Westchester County, 
which has historically been ground 
zero for resistance to fair housing. 
If you have ever seen the movie, 
‘‘Show Me a Hero,’’ in Yonkers, that is 
the district of our next speaker. Even 
though he embodies how far we have 
come as a country, he knows more 
than most how far we must go. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BOWMAN), 
the one and only. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman TORRES for that in-
troduction and for yielding, and I 
thank him for his overall leadership 
and vision, not just for our country, 
but for the Boogie Down Bronx. 
I thank Madam Chairwoman for her 
incomparable leadership, and wisdom, 
and vision for the CBC and for our 
country. 
It is my honor to stand here with 
both of you to call for a big, bold, vi-
sionary infrastructure package that fi-
nally addresses the disparities in our 
economy. We like to think of America 
as the land of opportunity where any-
one can achieve success and shape their

own future with little more than hard 
work and determination. For many 
people, that is exactly the reality that 
they exist within, thanks to a little 
luck, determination, opportunity, and 
one-sided historical Federal invest-
ment. 
Some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle would like to us be-
lieve that this accurately represents 
our history, but, unfortunately, most 
Black Americans have been written out 
of this narrative. Consider the world as 
it exists today in our history of the 
redlining of Black and Brown commu-
nities, as well as other racially biased 
policies of the New Deal. These divi-
sions have always been rooted in Fed-
eral policy. 
President Biden has said he considers 
this infrastructure package to con-
stitute a generational investment in 
the American public and in commu-
nities like mine in the Bronx, Mount 
Vernon, New Rochelle, and Yonkers. 
And now is the time for us to right the 
wrongs of that history. 
The infrastructure package of 2021 
must be rooted in racial and economic 
justice. We must uplift the care econ-
omy, fix our public housing, rebuild 
our crumbling schools, expand access 
to Medicare, and end our dependency 
on fossil fuels, among many other 
things. No American with this infra-
structure package should be left be-
hind. 
As the White House considers this in-
frastructure package, let’s take a deep-
er trip into our history. In 1862, Con-
gress passed the Homestead Act, redis-
tributing 10 percent of the land in the 
country, arguably constituting the sin-
gle greatest wealth transfer in our his-
tory. African Americans never received 
their 40 acres of land after slavery, 
while White Americans received mil-
lions of acres of land which gave them 
the opportunity to self-actualize. 
Housing now accounts for over 40 per-
cent of household wealth, with much of 
this housing-related wealth stemming 
from Federal investments in homeown-
ership during the New Deal. Because of 
redlining—one of the largest drivers of 
the wealth gap—of the over $1 trillion 
invested between 1934 and 1962, in 2021 
dollars, less than 2 percent went to 
non-White families. 
We can no longer attempt to build 
out the middle class on the backs of 
marginalized communities. We must 
make sure that the next round of gen-
erational investment incorporates ev-
eryone, beginning with those most 
marginalized. 
If we make this infrastructure pack-
age inclusive and comprehensive, we 
can give every single American a job, a 
career, and the resources they need to 
flourish from the Bronx; to Mount 
Vernon; to Yonkers; to New Rochelle, 
New York. 
If we have the courage to address the 
climate, economic, and racial injus-
tices that threaten the human race, we 
can give our children and grand-
children a future they deserve. 
We can either impart the full story of 
American history to our children or 
doom ourselves to relive it. In the case 
of infrastructure, an investment of this 
scale, repeating the failures of the past 
is unacceptable. To meet the promise 
of our democracy, we must give every 
person in our country an opportunity 
to both survive and thrive. That begins 
with a robust and comprehensive infra-
structure package. This is our time. 
This is our moment.

Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BOWMAN
for re-
minding us of our history, as well as 
the need. 
I am sure if Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE was at this microphone 
tonight, 
Congressman 
TORRES, 
she 
would look to you and she would say, 
let’s get this done. She would look to 
you and she would remind us that part 
of this bold action means we must use 
all of our available resources. 
She would remind us, in 2017, that 
the Republicans used the reconcili-
ation process twice. Oh, how I remem-
ber how they used it against the Af-
fordable Care Act. And how I remember 
that they used it not only for taking 
away American’s healthcare, but a sec-
ond time to pass the GOP tax scam of 
2017, in giving more money to those in 
the top 1 percent. 
But, tonight, we have heard from the 
top of our leadership. We have heard 
from Members from across the United 
States. 
Now it gives me great pleasure to 
bring our last speaker to the podium. 
He is also our newest Member to Con-
gress. He hails from the great State of 
Louisiana. He is someone who is no 
stranger to being an elected official. He 
is someone who has dedicated his life 
to serving the people. He has been suc-
cessful. He is here in his own right, 
serving on the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee, as well as the 
Small Business Committee. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER), my col-
league and friend. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Madam Chairman BEATTY, 
Coanchor TORRES, it is indeed an honor 
to join you tonight with your incred-
ible leadership, Madam Chair, with 
your tenacious ability to lead, direct, 
and command the respect of 57 Mem-
bers of this august body, to fight tire-
lessly on behalf of the people of your 
district, but also all the people of our 
great country. I thank you for your 
leadership. 
This week, the House will take up an 
important bill for our Nation’s future, 
the INVEST Act. 
Americans have grown weary, and 
justifiably so. We have talked about an 
infrastructure bill for a very long time, 
and we have kicked the proverbial ball 
down the road as far as we can. 
The people deserve more. The people 
deserve better. They deserve an infra-
structure plan now, and one that 
speaks to traditional infrastructure, 
brick and mortar, as well as human in-
frastructure, broadband, housing, op-
portunities for our communities to re-
build, to grow, to thrive. 
As a Member of the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
and as a Representative of one of the 
largest transportation hubs in the Na-
tion, I know this legislation will re-
imagine and rebuild our infrastructure 
in Louisiana and across America. 
This is a big bill and it does big 
things. It steps up to the challenges we 
face now and prepares us for challenges 
to come in the future. It powers eco-
nomic development, creating good-pay-
ing jobs, building and fixing our crum-
bling infrastructure. 
It connects communities by sup-
porting public transit and new, high- 
speed, low-emission railways between 
cities like New Orleans and Baton 
Rouge and the river parishes in be-
tween. 
It restores communities that have 
been harmed by old transportation de-
cisions, like neighborhoods and dis-
tricts that were cut in half and live in 
the shadows of interstate overpasses. 
It also invests in passenger and 
freight rail. Both are very important to 
me because my district is home to the 
only port served by six Class 1 rail-
roads, and it contains a corridor that 
badly needs new high-speed rail from 
New Orleans to Baton Rouge. 
Investing in and supporting freight 
rail would allow them to continue driv-
ing our economy and reducing green-
house gases from shipping. 
The plan to connect New Orleans and 
Baton Rouge was delayed by a short-
sighted decision of a previous Gov-
ernor. But this bill and this adminis-
tration gets us back on track. 
Connecting two of the biggest cities 
in the State with high-speed passenger 
rail makes all the sense in the world; 
tying communities together, creating 
jobs and opportunities throughout the 
State of Louisiana, providing the re-
sources to have cleaner forms of trans-
portation. 
Infrastructure now means so much 
more than stop signs and sidewalks. It 
means access to broadband, affordable 
and safe housing, and support for peo-
ple caring for parents or children. 
This bill starts that, and the rest of 
our efforts must continue to move for-
ward in the vein of including people. 
We need physical infrastructure, but 
we also need human infrastructure. We 
need to invest in highways and ports, 
but we also need to invest in the envi-
ronment and the environmental safety 
of our communities, because I have 
long said that people should not have 
to die for their jobs. We must invest in 
the corrections that will create a safer 
and better environment. We need to in-
vest in our people. We need to invest in 
affordable housing and the opportuni-
ties for neighborhoods and commu-
nities to stand up. 
I look forward to fighting for all of 
this, and then some. I look forward to

building back better. America deserves 
better. America deserves more. Amer-
ica deserves a robust infrastructure 
plan, and America deserves it now. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do we have left, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Then let me close by 
saying thank you to all of the Members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus. It 
was clear tonight that infrastructure is 
not only a big word, but it is a big deal, 
which encompasses many concepts, 
which comprises modern American in-
frastructure. 
For some Members we have heard to-
night, it is through traditional roads 
and bridges and waterways. For others, 
it is broadband and it is housing, it is 
human care. 
Regardless of definition, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus is ready to stand 
in the gap to support legislation and 
policies that will help infrastructure 
invest in America’s future so we can 
build back better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES) to 
say thank you to our Members. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I will just quickly state, you 
know, we are in the midst of an FDR 
moment, and we have an historic op-
portunity to govern as boldly in the 
21st century as FDR did in the 20th 
century. But the difference between 
then and now is ours is going to be a 
new deal for everyone; Black and 
Brown new deal. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Strong. Congressional 
Black Caucus, our power, our message. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SPEECH OF 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is 
imperative that we work together to reduce 
harmful methane pollution as soon as pos-
sible. That is why I strongly support S.J. Res. 
14 which will get America back on track in 
controlling methane pollution and leaks. 
Methane is a highly potent gas that, pound 
for pound, traps more than 80 times as much 
heat on our planet in the short term as carbon 
dioxide. Plugging methane pollution leaks is 
good for our public health, as it can reduce 
the risk of asthma, heart attacks, and pre-
mature deaths. Reducing methane pollution is 
good for the climate, it’s good for business, 
and it will create thousands and thousands of 
jobs across America. That’s why there is 
broad consensus from energy companies, 
local communities, the tourism industry, labor 
groups, environmental organizations, environ-
mental justice leaders, and faith leaders on 
methane pollution control. 
In fact, in 2019, when my Select Committee 
on the Climate Crisis was doing our broad out-
reach to develop recommendations for solving 
the climate crisis, this was an area where we 
reached broad consensus, as a wide range of 
stakeholders and scientists told us reducing 
methane pollution would be needed to help 
save our planet. 
Adopting today’s resolution will restore com-
mon-sense safeguards to limit methane pollu-
tion from oil and gas production, as we re-
verse the Trump Administration’s misguided 
efforts that stopped them. Restoring these 
safeguards is one of the recommendations we 
included in the Select Committee’s Climate 
Crisis Action Plan. It’s a modest and straight-
forward step in the right direction, but it’s a 
very important one. 
Controlling dangerous methane pollution 
has broad support. A recent Morning Consult 
poll found that an overwhelming majority of 
Americans—including 81 percent of Repub-
licans—support congressional actions requir-
ing oil and gas companies to regulate, check 
for, and fix methane leaks. 
And it is more important now than ever. This 
year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration announced that, despite the 
COVID–19 pandemic and the various shut-
downs around the globe, carbon dioxide and 
methane emissions surged in 2020, including 
the largest increase in methane emissions re-
corded since record-keeping began nearly four 
decades ago. 
Furthermore, we know that fossil fuels are 
playing an outsized role in this crisis. Accord-
ing to an analysis published by scientists from 
NASA and Stanford last year, fossil fuel-re-
lated methane emissions in the United States 
contributed approximately 80 percent of the 
total increase of methane for North America 
from 2006 to 2017. Stopping methane and 
other pollution from oil and gas production is 
an important step in solving the climate crisis. 
Even major oil companies—from BP America 
to Shell to ExxonMobil—support federal regu-
lation of methane pollution. Building on the ex-
amples of Colorado, Wyoming and Ohio, a na-
tionwide standard is critical to protect—Ameri-
cans everywhere from harmful air pollution 
stemming from oil and gas production. 
Let’s be clear: We must cut methane pollu-
tion to prevent catastrophic climate change. 
Today we have the opportunity to move in that 
direction by supporting this resolution. This an 
important step, and it is the least we can do. 
I want to thank my good friends Congress-
woman DEGETTE and Congressman PETERS 
for their outspoken advocacy on this matter, 
and I look forward to working with my col-
leagues and the Biden Administration to build 
on this progress.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF BRIGA-
DIER GENERAL ROBERT RAISCH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Brigadier General 
Robert Raisch of Lathrup Village, Michigan. 
His lifetime of service to both Michigan and 
our country is worthy of commendation. 
General Raisch was born December 8, 
1929 in Detroit, Michigan. Following his grad-
uation from Cranbrook High School, he at-
tended Duke University where he majored in 
mechanical engineering. In 1951, Raisch was 
commissioned into the United States Marine 
Corps Reserve and began pilot training in 
preparation for service in the Korean War. 
While assigned to Marine Fighting Squadron 
224 during the conflict, Raisch flew the F–9F 
‘‘Panther’’ alongside fellow marines John 
Glenn and Ted Williams. For his heroism, 
Raisch was awarded two Distinguished Flying 
Crosses. In 1965, Raisch entered the ready 
reserve and held several key positions across 
the state of Michigan including Commander, 
Selfridge Air National Guard Base (SANGB) in 
Harrison Township. He retired in 1980 after 
nearly three decades in uniform and founded 
the Supersine Company, a sign manufacturing 
business that he would operate for more than 
fifty years. 
As a Detroiter, Raisch was active in his 
community—mounting the Spirit of Detroit stat-
ue, serving as a Distinguished Clown in the 
Thanksgiving Parade (a role he would also 
take on in the Macy’s Day Parade in New 
York City), and supporting numerous charities. 
His love of animals inspired him to create the 
Restore the Horse Foundation, which played a 
key role in re-establishing the Detroit Mounted 
Police. Raisch was a true Michigander and a 
proud summer resident of Mackinac Island 
where he directed local plays and took part in 
countless community events. Beloved by his 
family, Raisch would always point to his chil-
dren Robert, Elizabeth, Laura, and Julie as his 
greatest achievements and his wife Susan of 
67 years as his greatest love. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Brigadier General 
Robert Raisch. He was a bright and shining 
light in our community and all who knew him 
can attest to his selflessness, patriotism, and 
unwavering wit. Our thoughts are with his fam-
ily at this time.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
NAVAL 
SUB-
MARINE 
MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
LABORATORY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 75th anniversary of 
the Naval Submarine Medical Research Lab-
oratory, which occurred on Friday, June 25, 
2021. Located at the Naval Submarine Base 
New London in Groton, Connecticut, the re-
search center has served Connecticut’s sec-
ond district, the region, and the nation as a 
hub of excellence, ensuring the readiness and 
primacy of the United States’ undersea deter-
rence efforts by way of cutting edge health 
and performance research. 
Although Friday’s date marks the official 
date of the Naval Submarine Medical Re-
search Laboratory’s 75th anniversary, the Re-
search Laboratory’s origins date back to as 
early as 1942 when it was created as an arm 
of the Naval Submarine Base New London 
Dispensary. During the earliest stages of 
America’s direct involvement in the Second 
World War, when our nation’s submarine force 
was put to one of its greatest tests, the center 
was created to provide answers to problems in 
communications, vision, personnel, selection, 
and environmental medicine resulting from 
wartime demands. The success of the Re-
search Laboratory was evident from its earliest 
beginnings when in March 1944 it separated 
from the dispensary and became the inde-
pendent Medical Research Department of the 
Submarine Base. Throughout the remainder of 
World War II, this department became respon-
sible for the organization, development and 
operation of numerous training programs, in-
cluding the school for Pharmacist Mates enter-
ing the submarine service, the Lookout Train-
ing School, the Voice Communication School, 
and the school for Second Class Divers. 
By June 1946, with the full conclusion of the 
War, the Research Laboratory formally gained

command status as the Medical Research 
Laboratory, under the direction of the Navy’s 
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. From there, 
its mission grew to the selection of all officers 
and enlisted for training at the Naval Sub-
marine School, specialized training in sub-
marine medicine for hospital corpsmen and 
medical officers and research into the medical 
aspects of submarines and diving. As our mar-
itime national security policy evolved to meet 
the demands of the Cold War Era and new 
age of nuclear deterrence, so too did the Re-
search Laboratory’s avenues of focus and in-
novation, including its innovative work in sub-
marine rescue experiments. 
The Research Laboratory has worked tire-
lessly to push the field of underwater safety 
forward in the decades since. For example, it 
has developed countless reliable products in-
cluding the International Orange high-visibility 
color enhancing rescue at sea, the Farnsworth 
Lantern color vision test, the improved Sub-
marine Escape Immersion Equipment suit, the 
enhanced Disabled Submarine Survival Guide 
as well as numerous generations of the 
Navy’s diving and decompression tables which 
are still in use today. In fact, the Research 
Laboratory’s work has also been instrumental 
in evolving our nation’s submarines to become 
more healthy, productive and disciplined 
places of work. This includes its adoption of 
smoke-free submarine environments, produc-
tion of studies that supported women serving 
aboard and studies that have produced a bet-
ter understanding of effective shifts of duty as 
a result of changes to an individual’s natural 
circadian sleep cycle while aboard a sub-
marine. The sleep research resulted in a 
healthy change in submarine work and sleep 
schedules that has since been embraced by 
the modem U.S. submarine force. In the wake 
of tragic ship collisions in 2017 that resulted in 
devastating loss of lives, the New London 
based-research is now being applied to our 
nation’s surf ace fleet. 
Madam Speaker, as the Congressman who 
has the honor to represent Submarine Base 
New London, and has visited the lab, I can at-
test to the talent and passionate commitment 
of the workforce at that facility, whose unique 
mission is truly a national treasure. Employing 
sophisticated, one-of-a-kind equipment, the 
Naval Submarine Medical Research Labora-
tory and its dedicated staff of scientists remain 
experts in many highly specialized areas to 
this day. They serve the fleet and support our 
Nation’s undersea troops by conducting stud-
ies that ensures the readiness and effective-
ness of submariners and divers operating 
aboard submarines, those operating in the un-
dersea battle space, and warfighters fighting 
from the sea. To that end, on this 75th Anni-
versary of its founding, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring all those who have served, 
currently serve, or will serve at the Naval Sub-
marine Medical Research Laboratory.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
EARL ‘‘BOB’’ SMITTCAMP 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Robert Smittcamp. He passed 
away on March 4, 2021 after many years of 
significant contributions to the San Joaquin 
Valley. Robert was a part of the community, 
and a dear friend to many. 
Robert was born in Fresno, California to 
Earl and Muriel Smittcamp on May 29, 1941. 
In 1945, his family purchased the Wawona 
Ranch from Muriel’s father that held 40 acres 
of peaches. This later was known as the 
Smittcamp Family Business. Having a father 
who served in World War II as a marine, Rob-
ert was a hard worker along with his siblings, 
Carol, Betsy, and Bill. By the age of 10, Rob-
ert knew how to operate a forklift. When Rob-
ert was diagnosed with polio in 1953, he spent 
months in an iron lung in his parent’s living 
room on the ranch. He developed his faith in 
God during that time and became an acolyte 
in his church. 
In 1959, Robert graduated with honors from 
Clovis High School and was involved with FFA 
where he earned many local and national 
awards. After graduating from California State 
University, Fresno in 1964 with a BS in Busi-
ness-Economics, he and his father, Earl, 
founded Wawona Frozen Foods. The frozen 
fruit business thrived in downtown Fresno and 
in 1965 a freezer plant was built on Alluvia 1 
Avenue in Clovis, California. A year later, Rob-
ert enlisted in the United States Army Reserve 
in 1965 through 1966 driving the Army Gen-
eral to and from military events in San Fran-
cisco. He learned cooking tips from the chefs 
in the kitchen that the General would dine at 
for his meetings, During his time in the Army 
Reserve, Robert still enjoyed working along-
side his father. Soon after, Janell Robinson 
entered Robert’s life while in the Army Re-
serves, and in 1966, they married and began 
their own family in 1968 with son Brent and 
their daughter Lisa in 1970. Janell gave birth 
to their second son, Brandon in 1982. 
His father, Earl had a big influence on Rob-
ert’s life. When Earl ran for State Senate, 
Robert saw another path he could take, with 
politics. His interest in politics began and he 
became a wise mentor for many people, but 
also continued to see himself working in a 
business. In 1971, Earl and Robert acquired 
the San Francisco based Lyons-Magnus and 
decided to move that company to the city of 
Clovis. Robert served as the President and 
CEO for over 40 years. They made ice cream 
toppings, fruit toppings and non-carbonated 
drink bases. The company became an inter-
nationally renowned food manufacturing com-
pany. While raising his family, Robert contin-
ued to work on the company’s growth. In 
1983, Lyons-Magnus leased a manufacturing 
plant in Kentucky, and after two years the 
company installed and operated the first a 
septic bottle filler in the United States in Clo-
vis. In 1989, the plant was moved to down-
town Fresno. The company worked with com-
panies like Starbucks, McDonalds, Carl’s Jr., 
Dairy Queen, and more. 
When Brent grew older, he worked with his 
father and Grandpa Earl. In 1997, Robert and 
Brent purchased 160 acres together as the B 
& B Ranch. They worked on the Wawona 
Packing Company fanning over 8,000 acres 
and the ranch. Robert’s youngest son, Bran-
don, shared another one of Robert’s passions 
and got into the restaurant business. Robert 
assisted him in acquiring The Lime Lite, a 
Fresno-based restaurant, 
In 2015, Robert married Annette and wel-
comed her sons Michael and Steven into the 
family. Robert’s family grew and so did the 
companies. In 2017, Robert and Brent decided 
to sell their companies to the same private eq-
uity company and stay on the Board of Direc-
tors. Robert, Brent, and Brandon all worked 
together. 
Robert had a strong passion to serve the 
community. He was on Boards such as the 
Community Regional Medical Center, Stanford 
Medical Centers Cardiovascular Institute, St. 
Agnes Hospital, Board of Governors of Cali-
fornia State University, and more. His dona-
tions to causes, hospitals, universities, non-
profits and more throughout the San Joaquin 
Valley were endless. He donated $1 million to 
help expand a neuroscience program and re-
model the intensive care unit at Community 
Medical Center. He was a donor for political 
causes and provided student scholarships for 
the Smittcamp Family Honors College at Fres-
no State, founded by Earl and Muriel 
Smittcamp. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Robert Earl ‘‘Bob’’ 
Smittcamp. He was a role model, leader and 
a friend of mine. His influence will live on in 
the San Joaquin Valley for years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF MYRA LEIGH 
TOBIN 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the life of Myra Leigh Tobin, a 
Harned, Kentucky native. Her education and 
Christian values were the foundation of her 
life, and she became a trailblazer for women 
in the business world as well as a generous 
philanthropist. 
Myra was a proud University of Kentucky 
Wildcat 1962 graduate and was named to the 
UK Hall of Distinguished Alumni in 2000. As a 
UK loyalist, she served on the UK Alumni As-
sociation, UK Board of Trustees, and as a 
founding charter member of UK Women in 
Philanthropy. Notably, the Myra Leigh Tobin 
Chapel was constructed in the new UK 
HealthCare hospital with her generosity. Be-
fore her successful insurance career, Myra 
worked for U.S. Rep. William Natcher. Myra 
was a strong advocate of education and ob-
tained two master’s degrees. In New York, 
she rose up in the business world and be-
came involved in professional and community 
organizations. Myra was known as a ‘‘Woman 
of Firsts’’ through breaking barriers by becom-
ing the first woman in many positions, and she 
received several professional awards to reflect 
her achievements. She accomplished all of 
this while staying entrenched in her Breckin-
ridge County roots. 
Myra’s generosity reached far beyond geo-
graphical borders, and she was determined to 
mentor family members, friends, and even 
strangers she encountered. Her leadership 
and generosity have made a lasting impact, 
and her legacy will live on.

CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF VALLE 
DEL SOL 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
Valle del Sol Community Health, which the or-
ganization celebrated in 2020. For the past 
fifty years Valle del Sol has inspired positive 
change by empowering people to live healthy, 
productive lives. 
Founded in 1970, Valle del Sol’s original 
mission was to make behavioral health and 
social services more available and accessible 
to the Latino community and other under-
served populations. Today, Valle del Sol’s 
services range from primary health care to 
substance abuse treatment and youth leader-
ship programs, all with a focus on providing 
culturally competent and holistic care. Valle 
del Sol has now grown to eight locations 
across the Phoenix area and 50 school and 
community co-locations to provide services to 
people where they learn, work, and live. 
The coronavirus pandemic presented an un-
precedented challenge to Valle del Sol, which 
they quickly rose to meet. The amazing team 
at Valle del Sol has been working tirelessly for 
over a year to test and, now, vaccinate high- 
risk individuals and frontline workers against 
COVID–19. Their work helps protect not only 
their patients, but the entire Phoenix commu-
nity. 
I wish to congratulate Valle del Sol and 
thank them for their work to make our commu-
nity healthier, happier, and more empowered. 
I look forward to continuing to work with this 
outstanding organization.

HONORING AND RECOGNIZING 
SYLVIA COPELAND-MURPHY 
HON. DONALD A. McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and recognize my Constituent 
Services Director, Rev. Sylvia Copeland-Mur-
phy, for her devoted service to her church, 
Oak Grove Baptist Church, in Suffolk, Virginia, 
where she has served as the Assistant Pastor 
for the last 18 years. 
Sylvia was born and raised in Suffolk, Vir-
ginia. She was one of seven children in her 
family and attended public school in the Suf-
folk area. Sylvia has dedicated her life to serv-
ing as a voice for the underprivileged through 
her work on housing assistance, with Oak 
Grove Baptist Church, and as Constituent 
Services Director for Virginia’s Fourth Con-
gressional District. 
I was blessed with the opportunity to meet 
Sylvia on the campaign trail in 2016. She has 
an infectious, kind personality that draws peo-
ple towards her, and has been an irreplace-
able member of my team. 
Through her work at her church, Sylvia has 
supported her community by leading youth 
groups, women’s ministries, and workshops. 
These initiatives showcase Sylvia’s deep care 
for her community and her devotion to Oak 
Grove Baptist Church. I knew early on that her 
dedication to supporting her community would 
be a great asset to my office. 
With Sylvia’s support, the first congressional 
office in the city of Suffolk opened and she 
continued to serve her community through her 
role as a caseworker, and eventually, as Con-
stituent Services Director. Her compassion, 
diligence, and organization made her a natural 
fit for the position, one of the hardest jobs in 
any congressional office. Through her particu-
larly impressive background in housing and 
devotion to her community, Sylvia has been 
able to provide immeasurable support to the 
people in Virginia’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Sylvia has a knack for finding the source of 
a problem and fixing it. With her passion, em-
pathy, and intelligence, Sylvia is a powerful 
leader and successful advocate for her com-
munity. Sylvia’s dedication to public service 
has left a lasting impact on the lives of the pa-
rishioners of Oak Grove Baptist Church and 
the Suffolk community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Rev. Sylvia Copeland-Mur-
phy for her service to her community and Oak 
Grove Baptist Church.

HONORING 
SYLVIA 
GETMAN, 
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ADI-

HEALTH, 
ON 
HER 
WELL-DESERVED RETIREMENT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Sylvia Getman on the occasion 
of her retirement from Adirondack Health as 
President and CEO. 
Sylvia has dedicated her life to providing 
healthcare services, spending the last thirty 
years in leadership positions. Prior to leading 
Adirondack Health for the last five years, Syl-
via served as the President and CEO of the 
Aroostook Medical Center in Maine. She has 
faced unprecedented challenges in the face of 
the global COVID–19 pandemic and was still 
able to bring about meaningful change to the 
hospital. Her hard work, energy, and passion 
will be greatly missed. Thanks to her perse-
verance and creative problem solving, Sylvia 
is leaving Adirondack Health in a better posi-
tion than she found it and all the stronger for 
having weathered the recent public health cri-
sis. 
Sylvia truly cares for the community she 
serves. Beyond her day job, she is a volunteer 
member of many boards, including Adiron-
dacks Accountable Care Organization, Iro-
quois Healthcare Association, the Healthcare 
Trustees of New York State, and the Adiron-
dack Health Institute. All done with the intent 
and focus of helping others, Sylvia has saved 
many lives working behind the scenes to en-
sure patients received the best care possible 
and that her staff had the resources needed to 
care for themselves and their patients. Sylvia 
truly embodies the North Country spirit of 
neighbors helping neighbors, and she is very 
well-deserving of her upcoming retirement. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate Sylvia on 
reaching this important milestone. Sylvia has 
left a significant impact on our community and 
her work has been extremely impactful on Adi-
rondack Health. I wish her well in this next 
chapter of her life.

HONORING MULTIRACIAL 
HERITAGE WEEK 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize June 7–14, 2021, as Multiracial Her-
itage Week, a celebration for all people. This 
week highlights our similarities, not our dif-
ferences. 
Multiracial Heritage Week is an opportunity 
to celebrate the contributions and achieve-
ments of the multiracial community. Multiracial 
individuals are not only parts of other popu-
lations, but they are also a growing population 
in and of itself. 
There are over 9.3 million individuals who 
self-identify as more than one race, which is 
the fastest growing population in the nation. 
According to the Pew Research Center, the 
largest groups of individuals identified them-
selves as white-American Indian, white-Asian, 
white-black, and white-some other race. The 
Census Bureau estimates the multiracial popu-
lation will triple by 2060. 
California is home to the largest multiracial 
population in our country. In the Central Val-
ley, diversity is one of our greatest strengths. 
Many people have come together to educate 
our communities, spread awareness, and cele-
brate their heritage during this important week. 
Multiracial Heritage Week was started by 
Project 
Reclassify 
All 
Children 
Equally 
(RACE), a national nonprofit and all-volunteer 
organization based in Los Banos, CA. It advo-
cates for multiracial children, adults, and fami-
lies through multiracial education and commu-
nity awareness. 
Project RACE was founded by Susan Gra-
ham and Chris Ashe in 1991. Both Susan and 
Chris had multiracial children, who experi-
enced problems with forms that did not allow 
an option of choosing more than one race or 
a Multiracial classification. 
As a result, Graham and representatives of 
Project RACE testified five times before the 
U.S. Congress and advocated for the imple-
mentation of multiracial classification. Subse-
quently, the checking of more than one box on 
federal agency and census forms was estab-
lished. Therefore, Multiracial people are known 
as ‘‘people who check two or more races’’ by 
our United States government. 
The organization is committed to advocating 
for civil rights and the appropriate inclusion of 
Multiracial people. The current struggle for ra-
cial justice is multifaceted and takes place on 
many fronts. I am proud to see this organiza-
tion and my constituents rise up to advocate 
for equal rights and celebrate diversity. 
Progress is made through the efforts of cou-
rageous individuals who actively engage within 
their communities and advocate for the rights 
of others. The people of the Central Valley 
have continuously shown that diversity is our 
strength and unity is our power. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker. 
I apologize for missing votes on June 25. I 
was meeting with the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs in Louisiana to discuss issues impact-
ing veterans in my district. Had I been 
present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call 
No. 185.

IN HONOR OF DAVID BLUFORD 
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of my late constituent, friend, 
and mentor, David Bluford. David lived a life 
dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, and to 
the betterment of the people around him. He 
was a husband, father, writer, educator, schol-
ar, and a leader to his community. 
While so many people might spend their 
lives and careers scrambling for wealth or 
power, David was the embodiment of a public 
servant. In his decades as an educator, he 
served as a college professor, high school 
principal, junior high school teacher and the 
director of the Upward Bound program at 
Queens College. David’s colleagues remem-
ber how fervently he advocated for the stu-
dents. His students remember him for the way 
he guided them towards wisdom, and towards 
greater versions of themselves. 
As a young man and throughout his life, 
David sought out opportunities to develop him-
self in all aspects. He was inducted into the 
Fayetteville State University Basketball Hall of 
Fame and served in the Korean War. He stud-
ied Education and Political Philosophy at five 
different colleges including Walden College 
and Columbia University, ultimately earning 
his PhD. 
David was also a talented writer. He wrote 
for papers including the New York Voice, New 
York Daily News, and the National Association 
of Secondary Principals, where he wrote a 
guide for new principals preparing to work in 
underserved communities, as he did during his 
career. Though he was an excellent leader, 
David didn’t treat education like a strict hier-
archy, rather an exchange. He never stopped 
learning, and he inspired other educators 
around him to continue to learn, too. He treat-
ed his students with dignity. 
One of David’s favorite quotes, said by Con-
fucius, was ‘‘Choose the job you love, and you 
will never work a day in your life.’’ What David 
loved was service. He didn’t just have a com-
munity-oriented career, but a community-ori-
ented lifestyle. He was Chairman of the Alpha 
Phi Alpha Senior Citizens Center in Queens, 
and a recipient of countless awards—including 
New York City School District 29’s Distin-
guished Service Award, the Outstanding Edu-
cator Award from the NAACP’s board in Ja-
maica, New York, the Jackie Robinson Junior 
High School Man of the Year Award. He par-
ticipated in several service-oriented organiza-
tions including the Urban League, the Leb-
anon Lodge of Jamaica, and 32 Degree Shrin-
er. 
David’s wife of 62 years, Renee, their chil-
dren, and their grandchildren all remember his 
devotion to his family, his warm heart, and his 
graceful nature towards humanity. As a hus-
band, a father, and a grandfather, he leaves 
an everlasting mark on those who were so 
blessed to know him. 
In all aspects of his life, David Bluford was 
authentic. When the opportunity presented 
itself to help someone else, to share knowl-
edge, or to be a resource, he seized that op-
portunity. Few fields let us serve our commu-
nities as directly as education does. David 
taught more than just English or Philosophy— 
he taught character. In being such a brilliant 
example to his students and fellow community 
members, David inspired change in countess 
lives. 
When he as just 17 years old, David con-
verted to Catholicism and so began a new re-
lationship with his faith. Through his life and 
works, David shared his faith in God with his 
family and friends. We know that David’s faith 
guided more than just his thoughts or words 
but his actions too. Few verses capture that 
like Isaiah 58:10—‘‘If you pour yourself out for 
the hungry and satisfy the desire of the af-
flicted, then shall your light rise in the dark-
ness and your gloom be as the noonday.’’ Da-
vid’s life work is the embodiment of this scrip-
ture. His life philosophy was one of cognitive, 
academic, emotional, and spiritual develop-
ment. Not just for himself or for his students, 
but for every person in his life. All of us, as 
public servants ourselves, can learn from his 
example.

HONORING THOMAS B. DAY 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize and celebrate the life and accomplish-
ments of Thomas B. Day, who passed away 
on June 15, 2021. 
Day dedicated over 30 years of his abun-
dant life to higher education and paved the 
way for thousands of students to achieve their 
academic and professional goals. Among 
Day’s numerous accomplishments in aca-
demia, public service, and science include ap-
pointments to the National Science Board by 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. 
Bush and receipt of the Senior Fellow and Fel-
low titles, respectively, from the California 
Council on Science and Technology and the 
American Physical Society. Serving as Presi-
dent of San Diego State University (SDSU) 
from 1978  1996, Day oversaw the creation of 
six doctoral programs and a strategic shift that 
emphasized faculty-intensive research. 
Referred to as one of the most trans-
formative presidents in the history of SDSU, 
under his guidance, the SDSU campus signifi-
cantly expanded, as he created a path for 
what is now California State University San 
Marcos, the SDSU School of Public Health, 
and the SDSU School of Communication. A 
credit to Day’s vision, SDSU School of Public 
Health now produces 75 percent of the public 
health work force in San Diego. 
Day’s legacy continues to be recognized. In 
2018, SDSU named the school’s engineering 
and interdisciplinary sciences complex the 
‘‘Thomas B. and Anne K. Day Quad’’ in his 
honor. 
Additionally, SDSU’s freshman success pro-
grams are now called the ‘‘Thomas B. Day 
Student Success Programs’’ to reflect Day’s 
advocacy for ensuring that students had ac-
cess to services that could support and enrich 
their learning opportunities. 
These accolades reflect Day’s strong dedi-
cation to SDSU and his deep hope for the 
continuous betterment of our community. 
While we mourn the loss of an extraordinary 
leader in our community, we can find joy in 
the fact that Day’s legacy will continue to en-
rich the lives of generations of Californians to 
come.

CELEBRATING THE 22ND ANNIVER-
SARY OF CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY 
BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate Christian Community Baptist 
Church in Fresno, California on the occasion 
of its 22nd anniversary. The church is a valu-
able part of the community and plays an im-
portant role in the spiritual lives of citizens in 
the Central Valley. 
In February 1996, approximately 15 people 
left the Providence Missionary Baptist Church 
under the leadership of Deacon Elvey Perkins. 
During this time, the group held meetings and 
worship services at Denny’s Restaurant on 
Abby Avenue to begin planning their future. In 
March 1996, this group began meeting at the 
Model Cities Building in Fraternal Hall. During 
this time the lay leaders of the group invited 
several ministers to preach God’s Word. 
These consisted of four ordained Deacons, 
two Deacons on trial, and several Trustees. 
One of the local ministers invited to preach 
God’s word was Dr. Jerome E. Jackson, In-
terim Pastor of the St. Rest Missionary Baptist 
Church of Fresno. After several business 
meetings, the group decided to form a con-
gregation and to name it ‘‘Christian Commu-
nity Church’’. In April 1997, the church mem-
bership called Reverend Dr. Jackson to be-
come the Pastor. Dr. Jackson accepted the 
pastorate and the first church service was held 
on April 20, 1997. Since then the Christian 
Community Baptist Church has built a model 
for the community of faith extending God’s 
Kingdom spiritually, educationally, economi-
cally, evangelistically, and geographically. 
Under the leadership of Dr. Jackson, the 
newly formed Christian Community Baptist 
Church of Fresno, California filed for incorpo-
ration as a non-profit tax-exempt religious or-
ganization and received approval on June 1, 
1998. In 1999, the newly incorporated Church 
moved from the Model Cities Building in Fra-
ternal Hall to the New Millennium Charter 
School building. Almost immediately after 
being organized, the church connected itself

with the St. John District Association of Cali-
fornia, Nevada, and parts of Africa. In March 
2000, Christian Community Church purchased 
the building at 3838 N. West Avenue. 
In 2005, Pastor Jackson united the church 
with the First Northern Central District Asso-
ciation of California, Nevada, and parts of Afri-
ca. Pastor Jackson served as Bible teacher, 
Vice-Executive Director, Member of the Board 
of Christian Education, Vice Moderator, and as 
Moderator of the First Northern Central District 
Association for over 5 years. With strong lead-
ership, the last 22 years have been tremen-
dously transformative for Christian Community 
Baptist Church. As they continue to grow and 
prosper, their effects in the community have 
helped too. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Christian Community Baptist 
Church as it celebrates its 22nd Anniversary. 
I commend Christian Community Baptist 
Church for its 22 years of commitment to serv-
ice and I wish Dr. Jackson and the church 
many more years of service.

POSITION ON THE METHANE RULE 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I was unable to take part in debating and vot-
ing on the revocation of the previous adminis-
tration’s rule governing methane emissions 
due to meetings with the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs to address long-overlooked 
issues impacting South Louisiana’s veterans. 
The Baton Rouge VA outpatient clinic in my 
district is undersized and not well suited to the 
needs of the Capital Region’s veterans. Mul-
tiple administrations have highlighted the need 
to authorize a new lease—but it hasn’t hap-
pened and getting veterans timely access to 
quality health care remains a top priority for 
me. 
Had I been in Washington, D.C., I would 
have voted against S.J. Res 14 to repeal the 
‘‘Oil and Natural Gas Standards for New, Re-
constructed, and Modified Sources Review.’’ 
We cannot afford to move backwards on 
President Trump’s policies that put American 
energy first. 
I support efforts to reduce methane emis-
sions. I support smart regulations that result in 
reducing methane emissions. But I do not sup-
port an approach that results in stifling innova-
tion and creates barriers to cost-effectively re-
ducing methane emissions. 
The United States has led the world in re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions and invest-
ing in innovation that will ensure continued re-
ductions in emissions here and around the 
world. We produce resources and goods with 
a carbon profile envied around the world—that 
includes oil and gas. As global demand in-
creases, as it is projected to do for natural 
gas, America should be supplying that de-
mand. Especially if you care about global 
emissions and climate change. 
With the deployment of innovative tech-
nologies, the use of our resources will become 
even cleaner. That’s why we need a regime 
that encourages innovation and incentivizes 
the development and deployment of tech-
nologies to mitigate and monitor methane 
emissions. Putting up barriers or making U.S. 
production of resources more expensive will 
drive up global emissions because it gives the 
competitive advantage in the global market to 
higher emitting resources—like those coming 
from Russia and China. 
This CRA is not about reducing methane 
emissions, it’s not about climate change, and 
it isn’t about national security. It is solely about 
reducing energy choices. Moreover, this is 
about regulating an entire sector of the U.S. 
economy out of business. The majority is not 
shy about stating their goal—whether through 
an outright ban or death by a thousand cuts. 
And what is most insidious is that the anti- 
American oil and gas agenda doesn’t apply to 
fossil energy outside the United States. 
In fact, their actions benefit and subsidize 
fossil energy in other countries. You don’t 
have to believe me, just look at their actions: 
we’ve seen cheers when the administration 
stops the construction of pipelines at home, 
actions which cost thousands of jobs for 
American families, reduce our energy security, 
and ultimately result in higher global emis-
sions. Democrats sat on their hands as Presi-
dent Biden green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line to carry natural gas from Russia to our al-
lies in Europe—resulting in a stronger Putin 
and higher global emissions than if the United 
States had supplied that energy. 
The majority voted against an amendment 
condemning the Russia action and Russian 
pipeline. Emissions never factored into their 
vote. In fact, Russian natural gas exported to 
Europe has a lifecycle greenhouse gas emis-
sion profile at least 42 percent higher than 
U.S. liquefied natural gas exported to Europe 
from Louisiana. Their singular intent was to re-
duce demand for an American resource by in-
creasing the supply of Russian natural gas to 
our allies. 
At home, their opposition to pipelines has 
resulted in increased use of higher-emitting 
heating oil and the importing of significantly 
higher-emitting natural gas from Russia. And 
while opposing lower emission production in 
America, progressives have called for in-
creased oil production in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Ara-
bia, Venezuela, and Russia. 
Don’t believe me? Let me read a quote from 
a letter signed by several members of the cur-
rent majority to President Trump in 2018: 
‘‘Today we call on you to use all of your au-
thority to . . . pressure the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 
cooperating countries to Increase World Oil 
Supplies.’’ That letter was signed by, among 
others, the current Leader of the Senate, 
CHUCK SCHUMER, and the author of the Green 
New Deal, ED MARKEY—the same crowd who 
advocated for banning American production of 
oil, American pipelines, and regulating out of 
existence any remaining American oil and gas. 
If this were about emissions, they wouldn’t be 
advocating for increased production from high-
er polluting countries while reducing produc-
tion from the more carbon efficient United 
States. 
Members of the majority have repeatedly 
voted against amendment after amendment 
that would have halted action if the action 
would result in increased global emissions. Let 
me say that again, they voted against lower 
emissions. I know because they were my 
amendments. It doesn’t end there: in the infra-
structure bill which we are set to consider next 
week, there is a designation of ‘‘high per-
forming’’ states based on climate policies. We 
offered an amendment during committee 
markup that would remove that designation if 
those same policies resulted in a dispropor-
tionate negative impact on disadvantaged 
communities. This amendment was voted 
down. Under the current text of the Invest Act, 
states that are being sued by civil rights 
groups for climate policies that hurt disadvan-
taged communities will be rewarded . 
They have voted against amendments that 
would have clamped down on child labor in 
Africa and slave labor in China, because it’s 
inconsistent with the progressive anti-U.S. en-
ergy agenda. For every ton of emissions re-
duced by the United States, China has in-
creased its emissions by 4 tons—and yet, poli-
cies coming from the other side will export 
jobs to China, increase global emissions, and 
increase American dependence on China. 
Again, don’t believe me? Let me read from 
a report put out by the Senate Democrats’ Cli-
mate Committee: ‘‘As we institute domestic 
decarbonization policies that increase overall 
production costs . . . we could see U.S. com-
panies shift their production to countries that 
are less restrictive on carbon emissions . . . 
This will not only lead to an increase in total 
global emissions, but also the outsourcing of 
American jobs.’’ And they haven’t included a 
single policy in any of their climate bills to 
counteract this result of outsourcing American 
jobs and increasing global emissions. Is it any 
wonder why we question their motives for this 
action today? 
There is a way to effectively address meth-
ane emissions without costing jobs and in-
creasing global emissions. I am on board with 
that discussion. But it isn’t about that. It’s 
about one more of the thousand cuts to de-
stroy American jobs, reduce American com-
petitiveness, and increase global emissions.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
LORETTA 
CANNON’S OVER 40 YEARS OF 
SERVICE

HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE 
WILLIAM WHITMORE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of George William Whitmore, 
who passed away on January 1, 2021. 
George was a veteran of the United States Air 
Force, a husband, friend, and a man who 
loved adventures with nature. 
George was born on February 8, 1931 in 
Fresno, California to Raymond and Jean 
Whitmore. His father was a Marine during 
WWII and became a stockbroker when he got 
out of the service. His mother worked for Pa-
cific Gas & Electric. During the Great Depres-
sion, the family moved to the Central Valley. 
George attended Salinas High School and de-
cided to study at University of California, San 
Francisco earning a degree in 1954 as a 
Pharmacist. During his spare time, George en-
joyed climbing and later decided to join the Air 
Force in the medical evacuation unit as an 
aeromedical evacuation officer. 
After the Air Force, he decided to continue 
working as a pharmacist, but in the summer, 
he would spend his time hiking and climbing. 
George climbed the Andes in Peru and El Ca-
pitan at Yosemite with his friends, Warren 
Harding and Wayne Merry. He served in lead-
ership roles for the Sierra Club, and served as 
a Chairman for the Tehipite Chapter based in 
Fresno, California. 
George helped establish the Kaiser Wilder-
ness in 1976 and the California Wilderness 
Act of 1984, which added 1.8 million acres 
into the National Wilderness Preservation Sys-
tem. He helped protect lakes and block dam 
projects and highways and also helped pre-
vent Walt Disney Co. from developing a pro-
posed ski resort at Mineral King in the 1960s 
and ’70s. It was stopped after sustained oppo-
sition by the Sierra Club and other preserva-
tionists, and the valley subsequently became 
part of Sequoia National Park. 
George battled cancer with his wife Nancy 
by his side. He and Nancy were together for 
over 40 years and were each other’s best 
friend. George never lost his love for adven-
ture. He enjoyed visiting with friends and he 
still participated in the Sierra Club meetings, 
continuing to educate people on the impor-
tance of preservation. 
He is survived by his wife, Nancy, niece 
Caroline and husband Bob, nephew Randy 
and his wife Betty. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of George William 
Whitmore for his service and contributions to 
the environment that surrounds us. I join his 
family and friends in celebrating George’s life.

IN HONOR OF DOCTOR EDMUND W. 
ROBB III 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the career and community service of 
Doctor Edmund W. Robb III, Senior Pastor of 
The Woodlands United Methodist Church. 
Dr. Robb will be retiring as Senior Pastor of 
The Woodlands United Methodist Church after 
43 years of honorable service. Before begin-
ning his career with the church, Dr. Robb 
earned his Master of Theology from The Per-
kins School of Theology at Southern Methodist 
University. In 1978, Dr. Robb was appointed 
to start a new Methodist church in his growing 
community and began knocking on doors in 
the neighborhood to recruit members. The 
church was born when The Woodlands was 
just a budding community of young families, 
but under Dr. Robb’s leadership, it has grown 
to over 14,000 members. 
Dr. Robb is not only recognized today for 
his 43 years as an impactful pastor, but also 
for his dedicated service to The Woodlands 
community. He spent 20 years serving as an 
elected official of The Woodlands Township 
and its predecessor, Town Center Improve-
ment District (TCID). Alongside State Senator 
Tommy Williams, he led the way in negotiating 
the agreement that would allow The Wood-
lands to become a Township. He was an in-
strumental guide in leading the TCID in 
partnering with private developers to build the 
Convention Center, develop Town Green Park 
and expand The Woodlands Waterway. Dr. 
Robb has also authored several published 
books, including ‘‘The Wonder of Christmas,’’ 
‘‘Under Wraps,’’ ‘‘Mountaintop Moments’’ and 
‘‘Making Room: Sharing the Love of Christ-
mas.’’ His commitment to our community has 
left a positive impact that will continue to influ-
ence The Woodlands area for generations. 
Today, Dr. Robb continues to serve the 
community on the board of the Houston Meth-
odist Hospital and as board Chairman of ‘‘A 
Foundation for Theological Education.’’ He 
and his wife, Bev, are parents to three married 
children and grandparents to eight grand-
children. Though he is retiring, he will remain 
actively engaged as a leader in his community 
and a calming voice of reason to those around 
him. 
After 43 years of exceptional work and serv-
ice to our community, I am proud to join Dr. 
Robb’s colleagues, family and friends in con-
gratulating him on his retirement and thanking 
him for all that he has done for our commu-
nity. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA CLEMENCY HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Clemency 
Home Rule Act, which would give the District 
of Columbia exclusive authority, like the states 
and territories have, to grant clemency to of-
fenders prosecuted under its local laws. 
While District law appears to give the mayor 
authority to grant clemency (D.C. Code 1–301. 
76), it has been the opinion of the Department 
of Justice (DOJ) that the president, and not 
the mayor, has the authority to grant clemency 
for most offenses prosecuted under D.C. law, 
particularly felonies prosecuted by the U.S. At-
torney for D.C. in the D.C. Superior Court. 
Under current practice, clemency petitions for 
D.C. convictions, like federal convictions, are 
submitted to DOJ for the president’s consider-
ation. 
Whether or not DOJ’s view is correct, my 
bill would remove all doubt that the District, 
and not the president, has the authority to 
issue clemency for local offenses. The District, 
like the states and territories, should have full 
control of its local criminal justice system, the 
most basic responsibility of local government. 
Since the D.C. Council has the authority to 
enact local laws, District officials are in the 
best position to grant clemency for local law 
convictions. My bill would provide clemency 
authority to the District and would give D.C. 
the discretion to establish its own clemency 
system. 
This bill is an important step in establishing 
further autonomy for the District. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill.

IN MEMORY OF PRITAM GREWAL 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Pritam Singh 
Grewal, one of North Jersey’s most compas-
sionate community leaders. Raised in India, 
Pritam immigrated directly to the Fifth District 
in 1972 and dedicated himself to our commu-
nity ever since. He was truly an unselfish and 
deeply caring man who made an impact on 
everyone who crossed his path. 
As a founding member of Glen Rock’s Sikh 
Gurudwara, Pritam helped build a safe space 
for North Jersey’s Sikh community to come to-
gether and worship. Having personally visited 
several times, I can attest to the special at-
mosphere he instilled in this important Glen 
Rock establishment. 
Pritam always felt a calling to promote qual-
ity education throughout his community. He 
taught mechanical engineering at Fairleigh 
Dickinson University, and later partnered with 
his brother, Amarjit, to establish the Grewal, 
Harchand Singh and Jagir Kaur Memorial 
Scholarship of Ramapo College, in memory of 
his late parents. 
Pritam was also widely known throughout

the trauma team took care of him after an ac-
cident in 2012. He even has an award named 
in his honor, the Pritam Singh Grewal Good 
Samaritan Award, to recognize outstanding 
staff at Hackensack who share his sense of 
compassion and dedication to service. 
A loving husband, father, and grandfather, 
Pritam cared deeply about his family. He was 
loved and cherished by many people including 
his spouse Paramjit Kaur Grewal and his chil-
dren Shivpreet and Balpreet. I join them not 
only in their grief and in celebration of Pritam’s 
incredible life. 
While Pritam is no longer with us, his spirit, 
legacy, and impact on North Jersey will live on 
forever. I know his loving family will continue 
to honor him by leading the kind of life that he 
did—one grounded in compassion, service, 
and an understanding of the importance of lift-
ing up one’s community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF S. 
CHARANJIT SINGH 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. S. Charanjit Singh, who 
passed away on May 12, 2021. He was a suc-
cessful family and business man and member 
of the Central Valley with his children and 
wife. 
Mr. Singh was born in India in 1950 and 
came to the United States in 1988 from 
Ludhiana, Punjab. He and his family settled in 
Los Angeles, California managing multiple 
convenience stores. He was a hard worker 
and provided for his two sons, daughter, and 
his wife. In 2003, Mr. Singh decided to move 
his family to Fresno, California. 
Living in the Central Valley, Mr. Singh flour-
ished his businesses. He was a business 
owner of purchased and newly built stores. 
Mr. Singh had over 30 gas stations and liquor 
stores. He could prioritize his time, manage 
multiple stores, and have time for his family. 
Mr. Singh would attend many events in the 
Central Valley including many of my own and 
he would often share his wisdom about the 
Sikh community to me. 
Mr. Singh is survived by his beloved wife, 
Darshan Kaur; two sons Navjeet Chahal and 
Baljit Singh Chahal; daughter Parampreet 
Kaur, and his six grandchildren. Mr. Singh will 
be missed by the community and his friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in 
celebrating the life of Mr. S. Charanjit Singh. 
I join his family, friends, and the community in 
celebrating his great life.

IN HONOR OF ARCHIE SPIGNER 
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to the honorable life of Archie Spigner, 
whom I will remember as a distinguished con-
stituent, friend, and mentor. Archie was and 
will always be my Jackie Robinson. The road 
for Black political leaders in my district, in 
Queens and in New York City is a much 
smoother one today because Archie paved 
that road for us. However, metaphorical roads 
were not the only ones he dedicated his life 
to. 
Archie knew the streets of Southeast 
Queens better than anyone I’ve ever met. As 
a public servant for over 20 years, Archie 
spent his career building better roads, as well 
as better schools, train lines, senior programs, 
housing programs, and sewers. It was often 
said that the roads to public office in our 
neighborhoods ran through Archie. His life 
was truly dedicated to our community, and his 
accomplishments are evidence. 
Born in South Carolina during the height of 
Jim Crow and segregation, Archie leaves this 
Earth as the godfather of politics in Queens 
and boasts several Black elected officials in-
cluding myself that called him ‘‘mentor’’. 
While studying parliamentary procedure he 
became a steward at a shoe factory which led 
to his career advocating for the common work-
er. As a labor organizer, he met A. Philip Ran-
dolph, one of the principal architects of the 
March on Washington. He founded the 
Queens Branch of the Negro American Labor 
Council right out of his living room. His work 
as an organizer put him in close contact with 
his political mentors including Assembly Mem-
ber Guy R. Brewer and State Supreme Court 
Justice Kenneth Browne. 
While attending Queens College of the City 
of University of New York where he would 
earn his bachelor’s degree, he worked as the 
liaison to the African American community for 
Queens Borough President Sidney Leviss. 
Soon after the New York City Council was ex-
panded, Archie was elected to represent the 
27th District, where he would go on to serve 
for 27 years. During his tenure, he chaired 
three committees: The Legislative Office of 
Budget Review, Economic Development, and 
Housing and Buildings. His work with the 
budget review office led to the creation of the 
ever-important independent budget office. He 
also championed some of the borough’s first 
Business Improvement Districts and Minority 
and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Pro-
grams while on the Economic Development 
Committee. 
Somehow he managed to have ‘‘free’’ time 
and spent it serving as Deputy Majority Leader 
and Co-Chair of the Queens Delegation. Ar-
chie spent every moment he could helping his 
community and his accomplishments are all 
over Queens. He established mandatory sen-
sitivity trainings for every police precinct in the 
city. He helped create York College, along 
with many new middle and high schools. He 
codified protections against red lining and 
worked on a number of infrastructure projects, 
including the incorporation of the E train ex-
tension, new sewers, street rehabilitation, and 
the New Social Security building. The sys-
temic problems being grappled by this House 
today were no strangers to Archie, and he 
dedicated a career in public office to alle-
viating those burdens that continuously plague 
underserved communities. Mostly, however, 
Archie just wanted to help his neighbors. 
Before I first ran for Congress, Archie told 
me, ‘‘make sure you always help people, be 
honest with people, and stay on the ground.’’ 
After his tenure as a City Council Member, Ar-
chie went back to his neighborhood and be-
came a district leader in the Queens County 
Democratic Party and was head of the Guy R. 
Brewer United Democratic Club, named after 
his old mentor. Cementing his mark on the 
community, I introduced a bill in 2004 to re-
name a St. Albans post office after him, which 
at the time, was the only commemoration of 
its kind to be ever given to a living person. At 
the commemorating ceremony, schoolchildren 
sang, ‘‘if Archie Spigner works for you, clap 
your hands,’’ which was a line greeted with 
roaring applause. 
The Book of Matthew tells us that ‘‘when the 
Son of Man comes in his glory,’’ he will sit on 
his throne and judge both the living and the 
dead, saying the following to those who are to 
be saved: ‘‘Come, you who are blessed by my 
Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom 
prepared for you since the creation of the 
world. For I was hungry and you gave me 
something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave 
me something to drink, I was a stranger and 
you invited me in, I needed clothes and you 
clothed me, I was sick and you looked after 
me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’’ 
I do not find it difficult to imagine what kind of 
person from our time will be destined to join 
in God’s glory. I have had the pleasure of 
knowing someone so vehemently dedicated to 
improving the lives of their fellow man. That 
person was Archie Spigner. He pursued crimi-
nal justice and equities in economic and hous-
ing opportunities that demonstrated a passion 
for loving his neighbor as he would himself. 
He worked for reform in his community so that 
more could prosper and share in the promise 
of this country. He was both an idol American 
and Christian, and it is an honor to have 
known him.

CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL 
OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS PARK 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to commemorate the centennial of Frederick 
Douglass Park in Indianapolis. This historic 
park honors the memory and legacy of leg-
endary abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Lo-
cated in the Martindale-Brightwood neighbor-
hood on the east side of Indianapolis and 
maintained by the City of Indianapolis’s parks 
department, the Frederick Douglass Park has 
been an integral part of our city for genera-
tions by bringing our community together. 
The park’s history reflects America’s civil 
rights journey. It opened in 1921 in the Jim 
Crow era to serve Black citizens, as they were 
excluded or intimidated from visiting other rec-
reational spaces in Indianapolis. Black Hoo-
siers embraced the park, organizing and advo-
cating for its maintenance and improvement. 
Frederick Douglass Park is well known for its 
role in cultivating Black golfers, and it has 
hosted professionals such as Ted Rhodes, 
Charlie Sifford and Tiger Woods. Today, it is 
visited and appreciated by Hoosiers of many 
different backgrounds. 
Frederick Douglass Park continues to play 
an important role in Indianapolis, and in cele-
bration of its 100 years, our community is 
planning a series of events including a golf- 
tournament, festival, and movie night. The City 
of Indianapolis will additionally announce a
