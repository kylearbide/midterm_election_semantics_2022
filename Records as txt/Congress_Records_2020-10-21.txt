The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, whose love is from ever-
lasting to everlasting, we pray for our 
Nation during this season of critical 
decision making. Guide our citizens 
with Your wisdom and fill them with 
Your peace. 
Lord, in every generation, You con-

to our challenges and who strive to 
please You. Provide us with such lead-
ers that Your Name will be glorified as 
they strive to do Your will. 
Today, replace fear with faith, false-

that where You are, Your peace may 
abide with us all. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The Senate resumed consideration of 
the nomination of Michael Jay New-
man, of Ohio, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the Southern District of 
Ohio. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
to speak for 1 minute as in morning 
business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IOWA AGRICULTURE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa, 
my State, has a rich legacy in leading 
the Nation and the world in agriculture 
production and innovation. Iowa is 
first in corn production, first in eggs, 
ethanol, and pork, and second in soy-
beans. Family farms are the main in-
stitution for producing all this. So 
those family farms are how many 
Iowans leave their mark on our world, 
by passing their legacy to their chil-
dren. 
In the Senate, Senator ERNST and I 
have the great privilege of representing 
these family farmers. Senator ERNST 
and I have worked with the Trump ad-
ministration to make biofuels a pri-
ority. We have secured E15 year- 
round—15 billion gallons of ethanol are 
blended annually as the law requires— 
new ethanol infrastructure through the 
USDA, and secured an extension of the 
biodiesel tax credit. We have secured 
and expanded trade agreements with 
our largest trading partners, which add 
value to Iowan commodities. 
We also helped to put an end to the 
ridiculous Obama-era waters of the 
United States rule that would have 
regulated 97 percent of Iowa’s farmland 
as navigable waterway. Just as the 
harvest comes to an end, usually in No-
vember, our work will not stop in No-
vember. Senator ERNST and I will con-
tinue to focus on Iowa farm families 
and ensuring their success for years to 
come. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, the Senate will have an oppor-
tunity to advance another COVID–19 
relief package for American families. 
For more than 7 months now, the 
American people have been facing what 
one writer described as a ‘‘health crisis 
with an economic crisis strapped to its 
back.’’ 
The Senate has stepped up repeat-
edly, on a bipartisan basis, to help our 
Nation through this challenge. Today, 
we have an opportunity to do it once 
again. 
The legislation before us is neither 
Republicans’ nor Democrats’ idea of a 
perfect bill. I think we are all clear on 
that. But it would move us past Speak-
er PELOSI’s all-or-nothing obstruction 
and deliver huge support right now for 
the most pressing needs of our country. 
Republicans want to conquer this dis-
ease through testing, treatments, and 
vaccines. Democrats say they agree 
with us. 
Republicans want to pour money into 
safe schools and make sure an entire

S6338 
October 21, 2020 
generation of kids don’t fall any fur-
ther behind, and Democrats say they 
agree with that. 
Republicans want to reopen the Pay-
check Protection Program so that 
Main Streets across America don’t 
turn into COVID–19 ghost towns, so 
that millions of workers can keep their 
jobs and keep getting paid. Democrats 
say they agree with that. 
For workers who have been laid off, 
Republicans want to renew the Federal 
supplement to unemployment insur-
ance. Democrats say they agree with 
that. 
Republicans want to cement health 
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions, including COVID– 
19 itself. Democrats claim they are all 
over this issue. 
And Republicans want to take our 
Nation’s college presidents, nonprofit 
leaders, and employers at their word 
when they say they need commonsense 
protections so that legal uncertainty 
does not block their reopening. 
The bill on the floor would do every 
one of those things and much more. 
The overwhelming bulk of it are pro-
grams that Democrats claim they sup-
port. It turns out there is a special 
perk to being a Senator. When you ac-
tually support something, you get to 
vote for it. When you actually support 
something, you get to vote for it. When 
you actually want an outcome, you 
vote for it. 
Strangely enough, that is not what 
seems to be happening. Our Democratic 
colleagues have been happy to talk 
about further relief as long as it re-
mained a hypothetical concept. But 
every time the Senate has had a chance 
to actually do something, they said no. 
In July, Republicans tried to con-
tinue the Federal plus-up to unemploy-
ment insurance before it expired. Sen-
ator SCHUMER blocked it. In August, 
Senator MCSALLY fought again to re-
start those benefits for laid-off Ameri-
cans. Once again, Democrats stopped it 
cold. 
In September, Republicans wrote a 
sweeping proposal to deliver hundreds 
of billions of dollars for safe schools, 
unemployment benefits, paycheck pro-
tection, 
and 
the 
healthcare 
fight. 
Every single Senate Democrat voted to 
kill it all, except the junior Senator 
from California, who didn’t vote. 
This 
has 
been 
the 
dynamic 
for 
months now: Republicans trying to 
pass commonsense policies that the 
Democrats say they support and Demo-
crats replying that working people 
can’t get a dime unless Speaker PELOSI 
gets everything she wants. 
We are talking about silly stuff: mas-
sive tax cuts for rich people in blue 
States, stimulus checks for people in 
our country illegally, wheelbarrows of 
cash—out of any proportion to COVID– 
19 needs—for State and city govern-
ments 
that 
Democrats 
have 
mis-
managed for decades, and removing 
longstanding bipartisan Hyde protec-
tions that protect taxpayers from fund-
ing abortions. 
Now I hear they don’t want to renew 
the PPP unless it sends money to 
Planned Parenthood and criminals who 
are, literally, currently in prison. Let 
me say that again. They don’t want to 
renew PPP unless it sends money to 
Planned Parenthood and criminals who 
are, literally, currently in prison. 
These are the kinds of far-left fringe 
demands over which Democrats have 
blocked kitchen-table assistance for 
American families and healthcare sup-
port to crush the virus. 
During this historic crisis, the Demo-
cratic leaders have elected to deny 
struggling people the help they need 
unless President Trump signs the en-
tire Democratic Party platform into 
law. 
Today, we are providing another 
chance to right the ship. In a few min-
utes, Senators will vote to either ad-
vance or filibuster a broad package 
that would deliver on all kinds of ur-
gent needs: testing, treatments, vac-
cines, safe schools for our kids, a sec-
ond round of the job-saving PPP, more 
Federal unemployment benefits, the 
legal protections that university presi-
dents and charities say they need, pro-
tections for preexisting conditions. 
There is almost nothing in this pro-
posal that Democrats even claim to op-
pose. 
Just last week, the entire country 
watched our colleagues on the Justice 
Committee complain over and over 
about having to fulfill those respon-
sibilities when they supposedly wanted 
to be working on a coronavirus relief 
package. We will see who walks the 
walk. 
I am confident the Democratic leader 
will repeat the same tired attacks he 
has been recycling since the summer-
time. He will say we shouldn’t do any-
thing unless we do everything. He will 
argue this multi-hundred-billion-dollar 
bill is paltry—$500 billion is paltry or 
meager or emaciated, a half trillion 
dollars? I am not kidding. This is seri-
ously their claim—that a half trillion 
dollars for working people is chump 
change. It is not worth their time. 
Hundreds of billions of dollars targeted 
directly to struggling people doesn’t 
even get Democrats out of bed in the 
morning. 
Well, perhaps, to the blue-State bil-
lionaires, who seem to be the Demo-
crats’ top priority, these historic sums 
of money do look like chump change. 
Maybe coastal elites who can prac-
tically find a million dollars in their 
couch cushions are indifferent about 
whether we get an outcome here. 
Well, believe me, working families 
like the Kentuckians I represent don’t 
see it that way. Millions of workers 
have been able to keep their jobs and 
support their families because of the 
Paycheck Protection Program. Repub-
licans want to fund a whole second 
round of that. Today, Democrats will 
either vote to advance it or vote to kill 
it. 
Students, teachers, and parents need 
to know their K–12 schools are as safe 
as possible. Republicans want to send a 
historic sum of money to those schools. 
Today, Democrats will either vote to 
advance it or vote to kill it. 
For the historic numbers of Ameri-
cans who have been laid off, additional 
Federal unemployment benefits have 
been a lifeline. Republicans want to re-
store them. Today, Democrats will ei-
ther vote to advance it or vote to kill 
it. 
Colleges, universities, charities, and 
small business need commonsense legal 
protections, and with cases spiking, 
our whole country needs further in-
vestment in testing, tracing, and vac-
cines. Today, the Democrats will either 
vote to advance all that or vote to kill 
it. 
Struggling people don’t need more 
endless arguments. They don’t need to 
keep waking up and listening to report-
ers speculate on whether the Speaker 
of the House is in a good mood that 
day, because their very livelihood may 
depend on it. The country needs an 
outcome. The country needs an out-
come. 
Let’s put aside our differences, agree 
where we can, and move forward. Why 
not get the country in a better place 
while Washington continues to argue 
over all the rest? If the sun sets today 
with no progress, if the Senate turns to 
Judge Barrett’s nomination without 
having advanced another historic res-
cue package, it will only be because 
Senate Democrats used the filibuster 
to kill this aid. 
If this relief does not pass, it will be 
because Senate Democrats chose to do 
Speaker PELOSI’s political dirty work 
rather than stand up for struggling 
people. Let’s not go there. Let’s find 
our common sense, agree where we can, 
and advance this legislation while we 
debate the rest. The American people 
deserve action. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—S. 178

sent that the mandatory quorum call

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
closer we get to an election, the sillier 
it gets here in Leader MCCONNELL’s 
Senate. All week, the Republican ma-
jority has scheduled stunt votes on 
supposed COVID relief bills that are 
all, in reality, designed to fail. 
Yesterday, the leader moved to table 
his own bill so the Republicans could 
vote against tabling it. Let me repeat 
that because that is what is happening 
here. It is hard to believe that this is 
supposedly the greatest debate Cham-
ber in the country or in the world. 
Leader MCCONNELL moved to table his 
own bill so the Republicans could then 
vote against tabling it. That is what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6339 
October 21, 2020 
the Republican majority thinks passes 
for a serious attempt at a COVID relief 
bill in this Republican Senate when 
people are suffering so badly—games, 
games when people are suffering. 
The truth is the Republican leader 
needed that vote to fail because, if the 
Senate actually proceeded to a real 
bill, it might mess up the timing of the 
Republican plan to confirm Judge Bar-
rett to the Supreme Court. Now, think 
of that for a moment. The Republican 
majority sets up a fake vote on COVID 
relief because if, God forbid, the Senate 
actually considered a real bill to do 
something 
real 
about 
this 
over-
whelming COVID crisis, it might delay 
their Supreme Court nominee they are 
rushing through in a process that can 
only be declared as abusive to the Sen-
ate. 
That is all the American people need 
to know about priorities on the other 
side of the aisle—rush through a nomi-
nee whose views are way to the right of 
the American people’s and ignore, 
avoid, and play games with getting 
COVID relief, which is the No. 1 thing 
the American people want, not a Su-
preme Court nominee who is so far 
away from their views. 
While the country is hurting, while 
millions of Americans are sick and 
dying, while workers lose their jobs, 
and while businesses close their doors, 
Republican Senators are playing polit-
ical stunts with vitally needed eco-
nomic relief, and the games continue 
today. Once again, the Republican ma-
jority will bring up a bill that is de-
signed to fail—its partisan, emaciated 
so-called COVID relief bill. The bill we 
are voting on today has already failed 
in the Senate. It didn’t get a Demo-
cratic vote. 
We already know it lacks the votes, 
and why? Because it leaves so many 
Americans behind. Renters and home-
owners are left behind. There is no re-
lief for them. Americans who have lost 
jobs through no fault of their own are 
left behind. Americans who rely on 
critical public services by their State 
and local governments are left behind. 
Small 
businesses, 
communities 
of 
color, and some of the hardest hit in-
dustries—our restaurants, our concert 
venues, theaters, nonprofits, and local 
news—receive no dedicated assistance. 
The Republican proposal on COVID 
doesn’t even devote enough resources 
to testing and tracing despite a spike 
in cases and the harrowing prospect of 
a second wave of the virus sweeping 
across America. It is laden with poison 
pills that our Republican colleagues 
know Democrats would never support. 
That is not an attempt to legislate and 
get something done. 
What is in there? There is a giant 
corporate immunity provision to shield 
corporations from liability if they put 
their workers in dangerous COVID-re-
lated situations, and there is a tax pro-
vision to benefit wealthy families who 
send their kids to private schools while 
shortchanging 
middle-class 
families 
and public schools. 
There is no reason for our Republican 
colleagues to insist on a corporate li-
ability shield and a provision to injure 
public schools in a COVID relief bill— 
no reason. They know it is objection-
able. They know it is partisan. They 
know it is an anchor around the mini-
mal bill they have—enough to sink it. 
There is no reason to include these poi-
son pills in legislation that they know 
needs bipartisan support to pass. Twen-
ty Republicans have said they don’t 
want to vote for any money, so they 
know they need the Democrats, but 
they have put things in the bill that 
they know the Democrats will oppose 
and will lead to the bill’s demise, this 
minimal bill. 
So what is the logic here? 
Well, there is a perverse logic if the 
Republican leader wants to make sure 
that the bill fails, and that is sure 
what it looks like. It is clear why 
Leader MCCONNELL
is forced to do 
these stunts—a good portion of his cau-
cus opposes more relief for the Amer-
ican people. 
Yesterday, the Republican whip, the 
member in charge of counting Repub-
lican votes, said: ‘‘I think we’re going 
to have a hard time finding 13 [Repub-
lican] votes for anything’’—13 out of 52, 
53. 
One 
Republican 
Member 
proudly 
vowed not to vote for ‘‘another dime.’’ 
People are being kicked out of their 
homes. Children are starving. There is 
no testing and tracing that meets the 
needs. Schools can’t open—and not an-
other dime. Let America suffer so our 
rightwing ideology—saying that we 
shouldn’t make well-to-do people pay 
taxes, which is what their last tax cut 
bill did—can prevail over the needs of 
America and the American people. 
So it is not the Democrats who are 
blocking a real relief bill. We know 
that. Everyone knows that. Speaker 
PELOSI is still trying her best with the 
White House to get a deal. We have al-
ready offered to meet the Republicans 
halfway. The biggest obstacles to an-
other relief bill from the very begin-
ning have been Senate Republicans and 
Leader MCCONNELL. 
Then, as if we needed any more 
proof—it was pretty obvious before—it 
was reported in multiple news outlets 
and confirmed by four Senators who 
were at the meeting that Leader 
MCCONNELL warned the White House 
against making another deal on an-
other stimulus bill before the election. 
Let me repeat that. Leader MCCON-
NELL, while he was coming to the floor 
and railing against Democratic ob-
struction, was behind the scenes, warn-
ing the White House against striking a 
bipartisan deal on COVID relief. 
Who does he think he can fool? Not 
the American people. Ask them. They 
know who is to blame. They know 
Democrats, up and down the line, are 
for relief and Republicans oppose it. I 
will tell you one thing: The American 
people are sick and tired of these polit-
ical stunts. They are sick and tired of 
politicians who would rather have it 
appear they are working than doing ac-
tual work. 
This shouldn’t be so hard. We all 
know how to pass bills in the Senate— 
with bipartisan buy-in and bipartisan 
support. We did it in the CARES bill 
back in March. Yet, ever since that bill 
passed this Senate, the Republican ma-
jority has gone totally partisan every 
step of the way, even on an issue as im-
portant to the country as relief from 
this evil pandemic. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. President, on the Supreme Court, 
the Republican leader has announced 
the Senate will vote next Monday on 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be a Su-
preme Court Justice, capping what will 
be the most rushed, most partisan, and 
least legitimate process in the entire 
history of Supreme Court nominations. 
Leader MCCONNELL continues to de-
file the Senate more than any other 
Senator has done in a very long time. 
Let us hope that Leader MCCONNELL 
hasn’t ruined the Senate for good with 
this nasty 180-degree turn, holding up 
Merrick Garland, and rushing this 
judge through while people are in line 
at the polling places. 
The idea ‘‘let’s wait for the next elec-
tion’’ was total hypocrisy—total hy-
pocrisy. 
The U.S. Senate has never—never— 
considered a Supreme Court Justice 
this close to a national Presidential 
election. I doubt it ever will again. I 
don’t think we will ever have the com-
bination of Donald Trump and Leader 
MCCONNELL, who so don’t care about 
what they said in the past—MCCONNELL 
anyway—who so don’t care about try-
ing to pick a Justice who will look at 
the law as opposed to ideological views. 
I hope it doesn’t happen again. I pray it 
doesn’t happen again. 
Just 4 years ago, we all know the Re-
publican leader, the former chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, the cur-
rent chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and nearly every single Repub-
lican Member argued that President 
Obama’s nominee didn’t deserve a hear-
ing or a vote on the floor of the Senate 
because there was a national election 8 
months away. 
Mere hours after the passing of Jus-
tice Scalia, Leader MCCONNELL said the 
American people deserve a voice in the 
selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice, not if one party or another 
party controlled the Presidency or the 
Senate. Absolute: The American people 
deserve a voice. That was 8 months 
from an election. 
Leader MCCONNELL confirmed yester-
day that the vote to confirm President 
Trump’s 
nominee 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court will take place 8 days before an 
election. 
Senate 
Republicans 
could 
wait 8 months to give the American 
people a voice in selecting a Supreme 
Court Justice; now they can’t wait 8 
days? 
I am sure that if they had to, the Re-
publican majority would confirm a Su-
preme Court Justice 8 minutes before 
election day. Is it no wonder that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6340 
October 21, 2020 
Democrats are so angry? Is it no won-
der that the American people are tear-
ing their hair out, when they have said 
they want to wait until the next elec-
tion, when that is only fair, that is 
only democratic? The hypocrisy is tow-
ering and enormous. And as I said, 
Leader MCCONNELL could destroy this 
Chamber for a very long time. 
Why is this happening? Well, this is 
part of a decade-long effort to shift the 
courts to the far right so that the far 
right, which has so many Republicans 
in their grasp, can accomplish through 
the judiciary what they could never ac-
complish through the Congress. 
Senate Republicans failed to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act. We know. 
That happened right here. So President 
Trump and Republican attorneys gen-
eral are suing to eliminate the law in 
court. 
Senate Republicans don’t dare put re-
peal of Roe v. Wade on the floor of the 
Senate. They know it would fail. But 
they try to appoint Justices who are 
dedicated to repealing that vital right 
of a woman to choose and to control 
her own body. 
This is just an amazing moment. One 
of Coney Barrett’s very first cases 
would be to hear arguments against 
the Affordable Care Act, the very act 
that this Chamber rejected repeal of. 
Republicans, as I said, could never re-
peal a woman’s right to choose in Con-
gress. They don’t even dare bring it to 
the floor. 
The far right has never had a major-
ity on the Court to limit Roe or Gris-
wold, but if Judge Barrett becomes 
Justice Barrett, it very well might. 
Women of America, watch out. Watch 
out. 
I will remind my colleagues and the 
American 
people, 
when 
President 
Trump was asked about Roe v. Wade 
during his final debate against Hillary 
Clinton, he said: ‘‘If we put another 
two or three Justices on the court, the 
repeal of Roe v. Wade will happen auto-
matically.’’ Is that what this Repub-
lican majority stands for? If they do, 
announce it to the American people. 
Don’t hide behind this idea that Jus-
tices are calling balls and strikes; that 
they will obey precedent. Don’t hide 
behind that because we know what is 
happening here. 
The American people should make no 
mistake. Their fundamental rights are 
on the line: the right to affordable 
healthcare, to make their own medical 
decisions, to join a union, vote without 
impediment, the right to marry whom 
they love—that is what this is all 
about. 
Now Leader MCCONNELL has strained 
credulity to argue that ramming a Su-
preme Court Justice through the Sen-
ate while American voters wait in line 
to cast their ballots is completely nor-
mal. Nothing to see here, he says. Who 
believes him? I don’t think a single Re-
publican on that side believes him. 
They know what is going on. 
This is not the Senate, as he says, 
performing its historic function. It is a 
fiction. There is no precedent in his-
tory of the Senate for what the Repub-
licans are doing. 
Abraham Lincoln, our great hero, 
great Republican, rejected nominating 
somebody to the Supreme Court so 
close to an election. 
So Republicans, at the very least, 
ought to go on record and admit this is 
an extraordinary breach of precedent, 
of comity, of fairness, of decency, of 
honor, of truth, of consistency. 
So in a short time, I will make a 
point of order that the Senate should 
not consider a nomination to the Su-
preme Court this close to a Presi-
dential election. Every Senator will 
vote on whether a nomination this 
close to an election shall be in order. It 
will confirm to the American people 
what we all know to be true—that the 
Republican majority has absolutely no 
intention of honoring the supposed 
principle it so vehemently argued in 
2016. 
That they won’t follow history; that 
they won’t follow precedent; that they 
won’t follow norms and traditions of 
the Senate; that they won’t even follow 
their own standards—that is the indel-
ible mark on this Senate majority; 
that here in Leader MCCONNELL’s Sen-
ate, it is the rule of ‘‘because we can,’’ 
‘‘might makes right,’’ ‘‘because we 
can,’’ as Senator WHITEHOUSE put it, all 
to confirm a far-right Justice on the 
Court who would rip away healthcare 
from tens of millions of Americans in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
We will see how my Republican col-
leagues vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. 
THUNE. 
Mr. 
President, 
for 
months now, Democratic leaders have 
held additional COVID relief hostage. 
Instead of working with Republicans to 
arrive at a compromise bill that both 
parties can support and that can make 
it through both Houses of Congress, 
Democrats have insisted that it is their 
way or the highway. Either Repub-
licans agree to a bloated, multitrillion- 
dollar piece of legislation filled with 
noncoronavirus-related measures and 
far-left, liberal wish list items, a bill 
that would never make it through both 
Houses of Congress, or Americans get 
no relief. That is basically the choice 
the Democrats have left the American 
people. 
It goes without saying that this is 
not the attitude of a party that really 
wants to give help to Americans. This 
is the attitude of a party that wants to 
use this crisis for political purposes. 
Democrats figure that they win ei-
ther way. Either they use this crisis to 
force through a bunch of liberal prior-
ities not related to COVID or they 
blame Republicans for the lack of a 
bill. 
Completely absent from their cal-
culations is any sense of what their in-
transigence is costing the American 
people. 
If Democrats had actually been will-
ing to compromise with Republicans to 
reach consensus legislation, we could 
have had a new COVID relief bill 
months ago. Americans could be enjoy-
ing additional relief right now. 
Republicans have made it clear since 
the summer that we were willing to 
compromise with Democrats on a new 
bill. All we asked was that Democrats 
come to the table with a reasonable 
proposal that could actually make it 
through both Houses of Congress. 
But Democrats haven’t been inter-
ested. Oh, sure, Speaker PELOSI has 
supposedly been working on an agree-
ment with the White House for months. 
We constantly hear from the Speaker 
that a deal is getting closer, only to 
discover the next day that a deal isn’t 
really close at all. 
Let me tell you something. If you are 
the Speaker of the House and you real-
ly want to arrive at a compromise, it 
doesn’t take you 3 months. It probably 
even doesn’t take you 3 weeks. 
Democrats have to know very well 
that there is no way for them to get a 
bill containing everything they want 
through both Houses of Congress, but 
Democrats could get some of what they 
want, and isn’t something better than 
nothing? 
Even if Democrats were right about 
the need for every penny of spending 
that they are calling for, wouldn’t it be 
better to get some of that spending 
passed than to have nothing? To Demo-
crats, apparently the answer is no. 
In just a few minutes, the Senate will 
be voting on Republican coronavirus 
legislation. Our bill would provide 
more money for the hardest hit small 
businesses, more healthcare resources 
to fight the virus, and money to help 
schools reopen and operate safely—pri-
orities that all of us, Democrats and 
Republicans, should be able to agree 
on. In theory, I am pretty sure we do 
agree on them. And yet all signs sug-
gest that Democrats will filibuster this 
coronavirus relief legislation for the 
second time—even though passing this 
bill would get more money into the 
hands of small businesses and schools, 
even though this bill would provide ad-
ditional funding for COVID testing and 
treatment. 
Nevertheless, once again, Democrats 
will 
choose 
nothing—nothing—over 
something. Once again, Democrats will 
decide that if they can’t get everything 
they want, it is better for Americans 
not to have anything. 
I hope whatever perceived political 
gains Democrats are getting from their 
refusal to negotiate are worth denying 
help to the American people. 
In a few minutes, Republicans will 
cast their votes in favor of COVID re-
lief, and I invite rank-and-file Demo-
crats to reject their leader’s obstruc-
tion and join us on that vote. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6341 
October 21, 2020 
MCCONNELL, Republican leader of the 
U.S. Senate, opposes COVID–19 relief 
bill and informs the White House. 
Supposedly, it was a statement made 
by Senator MCCONNELL at his Repub-
lican lunch yesterday, and it was later 
confirmed by four Republican Senators 
who attended that that is what oc-
curred. 
Finally, it becomes public one of the 
things that has been suspected for a 
long time on this side of the aisle. You 
see, most of us have been paying close 
attention to the speeches by Senator 
MCCONNELL to try to gauge his interest 
in really coming back to help the 
American people. 
We remember on March 26, when 96 
to 0—96 to 0—the Senate voted for 
COVID relief in what was known as the 
CARES Act. It was a bipartisan meas-
ure responding to a national pandemic 
that was just starting to surface and an 
economy that was just starting to col-
lapse. 
Many people thought at the time 
that that would be the end of our jour-
ney, that we would do what is nec-
essary, and put it behind us. And so the 
unemployment assistance, for example, 
ended on July 31 of this year. The 
PPP—the Paycheck Protect Program— 
ended in the middle of August. We were 
wrong. 
The 
pandemic 
got 
dramatically 
worse, and the economy slumped even 
further. Millions more were out of 
work. Thousands were dying. More 
were infected. And we still are in a ter-
rible battle now against this deadly 
virus. 
So the obvious solution was for Con-
gress to come back and help again. The 
first measure was good and I think 
helpful, but it wasn’t enough. We need-
ed more. 
So NANCY
PELOSI, the Democratic 
Speaker of the House, 5 months ago—5 
months ago—in May passed a COVID 
relief bill to follow on from the origi-
nal bill. She sent it over to Senator 
MCCONNELL 5 months ago, and he did 
nothing. 
What he said was: I want to see if I 
feel a sense of urgency about the need 
for this bill—a sense of urgency. 
Well, today 220,000 Americans have 
died. Americans are dying at a pace 
from this coronavirus that is unimagi-
nable. Do you understand that the 
death rate from COVID in America is 
21⁄2 times the death rate in Canada? Do 
we realize the infection rate in the 
United States is five times what it is 
than Canada or Germany? Do we un-
derstand that with 4.5 percent of the 
world’s population, we lead in COVID 
deaths than anywhere in the world? 
The efforts to deal with COVID–19 
have failed, and the American people 
know it. They are tired of this way of 
living, with these masks, but they 
know if they don’t, they risk their 
health and the safety of others. They 
want this economy to come back to 
life. They want the kids to go back to 
school. But we can’t move forward un-
less we have leadership, No. 1, and that 
is what an election is all about; a plan, 
No. 2; and the resources to implement 
it. 
What are the resources that Senator 
MCCONNELL believes are necessary to 
deal with this? When it comes to test-
ing, $16 billion for the Nation—$16 bil-
lion. 
We are currently testing 1 million 
people a day across the United States. 
We should be testing 14 million people 
a day if we are serious about contact 
tracing, if we are serious about reopen-
ing the economy. 
So the Senator from Kentucky comes 
to the floor this morning and talks 
about the obstructionism of NANCY 
PELOSI. Obstructionism? Five months 
ago, she passed the COVID–19 relief bill 
and sent it to his desk, and he never 
once brought it to the floor for debate 
or a vote—not once. He mocks it and 
criticizes it day after day. He is afraid 
of voting before the U.S. Senate. So he 
comes up with an elaborate procedural 
scheme, which we will see in just a few 
minutes here, that basically wants to 
put together his package for COVID re-
lief, but his package is missing so 
many key elements that we know will 
not respond to this national crisis. It is 
the old story of a man 30 feet from 
shore drowning, and someone stands by 
the shore and tosses him a 5-foot rope. 
It doesn’t work. It doesn’t reach. It 
doesn’t save him. 
The Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve, Jerome Powell, has told us that 
if we don’t do something, there will be 
a tragic result in the American econ-
omy. If we pass a bill of the magnitude 
suggested by Speaker PELOSI, we have 
a chance of recovering by the end of 
2021. If we don’t, the Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve warns us—and others, 
as well—that we will slump into an 
even worse recession, even more unem-
ployment, and even more businesses 
failing. 
That appears to be what Senator 
MCCONNELL is prepared to accept, but 
we are not. Those of us set to deal with 
the real problems and challenges for 
Americans realize we need more than 
an effort of throwing a 5-foot rope to a 
man drowning 30 feet from shore. That 
is the McConnell approach. 
As we take a look at the elements 
that are missing in the McConnell ap-
proach, they are lengthy. Virtually 
every State and local government in 
the Nation has seen a downturn in rev-
enue because the economy contracted. 
We want to help these State and local 
governments survive to be able to over-
come the need to layoff healthcare 
workers, teachers, firefighters, and po-
lice. That is what we believe, and that 
is what we include in our bill, not in 
the McConnell bill. 
Housing. There is no funding for 
housing or rental assistance in the 
McConnell bill that he brought before 
us. 
Economic stimulus. Remember the 
$1,200 checks? There are no direct stim-
ulus checks in the McConnell proposal. 
He says that we are holding out to help 
the coastal elites. News flash, Senator 
MCCONNELL: Coastal elites don’t qual-
ify for these checks, nor should they. 
Ordinary people do, and your bill 
doesn’t help them. 
On unemployment, Senator MCCON-
NELL’s bill cuts the benefits in half— 
the Federal benefits for unemploy-
ment. Then he puts in this provision— 
an 
incredible 
provision—that 
gives 
large companies immunity from liabil-
ity if they do not take the necessary 
steps to protect their employees and 
customers. That is a high priority. The 
big shots do pretty well in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s bill. 
When it comes to testing, Senator 
MCCONNELL is prepared to spend $16 bil-
lion, as I mentioned earlier. The bill we 
support has over $57 billion for hos-
pitals and healthcare clinics and $75 
billion for testing. 
Nutrition. Senator MCCONNELL says 
we are just trying to help the blue- 
State billionaires. I have news for him: 
They don’t qualify for SNAP benefits. 
And there is no SNAP benefit increase 
in the McConnell bill. We believe there 
should be. People are standing in line 
at food banks. America can do better. 
Money to help the schools—we put 
more money into that than Senator 
MCCONNELL does. 
There is help for the Postal Service, 
which has been hard-pressed by the 
current state of the economy. 
We also have the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which we all agree needs 
to be there for small businesses. 
I will just conclude by saying this. 
We have our chance now to work to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to help 
people who are counting on us. Senator 
MCCONNELL’s approach has to be re-
jected. It is just an effort to find some 
cover politically so people can go home 
and say: Well, I voted for something. 
Let’s do something that makes a dif-
ference in the lives of people and helps 
them. Let’s deal with this coronavirus 
directly and let’s help those who are 
suffering from job loss and struggling 
to make ends meet get through this 
crisis themselves. That is the responsi-
bility we face, and it is one that I 
think we should face honestly. 
I listened as my friend and colleague, 
Senator THUNE, said that we were hold-
ing America hostage with our position 
on the Democratic side. We are not 
holding them hostage. It was Senator 
MCCONNELL who refused to participate 
in the negotiations and still does. We 
have a bipartisan effort between the 
White House and Speaker PELOSI to 
solve this problem and come together 
again as we did in March. It is time for 
us to do it. 
The President may say he is tired of 
COVID, but America can’t be tired of 
COVID. We have to face it every single 
day and fight it every day. The Senate 
and Congress should help. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur 
with everything that our distinguished 
assistant leader has said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6342 
October 21, 2020 
We are in the middle of the most dev-
astating health crisis in modern his-
tory, and the American people are pay-
ing a terrible price. Nearly 220,000 
Americans have died in just 10 months. 
To put that in perspective, that is sig-
nificantly more than the number of 
Americans who died in the Korean, 
Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars 
combined—all of them. 
Remember President Trump calling 
himself a ‘‘war President’’? President 
Trump said he was a ‘‘war President.’’ 
Well, has he acted like one? No. He 
called the virus a hoax. He has been 
AWOL ever since. 
Millions have lost their jobs. They 
are struggling to make ends meet. Peo-
ple are being evicted from their homes. 
They are living in their cars and in 
shelters or on the street. They are rely-
ing on the generosity of others, and the 
virus is still not remotely under con-
trol. The need for another comprehen-
sive emergency funding bill to address 
the COVID crisis is obvious. It is ur-
gent and has been for 5 months. And 
what is the Senate doing? Staging 
show votes on COVID relief bills that 
the majority leader knows will go no-
where. And then they go back on their 
word—both the majority leader and the 
chairman 
of 
the 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee—on what they said a year ago, 
and they try to rush through the nomi-
nation of a Supreme Court Justice less 
than 2 weeks before the election, after 
millions of Americans have already 
voted. 
So where are their priorities? 
I know where mine are. They are 
with the families of the 220,000 Ameri-
cans who have lost their lives to this 
virus. They are with the thousands of 
Vermonters and millions more across 
the Nation who lost their jobs during 
this pandemic. They are with the small 
business owners trying to stay afloat 
during this crisis. They are with the fa-
thers and mothers wondering if they 
will be able to pay next month’s rent 
or put food on the table, and they are 
with the children struggling to learn 
through Zoom calls and online classes. 
It is a national disaster, and it requires 
real solutions. 
We need a comprehensive bill to ad-
dress this problem. We can’t do it with 
fig leaves or do it piecemeal, like Sen-
ator MCCONNELL wants to do. We can’t 
pass an inadequate bill today on the 
chance that maybe we will come back 
later and do what we should have done 
to begin with. That is not how it 
works. Everyone knows that. 
We have one chance for the remain-
der of this year to get it right, and we 
owe it to the American people, every-
body—I don’t care if they are Repub-
licans, Democrats, Independents—ev-
erybody—to try. 
The majority leader staged a show 
yesterday. He didn’t bring up a com-
prehensive proposal for COVID relief 
and open it for debate. He called for a 
process vote and only one part of it, 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
Well, I support that program. We all 
do. It is critical in keeping literally 
thousands of small businesses afloat. 
But take a look at this proposal. It 
falls flat. It ignores critical improve-
ments to the programs that would be 
made by considering the Heroes Act— 
expanding access to all nonprofits, 
making critical-access hospitals eligi-
ble for PPP, and addressing arbitrary 
caps on various loan programs to help 
small businesses. 
More importantly, it is providing 
more funding for these programs, and 
nothing else would even remotely solve 
the problems facing our country. The 
economy will not come back until the 
American people have confidence that 
the virus has been vanquished. We need 
more funding for the PPP program. We 
all agree with that. We need to fix that 
program and do so much more. 
We have to invest more in testing. It 
needs to be based on a national testing 
and contact tracing strategy so we can 
quickly identify cases and isolate those 
who have been exposed. How many 
times do we have to say it? We need to 
develop a vaccine distribution program 
now so it can be up and running as soon 
as the vaccine is available. We have to 
provide personal protective equipment 
to those on the frontlines. We have to 
ensure our hospitals have the resources 
they need to take care of the ill. We 
need to keep our nursing homes safe 
and virus-free. 
Doing targeted bills aimed at one 
sector is the way to avoid doing what 
is really needed. It picks winners and 
losers at a time when everyone is 
struggling. No matter how much aid we 
give to small business or airlines or to 
our struggling restaurant industry, our 
economy won’t come back until the 
virus is under control. 
We need a comprehensive bill, not 
the so-called McConnell ‘‘skinny’’ bill 
we are voting on today, which provides 
only $500 billion of COVID relief, less 
than half of even what the Trump ad-
ministration proposed just a month 
ago. 
Look at the lines at food banks. They 
are skyrocketing during this crisis, but 
there is nothing in this bill for nutri-
tion assistance. Look at the millions of 
Americans who are struggling to pay 
next month’s rent or to keep up with 
their mortgage payments. Notwith-
standing the wishful thinking of the 
President, this is a massive problem, 
and either the President doesn’t know 
it or he doesn’t care. Maybe it is both. 
Today there are over 25 million 
Americans unemployed, compared to 
just 2 million at the end of January, 
and the unemployment assistance in 
this bill is totally inadequate. 
There is nothing in the bill for State 
and local governments that are on the 
frontline fighting this virus. There is 
inadequate money for testing, edu-
cation, and childcare; no funding for 
community health centers; no funding 
to fight this on a global level. We are 
not going to defeat this pandemic if we 
ignore what is happening outside of the 
United States. Americans can’t safely 
resume international travel and com-
merce. 
I can go on. There is so much that is 
missing. 
So what do they put in? They turn 
something over to the well-paid lobby-
ists 
of 
corporations 
by 
providing 
sweeping liability shields for corporate 
wrongdoers who have failed to do their 
part to keep employees, consumers, 
and patients safe. That tells you every-
thing you need to know about what is 
in it. A special earmark for big cor-
porations comes ahead of struggling 
American families. 
We know it is not going to pass. It 
shouldn’t pass. Let’s start working and 
getting something that can be passed 
instead of this. The House passed the 
Heroes bill over 5 months ago, and they 
passed it again 3 weeks ago. Why don’t 
we take it up and vote it up or vote it 
down? Let’s have some votes. Let’s 
make people stand up and see what 
they are really for. If we don’t, then, 
democracy has failed the American 
people. 
I remain hopeful that Speaker PELOSI 
and Secretary Mnuchin’s talks will re-
sult in a comprehensive deal on COVID 
relief that will solve real problems in 
America. Speaker PELOSI has already 
shown a willingness to compromise, 
and the other side must do the same. If 
it does, Senator MCCONNELL must com-
mit to bring it to the floor for a vote 
immediately, even if he personally op-
poses it, or the majority of his caucus 
opposes it. That is the way democ-
racies are supposed to work. The Amer-
ican people have waited long enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from North Caro-
lina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask

finish my comments before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
PROTECT AND SERVE ACT 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of the brave 
and hard-working men and women of 
law enforcement across this Nation. 
Last month, I talked about the dan-
gerous consequences of inaction by the 
Senate if we didn’t come to protect 
them. Unfortunately, since my last 
speech, four more law enforcement offi-
cers, men and women, have died—been 
murdered—in the line of duty. That is 
a 20-percent increase over the number 
last year. 
That doesn’t count the hundreds of 
police officers who have been injured in 
the line of duty, many of them still re-
covering 
from 
their 
wounds. 
The 
groundswell of violence against law en-
forcement is shocking, and it is our re-
sponsibility as Senators to act. 
Enough is enough. Rather than sup-
port radical ideas like defunding and 
abolishing 
the 
police, 
the 
Senate 
should take the lead and pass meaning-
ful legislation to protect law enforce-
ment officers, increasing funding, im-
proving training, and raising stand-
ards. That is why I again call on my

S6343 
October 21, 2020 
colleagues to support and pass the Pro-
tect and Serve Act, a bill that I spon-
sored and a bill that I hope we can get 
passed. 
The Protect and Serve Act would 
punish dangerous criminals who mur-
der a law enforcement officer in the 
line of duty. If they murder a law en-
forcement officer in the line of duty, 
they will be sentenced to life. If they 
injure a law enforcement officer in the 
line of duty, they will be sentenced to 
10 years in prison. The premise of the 
legislation is simple: There is no es-
cape from justice for dangerous crimi-
nals who intentionally assault or kill a 
law enforcement officer. 
The Senate passes legislation almost 
every day in this Chamber by unani-
mous consent, but I am sad to report 
that if I try to get unanimous consent 
for this bill, we would have objection 
on the floor. 
The heated rhetoric and the violent 
attacks on officers are having real- 
world impacts, and the safety of law 
enforcement has never been at the low 
that it is today. Across the country, 
recruitments are down. Fewer people 
are applying to go into service or into 
law enforcement academies, and retire-
ments are up. We are seeing our law en-
forcement ranks dwindle. It is sad, but 
it is not surprising. 
Law enforcement officers put their 
lives on the line every single day. 
Every morning, they wake up, they 
kiss their spouse goodbye, and they 
don’t know if they are going to come 
back safely. But when they spend all 
day being disrespected while doing this 
very difficult and very dangerous job 
and politicians harass them or allow 
them to be harassed, I should say, by 
violent mobs and protesters, there is 
no wonder morale is at an alltime low. 
Fewer police means more criminal 
activity. It means hard-working Amer-
ican citizens who go to work every day 
just to make their lives better are liv-
ing in communities that are less safe. 
We cannot sit idly by and allow the 
streets to be filled with dangerous, vio-
lent 
criminals 
who 
face 
no 
con-
sequences. Instead, we must speak up 
and show our men and women in blue 
that we respect them and we back 
them. 
They put their lives on the line to 
protect us, and we should do the work 
in Congress to protect them. In fact, in 
the last Congress, Speaker PELOSI al-
lowed this bill to be voted on. She sup-
ported making it a law. But now her 
conference is run by radical leftists 
who want to abolish the police or 
defund the police, and she is not even 
allowing this bill to be brought to the 
floor. She won’t speak in support of 
law enforcement officers despite the 
rising tide of violence against them. 
That is why the responsibility lies here 
in the Senate for us to show our sup-
port and let law enforcement commu-
nities across the country know that we 
have their back. 
Let’s protect police and deputies, and 
let’s pass the Protect and Serve Act. I 
urge the American people to call your 
Senators and tell them that you want 
this bill passed. You want law enforce-
ment to be safer, and you want our 
communities to be safer. Don’t be si-
lent. Help me fight for the men and 
women in blue. They are counting on 
all of us.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-
imous consent, the mandatory quorum 
call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the motion to 
concur in the House amendment to S. 
178, an act to condemn gross human 
rights violations of ethnic Turkic Mus-
lims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end 
to arbitrary detention, torture, and 
harassment of these communities in-
side and outside China, with a further 
amendment No. 2652, shall be brought 
to a close? 
The yeas and nays are mandatory 
under the rule. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Lead-
er MCCONNELL has argued that what 
the Republican majority is doing by 
ramming a Supreme Court Justice 
through the Senate mere days before a 
national Presidential election is com-
pletely normal, that it is perfectly con-
sistent with precedent. This is not 
true. There is no precedent in the his-
tory of the Senate for confirming a Su-
preme Court Justice this close to an 
election. There has never been—never 
been—a Supreme Court Justice con-
firmed after July of an election year. 
President Lincoln, a great Repub-
lican President—one of our foremost 
national heroes—rejected the oppor-
tunity to nominate someone for the 
Supreme Court close to an election. I 
dare say every single Republican Sen-
ator already knows this because they 
all argued that exact position 4 years 
ago. 
Republicans all argued that the Sen-
ate shouldn’t confirm Justices in Presi-
dential election years because of the 
supposed principle that ‘‘the American 
people deserve a voice.’’ Senate Repub-
licans made that argument 8 months

before the election. Now they are rush-
ing to confirm a Supreme Court Jus-
tice 8 days before the election, while 
Americans wait in line to cast their 
ballots. They are waiting in line. They 
are voting. Millions of Americans—tens 
of millions—have already voted. I have 
no doubt Republicans would confirm a 
Justice 8 minutes before election day if 
it meant they got their Justice. You 
could not design a set of circumstances 
more hypocritical than this. 
The truth is that the Republican ma-
jority is perpetrating the most rushed, 
most partisan, least legitimate process 
in the long history of Supreme Court 
nominations. Republicans, at the very 
least, ought to go on the record and 
admit that this is an extraordinary 
breach of fairness, of comity, of honor, 
of truth, of consistency, and, of course, 
precedent—a black and indelible mark 
on this Senate majority which will last 
forever. 
Mr. 
President, 
parliamentary 
in-
quiry: Has the Senate ever considered a 
nominee to the Supreme Court of the 
United States this close to a Presi-
dential election? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Accord-
ing to the Parliamentarian, the Sec-
retary of the Senate’s Office confirms 
that it has not. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
make a point of order that it should 
not be in order to consider a nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court of the 
United States this close to a Presi-
dential election. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
point of order is not ripe for decision

There appears to be a sufficient sec-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-

The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN TAX PLAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
about 2 weeks, the American people 
will go to the polls to determine the di-
rection of our Nation. There are many 
important issues voters will consider 
as they decide which way they will cast 
their votes. Their decisions will ulti-
mately determine who will be Presi-
dent and the makeup of Congress. 
One issue that is always front and 
center in any election is the economy 
and the economic policies of the re-
spective candidates. This election is no 
different. There are many differences 
in the economic policies that would be 
pursued by a Republican-led adminis-
tration versus the path my Democratic 
colleagues would take if they were to 
be in charge. One particular, stark dif-
ference is that of tax policy that both 
sides can be expected to pursue. 
Over the past 4 years, President 
Trump and the Republicans in Con-
gress have enacted historic tax cuts, 
particularly for middle-class Ameri-
cans. That has been part of a long, 
overdue revamp of our Tax Code. This 
has included reducing tax rates across 
the board, significantly increasing the 
standard deduction, and doubling the 
child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. As 
a result of these changes, a typical 
family of four earning $70,000 has seen 
its tax bill reduced by $2,000. 
While 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have done their best to distort this re-
ality about middle-income tax cuts, 
IRS tax return data of 2018 confirmed 
that middle-income Americans saw sig-
nificant tax reductions. In fact, tax-
payers in the middle of the income dis-
tribution saw their tax bills reduced by 
an average of more than 13 percent. My 
Democratic colleagues and former Vice 
President Biden have made no bones 
about their plans for tax reform. Their 
tax reform would be in tax increases. If 
they prevail in the upcoming elections, 
they will seek to reduce and undo the 
2017 tax law and impose trillions of dol-
lars in tax hikes on individuals and 
businesses. 
The 
former 
Vice 
President 
has 
sought to deflect accusations that he 
would raise taxes on low- and middle- 
income taxpayers by promising plans 
to increase taxes only on businesses 
and individuals who have annual in-
comes of over $400,000. There are many 
reasons to be skeptical of this promise 
of the Vice President’s, and I want to 
discuss this skepticism. 
First, a similar assurance was made 
by the Obama-Biden administration in 
its first term. Many will recall the 
Obama-Biden administration promised 
not to raise taxes on married couples 
earning less than $250,000 or $200,000 for 
single filers. That promise was tossed 
out the window when a host of new 
taxes that fell directly or indirectly on 
middle-income Americans was enacted 
to pay for ObamaCare. That included 
the individual mandate penalty tax, 80 
percent of which was paid by taxpayers 
earning less than $50,000 a year. This is 
exactly why the Republicans repealed 
that individual mandate as part of the 
2017 tax law—because it was very re-
gressive. 
A second reason low- and middle-in-
come Americans should take little 
comfort in the former Vice President’s 
promise to tax only the rich and busi-
nesses is that such taxes too often get 
passed along. There is a well-docu-
mented principle in any tax policy that 
simply because the law imposes a tax 
directly on an individual or business 
doesn’t mean the ultimate burden of 
that tax won’t fall on others indirectly. 
Every analysis of Mr. Biden’s tax 
plan by independent third parties, from 
the very liberal Tax Policy Center to 
Penn Wharton, to the American Enter-
prise Institute—so liberal, moderate, 
and 
conservative—shows 
taxpayers 
earning less than $400,000 will shoulder 
at least a portion of Mr. Biden’s pro-
posed tax increase. This comes from 
the fact that the tax increases largely 
reflect the economic consensus that a 
significant portion of the corporate in-
come tax falls on workers in the form 
of reduced wages and benefits. In other 
words, workers pay even if you in-
crease the corporate tax rate. Our non-
partisan Joint Committee on Taxation 
has estimated that 25 percent of the 
corporate tax increases are, in fact, 
borne by workers. Mr. Biden, of course, 
has promised to increase the corporate 
income tax from 21 percent to 28 per-
cent. 
According 
to 
the 
Penn 
Wharton 
Budget Model, this business tax hike 
will mean that over 90 percent of 
households 
with 
incomes 
between

October 21, 2020 
$45,600 and $121,000 will see increases in 
their total tax burdens. With the bulk 
of Mr. Biden’s tax agenda being tar-
geted at hiking taxes on capital, the 
consequences will then be felt through-
out the economy in the form of lower 
wages, fewer jobs, and slower economic 
growth. 
According to a study out of the Hoo-
ver Institution this week, the Biden 
plan holds the promise of reducing the 
per capita gross domestic product by 
more than 8 percent when compared to 
the current law with the 2017 Trump 
tax law being made permanent. This 
raises an additional important issue. 
Taxpayers should take with a whole 
grain of salt Mr. Biden’s promise of not 
raising their taxes because the vast 
majority of Americans will see a tax 
increase beginning in 2026 unless the 
2017 tax cuts are made permanent. 
A top priority for President Trump 
and 
congressional 
Republicans 
has 
been to make permanent the middle- 
class tax cuts that were enacted in 2017 
but which will otherwise sunset in 2025. 
President Trump has called for making 
the tax cuts permanent as part of each 
of his budget submissions to Congress. 
Now we have the Democrats refusing to 
work with the Republicans to make the 
middle-income tax cuts of 2017 perma-
nent law so that taxes won’t go up 
automatically in 2026. 
Keep in mind that the middle-class 
tax cuts enacted in tax reform are not 
just about lower tax rates for middle- 
income workers and families; they are 
also about small business owners and 
family farmers. For the millions of 
small 
family-owned 
businesses 
and 
family farmers, the tax reform of 2017 
has provided a 20-percent deduction for 
qualified business income under sec-
tion No. 199A. The whole purpose was 
for it to be for individual filers in order 
to reduce the inequity between a lower 
corporate tax rate and what individ-
uals would pay if they were in business 
so as to compensate for the capital 
that they would have to have invested 
for their small businesses. 
According to the recently released 
2018 IRS data, in Iowa alone, in my 
State alone, nearly 215,000 small busi-
nesses and farms across our State bene-
fited from this 20 percent deduction in 
section No. 199A. The Republicans are 
committed to making this provision 
permanent, for it is a very important 
tool for those small businesses and 
farms to be able to grow, invest, and 
provide critically needed jobs in our 
communities. 
However, 
Mr. 
Biden’s 
tax 
plan 
doesn’t include any proposal to make 
permanent or to even extend the mid-
dle-class tax cuts that have been en-
acted under President Trump. Indeed, 
every independent third-party review 
of his tax proposal assumes his intent 
is to allow the tax increases to go into 
effect. 
And with good reason—because on 
the campaign trail, Mr. Biden has stat-
ed: ‘‘On day one, I will move to elimi-
nate the Trump tax cuts.’’ It can’t be 
both that he will only raise taxes on 
those with incomes over $400,000 and 
repeal the Trump tax cuts in their en-
tirety. 
So who can blame taxpayers for 
being skeptical when Mr. Biden says 
that he won’t raise their taxes? Every 
indication is that he will raise taxes on 
people below a $400,000-a-year income. 
Under a Biden administration, mid-
dle-income individuals can expect a 
Biden plan that rolls back the Trump 
tax cuts. This means he will increase 
their tax rates, increase the amount of 
their income subject to tax, and reduce 
tax benefits for families. 
Similarly, small business owners and 
family farmers can also expect him to 
tax a larger share of their business in-
come. 
While Mr. Biden has tried to position 
himself as a centrist on this tax issue, 
his tax and economic agenda is not all 
that different from his far-left oppo-
nents in the Democratic primaries. 
His sales pitch may be different, but 
his agenda will have the same detri-
mental effect. As the Wall Street Jour-
nal’s editorial board summed it up, the 
problem with the Biden policies is 
‘‘they will have a long-term corrosive 
impact by raising the cost of capital, 
[by] reducing the incentive to work and 
invest, and [lastly] reducing produc-
tivity across the economy. Americans 
will pay the price in a lower standard 
of living than they otherwise would 
[have]—and that they deserve.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, thank 
you. I rise to talk about Americans’ 
health and the health of Virginians. 
We are living through a crisis—the 
coronavirus crisis—that is unprece-
dented in American life since 100 years 
ago with the influenza of the late 19- 
teens, and a lot of words have been 
used on the floor to describe the mag-
nitude of the crisis. I needn’t dwell on 
that. Now nearly 220,000 Americans 
have died. A recent study that was put 
out suggested that the actual toll may 
be closer to 300,000. 
Many States in the country are expe-
riencing dramatic spikes, with pre-
dictions that we could see the worst 
levels 
of 
coronavirus 
in 
coming 
months, at least until a vaccine is de-
veloped and widely distributed, and 
that probably won’t happen before the 
spring of next year. 
In Virginia, we have been hit—3,515 
Virginians have died of coronavirus. 
My wife and I know three of them—two 
in Richmond and one in Fairfax Coun-
ty. And 168,722 Virginians have had 
coronavirus. My wife and I are two in 
that number. 
This challenge in Virginia hit first in 
a tiny part of the State that I really 
love, the Eastern Shore of Virginia. 
That is one of the least accessible parts 
of Virginia. The Eastern Shore has two 
sizable poultry processing plants, with 
thousands of workers—a mixture of 
White 
workers, 
African-American 
workers, Latino immigrants, Haitian- 
Creole immigrants. 
In March, at these two plants—one 
run by Tyson and the second run by 
Purdue Food Company—they started to 
see cases multiply. Many were asymp-
tomatic. People didn’t know they had 
it, but that meant they could spread 
the virus to others. The healthcare net-
work in the Eastern Shore of Virginia 
was dramatically taxed by this fast- 
moving and little-understood crisis at 
the time. 
That was our first hot spot in Vir-
ginia. Other States had their hot spots; 
that was ours. 
Thank goodness, as Virginians have 
grappled with this crisis and as we 
have grappled with it across the coun-
try, there have been some protections, 
and I want to stand and talk about the 
protections that have been provided to 
Virginians during this time by the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
About 400,000 Virginians have Med-
icaid because of the Affordable Care 
Act. Virginia embraced the expansion 
of Medicaid 2 years ago, so people have 
been able to get insurance, many for 
the first time in their lives, and that 
400-plus thousand have been able to ac-
cess care. 
Virginians have been protected if 
they had preexisting conditions, and 
now having had coronavirus is a pre-
existing condition, and the many peo-
ple 
who 
suffer 
from 
long-haul 
coronavirus 
symptoms 
have 
pre-
existing conditions. They have been 
protected. 
Young people have been able to stay 
on family policies, which has been par-
ticularly helpful in a time of economic 
challenge, where a lot of young people 
have lost jobs or not been able to find 
them. And other people who have lost 
jobs in the private sector have been 
able to go on the exchanges and buy in-
surance, and if their income isn’t high, 
have a subsidy that would make the 
premiums more affordable. 
So as bad as this has been, it would 
have been a lot worse were it not for an 
Affordable Care Act providing protec-
tions for families and individuals. 
I don’t pretend to understand every-
thing. I have been around for a while, 
but there are a lot of things I still 
don’t understand, and I will just be 
candid. One thing I don’t understand is 
why the repeal of the Affordable Care 
Act is like the Moby Dick that the 
GOP and the Trump administration 
has been searching to kill this worthy 
healthcare bill that is protecting peo-
ple at a critical time. 
During the time I have been in the 
Senate, since 2013, I have seen, during 
the Trump administration, numerous 
efforts to, via administrative sabotage, 
weaken the law. 
I have been here as we have cast vote 
after vote after vote to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
I saw a shutdown driven by a Senate 
colleague from Texas a few years ago 
all around repealing the Affordable

Care Act. It was important enough to 
shut the entire government of the 
United States down for more than 2 
weeks. 
I stood here on the floor at the most 
dramatic moment ever in my political 
life. You might think it might have 
been, like, election night 2016. No, the 
most dramatic moment ever in my po-
litical life was the night we stood here 
on the floor at about 2 in the morning 
and John McCain, having been diag-
nosed with a glioblastoma, came out of 
the hospital and cast the deciding vote 
to make sure that millions of Ameri-
cans wouldn’t lose their health insur-
ance. 
And in addition to administrative 
sabotage and repeated votes in the 
Chamber, we have seen one court case 
after the next, sponsored by Repub-
licans, to try to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act. 
And now we see sort of Moby Dick 
coming into sight with the California 
v. Texas case to be argued at the Su-
preme Court on November 10. 
My constituents in Virginia who rely 
on the Affordable Care Act and are 
afraid to death for themselves and 
their family members are petrified. 
Let me read you some stories from 
four constituents of the many that I 
have received. 
Michelle from New Castle. New Cas-
tle is in Appalachian Southwest Vir-
ginia. She wrote in about her 9-year- 
old son Evan. Michelle moved to Vir-
ginia from Texas because Texas didn’t 
have expanded Medicaid and Virginia 
did. 
I am new to Virginia. I recently moved 
from Texas, and [I] am incredibly concerned 
with the Supreme Court nominee and the 
protections given in the Affordable Care Act. 
My son Evan, who is 9 years old, was born 
with a rare abdominal wall defect called an 
omphalocele. After many surgeries, and 
staying in the hospital for the first 8 months 
fighting for his life, he came home. At the 
time, he was covered by his father’s em-
ployer-sponsored health insurance. He was 
protected under the ACA. His health care, 
which included ventilator support, tube feed-
ing, and a number of surgeries, easily came 
to millions of dollars. 
As he has grown, he has received other di-
agnoses—autism, 
ADHD, 
nystagmus 
and 
other visual impairments. I know very well 
from my experience with health coverage in 
Texas, the constant battle a person faces 
while trying to get treatment for autism-re-
lated therapy, and to even be covered by 
Medicaid. I was denied coverage for my son, 
because I ‘‘made too much.’’ My income as a 
single mother was $35,000. I was working 
sometimes 60 hours a week, paying $650 
every month for childcare. The cost of my 
employer sponsored health insurance for my-
self and my son and daughter was $800 a 
month. I could not afford that, and [I] had to 
choose between having coverage for my chil-
dren and being able to pay our water and 
light bills. It took months to receive a deci-
sion that we were denied for Medicaid. 
Upon my move to Virginia, I was able to 
obtain Medicaid not just for my son, who had 
been denied in Texas, but for every house-
hold member. It took two weeks. 
The ACA is protecting my son and his abil-
ity to be covered by other insurance is so 
necessary. . . . I’m contacting my Senators 
on subjects that affect my family frequently. 
. . . My family means everything to me. My 
son’s life isn’t something I take for granted. 
I fought for him, every day, while he strug-
gled through pulmonary hypertension, and it 
was four long months before I [even] heard 
the words ‘‘WHEN he goes home’’ rather 
than ‘‘IF he goes home.’’ 
Dawn from Virginia writes about her 
20-year-old daughter—she is from Vi-
enna in Northern Virginia—who works 
a part-time job with no benefits. 
My daughter is 20 with multiple health 
conditions and has a part time job with no 
benefits, but she is able to be on my insur-
ance. I am concerned about the upcoming 
Supreme Court vote on the ACA. 
What will happen to young people like my 
daughter if the ACA is gone? 
A veteran, Lieutenant Alvia from 
Hampton in Hampton Roads. 
I am a 100% permanently disabled veteran. 
Although most of my medical care is pro-
vided by the VA, my care is supplemented by 
Medicare and the services of a Medicaid 
Alert Service Dog. The latter two care serv-
ices are threatened by the abolishment of 
the Affordable Care Act and challenges to 
the American Disability Act. . . . With the 
Supreme Court scheduled to hear arguments 
to repeal the [ACA] soon, this puts lives and 
rights at unacceptable risk. 
Donna from Henrico in the Richmond 
area where I live writes about her hus-
band, 
diagnosed 
with 
glioblastoma 
brain cancer: 
My husband was diagnosed with glio-
blastoma . . . back in June of 2020. The in-
surance claims have now exceeded one MIL-
LION dollars and will continue to rise with 
doctors and treatments. Thankfully, we have 
health insurance through the Marketplace. 
My husband isn’t able to work and my job 
has no benefits. 
I fear what it would be like for us if 
ObamaCare is overturned by the Repub-
licans. No private insurance will ever accept 
us, so we must continue to rely on getting 
our insurance through the Marketplace. 
And now we are rushing a Supreme 
Court nominee. In 2016, I was in this 
Chamber and saw many of my Repub-
lican colleagues make the argument 
that they would not entertain a nomi-
nation by President Obama, not that 
they would vote against the nominee— 
that would be consistent with advise 
and consent—but that they would not 
let the individual in their office, not 
have a Judiciary Committee hearing, 
not have a Judiciary Committee vote, 
not have a floor debate, not have a 
floor vote. 
And the principle that was newly an-
nounced in 2016 was ‘‘let the people de-
cide.’’ Let the voters vote for President 
and the Senate, and then we will see 
about filling a Supreme Court vacancy. 
And my colleagues looked me in the 
face and the voters in the face, too, and 
they said: This precedent is a precedent 
we will apply equally to a Republican 
President as a Democratic President. 
But now that promise is being bro-
ken. Those words to colleagues and 
those words to the public are being re-
versed. 
There are some outside this body who 
think that is just what politicians do. 
They say things and then do the oppo-
site. They are not surprised by that. I 
don’t think that is true. My experience 
here since 2013 is when my colleagues 
tell me something, they do it. 
I have got great relations with col-
leagues on the Republican side of the 
aisle. When they tell me something, 
they do it. And if they can’t do it, they 
will tell me that. 
This is very, very different. Changing 
the tune—we will not fill a vacancy in 
a Presidential year. We will let the 
people decide—what is the reason for 
the change? 
And I have concluded that since peo-
ple normally don’t go back on what 
they said—and this is a rare instance 
in my time here in the Senate—the 
reason is a real important one, and the 
reason is finally we see Moby Dick in 
our sight, and we have a chance to gut 
the Affordable Care Act. We have one 
last chance it do it in a case that is 
going to be argued in the Supreme 
Court on November 10. 
And that is so important to us in a 
pandemic, with people dying and sick 
and suffering, that we are willing to 
break our word to rush a Justice to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act. For God’s 
sake, why? 
For God’s sake, why? 
I am struck by the fact I have un-
fairly used a broad brush to cast asper-
sions at the GOP in the Senate. I am 
struck by the fact that two GOP Sen-
ators said: You are right. This is 
wrong. We shouldn’t rush the Justice. 
We should let the people decide. 
Who were the two Republicans who 
said that? Senators COLLINS of Maine 
and MURKOWSKI
of Alaska, who, to-
gether with John McCain in August of 
2017, stood on the floor in the middle of 
the night and cast deciding votes to 
make sure that people would have 
healthcare instead of millions losing 
their healthcare. They are sticking by 
their word because they know what is 
at stake and they know what this rush 
means. 
We shouldn’t be rushing a Supreme 
Court nominee and people breaking 
their word to do so. On the Court, we 
should hold folks to their promises. Let 
the people decide. They are voting; 37 
million people have voted already in 
the United States. Let’s let the people 
decide who the next President is and 
who the next Senate is, and, obviously, 
if it is a Republican President and Re-
publican Senate, everyone will under-
stand moving quickly to voting on the 
nomination of Judge Barrett, but let’s 
at least let the people decide. That is 
what we should be doing on the Court. 
And here’s what we should be doing in-
stead of forcing an unprecedented rush 
to a Justice who can be part of destroy-
ing the Affordable Care Act: Let’s work 
on 
COVID. 
Let’s 
work 
on 
the 
healthcare crisis. 
But I am disappointed. After good 
work together on four bills in March 
and April to inject trillions of dollars 
to help people, businesses, and hos-
pitals, we knew we needed to do more. 
The House put a bill on the table at the 
end of May, and then there were 
months of delay here in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6347 
October 21, 2020 
I knew that the Senate Republican 
majority would not embrace the House 
proposal, but I thought they would do 
something. But after the House acted 
in May, June went by—nothing. July 
went by—nothing. August went by— 
nothing. Most of September went by— 
nothing. 
Eventually, a Republican proposal 
was put on the table that couldn’t even 
generate strong support within the Re-
publican caucus. It was dramatically 
insufficient, from my view, because it 
provided no assistance for housing, 
rent, mortgage, food, SNAP benefits, 
State and local government. It pro-
vided none of those things. 
So Democrats and some Republicans 
voted against it with the hopes that 
that vote would do exactly what it did 
when we cast a similar vote in March: 
We vote down a partisan proposal. It 
opens the door for negotiations. The 
White House gets engaged. We do some-
thing that is good for the entire Amer-
ican public. Our vote did have that ef-
fect—sort of. 
The ‘‘no’’ vote on the Republican pro-
posal in September did start a more ro-
bust discussion with the White House 
about what should be done to provide 
COVID relief—but not here in the Sen-
ate. Repeatedly, as Democratic leader-
ship has been talking to Secretary 
Mnuchin over at the White House, we 
read in the paper that Senator MCCON-
NELL, the leader, has been telling mem-
bers of the GOP: We are not doing a 
deal. Don’t do a deal—cold water on 
the deal. 
Now we are having some sort of show 
votes on insufficient proposals this 
week, but to come to the floor to cast 
a vote on a motion to table a proposal 
when everybody knows it is not going 
anywhere because it is not sufficient at 
the same time as we are reading head-
lines in the paper that the majority 
leader is telling the GOP: Do not do a 
deal. Do not do a COVID deal. 
The PPP package that we voted on 
yesterday was insufficient. We refilled 
the bucket for small businesses in 
April, as we should have, and we have 
to refill it again. But the package yes-
terday didn’t do anything for res-
taurants, didn’t do anything for many 
in the small business sector, and it in-
cluded nothing for individuals who are 
hit hard by unemployment or families 
who need relief or people who need 
testing. 
The bill that we just voted on today, 
the ‘‘skinny’’ COVID bill, was insuffi-
cient for the same reasons that led it 
to be voted down by Democrats and Re-
publicans in September. 
As I conclude, I want to go back to 
the Eastern Shore. I have another col-
league on the floor who wants to talk, 
but I started off talking about the 
Eastern Shore, where Virginia’s COVID 
experience began with a hot spot in 
two poultry processing plants. 
I have a good-news story for the Pre-
siding Officer because I was on the 
Eastern Shore a couple of days ago, but 
I have a challenging punch line to my 
good-news story. 
This is where it started in Virginia— 
hot spots in these poultry plants. 
These low-income workers—many im-
migrants—saw President Trump de-
clare that this was an essential indus-
try, so they stood up and said: If the in-
dustry is essential, we are not sawdust. 
We are not inessential. We are not ex-
pendable. We are not throwaway. If the 
industry is essential and has to sail, 
then we are essential too. 
They stood up and asked the Gov-
ernor to adopt a basic safety rule about 
how to return safely to work in these 
plants during a time of COVID. The 
Governor heard their request and said: 
Well, maybe, but let me see if OSHA 
will do something. Won’t the Federal 
labor agencies come and put a safety 
rule in place? And OSHA did nothing. 
So, in July, at the request of these 
poultry workers who are now in an es-
sential industry but are risking their 
health, the Governor of Virginia en-
acted a temporary safety rule, not just 
for poultry plants but for places of 
work to make sure that, as people are 
coming back to work, they can be safe. 
Good news, Mr. President: After that 
law was enacted, the cases on the East-
ern Shore declined and declined and de-
clined, and of the 134 cities and coun-
ties in Virginia, right now, even with 
two of these big poultry plants, the 
caseload on the Eastern Shore per cap-
ita is just about the best in Virginia. 
But the bill we just voted down, this 
‘‘skinny’’ bill we just voted down that 
had a liability protection component to 
it—it wasn’t just liability protection. I 
would be for liability protection. If you 
want to protect someone from liabil-
ity—normally we don’t at the Federal 
level, but you can. What you do is set 
a standard of care, and then you say 
that everybody who exceeds the stand-
ard of care is protected from liability. 
The ‘‘skinny’’ proposal that we just 
voted on had liability protection, but it 
didn’t set a standard of care. It just ex-
cused people from liability, and it did 
something even worse. It did some-
thing even worse, and that was one of 
the reasons I voted against it. 
The bill that we just voted down 
would have wiped out the Virginia safe-
ty rule. It would have wiped out the 
ability of any State to pass a tem-
porary safety rule to protect workers 
so that they could come back to work 
safely in a time of COVID. 
It is one thing to try to kill the Af-
fordable Care Act in the middle of a 
pandemic and take health insurance 
away from millions. It is another thing 
to rush a Supreme Court Justice in vio-
lation of what you said you would do to 
try to achieve your goal of killing the 
Affordable Care Act. But trying to wipe 
out State safety laws that are working 
in my Commonwealth to effectively 
protect workers whom the President 
has declared essential—I have seen ev-
erything. I have seen everything. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett is a wise, experi-
enced, 
compassionate, 
and 
strong 
woman. This past week, Iowans and all 
Americans had the chance to see that. 
No matter the question or the topic, 
she was calm, cool, and collected. She 
invoked the rule set by the late Justice 
Ginsburg in providing no hints, pre-
views, or forecasts as to how she would 
decide any given case. That is how 
judges should act, because, as Judge 
Barrett points out, judges aren’t legal 
pundits; their role is to rule on the law. 
Certainly, that seemed to frustrate 
some folks. It is like they wanted that 
big TV moment to score just one more 
point on the political scoreboard this 
election cycle. They weren’t focused on 
understanding Judge Barrett’s judicial 
philosophy and temperament. 
What has become crystal clear to me 
throughout this process is that Judge 
Barrett’s academic and professional 
qualifications are above reproach. As a 
law professor at Notre Dame, her alma 
mater, she offered numerous academic 
articles on the topic of constitutional 
law. 
As a Seventh Circuit Court judge, she 
has authored 79 majority opinions. Of 
those majority opinions, they have 
been unanimous 95 percent of the time. 
Judge Barrett has shown a commit-
ment to the law and Constitution and 
has an even hand in applying the sa-
cred tenets of our democracy. Like 
most Iowans, I firmly believe in the 
role of our Supreme Court. It is the de-
fender of our Constitution. 
At the end of the day, that is my test 
for a Supreme Court Justice: Will she 
defend the Constitution? 
Why is this so important? Because 
far too often, politicians in Washington 
want the Supreme Court to be a super-
legislature to push policy that can’t 
make it through Congress. But that is 
not the job of the Supreme Court. We 
must resist with all effort the push to 
make this happen now and in the fu-
ture. 
Last 
week, 
Judge 
Barrett 
dem-
onstrated that she would be a defender 
of the Constitution—a soon-to-be Jus-
tice who will rule based on the Con-
stitution, who will leave the policy de-
cisions to Congress and decide the 
cases at hand, not the political winds 
of the moment. 
This week, the Senate will consider 
adding another woman to the highest 
Court in the land. This is something all 
women of every political party or per-
suasion should be applauding. But it 
seems like the left can’t bring them-
selves to see this nomination as a great 
story for women. 
I am struck by the irony of how de-
meaning to women some of the left’s 
accusations 
really 
are—that 
Judge 
Barrett, a working mother of seven 
with a strong record of professional 
and 
academic 
accomplishment, 
couldn’t possibly respect the goals and 
desires of today’s women. 
The great freedom of being an Amer-
ican woman is that we can decide how

October 21, 2020 
to live our lives, whom to marry, what 
kind of person we are, and where we 
want to go. I served in the military— 
something not exactly popular at var-
ious points in America’s history. We 
don’t have to fit into the narrow defini-
tion of womanhood. We create our own 
path. 
So, folks, I implore you to recognize 
this nominee for who she is. Judge Bar-
rett has shown that she has the utmost 
qualifications and the character to 
serve on our Nation’s highest Court. 
She is a role model for young women in 
Iowa and all around this Nation—a 
wife, a mom of seven, a woman of faith, 
a midwesterner. 
She did not receive her law degree 
from an Ivy League school. Some folks 
may not like that, but I appreciate 
someone, like myself, who has lived 
and learned beyond America’s upper 
crust and coastlines and has seen 
America through the eyes of a farmer 
and the soul of a railman—an accom-
plished jurist and truly a wonderful 
and decent person. 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett 
has 
dem-
onstrated to the world that this—be-
coming a Supreme Court Justice—is 
what a mom can do. 
I look forward to supporting her 
nomination, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, let me 
just follow right on with that impor-
tant topic of the vote we will have in a 
few days to send another Justice to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
I had the opportunity this morning 
to meet with Judge Barrett. The con-
versation reminded me exactly why she 
is the right choice to fill the vacancy 
on the Supreme Court now. I was asked 
the first weekend of this discussion, be-
fore the President had made the deci-
sion, if I could vote for her, and I 
quickly said yes, having watched her 
circuit judge bipartisan confirmation, 
having seen how that discussion went. 
I have had her on a short list that I 
have kept myself for a long time as 
someone who would be an important 
addition to the Court. 
She was first in her class at Notre 
Dame; clerked on the district court in 
Washington, DC; clerked for Justice 
Scalia at the Supreme Court; and was a 
law professor at Notre Dame for 15 
years. At least three times in that 15 
years, she was chosen by students as 
the top faculty member. She was 
bipartisanly confirmed on the Seventh 
Circuit and has a history over the last 
3 years of the kind of Justice she would 
be. 
The dean at the law school at Notre 
Dame had this to say about Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett. He said: 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an absolutely 
brilliant legal scholar and jurist. . . . She 
lives a life of humility and grace, devoted to 
her family and community. 
Somebody else at the Notre Dame 
Law School said that when Professor 
Barrett was in the room, the smartest 
person in the room was also the most 
humble person in the room. I think we 
saw some of that when she was before 
the Judiciary Committee as she an-
swered those questions understanding 
what her job was, understanding the 
job of a judge is not to decide what the 
law should say but what the law does 
say; not to decide what the Constitu-
tion should say but what it does say 
and even more importantly, in her view 
of what a judge should look at, what 
people thought it said when they wrote 
it, that textualist, that originalist con-
cept. She I think rightly perceived that 
if we want to change the Constitution, 
there is a way to do that. If we want to 
update it to what it might mean now, 
we have the chance to do that. Cer-
tainly, if we want to change the law, 
we have the chance to do that. 
If you really listened to the ques-
tions, particularly from our friends on 
the other side, the Democrats on that 
committee, they were all very much 
premised on: Well, what do you be-
lieve? What do you think about this? 
What do you think about that? 
That is not the point. She, I thought, 
very consistently, for 24 hours, made 
the point that the point is, it is not 
about what I believe; it is about what 
the law says. 
By the way, members of the com-
mittee—she didn’t say this, but it was 
obvious—it is your job to decide what 
the law says. It is the job of the Court 
to decide how the law is applied and 
whether it meets the test of the Con-
stitution. 
A widely respected scholar, a person 
of faith—by the way, I think in the pre-
vious hearing, we all heard that com-
ment ‘‘The dogma lives loudly in you.’’ 
There may be a good way to use the 
word ‘‘dogma,’’ but I don’t think I have 
ever heard it used in a positive way. 
But if you just substituted ‘‘dogma’’ 
for ‘‘faith,’’ what a great thing that 
would be to say about somebody. The 
faith lives—your faith—the faith lives 
loudly in you. No matter what your 
faith is, that is a great thing to hear 
about yourself or to be able to say 
about somebody else. Lots of people 
say that about Amy Coney Barrett. 
She has written 79 opinions at the 
circuit court level, the court level 
right below the Supreme Court. Every-
thing she said as a circuit judge, as a 
witness before the committee, and as a 
nominee before the committee has 
been exactly what I think a judge 
should do. 
The day she was nominated by the 
President, she said: 
A judge must apply the law as written. 
Judges are not policymakers, and they must 
be resolute in setting aside any policy views 
they might hold. 
Judge Scalia famously said that a 
really good judge will often issue an 
opinion that they wish was a different 
opinion; an opinion that doesn’t meet 
their view of what they would like to 
see happen but meets their view of 
what the law requires to happen. 
The 
American 
Bar 
Association— 
sometimes not that friendly to Repub-
lican nominees to the court—concluded 
that she was well qualified. They asked 
for input from more than 900 people fa-
miliar with Judge Barrett, and in the 
end, not one person uttered a negative 
word about her. Certainly, there is no-
body who has been elected to this body 
who didn’t have lots of negative words 
said about them. But just to find 900 
people and none of them have a nega-
tive thing to say I think is a great indi-
cation of who she is. 
One lawyer told the ABA that she is 
‘‘an intellectual giant with people 
skills, and engaging warmth.’’ Not 
every intellectual giant is praised for 
their warmth or their people skills. 
It is clear that she is well qualified. 
It is clear that she is a brilliant law-
yer. It is clear that she cares about her 
faith, about her family, and about her 
community. 
As Senator ERNST mentioned, she is 
the first nominee since Sandra Day 
O’Connor who didn’t graduate from 
Yale or Harvard. There is nothing 
wrong with Yale or Harvard, but there 
is nothing wrong with having a dif-
ferent background as you come to the 
Court, particularly if all of your asso-
ciations as a lawyer have been that 
‘‘she’s mind-blowingly intelligent’’— 
that was one of her colleagues at Notre 
Dame—‘‘and she’s also one of the most 
humble people you’re going to meet.’’ 
Brilliant and humble is a pretty good 
combination. America needs judges 
that bring both humility and brilliance 
to the court. The Supreme Court will 
benefit from her being there. 
I certainly look forward to voting for 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett as she moves 
from that job to Associate Justice Amy 
Coney Barrett, and I believe we will be 
able to do that within the next few 
days. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
tell you, it is quite an honor to join my 
colleagues and talk for a few minutes 
about our Supreme Court nominee, 
Judge Barrett. 
In the Judiciary Committee, where I 
hold a seat, we were doing one of our 
most important duties—our constitu-
tional duty to provide advice and con-
sent regarding the President’s nominee 
for the Supreme Court. Indeed, we do 
this with all of our Federal judges who 
come before us. 
Last week, we fulfilled that highest 
level of duty as we examined Judge 
Barrett’s record, her character, and to 
see if she is qualified to sit on the Su-
preme Court. As you were hearing from 
my colleagues today, yes, indeed, she is 
qualified. 
Now, I will tell you that unfortu-
nately some of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle spent their time 
fishing for sound bites and feigning 
confusion over the fact that Judge Bar-
rett takes her cues from the Constitu-
tion and not from the latest polling 
and not from the 24-hour news cycle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6349 
October 21, 2020 
Honestly, I think that said more about 
them than it did about her. 
That is what happens when leaders 
who really ought to know better allow 
politics to take control of their vetting 
process and their thought process. 
That is what most Americans took 
away from those hearings last week, 
that in the eyes of those on the Demo-
cratic side of the dais, there was no 
way Judge Amy Coney Barrett was 
ever going to make them happy be-
cause, to them, only answers that 
tracked with their views—views on the 
left—on abortion, on religion, and on 
socialized medicine would pass muster. 
This is an absurd standard, I will tell 
you, and it is no standard at all be-
cause those views shift and change de-
pending on what the loudest mega-
phone on the National Mall has to say 
on any given day. 
So, in the interest of refocusing on 
our duty to offer advice and consent, I 
think we could all stand a quick recap 
of last week’s hearing. 
Here is what we know: Judge Barrett 
is exceptionally smart, she is focused, 
and she is a mindful jurist. Her col-
leagues, students, former clerks, and 
professional associates from all back-
grounds and all world views whole-
heartedly believe she is competent and 
prepared to hold a seat on the Supreme 
Court. Her record is consistent with 
the originalist lens she puts over the 
cases and controversies that come 
across her desk. Over the course of 2 
days of intense questioning, she did not 
contradict that record or violate the 
rules of judicial ethics by offering a 
preview of future rulings. 
The American Bar Association rated 
her as ‘‘well qualified’’ to serve on the 
Court. Based on the testimony and evi-
dence offered to the committee, I will 
tell you, I definitely agree with them. 
I will vote to confirm Judge Barrett 
to the Supreme Court, and I would en-
courage all my colleagues who plan on 
voting no to think long and hard about 
why that is. If they have not taken the 
time to get to know Judge Barrett— 
her background and her record—I en-
courage them to get to know a little 
bit about her and also to ask them-
selves how smart was it to have spent 
the past month signaling their willing-
ness to dismantle our constitutional 
framework to score a few cheap points 
against the White House during a polit-
ical season. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I was 
in Alaska when Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett was before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, but since then I have been 
able to catch up on those hearings. I 
want to commend my colleagues, par-
ticularly Senator GRAHAM
for con-
ducting those hearings in a way that 
befitted such an occasion—with respect 
and good questioning. I think the 
American people—certainly my con-
stituents—learned a lot and were very, 
very impressed with Judge Barrett. 
As you know, the advice and consent 
responsibility of the Senate is one of 
the most important responsibilities we 
have in the Constitution. The process 
that I will have gone through and go 
through with every single judge is to 
evaluate Judge Barrett’s qualifications 
on her record, the hearings, and, of 
course, in discussions I have had with 
her. This has been an extensive evalua-
tion. I have read hundreds of pages of 
the decisions she has authored. I have 
listened to and read the views of Alas-
kans both for and against her nomina-
tion. In my meeting with Judge Bar-
rett, we discussed in great depth her 
viewpoint on a variety of national and 
Alaska-focused legal issues. 
She clearly understands the separa-
tion of powers and federalism, holds a 
healthy skepticism regarding the ex-
pansive power of Federal Agencies, and 
is a strong protector and proponent of 
the 
Second 
Amendment—all 
issues 
that 
my 
constituents 
care 
deeply 
about. 
Why are these issues so important to 
Alaska and central to our realizing our 
potential? Let me give a brief but re-
cent example of an issue that recently 
made its way to the Ninth Circuit, 
which often is the bane of our existence 
in Alaska, to the Supreme Court not 
once but twice, and was unanimously 
agreed to by the Supreme Court. It is a 
case that some of the media here would 
be familiar with, Sturgeon v. Frost—a 
moose hunter, a hovercraft, the wild 
interior of Alaska. It made for some 
great headlines. But the issue being 
litigated in that case was one of con-
trol, one of freedom—control of our 
lands, our waters, our fish, and game. 
The Federal Government, in essence, 
told John Sturgeon he couldn’t use his 
hovercraft on Federal waters to go 
hunting. ‘‘Yes, I can,’’ said Sturgeon. 
He knew the law. 
Then there was litigation. It is one 
that comes up time and again in Alas-
ka—the issue of Federal overreach, 
agency creep. In Alaska, we have a 
front row to this problem. 
We have seen it happen to us consist-
ently by the courts—particularly, as I 
mentioned, the judges on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
When they interpret statutes involving 
my State—and they are many—Federal 
statutes can only relate to Alaska in a 
way that fits with their ideas and pol-
icy notions about the way the Federal 
lands in Alaska should be managed. In 
essence, they typically think that less 
control by the people and more control 
by the government is what is needed. 
But that often is not what Congress 
wrote and what Congress intended. It is 
the absolute opposite of judicial humil-
ity, failing to read the statutes as we, 
in this body, wrote them. It is failing 
to exhibit the kind of textualism that 
Judge Barrett ascribes to and was so on 
display during our hearings. 
So why is this important? When the 
Supreme Court overturned the Ninth 
Circuit twice in 3 years, Justice Elena 
Kagan wrote in her opinion for the ma-
jority in Sturgeon v. Frost that the 
Federal laws that govern land manage-
ment in Alaska are often ‘‘different’’ 
from the laws governing land manage-
ment in any other part of the country. 
These laws are often carefully crafted 
by this body and the House, and they 
are essential for Alaskans, both cul-
turally and economically. And when 
judges 
misinterpret 
these 
laws—as 
they often do, and this is what I talked 
to Judge Barrett about—they often di-
rectly impact the lives of my constitu-
ents, usually in a negative way. 
Just ask John Sturgeon and count-
less other Alaskans who, over the dec-
ades, have seen their rights to legally 
enjoy our lands—and it is our lands— 
that they call home whittled away, de-
cision by decision, by Federal agencies. 
Over the years, various Federal agen-
cies have acted as if Federal laws gov-
erning Alaska didn’t exist. Commercial 
use permits weren’t being issued. Peo-
ple couldn’t partake in their tradi-
tional activities. They couldn’t harvest 
their 
traditional 
foods. 
Alaskans 
couldn’t make a living on the land. 
I don’t know how Judge Barrett 
would vote on these specific issues, but 
I trust her temperament, on great dis-
play during the hearings, her stated 
skepticism about Federal overreach, 
her strong belief that the Second 
Amendment 
‘‘confers 
an 
individual 
right, intimately connected with the 
natural right of self-defense.’’ 
I trust what others have said about 
her on both sides of the aisle: ‘‘bril-
liant,’’ ‘‘humble,’’ ‘‘a woman of unas-
sailable integrity,’’ and ‘‘a role model 
for generations to come.’’ 
All of this was on display during her 
hearing and in my meeting with her, 
and I trust that all of this will come to 
play when these kinds of cases—the 
Alaska-specific cases—make their way 
up to the High Court, which they inevi-
tably do. I don’t believe that it is an 
overstatement to say that the future of 
my constituents depends on these 
kinds of issues. 
It is for these reasons, and others, 
that I will vote to confirm Judge Bar-
rett to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to do the same for 
this exceptional jurist who is very 
qualified for this position. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, it 
is an honor to speak in strong support 
of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve 
as an Associate Justice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States. After care-
ful review of her record and her out-
standing testimony during her con-
firmation hearing, it is clear that 
Judge Barrett is well suited for a life-
time appointment on the Court. 
Last week, Judge Barrett firmly held 
her own during hours and hours of 
questioning from my colleagues on the 
Judiciary Committee. She did not once 
falter during her hearing. In fact, she 
excelled. Judge Barrett proved to the

American people that she is prepared, 
talented, compassionate, and, not to 
mention, brilliant. Judge Barrett dem-
onstrated that she is an independent 
individual who can think for herself. 
She made it clear that she is an 
originalist who will follow the law. 
Without a single note or binder in 
front of her, Judge Barrett repeatedly 
affirmed that she would interpret the 
Constitution and laws passed by Con-
gress as they were written—no more, 
no less. 
During her hearing, Judge Barrett 
testified: 
I apply the law. I follow the law. You make 
the policy. 
The judge kept pointing out that we, 
the Senate, are the legislators. She 
stressed that she has no mission or 
agenda to change the law as she would 
want it. Judge Barrett made it abun-
dantly clear that in her role as a jurist, 
she has no issues with setting aside her 
personal beliefs when applying the let-
ter of the law. This mindset and legal 
philosophy is exactly the type of jurist 
we need on our Nation’s highest Court. 
Not only did we hear from Judge Bar-
rett, but we heard from her former pro-
fessors, colleagues, and students. These 
are the people who know her best. 
These individuals were witnesses not 
only to her intellect but her character 
as well. The testimonies on her behalf 
only proved her absolute readiness for 
this position. 
Americans should be celebrating the 
nomination of Judge Barrett. She is 
brilliant, hard working, ambitious, and 
a proud mother and wife. In a time 
when we need role models for our 
youth, Judge Barrett fills that role. 
The 
judge 
is 
a 
family-oriented 
woman who reveres the Constitution. 
She is a representative for working 
women across the country and a testa-
ment that women can have a career 
and family and be stunningly success-
ful at both. 
I also appreciate that she has dis-
played great strength in withstanding 
affronts to her faith and her family 
during the confirmation process. 
If confirmed—and I am confident 
that she will be—Amy Coney Barrett 
will have the honor to be the fifth 
woman in history to serve on the Su-
preme Court. The first judge as a moth-
er of school-aged children, she will be 
the only sitting judge on the Court to 
not have attended an Ivy League law 
school. 
We must continue to ensure that 
women like Judge Barrett are rep-
resented in the highest levels of our ju-
dicial system. Judge Barrett’s life ex-
periences as a judge, lawyer, teacher, 
wife, and mother will bring a valuable 
and much needed perspective to the Su-
preme Court. 
I am proud to support Judge Barrett. 
Now the Senate must do its constitu-
tional duty and confirm Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am so 
proud to be here today to join my col-
leagues to discuss the current Supreme 
Court vacancy and, specifically, the ex-
cellent choice President Trump made 
in selecting Amy Coney Barrett to fill 
that vacancy. 
I, like my colleagues and many 
Americans, watched the Senate Judici-
ary Committee hearings on Judge 
Barrett’s nomination last week. I also 
have had a chance to meet personally 
with the judge myself. During all of 
these occasions, I have been extremely 
impressed with Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett. 
I was especially impressed with her 
depth of legal knowledge, coupled with 
her demeanor. She very clearly and 
eloquently expresses herself. She reit-
erated many times in the hearing that 
judges don’t make the law. She was 
levelheaded, open-minded, and firm in 
all of her responses. 
Judge Barrett is a model of profes-
sional and personal success. We have 
all heard that she is a mother of seven, 
which, in and of itself, is quite an 
achievement. And, if confirmed, she 
will be the first mother of school-aged 
children to serve on the Supreme 
Court. 
She is absolutely dedicated to her 
faith and to her community, and she is 
held in very high regard by the many 
students she has taught and mentored 
over the years. 
You could certainly tell from the 
questioning of the Judiciary Com-
mittee members during that hearing 
that she has been in the arena many 
times with very inquisitive people and 
students. 
In short, Judge Barrett is a stellar 
nominee who will show a new genera-
tion—our daughters and our grand-
daughters—that anything is possible in 
America. 
I plan to vote to confirm Judge Bar-
rett, and here is why. Evaluating nomi-
nees for high government offices is an 
important responsibility for this body 
of Senators. That is even true when the 
nominee is being considered for a life-
time appointment to the Nation’s high-
est Court. So I consider, really, three 
main questions when I am considering 
a Supreme Court nominee. 
First and foremost, is the nominee 
qualified? 
Second, does the nominee have a 
track record of independence and fair-
ness that befits a judge who will apply 
our Constitution and laws as written, 
rather than make policy from the 
bench? 
And, third, do the West Virginians 
whom I represent believe the nominee 
is well suited to decide cases that im-
pact their constitutional rights? 
Based on her impressive resume, 
Judge Barrett is clearly qualified for 
the Supreme Court. The nonpartisan 
American Bar Association rated her 
‘‘well qualified.’’ That is the ABA’s 
highest ranking for judicial nominees. 
Judge Barrett’s judicial philosophy 
and record on the Seventh Circuit are 
those of a mainstream jurist who con-
siders herself bound by the law, not 
free to decide cases based on her own 
personal opinions. She reiterated that 
time and again in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
That is so important because some of 
my Democratic Senate colleagues were 
seeking promises from her about how 
she will rule on certain cases in the fu-
ture, and they sought to examine her 
belief on policy matters, such as pro-
tections for those with preexisting con-
ditions. 
I, for one, strongly support—as most 
of us do—legal protections to make 
sure that individuals with preexisting 
conditions can purchase and retain 
health insurance. Passing laws like 
those are what we should be doing here 
in this body, not in the Supreme Court. 
After some of my colleagues were not 
given the hints that they were looking 
for on how Judge Barrett would rule on 
particular cases, they resorted to as-
suming that they knew what she would 
do. Specifically, they tried to tie Judge 
Barrett to those who had mentored her 
in the past and insinuated that she 
would judge exactly how they would 
judge. Well, when that happened, she 
responded: 
I assure you, I have my own mind. . . . Ev-
erything that he— 
Meaning Scalia— 
said is not necessarily what I would agree 
with or what I would do if I were Justice 
Barrett. 
It is clear that Judge Barrett has her 
own mind and will seek to be a fair and 
impartial judge. The role of judges is to 
apply our Constitution and laws as 
written to the cases before them and 
not implement their own policy agen-
das. As Judge Barrett put it in her own 
words, ‘‘Judges can’t just wake up one 
day and say: ‘I have an agenda . . . [I] 
am going to walk in like a royal queen 
and impose my will on the world.’’ 
Instead, she explained that it is 
‘‘never appropriate for a judge to im-
pose the judge’s personal convictions in 
determining the outcome of a case.’’ 
She also went on to say: 
A judge must apply the law as written. 
Judges are not policymakers, and they must 
be resolute in setting aside any policy views 
they might hold. 
Judge Barrett’s success in applying 
the law is reflected in the fact that 
over 90 percent of the majority opin-
ions she has written were unanimously 
agreed to by her colleagues on the Sev-
enth Circuit. No decision she has writ-
ten has ever been overturned or re-
versed by the Supreme Court. This 
record is only possible when a judge is 
deciding cases fairly and in accord with 
the mainstream views of colleagues ap-
pointed by both Republican and Demo-
cratic Presidents. 
West Virginians want a Supreme 
Court Justice with experience and in-
tegrity who will protect the Constitu-
tion and decide cases fairly. West Vir-
ginians want a Supreme Court Justice 
who will serve as a role model for our 
children and our grandchildren. That is

October 21, 2020 
why I will be proud to vote to confirm 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon in full, complete, and 
all-inspired support for the nomination 
of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an 
Associate 
Justice 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
Her qualifications are not in dispute 
and have been mentioned repeatedly on 
the floor and in other public forums. 
I have had a chance as a Member of 
the Senate to vote on four Associate 
Justices of the Supreme Court: Kagan, 
Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. I 
was a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives down the hall here during 
the confirmations of Justices Alito and 
Roberts, and I was old enough to pay 
close attention to the confirmations of 
Justices Breyer and Thomas. I can say 
to my colleagues today, I have never 
witnessed a more impressive display of 
poise, knowledge, and temperament in 
a candidate for the Supreme Court 
than I have witnessed during the con-
firmation process of this particular 
candidate. I think that is why, perhaps, 
there was objection to the process. 
No doubt there was objection to the 
process in the timing of this nomina-
tion and this confirmation among a lot 
of people around the United States, but 
as the confirmation wore on and as 
more and more people came to know 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett—the stu-
dent, the parent, the member of her 
community—and as more and more 
people have seen her and listened to 
her, public opinion has moved in her 
favor to now where a majority of 
Americans support the elevation and 
confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to 
the Supreme Court. I certainly am de-
lighted to see that and am not sur-
prised based upon the absolutely phe-
nomenal way she has conducted her-
self. 
I think it is worth noting that she is 
from Middle America. While all of our 
50 States are great and all of our law 
schools undoubtedly have things to 
recommend them, I kind of like that 
she grew up in my neighboring State of 
Louisiana. I kind of like that she grad-
uated with stellar marks from a very 
impressive college in my neighboring 
State of Tennessee, at Rhodes College 
in Memphis, TN, just an hour and a 
half up the road from where I make my 
home. 
I think Harvard is a great law school. 
I think Yale is a great law school. I 
think it is OK that we have now a pro-
spective Justice of the Supreme Court 
who went someplace else: Notre Dame. 
So, to me, she represents Middle 
American values, and there is some-
thing to be said for that on the highest 
Court of the land—Louisiana values, 
Tennessee values, Indiana values. 
I think she is an inspiration to young 
women across this country. I have two 
daughters. They have become profes-
sional successes in their own right. I 
have five granddaughters. The oldest 
one is 10. I think Justice Amy Coney 
Barrett will prove to be an inspiration 
to these five granddaughters and to my 
grown daughters also. 
There is much talk about predicting 
how this Justice or how any candidate 
for the circuit court or the district 
court will rule. I have seen enough ex-
amples during my lifetime of surprises 
that I would not venture to guess how 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett is going to 
rule on a particular issue. I do think 
she is committed to interpreting the 
law and to applying the law as it is 
written in the Constitution, as we 
write it as legislators, and not adjust-
ing the law, manipulating it to suit her 
rule, but I have no idea how she will 
rule. 
I do know this, and this is what 
makes me so comfortable with ele-
vating her to one of these nine special 
positions as an Associate Justice of the 
Supreme Court. I know that she is de-
voted to the philosophy of Justice 
Antonin Scalia. 
If Justice Scalia ever made a pro-
found point about our law and our sys-
tem of the rule of law and our Con-
stitution, it was this: We are a special 
republic and a special democracy be-
cause we have enshrined in our Con-
stitution the separation of powers. The 
President has his powers to enforce the 
law. The Congress has the power of the 
purse, and we write the statutes, and 
the Supreme Court rules on the con-
stitutionality and the validity of our 
actions. 
Scalia made this point over and over, 
and it was always such a wonderful ex-
perience to hear him lecture. But if he 
ever made a point, it was this: Any dic-
tator around the world can write down 
on a piece of paper a bill of rights, and 
around the country, in dictatorships 
and totalitarian systems, there are 
many bills of rights. 
The way we ensure that Bill of 
Rights is enforced is that we don’t give 
any one part of our government too 
much power. We don’t give any one 
man or any one institution or any one 
Agency in this Federal Government too 
much power. Those are the checks and 
balances that Antonin Scalia said 
made the United States special. I think 
Amy Coney Barrett understands that, 
and I think she will enforce that con-
cept and be true to those tenets as the 
next Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court. 
So I couldn’t be more delighted, I 
couldn’t be more enthusiastic, I could 
not be any more awe-inspired with a 
candidate for the Supreme Court, and I 
will, with great honor and privilege, 
vote in favor of her confirmation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nomination of 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an As-
sociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Before I begin, I would be remiss if I 
didn’t acknowledge the reason for this 
vacancy. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
dedicated almost three decades of her 
life to serving on the highest Court, 
and she will always be remembered as 
a talented attorney and jurist. We ap-
preciate Justice Ginsburg and her serv-
ice to our Nation. 
Soon the Senate will consider the 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett to serve as Associate Justice on 
the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett has 
an outstanding record of accomplish-
ment, as well as a strong record of up-
holding the law rather than legislating 
from the bench. 
Judge Barrett graduated summa cum 
laude, first in her class, from Notre 
Dame Law School. She then clerked for 
Judge Silberman on the DC Circuit and 
Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
She currently serves as a circuit 
court judge for the Seventh Circuit. 
During her time on the Seventh Cir-
cuit, she has written 79 majority opin-
ions. She has also published 18 law re-
view articles. I wanted to take a mo-
ment to mention this list of accom-
plishments to highlight how remark-
able she is as an attorney and as a ju-
rist. 
I had the opportunity to sit down 
with Judge Barrett to discuss her judi-
cial philosophy. She is an originalist 
and a textualist. Her traditional phi-
losophy ensures her own personal be-
liefs and her views will not impact her 
role as a jurist. 
As a Senator, I strive to ensure we 
confirm judges who will be impartial in 
their rulings and will take the facts 
presented and apply the law to those 
facts. 
During our conversation, we dis-
cussed the principle of precedent and 
how precedent is important for judicial 
structure. Judge Barrett believes that, 
as a judge, her main duty is to the U.S. 
Constitution and to ensuring that all 
judicial opinions uphold the rights, 
freedoms, and principles established in 
this essential document. 
Judge Barrett’s judicial approach en-
sures she will be fair and impartial to-
ward every plaintiff who comes before 
her and, at the same time, that our 
most vital document—our Constitu-
tion—is upheld and echoed in every ju-
dicial opinion she makes. 
Judges 
should 
never 
have 
pre-
conceived notions, and they should not 
be able to provide a prediction or any 
sort of hint as to how they will decide 
a future or hypothetical case. A judge’s 
judicial philosophy ensures they have 
the proper tools at their disposal for 
reaching decisions. Judges’ decisions 
impact lives, and it is important for 
our jurists to be fair, level-minded, and 
impartial at all times. That is why 
having someone like Judge Barrett on 
the Supreme Court is best for our Na-
tion. 
Another topic I discussed with Judge 
Barrett was the importance of uphold-
ing our Federal trust and treaty obli-
gations to our Tribes. As chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Indian Af-
fairs, I understand the importance of

upholding these responsibilities. Judge 
Barrett said that she will objectively 
look at every case that comes before 
her, will apply the law to the facts at 
hand, and will do her part to uphold 
the Federal trust and treaty responsi-
bility. 
Judge Barrett has not only estab-
lished an outstanding record of accom-
plishment on the bench, but she has 
also demonstrated her deep under-
standing of the law as a professor at 
Notre Dame Law School. Throughout 
her career, Judge Barrett has shown a 
deep respect for the Constitution, as 
well as a strong commitment to up-
holding the law. 
Judge Barrett is a great choice to 
join the bench of the Supreme Court. 
Her qualifications, judicial approach, 
and commitment to upholding the Con-
stitution will benefit my home State of 
North Dakota, as well as our entire Na-
tion. Judge Barrett will be a strong, 
fair, and impartial Justice, and I look 
forward to supporting her nomination. 
The Supreme Court is foundational 
to the checks and balances structure of 
our government—something that the 
good Senator from Mississippi just 
talked about very eloquently. Having 
an independent judicial body is crucial 
to the protection of our democracy. 
Justices of the Supreme Court hold 
the essential role of being the final de-
cisionmaker of disputes in the United 
States. Such power comes with much 
responsibility, which is why selecting 
the best person for this job is critical 
for our country. We must have Justices 
on our Supreme Court who uphold the 
law and interpret the Constitution in 
the way it was written. 
Again, 
I 
appreciate 
President 
Trump’s nomination of Judge Barrett, 
and I look forward to supporting her 
confirmation to serve as an Associate 
Justice on the Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I am one of the few Senators who have 
appointed people to the bench, and I 
take this very seriously. I believe in se-
lecting judges who respect the separa-
tion of powers and the proper role of 
the judiciary in our democratic sys-
tem. 
Their job isn’t to make policy; it is 
to uphold the rule of law. We can’t 
have judicial activism—something my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
refuse to accept. The Democrats have 
made it clear they care more about the 
election than performing their con-
stitutional duty to confirm judges. Be-
cause the Democrats only want judicial 
activists, they can’t understand a 
judge who has no plan to change the 
law and the Constitution to align with 
their personal beliefs about how Ameri-
cans should be governed. The Demo-
crats won’t engage in this process even 
though they know Judge Barrett is 
highly qualified. 
When I was appointing judges as Gov-
ernor, I would ask each candidate one 
question: Do you understand your role 
and the distinct branches of govern-
ment? Do you want to make policy, or 
do you want to uphold the law as writ-
ten? 
That is exactly what I asked Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett when we met. She 
could not have been more clear in our 
meeting and throughout the Judiciary 
Committee hearings last week. Judge 
Barrett is a nominee of indisputable 
credentials and qualifications and will 
fulfill the proper role of a judge envi-
sioned by the Framers when they de-
signed the three-branch system of gov-
ernment in our Constitution. 
The Democratic attempts to attack 
Judge Barrett for her faith fell flat. 
Quite the opposite, her faith and her 
commitment to family have earned her 
the utmost respect. The Democrats 
were left grasping at straws during last 
week’s hearing because they clearly 
can’t question her qualifications. 
Her 
record 
is 
irrefutable. 
Judge 
Barrett’s academic, professional, and 
judicial records clearly demonstrate 
her devotion to following the rule of 
law. She strictly adheres to the origi-
nal meaning of the Constitution’s pro-
visions, setting forth the fundamental 
rights, liberties, and protections on 
which this great country was founded. 
As 
Professor 
Prakash 
eloquently 
stated in Judge Barrett’s nomination 
hearing, the ABA’s rating of Judge 
Barrett as ‘‘well qualified’’ is an under-
statement. I am proud to support 
Judge Barrett’s nomination, and I look 
forward to voting to confirm her to 
serve as an Associate Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, shortly, I 
will offer a unanimous consent request 
on legislation to extend enhanced un-
employment insurance for folks in 
America who are out of work. 
I am going to begin with a quick 
check-in on the economic reality in our 
country. Here is where we are in a sen-
tence: Only half of the jobs lost earlier 
this year have actually come back; the 
other half may never come back. There 
is substantial evidence that many of 
these jobs will be lost forever. 
The permanent layoffs are stacking 
up. Right now, 25 million Americans 
are receiving unemployment insurance. 
Their insurance payments were slashed 
when Republicans let enhanced unem-
ployment insurance expire at the end 
of July. 
Here is a particularly important fact. 
The number of Americans filing new 
claims for unemployment insurance is 
still higher than any single week dur-
ing the great recession. Upward of 8 
million Americans have fallen into 
poverty over just the last few months. 
In the month of September alone—just 
September—nearly 1 million women 
dropped out of the workforce. To make 
matters worse, the pandemic that is 
causing all of this economic carnage is 
just 
getting 
worse 
as 
the 
fall 
coronavirus wave begins to rise across 
the country. 
The restaurant and bar industry has 
been hurt, and the travel industry, the 
live entertainment industry. We are 
talking about millions and millions of 
workers who are out of a job right now, 
plus millions more who are worried 
that they are going to get laid off this 
winter as COVID–19 infections rise. 
The fact is, despite what Donald 
Trump says, our economy isn’t any-
where near fully recovered—not even 
close. This jobs crisis won’t be over 
until the public health crisis is over. 
That is why, in the meantime, the only 
reasonable and logical thing to do is to 
bring back enhanced unemployment in-
surance and keep those benefits for the 
duration of the emergency. That is 
what I am calling for this afternoon. 
That is what I believe Members of Con-
gress should be for. 
The proposal that I offer extends the 
crucial programs from the CARES 
Act—the extra $600 per week, what we 
developed in the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. I see the distinguished Repub-
lican 
leader, 
Senator 
THUNE, 
who 
serves on our committee. We work to-
gether often. We developed it there— 
the extra $600 per week, Pandemic Un-
employment Assistance for the self- 
employed, and additional benefits for 
them. 
My God, the unemployment system 
was actually brought into this century. 
The old system was close to 100 years 
old. Nobody ever heard back then of a 
gig worker, but we got them covered. 
So we want to extend those programs 
until January 31, 2021. In addition to 
the enhanced unemployment benefits, 
what this does is it avoids throwing 
millions and millions of Americans 
over a financial cliff, essentially, at 
the end of the year. 
It is my judgment that this is just 
basic economic fairness. This is about 
making sure that tens of millions of 
Americans who walk an economic 
tightrope during this pandemic will be 
able to pay the rent, put food on the 
table, and buy medicine. Tens of mil-
lions of Americans, from sea to shining 
sea—from Portland, OR, to Portland, 
ME—desperately need this lifeline. 
Continuing to block an extension of 
enhanced unemployment insurance, in 
my view, is the economic equivalent of 
going for herd immunity with COVID– 
19—telling the most vulnerable people 
out there that they are, in effect, on 
their own; that their government has 
no interest in standing up for them. 
From the beginning of this pandemic, 
my colleagues on the other side have 
opposed the enhanced unemployment 
insurance concept that I am talking 
about. Back in March, Senate Demo-
crats said replacing people’s lost wages 
was going to be right up at the top of 
our priorities list for the CARES Act. I 
consider it one of the most important 
efforts I have been part of during my 
time in public service, and we were all 
able to get it in the bill. It turned out

it was the only provision that the Re-
publican majority attempted to re-
move. 
Just process that for a moment. We 
had a debate on the floor of the Senate. 
There was only one thing Senate Re-
publicans wanted to remove. They 
wanted to remove the provision I am 
describing that would give millions of 
Americans who are hurting the oppor-
tunity to make rent and buy groceries 
and get their kids sneakers and pay for 
medicine. I am still incredulous about 
this, but, actually, one Member of the 
minority came up to me before we 
voted and said: RON, what you are talk-
ing about is going to cause nurses to 
leave their jobs now during the pan-
demic and go into retirement and get 
unemployment. And I said: You have to 
be kidding. I handed the Senator the 
article from the local paper that de-
scribed how nurses were actually com-
ing out of retirement to work during 
the pandemic because they cared so 
deeply about their community. 
Fortunately, that Republican effort 
that night to gut the expanded unem-
ployment benefits failed, and now I 
think we have people from across the 
political spectrum saying that that 
program has turned out to be one of 
the most successful safety net pro-
grams in decades—in decades. 
For months, Republicans have been 
repeating the same story about why 
they oppose the expanded unemploy-
ment insurance. They say it is because 
what we did is holding back the econ-
omy—that it is a disincentive to work 
and lazy workers are choosing to sit at 
home 
collecting 
insurance. 
Wrong, 
wrong, wrong. It was wrong from the 
beginning, and it now should be obvi-
ous. 
Enhanced unemployment insurance 
expired at the end of July—July 31. If 
those insurance payments were really 
shackling our economy and being a dis-
incentive to work, then, why wasn’t 
there a megaboom in hiring in August? 
The fact is that job growth shot down 
immediately after enhanced unemploy-
ment insurance expired, and it plum-
meted in September. 
The reasons to bring back enhanced 
unemployment insurance ought to be 
clear: It is the right thing to do in 
terms of economic fairness for workers. 
And the main argument against en-
hanced unemployment insurance has 
been proven wrong. 
Finally, renewing enhanced unem-
ployment insurance is absolutely key 
to protecting our public health. The 
pandemic is raging now. Cases are 
going up. There are hotspots all over 
the map. We are in what so many of 
the experts say is the tip of the third 
wave of the virus: cold weather coming 
up, folks being indoors. And in some 
parts of the country, mayors or Gov-
ernors may soon face the possibility 
that certain areas could go back into 
lockdown. Business owners might begin 
to wonder if staying open is too dan-
gerous a prospect—particularly, if you 
are talking about places like res-
taurants and cafes. Taking the steps 
needed to crush the virus is going to be 
a lot easier if workers have the back-
stop of enhanced unemployment insur-
ance so they have the money—in South 
Dakota, in Oregon, and every part of 
the country—to make rent and pay for 
groceries. 
Blocking 
enhanced 
unemployment 
insurance creates a disincentive to 
crush the virus with strong action and 
will lead to more people spending more 
time in more hotspots, perpetuating 
both the tragedy of the pandemic as 
well as the tragedy of our anemic eco-
nomic recovery. 
I will close with this. It does not 
have to be this way. There is a lot 
more work to be done. State and local 
governments need more funding for 
hospitals and testing. We need support 
for our schools. We need support for 
basic municipal services. There ought 
to be more opportunities to talk about 
those issues in the days ahead. 
Right now, passage of enhanced un-
employment insurance is long overdue. 
I see my friend from South Dakota, 
with whom I have worked often in the 
Finance Committee. We have been on 
this floor again and again over the last 
few months talking about this. 
I offered a proposal with the distin-
guished Democratic leader, Senator 
SCHUMER. We thought that was some-
thing that would be appealing to both 
sides. But the bottom line is for this 
Chamber, as we are looking at the 
coronavirus spike again, to say that we 
are not going to stand up for people 
who are just trying to make rent and 
pay for groceries. 
Somebody asked me at home. I was 
just at home. I got into virtually every 
nook and cranny in my State over the 
last couple of weeks in a socially dis-
tant way. People said: What do I see 
people spend the unemployment money 
on? They said: They all seem to be in 
the grocery store. I said: They are pay-
ing for rent and groceries and essen-
tials. They sure aren’t using unemploy-
ment money to buy scarves or fancy 
things from overseas. They are using it 
for essentials. My view is, the Senate 
has no choice but to extend the en-
hanced unemployment insurance. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of my bill to provide contin-
ued assistance to unemployed workers, 
which is at the desk; I further ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read three times and passed, 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Is there objection? 
The Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to 
object, I just want to say, because my 
colleague from Oregon—as he pointed 
out, he and I work closely together on 
a number of issues—trade issues, tax 
issues, 
particularly 
in 
the 
digital 
space. I know he is a person who tries 
to find common ground, tries to find 
bipartisan solutions. I appreciate that, 
and I hope there are a lot more issues 
in the future that we can work on to-
gether as members of the Finance 
Committee. He is the ranking Demo-
crat on the committee. I hope we can 
work together and find some things we 
can do that are good for our economy. 
What he is proposing right now is to 
extend unemployment insurance bene-
fits at $600 a week. Democrats have 
said they don’t want to do a piecemeal 
approach. Yet that is exactly what is 
being offered right now. I guess the 
question is, What has changed? Less 
than 2 hours ago, my Democratic col-
leagues blocked not just extending ad-
ditional Federal unemployment bene-
fits but also providing more paycheck 
help for small businesses through the 
PPP program, funding for schools and 
universities to reopen, more money for 
testing and vaccine development, help 
for the U.S. Postal Service, and relief 
for farmers. I would argue they are all 
bipartisan priorities. This should be a 
no-brainer. 
What is ironic about it is that our po-
sition on this all along has been that 
just because we can’t do everything 
doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do some-
thing. The Democratic position seems 
to be that just because we can’t do ev-
erything, we would rather do nothing. 
We think the American people are pay-
ing the price for that. 
So instead of supporting our com-
prehensive package, which deals with 
all the issues that I mentioned—all of 
which, I might add, are bipartisan pri-
orities—we have a proposal here that I 
think, frankly, is stuck in the past. 
For example, this bill would restart 
extra unemployment payments that 
gave most people more money not to 
work than to work. 
Just to correct the record about one 
point my colleague from Oregon made, 
the amendment offered by Republicans 
when the CARES package was being 
considered wasn’t to gut the unemploy-
ment program. The Senator from Or-
egon fought very hard to get that pro-
vision in the CARES package. There 
was an amendment offered on the floor 
that would have calibrated that Fed-
eral unemployment benefit to what an 
individual is making—in other words, 
100 percent wage replacement. That is 
what was in that proposal, and it was 
voted down on a party-line vote. 
If you look at what the CBO esti-
mates, 80 percent of people would be 
paid more for not working if the $600- 
per-week benefit were continued. It is 
not just a few dollars more. There was 
a recent study under the $600 plus-up 
that 
median 
unemployed 
workers 
would receive a benefit of 145 percent 
of their prior wage. In South Dakota, I 
will tell you that the median wage re-
placement rate was 155 percent. Think 
about that. If you are making $30,000, 
making minimum wage—$15 an hour, 
$30,000 a year—in my State of South 
Dakota, under the Senator from Or-
egon’s proposal, that individual would

make $45,000 a year. That is 150 percent 
of wages or north of that. One hundred 
and fifty-five percent is the median 
wage replacement in my State of South 
Dakota. Consider what the incentives 
are for that person making $30,000 
working or $45,000 not working. 
My dad just passed away in August. 
He was 100 years old. He used to say: 
Some things, JOHN, are just kind of 
old-fashioned horse sense. I think in 
this case, this is someplace where you 
can apply old-fashioned horse sense. If 
you offer somebody a benefit that dra-
matically exceeds—not by just a little 
but by a lot—what they would be mak-
ing if they were working, obviously 
you can see what would happen there. 
I would point out that when I went 
back for my father’s funeral in August, 
in the middle of the travel season in 
South Dakota—normally an incredibly 
busy time—there were little eating 
places in my hometown that weren’t 
open. Why? They couldn’t find workers. 
I have talked to them about that and 
talked to a lot of small businesses in 
my State. I think the $600 payment has 
acted as a tremendous disincentive for 
people to come back into the workforce 
when there might be jobs available. 
The $600 ended about 3 months ago. 
Yet the same idea is being offered up 
even though the unemployment rate 
has fallen. In April, it was 14.7 percent. 
In September, it was 7.9 percent. In my 
State of South Dakota, it is 4.1 per-
cent. The idea that with the economy 
recovering we would now come back to 
pay people more for not working than 
working seems to be counterintuitive. 
Again, our plan, which was opposed 
by the Democrats 2 hours ago, would 
have provided an additional $300-per- 
week payment through the end of the 
year. That is real help that could be 
made available right now. 
Even without this additional $300 
payment, some expanded unemploy-
ment 
benefits 
are 
still 
available 
through December. If you look at—the 
Senator from Oregon mentioned self- 
employed, independent contractors, gig 
workers who are not normally eligible 
for unemployment. They are going to 
get that help through December. 
Given the problems with this bill and 
because it doesn’t address the broader 
issues that I enumerated earlier, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, just 
to respond to the Senator from South 
Dakota, it has always been a bedrock 
argument from Senate Republicans 
that somehow unemployment insur-
ance is a disincentive for people to 
work. If that were the case—unemploy-
ment benefits expired in July, July 31. 
If somehow those unemployment bene-
fits were shackling the economy, cre-
ating 
disincentives 
to 
work, 
why 
wasn’t there a mega boom in the work-
force in August? The reason is pretty 
obvious: Those unemployment benefits 
were not a disincentive. That has been 
the case as well into September and 
October. 
The one thing I do want to take ex-
ception to with respect to my col-
league’s remarks is—he said Repub-
licans never sought to gut the $600. 
That is just not accurate. On the floor, 
the Republicans wanted to take out 
that amount, which everybody was 
going to get, and replace it with some-
thing that was completely unworkable 
and wouldn’t have gotten benefits to 
unemployed workers quickly. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. Eugene Scalia, the Secretary of 
Labor, during days and days of negotia-
tions, as we talked about the concept 
the Senator from South Dakota has 
raised, the whole notion of wage re-
placement, the Secretary of Labor said, 
can’t be done. The States don’t have 
the technology to do it. 
Those discussions went on for days 
because Republicans were insistent on 
going with this wage-replacement idea, 
which has now been characterized by a 
Republican labor official in Georgia as 
one of the dumbest ideas he had heard 
of because it was so unworkable. 
Finally, I said that we are not going 
to stiff these workers, so we will take 
an average. Some people will get more 
than they normally would; some people 
would get less than they normally 
would from their wage and benefits. We 
will take an average, but, by God, the 
checks will get out quickly to people 
who had been sent home through no 
fault of their own. They were quar-
antined, as we all know, because we 
were desperate to beat the virus. Peo-
ple would have that money for gro-
ceries and rent. 
That is why we went with $600, be-
cause the idea that my colleague from 
South Dakota has spoken about today 
and that Republicans always talk 
about was declared by the Republican 
Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, as 
being unworkable, and if we were going 
to get a check to people in a timely 
way, we had to go with the $600. 
My staff and I put it together. We 
used this smartphone to make the cal-
culations. We showed it to Secretary 
Mnuchin because it stayed within the 
budget limits. And that was how we got 
to $600. It was the only way to get an 
unemployment check out to people 
quickly. 
Thank goodness the Republican mo-
tion to strip it was defeated because 
had the Republicans won, there would 
have been a lot of people during those 
4 months—essentially ending July 31— 
who couldn’t have made rent, couldn’t 
have paid for groceries. That is just 
plain old wrong. 
We are going to continue to work in 
a bipartisan way. My colleague and I 
agree on the point that we want to do 
big things in the Finance Committee. 
We have to work in a bipartisan way. 
I just say to the Presiding Officer and 
my colleagues, to go back to what my 
friend from South Dakota says is the 
way to go even though the Secretary of 
Labor said it couldn’t be done is a mis-
take. That is why we have advocated 
going with something that we know 
worked and provided an awful lot of re-
lief to people and does not create a dis-
incentive to work. If it did, when it ex-
pired, we would have had a hiring boom 
in August. That wasn’t the case. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. I would simply point out 
that the bill that we voted on and the 
Democrats all voted against earlier 
today did include a formula not unlike 
what the Senator from Oregon is sug-
gesting, and that is a flat payment on 
top of the standard unemployment ben-
efit. It was a $300 payment as opposed 
to a $600 payment. That would not be 
complicated to implement. 
The amendment that was offered 
when the CARES Act passed was a full 
wage replacement. There were concerns 
about whether that could be imple-
mented by the Department of Labor, to 
be fair. But honestly, if you think 
about it, I am not sure what would be 
terribly 
complicated 
about 
having 
somebody come in and asking ‘‘What 
do you make? Show me what you 
make’’ and then saying ‘‘OK. That is 
what you are going to get for a ben-
efit—100 percent wage replacement.’’ 
To me, that makes sense. 
Again, I would come back to the idea 
that if you pay somebody more not to 
work than to work—people naturally— 
I think we all do—respond to incen-
tives. It seems pretty crazy to suggest 
that you could offer people 150 per-
cent—or more in my State of South 
Dakota—of what they were making 
while working, in the form of a benefit, 
and not have them say ‘‘Gee, I can 
make 150-some percent more not work-
ing than working’’ and decide to take 
that benefit. I think that is what we 
run into. That is the economic disrup-
tion created by what the Senator from 
Oregon is suggesting. 
To his point about jobs coming back, 
that is exactly the point I made ear-
lier. The unemployment rate in April 
was 14.7 percent. In September, it was 
7.9 percent. Jobs are coming back. In 
my State of South Dakota, it is 4.1 per-
cent. The economy is trending in the 
right direction as it starts to open up 
again. There is demand out there for 
labor. When the demand for labor goes 
up, the price for labor goes up. That is 
what I think you will continue to see. 
I believe, along with the Senator 
from Oregon, that we need to help peo-
ple who are unemployed. The bill that 
was just voted down by the Democrats 
would have done that at a $300 benefit 
above and beyond what the State un-
employment insurance program pays. 
In most States, that is about 90 percent 
of wage replacement. To suggest that 
the Republicans are being heartless 
just isn’t true. 
Obviously, the amendment that we 
offered back in March when the CARES 
Act was being considered had 100 per-
cent wage replacement. It seems like a 
very intuitive, practical thing to do to

say we are going to replace what you 
were making when you were working. 
Obviously, the proposal voted down 
by the Democrats today had the State 
unemployment insurance benefits plus 
a $300 plus-up, which, again, is about 90 
percent wage replacement. 
So I think what the Senator from Or-
egon is suggesting here is, No. 1, we do 
this piecemeal after his side has been 
saying we have to have a comprehen-
sive approach. Secondly, he is calling 
up an amendment that, frankly, we 
have kind of moved beyond now. We 
are in a different place in the economy. 
We still need to help people who are 
unemployed, but we don’t need to en-
courage people not to work because it 
would pay them more—the government 
would pay them more than they would 
make if they were working. To me, 
that sounds counterintuitive. I think 
the American people get that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, just 
very briefly, my friend from South Da-
kota said I had called Republicans 
‘‘heartless.’’ That was not my word, 
but when Americans who have a great 
work ethic and believe, as my friend 
from Ohio has always talked about, in 
the dignity of work but can’t get jobs 
and can’t make rent and can’t pay for 
groceries, I don’t think we should say, 
when they need a loaf of bread: Well, 
we will just settle for a slice. 
The people I met in Oregon all 
through last week desperately want to 
work. They know that it is the path of 
upward mobility in the private econ-
omy. Yet, as we have seen, lots of jobs 
are gone. You can go down Main 
Streets, and there is barely a car mov-
ing. That is why we have said, as my 
friend from Ohio always talks about, 
when those workers believe deeply in 
the importance of work, and they 
know, by the way, that it is the only 
way they can secure upward mobility 
in the private economy. When they 
can’t do it as a result of this pandemic, 
which is spiking again, we don’t think 
it is wrong to make sure people get a 
sufficient benefit to pay rent and buy 
groceries. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I no-
tice of the Presiding Officer and the 
junior Senator from Arkansas, who was 
the Presiding Officer right before, and 
far too often of the Presiding Officers 
that they are taking their masks off 
when they preside. I notice that right 
below the Presiding Officer are always 
three or four staff people who are fully 
masked. I also know that a number of 
our colleagues have been diagnosed 
with the coronavirus. 
I would hope that the Presiding Offi-
cers, starting today, would wear masks 
when they preside. As they speak and 
project, it puts people at risk who sit 
right below the Presiding Officer. I 
know it might offend the President of 
the United States that the Presiding 
Officer wears a mask when presiding 
because I know the President doesn’t 
believe in it, but public health officials 
in Tennessee and Arkansas and Ohio 
and Oregon and Hawaii do. So I ask 
this of the Presiding Officer and would 
hope the Presiding Officer and others 
will consider public health when they 
preside over this body. 
Before I address my issue—and I will 
note when Senator CRAPO has shown up 
on the floor to address—I want to point 
out a couple of things that I just heard 
from 
Senator 
THUNE
and 
Senator 
WYDEN. 
Senator WYDEN is exactly right. The 
only amendment to the $2.5 trillion 
package that the Republicans offered 
was to strip away the $600. 
I have always been puzzled by how 
much the Republicans as a party—al-
most since Roosevelt—have hated un-
employment insurance. 
I know you don’t like social insur-
ance. You don’t like Medicare, but you 
pay into Medicare, and then you get a 
benefit when you need it. You pay into 
Social Security and get a benefit when 
you need it. You pay into unemploy-
ment insurance and get a benefit when 
you need it. 
I know the Republicans say they 
don’t like Medicare, but every time 
they have a chance, they try to pri-
vatize Medicare. 
Right, Senator WYDEN? 
Then they try to privatize Social Se-
curity, right? 
I can’t believe the number of Repub-
licans I have heard, when they have 
come to the floor, either publicly say 
or privately grumble to themselves or 
each other: I can’t believe this $600 a 
week for these people. We shouldn’t be 
giving that much money to these peo-
ple. 
I mean, that was the tone of voice. 
There was, perhaps, derision in their 
voices. 
I was talking to an unemployed 
worker today who has lost her job, and 
she is hurting. I mean, fortunately she 
has a spouse, and her spouse has insur-
ance, but she was talking about the 
$600 she got. It has also helped local 
businesses. A whole bunch of people in 
my communities are getting the $600 a 
week, and it keeps these businesses 
going too. 
I guess I don’t understand the Repub-
lican hatred of unemployment insur-
ance. I would think it would be 
trumped—pardon 
my 
verb—by 
how 
much it helps small businesses, but I 
guess it is not. So that debate, I guess, 
is over. 
I will also note that, when we were 
giving the $600 a week, one study 
showed it kept 12 million people out of 
poverty. But I guess everything is OK. 
The stock market is back up, so Trump 
and MCCONNELL seem to think every-
thing is fine. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Madam President, I thank my col-
leagues for joining me on the floor 
today to be voices for the millions of 
people who are frustrated and angry 
because President Trump and Senator 
MCCONNELL continue to fail to get this 
pandemic under control. 
The stock market is back up, so 
Trump and MCCONNELL seem to think 
everything is fine. They are oblivious 
to the families who are staring at 
stacks of bills, who can’t pay their 
rent, who have to run up credit cards, 
who go to payday lenders—who don’t 
know what to do. There are 600,000 peo-
ple in my State who lost their unem-
ployment insurance in August. What 
are they supposed to do? 
Senator MCCONNELL
and President 
Trump are oblivious to the parents who 
are under an overwhelming amount of 
stress. They try to do their jobs, juggle 
remote learning, and worry about 
whether their schools are safe. They 
are oblivious to the layoffs that keep 
coming, especially in local govern-
ments and school systems. 
It just didn’t have to be this bad. We 
are the greatest, wealthiest country on 
Earth. What good is it if we can’t rise 
to meet a moment like this? 
Trump and MCCONNELL want you to 
believe that we can’t solve big prob-
lems, that we can’t use our resources 
to help ordinary families, that we can’t 
use our talent to produce tests and 
PPE, and that we can’t use our inge-
nuity to figure out how to open busi-
nesses and schools safely. 
A half a million Ohioans are out of 
work, and 220,000 Americans are dead. 
Yet MCCONNELL and Trump have sim-
ply said: Not our problem. You are on 
your own. I mean, that is the story of 
this Senate unless you have a family 
member who is going to be confirmed 
as a Federal judge. Other than that, 
you are on your own. They want you to 
believe it is the best America can do. 
I think we can do big things. I think 
we can actually solve problems for the 
people we serve. We did it in the spring 
when we put $600 a week in the pockets 
of people who lost their jobs and kept 
millions out of poverty. We put in 
place an eviction moratorium, and we 
gave people stimulus checks to spend 
in this economy, but then MCCONNELL 
and Trump let it all expire. Families 
are now forced to choose between rent 
and utility bills and between food and 
prescriptions. 
Yet nobody around here does. I un-
derstand that. Nobody here has to 
choose between food and prescriptions 
or between rent and utility bills. No-
body here does, but a whole lot of peo-
ple in our States do. So they are turn-
ing to payday lenders and getting 
trapped in cycles of debt. They are 
going to lose their homes. One-sixth of 
renters are behind on rent right now. 
That is 11 million people. Most of them 
are behind on rent because they have 
lost their unemployment checks and 
don’t have any place to turn. 
Even with that, extending UI would 
not be enough. It doesn’t help you if 
you still have a job but have had your 
hours cut back. It doesn’t help recent 
college grads or recent high school 
grads. It doesn’t help if you are self- 
employed or are working odd jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6356 
October 21, 2020 
As Senator WYDEN said, we simply 
haven’t modernized our unemployment 
system well enough. The CDC’s evic-
tion moratorium is also not enough. 
Without the dollars to back it up, it is 
only going to lead to a wave of evic-
tions come the new year. We need to 
get money directly to the people so 
they may pay these bills or there will 
be a wave of evictions in the middle of 
a pandemic. 
Hundreds of thousands of people a 
week are dropping into poverty, and we 
know that the $600 kept a lot of people 
out. Now people are dropping into pov-
erty, so there is going to be a wave of 
evictions, and that wave of evictions is 
going to come. No. 1, it is terrible to be 
evicted anyway. No. 2, it is more ter-
rible to be evicted in the middle of the 
winter. No. 3, it is even more terrible 
to be evicted in the middle of the win-
ter in the middle of a pandemic. How 
can we sit here and allow that to hap-
pen? 
Even now, with the Trump adminis-
tration’s flawed eviction moratorium, 
evictions are happening. We see stories 
every day across the country, and more 
evictions are coming in January. The 
work we do in this body to get help to 
people can’t make up for the lack of 
leadership from the White House, but 
we could mitigate some of the damage. 
The House did its job and passed the 
Heroes Act a few months ago. Over and 
over, I don’t see a sense of urgency in 
MCCONNELL and Trump. They have ig-
nored the families. They have told the 
families: You are on your own. 
This month, the House again passed a 
bill to help families make ends meet. It 
provides the help for renters that I 
come to the floor to offer today. The 
bill contains $50 billion in emergency 
rental 
assistance. 
It 
extends 
the 
CARES Act and the eviction morato-
rium to virtually all renters through 
March. It will protect families, and it 
will protect public health so that it 
will not just be those families who are 
protected from eviction; it will be all 
of us around those families who could 
suffer from a compromise in public 
health. It will also give renters and 
property owners the help they need to 
pay their bills. 
Senate Republicans have refused to 
consider it and the bill that I offer here 
today. The multimillionaire majority 
leader and his caucus have the audac-
ity to tell people who have lost their 
jobs and the audacity to tell essential 
workers making $10 or $12 an hour that 
it is too expensive to give them help to 
pay their bills in the middle of a na-
tional crisis. It is never too expensive 
to help Wall Street. It is never too ex-
pensive for a corporate tax cut. It is 
never too expensive to help the people 
who are in charge, but it is too expen-
sive to help the people who are making 
$10 or $12 an hour. 
People are exhausted. They are tired 
of feeling like no one is on their side. 
The American people shouldn’t have to 
fend for themselves in the middle of a 
once-in-a-generation crisis. That is es-
sentially what the President and the 
majority leader are telling people: You 
are on your own. You are on your own. 
You are on your own. 
It means we should be helping fami-
lies pay the bills and stay in their 
homes. It means bringing back the $600 
UI. It means getting support to our 
schools and communities so they can 
open. It means helping small busi-
nesses. It means putting money in peo-
ple’s pockets. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of my bill to provide 
emergency rental assistance and rental 
market stabilization and to provide a 
temporary moratorium on eviction fil-
ings, which is at the desk. I further ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read three times and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in re-
serving the right to object, it is re-
markable that we see here a series of 
unanimous consent requests to pass 
legislation without debate and without 
the opportunity for amendment and 
improvement. It is just a few hours 
after a refusal to proceed to legislation 
by which we could have done just 
that—legislation that had $500 billion 
of additional assistance going out to 
the American people. Legislation that 
did 
address 
these 
unemployment 
issues—and that has been discussed 
over the last 45 minutes on the floor— 
was objected to so that we couldn’t 
even get on the bill. 
Following NANCY PELOSI’s ‘‘take it or 
leave it,’’ ‘‘my way or the highway’’ 
approach, we are now here, seeing our 
colleagues on the other side pick up 
pieces of the legislation that NANCY 
PELOSI wants to pass without negoti-
ating and without working through the 
legislative process to see if they can 
drive those through the Senate and ob-
ject to not doing them in regular legis-
lative order. 
We are ready to engage in major leg-
islation. Yet a couple of hours after we 
tried for the second or third time to 
put it on the floor—and had that oppor-
tunity refused by my colleagues on the 
other side—we are accused of not work-
ing on these issues, and the ‘‘take it or 
leave it’’ proposals from the House- 
passed legislation are being thrown on 
the floor of the Senate. 
Let’s talk about the current one—the 
proposal for rental assistance and evic-
tion protection for those who need help 
in housing markets. I will say now that 
they need help. As I said the last time 
this effort was tried, they need help, 
and we need to work together instead 
of just trying to lob NANCY PELOSI’s 
bill into the Senate when we can’t get 
agreement to even put a major $500 bil-
lion relief package on the floor for de-
bate and consideration. 
Six months ago, this body came to-
gether and unanimously passed a pack-
age that provided historic, unprece-
dented support to the housing market 
both for homeowners and renters alike. 
We gave the majority of homeowners in 
this country the option of hitting the 
pause button on their mortgage pay-
ments. We prohibited foreclosures and 
evictions across a wide swath of the 
marketplace, which was recently ex-
panded by the CDC to cover an even 
broader portion of the market, and we 
have extended it through the end of 
2020. President Trump, through his Ex-
ecutive orders, has extended this fur-
ther. 
We have appropriated in excess of $12 
billion in supplemental funding to spe-
cifically enhance Federal housing pro-
grams. We have provided $150 billion in 
funding to States and local govern-
ments through the coronavirus relief 
fund, or CRF, a significant portion of 
which has been used for rental assist-
ance. 
We worked together in a bipartisan 
way on the CARES Act. I wish we could 
work on this next act the way we 
worked then, but, no, it is take it or 
leave it. And we are capable of doing 
the same in coming days if we can sim-
ply get on the legislation in the Sen-
ate. 
As I have said before on this floor, I 
agree that we can and should do more 
to help in rental markets, to help those 
who are most vulnerable and who are 
most at risk of eviction, but passing 
this bill—take it or leave it—that re-
ceived no Republican support in the 
House, was just jammed through the 
House on a partisan vote, is not the 
way this body ought to do its work. 
The same thing goes for any blanket 
moratorium—that is what is being pro-
posed right now—that would tie the 
hands of housing providers across this 
country and cause many of them to 
collapse, damaging the very industry 
and the very sector of our economy 
that we need to strengthen to deal with 
these critical issues. 
We still have time to reach a bipar-
tisan solution. I believe a bipartisan 
solution is possible to help out the 
renters across our country, and I have 
been working to develop one. This is 
likely something, if we can get agree-
ment to move on it, that provides tar-
geted support to renters who have suf-
fered COVID–19-related reduction in 
their income or job loss and who were 
current on their rent before the out-
break, avoids creating perverse incen-
tives in our housing market by ensur-
ing that those who are able to pay 
their rent continue to do so, and is lim-
ited to the length of the crisis and is 
delivered through a mechanism—con-
trary to what is being proposed here— 
delivered through a mechanism that is 
quick, responsible, and minimizes op-
portunities for fraud, waste, and abuse. 
We can do this if we will stop the 
‘‘my way or the highway’’ approach to 
the House legislation and work to-
gether in the Senate to do what we did 
with the CARES Act in the first place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6357 
October 21, 2020 
The argument has been made that we 
won’t even re-up the unemployment in-
surance, when the Senator from South 
Dakota made it very clear the bill that 
our colleagues rejected just hours ago 
on the floor of the Senate had a 100- 
percent wage replacement formula—100 
percent wage replacement. 
But the notion of trying to quickly 
advance the provision that we are talk-
ing about by unanimous consent, with-
out the opportunity to properly debate 
it, is a concerning precedent and will 
only cause more long-term damage in 
the future. 
Accordingly, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from Idaho, and I 
regret that he will not be my com-
mittee partner next year because he is 
moving on to—I guess he considers it a 
better committee. I don’t know for 
sure. 
But anyway, the Senator from Idaho 
is right. We passed it unanimously 
back in March, and it worked. The $600 
and the help for hospitals and schools 
and governments, local and State gov-
ernments, actually kept—1 study said 
12 million; say it is half of that—5, 6 
million people out of poverty. It 
worked. 
So we said to Senator MCCONNELL in 
about May or June—because these pro-
grams and dollars were running out— 
we see what has worked. We will jet-
tison what doesn’t work, and we will 
continue those programs. But then, lo 
and behold, Senator MCCONNELL kept 
saying: No sense of urgency, no sense 
of urgency, no sense of urgency, and we 
got zero in the end, when we asked 
Senator MCCONNELL
in August to— 
don’t let the $600 expire. We know more 
people will drop into poverty. We know 
more people will be evicted. We know, 
as Senator JACK REED has worked on, 
we will see more people foreclosed on. 
Senator MCCONNELL
has used the 
crutch of half the Republicans, half my 
friends on this side of the aisle, don’t 
want to vote another dollar. He said 
they won’t vote for anything. So 
maybe Senator CRAPO is an exception 
to that. 
But this proposal of MCCONNELL, we 
know how cynical it is; we know how 
inadequate it is; we know how pitiful it 
is; and we know that Speaker PELOSI 
has made several offers. She started 
with a pretty big package that a lot of 
us thought was pretty close to ideal. 
We knew that there would be com-
promise. She came back with a signifi-
cantly smaller package, and still they 
just say she rammed it through, and 
they rejected it. 
So I understand the handwriting on 
the wall that as long as Republicans 
control this body, that we won’t take 
care of people at home, that we won’t 
do adequate—adequate rental assist-
ance, and we won’t do adequate unem-
ployment. 
We will see a cynical, inadequate sort 
of pitiful attempt by the majority lead-
er to put something on the floor that 
really doesn’t meet people’s needs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I 
know we have yet another UC request 
coming, and I want to give time for 
that to my colleague here in the Sen-
ate. 
I, too, appreciate working with the 
Senator from Ohio, and we worked in a 
bipartisan fashion when we put the 
first CARES Act on the floor, which, as 
you said, got a unanimous vote. I am 
hopeful we can do that again. 
I just want to respond to one thing, 
and that is it is constantly being said 
that Senator MCCONNELL said there is 
not a sense of urgency. This was 
months and months and months ago 
before our first act had even had an op-
portunity to play out. 
But the urgency that you have seen 
from Senator MCCONNELL and others 
today is reflective of the refusal or the 
inability—let me say the inability of 
both sides to come together on a deal. 
And his reaching out multiple times— 
most recently a few hours ago today— 
and I am hopeful that we will reach out 
again and give all of our Senate col-
leagues the opportunity to simply pro-
ceed to get a bill on the floor that we 
can work on. 
I totally disagree with the argument 
that what we have been trying to get— 
a $500 billion bill—I can’t even remem-
ber the negative comments that were 
made at the time, the type of descrip-
tive comments that were made about 
it. It is a very real, significant piece of 
legislation that itself can be enhanced. 
It could be enhanced with this rental 
assistance that we are talking about 
right now. 
I believe we need to get some legisla-
tion on the floor, stop the back-and- 
forth bantering between parties and be-
tween Houses in the Congress, and get 
serious discussion of serious legislation 
and move forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3983 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
am here to talk about who runs Amer-
ica—the big tech giants or the Amer-
ican people? I am here to talk about 
the big tech oligarchs’ attempts to in-
stall themselves as the de facto ruling 
class of this country, to usurp the 
power of the people, and I am here to 
talk about what we can do about it. 
For years, the tech giants—Google, 
Facebook, Twitter—they have spied on 
us without our knowledge; they have 
taken our private information without 
our consent; and they have used all of 
it to manipulate us and turn massive 
profits in which the American people 
have had no share. That is their busi-
ness model. It is like the strip mining 
of America. 
But now, not content with exploiting 
and extracting, the tech monopolies 
want to control our news and opinions, 
and they want to intervene in a Presi-
dential election. 
For the better part of a week, the 
tech giants have been actively sup-
pressing the reporting of Alexander 
Hamilton’s newspaper, the New York 
Post. And why? Well, because they 
don’t like the story and they don’t 
want people to read it and they are 
willing to use their power to stop the 
distribution of a story written by the 
free press in this country. 
Now this isn’t about Hunter Biden’s 
emails, though those are important, 
and we deserve to know whether Hun-
ter Biden was giving his father kick-
backs 
on 
payments 
from 
foreign 
oligarchs in exchange for changes to 
American foreign policy. 
But this is about something even 
more than that. This is about whether 
a small handful of corporate execu-
tives—Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, 
Sergey Brin, and Larry Page—whether 
they get to decide who is allowed to see 
what; which newspapers are allowed to 
break the big stories and which ones 
are censored; which political party will 
get bad news suppressed at the height 
of the election season and which one 
will get it amplified. And most impor-
tant, it is about you. It is about what 
normal, everyday Americans get to see. 
It is about what you get to say. It is 
about the news you read in your news 
feeds and the content that comes to 
you in your notifications and your 
video playlist because, yes, the tech 
companies control all of those things, 
and they use them to try to shape what 
you are thinking—even how you are 
feeling. Oh, yes, they have run experi-
ments on all of that. They have run ex-
periments on how to manipulate the 
content that they control and deliver 
to you in order to manipulate your 
emotions and influence your views and 
influence how you feel and what mood 
you are in, and, yes, what Presidential 
candidate you favor. 
It is their roller coaster, and we are 
all just riding on it. That is their 
world. That is the world that they 
want. That is the America that they 
want. 
The struggle against the tech giants 
is a struggle for control. Do the tech 
platforms control America or do we 
control them? And it is time the U.S. 
Senate did something about it. This 
body is supposed to represent the peo-
ple of this Nation. This body is sup-
posed to defend the people’s interests, 
but for too long this body has done the 
bidding of Big Tech. It has given tech 
lavish government handouts and then 
looked the other way while tech cap-
tured one government agency after an-
other. 
Do you know a recent news report 
found that the FTC, the body in charge 
of enforcing—supposedly—much of our 
antitrust law and our competition law, 
that two-thirds of the FTC’s employees 
have conflicts of interest related to 
tech? That is good old-fashioned gov-
ernment capture by Big Business, by

October 21, 2020 
the megacorporations, and that is ex-
actly what has been going on in Wash-
ington for years right under the nose of 
the U.S. Senate. 
And if we are being honest, it is real-
ly no surprise. Tech has spent out-
rageous sums of money—outrageous 
sums of money—to purchase influence 
in the Capitol of the United States. It 
is time for those days to end. This body 
must act in defense of the American 
people, and we can. 
We can tear down the main pillars of 
Big Tech’s power. We don’t have to tol-
erate their monopolies. We don’t have 
to 
accept 
their 
stranglehold 
over 
speech and our data and our news and 
our personal information and our so-
cial communications. We can force 
them to change the way they do busi-
ness rather than allowing them to 
force us to change how we think. 
We can ban manipulative ads, and we 
should. We can repeal the immunity 
shield. We can crack down on addictive 
platform design. And I have introduced 
plenty of legislation over the last 22 
months to do all of that, and I am still 
waiting for a vote on almost all of it. 
Heck, I am still waiting for hearings on 
any of it. 
If this body is not ready or willing to 
say that these platforms need to 
change the essence of what they do, 
well, then let’s at least tell them that 
they cannot censor us with impunity. 
Let’s at least make them live up to 
their word when they tell us that they 
want open conversation. Let’s at least 
tell them that if they violate their 
promises to us and if they censor us ar-
bitrarily, that we can have our day in 
court to fight back. 
Let’s at least put some power back in 
the hands of the American people to 
fight the tech giants, and let’s allow 
Americans to have their day in court. 
And that is why I am moving this 
legislation here, now, today on this 
floor, to provide every American that 
right. We should get this done now. 
There should be no further delays. 
And let’s haul those tech executives 
in to testify under oath about what 
they did last week and at whose behest. 
Let’s get binding commitments from 
them, under penalty of perjury, about 
how they will do their work in the 
short remaining days of this election 
season and about the future of their 
censorship policies. Let’s get the truth 
out of them. 
I would just say to my fellow Repub-
licans, we are supposed to be the oppo-
nents of concentrated power. That is 
what the fight against Big Government 
has been about all along. So what have 
we been doing with our Senate major-
ity to fight the greatest concentration 
of power Americans face today? What 
have we been doing to confront this 
great threat to American democracy? 
Let’s just tell the truth. The truth is 
many Members of the Republican es-
tablishment love Big Tech. They love 
Big Tech. The think tanks love the 
money that Big Tech contributes to 
them. The lobbyists love the work that 
they provide. It is a gravy train. The 
politicians love the cheap ads that they 
get to run on Facebook. 
Now, Washington, DC, does really 
well under the current arrangement— 
really well. Big Tech works really well 
for Washington. Heck, Big Tech owns 
half the town. But if you are an every-
day American, if you are an inde-
pendent journalist, if you are a pro-life 
advocate, if you are somebody who 
doesn’t have the approval of Big Tech, 
if you are somebody who doesn’t have 
an inside track to the good graces of 
the tech giants, well, the message to 
you is really simple: Do what tech tells 
you to do or they will silence you. 
No corporation should run America, 
and definitely not Big Tech. We have 
squandered precious time already. The 
tech giants have been allowed to grow 
too powerful, too big. Now we must act 
while we still have time remaining and 
stand up and be counted before it is too 
late. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Commerce be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 3983 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I want to be 
clear about what is going on. I have 
worked very hard on tech issues and in-
troduced bipartisan legislation actu-
ally to reform section 230. We have had 
hearings in this area. Senator THUNE 
and I have been working in good faith 
in this space. 
So I want to separate out the kind of 
legitimate 
questions 
regarding 
the 
tech industry’s influence on American 
society, as it relates to privacy, which 
I have legislation for, as it relates to 
its impact on journalism, and as it re-
lates to whether or not there can be an 
appropriate balance struck in terms of 
preventing the platforms from being 
hijacked for the purpose of carrying 
foreign misinformation for the purpose 
of influencing an election and their le-
gitimate rights under statutory law 
and their free speech rights. 
These are complicated issues. Sen-
ator HAWLEY and I briefly had a con-
versation about these issues. I listened 
to him talk on these issues, and I basi-
cally said: Look, I divide what you are 
talking about into two categories. I 
think some of your critique around Big 
Tech is smart and I agree with, and 
some of it I consider to be not in good 
faith and an effort to influence the 
platforms in order to carry the water 
for people like Rudy Giuliani. 
So if there is a sincere effort to work 
on a bipartisan basis on something so 
foundational as section 230 or whether 
or not to establish a privacy right in 
statutory law, which has never hap-
pened at the Federal level, then, I am 
all in for that. But it is quite unusual 
for us to take on something so funda-
mental. 
The Senator is a Member of the ma-
jority. If the Senator could not get a 
hearing, that is absolutely his problem. 
I could get a hearing for my bill be-
cause I have bipartisan cosponsors. So, 
on all of the legislation that he is talk-
ing about, he has failed to reach across 
the aisle and to work with a Democrat 
or two or three and to try to reform 
some of these institutions through the 
levers of power that we are in posses-
sion of. 
And fast forward to next Wednesday, 
I think it is, and the Senate Commerce 
Committee, through its Twitter feed, is 
running a campaign ad—literally, a 
campaign 
ad—that 
says: 
Hunter 
Biden’s emails. This is the Commerce 
Committee of the U.S. Senate, and 
they are tweeting out things con-
cerning Hunter Biden’s emails. What a 
sad moment for the institution of the 
U.S. Senate and the cumulative bipar-
tisan history of the U.S. Senate Com-
mittee on Commerce. 
It is terribly sad. If there is an effort 
to work on these issues in good faith, I 
will be the first in line. I have been the 
first in line. But if we are going to try 
to do a unanimous consent—which 
means, for the public watching, that 
we are going to pass this bill unani-
mously without any debate; we are 
going to pass this bill without it going 
to a hearing; we are going to pass this 
bill without any Democratic input— 
that is nonsense. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
would agree that it is a problem that 
we can’t get hearings or votes on seri-
ous tech legislation. That is a problem. 
The Senator makes my point. That is 
exactly the problem, and that is ex-
actly what one gets from Big Tech’s 
significant investment in the U.S. Cap-
itol. They are getting exactly what 
they paid for. 
I would also say to my Democratic 
friends that you can’t separate Big 
Tech’s control of information and of 
the news and love it when they agree 
with you and condemn it when they 
don’t. 
I don’t want to influence the plat-
forms. I want to break them up. I don’t 
want to influence how they use their 
power. I don’t want them to have the 
power. I don’t want them to agree with 
me. I don’t want to influence or shape 
their views. I want them to stop trying 
to manipulate the American people. 
That should be the goal. 
The goal is not to compromise their 
power. The goal is not to say: Hey, how 
about Big Government and Big Tech 
get together? We have had too much of 
that already. The goal should be to put 
a stop to their power and control, be-
cause the American people are sup-
posed to be the sovereigns of this de-
mocracy, not Big Tech.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6359 
October 21, 2020 
I say again to my liberal friends and 
to those on the conservative side of the 
ledger, as well: If you are not willing to 
challenge tech’s control over news and 
over information and over communica-
tion and over messaging and over jour-
nalism, then, I don’t think you have 
yet reckoned with the truly dangerous 
threat that these companies pose to 
the functioning of American democ-
racy, and I don’t think you have yet 
reckoned with the threat we are facing 
to the basic control of ‘‘We the peo-
ple.’’ 
For my part, I will not stop. I will 
continue to come to this floor as often 
as necessary. I will continue to raise 
my voice and make a nuisance of my-
self as often and as firmly as necessary 
until this body acts and until the 
American people are given back con-
trol of their democracy, their informa-
tion, and their lives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I rise 
today to tell the people of Minnesota 
why I will oppose the confirmation of 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an As-
sociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Our Constitution’s most fundamental 
charge is to render equal justice under 
the law. This promise is so central to 
our justice system that those words are 
inscribed above the entrance to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. The late Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life 
to advancing the principle of equality 
under the law, and I believe all nomi-
nees to our Nation’s highest Court 
must share that dedication. 
Unfortunately, Judge Barrett does 
not meet that standard. Judge Barrett 
was nominated to fulfill President 
Trump’s promise to appoint Supreme 
Court Justices who would do two 
things which I believe are antithetical 
to equal justice under the law: disman-
tling the Affordable Care Act and over-
turning Roe v. Wade. 
So let’s be clear about what is hap-
pening. We know Judge Barrett was 
nominated because President Trump 
and Republicans believe that she will 
help them overturn the Affordable Care 
Act and take us back to the days when 
millions more Americans do not have 
health insurance and insurance compa-
nies can deny coverage or charge exor-
bitant rates to people with preexisting 
conditions, like cancer or heart dis-
ease. They could charge women more 
and seniors more, and they would be 
able to charge more to people with 
COVID as a preexisting condition. 
As we know, Judge Barrett was nomi-
nated because Donald Trump believes 
she will uphold laws that treat women 
as less capable of making independent 
decisions about their health, their per-
sonal beliefs, and birth control than 
State legislatures. 
A person who can pass these two Re-
publican litmus tests does not sound 
like someone to me who is committed 
to equal justice under the law. 
Now, many of my Democratic col-
leagues have talked about the terrible 
impact of striking down the Affordable 
Care Act on American families. I share 
this commitment that they have—that 
we all have—to protect healthcare as a 
human right. But as the only Senator 
who has worked at Planned Parent-
hood, I want to take my time today to 
talk about what is at stake if the Su-
preme Court overturns or weakens Roe. 
When I worked at Planned Parent-
hood, I saw firsthand how comprehen-
sive reproductive healthcare is essen-
tial for women to have the freedom and 
the opportunity to live the lives that 
they choose. I also saw how efforts to 
strip away these protections are an af-
front to the equal rights and dignity of 
women and their families. 
For all people, healthcare decisions 
are the most personal. It is your body 
and it is your life, and decisions about 
reproductive health and sexual health 
are even more personal and intensely 
private. There is still stigma and dis-
crimination 
around 
reproductive 
health, especially abortion, and that 
makes it even more important that 
people have privacy and space and ex-
cellent care without judgment, which 
is what Planned Parenthood provides. 
I became aware during my time at 
Planned 
Parenthood 
how 
personal 
these decisions are for women and how 
the political debate around abortion is 
disconnected from the facts and the re-
alities of women’s lives. 
Here is an example. The battle over 
restricting access to abortion has noth-
ing to do with the public health work 
to prevent unintended pregnancies and 
reduce the abortion rate. Indeed, the 
Guttmacher Institute has repeatedly 
found that restrictive State abortion 
laws are not causally associated with 
the decline in abortion rates. In fact, 
fewer 
unintended 
pregnancies 
and 
lower teen pregnancy rates are cor-
related not with restrictive abortion 
laws but with access to sexuality edu-
cation and birth control and also to a 
healthy economy. 
Here is another example. Most re-
strictive abortion laws seem to be 
aimed at a stereotype of an irrespon-
sible woman who hasn’t been careful 
and somehow got herself into a mess. 
First of all, this is a sexist and dis-
respectful trope. Research shows that 
women from all walks of life seek abor-
tion care. Over half are already moth-
ers. Over 80 percent report using con-
traception. And over half report a reli-
gious affiliation. These women all have 
their own unique circumstances and 
needs and beliefs. What they have in 
common is that they deserve the dig-
nity and respect to make their own 
judgments about what is best for them 
and their families in the course of their 
own lives. 
What I saw at Planned Parenthood 
were women, our patients, who were 
working really hard to make good deci-
sions about their own health, and they 
wanted to take charge of their health 
and their lives. But this is really dif-
ficult when you can’t afford basic 
healthcare, like birth control, if you 
don’t have good insurance or any insur-
ance. 
It is very hard if you have been 
shamed or threatened or harassed for 
seeking the care that you need. It is 
even harder when the government is 
looking over your shoulder, telling you 
what you can and cannot do with your 
body and your life, because the truth 
is, most laws restricting abortion are 
not about good healthcare. They are 
about substituting the judgment of 
government for the intensely personal, 
medical, and moral decisions that 
women, their doctors, and their fami-
lies want and need to make for them-
selves. 
The truth is, these laws treat women 
as fundamentally unequal in their deci-
sion-making capacity, and they are an 
insult to women’s individual dignity 
and freedom and body autonomy. 
I think this is why most Americans 
disagree with the Republicans’ rush to 
roll back Roe. This anti-choice agenda 
is radically out of step with the Amer-
ican people. In 2019, Pew Research, 
which is a respected nonpartisan poll-
ing organization, found that 61 percent 
of Americans say that abortion should 
be legal in all or most instances. Now, 
some of my Republican colleagues 
must know that they are out of step 
with the American people, which must 
be why some have suggested that it is 
‘‘fearmongering’’ 
to 
say 
that 
Roe 
might be overturned if Judge Barrett 
joins the Supreme Court. 
So, after promising over and over to 
confirm only anti-choice judges, judges 
who would overturn Roe, they now try 
to claim that we can’t possibly predict 
how Justice Barrett would vote on this 
issue. Well, this is completely illogical 
and completely unbelievable, and I 
think the American people know bet-
ter. 
Make no mistake, many conservative 
State legislatures have already passed 
laws specifically intended to create the 
opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
revisit and overturn Roe, and if Justice 
Barrett goes on the Court and becomes 
the definitive vote to overturn or 
weaken Roe, 22 States are poised to im-
mediately ban all or nearly all abor-
tions. There are 16 others that will im-
mediately enact severe restrictions to 
dramatically reduce access, and more 
States are sure to follow. 
If the Supreme Court overturns Roe, 
who is hurt most? Poor women, women 
living 
in 
rural 
communities, 
and 
women without the means to travel to 
places where women’s rights are re-
spected, and this is the definition of 
unequal justice. 
This Supreme Court nominee will 
have a momentous effect on the lives 
and personal decisions of Minnesotans 
and Americans. There is so much at 
stake. 
So I urge all Americans to make your 
voices heard and to hold your elected 
representatives accountable in Con-
gress, in the State house, and in local

but only if you use them. 
I will always stand up for all Ameri-

nomination. I urge my colleagues to

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The senior Senator from 
North Dakota. 
REMEMBERING MARK ANDREWS 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor former U.S. Senator 
from North Dakota, Mark Andrews, 
who passed away earlier this month at 
the age of 94. 
Mark was a good friend, a strong 
leader, and a dedicated public servant. 
It is appropriate that we take this time 
to remember his life and his accom-
plishments. 
He was a lifelong North Dakotan, 
only moving away for 2 years while at-
tending the U.S. Military Academy at 
West Point. After completing his edu-
cation at North Dakota State Univer-
sity—home of the Bison—Mark went to 
work and operated the family farm in 
the Red River Valley, as both his fa-
ther and his grandfather had before 
him. So it shows you how long his fam-
ily has been on that land, and it is 
truly—I know the Presiding Officer has 
been there—a beautiful farm. It is some 
of the best farmland, really, in the 
country, in the world, and in the Red 
River Valley. 
As a farmer, he raised a variety of 
crops. He operated a cattle feeding lot, 
and he contributed to various agricul-
tural organizations. He was very in-
volved with those organizations. 
In addition, he served as the director 
of the Garrison Conservancy District 
from 1955 to 1964. I remember that. My 
father and Mark Andrews were very 
good friends. My dad liked Mark very 
much and respected him very much. 
They shared that vision for the Garri-
son Conservancy project, the Garrison 
Diversion. They really had this vision 
of irrigating hundreds of thousands of 
acres, if not millions of acres of land in 
North Dakota. 
You know, my dad shared that dream 
Mark had that that would just benefit 
agriculture so much across North Da-
kota in a big, big way. It really was an 
amazing vision and would have been re-
markable had they been able to com-
plete it. Mark Andrews, for the rest of 
his life, was truly just committed to 
that project. He always shared that vi-
sion of Garrison Diversion. I agreed. 
From the time I was a young boy, I can 
remember my father describing it and 
describing Mark’s leadership and just 
what a wonderful thing it would be and 
would have been for the State of North 
Dakota. So I will always remember 
that very vividly, as I know the Pre-
siding Officer does as well. Mark An-
drews was also president of the North 
Dakota Crop Improvement and Seed 
Association as well. 
These life and work experiences 
served as the foundation, really, for his 
time in Congress, where he would rep-
resent North Dakota for nearly 24 
years—24 years of service in Congress— 
in the House and, of course, in this 
body. In 1963, he was elected to the U.S. 
House of Representatives during a spe-
cial election, and he served in the 
House until 1981. 
On January 3, 1981, he was sworn in 
as a U.S. Senator from North Dakota, 
serving until January 3, 1987. During 
his time in the Senate, Mark was a 
tireless advocate for men and women in 
uniform and understood the impor-
tance of a strong national defense. 
Again, the Presiding Officer and I fol-
low in that legacy, with the Presiding 
Officer on Armed Services and my serv-
ice on Defense Appropriations. Mark 
was always very, very committed to 
our military and did a great job sup-
porting not only the military in North 
Dakota but for our Nation as well. 
As a farmer himself, he will be re-
membered for his hard work on behalf 
of agriculture. You couldn’t talk to 
Mark without agriculture coming up in 
some way, shape, or form. Even if you 
weren’t talking about agriculture, the 
analogies that he used and his words 
and verbiage always had that agrarian 
aspect to them. It was imbued, really, 
in his personality. He always worked 
very hard on behalf of ag. His efforts to 
help 
producers 
through 
the 
tough 
times, the downturns, and the chal-
lenges that he had in farm country 
were very, very important. Of course, 
he understood it very well. He was a 
lifelong farmer. I mean, he knew it and 
he lived it, so he understood what he 
needed to do to help our great farmers 
and ranchers across this country. 
Senator Andrews’ legacy also in-
cluded strong support of Tribal com-
munities, and he served as the chair-
man of the Senate Committee on In-
dian Affairs. I am now very honored to 
hold that same position. 
Throughout his years of service, Sen-
ator Andrews demonstrated dedication 
to the people of North Dakota and an 
absolute commitment to do all he 
could for our State and, of course, for 
our Nation as well. We are deeply 
grateful for his work, and we remain 
deeply grateful for all the contribu-
tions that he made through his service 
for our State. 
At the same time, he was joined by 
his best friend and wife Mary in build-
ing this legacy. She, too, passed away 
earlier this year. So on behalf of myself 
and my wife Mikey, we extend our 
deepest condolences to the Andrews 
family, to all their loved ones, and to 
their friends. 
Along with the Presiding Officer, I 
am introducing a resolution recog-
nizing and honoring Senator Andrews’ 
public service, which we expect will 
soon pass the Senate. I know col-
leagues here remember Mark very, 
very fondly. As a matter of fact, when 
I was first sworn in, Mark came down 
and joined me and was there with me 
when I was originally sworn in as a 
Senator. 
I note that Senator CRAMER is pre-
siding, as I mentioned in my remarks, 
and I know how he knew and liked 
Mark and how much they worked to-
gether. The Presiding Officer had a lot 
of wonderful shared history with him. 
So, at this time, I will yield the floor 
and exchange positions with the Pre-
siding Officer so that he can speak on 
behalf of our friend and colleague Sen-
ator Mark Andrews. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from North Da-
kota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent, for the recognition, and thank 
you also for your excellent tribute to 
Senator Mark Andrews and his amaz-
ing life of service to North Dakota and 
to our country. Also, thank you for 
switching places with me for a few 
minutes so I can spend some time re-
membering my friend and mentor and 
our predecessor. 
This COVID thing really kind of 
stinks, all in all. There are lots of 
things about COVID–19 that are awful, 
but one of the biggest things is so 
often, many people have been robbed of 
the opportunity to provide an appro-
priate sendoff to a hero, to the heroes 
whose lives are worthy of a more noble 
celebration than what social distancing 
and small crowds offer. 
As former Grand Forks Herald editor, 
publisher, 
and 
sometimes 
political 
commentator and observer, Mike Ja-
cobs wrote in the Grand Forks Herald: 
‘‘Mark Andrews deserves better.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent to have the 
Jacobs story printed in the RECORD, 
along with the official obituaries of 
both Mark and Mary Andrews. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OBITUARY FOR MARY ANDREWS 
Mary Andrews was born February 10, 1927 
in Marshall, Missouri. She died peacefully on 
July 16, 2020 surrounded by family and 
friends, including her best friend and hus-
band of seventy-one years, Mark Andrews. 
Mary was the only child and the light of 
the lives of George and Lucille Willming. 
They moved to Fargo in 1940 when Mary was 
in seventh grade. The Willmings attended 
Gethsemane 
Cathedral 
on 
Ninth 
Street 
South and so did Mark Andrews’ family. 
Their friendship began there when the two 
(neither of great voice) were asked to fill 
chairs in the choir. 
Mary joined a wonderful potluck in high- 
school and gained lifelong friendships there. 
She went on to graduate with a degree from 
Smith College in political science. Mark 
often commented that his political success 
was all due to Mary. They were a great 
team—both loved serving the people of North 
Dakota. 
Mary was active in PEO, Homemakers, her 
church, The International Club, and she was 
president of Junior League and President of 
the Congressional Club. She was blessed with 
many wonderful friends. 
Mary married her best friend, Mark, on 
June 28, 1949. Mark and Mary were able to be 
together to celebrate their 71st wedding an-
niversary a little less than three weeks be-
fore Mary’s death.

and Aaron Locke and their children: Lucy 
and Staton; Matt and Poli Herman and their 
children: Henry and Caroline; Sam and Mia 
Herman and son: Gage; and Joe and Kristin

OBITUARY FOR MARK ANDREWS II 
Mark Andrews II was born May 19, 1926, in 
Fargo, North Dakota. He died on October 3, 
2020. He was 94. 
Mark II was the son of his namesake, Mark 
Andrews I, also known as the singing sheriff 
because he sang with the Metropolitan Opera 
in New York before returning to the family 
farm near Mapleton, North Dakota and 
meeting and marrying Mark II’s mother, Lil-
lian Hoyler, a Kindergarten teacher from Es-
canaba, Michigan. As a young boy, Mark II 
lived in the Sheriff’s house, a large brown-
stone behind the Cass County Courthouse in 
Fargo. 
Mark’s life abruptly changed when his fa-
ther was seriously injured during a high 
speed chase of boot leggers and then died. 
Young Mark was twelve when he and his 
mother and sister moved to the Siegel Apart-
ments in Fargo. Fortunately although they 
had very little, his mother always made her 
children feel secure. 
In 1939 Mark was in 8th grade at Agassiz 
Junior High when he met his best friend, 
Mary Willming. They married on June 29, 
1949, and celebrated their 71st wedding anni-
versary (81 years of friendship) less than 
three weeks before Mary’s death on July 16, 
2020. 
Mark served in the United States Army 
1944–1946 as a cadet at the United States 
Military Academy, West Point, New York, 
until receiving a disability discharge in 1946. 
He then returned to North Dakota and at-
tended NDSU where he was proud to be a 
Sigma Chi and graduated in 1949. He married 
his best friend and took over management of 
the family farm, eventually purchasing the 
land and operating a cattle feed lot. 
Mark served as a director of the Garrison 
Conservancy District 1955–1964 and was a 
member and past president of the North Da-
kota Crop Improvement Association. 
Mark’s degree from NDSU was in agricul-
tural science. Mary’s degree from Smith Col-
lege was in political science. Soon politics 
became an interest. Mark was a Republican 
National Committeeman 1958–1962. He was 
elected to the Eighty-Eighth United States 
Congress by special election October 22, 1963 
to fill the vacancy caused by the death of 
Representative Hjalmar Nygaard; he was re- 
elected to eight succeeding congresses serv-
ing North Dakota in the United States House 
of Representatives from October 22, 1963 
until January 3, 1981. He was elected to the 
United States Senate in November 1980 with 
70% of the vote and served North Dakota 
there from January 3, 1981 to January 3, 1987. 
Mark worked hard to serve his state in 
Congress and was remarkably adept at find-
ing and forming alliances to accomplish good 
and get problems solved. He frequently said, 
‘‘You know in those days people from both 
parties worked together and we got things 
done—Quentin Burdick was a good Democrat 
and I was a good Republican but we were 
good friends and we worked together for 
North Dakota. This not working together is 
foolishness!’’ 
Following his political career Mark and 
Jacqueline Balk-Tusa established a success-
ful consulting firm based in Washington, DC; 
he served as a director of Tenneco, Inc. and 
as a director of Nodak Mutual Insurance. 
Mark was blessed with a long and wonder-
ful life. He was so large at 6′4″ and full of sto-
ries and love for his family, his farm and his 
state that it is hard to believe he can be 
gone. Our sadness is tempered by our knowl-
edge that he is once again with his best 
friend of eighty-one years and at peace. 
Those blessed to mourn Mark are his sis-
ter, Barbara Bertel; his children, Mark III 
(Sue), Sarah (Doug Herman) and Karen; 
grand and great-grandchildren: Mark An-
drews IV, Katie and Aaron Locke and their 
children, Lucy and Staton; Matt and Poli 
Herman and their children, Henry and Caro-
line; Sam and Mia Herman and son, Gage and 
Joe and Kristin Herman. 
Mark and his family were blessed by his 
excellent caregivers, especially Missy Wil-
liams, Elaina McDonald and Allison Brocht.

MIKE JACOBS: SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI 
(Written by Mike Jacobs) 
Mark Andrews deserved better. He was a 
prominent and sometimes commanding fig-
ure in North Dakota politics for a quarter of 
a century, the victor in a titanic struggle for 
control of the Republican Party in the 
state—the dominant party then as now. In 
the end, he was an independent voice, as crit-
ical of Republicans when they deserved it as 
he was of Democrats when he campaigned 
against them. All told, he served for 17 years 
in the U.S. House of Representatives and six 
in the U.S. Senate. He lost the Senate seat in 
a close election in 1986. 
Andrews died Saturday, Oct. 3. He was 94 
years old. His death wasn’t reported until 
the following Tuesday, Oct. 6, and then ap-
parently because a funeral home routinely 
submitted an obituary. 
Andrews deserved a bigger sendoff. Thirty- 
four years away from the limelight don’t di-
minish his impact or his importance. 
At just 36 years old, Andrews was a prodigy 
with a pedigree when he first came to promi-
nence as the Republican candidate for gov-
ernor in 1962. Like many of the state’s gov-
ernors, he had deep roots in the Red River 
Valley. 
His 
family 
had 
farmed 
near 
Mapleton, just west of Fargo, for two genera-
tions, and his father had been sheriff of Cass 
County, then as now the state’s most popu-
lous and most powerful. 
Andrews lost that first election to William 
Guy, who was a bit older, though still youth-
ful, and who ran as the candidate of the 
emergent Democratic-NPL Party. For new-
comers and neophytes, those last three let-
ters stand for Nonpartisan League, an insur-
gent movement that brought North Dakota a 
state-owned bank and mill and elevator. The 
NPL historically filed its candidates mostly 
in the Republican column; the switch to the 
Democrats occurred in 1956. This was a trem-
or in the seismic change that swept over the 
state. Having dominated the state’s politics 
for half a century, William Langer, known as 
‘‘Wild Bill,’’ died in 1959. He’d been succes-
sively—though not without interruption—at-
torney general, governor and U.S. senator. 
The special election for a successor sent a 
Democrat to the U.S. Senate, Quentin Bur-
dick. 
The great opportunity for young Andrews 
came in 1963, when U.S. Rep. Hjalmar 
Nygaard died of a heart attack in the capitol 
building. North Dakota was divided into 
East and West congressional districts then, 
and the contest for the Republican endorse-
ment for the East District seat was spirited, 
pitting the youthful Andrews against a coali-
tion of conservatives led by John W. Scott of 
Gilby, a founder of the John Birch Society. 
Andrews, the liberal, won. 
Of course, the more conservative Repub-
licans haven’t given up. The state’s politics 
today are animated by the same sort of con-
flict within the Republican Party, though 
without the hysterical anti-communism of 
the Sixties. 
Andrews won the election and immediately 
built a reputation as an independent thinker. 
A Republican to be sure, Andrews didn’t 
hesitate to take on the party establishment, 
and even the president. He indicated that 
he’d vote to impeach Richard Nixon, for ex-
ample, and he frequently challenged Ronald 
Reagan’s economic and agricultural policies, 
a posture that drew national attention not 
to Andrews alone but to North Dakota’s 
once-vaunted exceptionalism in national pol-
itics—a heritage that Andrews understood 
and appreciated. 
As congressman and senator, Andrews 
proved adept at promoting the state’s inter-
ests, notably championing the kind of farm 
programs that Reagan’s market orientation 
rejected. He’s probably best remembered for 
his work to promote the Garrison Diversion 
project, which would have moved water from 
the Missouri River to central and eastern 
North Dakota. 
This issue dominated the state’s politics 
from the mid-Sixties when Andrews arrived 
in Washington. Unlike other state politi-
cians, Andrews sensed that the project 
wouldn’t survive scrutiny, and he worked to 
salvage what he could of the plan. His efforts 
met hostility from water development inter-
ests in the state, who came to regard An-
drews as a kind of traitor. 
They might have provided enough votes to 
defeat him when he sought re-election to the 
U.S. Senate in 1986. That’s impossible to 
know for sure, of course; there were other 
issues of significance in that election, as 
Richard Fenno’s book, ‘‘When Incumbency 
Fails,’’ illustrates in some detail. 
Apart from politics, Andrews had personal 
appeal. Perhaps the best illustration is his 
marriage. He’d known his wife, Mary An-
drews, most of his life, and she became an in-
tegral part of his campaigns. Andrews 
bought time on Election Eve each year for 
what became known as ‘‘The Mark and Mary 
Show,’’ where the two of them talked about 
matters pending. Mary Andrews appeared on 
their last show, on Election Eve 1986, when 
she was seriously ill. Her illness and its 
treatment had become an issue in the cam-
paign. 
Mary Andrews died in July 2020, just 
months before her husband’s passing. 
Mark Andrews’ own life can be parsed 
neatly: roughly 36 years before his promi-
nence in the state’s politics, 23 years as a 
prominent player, and another 36 years, al-
most, out of the spotlight—so much so that 
his passing went unnoticed for 72 hours. 
Sic transit gloria mundi. So goes worldly 
glory. 
For clarity’s sake: The State Board of 
Higher Education has eight voting members, 
seven citizens appointed by the governor who 
serve four years, and one student who serves 
but one year. Faculty and staff each have 
non-voting representatives to the board. 
Measure 1 on the November ballot would 
double the number of citizen members. 
Mr. CRAMER. We are confined to 
watching funerals on the internet, 
leaving us with a sense that our expres-
sions of gratitude and emotions are in-
adequate to the honor that is deserved. 
But fortunately for the Presiding Offi-
cer and me, the U.S. Senate does pro-
vide an opportunity, a venue, and an 
appropriate way to say goodbye to a 
friend and a mentor that is commensu-
rate with the incredible quality of the 
life that we celebrate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6362 
October 21, 2020 
Senator Andrews was a giant to me 
for lots of reasons, not just because he 
was 6 feet 4 inches. But from growing 
up in Kindred, just about 20 miles 
south of the Andrews farm just outside 
of the city village of Mapleton at the 
time, to working on his reelection cam-
paign—the first real job I ever had out 
of college—to seeking his guidance as I 
followed in his footsteps, first in the 
House of Representatives and then to 
the Senate, Mark Andrews was always 
a larger-than-life figure and person-
ality to me. 
Kris and I were grateful for the coun-
sel he and Mary gave us my first year 
in this Chamber just last year. I am 
really grateful to Mark and Mary’s 
daughter, Sarah, for facilitating a visit 
for Kris and me to come see her par-
ents just last year. This picture will be 
important to me forever. It was an 
emotional time for me. I don’t mind 
telling you that it was emotional for 
me to be able to go see Mark at the age 
of 93 and Mary at the age of 92 and say 
thank you for the opportunities and for 
the grace he afforded me when I didn’t 
deserve it. 
I mean no disrespect to any of my 
colleagues today, but what made me 
the most emotional when I walked into 
Mark’s apartment and saw him sitting 
in that recliner was that it hit me for 
the first time in a new way that the 
people of North Dakota had given me a 
responsibility that, at that time, as I 
looked at my giant, I didn’t feel quite 
up to. There it was, with this job that 
he had and this giant from my youth 
who did big things, I suddenly felt, by 
comparison, quite small. But, as Mark 
often did, he encouraged me. He offered 
a word of encouragement—many of 
them. Likewise, Mary did the same. At 
the age of 92, she offered Kris encour-
agement that only another Senate 
spouse really had the credibility to 
offer. 
I was overwhelmed by the blessing of 
the moment. I was grateful beyond 
words for the opportunity to spend 
even 90 minutes with Fargo’s most im-
portant power couple. It was pretty 
cool. 
Mark and Mary celebrated their 71st 
wedding anniversary just prior to her 
death earlier this year, as the Pre-
siding Officer mentioned. They met 
while attending Agassiz Junior High in 
Fargo in 1939; then they became best 
friends for life. It is pretty cool. Pretty 
cool. I love that Mary Andrews was her 
husband’s not-so-secret weapon in all 
of his successful campaigns. 
As the Presiding Officer said, Mark 
served a total of 23 years in Congress— 
17 in the House of Representatives and 
6 here in the Senate. His hallmark was 
his fierce independence. Now, that 
fierce independence sometimes was to 
the chagrin of the Reagan administra-
tion. He served during a very, very dif-
ficult time in farm country, but he 
fought tirelessly with the government 
on behalf of the people. He always put 
the people ahead of the government. 
As the Presiding Officer mentioned, 
anyone who spent any time with 
Mark—and he and I did a lot in the last 
several years—knows that no computer 
hard drive in the world contains as 
much 
knowledge 
and 
information 
about water policy as Mark Andrews 
had in his brain, even to the end. Of the 
90 minutes we talked last year, I am 
sure 60 of them were spent talking 
about water policy and water politics. 
He was passionate about the accom-
plishments, as the Presiding Officer 
said, and the shortcomings of the gov-
ernment’s promise to distribute Mis-
souri River water to the farms and 
communities of Eastern North Dakota. 
He fought and advocated for water jus-
tice for our farmers, and I think of him 
often as we engage in the very same 
fights today. He was also a strong, 
strong critic of government waste. 
You are right that he supported our 
military fiercely. There was a famous 
story about when he opposed the sale 
of AWACS to Saudi Arabia on behalf of 
our ally Israel, and it took a lot of, 
shall we say, gentle persuasion to con-
vince him otherwise. 
He always looked out for the tax-
payer. He cared more about the tax-
payer than the tax spender. He dem-
onstrated his commitment to fiscal re-
straint when he took on the Depart-
ment of Defense in 1983, sponsoring a 
bill requiring defense contractors to 
guarantee their hardware. The bill 
passed and became law. He was also 
critical of what he called the ‘‘inces-
tuous relationship’’ between the offi-
cers who made the weapons purchase 
decisions and the contractors who em-
ployed the officers after they retired. 
But, as the Presiding Officer pointed 
out in his remarks, Mark Andrews was 
first and foremost a farmer. Don’t take 
our word for it. It is not just a couple 
of hayseeds from North Dakota who 
will make that claim. No, just look at 
the headlines surrounding his recent 
death. 
The New York Times, in an obituary 
written by Robert McFadden, carries 
the headline ‘‘Mark Andrews, North 
Dakota Farmer-Politician, Dies at 94.’’ 
Did you catch that? Farmer first, the 
dash of life, and politician last. 
McFadden writes this in his story: 
As his 23-year congressional career drew to 
a close, The New York Times said Mr. An-
drews kept ‘‘three items at the top of his pri-
ority list:’’— 
A lot like you, I might say to the 
Presiding Officer— 
‘‘farmers, farmers and farmers.’’ 
The headline for a story written by 
Mikkel Pates in Agweek—a friend of 
ours, a reporter; actually, an agricul-
tural reporter—he described Senator 
Andrews’ legacy: ‘‘Andrews was a polit-
ical ‘laser beam’ for farm interests.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
both the Agweek and the New York 
Times stories printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Oct. 7, 2020] 
MARK ANDREWS, NORTH DAKOTA FARMER- 
POLITICIAN, DIES AT 94 
(By Robert D. McFadden) 
Mark Andrews, a North Dakota Republican 
farmer whose strident support for farmers 
helped him win nine elections to the House 
of Representatives and one to the Senate, 
but who could not stave off defeat for a sec-
ond Senate term in 1986, died on Saturday in 
Fargo, N.D. He was 94. 
The Hanson Runsvold Funeral Home in 
Fargo confirmed the death on its website. 
As his 23-year congressional career drew to 
a close, The New York Times said Mr. An-
drews had kept ‘‘three items at the top of his 
priority list: farmers, farmers and farmers.’’ 
Tall (6 foot 4), plain-spoken and rawboned, 
Mr. Andrews raised wheat, sugar beets and 
corn for 13 years before venturing into public 
life. He was the third generation in his fam-
ily to work a 1,280-acre Red River Valley 
spread that had been started by his grand-
father, Albion Andrews, in the Dakota Terri-
tory of 1881, eight years before North Dakota 
became a state. 
His father, also named Mark Andrews, was 
born on the farm in 1886 and became an 
opera-singing farmer-politician who gave 
concerts in Fargo and in New York and sang 
for the voters in his successful 1928 campaign 
for Cass County sheriff. He served one four- 
year term, went back to farming and died 
after being injured in a car accident. 
‘‘They called him the singing sheriff,’’ Mr. 
Andrews recalled in an interview for this 
obituary in 2018. ‘‘People used to say to me, 
‘Well, you’re the son of the singing sheriff,’ 
and ask me to sing. But I couldn’t carry a 
tune in a bushel basket.’’ 
With an easygoing warmth that appealed 
to rural voters, he began his political career 
in 1963 by winning a special election after 
the state’s lone member of the House of Rep-
resentatives died in office. In 17 years in the 
House, Mr. Andrews was a fiscal conserv-
ative, favoring spending cuts and balanced 
budgets, and a faithful backer of agricultural 
subsidies and farm price supports. His re- 
election became routine. 
But there was another side to Mr. Andrews, 
and it said much about his constituents’ tol-
erance. He had a moderate-to-liberal voting 
record on social issues, supporting food 
stamps and assistance to the poor and oppos-
ing bans on abortion and prayers in public 
schools. He once endorsed Nelson A. Rocke-
feller, New York’s liberal Republican gov-
ernor, for president. 
In a gentler era when politics was less of a 
blood sport, he liked Ike and L.B.J.—Presi-
dents Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, 
and Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat. And he 
befriended liberal Democrats like Senator 
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and 
Representative Bob Bergland of Minnesota, 
who later became President Jimmy Carter’s 
secretary of agriculture. 
‘‘Sure, he was a Democrat, and I was a Re-
publican,’’ Mr. Andrews told Inforum.com, 
The Fargo Forum news website, in 2017, re-
ferring to Mr. Bergland. ‘‘He would come to 
North Dakota and talk about his good friend 
Mark Andrews, and I’d go to Minnesota and 
talk about my good friend Bob Bergland, be-
cause we really were good friends despite our 
political differences.’’ 
The voters did not mind. In 1980, when 
North Dakota’s long-serving Republican sen-
ator, Milton Young, retired, Mr. Andrews 
jumped into the race and won the seat with 
70 percent of the votes, part of a swing to Re-
publican control of the Senate for the first 
time in decades. He began making national 
headlines. 
In 1981, as debate swirled over the Reagan 
administration’s proposed sale of Awacs

(Airborne Warning and Control System) 
planes to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Andrews joined 
liberal Democrats in opposing the sale as a 
peril to Israel. But after meeting with a per-
suasive President Ronald Reagan, he and 
four other senators switched sides, providing 
the margin to approve the arms sale, the big-
gest in the nation’s history. 
Senator Andrews took on the Defense De-
partment in 1983 by sponsoring what became 
a law—backed by a bipartisan coalition in 
Congress—that required makers of military 
weapons to guarantee their hardware. He 
criticized 
‘‘incestuous 
relationships’’ 
be-
tween military officers who bought weapons 
and defense contractors who often hired the 
officers in retirement. 
And in 1985, as a crisis loomed over the 
farm economy, he took on the Reagan White 
House, writing a bill to stabilize farm in-
comes by subsidizing commodity prices at 
steady levels over several years. 
Reagan opposed the measure as a budget- 
buster, arguing that subsidies encouraged 
surplus production and depressed markets. 
But he signed the measure anyway, hoping 
that rising commodity exports might even-
tually wean farmers from costly price sup-
ports. 
As Senator Andrews ran for re-election in 
1986, Republican anxiety ran high across the 
Farm Belt, where a devastating combination 
of falling land values, slumping market 
prices, high interest rates and dwindling ex-
ports had driven thousands of once-pros-
perous farm families off their land and in-
flicted economic pain on small towns. 
Trying to preserve Republican control of 
the Senate, Reagan campaigned in North Da-
kota three times for Mr. Andrews. But the 
dismal farm economy counted for more than 
the president’s charisma. On Election Day, 
Mr. Andrews lost by 3,785 votes, out of 182,600 
cast, to the Democrat Kent Conrad, the state 
tax commissioner. South Dakota’s Repub-
lican Senator, James Abdnor, also lost. (Mr. 
Conrad would have a long career in the Sen-
ate, retiring in 2013.) 
‘‘The farmers were saying they were not 
happy with the president’s farm policies,’’ 
Mr. 
Andrews’ 
campaign 
manager, 
Bill 
Sorenson, said in a day-after analysis. ‘‘Yet 
they were saying this president is a great fel-
low, and they took their resentment of his 
policies out on senators.’’ 
Mark Andrews II was born in Fargo on May 
19, 1926, to Mark and Lillian (Hoyler) An-
drews, a former kindergarten teacher from 
Michigan. He graduated from Fargo Central 
High School in 1943. After a year at North 
Dakota Agricultural College (now North Da-
kota State University), he attended the 
United States Military Academy at West 
Point for two years, leaving on a disability 
discharge, his family said, then returned to 
North Dakota Agricultural and graduated in 
1949. 
In 1949, he married Mary Willming, whom 
he had known since eighth grade. She died in 
July. He is survived by a son, Mark III; and 
two daughters, Sarah Herman and Karen An-
drews; and a sister, Barbara Bertel; as well 
as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
After his political career, Mr. Andrews be-
came a Washington lobbyist and consultant. 
In 1995, he retired to his farm, in Mapleton, 
N.D., which had grown to 3,000 acres. In re-
cent years he had resided at Bethany Retire-
ment Living at Grace Pointe in Fargo. 
Mr. Andrews called 1980 the high point of 
his political life. ‘‘It was the year I was 
elected to the Senate,’’ he said in the Times 
interview ‘‘and in North Dakota I outpolled 
the head of the Republican ticket, Ronald 
Reagan.’’ 
[From AGWEEK, Oct. 15, 2020] 
ANDREWS WAS A POLITICAL ‘LASER BEAM’ FOR 
FARM INTERESTS 
(By Mikkel Pates) 
MAPLETON, N.D.—Former U.S. Sen. Mark 
Andrews, R–N.D., who died at age 94 on Oct 
3, 2020, had an outsized impact and intimate 
knowledge of the region’s agricultural indus-
try—both in Washington, D.C., and back 
home. 
His agricultural roots ran deeper than the 
state itself. 
Officially, he was Mark Andrews II. His 
grandparents were from New York state and 
were Michigan-trained medical doctors who 
moved to Dakota Territory in the late 1870s, 
prior to statehood in 1889. The Andrewses 
bought some farmland near Mapleton, N.D., 
and established a farm. 
Later, Andrews’ father, Mark I, and uncle 
Arlo farmed it in a partnership. Mark I was 
trained as an opera singer and sang in the 
Metropolitan Opera in New York. He was 
dubbed the ‘‘singing sheriff’ and died from 
injuries in an auto chase with a perpetrator. 
Mark II was 12. 
FARMING, POLITICS 
Mark II grew up in Fargo and was active in 
Boy Scouts and Republican politics, said his 
daughter, Sarah Andrews Herman. He start-
ed West Point, but resigned because of a 
back injury, and took up agriculture at what 
is now North Dakota State University. In 
1948 he married his wife, Mary, a political 
science graduate of Smith College in Massa-
chusetts, 
where 
Nancy 
Reagan, 
Gloria 
Steinem and Barbara Pierce Bush had grad-
uated. 
The Andrewses moved on the farm in 1949. 
With Mary at his side, in 1960 he ran unsuc-
cessfully for governor against Bill Guy, an 
Amenia farmer and agricultural economist. 
It was the first year John F. Kennedy was 
elected president and the first year of the 
Democratic-Nonpartisan League party in 
North Dakota. 
Standing 6-foot-4, Mark II went on to win 
a House seat in a special election in 1963. He 
became a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, and served as the chairman of 
the 
agricultural 
subcommittee, 
working 
with two North Dakota U.S. senators—Milt 
Young, a Republican, and Quentin Burdick, a 
Democrat. 
Bob Christman, a former agricultural aide 
to Young (often dubbed ‘‘Mr. Wheat’’) re-
called that Andrews was always a ‘‘spokes-
man for, fought for agriculture.’’ Andrews 
was known for cross-party alliances, includ-
ing with Burdick. 
In 1980 Andrews won the Senate seat with 
70% of the vote. Mary Ann Bond of Fargo, an 
aide to Andrews from 1964 to 1983 in the 
House and Senate, said Andrews was an ad-
vocate of sugar policies, but worked on other 
projects, including with then-University of 
North Dakota President Tom Clifford in es-
tablishing UND as an aviation education 
leader, which later paved the way for the 
state’s leadership in drone technology. 
‘‘Agriculture is what we worked on every 
day,’’ Bond said. ‘‘It was the one area he 
wasn’t willing to compromise on.’’ 
‘A LASER BEAM’ 
Clare Carlson, today’s state director of the 
USDA’s Rural Development agency in the 
Trump administration, worked for Andrews 
as an ag aide in the Senate as he contributed 
to the 1985 farm bill, at the height of the 
farm credit crisis. 
‘‘He was the master of staying on the out-
side of a deal until he was needed,’’ Carlson 
recalled. 
Carlson said the 1985 bill offered benefits to 
the farm economy—including the Conserva-
tion Reserve Program land-idling program 
and strong increases in allocations to the 
Farmers Home Administration loan alloca-
tions. The help didn’t come quickly enough 
for some farmers. 
Randy Russell, principal in the The Russell 
Group Inc., one of today’s top Washington, 
D.C., lobbying firms, was chief of staff to 
then-Secretary of Agriculture John Block 
for the 1985 farm bill, and was a deputy as-
sistant USDA secretary of economics. Rus-
sell noted that agriculture faces its chal-
lenges today, but not like the 1980s when 
asset values declined by 25%. People simply 
couldn’t repay loans. 
‘‘He was a force to be reckoned with. He 
was tough,’’ Russell recalled, of Andrews. 
‘‘He was a fierce advocate for rural develop-
ment and sugar. He focused like a laser beam 
on things that he wanted.’’ 
Andrews lost his seat in 1986 in a close 
election with Sen. Kent Conrad, D–N.D., de-
spite bringing in President Ronald Reagan 
and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R– 
Kan. Pundits speculated some voters were 
looking for different leadership. Others said 
Andrews hurt himself politically when his 
family sued St. Luke’s Hospital in Fargo, for 
$10 million, alleging medical malpractice in 
Mary’s meningitis case. The Andrews family 
won the suit in June 1984 but received no fi-
nancial damages. 
After his children were grown, the Mark 
and Mary Andrews lived in the famed Water-
gate Hotel in Washington, D.C., but his heart 
was on the farm, where the Hermans now 
live, retired from legal careers. 
PROGRESSIVE FARMERS 
The Andrews family were progressive farm-
ers. In the past, they’d fed cattle and raised 
sugar beets before and after American Crys-
tal Sugar Co. became a cooperative. They 
built a grain elevator and were growers of 
certified seeds. In the later years, their crops 
were primarily com, soybeans and wheat. 
For many years, the senator’s son, Mark 
III, ran the operation until the land was 
rented out about five years ago. At its apex, 
the farm grew to 5,000 acres, including 3,000 
owned acres. They raised com, soybeans and 
wheat. 
As the worldwide farm crisis deepened in 
1986, Steiger went into Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy reorganization and emerged by sell-
ing to J.I. Case, which since the 1970s had 
owned half of J.I. Case. (In 1984 Case had ac-
quired International Harvester assets, even-
tually marketed as Case-IH.) 
Mark III said his father had used John 
Deere equipment, but also liked Steiger trac-
tors, developed in the Red River Valley and 
manufactured in Fargo—high horsepower, 
four-wheel-drives with an oscillating, articu-
lated design. Sometimes company engineers 
would test their prototypes on his farm— 
only about 15 miles from the factory. 
In the 1990s, Mark III surprised his dad 
when he bought a Case-IH tractor and set of 
grain drills from Jim Williams, who ran Ar-
thur (N.D.) Mercantile, the oldest one-family 
farm equipment company in the state. He re-
members his father—flying in from Wash-
ington—wondering ‘‘what the hell I’d done.’’ 
But, in fact, the Andrewses had purchased 
Case equipment from the Williams family in 
earlier decades, so they shifted almost en-
tirely to Case-IH. (Arthur Mercantile merged 
into Titan Machinery of Fargo in 2009 and 
Williams went on the board of Titan, the 
largest string of Case-IH stores in the coun-
try.) 
Out of the Senate in January 1987, Andrews 
started a political consulting company in 
Washington. 
He 
connected 
with 
Jim 
Ketelson, Tenneco’s CEO, who invited him to 
run for the parent company’s board of direc-
tors. 
Tenneco’s sold its ag interests to Fiat in 
1999, which later merged the company with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6364 
October 21, 2020 
New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Glob-
al. Andrews stayed on at Tenneco until 2001. 
Howard Dahl, chief executive of Amity 
Technology in Fargo, whose father, Gene, 
had been chairman of the board at Steiger 
Tractor, said Andrews had a ‘‘positive role, 
after the Tenneco acquisition, for keeping 
Steiger jobs in Fargo.’’ The company would 
go on to add construction wheel-loaders to 
its Fargo production line, adding to its sta-
bility. 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Case- 
IH developed a ‘‘Quadtrac’’ tractor with four 
tracks to replace four wheels. Mark III said 
his father was a big fan of four tracks offer-
ing particular turning capabilities and trac-
tion in Red River Valley heavy soils that had 
turned wetter after 1993. 
Titan CEO David Meyer said Andrews was 
a ‘‘gentleman’’ and big proponent of the 
Quadtrac. The Quadtrac went into produc-
tion as a 360 horsepower tractor in 1996. 
Today there are eight models from 370 to 628 
horsepower, including the 470, featured on a 
pedestal at the company’s factory in Fargo. 
Mr. CRAMER. ‘‘Farmer,’’ ‘‘fiercely 
independent,’’ ‘‘fiscal hawk’’—all of the 
good things the Presiding Officer said 
about him—they describe a part of Sen-
ator Mark Andrews, but to me, he is 
still a giant. 
At his funeral, the Gospel text that 
was read was from an agrarian parable 
in Matthew 13—a very familiar one to 
most people—where Jesus talks about 
the teeny mustard seed. In verse 32, He 
is recorded as saying: ‘‘Though it is the 
smallest of all seeds, yet when it 
grows, it is the largest of garden plants 
and becomes a tree so that birds can 
come and perch in its branches.’’ 
Mark Andrews was a really big tree 
with really big roots into the soil of 
the Red River Valley of North Dakota. 
I felt as though I had found a perch on 
his branches and stand on his shoul-
ders. 
Mark and Mary also died with the 
Gospel promise that Christ has pre-
pared a mansion for them in Heaven. I 
am pretty sure it is a farmhouse. 
Thank you, Senator Andrews. You 
served North Dakota well and will be 
missed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
come together to resume negotiations 
on a comprehensive relief package for 
Granite Staters and Americans across 
this country. 
Six million Americans have missed 
their rent or mortgage payments since 
September. The lines at food pantries 
in my State of New Hampshire and 
across the country are growing longer 
and longer. Yet the partisan Supreme 
Court nomination seems to be the only 
priority of the Republican leadership 
here in the Senate. 
The American public are tired of par-
tisan posturing. They need relief, and 
they need it now. That is why Congress 
should pass a bipartisan, comprehen-
sive package that addresses the chal-
lenges we are facing in the short and 
long term. 
Congress needs to provide assistance 
for our hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders, especially nursing homes and 
long-term care facilities, which ac-
count for 81 percent of COVID–19 
deaths in New Hampshire. That is the 
highest percentage in the country. 
We should also provide additional 
support 
for 
childcare 
centers 
and 
schools that are working to safely re-
open and operate during the fall term, 
and we shouldn’t condition those edu-
cation dollars on whether a school is 
physically open, as Republicans have 
repeatedly 
proposed. 
That 
decision 
should be made by State and local offi-
cials, and it should be based on safety. 
We also need to support our local 
communities so they can continue to 
pay our first responders, firefighters, 
police, and teachers. Under no cir-
cumstances should our communities 
have to cut essential services and 
frontline workers. 
After months of inaction, Leader 
MCCONNELL has forced the Senate to 
vote twice on a partisan package that 
was written in his office without any 
bipartisan input. Not surprisingly, that 
package doesn’t even come close to ad-
dressing the public health and eco-
nomic issues that our country is fac-
ing. We need to provide more financial 
support to hospitals, long-term care fa-
cilities, and other healthcare providers 
that are struggling on the frontlines of 
our fight against this pandemic. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s skinny bill 
does not provide any money for grants 
to healthcare providers. That is zero 
dollars for our Nation’s hospitals, even 
though hospitals like the Lakes Region 
General Hospital in New Hampshire 
just filed bankruptcy this week and 
hospitals across New Hampshire are 
projecting hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in losses this year due to the 
cancelation of elective procedures and 
nonemergency visits to deal with the 
pandemic. 
It also provides zero dollars for nurs-
ing homes and long-term care facilities 
at a time when nursing facility resi-
dents account for 81 percent of our 
COVID–19 deaths, and nursing homes, 
while they have seen 40 percent of the 
fatalities from this pandemic nation-
wide, have gotten only 4 percent of the 
funding. 
The bill provides zero dollars for 
community health centers across the 
country—community 
health 
centers 
that are providing care to millions of 
individuals, newly uninsured because 
they have lost their jobs due to the 
pandemic. 
The most recent version of the He-
roes Act that passed in the House ear-
lier this month would provide $50 bil-
lion in new grants for healthcare pro-
viders, as well as $7.6 billion to support 
our community health centers. 
I have joined Senator CASEY in press-
ing for additional dedicated funds, spe-
cifically for long-term care facilities, 
to help them retain and hire staff—one 
of the biggest challenges they are hav-
ing right now—acquire testing mate-
rials and PPE, and take other steps to 
ensure that our Nation’s seniors are 
kept safe. 
We also need much more funding to 
support testing. The Heroes Act pro-
vided $75 billion for a national testing 
and 
contact 
tracing 
plan. 
Leader 
MCCONNELL’s bill would only provide a 
fraction of that amount. 
It is pretty simple. We are not going 
to get ahead of this pandemic and help 
our economy recover if we fail to make 
investments in testing and contact 
tracing and if we leave our healthcare 
providers in a financial hole. These in-
vestments are key to getting life back 
to some semblance of normal. 
We also need to provide more funding 
to support our ongoing fight against 
the opioid epidemic. In New Hamp-
shire, we have seen that epidemic exac-
erbated by the pandemic, and we are 
beginning to see overdoses go up again. 
The McConnell skinny bill provides 
no financial help for families strug-
gling to pay the bills and put food on 
the table and no funding for State and 
local governments that are facing mas-
sive revenue shortfalls due to COVID– 
19. 
The State of New Hampshire is facing 
a budget shortfall of nearly $540 mil-
lion, about 20 percent of our State rev-
enues. The Republican proposal would 
provide no assistance, forcing local 
governments to make very difficult 
choices about cutting essential serv-
ices, including whether to lay off 
teachers, firefighters, and police offi-
cers or reduce trash collection and 
other essential services. 
And the Republican bill includes 
nothing to address broadband needs, 
depriving communities from making 
improvements in telehealth and re-
mote learning. 
And it doesn’t do nearly enough to 
address the needs of our small busi-
nesses. Congress must also provide ad-
ditional support to help small busi-
nesses survive the economic fallout 
caused by the COVID crisis. 
As a member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, I was proud to be part of 
the bipartisan working group that 
came up with the Paycheck Protection 
Program. As part of what we did for 
small businesses in the CARES Act, we 
greatly expanded and added a grant 
component to the Economic Injury Dis-
aster Loan Program. We provided 6 
months of relief for existing SBA bor-
rowers to make use of the 7(a), 504, and 
Microloan Programs. 
Our intent then was to deliver relief 
to small businesses that are truly hurt-
ing, and that effort has been largely 
successful. To date, 501 million small 
business borrowers have received more 
than $525 billion in assistance through 
PPP. That includes over 24,000 small 
businesses 
and 
nonprofits 
in 
New 
Hampshire and $2.5 billion that has 
come into our State alone. Over 11,000 
New Hampshire small businesses have 
received EIDL loans totaling over $660 
million.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6365 
October 21, 2020 
Collectively, 
these 
programs 
rep-
resent the largest small business relief 
effort in our Nation’s history by far, 
but we know that more needs to be 
done because there are some small 
businesses that have bounced back and 
are doing well and have returned to 
their pre-COVID revenues, but, unfor-
tunately, too many of them still need 
help to get through the rest of this 
pandemic. 
Authorization for PPP has expired 
with 
more 
than 
$130 
billion 
still 
unspent, and the funds appropriated for 
the EIDL Grant Program have been ex-
hausted. 
I hear frequently from New Hamp-
shire small businesses that have used 
PPP effectively to keep workers on the 
payroll and make rent, but many of 
them, as I said, still need more assist-
ance as our economy reopens, particu-
larly in the tourism and hospitality in-
dustries, which are so vital to New 
Hampshire’s economy. 
This is a critical time. Restaurants 
in New Hampshire account for nearly 
70,000 jobs and $3 billion in sales, ac-
cording to the National Restaurant As-
sociation. Hotels represent another 
29,000 jobs and $1 billion in wages and 
salaries, according to the American 
Hotel and Lodging Association. We 
have got to do more to help them. 
Now, based on these conversations, I 
worked with Senator CARDIN, the rank-
ing member on the Small Business 
Committee, and others to come up with 
legislation that recognizes the con-
tinuing need for small business assist-
ance. Our bill would extend the dead-
line for PPP applications and let busi-
nesses that have already received a 
PPP loan but are still struggling to 
apply again. It would streamline the 
process for borrowers to obtain forgive-
ness for their loans, and it would allow 
local chambers of commerce and des-
tination marketing organizations ac-
cess to the PPP program. It would also 
significantly increase funding for EIDL 
grants and make important reforms to 
that program. 
This and other measures must be 
part of any future COVID–19 relief 
package, and I would urge the majority 
leader to quickly bring a package of 
legislation to the floor that addresses 
both the public health crisis as well as 
the economic pain that our commu-
nities—especially 
our 
small 
busi-
nesses—are facing. 
COVID–19 is the worst crisis our 
country has faced during my lifetime. 
More than 220,000 Americans, including 
468 Granite Staters, have lost their 
lives to this virus, which has also 
taken a historic toll on our economy. 
Congress has an obligation to address 
this 
pandemic 
aggressively 
and 
thoughtfully. I am optimistic that we 
can come to bipartisan agreement, but 
we can’t wait until after the election. 
Americans need help putting food on 
the table and paying the bills today. 
Too many can’t afford an arbitrary 
timeline for delivering assistance. 
We need to set aside our differences 
and the partisan jockeying and do what 
is right for the Nation. That is what 
our constituents sent us here to do. We 
did it before, and we can do it again. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from New Mex-
ico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I join my 
Democratic colleagues today to voice 
my frustration with the Senate Repub-
licans’ drive to manufacture votes on 
anemic half measures instead of focus-
ing on enacting robust and comprehen-
sive COVID–19 relief for the American 
people. 
With over 220,000 deaths, positive 
cases surging throughout the country, 
and flu season right around the corner, 
it is unconscionable that we are not 
taking up legislation to address the 
health and economic needs facing this 
Nation. 
Simply put, this week’s votes have 
been engineered as political theater. 
They were designed to feign action, 
while failing, and to further divide this 
body along party lines while making no 
progress 
on 
another 
bipartisan 
coronavirus relief package. 
Earlier this summer, I took to the 
Senate floor to address the ongoing im-
pacts of COVID–19 on our Nation’s 
health and economy. The majority of 
the $8 billion in CARES Act relief fund-
ing had barely gotten out to Tribes by 
then, thanks to the administration’s 
delay and fumbled distribution. Now 
the administration wants Indian Coun-
try to believe it championed that fund-
ing for Tribal governments, but the 
truth is the administration and Senate 
Republican leaders offered nothing for 
Tribes in coronavirus relief. 
Tribes didn’t see progress until Sen-
ate Democrats fought back, demanding 
targeted relief for Tribal governments. 
We ended up securing over $10 billion 
to fight the virus, stabilize Tribal 
economies, and support Native health 
systems. 
Yes, it was obvious even then more 
would need to be done. I sounded the 
alarm that Native communities, like 
every American community, needed 
more help and were bearing the brunt 
of the virus’s continued spread. 
As vice chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs, I am com-
pelled to speak out again and urge im-
mediate bipartisan action to provide 
more targeted relief for Native commu-
nities and to urge my Republican col-
leagues who represent a number of Na-
tive communities to join me in this ef-
fort. Our shared trust and treaty obli-
gations demand nothing less. 
Throughout this pandemic, I have 
heard directly from Tribes, Pueblos, 
and 
Native 
Hawaiian 
communities 
about their urgent and ongoing needs 
for healthcare and economic resources 
to combat the virus. I have heard how 
existing Federal policies, practices, 
and program structures have left these 
communities particularly exposed to 
severe and long-lasting impacts from 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
In a recent oversight hearing on im-
plementation of Federal programs to 
support 
COVID–19 
response 
efforts, 
Tribal panelists testified about how 
their communities have been hurt by 
congressional inaction, funding short-
falls, and a lack of coordination be-
tween the Federal agencies. 
Among other things, we learned that 
existing Federal policies and failures 
have exacerbated health disparities, 
economic barriers, and institutional in-
equities among Native communities; 
that the Indian Health Service, Tribes, 
and Urban Indian Health clinics have 
faced challenges securing personal pro-
tective equipment and testing supplies; 
that they were excluded from most 
Federal public health emergency pre-
paredness planning; and that Indian 
Country continues to struggle to navi-
gate the bureaucratic maze of COVID– 
19 programs because many agencies 
had little to no meaningful engage-
ment with Tribes prior to this pan-
demic. 
This testimony is key to putting into 
context what little data exists on 
COVID–19 impacts in Native commu-
nities. 
Even though data was slow to come 
in, it confirms our worst fears; that the 
pandemic will extract a heavier toll on 
Native communities if decisive Federal 
actions aren’t taken immediately. 
Thirty four percent of American In-
dian and Alaska Native adults—the 
highest percentage of any race—are at 
high risk of serious health complica-
tions due to COVID–19; and they are 41⁄2 
times more likely to be hospitalized 
due to COVID–19 complications. These 
statistics are staggering, and they ap-
pear to be worsening in parts of Indian 
Country. 
Just this week, Indian Health Service 
officials told Congress that COVID–19 
trends in the Bemidji, Billings, Great 
Plains, and Oklahoma City service 
areas were ‘‘very concerning.’’ Each of 
those regions have had a 7-day rolling 
positivity test rate in double digits. 
Several IHS service units are reporting 
that their network for transferring pa-
tients in need of ICU care are nearly 
full. 
There is so much we still don’t know 
about COVID–19. But what we do know 
is this: Throughout this crisis, Native 
communities have fought back. They 
are resilient. For example, in my home 
State of New Mexico and in Arizona 
and Utah—the Navajo Nation has insti-
tuted strict curfews to prevent the 
spread. They have ramped up testing, 
despite the complete lack of testing 
supplies in the beginning. But the U.S. 
trust and treaty responsibilities re-
main. 
Our obligation to provide quality, ac-
cessible healthcare to all Native Amer-
icans doesn’t end with this once-in-a- 
century pandemic. And it cannot be 
fulfilled by partisan half measures 
meant to score political points rather 
than provide meaningful health. 
Congress must do better. We must do 
much more. Each day we fail to act—to 
advance policies to address the dispari-
ties faced by Indian Country—is a day

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6366 
October 21, 2020 
we fail to uphold our oath of office. It 
is a day we fail to meet the single most 
defining moment of this Congress—per-
haps, of our entire careers. 
American families are struggling. 
Our country is struggling. We in Con-
gress have the tools to help end that. 
Instead, we are wasting time with 
sham votes. History will not forget this 
inaction. That is why it is imperative 
that we pass comprehensive COVID–19 
relief legislation with targeted re-
sources for Native American commu-
nities. 
We must infuse the IHS with addi-
tional funding for Tribal healthcare 
and ensure Indian Country has parity 
in accessing Federal public health pro-
grams. We must provide Tribal govern-
ments with the resources they need to 
keep their communities up and running 
safely by providing additional funding 
within the Treasury’s Coronavirus Re-
lief Fund. 
The Senate should pass bills I have 
introduced that have already been 
adopted by the House of Representa-
tives in its Heroes Act, passed over 3 
months ago. We must make the stra-
tegic national stockpile available to 
Tribes. Tribes should be able to access 
PPE, ventilators, and other necessary 
medical equipment, just as States can. 
We must make sure the Tribes have 
equal access to the Centers for Disease 
Control resources to prepare for public 
health emergencies, like this pan-
demic. We must equalize the Medicaid 
reimbursement rate for Urban Indian 
Health facilities and help the 41 Urban 
Indian Health facilities across the Na-
tion expand their services. 
And as so much of our lives move to 
the internet, we must make sure that 
Native schools, healthcare facilities, 
and government services are not left on 
the wrong side of the digital divide. All 
Tribes must have access to high-speed 
broadband. 
This public health and economic cri-
sis has impacted every community in 
every State in the Union, but it has hit 
Native communities particularly hard. 
We must take real action. We need to 
lock arms, negotiate in good faith, and 
get immediate relief out the door—not 
engage in insincere, sham votes on 
‘‘skinny’’ relief bills going nowhere, 
marked by continued partisan bick-
ering. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, by 
now, the American people know the 
rank hypocrisy of the Republican ma-
jority, who, so many, when Merrick 
Garland was proposed as a nominee, 
said we must wait, even though it was 
8 months before an election. When 
Merrick Garland was nominated 8 
months before an election, we have to 
wait for an election. Now that an elec-
tion is ongoing, we are rushing through 
this nomination. It is one of the worst 
moments the Senate has ever seen. 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Repub-
lican majority have defiled the Senate, 
and one can wonder if it will ever re-
cover from this kind of rank hypocrisy. 
And so, because this has been the most 
rushed, most partisan, and least legiti-
mate process in the history of Supreme 
Court nominations, Judiciary members 
will boycott the markup tomorrow and 
not provide the quorum that is re-
quired 
because 
it 
is 
a 
bipartisan 
quorum. 
The bottom line is very simple. We 
should not be moving forward on this 
nomination. She is so out of character 
with American views. Her views are 
way, way, way to the right. She has 
stated she wants to repeal the ACA and 
take away healthcare. She has said she 
would oppose Roe v. Wade and remove 
American women’s right to control 
their own bodies. She has opposed labor 
rights. She is to the right of Justice 
Scalia on gun safety. 
On issue after issue, this nominee is 
so far out of the mainstream that her 
views, if she had to get them to pass in 
a legislature, would never pass even 
with all Republicans. But, of course, 
now they are rushing through the proc-
ess. 
Trump has said he wants someone 
who repeals ACA. Trump has said he 
wants someone who would repeal Roe. 
Trump has said he wants someone who 
would be on his side if there is an elec-
tion dispute. 
These are all such violations of 
American norms, values, decency, and 
honor. And that is why the Judiciary 
Committee 
will 
not 
provide 
the 
quorum tomorrow when the markup 
goes forward. 
We should also adjourn. We should 
not do this nomination. We can come 
back after the election and do just 
what Republicans have said they want-
ed to do when Merrick Garland was on 
the floor: wait for the election to de-
cide. 
And this sophistry that now because 
it is a Republican President and a Re-
publican majority, that makes a dif-
ference? No. Everyone sees through 
that. That was never mentioned when 
Merrick Garland came up. It only came 
now with a coverup—to cover up the 
hypocrisy, and it just doesn’t work. We 
can see through it. 
The bottom line, we have never 
moved a nominee so close to an elec-
tion. Abraham Lincoln, when he had 
the opportunity to fill a Supreme 
Court seat, said it would be unfair to 
do it so close to an election. But this 
Republican Party has forgotten the 
principles and the honor and the de-
cency of Abraham Lincoln as they 
move forward in their rush—in their 
rush—to push a nominee through, 
whose views are decidedly at odds with 
the vast majority of Americans on 
issue after issue. That is why the Judi-
ciary Committee members will boycott 
tomorrow. That is also why I am going 
to move to adjourn until November 9, 
after the election is decided and do 
what is fair and right for the American 
people. 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. President, I move to adjourn and 
to then convene for pro forma sessions 
only, with no business being conducted, 
at 12 noon on the following dates and 
that following each pro forma session, 
the Senate adjourn until the next pro 
forma session: Friday, October 23; 
Tuesday, October 27; Friday, October 
30; Tuesday, November 3; and Friday, 
November 6. Furthermore, that if there 
is an agreement on legislation in rela-
tion to the COVID pandemic, the Sen-
ate may convene under the authority 
of S. Res. 296 of the 108th Congress; and 
that, finally, when the Senate adjourns 
on Friday, November 6, it next convene 
at 4:30, Monday, November 9, and that 
following the prayer and pledge, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the 
Journal of proceedings be approved to 
date, the time for the two leaders be 
reserved for their use later in the day, 
and morning business be closed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That mo-
tion would require consent and is not 
in order. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ap-
peal the ruling of the Chair, and I move 
to table the appeal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas 
and nays. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from California (Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN), the Senator from California 
(Ms. HARRIS), the Senator from West 
Virginia (Mr. MANCHIN), the Senator 
from Vermont (Mr. SANDERS), the Sen-
ator from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA), and 
the Senator from Oregon (Mr. WYDEN), 
are necessarily absent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there

siring to vote?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-

The Senator from Georgia. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, as 
the first U.S. Senator to call for the 
nomination and confirmation to fill 
Justice Ginsburg’s seat before the No-
vember 3 election, I am proud to sup-
port Judge Amy Coney Barrett as 
President Trump’s nominee for Asso-
ciate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court, but I am not the only one who is 
proud. Two weeks ago I joined Con-
cerned Women for America in Mari-
etta, GA, to kick off their nationwide 
bus tour in support of Judge Barrett’s 
confirmation. Dozens attended, includ-
ing men and women from every walk of 
life—families, business owners, policy-
makers, faith leaders, and students. 
Judge Barrett has inspired millions 
of us across our country. She has 
reached the pinnacle of her profession, 
while upholding her Christian faith and 
values. She is a wife and a mother of 
seven children. She will become the 
first woman to serve on the Supreme 
Court with school-aged children. 
Now the majority of Americans in 
the most recent Gallup poll agree we 
should vote to confirm her. 
As I have traveled around the Peach 
State, the enthusiasm and admiration I 
hear from Georgians is very clear. 
President Trump established a group of 
highly qualified candidates for the 
bench. He was transparent and well 
prepared for the moment. It is clear 
that he could not have made a better 
nomination. 
Judge Barrett is a woman of remark-
able intellect and character, with the 
judicial philosophy of originalism, and, 
as a textualist, she understands and re-
spects the Court’s role to interpret the 
law as written. As such, I believe Judge 
Barrett will uphold the Constitution in 
protecting our God-given rights, in-
cluding the right to life, the Second 
Amendment, free speech, and religious 
liberty. 
The need for judges who will uphold 
the intent of the Framers is especially 
clear when the left is showing their dis-
regard for our Constitution. Democrats 
are attempting to change article I and 
trying to federalize the election system 
through the creation of a national uni-
versal ballot system, and NANCY PELOSI 
has 
attempted 
to 
politicize 
and 
weaponize the 25th Amendment in an-
other desperate move to form a com-
mittee to remove an elected President. 
That is why I introduced a resolution 
condemning the Speaker for her polit-
ical gains in the middle of an election 
while refusing to support relief for 
hard-working families impacted by this 
pandemic. 
Now, Big Tech is aggressively lim-
iting the First Amendment right to 
free speech and free press. Created be-
fore the existence of the very compa-
nies that are silencing conservatives, 
the 
1996 
Communications 
Decency 
Act’s section 230 provision no longer 
suits our country’s needs. Last week, 
Justice Clarence Thomas called on 
Congress to update these laws to 
‘‘make them more appropriate for an 
Internet-driven society.’’ 
In the Senate I am leading the charge 
to modernize the law to suit the reality 
of the digital marketplace of ideas by 
introducing the Stopping Big Tech’s 
Censorship Act in June to give all 
Americans a process to bring claims 
against companies when they remove 
or limit constitutionally protected free 
speech. 
Today I introduced a bill to elimi-
nate ambiguous language in section 230 
and to codify the more concrete terms 
recommended by the Department of 
Justice. 
In Congress we must act to hold Big 
Tech accountable, but we also must 
have strong judges in our courts who 
will uphold the Constitutional rights of 
all Americans. That is why it is con-
cerning that Democrats are fighting so 
hard to oppose an eminently qualified 
nominee. As retaliation, they have 
threatened to pack the Court if we fol-
low clear precedent in filling this seat, 
attempting to constrain our well de-
signed system of checks and balances. 
Unable to criticize Judge Barrett’s 
sterling credentials, Democrats have 
resorted to scare tactics, claiming she 
will take away healthcare coverage or 
advance her own policy views. At her 
confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett 
put those leftwing talking points to 
rest, saying: ‘‘It is never appropriate 
for a judge to impose that judge’s per-
sonal convictions, whether they derive 
from faith or anywhere else, on the 
law.’’ 
These accusations make clear that 
there is little Democrats fear more 
than strong, conservative women. I 
know firsthand what it is like to step 
into public service and then be at-
tacked by the left and the fake news. 
There is a playbook for trying to stop 
conservative women and their place in 
public service. 
Nonetheless, Judge Barrett has been 
the definition of grace under pressure. 
At her confirmation hearing, Senator 
GRAHAM asked why she decided to put 
her family in the spotlight and accept 
the President’s request to serve. She 
said, abridged: 
We knew that our lives would be combed 
over for any negative detail. . . . our faith 
would be caricatured. . . . the benefit . . . is 
that I’m committed to the rule of law . . . 
and dispensing equal justice for all. 
Judge Barrett’s commitment to the 
rule of law and equal justice are clear 
from her writings, decisions, and testi-
mony. In fact, on the Seventh Circuit, 
95 percent of her adjudicated cases 
were unanimously decided. 
I am so grateful that Judge Barrett 
has accepted the call to serve our coun-
try. President Trump could not have 
chosen a more qualified, impressive ju-
rist than Judge Barrett, and I will be 
honored to vote to confirm her as the 
next U.S. Supreme Court Justice. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Would my colleague 
yield for a question? 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Sure. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. 
You know that the process we are in 
right now is based on clear precedent. 
I have scoured American history to 
find the precedent of conducting a de-
bate and vote on a Supreme Court 
nominee during an election, and I 
haven’t found it. So I just wanted to 
check in on, essentially, what am I 
missing? Where is there a precedent for 
conducting this debate and this vote 
during an election? 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Thank you for the 
question. 
There have been 29 such cases. When, 
in fact, the executive branch and the 
Senate are controlled by the same 
party, the nomination proceeds, and 
that is the case that we are now in, and 
we will proceed with the vote and the 
nomination. 
Mr. MERKLEY. So thank you to my 
colleague. I think what you are con-
firming is that never in American his-
tory have we conducted such a debate 
and voted during an election. You have 
a different precedent argument but not 
a precedent that shows that conducting 
this debate during an election is appro-
priate. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. The President is 
the President for 4 years—for a full 4- 
year term—and we will carry out our 
Constitutional duty. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my col-
league, because, 4 years ago, I was on 
this floor, and I know you weren’t here 
in the Chamber, and I listened to so 
many Members of the Senate say that 
they were establishing a new prece-
dent—a precedent they felt was a 
precedent born of deep conviction, pas-
sionate conviction, that there should 
never be a debate and a vote during an 
election year, not just during the elec-
tion. We are already in the process of 
casting ballots, but never in an elec-
tion year. 
So that also is a precedent set 4 years 
ago that this is overturning; is that not 
correct? 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. No, that is not cor-
rect. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, may 
I respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia has the floor. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, I 
will yield the floor to my colleague 
from Wyoming.

ator from Wyoming.

guished Senator from Georgia. She has

shown a strong voice and strong leader-
ship in this, and, of course, she knows 
that 29 times, as she was trying to ex-
plain before being interrupted, that 
there have been vacancies in an elec-
tion year of the Supreme Court. It hap-
pened. 
What we know, historically, if we 
talk about historical precedence, is if 
the President, asked by the Constitu-
tion—told by the Constitution to nomi-
nate, and if the Senate is of the same 
party as the President, generally, that 
person gets confirmed. 
But on the other hand, if the Presi-
dent who nominates is of a different 
party than the Senate—which is what 
happened in 2016 with Merrick Garland 
after the Republicans had won the Sen-
ate—that nominee, historically, is not 
confirmed. That is the history going 
through the U.S. Senate confirmations. 
The Constitution is clear. The Presi-
dent nominates, then advice and con-
sent by the Senate, and we know what 
happens there, generally—same party, 
consent happens; different parties, di-
vided government, and that is what 
happened in 2016. President Obama was 
reelected in 2014, but come 2016, the 
American people voted to put the Re-
publican Party in the majority. 
So I actually have my dates wrong. It 
was 2012 that President Obama was re-
elected, and in 2014, the majority went 
to the Republican Party. So when a va-
cancy occurred in 2016, we had, as I 
stated, the majority—a President of 
one party and a Senate majority in the 
other, and the nominee, through advice 
and consent, was not confirmed. 
That is what I am talking about, 
when I see this ongoing abuse of the 
nominee, whom I had a chance to meet 
with today who believes in the Con-
stitution, follows the Constitution, is 
true on the Constitution—and that is 
why the people of Wyoming are so de-
lighted with her nomination and why I 
am so happy to support her. But I ap-
preciate the Senator from Georgia for 
letting me come in a little bit on her 
time. I am just grateful for her leader-
ship and the strong statement she is 
making on behalf of this very impres-
sive, well-qualified judge. 
I am really looking forward to voting 
to confirm her to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
I apologize to the Senator from Geor-
gia if she has additional remarks to 
make. 
Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague 
from Georgia, do you have additional 
remarks to make? 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. No, I really don’t. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very 
much. 
To my colleague from Wyoming, 
would you yield for a question? 
Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I have some-
thing to present, and I have the mic at 
this point to speak and I would like to 
complete that. And I know the Senator 
from Oregon is scheduled to speak after 
that, so if we could just go in regular 
order, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular 
order. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Let the record note 
that my colleague— 
Mr. BARRASSO. And I appreciate 
the remarks of the Senator from Geor-
gia, and I come to the floor today also 
in support of the nomination of Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
I will state that she is terrific. She is 
so impressive—so exceptionally well 
qualified to take on this new responsi-
bility. 
But the partisanship that she has ex-
perienced from Democrats—well, it has 
predictably backfired on them, cer-
tainly by the American people. The 
majority of Americans of all parties, a 
majority of Americans have said get 
her confirmed—put her on the Supreme 
Court because that is what they saw 
when they watched the hearings last 
week—somebody who is ready to serve 
our Nation and apply the law, not leg-
islate from the Bench. 
This is an important moment in our 
history. Judge Barrett, the Senate, the 
American people deserved a hearing 
that matched the moment and that 
highlighted her qualifications and ca-
pabilities. Regrettably, Americans got 
a 
weeklong 
lecture 
by 
Democrats 
which turned out to be a partisan info-
mercial on ObamaCare. 
This is a law that 10 years on, Demo-
crats are still trying to explain to the 
American people, still trying to ex-
plain how many—all these millions and 
millions of people who lost their health 
insurance, trying to explain millions 
and millions of people whose costs 
went up—more than doubled. 
Judge Barrett is very clear and has 
been clear. She has no agenda for any 
case, and as a judge she considers each 
case on the merits. 
There is only one real explanation for 
Democrats’ 
fixation 
on 
ObamaCare 
during the Supreme Court hearing. 
They are trying to score political 
points, appeal to their far-left base be-
fore an election. It is shameful. It is a 
scare tactic. 
I hear scare tactics and false attacks 
on healthcare that frighten people. 
That is not the way we ought to be 
doing things. They never mentioned 
that Senate Republicans have voted 
now five times to protect people with 
preexisting conditions, including today 
on the bill that every one of those 
Democrats voted against with a tar-
geted relief plan. There was a compo-
nent in that to make sure that people 
with preexisting conditions were pro-
tected and that coronavirus is now list-
ed as a preexisting condition. Every 
Democrat 
voted 
against 
adding 
coronavirus as a preexisting condition. 
Every Republican today voted in favor. 
So Democrats seem to be trying to 
make a standard confirmation process 
about anything other than the quali-
fications of an exceptionally qualified 
nominee. 
The Presiding Officer has seen this, 
and we have talked about this. These 
attacks began before her nomination 
was even announced. She was criticized 
for being a mom, criticized for having 
seven children, and criticized for going 
to 
church—criticized 
for 
going 
to 
church. There are Democratic can-
didates now running for the U.S. Sen-
ate criticizing her religion or faith in 
God. Astonishing. 
The delay tactics and the defamation 
has continued. We have seen this be-
fore. The American people saw through 
the Democrats’ disturbing attacks on 
Brett Kavanaugh 2 years ago. Ameri-
cans rejected the cheap character as-
sassination. They rejected the low 
road, and now Democrats are leaving 
open the possibility—and I hear this 
from Members of this body—Members 
of this body, as well as candidates for 
the U.S. Senate. They are leaving open 
the possibility that if they win the 
election, if they take the White House, 
if they take the Senate, of expanding 
the size of the U.S. Supreme Court—ex-
panding the size from 9 to 11 or 13. 
They haven’t decided yet. 
The 
Presidential 
candidate 
won’t 
even announce what his thoughts are 
on it. He won’t say. He won’t tell the 
American people. Oh, wait until after 
the election is over. It is just like it 
was with ObamaCare, first you have to 
pass it before you get to find out what 
is in it. 
The size of the Supreme Court has 
been nine for 150 years—since 1869. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg said nine is the 
right number. She said to go beyond 
that would be politicizing it. But that 
is what we see happening today with 
the sorts of threats that we see coming 
from the other side of the aisle. 
What do the American people think 
about that? Well, the New York Times 
poll this week—58 percent of voters 
said they are against adding additional 
members to the Supreme Court. How 
many favored? Just 31 percent, but 
they are the liberal activist base of the 
Democratic Party. That is who they 
are. Those are the ones who want to 
call the tune if they have NANCY 
PELOSI as Speaker of the House and 
CHUCK SCHUMER as majority leader and 
Joe Biden in the White House. 
That is why Joe Biden won’t tell the 
American people what he plans to do. 
Let me just get through that Ameri-
cans can rest assured that Republicans 
in the Senate are committed to this 
nominee. Just as the Senator from 
Georgia has just said and as I have said 
and others have said, Republicans in 
this body are committed to this nomi-
nee. We will confirm this exceptional 
Justice regardless of the delay tactics, 
regardless of the seek-and-destroy mis-
sion the Democrats have launched. We 
are going to confirm this exceptional 
Justice to uphold the law as written. 
The Senate will vote, and the Senate 
will confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Georgia for 
yielding to a question. It was not that

October 21, 2020 
long ago that we actually had con-
versations and debate on the floor of 
the Senate, and now when we are even 
in debate on bills, we don’t have dia-
logue back and forth. So I appreciate 
the Senator attempting to answer my 
question about precedent. 
Let’s be clear. This is a precedent- 
shattering event. This is not consistent 
with the history of the United States. 
In fact, we have seen a situation 
where never in our history has any 
President asked for a debate and vote 
during an election. So that shatters a 
precedent. Never before in our history 
have we had a majority leader agree to 
hold a debate and a vote during an 
election. So that shatters a precedent. 
Then there is the President Lincoln 
precedent in which he deliberately 
said: We are not going to violate the 
sanctity of a vote. I don’t want you to 
debate and vote during an election. 
Now, Lincoln happened to be a Re-
publican President, but he cared about 
the institution. He cared about the 
Constitution. He cared about the voice 
of the American people, and so he said 
the two shouldn’t exist together. 
Then, of course, there is the McCon-
nell precedent from 4 years ago, in 
which MCCONNELL came to the floor 
and was supported by his caucus and 
said there should never ever be a de-
bate or a vote of a nominee during an 
election year. 
Now, my colleague from Wyoming 
just noted, well, he has a new theory 
about split government and unified 
government. Well, that theory wasn’t 
here on the floor 4 years ago. That 
wasn’t part of the McConnell prece-
dent. That is called an after-the-fact 
justification of an inconsistent posi-
tion. 
In fact, so many colleagues across 
the aisle came to the floor and said: I 
have this deep and passionate convic-
tion that I want to defend the Con-
stitution. There should never be a de-
bate on a Supreme Court Justice dur-
ing an election year. And now every 
single one of them coming before us is 
saying: Well, you know that deep pas-
sionate conviction I had 4 years ago? It 
was a convenience of political power to 
make that argument because what I 
was really saying is, we, as Repub-
licans, don’t want to debate a nominee 
from a Democratic President. We only 
want to debate a nominee from a Re-
publican President. 
Well, I am shocked really by the 
complete lack of integrity. I am 
shocked that arguments are being put 
forward that were never raised on the 
floor 4 years ago about split govern-
ment as some justification. I guess I 
am not so shocked about the power 
grab involved because it began some 40 
years ago when a group of very 
wealthy, very White people got to-
gether and said: We don’t like this vi-
sion of government of, by, and for the 
people, because, you know, the people 
kind of like things we don’t want. We 
want to rig the tax system so we pay 
very little. We want to get those tax 
deductions and those tax subsidies. We 
want to make sure that people of com-
munities of color don’t vote. We want 
to be able to suppress the vote. How do 
we do that? 
Well, you know, the problem is that 
people who are elected get elected by 
the people, and we might be able to in-
fluence those campaigns some of the 
time, but, you know what? There is one 
institution not subject to the vote of 
the people—the Court. If we can cor-
rupt the Court, we, this very small 
group of White, wealthy power brokers 
in America can control this country 
and install government by and for the 
powerful, rather than our constitu-
tional vision of government by and for 
the people. So this is a norm-shat-
tering, precedent-shattering situation. 
There have only been two real objec-
tives by the leadership of this body 
over the last 4 years. One was a $2 tril-
lion tax cut—$2 trillion with a ‘‘t’’— 
with virtually all the benefits going to 
the richest Americans. You know, if a 
thief grabs an orange off a stand, they 
might go to prison for 6 months or a 
loaf of bread, maybe they will get a 
couple years. But through this bill, $2 
trillion from the American Treasury 
was given to the richest, most powerful 
Americans. Well, that is certainly not 
government by and for the people. That 
was one objective. 
The other objective was to dismantle 
healthcare for ordinary Americans who 
aren’t rich and powerful. Let’s tear 
down the ACA. Well, in my State, 
400,000 Oregonians proceeded to gain 
healthcare through the expansion of 
Medicaid and the ACA, and since 
March, add another 120,000 to that 
list—120,000 more. Why? Because they 
are losing their jobs. They are losing 
their jobs in this economic implosion 
caused by the failure to address the 
pandemic. 
The people in Oregon—I go to every 
county every year. I have a townhall in 
every county, and most of my counties 
are deep red—as red as anywhere you 
will find in the country. 
And do you know what? People say: 
Healthcare bill of rights, thank God for 
that. What are they talking about? 
Children can be on their policy until 
age 26. They think that is a step for-
ward. I know because I have been out 
there every year, and I ask them: Chil-
dren on your policy until age 26, how 
many people here like it? These are 
very, very Republican and very, very 
conservative rural areas. No, we like 
that. 
Tax credits so lower income families 
can afford to buy health insurance on 
the marketplace? Oh, no, we like that. 
Having a marketplace where you can 
compare policies, one to the other? Oh, 
no, no, we like that. 
Having preventive conditions covered 
because an ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure? Oh, yes, we 
think that is a step forward. That is in 
these conservative, red districts. 
And the expansion of Medicaid? A 
lifesaver. 
Do you know what happens at these 
rural townhalls? People who are at the 
local healthcare clinics stand up and 
say: You know, we doubled the size of 
our healthcare clinic because now our 
very low-income constituents can pay 
the bill, so we have been able to hire 
more people. We have a substance ad-
diction program now that we didn’t 
have before. We have a mental health 
program we didn’t have before. Don’t 
take that away from us. We really love 
our rural healthcare clinic. We love the 
investment in rural clinics that the 
ACA made. That list goes on and on. 
My colleague from Wyoming said 
that there is this whole scare tactic 
about 
healthcare. 
Yes, 
people 
are 
scared, not because we are saying they 
are scared but because they are calling 
our offices and saying: We are worried. 
They are saying they are worried be-
cause they heard the President of the 
United States say: I am only going to 
nominate a person who will tear down 
the ACA and will strike down Roe v. 
Wade. Don’t you trust the word of the 
President of the United States to do 
what he said? He said it repeatedly. He 
said that was his goal. 
And he said to the Federalist Soci-
ety: Go get me nominees who can com-
plete my goals. The Federalist Society 
has been at work now for four decades 
to bias the courts for the wealthy and 
powerful. That is what they are all 
about. It is about preventing people of 
color from voting. Now it has expanded 
to college students. Now it has ex-
panded to Native American reserva-
tions. Now it has expanded to poor 
communities. 
Oh, we see the manipulation being 
planned on election day because now 
there is a Court that by 5 to 4 gutted 
the Voting Rights Act and allows voter 
intimidation in this country and allows 
voter suppression. So we see the ef-
forts. You decrease the number of poll-
ing places where you don’t want people 
to vote. You move them so people 
aren’t sure where to go. You understaff 
them so there are long lines in blue dis-
tricts and short lines in red districts. 
You stick machines in there that don’t 
work so well. Maybe that will slow 
things down. You put out messages 
saying ‘‘Thank you for voting last 
week’’ to confuse people when the vote 
is actually coming up next week. You 
say: Oh, by the way, you can use any 
State ID to vote, but you can’t use a 
college ID. This is because they don’t 
want college students to vote. 
You know, I am proud of the Con-
stitution of the United States. I am 
proud of the vision of voter empower-
ment, citizen engagement, and partici-
pation as a foundation for what we do 
in this country. But I have really been 
stunned by the scope of those in this 
Chamber who believe in voter suppres-
sion and intimidation. I am stunned 
that they don’t share the view of a gov-
ernment of, by, and for the people be-
cause that is the oath of office we took. 
It was to our Constitution. 
I am also stunned that it has been 5 
months since the Heroes Act was

passed in the House, and this body has

Secretary and the Speaker ready to 
reach a deal, and the leader of this 
body is saying: Don’t do it. For 5 
months, don’t do it. 
I always think of the phrase you hear 
growing up: Rome burned while Nero 
fiddled. Well, America suffers while the 
Senate slumbers under the leadership 
that says: No vote on a comprehensive 
package to help both the healthcare 
pandemic and the economic implosion 
that is associated with it. 
There are 220,000-plus Americans who 
lie in the grave because President 
Trump refused to have a national 
strategy on personal protective equip-
ment, because President Trump refused 
to have a national strategy on testing, 
because President Trump refused to 
have a national strategy on contact 
tracing, and because President Trump 
decided to try to continue the polariza-
tion of America over the use of masks 
and 
social 
distancing 
rather 
than 
bringing America together to fight 
this. 
Now, some say: You know, couldn’t 
America do just as well as Canada? 
Couldn’t we do just as well as our 
neighbor to the north? Don’t we have 
more resources than they have? Don’t 
we have more research institutions 
than they have? Can’t we do just as 
well as the Canadians? 
Well, if we had done as well as the 
Canadians, 
135,000 
fewer 
Americans 
would have died if we had the same 
deaths per capita as the Canadians. 
There are 135,000 deaths lying at the 
doorstep of the Oval Office and this 
Chamber, sitting on its hands for the 
last 5 months—not investing in testing 
and tracing, not insisting we have an 
aggressive strategy from the very 
start, and working in partnership with 
the incompetence of the President to 
make the pandemic so much worse for 
America. There are so many more peo-
ple infected, so many more people 
dead, and so many people damaged for 
a lifetime by the experience of being 
sick with coronavirus and then having 
lasting side effects. 
And what else? Country after country 
is putting their economy back together 
because they don’t have coronavirus in 
any significant numbers anymore—Tai-
wan and South Korea. But as long as 
you have this pandemic, you damage 
the economy. So not only have people 
died and people suffered with the ill-
ness and not only will they carry con-
sequences forward, but the number of 
people who have lost their jobs—that is 
a big deal. 
Just last week, we saw the highest 
jump in jobless claims since August 
with about 900,000 Americans filing for 
unemployment. I live in a blue-collar 
community. I grew up in a blue-collar 
community. My dad was a mechanic. I 
went to the public schools. My kids 
went to the same public schools. I can 
tell you that those lost jobs affect 
those who have the least resources to 
tide them over. 
Back in April, 40 percent of the peo-
ple who earned $40,000 or less lost a job. 
That was in April. So there is a lot of 
suffering going on economically, as 
well as in healthcare. We need to do ev-
erything in our power to help those 
families weather this storm—not sit on 
our hands for 5 months and not talk 
about the emaciated package that was 
put on the floor, one that is cutting to 
a fraction the previous Republican 
package, which was pretty darn skin-
ny. 
We have a responsibility to address 
unemployment insurance that has tied 
hard-working 
blue-collar 
Americans 
through. I know that for many of my 
colleagues, all they want is to rebuild 
the economy from the rich down—from 
Wall Street down. But do you know 
what? That just increases the wealth 
and income inequality. Do you know 
how effective those extra unemploy-
ment checks were in keeping people 
working and buying products because 
then other companies were employed 
and they could pay their mortgages, 
they could pay their utilities, they 
could pay their rent, they could buy 
their groceries, and keep the economy 
moving? 
But the extension of that has been 
blocked by the leadership of this body. 
The leadership of this body, the major-
ity party, has refused to invest in that 
national strategy of testing and trac-
ing, which is essential in every country 
that 
has 
gotten 
ahead 
of 
the 
coronavirus. They are restoring their 
economies. They are supercharging 
their economies because the disease is 
out of the way. They invested in test-
ing and tracing, but the leadership of 
this Chamber has ensured the pan-
demic gets worse and afflicted our 
economy in the process. 
It may not matter to rich folks 
across this country who have seen 
their S&P 500 index go through the 
roof. Why is it going through the roof? 
Because those companies are replacing 
the products produced by small busi-
ness across America. Hundreds of thou-
sands of small businesses have been 
ravaged and destroyed by this lost 
economy. OK, the S&P 500 is doing 
fine; your stock portfolio is doing fine. 
But Americans—ordinary Americans 
are not doing fine. 
The majority in this Chamber did not 
want to increase the Medicaid match-
ing 
rate 
to 
strengthen 
healthcare 
across this country. Why is it so impor-
tant? Because the States have lost so 
many revenues during this downturn, 
and in the process, people losing their 
jobs lose their employer-based health 
insurance and, therefore, need to qual-
ify for Medicaid. On and on, one issue 
after another—it is an issue of basic de-
cency and of basic humanity to address 
the challenges Americans are faced 
with because of the incompetence of 
the President’s efforts to address the 
pandemic, and it has produced, there-
fore, an economy that is just a sham-
bles. 
One of the things that ordinary fami-
lies face is having their utilities cut 
off. We know how essential it is to have 
water, to have electricity, and to have 
broadband to get through this. This 
whole crisis has shined a light on the 
importance 
of 
broadband. 
That 
broadband is necessary to apply for em-
ployment. That broadband is necessary 
for the school children to go to class. 
That broadband is necessary for the 
college students to go to class. That 
broadband is necessary for every fam-
ily to stay in contact with their friends 
and family. That broadband is nec-
essary to follow the national news. It is 
at the heart of the communications of 
America, so cutting it off is unaccept-
able. 
Turning off the electricity is unac-
ceptable. You can’t have a computer or 
broadband if electricity is turned off. 
You can’t have light and heat as winter 
approaches if it is turned off. Water is 
essential to health. You can’t have 
basic sanitation if you don’t have ac-
cess to water. 
So let’s make sure we protect ordi-
nary families. Let’s make sure they 
have the electricity, they have the 
water, and they have the broadband. 
Let’s not let American families be put 
at such risk. 
Now, yes, there are States and cities 
that have taken action and produced 
such moratoriums, but aren’t we all 
America together? Instead of a patch-
work of neighborhoods that got some 
help and protection and ones that 
didn’t, why don’t we stand together as 
Americans and protect the utilities? 
That is what we should be doing right 
now with a robust bill—a robust bill to 
address the pandemic and to address 
the economic implosion. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the HELP Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4362 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered and read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Reserving the right to 
object, I served as an economic regu-
lator of utilities for nearly 10 years be-
fore coming to Congress. This idea of a 
moratorium—a national moratorium— 
violates all kinds of things, not the 
least of which, by the way, seems to me 
to be, at the very least, the spirit, if 
not the literal Constitution that my 
colleague from Oregon says he is so 
proud of. 
Remember, the States created the 
Federal Government, not the other 
way around. As a State regulator of 
natural gas and electric utilities, I saw

from time to time the attempted over-
reach of the Federal Government to 
mandate things. It violates the prin-
ciples of the Constitution, and it vio-
lates, really, the best practices of 
States’ rights, of communities’ rights, 
of rural electric’s rights because it as-
sumes that somehow we here in these 
Chambers know better than the utility 
regulators who are appointed by Gov-
ernors—the ones who are elected, like I 
was—the municipalities that set the 
rates for water and sewer; that some-
how we are better equipped to make 
the decisions for a local utility and, 
yes, their consumers; that somehow we 
are better at doing that. It makes no 
sense. In fact, it would be very harmful 
to the very consumers the Senator 
from Oregon says he wants to look out 
for. 
Let’s just take some examples. Utili-
ties are not capitalized to provide serv-
ices for free. That is what this bill 
would do. And guess what happens to a 
regulated utility, an investor-owned 
utility, when something like this hap-
pens, when the Federal Government 
throws a wrench into their local rate 
structure. Well, somebody eventually 
has to pay for that. And guess how the 
money is raised to pay for the morato-
rium? The rates go up. They have to. 
That is how rate structure is designed. 
If you are a utility—let’s say a rural 
electric cooperative or a rural tele-
phone cooperative that is providing 
broadband—that is even better yet be-
cause it is actually the consumers who 
are the board of directors. It is the 
most direct experiment of self-govern-
ance that we have. 
So let’s please leave the regulation to 
the locals and to the States. If there is 
a need for a moratorium or a design for 
some different structure, they can do it 
in concert with the consumers, the reg-
ulators, and, of course, the utilities in 
a way that does the least harm. That 
makes all the sense in the world. 
But here is, in my mind, the richest 
irony of this moment. The Senator 
from Oregon talked about the high un-
employment rate, the large unemploy-
ment numbers. Just today we had the 
opportunity on this floor, when Repub-
licans brought a bill that would have 
provided $300 a week of federally fund-
ed supplement to unemployment insur-
ance benefits to those unemployed peo-
ple—$300 a week—do you know how 
many utility bills that would have 
helped pay without disrupting the util-
ities’ rate structure? Just today we had 
that moment, and the Senator from Or-
egon and every one of his Democratic 
colleagues voted against it—not for the 
first time, by the way, but for the sec-
ond time. And here we are tonight 
coming up with a piecemeal solution 
when the more comprehensive one was 
rejected. 
So for those reasons and several oth-
ers I could think of, but the hour is 
getting late, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, my 
colleague not only objected but laid 
out his thinking on the idea that has 
been adopted at local governments 
across the country, and he said it is un-
constitutional. Of course he didn’t 
bother to actually check to see if it 
was unconstitutional because, no, it is 
not. If it was, it would have been ended 
in all of those places at the State and 
local levels where it had been done. So 
much for that false argument. 
He brings in his experience as a regu-
lator, but it might be helpful to actu-
ally check the lawbooks before making 
a spurious argument. 
Then he says: You know, a morato-
rium would hurt ordinary families. 
Well, try talking to an ordinary fam-
ily. An ordinary family says: You know 
what, I lost my job because of the eco-
nomic collapse. We have an economic 
collapse because of the failure to ad-
dress coronavirus, and now you are 
telling me it is good for me if I lose my 
electricity and my water while I try to 
help my kids get through this year 
when they can’t attend class or school 
and they have to do it at home. But 
you are OK having my electricity 
turned off. 
That is hardly helping the families 
get through this. I must say, it rep-
resents an awareness that is so distant 
from the experience of ordinary Ameri-
cans as to confound the mind and real-
ly challenge the heart. 
My colleague notes that, my good-
ness, the utilities have expenses. Yes, 
which is exactly why I have proposed 
that we compensate those utilities for 
those expenses. So why don’t we have 
this bill on the floor, and then we can 
actually have the arguments and get 
the facts out about it? 
My colleague said: I have these argu-
ments—arguments I have just noted 
and disagree with, but at least we are 
having a debate, which is rare in this 
Chamber. So let’s have this bill on the 
floor, and let’s have everyone bring 
their experiences to bear, and let’s 
open it to amendment. 
My colleague noted that there are 
piecemeal items that the majority 
leader brought forward because there is 
an election in a couple of weeks. He 
didn’t say ‘‘because there is an election 
in a couple of weeks,’’ but that is why 
they were brought forward. That is my 
opinion. I would have been fine bring-
ing those to the floor if they were open 
to amendment, but, no, they were a po-
litical stunt. It is, here is our version 
we want to vote on so we can do a cam-
paign commercial, but we are not going 
to let there actually be a debate, a pos-
sible amendment. The Senate might 
actually legislate? We haven’t done 
that in years. Why would we start now? 
Because that is the vision of our Con-
stitution, that there actually be de-
bates on this floor; that we actually 
allow relevant amendments to have a 
majority vote and be considered so 
that the collective interaction of Mem-
bers can produce a better outcome for 
America. By voting on those amend-
ments, we can be accountable to the 
people of the United States of America. 
So bring back the bill and guarantee 
that it will get amendments by simple 
majority, and let’s have a real debate 
because we owe it to the American peo-
ple. 
Let’s bring the Heroes Act to the 
floor—the one that has been trapped 
for 5 months. Amend the hell out of it 
if you want, but at least you are taking 
votes to be accountable to the people of 
the United States of America. At least 
we are having a debate—a debate—in 
front of Americans about what works 
and what doesn’t. We need more of that 
in this Chamber. We need a bipartisan 
consensus that will restore the ability 
of Senators to amend. 
It is not that long ago that in this 
Chamber, amendments were common 
and blockades were rare. That was a 
functioning legislative body. That ben-
efits every single Member. I can’t tell 
you how many Members on both sides 
of the aisle say that we need to restore 
the vision of a functioning legislative 
body. 
I want to do amendments. Let’s re-
store that vision. Let’s work together 
to restore that vision for the better-
ment of this Chamber but certainly for 
the betterment of America. And one 
idea that should be considered is pro-
tecting Americans from having their 
utilities cut off until we are on the far 
side of this crisis. 
Thank you.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representa-
tive Office in the United States (TECRO)— 
MS–110 Recce Pod System 
TECRO has requested to buy six (6) MS–110 
Recce Pods; three (3) Transportable Ground 
Stations; one (1) Fixed Ground station; spare 
and repair parts; repair and return; site sur-
veys; integration and test equipment; system 
support and equipment; personnel training 
and training equipment; publications and 
technical documentation; U.S. Government 
and contractor engineering, technical, and 
logistical support services; and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The total estimated program cost is $367.2 
million. 
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. 
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96– 
8. 
This proposed sale serves U.S. national, 
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and to maintain 
a credible defensive capability. The proposed 
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political 
stability, military balance, economic and 
progress in the region. 
This proposed sale will improve the recipi-
ent’s capability to meet current and future 
threats by providing timely Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), ca-
pabilities for its security and defense. The 
enhanced capability is a deterrent to re-
gional threats and will strengthen the recipi-
ent’s self-defense. The recipient will have no 
difficulty absorbing these systems into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Collins 
Aerospace, Westford, MA. The purchaser 
typically requests offsets. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the recipient. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MS–110 is a Non-Program of Record 
electro-optic and infrared airborne recon-
naissance system with long range, day/night, 
multi-spectral sensor technology. The multi- 
spectral sensor lets the end user see color 
and better distinguish subtle features that 
traditional gray-scale imagery cannot. The 
pod can transmit imagery via a datalink to 
ground-stations for near-real time analysis 
and exploitation. 
2. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
UNCLASSIFIED. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
recipient can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the recipient.

This proposed sale serves U.S. national, 
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and to maintain 
a credible defensive capability. The proposed 
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political 
stability, military balance, economic and 
progress in the region. 
The recipient will use this capability as a 
deterrent 
to 
regional 
threats 
and 
to 
strengthen homeland defense. Acquisition of 
HIMARS will contribute to the recipient’s 
goal of updating its military capability 
while 
further 
enhancing 
interoperability 
with the United States and other allies. The 
recipient will have no difficulty absorbing 
these systems into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Missile and Fire Control, Grand Prai-
rie, TX. The purchaser typically requests off-
sets. Any offset agreement will be defined in 
negotiations between the purchaser and the 
contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of U.S. Government 
and U.S. contractor representatives in-coun-
try; seven (7) U.S. Government and thirteen 
(13) U.S contractor representatives for a pe-
riod of 1 month; two (2) U.S. Government and 
seven (7) U.S. contractor representatives for 
a period of two months; and five (5) U.S. con-
tractor representatives for a period of one 
year. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket 
System (HIMARS) is a C–130 transportable 
wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton Family 
of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. 
HIMARS is the modern Army-fielded version 
of the Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(MLRS) M270 launcher, and can fire all of the 
MLRS Family of Munitions (FOM) including 
Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical 
Missile System (ATACMS). Utilizing the 
MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can engage targets 
between 15 and 300 kilometers with GPS- 
aided precision accuracy. 
2. The M57 Army Tactical Missile System 
(ATACMS)—Unitary is a conventional, semi- 
ballistic missile that utilizes a 500-pound 
high explosive warhead. It has an effective 
range of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and 
has increased lethality and accuracy over 
previous versions of the AT ACMS due to a 
GPS/Precise Position System (PPS) aided 
navigation system. 
3. The International Field Artillery Tac-
tical Data System is the international ex-
port version of the Army’s Advanced Field 
Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). 
It provides networked and fully automated 
support for the planning, coordination, con-
trol, and execution of fires and effects such 
as mortars, field artillery, rockets and mis-
siles, and close air support. International 
versions are developed for each customer 
unique to the weapon and targeting systems 
in their inventory. 
4. The M1152A1 High Mobility Multipurpose 
Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) is a two-man 
wheeled vehicle primarily used for the trans-
port of personnel or as a shelter carrier. 
5. The M240B Machine Gun is a family of 
belt-fed gas-operated medium machine guns 
that chamber the 7.62x5l mm NATO car-
tridge. It has been used extensively by the 
U.S. Army in infantry companies and as a 
mounted weapon on ground vehicles. 
6. The highest level of information re-
quired to facilitate sale, training, operation, 
and maintenance of these systems is classi-
fied SECRET. 
7. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
8. A determination has been made that the 
recipient can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
9. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the recipient.

support. The total estimated program cost is 
$1.008 billion. 
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. 
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96– 
8. 
This proposed sale serves U.S. national, 
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and to maintain 
a credible defensive capability. The proposed 
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political 
stability, military balance, economic and 
progress in the region 
This proposed sale will improve the recipi-
ent’s capability to meet current and future 
threats as it provides all-weather, day and 
night, precision attack capabilities against 
both moving and stationary targets. The re-
cipient will be able to employ a highly reli-
able and effective system to increase their 
warfighting effectiveness as needed, which 
can counter or deter aggressions by dem-
onstrated precision against surface targets. 
This capability will easily integrate into ex-
isting force infrastructure as it will only im-
prove defense against opposing threats. The 
recipient will have no difficulty absorbing 
these systems into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be the Boeing 
Company, St. Louis, MO. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two (2) U.S. con-
tractor representatives to the recipient for a 
duration of 8 years to support technical re-
views, support, and oversight. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

1. The AGM–84H Standoff Land Attack 
Missile-Expanded Response (SLAM–ER) is a 
nonnuclear tactical weapon system cur-
rently in service in the U.S. Navy and three 
other foreign nations. SLAM–ER is a follow 
on to the SLAM missile that is no longer in 
production. It is a variant of the Harpoon 
missile that uses an Imaging Infrared (IIR) 
seeker, planar wings, and a penetrating war-
head. SLAM–ER is effective against a wide 
range of land-based targets and has a sec-
ondary anti-ship mission capability. The fol-
lowing components are being conveyed by 
the proposed sale and are essential to the 
ability of the SLAM–ER missile to selec-
tively engage hostile targets under a wide 
range of operations. tactical and environ-
mental conditions.

equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities.

TRIBUTE TO DEIRDRE WALLACE 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to my dear 
friend and colleague, Deirdre ‘‘Dee’’ 
Wallace, who retired this year after 36 
years of Federal service. A true civil 
servant, Dee served our country and its 
citizens with humility and empathy for 
decades. 
Since taking the vow to serve and 
protect our Nation as a soldier in the 
U.S. Army, Dee has never stopped 
fighting for the American people. After 
5 years of military service, Dee dedi-
cated her life to making government 
work for the people during decades of 
service with the Army National Guard 
and the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 
Never discouraged, Dee embodies the 
type of caring spirit and can-do atti-
tude that we should all strive to emu-
late. As my chief of staff at the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Dee 
worked tirelessly to bring awareness to 
servicemembers 
battling 
posttraumatic stress disorder and vet-
erans facing homelessness. 
In our time together, I learned that 
no stone will go unturned with Dee 
around. She will always find a way to 
care for America’s heroes. Her service 
to her community is remarkable and 
her story inspiring. I stand here today 
to applaud my dear friend and to honor 
her extraordinary work. 
Dee, I wish you the best of luck in re-
tirement and thank you for your serv-
ice.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER COHAN 
∑ Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today, on behalf of myself and my col-
league from Delaware, Senator CHRIS 
COONS, to pay tribute to Jennifer 
Cohan, secretary of the Delaware De-
partment of Transportation—DelDOT— 
who has been a tremendous leader and 
public servant in the State of Delaware 
for more than three decades. Jen has 
served as the secretary of the DelDOT, 
since 2015 where, as the third woman to 
serve as secretary in the department’s 
100-year history, she developed and im-
plemented the State’s largest ever 
roadway infrastructure program. She 
previously served as director of the 
Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles— 
DMV—for 8 years and was the first 
woman to serve in that position in 
State history. 
After 31 years of public service to the 
State of Delaware, Jen is retiring from 
DelDOT at the end of this month. She 
will be taking on a new role as the 
chief executive officer of Leadership 
Delaware. In this new role, Jen will 
lead this highly regarded organization 
in its mission to recruit outstanding 
young Delawareans and help equip 
them with the knowledge, vision, in-
tegrity, and connections they will need 
to become the future leaders of com-
munities, nonprofits, businesses, and 
organizations within the First State. 
As secretary of DelDOT, Jen contrib-
uted not only her intellect, innovative 
ideas, and immense technical capacity, 
but also an uplifting positive energy 
that 
motivated 
everyone 
fortunate 
enough to serve on her team. 
Over the course of her distinguished 
career with the State of Delaware, Jen 
has held a range of leadership roles. In 
addition to her leadership of DelDOT, 
Jen is currently the chair of the Intel-
ligent Transportation Society of Amer-
ica, 
where 
she 
has 
highlighted 
DelDOT’s work to prepare Delaware’s 
transportation system for the future. 
Previously, in her capacity as director 
of the Delaware DMV, she transformed 
the agency by investing in technology 
and enhancing customer service. She 
also previously managed Delaware’s 
clean water program at the Delaware 
Department of Natural Resources and 
Environmental Control and analyzed 
budgets for the General Assembly in 
the office of the controller general. As 
if that were not enough, Jen has also 
spent the last 12 years as an adjunct 
professor at Wilmington University, 
teaching leadership and public policy 
in the master’s program there. 
On this occasion of your retirement 
from 
public 
service, 
Jen, 
Senator 
COONS and I want to convey to you the 
gratitude of all Delawareans for the en-
thusiasm, dedication, and entrepre-
neurial spirit that you have consist-
ently brought to your many leadership 
roles and for your service to the people 
of Delaware. We also want to extend 
our heartfelt thanks to your family for 
sharing you with all of us for the past 
31 years. In closing, Jen, please accept 
our warmest congratulations and best 
wishes and our thanks for dedicating 
the past three decades of your life to 
advancing mobility, improving infra-
structure, and enhancing the quality of 
life for all of us who call the First 
State home. Bravo Zulu. God bless.∑

Medicare coverage of COVID–19 vac-
cines without any cost-sharing; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
pleased to introduce the Ensuring Ac-
cess to COVID–19 Vaccines for Seniors 
Act with Senator SHELLEY MOORE CAP-
ITO of West Virginia. It is critical that 
a future COVID–19 vaccine be made 
available 
to 
Medicare 
beneficiaries 
with no cost sharing, which is the goal 
of our legislation. 
The CARES Act, which Congress 
passed overwhelmingly and was signed 
into law at the end of March, included 
provisions requiring Medicare to cover 
FDA-approved COVID–19 vaccines with 
no-cost sharing. These provisions are 
designed to ensure that as soon as 
there is an approved and available 
COVID–19 vaccine, seniors across the 
Nation would be able to get the vaccine 
for free under Medicare. Vaccines are 
one of the best public health interven-
tions in our lifetime and we must do 
everything we can to encourage every-
one to get the vaccines recommended 
by their doctors. One of the most effec-
tive ways to improve vaccination rates 
is to remove barriers such as cost. In 
fact, working with my colleagues, I 
was able to include provisions in the 
Affordable Care Act to ensure that vac-
cines are covered by insurance with no 
cost-sharing. This not only makes our 
population healthier, but it also saves 
money in the long-term. 
While the COVID–19 vaccine develop-
ment and testing protocols are ongo-
ing, it is very likely that the first vac-
cines will be made available under an 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) 
by FDA. An EUA may be granted to 
one or more COVID–19 vaccines in 
order to get vaccines to those who need 
them the most, while the pharma-
ceutical companies continue testing 
and evaluating vaccine candidates and 
pursuing full FDA approval. While I 
have concerns that the Trump Admin-
istration may attempt to interfere in 
the vaccine approval process, most 
public health experts believe that the 
first vaccine candidates will be made 
available under an EUA. In this case, 
the CARES Act provisions requiring 
Medicare to cover COVID–19 vaccines 
would not apply, as vaccines made 
available under an EUA would not yet 
be considered FDA-approved. Our bi-
partisan legislation would address this 
oversight and ensure that COVID–19 
vaccines would also be covered by 
Medicare if made available by an EUA. 
I am pleased that the House of Rep-
resentatives has already passed this 
provision as a part of the much broader 
Heroes Act. It is my hope that the Sen-
ate will follow suit immediately. It has 
been more than six months since the 
CARES Act was signed into law, and 
the need to provide additional relief to 
combat the health and economic im-
pacts of the COVID–19 pandemic has 
only increased. We are far overdue for 
another robust relief package, and it is 
shameful that the Senate has not yet 
acted to pass such a measure. It is crit-
ical that the Ensuring Access to 
COVID–19 Vaccines for Seniors Act be 
considered swiftly in the Senate, along 
with a number of other critical efforts 
to help the American people during 
this difficult time. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. 
CASEY, and Ms. BALDWIN): 
S. 4831. A bill to provide resources for 
States, State educational agencies, 
local educational agencies, educators, 
school leaders, and others to measure 
and address instructional loss in stu-
dents in kindergarten through grade 12; 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, recently 
Hawaii public schools resumed classes 
for the start of the 2020–2021 school 
year. 
Faced with the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic, our schools had planned to 
combine in-person, distance, and blend-
ed learning this year. Unfortunately, a 
sudden increase in coronavirus cases 
required a shift to fully distance learn-
ing through the first quarter. Now 
schools are navigating distance learn-
ing as they determine how they will re-
turn to the classroom. 
The pandemic has made it difficult to 
plan, and our principals, teachers, par-
ents, and students are doing the best 
they can. Many are still recovering 
from 
earlier 
this 
year, 
when 
the 
coronavirus closed campuses for two 
months—resulting in 46 fewer days in 
the classroom for students, who almost 
certainly experienced learning or in-
structional loss. 
I have heard from parents and stu-
dents, and they have been effusive in 
their praise for educators who are mak-
ing this school year work. I have also 
heard from educators, who have been 
clear in their need for more training 
and 
resources—especially 
when 
it 
comes to learning new strategies for 
providing effective distance learning 
and addressing instructional loss in 
students. Many educators are con-
cerned about how the pandemic will 
disproportionately impact at-risk and 
marginalized students. In Hawaii, edu-
cators are concerned about how it will 
impact Native Hawaiian and Pacific Is-
lander students, who before the pan-
demic already experienced achieve-
ment gaps in reading, math, and 
science, 
and 
graduated 
from 
high 
school and attended college at lower 
rates than their peers. These are not 
new challenges that we need to ad-
dress, but they could certainly be made 
worse by the pandemic unless we pro-
vide the appropriate resources. 
Until a vaccine is widely available, 
we must make decisions based on the 
best science and public health informa-
tion we can get in order to keep fami-
lies, teachers, and school support staff 
safe. For many school districts around 
the nation, distance learning will be a 
key component of our education sys-
tem, and we owe it to our students to 
do it right. For these reasons I am in-
troducing the Learning Opportunity 
and Achievement Act, or ‘‘LOAA’’, 
which would provide professional de-
velopment and training resources for 
educators, tutoring and academic serv-
ices for students, and resources for in-
novation grants, learning hubs, and re-
search and best practices related to in-
structional 
loss 
in 
at-risk 
and 
marginalized students. 
No 
one 
anticipated 
how 
the 
coronavirus would change our schools, 
as the abrupt shift to distance learning 
this past spring showed. Our educators 
need additional professional develop-
ment and training resources so that 
they can provide the most effective 
educational experience to students of 
all ages and backgrounds. 
LOAA 
provides 
these 
resources 
through new and existing programs. 
Specifically, the bill provides $2.25 bil-
lion for ESSA Title II–A programs, $50 
million for new professional develop-
ment programs, and $100 million for 
new training programs. 
Building on what we know about ef-
fective professional development, the 
bill promotes programs that are evi-
denced-based, collaborative, job-embed-
ded, 
content-based, 
and 
sustained. 
These kinds of programs will be helpful 
for educators. 
We do not know the full impact the 
coronavirus will have on schools, but 
preliminary estimates have indicated 
that recent closures could result in se-
vere setbacks for students—including, 
on average, 7 months of instructional 
loss for all students, 10.3 months for 
Black students, 9.2 months for Hispanic 
students, and more than a year for low- 
income students. LOAA provides $50 
million for new tutoring programs to 
address instructional loss in at-risk 
and marginalized students. 
The bill also includes funding for in-
novation grants and learning hubs to 
give public schools the resources they 
need to provide effective, equitable dis-
tance learning opportunities to all stu-
dents. These resources will allow dif-
ferent school districts to take different 
approaches based on their local needs 
and circumstances, while offering op-
portunities for at-risk and low-income 
families who cannot afford to create 
privately tutored ‘‘pods’’ to ensure 
that their children don’t fall further 
behind. 
And finally, the bill includes require-
ments for the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation to identify and disseminate best 
practices for schools to address in-
structional loss. It also requires the 
Department to study instructional loss 
in at-risk and marginalized students. 
Let me be clear. K–12 schools need 
additional support during this difficult 
time. Senate Democrats are fighting to 
provide this support, including at least 
$175 billion for K–12 schools, and will 
continue to do so. But we can go even 
further to make sure our educators 
have the resources they need to help 
students succeed—not only during the 
2020–2021 school year, but also in future 
years. LOAA would help to provide 
these resources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6380 
October 21, 2020 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this important bill. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
SANDERS, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. 
BOOKER): 
S. 4837. A bill to repeal the Alien En-
emies Act, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Neighbors Not 
Enemies Act. This long overdue legis-
lation would repeal the Alien Enemies 
Act, one of four laws from 1798 that 
were collectively known as the Alien 
and Sedition Acts. These controversial 
laws were enacted during a period of 
threatened war and were an attempt to 
severely limit freedom of speech and 
press and the rights of noncitizen resi-
dents. Of the four laws, only the Alien 
Enemies Act remains in effect. The 
Alien Enemies Act allows the Presi-
dent 
of 
the 
United 
States 
to 
‘‘apprehend[ ], restrain[ ], secure[ ] and 
remove[ ],’’ noncitizens without due 
process during times of war. 
In 1941, President Roosevelt used the 
authority of the Alien Enemies Act to 
apprehend ‘‘alien enemies deemed dan-
gerous to the public health or safety of 
the United States by the Attorney Gen-
eral or Secretary of War.’’ These ac-
tions allowed for the detention of Japa-
nese, Italian, and Germans as well as 
confiscation of their property. Then in 
1942, Roosevelt expanded on his actions 
by issuing Executive Order 9066, which 
authorized the mass removal and incar-
ceration of 120,000 Japanese Americans, 
both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, dur-
ing World War II. The internment of 
Japanese Americans was a shameful 
act, and it was not until 1988 that the 
Civil Liberties Act was passed, for-
mally apologizing to Americans of Jap-
anese ancestry and providing repara-
tions of $20,000 to each surviving victim 
who was incarcerated during World 
War II. 
During the 2016 election, Donald 
Trump invoked President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt’s application of the Alien 
Enemies Act during World War II when 
he called for a temporary ban on Mus-
lims entering the United States. Since 
taking office, President Trump has 
continued to advance divisive policies 
and hateful rhetoric that target and 
demonize Muslim and other minority 
communities. The President’s cruel 
anti-immigrant policies have resulted 
in the separation of children at the 
border, detention of families with no 
end in sight, and many more harmful 
policies that betray the principles and 
values on which our Nation was built 
upon. 
The President has brought the need 
to repeal the Alien Enemies Act to the 
forefront. We must stop his attempts 
to divide us through intolerance and 
fear. We must prevent civil and human 
rights travesties from happening on 
U.S. soil again. Sadly, we cannot trust 
the President. The Neighbors Not En-
emies Act would help keep our Nation 
from repeating history in targeting an 
entire group of noncitizens for uncon-
stitutional and discriminatory arrest, 
detention, and deportation. The repeal 
of the Alien Enemies Act is long over-
due, and I call on my colleagues in the 
United States Senate to swiftly pass 
the Neighbors Not Enemies Act during 
the 116th Congress. 
I yield the floor.

SEP-
TEMBER 27, 2020, THROUGH OCTO-
BER 3, 2020, AS ‘‘RELIGIOUS EDU-
CATION WEEK’’ TO CELEBRATE 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mr. 
GRAHAM 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
CRAMER, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. CASSIDY, 
Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. SCOTT of South Caro-
lina, Mr. BRAUN, and Mr. DAINES) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 750 
Whereas the free exercise of religion is an 
inherent, fundamental, and inalienable right 
protected by the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the United States has long recog-
nized that the free exercise of religion is im-
portant to the intellectual, ethical, moral, 
and civic development of individuals in the 
United States, as evidenced by founders of 
the United States, such as— 
(1) Benjamin Franklin, who believed reli-
gion to be ‘‘uniquely capable of educating a 
citizenry for democracy’’; and 
(2) George Washington, who said in his 
farewell address, ‘‘Of all the dispositions and 
habits which lead to political prosperity, re-
ligion and morality are indispensable sup-
ports.’’; 
Whereas religious education is useful for 
self-development, because it asks students to 
consider and respond to questions concerning 
the meaning and purpose of life, engages stu-
dents in questions about morality and jus-
tice, and enables students to identify their 
values; 
Whereas studies like the one published by 
the International Journal of Mental Health 
Systems in 2019 have shown that religious 
education can be ‘‘instrumental to improv-
ing adolescent mental health’’ by helping 
children learn how to make decisions based 
on morals, promoting less risky choices, and 
encouraging connectedness within a commu-
nity, which can enhance self-esteem and 
well-being; 
Whereas religious education fosters respect 
for other religious groups and individuals 
generally by acknowledging a source for 
human dignity and worth; 
Whereas the United States Supreme Court 
found in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 
510 (1925) that the state does not have power 
‘‘to standardize its children by forcing them 
to accept instruction from public teachers 
only. The child is not the mere creature of 
the state; those who nurture him and direct 
his destiny have the right, coupled with the 
high duty, to recognize and prepare him for 
additional obligations.’’; 
Whereas religious instruction can come 
from a variety of sources, including sec-
tarian schools and released time programs; 
Whereas, according to the National Center 
for Education Statistics, in 2015, 4,350,000 
children in the United States attended sec-
tarian elementary and secondary schools 
where those children received religious edu-
cation; and 
Whereas the United States Supreme Court 
held in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952) 
that State statutes providing for the release 
of public school students from school to at-
tend religious classes are constitutional, 
and, as a result, an estimated 540,000 public 
school students in the United States take ad-
vantage of released time programs each 
year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms the importance of religious edu-
cation in the civic and moral development of 
the people of the United States; 
(2) celebrates the schools and organizations 
that are engaged in religious instruction of 
the children of the United States to aid 
those children in intellectual, ethical, moral, 
and civic development; 
(3) calls on each of the 50 States, each ter-
ritory, and the District of Columbia to ac-
commodate individuals who wish to be re-
leased from public school attendance to at-
tend religious classes; and 
(4) designates the week of September 27, 
2020, through October 3, 2020, as ‘‘Religious 
Education Week’’.
