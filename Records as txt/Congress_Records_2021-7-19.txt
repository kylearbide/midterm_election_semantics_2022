PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, bless these next weeks 
that lie ahead of us. In this time when 
resources are highly contested and the 
premise on which decisions are made 
are highly charged, grant us Your infi-
nite wisdom and careful guidance. 
Give us Your vision that we would 
keep our eyes straight ahead, our gaze 
fixed before us, that our priority would 
be what You would have us see: Your 
perfect will for us and for this country. 
Then 
enable 
us 
to 
give 
careful 
thought to the paths our feet must 
take, that our steps would be firmly 
planted in Your truth. 
Protect us from being derailed by 
foolish impulse or fall wayward from 
our misjudgment. 
But cause us to be steadfast in our 
ways, that we would align with Your 
will, 
and 
our 
certainty 
would 
be 
grounded in faithfulness to You. 
Lord, our sight, our walk, our ac-
tions, and decisions are so easily influ-
enced by whim and worry. May this 
day, we remain committed to You. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON) come forward and 
lead the House in the Pledge of Alle-
giance. 
Ms. NORTON led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
D.C. IS MORE THAN READY FOR 
STATEHOOD 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to 
report significant progress on D.C. 
statehood and to thank my colleagues 
for passing my bill to make the Dis-
trict the 51st State. I especially thank 
Senator GARY PETERS for holding a 
Senate hearing on the bill in June, 
only the second hearing in Senate his-
tory. 
I particularly appreciate the work of 
Senator TOM CARPER, the lead Senate 
sponsor, for a record 45 Senate cospon-
sors. 
These efforts in the House and Sen-
ate have resulted in 54 percent of the 
American people now supporting D.C. 
statehood. 
D.C. is more than ready—indeed is 
overqualified—for statehood. Residents 
pay more Federal taxes per capita than 
any State, more taxes than 21 States, 
and has a larger gross domestic prod-
uct than 17 States. 
The District of Columbia is well on 
its way to becoming our 51st State. 
f 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND 
FAMILIES ARE AT RISK 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, at the grocery store and at 
the gas pump American families are 
facing a harsh new reality. Rising 
prices have effectively created both a 
tax hike and a pay cut for our workers. 
At the height of summer, families are 
now paying 3 percent more for fruits 
and vegetables, 9 percent more for 
milk, and 18 percent more for bacon. 
Instead of addressing this crisis, 
President Biden and liberals in Con-
gress are doing what they always do, 
spending money that we don’t have and 
asking taxpayers to cover the dif-
ference. 
Another $3.5 trillion spending bill is 
not what our country needs. 
Passing the Green New Deal under 
another name will not help American 
families. 
In Pennsylvania, inflation has harsh 
consequences on our local businesses 
like Guy Chemical in Somerset County 
who has seen a 30 to 50 percent rise in 
costs. 
Let’s 
make 
it 
clear: 
President 
Biden’s failed policies are putting 
American businesses and American 
families at risk.

July 19, 2021 
RECOGNIZING FORMER FIRST 
LADY MICHELLE OBAMA 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the important work 
being done by our former First Lady, 
Michelle Obama, through her Pass the 
Love campaign. 
In collaboration with the Partnership 
for a Healthier America, Mrs. Obama 
has been on a mission to distribute one 
million healthy meals to families in 
need. 
Last week, we learned that Philadel-
phia, part of my district, has been se-
lected as the next city for this cam-
paign. 
Pass 
the 
Love 
will 
work 
with 
Philabundance—a local leader in hun-
ger 
alleviation—to 
deliver 
healthy 
meal kits to 5,000 families. Over the 
course of 4 weeks, they will provide 
240,000 meals to families experiencing 
food insecurity. 
Children in Philadelphia and across 
America are hungry. 
Creative initiatives like this one 
from the former First Lady should be 
lauded for what they do, but they can-
not solve this systemic issue on their 
own. 
Our country has every resource re-
quired to eradicate hunger. We can and 
must make the decision to end hunger 
in America now.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-
dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

ENERGY EMERGENCY LEADERSHIP 
ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3119) to amend the Department of 
Energy Organization Act with respect 
to functions assigned to Assistant Sec-
retaries, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3119 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy 
Emergency Leadership Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO ASSISTANT 
SECRETARIES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (a) of section 
203 of the Department of Energy Organiza-
tion Act (42 U.S.C. 7133(a)) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new para-
graph: 
‘‘(12) Energy emergency and energy secu-
rity functions, including— 
‘‘(A) responsibilities with respect to infra-
structure, cybersecurity, emerging threats, 
supply, and emergency planning, coordina-
tion, response, and restoration; and 
‘‘(B) upon request of a State, local, or trib-
al government or energy sector entity, and 
in consultation with other Federal agencies 
as appropriate, provision of technical assist-
ance, support, and response capabilities with 
respect to energy security threats, risks, and 
incidents.’’. 
(b) COORDINATION.—The Secretary of En-
ergy shall ensure that the functions of the 
Secretary described in section 203(a)(12) of 
the Department of Energy Organization Act 
(as added by this Act) are performed in co-
ordination with relevant Federal agencies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3119. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3119, the Energy Emergency Leadership 
Act. This legislation and the two other 
energy bills that will follow it are bi-
partisan bills that will protect our en-
ergy grid from cyberattacks. All three 
of these bills passed the House last 
Congress but were never taken up in 
the Senate. That must change this 
year as the need for this legislation be-
comes more important by the day. 
We have heard repeatedly from secu-
rity experts and regulators over the 
last few years that our energy infra-
structure and grid are being attacked 
by state actors or other entities. In-
deed, just 2 months ago, large parts of 
this country suffered from gas short-
ages after a ransomware attack on the 
Colonial Pipeline. 
Former Energy Secretary Perry took 
the first step toward addressing the in-
creasing risk of cyberattacks on our 
energy infrastructure by creating the 
Cybersecurity and Energy Security 
Emergency Response office, or CESER, 
as it is pronounced. He then enhanced 
its stature by making its leader an as-
sistant secretary. 
So H.R. 3119 would amend section 
203(a) of the Department of Energy Or-
ganization Act by establishing in stat-
ute the new assistant secretary posi-
tion responsible for cybersecurity and 
emergency response issues. 
This bill also makes clear that this 
assistant secretary would have juris-
diction over all energy emergency and 
security functions related to energy 
supply, infrastructure, and cybersecu-
rity. 
It also vests the assistant secretary 
with the authority to provide DOE 
technical assistance and support to 
State, local, or Tribal governments 
upon request. 
And it requires the assistant sec-
retary and the Department of Energy 
to coordinate with the Department of 
Homeland Security and other relevant 
Federal agencies in carrying out the 
bill’s provisions. CESER performed this 
role admirably in May when it coordi-
nated 
the 
whole-of-government 
re-
sponse to the Colonial Pipeline attack. 
By codifying an assistant secretary 
for cybersecurity and emergency re-
sponse issues, this bill would go a long 
way in helping to protect the Nation’s 
electric infrastructure from hackers 
and other bad actors who would at-
tempt to disrupt our energy grid and 
harm our economy, our daily lives, and 
our overall national security. It would 
also appropriately raise the stature of 
the CESER office and provide more ac-
countability over the vital functions 
with a lead person tasked with car-
rying them out. 
I commend Energy Subcommittee 
Chairman BOBBY RUSH and Representa-
tive WALBERG for their bipartisan ef-
fort to protect our energy infrastruc-
ture. This bipartisan cooperation is es-
sential as we continue to work to de-
fend our country from the threat of 
cyberattacks. I also thank Ranking 
Member RODGERS
and Energy Sub-
committee Ranking Member UPTON for 
working with us to move this bill and 
the other two cybersecurity bills that 
will follow. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3119, the Energy Emergency Leadership 
Act. 
This bill, sponsored by Representa-
tives RUSH and WALBERG, has strong bi-
partisan support, and passed on suspen-
sion last Congress. 
The bill is necessary to strengthen 
the Department of Energy’s important 
energy emergency mission. 
It does so by requiring that the well- 
established energy emergency and cy-
bersecurity functions at DOE are orga-
nized under the leadership of an assist-
ant secretary confirmed by the Senate. 
Three-and-one-half years ago, Sec-
retary of Energy Perry recognized the 
importance of elevating this position 
within the Department. 
He 
established 
an 
assistant 
sec-
retary-led office, the Office of Cyberse-
curity, Energy Security, and Emer-
gency 
Response, 
which 
proved 
its 
worth in various situations over the 
past 2 years, including assistance relat-
ing to hurricanes and the recent Colo-
nial Pipeline ransomware attack. 
This bill amends the Department of 
Energy Organization Act to establish 
in law this assistant secretary level of 
leadership of DOE’s emergency re-
sponse and cybersecurity functions. 
This bill will ensure the Department 
has the focused and accountable leader-
ship to protect the public more fully

from fuel and electricity supply disrup-
tions against all hazards, natural or 
man-made, including emerging threats 
from our foreign adversaries to the Na-
tion’s electric grid. 
The bill has been drafted to ensure 
the Department carries out its respon-
sibility in coordination with other 
agencies by improving coordination 
across the Department; ensuring more 
effective interagency collaborations; 
and increasing accountability to Con-
gress. 
Establishing accountable leadership 
of this DOE mission is an important 
step in the face of increased threats, 
vulnerabilities, and interdependencies 
of energy infrastructure and end-use 
systems. 
Protecting energy security requires 
defense in depth. 
This means a strong energy sector, 
strong state capabilities, and ensuring 
sector agencies, like the Department of 
Energy, have the tools and accountable 
leadership they need to respond to en-
ergy emergencies. 
A vote for H.R. 3119 is a vote for en-
suring 
accountable 
DOE 
leadership 
over energy emergencies for the benefit 
of public safety and welfare and for 
stronger cybersecurity protections and 
energy systems. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG), one of the coleads 
on this legislation. 
b 1415 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding and allow-
ing me the opportunity to speak. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3119, 
the Energy Emergency Leadership Act. 
I thank my good friend from Illinois, 
Mr. BOBBY
RUSH, for continuing to 
work with me to get this bill across the 
finish line. 
This is the third Congress in a row 
that we have introduced this bill, each 
time passing the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce with unanimous, bipar-
tisan support. 
And frankly, given what we have 
seen just over the last few months in 
disruptions to our energy supply—in-
cluding the Colonial Pipeline attack— 
it is well past due for this important 
energy security measure to be enacted 
in law. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s economy 
and the health and safety of the Amer-
ican public depend upon the reliable 
and uninterrupted supply of fuels and 
electricity. 
Hazards of all forms—including nat-
ural 
disasters, 
digital, 
and 
cyberattacks—are 
no 
longer 
just 
threats. They are occurring at an 
alarming and continuing rate. 
Whether it is power outages in Texas 
and California due to weather events, 
or foreign adversaries hacking into our 
pipelines or grid, it is critical that we 
better equip our Federal agencies to 
prevent and respond to attacks in a 
way that fully protects the public. 
Presidential administrations of both 
parties have recognized this by pro-
viding the Department of Energy with 
the 
responsibilities, 
expertise, 
and 
tools to ensure the reliable supply of 
energy. 
It is time Congress does its part by 
requiring the energy emergency and 
cybersecurity functions at DOE to be 
organized under the leadership of an 
assistant secretary confirmed by the 
Senate. This will ensure the Depart-
ment has focused and accountable lead-
ership 
with 
high-level 
continuity 
throughout future administrations. 
H.R. 3119 will encourage more effec-
tive and seamless information-sharing 
with Federal and industry stakeholders 
on energy security threats, risks, and 
incidents, as well as recovery and re-
sponse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of H.R. 3119 in order to 
protect our Nation’s electric infra-
structure from foreign adversaries who 
are attempting to disrupt our energy 
system and cause untold harm to our 
economy, our daily lives, and our na-
tional security. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Rep-
resentative WALBERG and Representa-
tive BOBBY RUSH for their work on this 
very important legislation because, 
again, it is going to ensure that the De-
partment of Energy has the focus and 
the accountable leadership to more 
fully protect the public from any elec-
tricity fuel supply disruptions against 
all hazards—natural or manmade—in-
cluding emerging threats from our for-
eign adversaries to our Nation’s elec-
tric grid. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
both sides of the aisle, Mr. LATTA and 
others, for their help in getting this 
bill moved. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I would ask sup-
port for the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3119. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2931. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking my 
colleagues on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce, Representative 
MCNERNEY of California and Represent-
ative LATTA of Ohio, for their contin-
ued work and cooperation on energy se-
curity issues and for introducing H.R. 
2931, the Enhancing Grid Security 
Through Public-Private Partnerships 
Act. 
This legislation could not be more 
necessary. Our Nation is facing an in-
creasing number of physical and cyber 
threats to its electric grid and infra-
structure. This bill addresses those 
threats by directing the Secretary of 
Energy, in consultation with the Elec-
tric Reliability Organization, States, 
other Federal agencies, and industry 
stakeholders, to create and implement 
a program to enhance the physical and 
cybersecurity of electric utilities. 
It calls for cybersecurity training to 
mitigate supply chain risks and im-
proving the cybersecurity of third- 
party utility vendors. It also encour-
ages utilities to share best practices 
and data within the electric sector. 
The bill requires the Secretary of En-
ergy to deliver a report to Congress on 
general cybersecurity concerns and to 
coordinate with the Department of 
Homeland Security and other relevant 
agencies to ensure good communica-
tions and smooth implementation of 
this program across the government. 
Finally, the bill instructs the Sec-
retary of Energy to update the Inter-
ruption 
Cost 
Estimate 
Calculator, 
which is an electric reliability plan-
ning tool for estimating electricity 
interruption costs and the benefits as-
sociated with reliability benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2931 is an impor-
tant bipartisan bill that will help ad-
dress the security of our Nation’s elec-
tric utilities, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2931, the first of two grid secu-
rity bills I have worked closely on with 
my good friend and colleague, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCNER-
NEY) over the last several Congresses. 
The goal of these two bills is to im-
prove the resiliency of our Nation’s en-
ergy grid against cyberattacks. Since 
the House last considered these bills on 
the floor, our country has experienced 
a new wave of cyberattacks on our crit-
ical infrastructure. 
On December 13, 2020, the cybersecu-
rity firm, FireEye, published research 
that a malicious actor was exploiting a 
supply 
chain 
vulnerability 
in 
SolarWinds products to hack into gov-
ernment and private sector informa-
tion technology networks. 
On May 8 of this year, the Colonial 
Pipeline Company announced that it 
was forced to halt its pipeline oper-
ation due to a ransomware attack, 
which disrupted critical supplies of 
gasoline and other refined products 
throughout the Southeast and the East 
Coast. 
Cyberattacks on our critical infra-
structure will only continue to grow in 
both size and severity and Congress 
must take a stand. H.R. 2931, the En-
hancing Grid Security Through Public- 
Private Partnerships Act, will facili-
tate and encourage public-private part-
nerships in order to improve the cyber-
security of electric utilities. 
Specifically, it would develop and 
provide for voluntary implementation 
of maturity models, self-assessments, 
and auditing methods for assessing the 
physical security and cybersecurity of 
electric utilities. 
H.R. 2931 would provide training and 
technical assistance to electric utili-
ties to address and mitigate cybersecu-
rity supply chain management risks 
and increase opportunities for sharing 
best practices and data collection with-
in the electric sector. 
Finally, this legislation will require 
the Secretary of Energy to submit a re-
port to Congress that assesses prior-
ities, policies, procedures, actions, and 
implementations 
of 
electricity 
dis-
tribution systems to address threats to 
and vulnerabilities of such electricity 
distribution systems. We cannot allow 
criminal cyber behavior to go unchal-
lenged. Both H.R. 2931 and H.R. 2928 
will help in the fight against cyber at-
tacks. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE, Chairman RUSH, leaders RODGERS 
and UPTON for their efforts to advance 
these bills, and I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on final passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY), the Democratic sponsor. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my legislation, H.R. 2931, the En-
hancing Grid Security Through Public- 
Private Partnership Act. The prior bill, 
this bill, and the next bill are good ex-
amples of working together on a bipar-
tisan basis to accomplish things that 
are very critical to this country, and I 
thank my colleagues for being a very 
important part of this partnership. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we 
are considering this bill today, because 
we simply can’t afford to wait any 
longer to secure our Nation’s critical 
infrastructure, including the grid. The 
Colonial Pipeline attack coming on the 
heels of the SolarWinds attack was a 
bright warning sign that we need to act 
quickly to pass this legislation. 
Since the Colonial Pipeline attack, 
ransomware attacks have continued to 
skyrocket, and the need to enact H.R. 
2931 has become even more pressing. 
H.R. 2931 would create a program to en-
hance the physical and cybersecurity 
of electric utilities. This program 
would develop methods for assessing 
security vulnerabilities. It would also 
provide cybersecurity training to elec-
tric utilities, advance cybersecurity of 
utility third-party vendors, and pro-
mote sharing of best practices and data 
collection in the electric sector. 
Under this legislation, the Secretary 
of Energy would work in consultation 
with States, Federal agencies, and in-
dustry stakeholders to create this pro-
gram. By encouraging these partner-
ships, we will better position ourselves 
to keep the Nation’s lights on and to

protect our grid from the growing 
cyber threats. 
Additionally, H.R. 2931 would require 
the Interruption Cost Estimate Calcu-
lator, which is used to calculate the 
ROI on utility investments, to be up-
dated at least every 2 years to ensure 
accurate calculations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend 
and partner in this legislation, Rep-
resentative LATTA from Ohio, for work-
ing with me on this important bill. I 
also thank Chairman PALLONE, Rank-
ing Member RODGERS, and the staff of 
the committee for helping us move this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, again, 
from the recent attacks that we have 
had across the country in the last year 
and a half, it shows the importance of 
making sure that we are protected on 
the cybersecurity front. And working 
with my good friend and colleague 
from California, it has been so impor-
tant that we get these two bills across 
the finish line today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members 
today to support H.R. 2931, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
also ask that all our colleagues would 
support this on a bipartisan basis, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2931. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CYBER SENSE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2928) to require the Secretary of 
Energy to establish a voluntary Cyber 
Sense program to test the cybersecu-
rity of products and technologies in-
tended for use in the bulk-power sys-
tem, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2928 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cyber Sense 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. CYBER SENSE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Energy, 
in coordination with relevant Federal agen-
cies, shall establish a voluntary Cyber Sense 
program to test the cybersecurity of prod-
ucts and technologies intended for use in the 
bulk-power system, as defined in section 
215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 
824o(a)). 
(b) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.—In carrying 
out subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy 
shall— 
(1) establish a testing process under the 
Cyber Sense program to test the cybersecu-
rity of products and technologies intended 
for use in the bulk-power system, including 
products relating to industrial control sys-
tems and operational technologies, such as 
supervisory control and data acquisition sys-
tems; 
(2) for products and technologies tested 
under the Cyber Sense program, establish 
and maintain cybersecurity vulnerability re-
porting processes and a related database; 
(3) provide technical assistance to electric 
utilities, product manufacturers, and other 
electricity sector stakeholders to develop so-
lutions to mitigate identified cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities in products and technologies 
tested under the Cyber Sense program; 
(4) biennially review products and tech-
nologies tested under the Cyber Sense pro-
gram for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and 
provide analysis with respect to how such 
products and technologies respond to and 
mitigate cyber threats; 
(5) develop guidance, that is informed by 
analysis and testing results under the Cyber 
Sense program, for electric utilities for pro-
curement of products and technologies; 
(6) provide reasonable notice to the public, 
and solicit comments from the public, prior 
to establishing or revising the testing proc-
ess under the Cyber Sense program; 
(7) oversee testing of products and tech-
nologies under the Cyber Sense program; and 
(8) consider incentives to encourage the 
use of analysis and results of testing under 
the Cyber Sense program in the design of 
products and technologies for use in the 
bulk-power system. 
(c) DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.—Any cy-
bersecurity vulnerability reported pursuant 
to a process established under subsection 
(b)(2), the disclosure of which the Secretary 
of Energy reasonably foresees would cause 
harm to critical electric infrastructure (as 
defined in section 215A of the Federal Power 
Act), shall be deemed to be critical electric 
infrastructure information for purposes of 
section 215A(d) of the Federal Power Act. 
(d) 
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
LIABILITY.— 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
authorize the commencement of an action 
against the United States Government with 
respect to the testing of a product or tech-
nology under the Cyber Sense program. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2928. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2928, the Cyber Sense Act of 2021. Grid 
security is a national security issue. 
Fortunately, there has not yet been a 
broad cyberattack that has taken down 
large parts of the electric grid in the 
United States. But as we learned from 
the ransomware attack on the Colonial 
Pipeline earlier this year, we must not 
let our guard down. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
H.R. 2928, which gives the electric sec-
tor critical tools and technologies nec-
essary to protect our grid from mali-
cious harm. 
This legislation gives the Depart-
ment of Energy an important new au-
thority to facilitate the adoption of 
more secure technologies and equip-
ment in our Nation’s grid. It does this 
by requiring the Department of Energy 
to set up a voluntary ‘‘Cyber Sense’’ 
program to identify cyber-secure prod-
ucts for use in the bulk-power system. 
The bill also requires the Secretary 
of Energy to coordinate with the De-
partment of Homeland Security and 
other relevant Federal agencies in 
order to ensure smooth and seamless 
implementation 
across 
the 
Federal 
Government. 
b 1430 
This program would also provide 
technical assistance to electric utili-
ties and product manufacturers to as-
sist them in developing solutions to 
mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in the 
grid. 
I want to again thank my colleagues, 
Representatives MCNERNEY and LATTA, 
for their hard work on this critical 
issue and for their persistence in pur-
suing this bill for the last several 
years. Their partnership and bipartisan 
leadership on cybersecurity issues con-
tinues to benefit us all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important bi-
partisan bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2928, the Cyber Sense Act, 
which is the second of two grid secu-
rity bills that I have introduced and, 
again, worked closely on with my good 
friend and colleague, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
This bipartisan legislation will estab-
lish a testing process under a newly es-
tablished voluntary Cyber Sense pro-
gram to test the cybersecurity of prod-
ucts and technologies intended for use 
in the bulk-power system, including 
products relating to industrial control 
systems and operational technologies, 
such as supervisory control and data 
acquisition systems. 
It would provide technical assistance 
to electric utilities, product manufac-
turers, and other electricity sector 
stakeholders to develop solutions to 
mitigate identified cybersecurity vul-
nerabilities 
in 
products 
and 
tech-
nologies tested under the Cyber Sense 
program. 
H.R. 2928 would also develop guidance 
for electric utilities for procurement of 
products and technologies and consider 
incentives to encourage the use of 
analysis and results of testing under 
the program in the design of products 
and technologies for use in the bulk- 
power system. 
The SolarWinds attack exposed a vul-
nerability in our supply chains that

should serve as a wake-up call to the 
energy sector. Similar attacks on prod-
ucts used in grid operators’ IT net-
works could go undetected and, when 
exposed, result in the costly process of 
disabling and removing such products 
from operation. 
Having a program that would allow 
for the testing of a product’s cyberse-
curity would help grid operators share 
information and maintain coordination 
with the Federal Government to keep 
pace 
with 
evolving 
cybersecurity 
threats. H.R. 2928 would accomplish 
these goals. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
PALLONE, Chairman RUSH, Leader ROD-
GERS, and Leader UPTON for their sup-
port. I call on my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY), the sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2928, the Cyber 
Sense Act of 2021. 
The Cyber Sense Act is another piece 
of bipartisan legislation that takes 
steps to improve the security of our 
Nation’s electric grid infrastructure. It 
would establish a program to identify 
cyber secure products for the bulk- 
power grid through a testing and verifi-
cation program. 
The bulk-power system is essential 
for providing reliable electric power to 
the American people. We must ensure 
that this system is as secure as pos-
sible. Any vulnerable component in our 
grid is a threat to our security, and 
this bill will take important steps to 
strengthen the system. 
It would also require the Department 
of Energy to provide technical assist-
ance to electric utilities, manufactur-
ers, and other relevant stakeholders re-
lated to cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
in products under the Cyber Sense pro-
gram. 
In today’s world, there are literally 
billions of connected devices in use and 
the number is rapidly increasing. Most 
of these devices have no standards. 
There is no way for electric utilities to 
verify the security of the products, and 
we are seeing cyber threats continue to 
increase. This legislation is badly need-
ed. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
Mr. LATTA, again for his partnership on 
this bill. We have been working to-
gether on a number of issues, and this 
is a sign of our partnership. 
I also thank Chairman PALLONE and 
Ranking Member RODGERS for working 
with us to move this legislation quick-
ly, and I don’t want to forget the staff 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, who have been so helpful. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers, and I am ready to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, again, as the gentleman 
from California mentioned about the 
ongoing cyberattacks we have had in 
this country, it is absolutely essential 
that we get this bill across the finish 
line. H.R. 2928 is going to help accom-
plish these goals and protect our grid 
out there. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues on both sides to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2928. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
EMERGENCY REPORTING ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1250) to direct the Federal Com-
munications Commission to issue re-
ports after activation of the Disaster 
Information Reporting System and to 
make improvements to network outage 
reporting. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1250. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1250, the Emergency Reporting 
Act. This is an important and timely 
piece of legislation as many of our 
Western States are currently experi-
encing devastating wildfires, and as we 
enter another Atlantic hurricane sea-
son, obviously, it is important in my 
area as well. 
We rely on our communication de-
vices every day, but it is critical that 
we have a signal or a connection during 
an emergency. In our world today, 
connectivity isn’t a luxury; it is essen-
tial to ensuring our collective safety. 
Often, it can be the difference between 
life and death. 
It is the responsibility of the Federal 
Communications Commission to ensure 
that Americans stay connected when it 
matters most and that communication 
providers are prepared for whatever 
disasters might come their way. So if 
we want to improve the reliability of 
the communication networks, we must 
begin with better data. 
The Disaster Information Reporting 
Systems, or DIRS, was launched by the 
FCC in 2007 so that the communication 
providers could report the status of 
communications systems during disas-
ters. 
In some cases, DIRS is activated in 
advance of a potential storm as a pre-
cautionary measure. In more extreme 
cases, DIRS is activated in the lead-up 
to a disaster and stays active for days 
on end. That is because networks can 
go on- and offline even after a storm’s 
end. 
Under this bill, the FCC would be re-
quired to conduct an analysis of any 
disaster or event for which DIRS is ac-
tivated by the FCC and stays active for 
a minimum of 7 days. 
First, the FCC would be required to 
issue a preliminary report within 6 
weeks after the date DIRS is deacti-
vated, and this report would include 
detailed information about the number 
of outages, whether communications 
infrastructure was affected, and how 
many 911 centers were affected by serv-
ice outages. 
The bill would then require the FCC 
to hold a field hearing not later than 8 
months after the Commission deacti-
vates DIRS. By making sure the FCC 
gets out of Washington and sees and 
hears real stories from the impacted 
areas, the FCC will get the opportunity 
to examine these events, the outages 
they cause, and how we can prevent 
them from happening in the future. 
I commend Representative MATSUI, a 
senior leader of our committee, for her 
leadership on this bill and her passion 
for improving communications resil-
iency and reliability. 
I also thank my Republican col-
leagues for working with us to move 
this bill through the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and out of the full 
House last Congress. This is a good bill 
that will help us make our communica-
tion systems more resilient in the fu-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the measure and look forward 
to its consideration by the Senate and 
the President, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1250, the Emergency Reporting 
Act, that was introduced by Represent-
atives 
MATSUI, 
BILIRAKIS, 
ESHOO, 
THOMPSON, and HUFFMAN. 
Today’s legislation will allow 911 cen-
ters across the country to have access 
to confidential information on poten-
tial 911 outages, subject to appropriate 
safeguards. 
In times of disaster, 911 public safety 
answering points do not always know 
that 911 calls may not be going 
through. The Federal Communications 
Commission, the FCC, currently col-
lects information on the status of com-
munications infrastructure and com-
munications network outage informa-
tion. They make that information 
available to the Department of Home-
land Security to coordinate overall 
emergency response efforts within a 
State between State and local first re-
sponders. 
Given the sensitive nature of this 
data to both national security and 
commercial competitiveness, this in-
formation is confidential. However, as 
first responders work to ensure the 911 
system can seamlessly get back online 
and route calls to the neighboring call 
centers, access to this confidential in-
formation is important. 
This bill would help make timely 
outage information available to help 
first responders on the ground restore 
service as quickly as possible. 
The bill also requires the FCC to hold 
a field hearing in areas in which the 
Commission’s Disaster Information Re-
porting System, DIRS, is activated for 
more than 7 days and to provide an ini-
tial and final report on the status of 
communication networks. 
The FCC only activates the DIRS 
system for significant natural disas-
ters, such as major hurricanes or 
wildfires, and the bill limits these 
types of reports to only areas where 
damage was significant and sustained. 
This is an important bill to the resil-
iency of public safety networks, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. I have no speakers, so 
the gentleman from Ohio may proceed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is, again, a 
very important piece of legislation 
that has come out of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. It is important 
to make sure that we do have that re-
siliency out there for our 911 system, 
which is so important to that person 
picking up that phone call but also who 
is receiving it on the other end. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to pass 
the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I again 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this important legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1250. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

MEASURING 
THE 
ECONOMICS 
DRIVING INVESTMENTS AND AC-
CESS FOR DIVERSITY ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1754) to amend the Communica-
tions Act of 1934 to require the Federal 
Communications Commission to con-
sider market entry barriers for socially 
disadvantaged individuals in the com-
munications marketplace report under 
section 13 of such Act. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1754 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Measuring 
the Economics Driving Investments and Ac-
cess for Diversity Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘MEDIA Diversity Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. CONSIDERING MARKET ENTRY BARRIERS 
FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED IN-
DIVIDUALS. 
Section 13(d) of the Communications Act of 
1934 (47 U.S.C. 163(d)) is amended by adding 
at the end the following: 
‘‘(4) CONSIDERING SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED 
INDIVIDUALS.—In assessing the state of com-
petition under subsection (b)(1) and regu-
latory barriers under subsection (b)(3), the 
Commission, with the input of the Office of 
Communications Business Opportunities of 
the Commission, shall consider market entry 
barriers for socially disadvantaged individ-
uals in the communications marketplace in 
accordance with the national policy under 
section 257(b).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1754. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1754, the Measuring the Eco-
nomics Driving Investments and Ac-
cess for Diversity Act of 2021, or the 
MEDIA Diversity Act of 2021. 
This bill promotes much-needed di-
versity in the communications market-
place. It does this by requiring the Fed-
eral 
Communications 
Commission, 
with the input of its Office of Commu-
nications Business Opportunities, to 
consider market entry barriers for so-
cially disadvantaged individuals in the 
communications marketplace. 
Currently, there are vast inequities 
in the communications marketplace. 
While women and people of color make 
up over 50 percent of our population, 
broadcast ownership by them is only 
about 10 percent. That is extremely 
concerning, Mr. Speaker, when you 
think that media outlets can influence 
people’s 
opinions 
and 
perceptions 
through the programming decisions 
that are made. 
Diversity in ownership of media out-
lets helps to ensure that programming 
offers different perspectives and that 
viewers have access to programming 
that is relevant to them. Experts have 
also found that ownership diversity can 
provide financial and competitive bene-
fits. But in a concentrated communica-
tions marketplace, barriers for entry 
still exist, and the Federal Commu-
nications 
Commission 
is 
already 
tasked with studying what those bar-
riers are. This bill asks the FCC to also 
consider market entry barriers for so-
cially disadvantaged individuals. 
Creating ownership parity to reflect 
this country’s diversity is a worthy 
goal, and this bipartisan effort is a step 
in identifying market entry barriers. 
To be clear, there is so much more 
that we need to do, Mr. Speaker. While 
incremental steps are critical, we must 
do more. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues to take additional 
steps to diversify our media market. 
I commend Representatives LONG and 
VEASEY for their bipartisan work on 
this legislation. I hope we can now 
come together in a bipartisan fashion 
to do the additional work that is need-
ed to finally eliminate the barriers so 
that the owners of our media outlets 
begin to look more like the commu-
nities that they serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support the MEDIA Diversity Act of 
2021, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1754, the MEDIA Diversity Act, 
introduced by my colleague from Mis-
souri, Representative LONG. This legis-
lation represents another step forward 
to uplift minority voices and promote 
diversity in the media marketplace. 
I understand how important it is to 
serve communities with local program-
ming that accurately reflects a com-
munity’s population. I have also seen 
the media industry make great strides 
to promote diversity and create new 
content to appeal to the communities 
they serve by establishing programs 
and initiatives to promote opportuni-
ties for women, minorities, veterans, 
elderly, and other socially disadvan-
taged individuals to participate in the 
media marketplace. 
Of course, the media industry is only 
one small part of a vast communica-
tions marketplace that encompasses a 
large variety of organizations, includ-
ing mobile wireless providers, online 
video distributors, fixed broadband pro-
viders, and so on. 
It is also important to keep in mind 
that there are new entrants in the tech 
industry who are providing additional 
opportunities for minorities, women, 
veterans, and underrepresented groups 
who might not have been heard before 
to make their voices heard. 
Nonetheless, there is still work to do 
to make sure that those previously un-
heard voices and underserved commu-
nities are represented in traditional 
media and all other areas of the large 
communications marketplace, and this 
legislation will help. 
I am glad to support this piece of bi-
partisan legislation that will allow the 
Federal Communications Commission 
to evaluate the market barriers so-
cially disadvantaged individuals face in 
the communications marketplace as a 
whole. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, again, I urge 
all Members to support this piece of 
legislation. It is very important. It was 
introduced by our colleague, Mr. LONG 
from Missouri. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1754. 
The question was taken.

REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT TO 
MEDIA DIVERSITY 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 277) reaffirming the 
commitment to media diversity and 
pledging to work with media entities 
and diverse stakeholders to develop 
common ground solutions to eliminate 
barriers to media diversity. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 277 
Whereas the principle that an informed 
and engaged electorate is critical to a vi-

range of viewpoints and the ability to con-
tribute to the political debate is central to 
sustaining that informed engagement; 
Whereas it is in the public interest to en-
courage source, content, and audience diver-
sity on our Nation’s shared telecommuni-
cations and media platforms; 
Whereas the survival 
of 
small, 
inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets that 
serve diverse audiences and local media mar-
kets is essential to preserving local culture 
and building understanding on important 
community issues that impact the daily 
lives of residents; 
Whereas research by the American Society 
of News Editors, the Radio Television Digital 
News Association, the Pew Research Center, 
and others has documented the continued 
challenges of increasing diversity among all 
types of media entities; 
Whereas with increasing media experience 
and sophistication, it is even more impor-
tant to have minority participation in local 
media to ensure a diverse range of informa-
tion sources are available and different ideas 
and viewpoints are expressed to strengthen 
social cohesion among different commu-
nities; and 
Whereas the constriction in small, inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets and lim-
ited participation of diverse populations in 
media ownership and decision making are 
combining to negatively impact our goal of 
increasing local civic engagement and civic 
knowledge through increased voter partici-
pation, membership in civic groups, and 
knowledge of local political and civil infor-
mation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity 
as a core tenet of the public interest stand-
ard in media policy; and 
(2) pledges to work with media entities and 
diverse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers to 
media diversity.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
277. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 277, reaffirming the commit-
ment to media diversity and pledging 
to work with media entities and di-
verse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers 
to media diversity. 
This resolution promotes much-need-
ed diversity in the communications 
marketplace where we continue to see 
vast inequities. For example, the own-
ers of broadcast and cable media out-
lets do not reflect our diverse popu-
lation. Owners of these media outlets 
make critical decisions about the edu-
cational, political, entertainment, and 
news programming Americans watch. 
These decisions can influence people’s 
opinions and perceptions. 
Mr. Speaker, diversity in viewpoints 
and diverse ownership of media outlets 
promotes programming that offers dif-
ferent perspectives and enables viewers 
to access programming that is relevant 
to them. A diverse media marketplace 
is also central to an informed and en-
gaged electorate which is essential to a 
vibrant democracy. 
Committing to a diverse media mar-
ketplace—one that reflects our Na-
tion—is a worthy goal, and this resolu-
tion reaffirms that goal. 
Today’s resolution is a good step for-
ward, but there is much more we need 
to do. The numbers and statistics are 
clear: our media marketplace does not 
resemble the people we serve. 
I want to commend Representative 
DEMINGS for her work on this resolu-
tion and for continuing to bring atten-
tion to not only the lack of diversity in 
our media outlets, but also the impact 
that it has on our communities and on 
our Nation. I hope we can come to-
gether to do the additional work that 
is needed to improve the state of diver-
sity today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this resolution, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 277, a resolution introduced 
by our colleague, Mrs. DEMINGS. 
This resolution reaffirms the com-
mitment by Congress to work with 
media 
entities 
and 
diverse 
stake-
holders to find common ground solu-
tions to eliminate barriers to expand-
ing diversity in our media. While to-
day’s resolution focuses specifically on 
broadcast stations, this problem is not 
unique to one segment of the industry, 
but to their cable and digital stream-
ing competitors in the marketplace as 
well. 
I appreciate the many steps that the 
broadcast and cable industries have 
taken to not only recognize these bar-
riers, but the many programs and ini-
tiatives they have put in place to pro-
mote opportunities for women, minori-
ties, 
and 
veterans. 
However, 
data 
shows we have some room for improve-
ment. 
While the House is considering this 
resolution today, it is my hope that we 
can work together in a bipartisan man-
ner to address the inequality that this 
resolution seeks to address. Repub-
licans on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee have put forward solutions 
to uplift minority voices and promote 
media diversity that can breathe life 
into this resolution before us today. 
Today, we are also considering H.R. 
1754, the MEDIA Diversity Act, spon-
sored by Mr. LONG, which would help us 
better understand the market and reg-
ulatory barriers for socially disadvan-
taged individuals to enter and compete 
in the marketplace so we can make in-
formed policy decisions. 
We have also worked with advocates 
and industry alike as we try and find 
consensus on legislation to establish 
the long-sought-after broadcast incu-
bator program to help increase the 
number of minority-owned broadcast 
stations. 
Last Congress, Republicans intro-
duced the Broadcast Diversity in Lead-
ership Act, which would incentivize 
large, established broadcasters to work 
with aspiring broadcasters to break 
down barriers to capital and provide 
mentorship and experience to new mi-
nority entrants to ensure their long-
standing success in serving their local 
communities. 
While the Supreme Court has re-
cently reinstated the Republican-led 
pilot program, Congress should con-
tinue working to ensure it is expanded 
and made permanent with improved 
safeguards. We urge the majority to 
continue working with us on these im-
portant issues. 
With the passage of this resolution, 
we are affirming our commitment to 
work toward common ground solu-
tions, and Republicans stand ready to 
work across the aisle to turn our com-
mon ground solutions into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS), who is the sponsor of the 
resolution. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for 
this opportunity. 
We all know the United States is a 
diverse nation with diverse people, di-
verse viewpoints, and diverse perspec-
tives. Every community in America— 
no matter their age, gender, ZIP Code, 
or income—should be allowed to tell 
their stories in their voices. 
Whether in news, movies, television, 
music, or more, it is important that 
our media represent the wonderful di-
versity of our great Nation. This reso-
lution simply states that all Americans 
should have the opportunity to tell 
their story and hear their story told 
through their own eyes and voices. 
I am glad that our resolution re-
affirming Congress’ support of media 
diversity will be voted on this after-
noon. As we work together to remove 
barriers, I am grateful to all of the con-
gressional cosponsors on both sides of 
the aisle and media representatives 
who helped move this bill forward. 
Every child in America should hear a 
voice that sounds like theirs and see a 
face that looks like theirs. As we face 
some of America’s greatest challenges, 
I am excited about the work still yet to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues again on both sides of the aisle 
for their support of this resolution. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
additional speakers.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 3003, the Promoting United 
States Wireless Leadership Act of 2021. 
This legislation will help ensure the 
U.S. continues to lead the world in ad-
vanced communications technologies 
and deployments. It does that by di-
recting the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administra-
tion, NTIA, to encourage participation 
by American stakeholders and stand-
ards-setting bodies, such as the Third 
Generation Partnership Project, better 
known as 3GPP, and the IEEE. 
The legislation also calls on the 
NTIA to offer technical assistance to 
U.S. stakeholders that do elect to par-
ticipate in developing standards for 5G 
networks and future generations of 
communication networks. 
Other governments around the world 
are engaged in the standards-setting 
process 
for 
advanced 
telecommuni-
cations technologies, and discussions 
about 6G are already underway. This 
legislation will give our stakeholders 
the ability to better engage in policy 
choices that are being made today by 
the standards-setting bodies. These 
policy choices will have far-reaching 
implications for the development of 5G 
and other advanced communication 
technologies in the future. 
By ensuring that globally developed 
standards meet the needs of the U.S. 
and our partners, this bill will help the 
U.S. continue to innovate. It will also 
help us guard against nontrusted ac-
tors hijacking standards-setting proc-
esses, which is an important compo-
nent of our continued engagement on 
future communications technologies. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend this 
bipartisan effort from Representatives 
WALBERG, 
DINGELL, 
JOHNSON, 
and 
KUSTER. I also want to thank our col-
leagues on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee and Chairman MEEKS, in par-
ticular, for working with us to bring 
this legislation to the floor. 
I hope we can come together on this 
important issue, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the bill. I reserve 
the balance of my time.

DEAR CHAIRMAN MEEKS: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 3003, the 
‘‘Promoting United States Wireless Leader-
ship Act of 2021’’, so that the bill may pro-

I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-

atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 3003 are 
entered into the Congressional Record dur-
ing floor consideration of the bill. I appre-
ciate your cooperation regarding this legis-
lation and look forward to continuing to 
work 
together 
as 
this 
measure 
moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
H.R. 3003, the Promoting United States 
Wireless Leadership Act. 
Our communications networks are a 
critically important asset for facili-
tating domestic and international com-
merce. For decades, the U.S. has led 
the development of wireless technology 
with like-minded nations. With the de-
ployment of the next-generation wire-
less technology 5G, which is expected 
to skyrocket in the coming years and 
months, we must continue to focus on 
bolstering the foundational elements 
to make sure the United States con-
tinues to lead on future technological 
advances. 
As these standards are set in global, 
industry-led standards bodies, we must 
enhance participation by U.S. compa-
nies and remain vigilant that bad ac-
tors don’t game the system for their 
own economic and national security in-
terests. 
To keep accountability and ensure 
proper transparency, we must ensure 
participation by trusted like-minded 
partners. The National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administra-
tion, NTIA, plays a central role in 
these efforts as the executive branch 
agency with technical expertise on 
wireless innovation. It has decades of 
experience working with industry and 
other stakeholders to develop these 
technical standards globally. I would 
also like to thank the dedicated career 
staff who worked tirelessly to advance 
U.S. global wireless leadership. 
As we move into the next decade, it 
is critical that we continue to enhance 
participation in critical standards-set-
ting bodies and preserve U.S. wireless 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this piece of legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues to support H.R. 3003, 
again a very important piece in our in-
frastructure in this country, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 3003, the Promoting 
United States Wireless Leadership Act of 
2021. 
The policy choices of today will have lasting 
effects on the global 5G technology develop-
ment of tomorrow. 
This bipartisan bill, which I co-led with my 
fellow 5G Caucus co-chairs, Representatives 
WALBERG, KUSTER, and JOHNSON, would solid-
ify United States leadership in 5G technology 
by encouraging interagency coordination, tech-
nical assistance, and stakeholder participation 
in international standard setting bodies. 
We must take concrete steps to lower bar-
riers to entry for U.S. companies and promote 
American competitiveness in this space. 
This legislation will ensure the United States 
remains at the forefront of innovation in this 
evolving frontier by playing a central role in 
setting international wireless standards in 
emerging technologies. This approach has 
dramatic ramifications for our global competi-
tiveness, 5G deployment, and our national se-
curity. 
I strongly urge all my colleagues to support 
this important bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3003. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
H.R. 678. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 678, the Preserving Home and 
Office Numbers in Emergencies Act or 
the PHONE Act. 
The PHONE Act is a bill that Rep-
resentative MIKE
THOMPSON
was in-
spired to write because of stories he 
heard at home in his district in the 
aftermath of devastating wildfires in 
northern California. After being evacu-
ated by the Atlas and Tubbs fires a few 
years ago, Representative THOMPSON’s 
constituents returned to their homes 
determined to rebuild what was lost; 
however, when it came time to hook up 
their telephone service again, they 
were rightly outraged to discover that 
the phone company had rescinded their 
phone numbers and, in most cases, re-
assigned them to different subscribers. 
Nobody should have to worry about 
losing a phone number they have had 
for years because their home or their 
small business was left uninhabitable 
by a natural disaster like a wildfire or 
a hurricane. This legislation makes 
sure that that doesn’t happen again. 
The PHONE Act prohibits providers 
from reassigning phone numbers of 
subscribers within an area subject to a 
major disaster declaration. Specifi-
cally, if the President has issued a 
major disaster declaration and a Gov-
ernor has designated the area to the 
FCC, the phone numbers in that des-
ignated area cannot be reassigned for 1 
year. And then, if a subscriber needs 
more time, this bill allows them to get 
a year-long extension. 
The legislation would also allow con-
sumers whose homes are inaccessible 
or uninhabitable to cancel their service 
without a cancellation fee or re-
subscription fee when they get phone 
service somewhere else in the area dur-
ing that covered period. 
What we are doing here, Mr. Speaker, 
ultimately is ensuring some stability 
for people who have lost their homes or 
businesses after a major disaster hits 
their community. This is one less thing 
that a resident or a small business will 
have to worry about as they work to 
pick up the pieces. In the age of 
robocalls, our phone numbers are how 
our friends and family know exactly 
who is trying to reach them when we 
call, and that is why this legislation is 
necessary. 
When disaster strikes, our constitu-
ents should know they won’t lose their 
numbers; especially the seniors and the 
small businesses who rely on landline 
telephones more than others. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative THOMPSON for his tireless 
leadership on this issue, as well as my 
Republican colleagues, for working 
with us to improve the bill before it 
passed the House last Congress. This is 
a really good bill, the same bill we 
passed and sent to the Senate last fall. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense legislation. 
I hope our colleagues in the Senate will 
finally take up the PHONE Act, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on 
H.R. 678, the PHONE Act. This legisla-
tion will ensure that Americans whose 
homes are lost during a fire or other 
natural disaster do not have to worry 
about losing their home phone num-
bers. 
As we have seen from the horrific 
fires over the last several years, they 
destroy everything in their path. No 
matter how resilient a home or com-
munications tower may be, you cannot 
regulate your way out of a fire’s burn-
ing path. 
Today, 
when 
a 
natural 
disaster 
strikes, the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency, FEMA, is activated 
to provide housing assistance and other 
resources to respond to the crisis at 
hand. If your home is completely 
burned to the ground, the last thing 
that you should have to worry about is 
if your home phone number will be 
available when you return. 
Thankfully, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, FCC, can prevent 
that from happening. The FCC can 
waive rules and regulations that re-
quire landline phone numbers to return 
to the pool of available numbers when 
a home is completely destroyed by a 
natural disaster. This bill codifies that 
process, but we still must be cautious. 
This type of relief should only apply to 
areas where significant physical dam-
age has occurred to render a home un-
inhabitable, as is the objective of the 
bill. 
It is FEMA’s role to determine which 
households have actually sustained 
damage in an affected county, which 
this bill does not codify, and we hope 
can be addressed as it moves through 
the process. As the experts on the 
ground, we should defer to their assess-
ment before these regulations go into 
effect. 
While it may be easy to grab a cell 
phone upon evacuating, landlines can-
not be brought on the go. For many 
people, especially our seniors, they rely 
on their landline phone number to stay 
connected to family, their doctor, and 
others during such a trying time in 
their life. During a traumatic event, 
one less thing they should not have to 
worry about is losing their home phone 
number. 
I ask for support of this measure 
moving forward, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the

gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 678, the 
PHONE Act. As we stand here today, 
wildfires are raging across the West, 
including in my home of northern Cali-
fornia. 
Last year, California witnessed a dev-
astating and terrible fire season. We 
saw some of the largest fires in the 
State’s history and a record-breaking 
4.4 million acres burned. Nearly every 
part of the State was blanketed by fire 
and smoke, and we really haven’t got-
ten much of a break. The number of 
wildfires and the amount of land 
burned in our State so far this year 
greatly exceeds the totals for the same 
period last year. 
Climate change is resulting in longer 
and more extreme wildfire seasons, and 
this is expected to continue. Worrying 
about deadly fires spreading quickly is 
the new norm that my constituents are 
now living in. And worrying about 
whether they will have to evacuate 
their homes is also part of this new 
norm. 
Because of this legislation that we 
are considering today, the PHONE Act, 
which I am proud to cosponsor, my 
constituents, Californians, and Ameri-
cans all across the country who are im-
pacted all too frequently now by nat-
ural disasters due to climate change, 
will have to worry about one less thing 
when they are forced to evacuate their 
homes, and that is their ability to keep 
their phone numbers. 
Under this legislation, communica-
tions providers will be prohibited from 
reassigning phone numbers of cus-
tomers in areas covered by a major dis-
aster declaration for the duration of 
the declaration, and this may be ex-
tended. The bill would also prohibit 
providers from assessing early termi-
nation fees to cancel services or con-
nection fees to resubscribe to a new ad-
dress for subscribers whose residence is 
inaccessible or uninhabitable due to 
major disaster. 
There is so much that wildfire vic-
tims already have to worry about. We 
must move quickly to ensure the 
PHONE Act is signed into law so there 
is one less item on their plate. It is 
hard enough to pick up the pieces after 
a disaster. Let’s not add insult to in-
jury. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
good 
friend, 
Representative 
MIKE 
THOMPSON, for his work on this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I support H.R. 678 mov-
ing forward, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Before we conclude this series of bills 
under the jurisdiction of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, I want to 
say that this is a bittersweet day for 
me. After 25 years of outstanding serv-
ice, Jeff Carroll, who is sitting behind 
me here, who has been my longtime 
chief of staff and is now the staff direc-
tor of the committee, will be leaving 
the House at the beginning of August, 
in just another 10 days or so. 
It would be an understatement to say 
that Jeff has been my most trusted ad-
viser for almost my entire time in Con-
gress. He is known to Members and 
staff on both sides of the aisle for his 
candor, political savvy, and commit-
ment to the little guy. 
He has never forgotten his roots back 
in New Jersey. That, again, would be 
an understatement. Many of you know 
that he is a diehard fan of Bruce 
Springsteen, but also the Mets, the Gi-
ants, and the vaunted pork roll. He is a 
Jersey guy through and through. I 
don’t think anybody would argue with 
that. 
He joined my staff as an executive as-
sistant in 1997 after graduating from 
George Washington University. I won’t 
tell you how many people from GW he 
has hired in the office and on the com-
mittee. Before that, he briefly served 
as a staff assistant to New Jersey’s 
then-Senator, Robert Torricelli. 
Shortly after joining my staff, Jeff 
took on the added responsibility of 
serving as my legislative aide on both 
labor and defense issues. It was here 
that he began his longtime work of 
protecting New Jersey military instal-
lations from closure. 
He was my defense staffer on 9/11 and 
during the debate on the Authorization 
for Use of Military Force against Iraq. 
I valued his counsel at the time, and 
my vote against that authorization and 
the invasion into Iraq remains one of 
my most proud moments as a Member 
of the House. But I have to tell you, 
without Jeff, it might not have turned 
out that way. 
Within 6 years, he became my chief 
of staff, serving with distinction the 
people of New Jersey’s Sixth Congres-
sional District for 12 years. 
Without a doubt, the largest crisis 
that we confronted during his time as 
my chief of staff was Superstorm 
Sandy in 2012. My congressional dis-
trict is along the coast of north Jersey, 
and was one of the hardest hit districts 
in the country by Sandy. For more 
than a year, Jeff led my team in re-
sponse and recovery, literally being out 
there. Both in New Jersey and here, 
they worked around the clock, helping 
families and small businesses pick up 
the pieces. 
Jeff also fought relentlessly, along 
with me and others in New Jersey and 
New York, to make sure we received 
the Federal assistance that our States 
needed and deserved. 
In 2015, when I was elected the rank-
ing member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee—and that was cer-
tainly in large part because of Jeff—he 
became the Democratic staff director. 
Then, 4 years later, when I became the 
chairman of the committee, Jeff be-
came the committee staff director. 
As staff director of the committee, 
Jeff has led the committee staff in all 
the committee’s accomplishments over 
the last 6 years. I am going to list some 
of them, but I have to tell you, it is an 
incredible 
list 
of 
accomplishments 
through Jeff’s efforts, including, of 
course, the latest, the COVID–19 pan-
demic and the severe economic down-
turn. 
Jeff 
helped 
shepherd 
four 
bills 
through the House to help combat the 
coronavirus that became law. These 
laws ensured Congress provided the 
tools and resources needed to bring an 
end to this terrible pandemic while 
also providing relief to struggling 
American families. 
Besides responding to the pandemic, 
Jeff was instrumental in our efforts, 
and I want to list some of the very im-
portant bills: to end surprise medical 
bills; to reduce and block robocalls; to 
phase down the production and con-
sumption of hydrofluorocarbons and 
mandate the repair of methane leaks; 
to protect Americans from suspected 
foreign 
communications 
network 
equipment; to reauthorize the Safe 
Drinking Water Act for the first time 
in 20 years; to expand treatment for 
people fighting opioid use disorder; to 
invest in new medical treatments and 
cures for some of the most debilitating 
and life-threatening diseases; to mod-
ernize the Toxic Substances Control 
Act, which took about 14 years, to bet-
ter protect public health and the envi-
ronment; and to extend critical funding 
for programs that improve the health 
and welfare of millions of children, 
families, and seniors across the coun-
try. That is not an exaggeration, Jeff’s 
role in all of that. 
He has been by my side through my 
greatest trials and achievements in of-
fice. My congressional office, the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, the 
Congress, and the Nation have bene-
fited enormously from Jeff’s commit-
ment to achieving meaningful progress 
for the American people. 
It means time away from his family. 
There have been a lot of long nights, 
late-night phone calls, which I am 
known for, and weekends spent work-
ing to move forward. 
I don’t know what to say other than 
to acknowledge the unwavering sup-
port that Jeff has received from his 
wife, Shannon; his daughter, Lizzie; 
and his son, Ryan. I thank them for 
sharing Jeff with all of us for all these 
years. 
I know I am going to be talking to 
Jeff and getting advice from Jeff, but 
when I say bittersweet, I really mean 
it. I don’t know how we are going to do 
without him, but I guess we have to 
continue. That is the way it goes. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by 
saying that the American people have 
benefited from Jeff Carroll’s 25 years of 
public service. I am going to miss him 
tremendously, and I wish him nothing 
but the best in his future pursuits. 
Mr. LATTA. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3650 
July 19, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate Jeff on his future endeav-
ors. 
Our staffs do so much for us. As the 
chairman was speaking, I was thinking 
that the hours that they put in aren’t 
ever recognized, including the work 
over the weekends. I know when I have 
talked to our committee staff, espe-
cially when we have worked on pieces 
of legislation the last several Con-
gresses, with the amount of work that 
goes into it, we have to thank our 
staff. 
For all his years of service here and 
for his future endeavors, I give him my 
best wishes. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of my bill, the PHONE 
Act of 2021. 
My district has been ravaged by wildfire 
every year since 2017. Thousands of homes 
have burned, and many families have been 
displaced. Following these fires, survivors 
called my office and told me they were losing 
their landline numbers because their phones 
had been disconnected for too long after their 
houses were destroyed. 
Fire survivors face so many hurdles on the 
road to recovery. Losing their phone number 
is the last thing they should worry about. 
That’s why I introduced the PHONE Act with 
Representative NEWHOUSE. This bipartisan 
legislation allows disaster survivors to keep 
their phone numbers and have some peace of 
mind while they rebuild. 
I thank Chairwoman ESHOO and the Com-
mittee for their attention to this important issue 
and I urge a yes vote on the PHONE Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 678. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

REFUGEE SANITATION FACILITY 
SAFETY ACT OF 2021 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1158) to provide women and 
girls safe access to sanitation facilities 
in refugee camps. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1158 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Refugee 
Sanitation Facility Safety Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. SECURE ACCESS TO SANITATION FACILI-
TIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. 
Subsection (a) of section 501 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 
1994 and 1995 (22 U.S.C. 2601 note) is amend-
ed— 
(1) by redesignating paragraphs (6) through 
(11) as paragraphs (7) through (12), respec-
tively; and 
(2) by inserting after paragraph (5) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(6) the provision of safe and secure access 
to sanitation facilities, with a special em-
phasis on women, girls, and vulnerable popu-
lations.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1158. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 1158, the Refugee Sani-
tation Facility Safety Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the U.N. 
High Commission for Refugees, by the 
end of 2020, there were at least 26 mil-
lion people worldwide living as refu-
gees, the highest number ever recorded. 
As people who have been forced to 
flee their home countries because of 
persecution or because of violence, ref-
ugees are amongst the globe’s most 
vulnerable populations. To make mat-
ters worse, these people must often set-
tle in areas that are inadequate in 
terms of necessities such as access to 
water, shelter, and sanitation. 
Simply put, the conditions that refu-
gees regularly endure are unaccept-
able. People should not have to sur-
render their access to sanitation in ex-
change for their own safety. 
That is why I support the Refugee 
Sanitation Facility Safety Act. This 
bill would ensure that refugees have 
safe and secure access to sanitation fa-
cilities, with a special emphasis on 
women, girls, and the most vulnerable 
populations. 
By providing for safe and secure sani-
tation facilities, this bill will not only 
improve the health and safety of tens 
of millions living in refugee settle-
ments, but it will also allow these 
same people to focus more of their en-
ergy and ingenuity into rebuilding 
their lives. 
I thank my colleague from New 
York, Representative GRACE MENG, a 
tireless champion for the rights of vul-
nerable people, women, and girls, for 
authoring this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Refugee Sanitation Facility Safety 
Act. 
I 
commend 
my 
colleagues, 
Rep-
resentative 
MENG
and 
Chairman 
MEEKS, for their work on this issue. 
Around the world, we are seeing un-
precedented levels of displacement due 
to conflict and humanitarian disasters. 
Unfortunately, many of these crises 
have gone on for many years, even dec-
ades, like we have seen in South 
Sudan. 
I would just note, parenthetically, 
my good friend KAREN BASS and I have 
been to refugee camps throughout Afri-
ca and have seen the great work that is 
done by the United States, working 
with the UNHCR and other inter-
national organizations, literally saving 
people who otherwise would die of star-
vation or sickness, so what a great hu-
manitarian effort made by this country 
and by others, including the UNHCR. 
I would point out to my colleagues 
that new emergencies, like Ethiopia 
and the growing instability in Afghani-
stan, have stretched the capabilities of 
the United Nations and the inter-
national community. The COVID–19 
pandemic, as it surges in much of the 
developing world, is only making these 
crises worse. Lack of access to clean 
water and cramped living conditions 
continues to hamper prevention ef-
forts. 
A generation of young people is grow-
ing up knowing only life in a refugee 
camp. The conditions in many of these 
camps around the world are dire and 
particularly dangerous for vulnerable 
populations, such as women and chil-
dren. 
This bill ensures support for safe 
sanitation facilities for refugees and 
displaced 
persons 
living 
in 
camps 
around the world. 
The U.S. continues to be the largest 
donor to refugees and displaced persons 
around the world. That has been a his-
torical fact no matter who was in the 
White House, speaking to the humani-
tarian beliefs of this country to care 
for those who are at risk and who are 
vulnerable. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is lifesaving legis-
lation. By helping ensure that women 
and children, who make up the major-
ity of refugees around the world, have 
access to safe and secure sanitation fa-
cilities, this body will dramatically im-
prove the health and quality of life of 
millions of people who have already 
suffered so much. 
Again, I thank my friend, Congress-
woman MENG, for introducing this in-
valuable legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to give it their full support, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
1158.

DIVIDED FAMILIES 
REUNIFICATION ACT 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 826) to require consultations 
on reuniting Korean Americans with 
family members in North Korea. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 826 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Divided 
Families Reunification Act’’. 
SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN 
AMERICANS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS 
IN NORTH KOREA. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The division of the Korean Peninsula 
into South Korea and North Korea separated 
thousands of Koreans from family members. 
(2) Since the signing of the Agreement 
Concerning a Military Armistice in Korea, 
signed at Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (com-
monly referred to as the ‘‘Korean War Armi-
stice Agreement’’), there has been little to 
no contact between Korean Americans and 
family members who remain in North Korea. 
(3) North Korea and South Korea first 
agreed to reunions of divided families in 1985 
and have since held 21 face-to-face reunions 
and multiple video link reunions. 
(4) Those reunions have subsequently given 
approximately 24,500 Koreans the oppor-
tunity to briefly reunite with loved ones. 
(5) The most recent family reunions be-
tween North Korea and South Korea took 
place in August 2018 and did not include any 
Korean Americans. 
(6) The United States and North Korea do 
not maintain diplomatic relations and cer-
tain limitations exist on Korean Americans 
participating in face-to-face reunions. 
(7) According to the most recent census, 
more than 1,700,000 people living in the 
United States are of Korean descent. 
(8) The number of first generation Korean 
and Korean American family members di-
vided from family members in North Korea 
is rapidly diminishing given the advanced 
age of those family members. More than 3,000 
elderly South Koreans die each year without 
having been reunited with their family mem-
bers. 
(9) Many Korean Americans with family 
members in North Korea have not seen or 
communicated with those family members in 
more than 60 years. 
(10) The inclusion of Korean American fam-
ilies in the reunion process, with the support 
of international organizations with expertise 
in family tracing, would constitute a posi-
tive humanitarian gesture by the Govern-
ment of North Korea. 
(11) Section 1265 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub-
lic Law 110–181; 122 Stat. 407) required the 
President to submit to Congress a report on 
‘‘efforts, if any, of the United States Govern-
ment to facilitate family reunions between 
United States citizens and their relatives in 
North Korea’’. 
(12) The position of Special Envoy on 
North Korean Human Rights Issues has been 
vacant since January 2017, although the 
President is required to appoint a Senate- 
confirmed Special Envoy to fill this position 
in accordance with section 107 of the North 
Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 
7817). 
(13) In the report of the Committee on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives 
accompanying H.R. 3081, 111th Congress 
(House Report 111–187), the Committee urged 
‘‘the Special Representative on North Korea 
Policy, as the senior official handling North 
Korea issues, to prioritize the issues involv-
ing Korean divided families and to, if nec-
essary, appoint a coordinator for such fami-
lies’’. 
(14) In the report of the Committee on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives 
accompanying 
H.R. 
133, 
116th 
Congress 
(House Report 116–444), the Committee urged 
‘‘the Office of North Korean Human Rights, 
in consultation with Korean American com-
munity organizations, to identify Korean 
Americans who wish to be reunited with 
their family in North Korea in anticipation 
of future reunions’’. 
(b) CONSULTATIONS.— 
(1) CONSULTATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA.—The 
Secretary of State, or a designee of the Sec-
retary, should consult with officials of South 
Korea, as appropriate, on potential opportu-
nities to reunite Korean American families 
with family members in North Korea from 
which such Korean American families were 
divided after the signing of the Korean War 
Armistice Agreement, including potential 
opportunities for video reunions for Korean 
Americans with such family members. 
(2) CONSULTATIONS
WITH
KOREAN
AMERI-
CANS.—The Special Envoy on North Korean 
Human Rights Issues of the Department of 
State should regularly consult with rep-
resentatives of Korean Americans who have 
family members in North Korea with respect 
to efforts to reunite families divided after 
the signing of the Korean War Armistice 
Agreement, including potential opportuni-
ties for video reunions for Korean Americans 
with such family members. 
(3) NO ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS.—No additional amounts are au-
thorized to be appropriated to the Depart-
ment of State to carry out consultations 
under this subsection. 
(c) ADDITIONAL MATTER
IN REPORT.—The 
Secretary of State, acting through the Spe-
cial Envoy on North Korean Human Rights 
Issues, shall include in each report required 
under section 107(d) of the North Korean 
Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7817(d)), 
a description of the consultations described 
in subsection (b) conducted during the year 
preceding the submission of each report re-
quired under such section 107(d). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 826. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 826, the Divided Families Re-
unification Act, introduced by my col-
league, Representative GRACE
MENG, 
who has been a tireless champion of re-
uniting divided Korean-American fami-
lies. 
This bill encourages the State De-
partment to engage with the South Ko-
rean Government and Korean-Amer-
ican families regarding opportunities 
to reunite those families with their rel-
atives in North Korea. 
b 1530 
Many Korean Americans have been 
unable to see or hear from their loved 
ones for over 70 years, a unique heart-
ache that very few of us can really un-
derstand. 
Family is the bedrock of our society. 
Tragically, for thousands of Korean 
Americans, their sisters and brothers 
and even daughters and sons have been 
painfully out of reach through no fault 
of their own. 
While there have been 21 family re-
unions held between North and South 
Korea since 1985, Korean Americans 
with family members in North Korea 
have been unable to participate. 
As many of these Korean Americans 
are aging, we must advocate for hu-
mane and commonsense policy to help 
Korean-American families reunite with 
their loved ones in North Korea. We 
have the resources and the technology 
to reunite these families. What we need 
now is action to implement a more 
compassionate policy. 
This is an important measure. I sup-
port it, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in support of the Divided 
Families Reunification Act. The sor-
rowful legacy of the Korean war is with 
us even today, almost 70 years after 
the Korean Armistice Agreement was 
signed. 
The Korean peninsula remains di-
vided between a nation of free people 
and a nation that subjects its people to 
utter tyranny. 
The barbaric Kim regime continues 
to threaten the peace and security of 
South Korea, the region, and even the 
world. 
And families remain broken, from 
those still fighting to bring their loved 
ones’ remains home, to those with fam-
ily members trapped in North Korea. 
This is an attempt to try to say let’s 
get this moving to try to get those 
families reunited. 
Our vibrant Korean-American com-
munity, led by groups such as the Ko-
rean American Grassroots Conference,

feels this legacy strongly, so I com-
mend Congresswoman MENG for intro-
ducing this legislation which directs 
the State Department to consult with 
South Korea and Korean Americans on 
opportunities to reunite families sepa-
rated by the DMZ. 
I also trust that the State Depart-
ment will be vigilant in ensuring that 
organizations with ties to North Korea 
will not be exploiting the desire of 
these families to be reunited with their 
loved ones to raise hard currency for 
the Kim regime. 
Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, I 
urge support for the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. KIM), the vice ranking 
member of the Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee on Asia and the Pacific and 
an original cosponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I am proud to stand in support of H.R. 
826, the Divided Families Reunification 
Act, and I want to thank Congress-
woman MENG for introducing this bill 
and the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee for ensuring a speedy passage of 
this timely legislation. 
I am also proud to colead another bill 
under consideration today that ad-
dresses this issue, H. Res. 294, intro-
duced by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS). 
Since implementing family reunions 
in 1985, the South and North Korean 
Governments have facilitated 21 in-per-
son reunions and seven video reunions. 
However, the nearly 100,000 Korean 
Americans with family members in 
North Korea have been left out of this 
process entirely. 
As a longtime advocate for human 
rights and humanitarian aid in North 
Korea, I have consistently spoken on 
the need to prioritize these issues, es-
pecially by appointing a Special Envoy 
for North Korean human rights issues, 
which has remained vacant since 2017, 
and remains unfilled under President 
Biden. 
Time is running out for separated 
family members, as many are in their 
eighties and nineties, and their num-
bers continue to dwindle. Congress and 
the Biden administration must come 
together to make Korean-American 
participation and reunifications a re-
ality before it is too late. 
My mother-in-law was one of the 
many Koreans who made the brave 
journey across the 38th parallel line to 
bring her family to South Korea. She 
crossed five times to go back and forth 
and bring family members across to 
South Korea. 
As an immigrant from South Korea 
whose family lived through the Korean 
war, and now as one of the first Ko-
rean-American women to serve in Con-
gress, I am proud to use my voice in 
support of this issue that is deeply per-
sonal to me and our Korean-American 
community. 
I want to again thank Representa-
tives KAREN BASS and GRACE MENG for 
introducing these measures and for 
working to garner strong bipartisan 
support. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
House passage of these bills today and 
for the Senate to prioritize consider-
ation of this issue on behalf of the tens 
of thousands of Korean Americans 
alive today waiting to reunite with 
their long lost family members. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, for decades Korean 
Americans have been unable to see or 
speak with their family members in 
North Korea, and for too many, time is 
running out. This heartbreaking re-
ality has taken a huge toll, and it is 
time to take action. 
This bill, introduced by my col-
league, Representative MENG, would 
spur the State Department into finding 
opportunities to reunite them with 
their loved ones and to address this hu-
manitarian issue that has caused so 
much heartache for countless Korean 
Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in favor of H.R. 826, the Divided Fami-
lies Reunification Act, a bill I authored to raise 
the voices of families who have been sepa-
rated for decades both across the DMZ and 
across the Pacific Ocean. 
I want to thank Chairman MEEKS for working 
with me on this important issue, and for his ef-
forts to bring this bill to the floor. I also want 
to thank Congressman VAN
TAYLOR
who 
partnered with me to introduce this humane 
and commonsense legislation, which, during 
the 116th Congress, unanimously passed the 
House of Representatives. 
Over seventy years ago, millions of Koreans 
were plunged into a harrowing war that 
brought misery, death, and destruction to their 
lives. Since then, the war has been frozen by 
an armistice agreement, signed on July 27, 
1953, that persists to today. The division of 
the Korean Peninsula into South and North 
Korea separated millions of Koreans from their 
family members. Through the years, there 
have been some agreed upon reunions be-
tween South and North Koreans. For Korean 
Americans, however, there is no pathway for 
such reunions, as they have not been per-
mitted to participate in these inter-Korean fam-
ily reunions. Many of these Americans are in 
their 70s through 90s, and time is of the es-
sence to be reunited with their families. I have 
had the honor to meet some of these divided 
Korean American family members, and it 
breaks my heart that their chance of a reunion 
with their loved ones grows less likely each 
day. 
As a member of the State and Foreign Op-
erations 
(SFOPS) 
Subcommittee 
on 
the 
House Appropriations Committee, I am proud 
to have secured provisions in the Fiscal Year 
2020 and 2021 accompanying reports that 
support the reunification of Korean Americans 
and their families in North Korea. And in the 
SFOPS Fiscal Year 2022, which recently 
passed out of the full committee, a provision 
calling on the Office of North Korean Human 
Rights to investigate the risks associated with 
third-party brokers who offer to locate and re-
unite divided families. 
The unresolved status of the war continues 
to impact multiple generations of Korean 
Americans, particularly women, in myriad 
ways. All these years later, many survivors of 
the war are still haunted by their trauma. And 
younger generations who are responsible for 
their caregiving often internalize this unre-
solved grief. 
The Divided Families Reunification Act re-
quires the Secretary of State or a designee to 
consult with officials in South Korea on poten-
tial opportunities to reunite Korean American 
families with family members in North Korea. 
This bill will also require the Special Envoy on 
North Korean Human Rights to submit a report 
on the opportunities for video reunions be-
tween Korean Americans and family members 
in North Korea. 
With that Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bipartisan bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
826. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (in 
this resolution referred to as ‘‘North Korea’’) 
in the North, remains divided following the 
signing of the Korean War Armistice Agree-
ment on July 27, 1953; 
Whereas the division of the Korean Penin-
sula separated more than 10,000,000 Korean 
family members, including some who are 
now citizens of the United States; 
Whereas there have been 21 rounds of fam-
ily reunions between South Koreans and 
North Koreans along the border since 2000;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3653 
July 19, 2021 
Whereas Congress signaled its support for 
family reunions between United States citi-
zens and their relatives in North Korea in 
section 1265 of the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
110–181), signed into law by President George 
W. Bush on January 28, 2008; 
Whereas most of the population of divided 
family members in the United States, ini-
tially estimated at 100,000 in 2001, has signifi-
cantly dwindled as many of the individuals 
have passed away; 
Whereas the summit between North Korea 
and South Korea on April 27, 2018, has 
prioritized family reunions; 
Whereas the United States and North 
Korea have engaged in talks during 2 his-
toric summits in June 2018 in Singapore and 
February 2019 in Hanoi; and 
Whereas many Korean Americans are wait-
ing for a chance to meet their relatives in 
North Korea for the first time in more than 
60 years: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to begin the process of reuniting Ko-
rean-American divided family members with 
their immediate relatives through ways such 
as— 
(A) identifying divided families in the 
United States and North Korea who are will-
ing and able to participate in a pilot pro-
gram for family reunions; 
(B) finding matches for members of such 
families through organizations such as the 
Red Cross; and 
(C) working with the Government of South 
Korea to include American citizens in inter- 
Korean video reunions; 
(2) reaffirms the institution of family as 
inalienable and, accordingly, urges the res-
toration of contact between divided families 
physically, literarily, or virtually; and 
(3) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to pursue reunions as a humanitarian 
priority of immediate concern. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
294. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
House Resolution 294, a resolution en-
couraging reunions of divided Korean- 
American families, introduced by the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BASS). 
The Korean war claimed millions of 
lives and left the Korean peninsula and 
its 
people 
absolutely 
devastated. 
Though an armistice ended hostilities 
between North and South Korea nearly 
70 years ago, many of the wounds in-
flicted by the war have never fully 
healed, in part because more than 10 
million Koreans were separated from 
their family members during that con-
flict. 
Today, there are still thousands of 
Korean Americans who live waiting 
and hoping for the chance to see their 
relatives living in North Korea. 
Mr. Speaker, the pain of being sepa-
rated from your family does not dull 
with time. This resolution would give 
peace of mind to many by identifying 
families in the United States and in 
North Korea who are willing and able 
to participate in family reunification. 
This resolution would also allow for 
organizations like the Red Cross to as-
sist in reuniting families and working 
with our allies in South Korea to re-
unite families through video reunions. 
We must act now because the number 
of surviving relatives is declining, and 
time is running out to right the wrong 
these families have suffered. There is 
an urgent humanitarian need to re-
unite Korean Americans with their 
war-torn loved ones and to provide 
much-needed healing, closure, and res-
toration of bonds broken seven decades 
ago. 
By passing this humane, bipartisan 
resolution, this body will provide Ko-
rean Americans the precious oppor-
tunity they have been denied for too 
long. I thank Representative BASS for 
authoring 
this 
important 
humani-
tarian legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 294, which reaffirms the 
House’s commitment to support our 
Korean-American families seeking to 
reunite with relatives who are trapped 
in North Korea. 
The resolution, authored by my good 
friend and colleague, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BASS), rightly ob-
serves that family reunification is a 
humanitarian priority. 
As she points out, it calls on the 
United States and North Korea to 
begin the process of reuniting North 
Korean and Korean-American divided 
family members with their immediate 
relatives through ways such as—and I 
quote from the resolution: 
‘‘Identifying divided families in the 
United States and North Korea who are 
willing and able to participate in a 
pilot program for family reunions; 
‘‘Finding matches for members of 
such families through organizations 
such as the Red Cross; and 
‘‘Working with the Government of 
South Korea to include American citi-
zens in inter-Korean video reunions; 
‘‘Reaffirms the institution of the 
family as inalienable and, accordingly, 
urges the restoration of contact be-
tween divided families physically, lit-
erarily, or virtually.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, it is a very, very good 
resolution. I thank my good friend and 
colleague for authoring it. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS), my great friend, 
who is a champion of these issues. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank 
Chairman 
MEEKS, 
Ranking 
Member MCCAUL, and Ranking Member 
SMITH for bringing this important leg-
islation encouraging reunions of di-
vided Korean-American families to the 
House floor today. 
H. Res. 294 is a bipartisan resolution 
that calls on the United States and 
North Korea to begin the process of re-
uniting Korean-American divided fam-
ily members with their immediate rel-
atives by identifying the families in 
the U.S. and North Korea who are will-
ing and able to participate, finding 
matches for members of such families 
through organizations such as the Red 
Cross, and working with the Govern-
ment of South Korea to include Amer-
ican citizens in inter-Korean video re-
unions. 
Both Representative KIM and I have 
heard or know the awful stories of con-
stituents who were divided from family 
members for nearly 70 years. A couple 
of years ago I had a constituent in my 
office who was quite elderly, and he 
was very concerned that he actually 
was not going to live to see his siblings 
that he has not been able to see for 
many decades. 
This resolution also urges the res-
toration of contact between the divided 
families physically, literarily, or vir-
tually, and calls on the U.S. and North 
Korea to pursue reunions as a humani-
tarian priority of immediate concern. 
When the Korean War Armistice 
Agreement was signed in 1953, it was 
meant to be a temporary measure. 
There has been relative peace between 
North and South Korea, but tensions 
remain volatile, and the border sepa-
rating them is heavily militarized. 
More than 10 million families, includ-
ing those who are now U.S. citizens, 
have been divided, and we must do ev-
erything we can to prevent this from 
continuing. 
Representative KIM and I agree that 
Korean Americans should not have to 
wait another day, let alone another 70 
years to meet their family members 
who live in North Korea. The bipar-
tisan support shows that this resolu-
tion wants to support the administra-
tion and find a sustainable solution to 
this important issue. 
I want to thank Representative KIM 
and many of my other colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for cosponsoring 
H. Res. 294. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, for nearly 70 years, Ko-
rean Americans and their relatives 
have hoped and prayed to one day be 
together again. We cannot allow any

SECURING AMERICA FROM 
EPIDEMICS ACT 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2118) to authorize United 
States participation in the Coalition 
for 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innova-
tions, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2118 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing 
America From Epidemics Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecologi-
cal change, emerging infectious diseases pose 
a real and growing threat to global health 
security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effec-
tive tools to protect against infectious dis-
ease, the absence of vaccines for a new or 
emerging infectious disease with epidemic 
potential is a major health security threat 
globally, 
posing 
catastrophic 
potential 
human and economic costs. 
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has infected 
more than 119,960,700 individuals and has 
killed at least 2,656,822 people worldwide, and 
it is likely that unreported cases and deaths 
are significant. 
(4) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt 
the global economy and cripple regional 
economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa killed more than 11,000 and cost 
$2,800,000,000 in losses in the affected coun-
tries alone. 
(5) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets 
to drive the necessary development of vac-
cines to address them—a complex and expen-
sive undertaking—are very often critically 
absent. Also absent are mechanisms to en-
sure access to those vaccines by those who 
need them when they need them. 
(6) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institu-
tional capacity, and funding, in 2017, several 
countries and private partners launched the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions (CEPI). CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, 
finance, and coordinate development of vac-
cines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
threats in cases where traditional markets 
do not exist or cannot create sufficient de-
mand. 
(7) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can 
be rapidly deployed against emerging patho-
gens. 
(8) CEPI supported the manufacturing of 
the 
United 
States-developed 
Moderna 
COVID–19 vaccine during its Phase 1 clinical 
trial, and CEPI has initiated at least 12 part-
nerships to develop vaccines against COVID– 
19. 
(9) CEPI is co-leading COVAX, the vaccines 
pillar of the ACT–Accelerator, which is a 
global collaboration to quickly produce and 
equitably distribute safe and effective vac-
cines and therapeutics for COVID–19. 
(10) Support for and participation in CEPI 
is an important part of the United States 
own health security and biodefense and is in 
the national interest, complementing the 
work of many Federal agencies and pro-
viding significant value through global part-
nership and burden-sharing. 
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES 
PARTICIPATION. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—The United States is 
hereby authorized to participate in the Coa-
lition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions (‘‘Coalition’’).

(2) if nominated by the President, on the 
Board of Directors of the Coalition, as a rep-
resentative of the United States. 
(c) REPORTS TO CONGRESS.—Not later than

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the

from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes.

woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2118. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2118, the Securing America 
From Epidemics Act. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
AMI
BERA, 
chairman 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Asia, the Pacific, Cen-
tral Asia and Nonproliferation for 
championing this important bill that 
will save the lives and protect the 
United States from the threat of future 
pandemics. 
This bill would authorize the United 
States to participate in the Coalition 
for 
Epidemic 
Preparedness 
Innova-
tions, or CEPI, a private-public part-
nership that helps accelerate the devel-
opment of vaccines against emergent 
infections, including Ebola and COVID– 
19. 
The COVID–19 crisis has shown just 
how interconnected our world is and 
how important vaccines are to ending 
one of the greatest catastrophes of the 
21st century. By developing vaccines 
and enabling countries to administer 
vaccine doses effectively, we can end 
pandemics. We do this by ensuring vac-
cines get into the arms of the most vul-
nerable, and by instilling confidence in 
people that the vaccine saves lives. 
Now more than ever with the rise of 
the deadly delta variant, and COVID–19 
cases ravaging clusters across the 
country where vaccination rates are 
low, the collective resources of the pri-
vate sector, multilateral organizations, 
national governments, civil society, 
and health experts are all vital to end-
ing the pandemic. 
By supporting CEPI, we demonstrate 
the value of leveraging individual 
strengths towards collective action and 
create a leading global framework of 
developing an effective vaccine re-
sponse to stop future pandemics.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Securing 
America 
From 
Epidemics 
Act. 
I thank my colleagues, Congressmen 
BERA and FITZPATRICK, for introducing 
this bill and for their work to address 
this important issue. 
COVID–19 has shown once again that 
pandemics know no borders, and that 
the United States and the world must 
be better prepared to respond to dis-
ease outbreaks, including pandemics, 
around the world. 
The bill authorizes the United States 
to participate in the Coalition for Epi-
demic Preparedness Innovations, or 
CEPI, an alliance of countries and pri-
vate partners that are financing and 
coordinating the developing of new 
vaccines for infectious diseases. 
In addition to COVID–19, CEPI has 
developed a list of priority diseases 
with 
epidemic 
potential, 
including 
MERS, the Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome. 
By leveraging contributions from 
member states with expertise and fund-
ing by private partners, CEPI seeks to 
develop vaccines before a disease out-
break occurs. 
I would note, parenthetically, that in 
October of 2020, the Trump administra-
tion gave CEPI a $20 million grant to 
advance its work. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the Johns 
Hopkins Resource Center, COVID–19 
has killed over 4,092,000 people world-
wide, including 609,000 in the United 
States and in my home State of New 
Jersey, 26,545 deaths, the most COVID– 
19 deaths per capita in the United 
States. 
The pandemic could cost the global 
economy approximately $10 trillion, or 
more than 12 percent of global GDP. 
The loss of jobs and businesses is un-
precedented in modern times. And all 
of us know it from our case work work-
ing with our local businesses. This has 
been an incredibly horrible pandemic, 
and we have to make sure it is never 
repeated. 
Developing vaccines and treatment 
for emerging infectious diseases is not 
just an issue of individual health, but 
it is important to national security, in-
cluding economic security. 
Our committee has worked together 
on many pieces of legislation over the 
last several months in response to 
COVID–19. The SAFE Act, for example, 
is an example of this kind of bipartisan 
effort. 
I urge all my colleagues who believe 
we must do all we can to prevent an-
other pandemic like COVID–19 from 
emerging in the future to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, COVID–19 has dem-
onstrated the need for collective global 
action to end pandemics. The Securing 
America From Epidemics Act author-
izes the United States to galvanize 
that collective response by partnering 
in CEPI so that we may lead in build-
ing a more effective global framework. 
We call COVID–19 a once-in-a-century 
pandemic, but we all share concerns 
that with the world growing smaller 
and smaller every day that these out-
breaks will only become more and 
more frequent and clearly more cata-
strophic. There is an urgent need for 
the public-private global action H.R. 
2118 would help accelerate, not only for 
COVID–19, but God forbid, for any 
other future pandemics. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
AMI BERA, for his leadership in cham-
pioning this bill. I urge my colleagues 
to support this legislation, and, Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
2118. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

DESERT LOCUST CONTROL ACT 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1079) to establish an inter-
agency working group to develop a 
comprehensive, strategic plan to con-
trol locust outbreaks in the East Afri-
ca region and address future outbreaks 
in order to avert mass scale food inse-
curity and potential political desta-
bilization, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1079 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Desert Lo-
cust Control Act’’. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to 
prioritize efforts to control the ongoing 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate the impacts 
on food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability, improve interagency co-
ordination to prevent future outbreaks, and 
promote resilience in affected countries. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States Agency for Inter-
national Development reports that countries 
in East Africa are currently suffering the 
worst desert locust outbreak in decades, 
which will devour crops and pasture and de-
stroy local livelihoods across the region. 
(2) As of December 2020, the Food and Agri-
culture Organization reported that there 
were 42 million people experiencing acute 
food insecurity in East Africa, which num-
bers are projected to increase if the desert 
locust outbreak is not controlled. 
(3) The desert locust outbreak in East Afri-
ca, particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and So-
malia, is negatively impacting food security, 
local livelihoods and economic productivity, 
and may threaten political stability in the 
region. 
(4) Proactive investments now to control 
the desert locust outbreak could reduce the 
need for a much larger United States human-
itarian response effort later, as well as sup-
port economic and political stability and 
build resilience in affected countries. 
(5) In order to optimize the United States 
response to the desert locust outbreak, an 
interagency working group should be estab-
lished to develop and implement a com-
prehensive, strategic plan to control the 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate impacts on 
food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability and prevent future out-
breaks. 
SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The President shall 
establish an interagency working group to 
coordinate the United States response to the 
ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Afri-
ca and other affected regions, including the

(2) assess the impacts of restrictions relat-
ing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic 
on efforts to control the desert locust out-
break and mitigate its impacts and in exac-
erbating food insecurity; 
(3) monitor the effectiveness of ongoing as-
sistance efforts to control the desert locust 
outbreak and mitigate its impacts and iden-
tify gaps and opportunities for additional 
support to such programs; 
(4) review the effectiveness of regional and 
multilateral efforts to control the desert lo-
cust outbreak and the coordination among

committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1079, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1079, the Desert Locust Control 
Act introduced by my colleague, Rep-
resentative CHRIS SMITH, ranking mem-
ber of the Africa and Global Health and 
Global Human Rights Subcommittee. 
Starting in late 2019, swarms of lo-
custs entered the Horn of Africa from 
the Gulf of Aden, multiplying and 
spreading throughout the region. Ever 
since it began, the locust outbreak has 
plagued 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
and 
threatened their ability to lead full 
lives, generate income, and to feed 
themselves and their families. 
Locusts are a highly mobile insect 
and have the capacity to consume vast 
amounts of crops in a very short period 
of time. Even a small swarm can con-
sume food for up to 35,000 people each 
day. This has devastated large swaths 
of crops throughout East Africa, in-
cluding Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, 
and stretching as far as Uganda and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Food security is already hanging by a 
thread in this region, and efforts to 
control the scale of destruction have 
been hindered by COVID restrictions, 
lack of reliable data, and the geo-
graphic reach of the outbreak across 
multiple countries. While some efforts 
have been successful in containing the 
outbreak from spreading further into 
West Africa, good rains this spring al-
lowed for additional breeding, threat-
ening future harvests in Somalia and 
Ethiopia. This measure would har-
monize efforts across the United States 
Government to evaluate and respond to 
the locust outbreak, bringing in the 
support of the U.S. mission to the Food 
and Agricultural Organization, USAID, 
and others to establish a working 
group responding to the outbreak. 
We have already seen the ripple ef-
fects of COVID on poverty, food insecu-
rity, health, education, and so much 
more. We must ensure that we don’t let 
this outbreak continue to exacerbate 
and accelerate those already existing 
challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Desert Locust Control 
Act, a bill I introduced along with my 
good friend and colleague, Representa-
tive KAREN BASS of California, and we 
have worked on this issue together for 
quite a long time trying to mitigate its 
impact that it is having, particularly 
on Africa. 
I thank Representatives MEEKS and 
MCCAUL for their work in ensuring that 
this legislation is on the floor today so 
that we can vote on it and hopefully 
see it enacted into law. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will establish— 
and this is the core of it—an inter-
agency working group to develop a 
comprehensive, strategic plan to con-
trol locust outbreaks in the East Afri-
ca region and address future outbreaks 
in order to avert famine, starvation, 
and mass scale food insecurity and po-
tential political destabilization that 
goes along with all of that. 
According to USAID: ‘‘The desert lo-
cust is one of the most destructive mi-
gratory pests in the entire world, rap-
idly consuming most vegetation in its 
path, including crops and pastureland 
critical to maintaining the food secu-
rity and livelihoods of populations in 
East Africa. Locust swarms are highly 
mobile 
and 
carried 
on 
the 
wind; 
swarms can travel up to 100 miles per 
day, and even a relatively small, 0.4 
square mile-sized swarm can consume 
an amount of food sufficient for ap-
proximately 35,000 people in one day.’’ 
As recently as July 6, the U.N. Food 
and Agriculture Organization, or FAO, 
has said that ‘‘a desert locust upsurge 
is still underway in the Greater Horn 
of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula,’’ 
and that ‘‘although substantial control 
operations are underway, the battle to 
control the desert locust is not yet 
over.’’ 
The World Bank notes that: ‘‘A new 
generation of locusts emerges every 
eight weeks. Each generation, on aver-
age, sees a 20-fold increase in the popu-
lation. The growing swarms spread to 
new areas, disrupting the food supply, 
upending livelihoods and requiring sub-
stantial resources to address.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I believe there are three 
very important reasons to support this 
bill. 
The first is an obligation that we 
have to mitigate suffering wherever we 
are able to do so, and prevent starva-
tion, 
famine, 
food 
insecurity, 
and 
stunting. Stunting increases when food 
is not available to young people espe-
cially during the first thousand days of 
life from conception to the second 
birthday. 
The second is our strategic U.S. na-
tional interest. Food insecurity causes 
instability, as we saw with the rise of 
the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt a 
decade ago. Here, the Horn of Africa is 
vitally important, and we see an area 
wracked by war and violence, be it the 
war in the Tigray region of Ethiopia 
and ethnic violence elsewhere in that 
strategically important country, or Al- 
Shabaab’s efforts in neighboring Soma-
lia to establish a radical terror regime. 
On top of this political chaos then is 
the food crisis caused by locusts, com-
pounded by the ongoing COVID con-
cerns. 
The third is that this legislation is 
both penny-wise and pound-wise. The 
bill calls for greater intergovernmental 
coordination so that we don’t waste re-
sources through redundant efforts but 
work in a highly coordinated fashion. 
Further, by addressing the food insecu-
rity problem at the source, the locusts, 
we mitigate the need down the road to 
provide disaster and humanitarian as-
sistance, which is more costly not only 
in terms of dollars, but most impor-
tantly in terms of human lives. 
I would further note that just last 
week Administrator Samantha Power 
addressed the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and she addressed how spending 
a little money up front can save more 
down the road, while underscoring 
there is much work to be done. 
She said: ‘‘We have treated more 
than 5 million acres of infested lands 
since 2020‘‘—and the last administra-
tion and this administration is very fo-
cused, I would say parenthetically, on 
this—‘‘preventing the loss of four mil-
lion metric tons of crops. That’s $1.2 
billion worth of crop yields that were 
saved by virtue of this effort. I gather 
that things got better and now are 
turning downward again, so that is 
something that has my attention.’’

She went on to say: ‘‘Whether it is 
providing surveillance, aircraft train-
ing, pesticides, and training about how 
to use the pesticides in order to avoid 
environmental damage and so forth—it 
is a very important enabling com-
plement to the other work we do on 
food security.’’ 
b 1600 
Finally, I would like to call attention 
to the yeoman’s work that was done by 
our past ambassador to the United Na-
tions Food Agencies, Kip Tom. This is 
an absolutely critical position that 
tends to be overlooked. 
He advised us, provided unbelievably 
important insights and information 
that helped us craft a response to push 
the previous administration to do 
more. And, hopefully, this will help co-
ordinate everything. 
I would note, parenthetically, that 
President Biden has nominated Cindy 
McCain to fill that role at FAO, and I 
look forward to working with her and 
the rest of the administration on this 
important initiative. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS), the lead Demo-
crat on this bill. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, once again I 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for bringing H.R. 1079, the 
Desert Locust Control Act to the House 
floor today. As chair of the sub-
committee, I am glad to colead this 
important bill with Ranking Member 
SMITH. 
Ranking Member SMITH has been the 
lead on this issue for several years. The 
current Desert Locust Control issue, 
which predominantly plagues East Af-
rica, is the worst it has been in 70 
years, and is causing serious famine 
and instability in the region. 
During a recent House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee hearing, USAID Ad-
ministrator 
Samantha 
Power 
con-
firmed the need to address the millions 
of people facing food scarcity. This is 
compounded with the global resurgence 
of a new COVID–19 variant; although, 
in Africa, most people do not yet have 
access to the vaccine. So this is not 
just an issue of a pest; this is an issue 
that affects health systems, child edu-
cation, local economies, and political 
stability. 
H.R. 1079 is a great first step to al-
leviate the locust problem in East Afri-
ca by aiming to set up an interagency 
working group to develop a strategy on 
combating the locust by meeting peri-
odically and annually, and reporting 
progress to Congress. This bill would 
also allow the interagency working 
group to review the effectiveness of re-
gional and multilateral efforts to con-
trol the desert locust outbreak and the 
coordination among relevant U.S. Gov-
ernment agencies, regional govern-
ments, 
and 
international 
organiza-
tions, including the World Food Pro-
gram and the U.N. Food and Agricul-
tural Organization. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
SMITH for his leadership on this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to support H.R. 1079. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank my 
good friend and colleague, Congress-
woman KAREN BASS, the chair of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Africa, 
Global 
Health, Global Human Rights and 
International Organizations. We have 
worked so close on so many issues. 
Sometimes she takes the lead; some-
times I take the lead, but we are al-
ways striving for that same outcome, 
and I thank her for her great support 
for this. It really is an honor to work 
with the gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, given the incredible 
damage locusts can inflict in such a 
short time, it is critical that our abil-
ity to evaluate and respond to these 
outbreaks is efficient across our gov-
ernment, including the U.S. mission to 
the Food and Agriculture Organization 
and to the USAID. 
That is exactly what this bill will do 
to help support regions that were al-
ready struggling with food security 
from being further impacted by locust 
swarms consuming their crops. 
I thank the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Africa, 
Global 
Health, Global Human Rights and 
International Organizations, my col-
league, Representative SMITH, for in-
troducing this important bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
1079, as amended. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1036) to amend the State De-
partment Basic Authorities Act of 1956 
to authorize rewards under the Depart-
ment of State’s rewards program relat-
ing to information regarding individ-
uals or entities engaged in activities in 
contravention of United States or 
United Nations sanctions, and for other

There was no objection. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1036, the Bassam Barabandi Re-

gentleman from South Carolina, Con-
gressman JOE
WILSON, and the gen-
tleman from Florida, TED DEUTCH. 
Mr. Speaker, whistleblower programs 
have proven themselves effective over 
and over again. In 2017, the U.S. De-
partment of Justice collected $3.7 bil-
lion in settlements and judgments from 
False Claim Act cases against compa-
nies and individuals who had defrauded 
the government. Of the $3.7 billion, 92 
percent came from cases brought by 
whistleblowers. 
Whistleblowers 
have 
easier access to evidence of misdeeds 
than outside law enforcement inves-
tigators, deeper knowledge of the bad

actors engaged in unlawful behavior, 
and greater insights into the methods 
through which fraud or theft is being 
carried out. 
This bipartisan bill would authorize 
the Department of State to offer re-
wards for information about the iden-
tity or location of individuals who defy 
sanctions imposed by the United States 
or by the United Nations. 
This legislation builds on several ex-
isting programs that provide rewards 
of information leading to the arrest or 
conviction of criminals engaging in 
human trafficking, smuggling, or other 
transnational crimes. 
This bill will also increase compli-
ance with American and international 
sanctions 
programs 
and, 
therefore, 
serves 
a 
valuable 
role 
promoting 
human rights, good governance, and 
the rule of law around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. WILSON and 
Mr. DEUTCH for their diligent work on 
this legislation, and I encourage all 
Members to join me in supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Rewards for Justice Act intro-
duced by our good friends, JOE WILSON 
and Congressman DEUTCH. It is a good 
bipartisan bill, and I think it will real-
ly make a difference. 
The bill would expand the Rewards 
for Justice program at the State De-
partment to authorize rewards for indi-
viduals coming forward with informa-
tion on sanctions evasion practices. 
The bill was inspired by Bassam 
Barabandi, 
a 
Syrian 
defector 
and 
former diplomat at the Syrian embassy 
in Washington, who worked to provide 
passports to critics of the criminal 
Assad regime. 
For years after his defection, Bassam 
lobbied the U.S. Government with in-
formation on Syrian oligarchs close to 
Assad, detailing their sanctions eva-
sion 
practices. 
Bassam’s 
assistance 
highlighted the need to create a clear 
mechanism to incentivize individuals 
to come forward with this kind of vital 
information. 
The legislation will do just that and 
ultimately enhance compliance with 
U.S. and international sanctions, in-
crease confidence in the rule of law, 
and bring criminals and rogue regimes 
seeking to circumvent U.S. law to jus-
tice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is vital 
to helping the United States protect 
human rights and the rule of law 
around the world. 
By allowing the State Department to 
compensate individuals for bringing 
forward evidence of sanctions evasion 
and criminal misconduct by bad actors, 
America will be better equipped to 
punish those who flout the rule of law. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tives WILSON and DEUTCH for putting 
forward this key legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
1036. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until ap-
proximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 4 o’clock and 10 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the

AGEN-
CIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO, from the Committee 
on Appropriations, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 117–96) on the 
bill (H.R. 4502) making appropriations 
for the Departments of Labor, Health 
and Human Services, and Education, 
and related agencies for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for 
other purposes, which was referred to 
the Union Calendar and ordered to be 
printed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of 
order are reserved on the bill. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK 
MILLER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Coach Jack Miller of Tybee Is-
land, Georgia, who passed away on 
June 23 at the age of 91. 
Jack dedicated his life to mentoring 
and inspiring young athletes in the 
community. Jack’s head coaching ca-
reer started at Vidalia High School in 
1961 and would span 53 years at 11 dif-
ferent schools. He recorded over 700 
wins during his career. 
Jack was defined by his work ethic, 
which he passed along to his players. 
As a lifetime coach, mentor, and 
motivator, 
Jack 
earned 
numerous 
awards throughout his career, includ-
ing the Nike Coach of the Year Life-
time Achievement Award and the John 
F. Hodges Oasis Award for his out-
standing achievement in sports in Sa-
vannah. 
The only thing he loved more than 
coaching was his loving family and 
friends. 
Jack’s positive impact on his players 
went well beyond his athletic fields, 
and I know his legacy will remain. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and all those who knew 
him during this most difficult time. 
f 
ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
most of the colleagues of this House 
know that I have introduced H.R. 40, 
the Commission to Study Slavery and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can Americans Act, which can be de-
fined as repairing. 
I read to my colleagues an assess-
ment of the U.N. Human Rights chief 
in a landmark report, launched after 
the killing of George Floyd in the 
United States, urging countries world-
wide to do more to help end discrimina-
tion, violence, and systemic racism 
against people of African descent and 
to make amends to them, including re-
pair, reparations. 
That word strikes fear in most peo-
ple’s hearts and minds because they 
don’t take a moment to understand 
what ending systemic racism and insti-
tutional racism is or what repairing is. 
Repairing is a global concept. It means 
that if you have been harmed or there 
is something broken, you fix it. 
When you think about racism in the 
United States, it is something broken. 
There are many ways to address it: 
dealing with education and healthcare, 
dealing with the economy of people 
who have an enormous wealth gap, but 
breaching the gap and bringing people 
together. 
I ask my colleagues for us to move 
forward on H.R. 40 because it is healing 
legislation, and it will bring Americans 
together. 
f 
ENSURING U.S. REMAINS A 
LEADER IN TECH 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3003, the 
Promoting 
United 
States 
Wireless 
Leadership Act of 2021. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Michigan, Representative DINGELL, as 
well as my fellow 5G Caucus co-chairs, 
Congressman BILL JOHNSON and Con-
gresswoman ANN KUSTER, for working 
with me on this important legislation 
to enhance United States’ leadership in 
the development of wireless standards. 
H.R. 3003 directs the NTIA to assist 
and encourage participation by trusted 
companies, both large and small, in 
international 
telecommunications 
standards-setting bodies like 3GPP and 
IEEE. These independent business-led 
entities determine the standards by 
which 5G operators, equipment manu-
facturers, software providers, and oth-
ers build to. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
countries 
like 
China are increasingly asserting their 
influence in these bodies in order to 
skew tech standards toward Chinese- 
controlled companies and their tech-
nologies. 
We need a unified approach to push 
back against international competitors 
like Russia and China in order to pro-
tect U.S. national security, global com-
petitiveness, and cost-effectiveness of 
wireless communications. Our bill does 
just that. 
H.R. 3003 will undoubtedly help en-
sure the U.S. remains a leader in the 
future of tech. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. HARSHBARGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Hyde amendment. 
As a mother and grandmother of two 
precious grandsons, I am committed to 
protecting the life of the unborn. 
Since enacted, the Hyde amendment 
ban on taxpayer-funded abortions has 
saved nearly 21⁄2 million lives. We can-
not understate the importance of this 
amendment in saving these precious, 
innocent lives. 
I have taken care of young women 
with infertility problems for over 30 
years, and they would love to cradle a 
precious baby in their arms. So many 
want to discard that precious child as 
just an unnecessary interruption in 
their way of life. 
This is why we need to enact H.R. 18, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion 
Act, to ensure these pro-life protec-
tions remain in place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3660 
July 19, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
RISING INFLATION HURTS US ALL 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the on-
going economic crisis our Nation is 
facing. 
Study after study has found that the 
Democrats’ budget proposals attack 
every part of our economy, from gas 
prices to groceries to middle-class 
workers and small businesses. Ameri-
cans are struggling to make a living. 
Gas prices have skyrocketed to $3.15 
per gallon, the highest price for a gal-
lon of gasoline since 2014 and a 42 per-
cent increase from last year. As we 
continue to fall back into pre-pan-
demic routines, families hoping to 
travel this summer can’t afford the ris-
ing prices for fuel. 
I am also deeply concerned by the 
rising costs of everyday necessities. 
Over the past year, consumer prices 
have shot up 5.4 percent, reflecting the 
biggest increase since 2008, which was 
the last economic crisis the United 
States faced. 
The bottom line is that hardworking 
American families cannot withstand 
the negative impacts of rising infla-
tion. As long as this administration 
continues to spend trillions of dollars 
on failed policies, Americans will be 
left to foot the bill. I will continue to 
fight to ensure Oklahoma families and 
businesses do not suffer more in this 
economic crisis. 
f 
AMERICAN IDEAL WITHSTANDS 
TEST OF TIME 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, recently, 
I received an impassioned letter from 
Elizabeth Bradley, a young woman 
from Bessemer City, North Carolina, 
about the American ideal. 
In her letter, she writes: ‘‘The Amer-
ican ideal is the revolutionary thought 
that it is not by government, nor 
wealth, nor any human intervention 
that people have rights, but by the di-
vine power of God.’’ 
Ms. Bradley is exactly right, Madam 
Speaker. 
The American ideal has withstood 
the test of time because of those who 
put their faith in God’s plan rather 
than their own. 
Madam Speaker, let us never forget 
that we are one Nation under God, and 
the freedoms we proudly espouse are a 
gift that He has bestowed upon us.

b 1915 
HONORING DON PARRISH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 
storied career of Mr. Don Parrish as he 
celebrates his retirement as Senior Di-
rector of Regulatory Affairs at the 
American Farm Bureau Federation. 
Don is a champion and friend of the 
U.S. agriculture industry through and 
through. 
Don’s legacy spans a variety of top-
ics, but namely, he is renowned for his 
incredible work on the Clean Water Act 
and the waters of the U.S. 
Don’s role as an integral leader on 
this topic lead to his placement as 
chair of the Waters Advisory Coalition 
and to be named as a ‘‘Top 5 Player’’ on 
WOTUS in Politico. 
Anyone who knows Don knows his 
deep love for both his work and his 
family, whom he frequently brags 
about. 
The U.S. agriculture industry is bet-
ter today because of Don’s fierce dedi-
cation and advocacy. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Don for his 
partnership and for the outstanding 
work he has done to improve the liveli-
hood of America’s farmers and ranch-
ers. 
I wish Don a fulfilling retirement. He 
has earned every bit of it. 
f 
HELPING 
PEOPLE 
MAINTAIN 
THEIR PHONE NUMBERS IS A 
GOOD STEP TOWARD NORMALCY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to see that this week we are 
taking up H.R. 678, the PHONE Act. 
This bipartisan piece of legislation is 
common sense and helps real people 
after natural disasters. 
This bill would place a moratorium 
on phone companies reassigning peo-
ple’s landline phone numbers when 
their house is destroyed by a natural 
disaster, such as forest fires, which I 
am having so many of in my district. 
I have heard countless stories of peo-
ple whose houses are burned down in 
wildfires that continue to get charged 
for their landline phone number, or 
their number is reassigned to a new 
customer. 
This bill would help alleviate some 
stress and give people one less thing 
they have to deal with. 
I am proud to cosponsor a bill that is 
stepping up and providing a solution to 
help out wildfire victims and other nat-
ural disaster victims. 
The goal of recovery is to bring back 
a sense of normalcy, and helping people 
maintain their phone number is a good 
step. 
f 
STANDING WITH THE PEOPLE OF 
CUBA 
(Mr. WALTZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to stand with the people of Cuba. 
I rise today to stand with these brave 
people who are risking everything, 
their lives, their families, their liveli-
hoods. 
Standing for freedom in Cuba isn’t an 
academic exercise. They not only put 
their lives on the line, they put their 
entire family’s lives on the line. And as 
they do this they are reading from the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America, they are reading from the 
Declaration of Independence, they are 
waving the American flag. They are 
not waving flags of Europe or other 
countries. They are waving the Amer-
ican flag, the international symbol of 
freedom. 
Madam Speaker, socialism does not 
work, is not working, has never worked 
anywhere around the world. The only 
place in the world where the Cuban 
people are not succeeding is in Cuba. 
We must stand with them. We will 
stand with them. And the Cuban people 
will be free. 
f 
FREEDOM FOR CUBA 
(Mr. DIAZ-BALART asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
the people of Cuba are standing up for 
freedom, and they are suffering horrific 
consequences for it. They are getting 
murdered in the streets by the regime. 
They are getting killed in the streets 
by the regime. 
And what they are asking for are just 
a couple of things. And what I am 
pleading for right now with the Presi-
dent of the United States is for some 
solidarity. And, yes, he made a couple 
statements, but where is his leader-
ship? 
What the Cuban people need right 
now is access to the internet that has 
been cut off by the Cuban regime. The 
Cuban people are not asking for remit-
tances, they are not asking for aspirin, 
they are asking for freedom. 
This President ran saying that he 
was going renew a new era of American 
diplomacy. Why is he not rallying the 
world? Why is he not speaking about 
what is going on on the island of Cuba? 
Why is he not talking to the democ-
racies, making sure that everybody un-
derstands that it is an illegitimate ter-
rorist, murderous regime in Cuba, and 
the United States stands with the peo-
ple and is going to make sure that the 
world stands with the people of Cuba, 
as well?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3661 
July 19, 2021 
President Biden, this is a moment of 
leadership. Stand with the Cuban peo-
ple. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds Members to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. BRADY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly oppose Democrats’ 
cruel efforts to repeal the Hyde amend-
ment. 
My wife, Cathy, and I are proud par-
ents because of two women in difficult 
situations who chose life and, through 
adoption, gave us two loving sons. 
Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has 
saved the lives of nearly two and a half 
million innocent babies, and whether 
you are pro-abortion or pro-life, as I 
am, Americans have always agreed, 
Washington should not use their tax-
payer dollars to pay for and encourage 
abortion. 
Unfortunately, that is what Presi-
dent Biden is trying to do, repeal this 
important humanitarian protection of 
the innocent unborn. 
This is an affront to the majority of 
Americans who do not want their tax 
dollars to fund abortion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration on 
the House floor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships.

CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
SALAZAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
libertad. Freedom. Abajo la dictadura. 
Down with the dictatorship. 
These are the calls we are hearing 
from the people of Cuba. 
They have taken to the streets de-
manding the end of the Castro tyranny. 
We see the American flag waving on 
the streets of Havana because they 
yearn for the same thing we have: 
Freedom. We see the American flag 
waving on the streets of Havana be-
cause that is what they want, freedom. 
Castro has taken repression to sci-
entific levels. There are at this hour 
over 500 political prisoners and thou-
sands more are in jail. 
Madam Speaker, we are begging 
President Biden to stand with the Cu-
bans now. The Castro regime has cut 
off the internet so no one will see how 
they are torturing the Cuban people. 
America has the technology to provide 
internet now in Cuba. 
We don’t need any study groups 
about remittances. What we need is ac-
tion. We need the President to grant 
the green light now so that Cubans can 
organize among themselves and can 
stay in the streets; so they don’t feel 
abandoned; so they know the whole 
world is watching; so they can decide 
their own political future. Time is of 
the essence. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members to observe 
proper decorum. 
f 
WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT UPDATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
want to speak with the body here about 
the situation in the West with wildfire 
and drought. 
As so many of you know from the 
news, there is wildfire breaking out all 
over in the western States. My home 
State of California has several going on 
right now. I represent the very north 
part of the State, the First Congres-
sional District, and we have fires rou-
tinely reaching now the five-digit 
mark, including the newest one known 
as the Dixie fire; it is over 30,000 acres. 
My understanding is, there are 11,000 
new acres just last night burning up in 
the area of Feather River Canyon. 
But this is not, unfortunately, news 
this time of year in the West. Anything 
west of the Rocky Mountains pretty 
much seems to be on the line. 
What is going on is that for many 
years we in this country value the 
Smokey the Bear principle of putting 
out fires when they occur in the forest. 
And I think we still do value that. But 
what we haven’t done on the back side 
of that is to manage our forest lands. 
And so what we have seen in the dec-
ades since, a good-minded policy, a 
good-intended policy, is that the for-
ests have built up so much fuel. So 
much damage gets done from all this 
fuel being built up from fire season. It 
kind of creates its own drought situa-
tion inside the forest there when you 
have more inventory per acre than 
what the forest can sustain, especially 
during a drought period. And so in the 
West, in California, it is known you are 
going to have drought years, you’re 
going to have wet years. And it kind of 
goes with the program there. 
So I am disturbed that we can’t ad-
vance the ball more on really the type 
of forest management we need to be 
doing. We can sustain X amount of 
trees per acre, and this is depending on 
tree type, tree age, particular land-
scape, the particular weather pattern 
in a micro area, but if we are not doing 
that then we are going to see this year 
after year. 
So the U.S. Forest Service has kind 
of transitioned from—not that many 
years ago—about one-third of their 
budget would go for fire suppression 
and two-thirds for the good green work 
we call it, green harvest, permits, 
maintenance of forest roads and all the 
other things you do in the off season in 
order to make the asset protected from 
fire and also usable to the people, Be-
cause this is indeed the people’s asset. 
And they are getting less and less ac-
cess to it because of fire, but also just 
flat being closed down because of other 
environmental concerns that have been 
brought up. 
That is a key part of the argument 
here is that we have had hundreds of 
thousands of acres burned. I will just 
stick with California for a moment 
here. And simple projects after the fact 
when we are talking salvage, salvage 
timber that needs to be removed after 
a fire, if you do that within a reason-
ably soon amount of time after a fire 
then you can still get value out of that 
timber. If you do it soon. No more than 
a year would be ideal. 
But what happens is that when For-
est Service goes to try and contract or 
do some of the work post fire to re-
move trees that will be dead or are al-
ready dead but still have a salvage 
value, you can make a timber product 
out of that, they get sued. The environ-
mental groups come in and sue them 
saying, oh, we think you are going to 
take away habitat for the black-backed 
woodpecker or something like that. 
And indeed, what has already happened 
is the environment has already been 
ruined for quite a few years where the 
spotted owl might have been, where 
other owls might have been, or other 
wildlife had been. 
You should see some of the horrific 
pictures of how the wildlife is affected 
in a fire like this. And these are not 
just a slow-moving fire, but these con-
flagrations that we have these days 
that move from treetop to treetop 
across the whole landscape. 
And one of the saddest stories you 
will see is a rancher just right in my 
home county of Butte on the east side 
who wrote the story about how their 
family had been there for at least five 
generations and long-time ranchers 
there, and a fire whipped through there 
and took out so many of their live-
stock, but also the legacy, the land 
that they love has been ruined by fire 
in eastern Butte County, California, 
last year. 
b 1930 
So what are we going to do? Are we 
going to continue to watch this go on 
year after year after year? 
I have run legislation to try and 
make it just a little bit simpler to do 
basic, I think, commonsense idea of 
trimming around power lines, moving 
hazardous trees and foliage away from 
power lines. But that means you are 
going to have to cut some trees. That

July 19, 2021 
means you are going to have to do 
some trimming. You are going to have 
to do some actual work. The environ-
mental groups even sue over that. 
I am hearing reports that one of the 
latest fires might have been where a 
hazardous tree fell into a power line. 
Why can’t we create a zone around all 
power lines? The lines are already 
there—it is not like we are putting in 
new ones—to make it where there is 
enough distance around power lines so 
that if a tree does fall, it doesn’t fall 
into them, and you get two bad things: 
a fire and blackouts. 
So we will continue in Congress here 
to try and legislate that way. And I 
want to convince my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle that this is very 
important, because we are losing mil-
lions of acres every year to wildfire, 
losing millions of acres of habitat for 
wildlife, millions of acres of wood prod-
ucts. As you see with wood products, 
spiraling—through the roof. It has 
added $30,000 to $40,000 easily to the 
cost of a new home because of the high 
cost of wood products. Anybody that 
has been to any of the vendors to buy 
a piece of plywood or two-by-four, it af-
fects everybody. It isn’t just those 
building homes. 
I mean think about the folks that 
need—for other disasters, our friends 
that have to suffer hurricanes down 
there. Where do they get the plywood 
to be able to board up for that? We 
have to produce these products. We 
have to produce them domestically. We 
can’t import everything in this coun-
try. 
In my real life, I am a farmer. And 
we can’t continue to have the situation 
where we are going to rely on imported 
food or somehow replace our wood 
products. For some reason, the United 
States is the number two importer of 
wood of all countries. Why are we im-
porting wood when we have so much of 
an overload and over-inventory in our 
western States? So we should be em-
ploying our people and getting that 
material out. 
Now, people are going to be fearful 
that, Oh, you are talking about clear- 
cutting. No, it isn’t clear-cutting. That 
is the first thing they want to ask you 
when you have a press conference or 
something about it: ‘‘So you want to 
clear-cut everything.’’ No. We do this 
in zones. We do this with thinning. You 
do areas where you might do a 30-acre 
spot but then you plant it back, espe-
cially on private land. And you can tell 
what the private land is versus the 
Federal land that is basically almost 
not managed by flying over it after a 
fire or especially 5 years after a fire 
when you can see the checkerboard 
pattern you find so frequently of land 
ownership in forested areas. The pri-
vate lands have already reclaimed. 
They have already salvaged. They have 
already started planting back. You can 
see the green; you can see order coming 
back to those forests there. 
In the Federal land, you can still see 
the same snags. The same ghost trees— 
they call them—are there, left behind 
to—who knows when they will ever get 
around to it. 
And what does that mean? It propa-
gates the next fire, the next time light-
ning strikes, or the next flame blows 
through, or the next time there might 
be some kind of an accident. 
So I really, really want to get the at-
tention of my colleagues here in Con-
gress, those that regulate the forest, 
those in the U.S. Forest Service, and 
those of the American people, their at-
tention to what is going on, because 
this is not sustainable. It is not good. 
It is not good for anything I have 
talked about with wildlife, the asset 
the American people own in these Fed-
eral lands. 
And we must do something to address 
some things that might be inconven-
ient: cutting some trees—not all of the 
trees—you might have control burns 
during the correct time of the year to 
get rid of some of the slash. But on the 
positive side, why aren’t we using this 
biomass, taking this wooded material 
out here that doesn’t turn into a two- 
by-four or baseball bat, or what have 
you, and turning that into something 
useful that we can use to generate elec-
tricity. 
Heaven knows, we don’t have an 
oversupply of electricity generated in 
California. We even saw Texas was a 
problem last winter. So we are going to 
need to develop these sources, and that 
means jobs in these rural communities, 
jobs cleaning up the forests, any de-
pendable 24/7 electricity supply because 
you could control the fuel. Solar, you 
don’t control the fuel. You have to 
have a sunny day without clouds or 
have it not be nighttime. 
The wind machines, you can’t control 
them either. 24/7 fuel sources, whether 
it is hydro, whether it is new, whether 
it is natural gas, or biomass using 
these wooded products, we need to use 
for something positive anyway, we 
need to put them to work so we have a 
stable grid. 
Heaven knows, with all the new de-
mands that are being made by environ-
mental-minded people on more electric 
cars, getting rid of gas stoves, getting 
rid of gas water heaters—all for elec-
tricity. Where is all this electricity 
going to come from? We can be gener-
ating it with things that come from 
our forests with these byproducts, so 
we need to be putting them to work. 
So I just implore everybody that has 
a role in making a decision around 
here, in Congress, with our Federal 
agencies, environmental groups, could 
you please back off a little bit and let 
some of this good work happen. And 
the American people, listen to what we 
are talking about and encourage those 
folks that may be timid or not inclined 
to want to do the type of forest man-
agement, encourage your Member of 
Congress this has got to be done, be-
cause this air quality affects all the 
west. Last year, some of it even blew 
back all the way to the East Coast 
from fires that were happening in Cali-
fornia and the West. So we can do a 
heck of a lot better. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
time here tonight. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER), 
my good colleague. 
IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN ‘‘BAM’’ CARNEY 
Mr. 
COMER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize a great Kentucky Statesman 
and a true friend. This past weekend, 
Kentucky lost one of its best. My dear 
friend, and the former majority leader 
of the Kentucky House of Representa-
tives, Bam Carney. 
Bam represented his home county of 
Taylor and Adair County in the Ken-
tucky General Assembly for many 
years. He rose as high as majority lead-
er, and remained there and would have 
been there as long as he wanted to be 
majority leader until he fell ill. And 
those of us who have kept up with Bam 
over the past year and-a-half know 
that he fought a battle that few people 
could have fought over the past year 
and-a-half. 
I am sad to report that this past 
weekend, Bam passed away, but he will 
never be forgotten. The history books 
will write about Bam Carney, and they 
will talk about his role as majority 
leader of the Kentucky House of Rep-
resentatives. They will also talk about 
his role as a great educator, and a lead-
er for education in the Commonwealth 
of Kentucky. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take a few 
moments to recognize Bam Carney, my 
friend. When you are involved in poli-
tics, you get to meet a lot of political 
people. And I had the pleasure of serv-
ing in the Kentucky House of Rep-
resentatives with Bam Carney. I re-
member when he arrived in Frankfort, 
Kentucky, a few years after I got there. 
And Bam immediately made an impres-
sion on me. He wasn’t like everybody 
else in Frankfort. Bam was genuine. 
What you saw is what you got. Bam 
and I became very close friends. In 
fact, I considered Bam Carney one of 
my best friends. We worked together 
on legislation, our families became 
close, we played a lot of golf together. 
I never beat Bam, by the way. Not 
many people did beat Bam Carney on 
the golf course. But we became friends. 
He stayed at my house on weekends. 
We traveled together. Bam was some-
one that you could trust. Bam was 
someone that—in politics it is rare to 
say—but you always knew where he 
stood. And if he told you something, 
then that was good as gold because he 
stuck with his word. 
Bam wasn’t like most politicians. 
Bam didn’t want to hide from the con-
troversial issues or the tough issues, 
the issues that Bam knew might not be 
the most popular issues in his district. 
But Bam did what was right and what 
he felt was right for the people he rep-
resented. 
Bam was a career educator; a basket-
ball coach. Bam played college baseball

at Berea. Bam was a Christian. In fact, 
one of the last things that he said was 
he was ready to go to heaven. And I 
know that is where he is right now. 
Bam was a great brother, a great fa-
ther. Bam was a great leader, a great 
friend, just an all-around great person. 
Kentucky lost a great statesman this 
past weekend in Bam Carney. I hope 
that those of us who knew Bam can 
learn from the greatness of Bam Car-
ney, the great person he was, the great 
leader he was, and the great represent-
ative of the people that he was. Bam 
represented the people, not the special 
interests. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t say enough 
heartfelt things to Bam Carney’s fam-
ily: His mother, his brothers, his sister, 
his two sons. They have endured a lot 
over the past year and-a-half through 
Bam’s sickness, and they never left his 
side, never gave up hope; always having 
a positive attitude. Bam Carney is the 
kind of person that we all need in legis-
lative bodies, someone you can count 
on and someone that is honest and 
someone that is in the legislative body 
for the right reason. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
time today on the floor of the U.S. 
House of Representatives to recognize 
the great life of a great Kentucky lead-
er and a great Kentucky friend, Bam 
Carney. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES OTIS CATLIN 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. James 
Otis Catlin of Sebree, Kentucky, who 
passed away earlier this month—July 
9, 2021—at the age of 90. James was a 
hard worker throughout his life. He 
was a proud Korean War veteran, earn-
ing a Bronze Star and Purple Heart. 
His love for our country and service-
members continued after his military 
career, and he joined the Austin Collins 
American Legion Post 243 in 1952, even-
tually becoming its oldest member. 
James was a dedicated servant of the 
Lord and an active member of Sebree 
General Baptist Church. His humble 
service touched many in Webster Coun-
ty and all of Kentucky’s First Congres-
sional District. 
I will always be grateful for the sac-
rifice of our Nation’s heroes. I was 
proud to represent James in Congress, 
and his enduring legacy of service and 
faith will live on through his family, 
friends, and all those he impacted. 
HONORING MARK AND LORI WILSON 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, for 141 
years, on the first Saturday in August, 
people from all over Kentucky make 
their way to the small community of 
Fancy Farm in far Western Kentucky 
for the annual Fancy Farm picnic, 
hosted by St. Jerome Catholic Church 
in Graves County. 
Thousands gather to enjoy good food, 
good people, and good old-fashioned po-
litical stump speaking. Over 19,500 
pounds of pork and mutton are served, 
along with hundreds of pounds of fresh 
home-cooked vegetables and home-
made pies and cakes. All funds raised 
benefit St. Jerome Catholic Church for 
charitable endeavors. Additionally, the 
Fancy Farm picnic is entirely a com-
munity effort made up of local volun-
teers. 
Madam Speaker, today, I would like 
to honor two of those volunteers— 
Mark and Lori Wilson—for their 15 
years of service as chairs of the picnic- 
speaking committee. Mark and Lori 
have dedicated countless hours to 
make the Fancy Farm picnic a great 
success. 
I was especially honored when Mark 
and Lori asked me to serve as master 
of ceremonies at the 2012 Fancy Farm 
picnic when I was Kentucky’s commis-
sioner of agriculture. Their efforts to 
create a successful picnic every year 
are invaluable. 
Mark and Lori Wilson will be step-
ping aside and paving the way for new 
community leaders to step up and fill 
this role. However, I know that Mark 
and Lori will continue to be an active 
presence not only on the Fancy Farm 
stage, but in their proud Graves Coun-
ty community. I personally appreciate 
not only their years of service, but also 
their friendship. 
b 1945 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. COMER for his tribute to the 
good people of Kentucky and the serv-
ice you do there. They are served well 
by him and the work he does here in 
Washington, D.C. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to re-
sume for a few moments to what I was 
mentioning beforehand on forestry and 
the effects on our natural resources. 
Year after year, as I was mentioning, 
there are tens and hundreds of thou-
sands, even millions, of acres of wild-
fire affecting our habitat and air qual-
ity. What I didn’t get to touch on was 
water quality as well. 
You will find, when you burn these 
mountainsides, you burn those slopes, 
and indeed, with so much inventory on 
hand there of trees per acre and brush 
and other dead vegetative materials, 
when this all burns, it burns cata-
strophically. In a lot of cases, you get 
a moonscape that is left behind. With 
that, there is a great amount of ash 
and other material that, because it is 
on a mountainside and hillside, it even-
tually is picked up by the next rainfall 
and/or snowpack and washes down the 
whole 
watershed 
into 
our 
brooks, 
creeks, streams, rivers, and, eventu-
ally, the lakes that we have. 
This also creates a toxic environ-
ment, when you have that much ash 
material going down and almost actu-
ally plugging the lakes, for example. 
I talked to folks in the hydroelectric 
business there. With all that ash and 
soil erosion—really, the soil erosion is 
a big, big part of that, too—they have 
to go in and clear the bottom of the 
lakes in some cases to keep their hydro 
projects running. Otherwise, you have 
less and less electricity being gen-
erated and the cost of all that to the 
taxpayers and to those water rights 
holders, et cetera. 
When we talk about wildfire in the 
West, it isn’t just, yes, we lost a few 
trees and some deer got burned, some 
mountain lions and bear, and all that, 
which is all really important, but there 
is a lot more than meets the eye with 
all this. 
If we talk about the electricity grid 
for a moment, if the hydroelectric 
plants can’t operate—and we are al-
ready stretched the way we are for 
electricity in the country and in the 
West because the shift has been pushed, 
with so much emphasis on doing it all 
with solar or wind power because we 
want to fulfill these renewable ideals. 
They are fine. They are fine in their 
own segment, what have you, but they 
are not fulfilling that big of a percent-
age of our grid yet. 
We are still reliant upon a big part of 
our grid coming even as legacy from 
coal, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear. 
We are not just going to replace that 
overnight, and we are not going to do 
it, 
certainly, 
cost-effectively 
with 
these expensive forms of electricity. 
Everything still needs to remain on 
the table. It is very important that we 
are domestically in charge of our elec-
tricity generation, our energy, and our 
energy policy not relying on imported. 
The wildfire effects do have a wide 
ripple across a lot of our lives. It gets 
back to: Are we going to manage our 
forests, or are we going to watch them 
burn? 
Manage it means jobs for us. It 
means wood products that are grown 
domestically, paper products. Heaven 
knows, we use plenty of paper around 
here. Why not have that product come 
from something that is going to em-
ploy somebody and help make our for-
est a better place? 
For the power grid, we always seem 
to be on the edge, in the hot summer, 
of having to shut off. Indeed, they call 
it Flex Alert in California, where they 
are asking people to shut down the 
usage of electricity. They already con-
tract ahead of time with large manu-
facturers like the cement manufactur-
ers and others to say that we might 
need you—they are contracted ahead of 
time to shut down at a phone call, basi-
cally, saying: We are going to have to 
shut you off for the rest of the after-
noon. Stop that production and stop 
that work because the rest of our 
power grid is going to be in trouble if 
we 
don’t 
get 
these 
voluntary, 
precontracted sign-ups shut down. 
They are asking regular households 
to do that. I saw an alert the other 
day—it is almost hysterical—asking 
people to not charge their electric cars 
between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. This is at the 
same time we are getting the bum’s 
rush to say: Hey, convert to electric 
cars. 
California has a mandate to elimi-
nate new combustion engine cars by, I 
think, 2035. Just make it up out of no-
where, no more of those cars. 
Are we going to have a power grid 
that can do that? And then, do people 
want to buy these cars? Is it more than

just idealists who want to purchase 
these vehicles or more who want to 
just drive in the special high-occu-
pancy vehicle lane that has a sticker 
on it in California so you can use your 
car there? 
Is this what vehicle choice looks like 
for folks? I am not against them, but I 
don’t like having things crammed down 
people’s throats like that either. 
So, what are we going to do? Our for-
ests, our energy grid, all of these 
things work together. I was talking 
about the fires that break out because 
the trees and other foliage can come in 
contact with power lines, or a downed 
power line might light up a forest as 
well. 
We have to be wise about how we are 
managing these things. Forestry is re-
quired that takes that into account. 
Our power lines, we still need to de-
liver the power from where it is gen-
erated. We have so much hydroelectric 
power up in my area, yet they want to 
remove dams. They want to remove the 
dams that are making this clean, 100 
percent renewable power up in the 
Klamath Basin, where farmers this 
year are getting zero percent of their 
allocation of water—zero. 
How do you do that to a group of peo-
ple, just taking that away? Especially 
in the Klamath Basin, these farmers 
own the water rights for that Klamath 
Project that was built by the Federal 
Government, and Oregon, of course, 
has upheld that water right. Yet, the 
Federal Government muscles the water 
away anyhow, just muscles it away be-
cause it thinks it can. 
Agriculture in California has taken 
devastating hits on water supply this 
year. Some districts are as low as 5 
percent, and even others getting zero. 
Others are getting smaller cuts but 
still getting cut. 
In our State, we have many crops 
that we grow over 90 percent of what 
the United States uses. In my area, 
there are a lot of olives grown, table ol-
ives and olive oil. Imagine not being 
able to get that commodity and having 
to rely on imports totally for that be-
cause we don’t have a heads-up plan in 
this country that accounts for what we 
produce and should be producing. 
Our wood products need to come from 
the U.S. Our ag products need to come 
from the U.S. Our energy, so we can be 
self-sufficient, needs to come from the 
U.S. 
We need to store more water in the 
Western States so we can produce these 
things, so we can produce hydroelectric 
power, so we can produce these ag 
products. 
We 
have 
environmental 
groups pushing to tear dams out that 
are already in place, stretching our 
power grid, stretching the food that 
comes to your table. 
Just look them up. How many crops 
come from California that you rely on 
nationally that you wouldn’t get if 
they weren’t grown there, or we can 
turn to other countries to import 
from? 
There was kind of a popular saying or 
a bumper sticker amongst agriculture 
some years ago: If you like imported 
oil, you will love imported food. 
At what point are we going to wake 
up to this? Environmental groups are 
doing a lot of winning on this. Yet, at 
the end of the day, what they are push-
ing for doesn’t actually do much to 
help the species they claim to be sav-
ing. 
The delta smelt, which is part of the 
delta just east of the bay area in north-
ern California, since 1992, I think they 
have been usurping and taking away 
more and more water from agriculture, 
from human use, to run through the 
delta to try to keep the salinity level 
low, with the theory that will help the 
delta smelt. 
The population has continually de-
creased since that time to where, when 
they are out there doing surveys—they 
call them trawls. The last several sur-
veys, they haven’t found any. They are 
not finding the species. Yet, hundreds 
of thousands of acre-feet of water and 
more are just being flushed through 
the delta because they still have the bi-
ological opinions put out by somebody 
in government and somebody willing to 
sue to stop the ability of that water to 
be used properly, for people use or even 
a purpose that would be helpful for the 
economy. 
Why does it have to be this way? 
There is a page on Facebook that I 
would invite everybody to look at and 
to watch if you are interested at all in 
where your food comes from and why 
our resources in California and the 
West are being managed the way they 
are but especially with the intent being 
on our water supply in California. 
California water supply isn’t just im-
portant to California. It is important 
to the whole country for these fresh 
fruit and vegetable products, the nut 
crops, and other things that are pro-
duced there that are not produced any-
where in this country otherwise or in 
very, very tiny percentages elsewhere. 
All of your almonds pretty much 
come from California. Yet, there is all 
this rhetoric out there, like the al-
monds are using all the water, that we 
are exporting all the water. No, the 
water doesn’t actually leave the State. 
Each almond nut doesn’t have that 
much water in it. It goes back into re-
charging the groundwater. It goes back 
into keeping the local economy grow-
ing those trees that replace CO2 with 
oxygen. 
Madam Speaker, I would like for you 
to check out this page on Facebook. It 
is called the California Water for Food 
and People Movement. A young lady 
named Kristi Diener on there puts out 
excellent information all the time on 
all the different aspects of California 
water and why that is important to ev-
erybody. 
We have the possibility of adding 
more water supply to our States. We 
could raise the Shasta Dam located in 
Shasta County near Redding, Cali-
fornia, far up north. You could raise it 
18 feet and augment it by about 630,000 
acre-feet of additional water supply 
when you fill the lake. 
Also, another one called Sites Res-
ervoir in the western part of the Sac-
ramento Valley, it is about 70 to 80 
miles south of the Shasta Dam. That 
would mean up to 1.5 million acre-feet 
of water that could be stored there 
when you fill that project. 
Those chunks of water would go a 
long way toward helping to keep the 
crops growing, as well as people’s needs 
and cities. 
It is my view, as low as the lakes are 
getting right now, Lake Shasta, Lake 
Oroville, Lake Folsom, San Luis Res-
ervoir, where water is transferred to 
after having been pumped through the 
delta—except they can’t because the 
State pumps and the Federal pumps 
are hardly running because they think 
they are helping the delta smelt. If 
these reservoirs are all full, we can go 
up to 5 years if we are not wasting the 
water on biological things that don’t 
make sense. 
We need to do a lot more to augment 
our water supply so we can keep grow-
ing the crops and have an economy of 
domestically grown products that are 
high quality and that people enjoy. 
And they won’t know they are missing 
it until you can’t get it. 
For seeing good information, on this 
Facebook page, the California Water 
for Food and People Movement, check 
into that because it is at least a 
counterargument to what you hear all 
the time in the press and in the news 
about what farmers are doing or how 
water storage is bad and how dams are 
bad. 
Dams, you get several good things by 
their existence. You get stored water 
for people in ag, as well as water that 
would not exist in summertime or in 
the fall that you could help with fish 
flows. Imagine that? You get hydro-
electric generation. You get prevention 
against floods because you can store 
this water during the wild rainy season 
and keep that. 
The Army Corps of Engineers runs 
those 
operations 
for 
flood 
control 
around the country. Imagine the flood-
ing you would have in those regions 
that can have that high flow during ex-
traordinary rain events. 
You get recreation. You get a lot of 
good things from storing water, and we 
used to do that. We used to think 
ahead to do that. Now, we think we are 
getting ahead by tearing out this infra-
structure that people need and actually 
can be beneficial and is beneficial to 
nature as well. 
We have to start thinking soundly 
and logically about what we are doing. 
That is why I have spent so much time 
on the Agriculture Committee, the 
Natural Resources Committee, and the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee talking about these issues. 
We have an opportunity with an infra-
structure bill or two or three coming 
up here to do some real things in that. 
b 2000 
I think most people when they think 
of infrastructure are thinking of our

highways, 
the 
basic 
transportation 
they use every day. They are thinking 
of things like levies, whether that is in 
my area of northern California or Lou-
isiana or all around the country, that 
help prevent floods and keep water 
where we want it instead of where we 
don’t want it, and water storage itself, 
the dams that make so much possible, 
as I mentioned, hydroelectric power, 
stored water, recreation, and flood con-
trol. It just makes sense. 
Why aren’t we getting back to a sen-
sible way of thinking about that? 
We are just letting the environ-
mental groups and the press—they 
seem to want to cozy up to their argu-
ment and not get the counter side to 
this. 
Meanwhile, I have many constituents 
who aren’t farming at all this year, not 
growing crops and doing that honest, 
good work that they have done for gen-
erations. These are good, hardworking 
people. Sometimes I wonder why they 
keep doing it because they don’t seem 
to be appreciated for what they are 
doing. It is always a fight. They always 
have got to be heading into town to de-
fend something, defend their water sup-
ply, defend their land uses, or defend 
against some more regulations thought 
up by somebody in Sacramento or in 
Washington, D.C., who really doesn’t 
understand or seem to care about why 
they do what they do. 
It makes this hard sometimes be-
cause as a Representative I go back 
home, and I tell them: We are not hav-
ing any really great answers coming 
out of Washington, D.C., lately. 
Under the Biden administration they 
are talking about pushing to reinstall 
the WOTUS regulations, the Waters of 
the United States. There are those in 
the Federal Government and environ-
mental movements who think that 
every drop of rainfall somehow belongs 
to the Federal Government or State 
government for them to regulate. 
Madam Speaker, you have people try-
ing to collect rainwater off their roofs 
into rain barrels and getting in trouble 
for that sometimes. The water running 
off their driveway, they can’t corral 
that water. They can’t build a stock 
pond to keep water for their stock be-
cause somehow that is affecting the 
whole water table or the whole water 
system. That is how far they want to 
interpret things—Waters of the United 
States. 
I tell you what, Madam Speaker, not 
everything belongs to the government. 
We have operated agriculture in this 
country for 200 years and done pretty 
well for the most part, and we are al-
ways working to improve and have bet-
ter, more efficient water usage, better 
fertilizers, developing herbicides and 
things that leave less of a footprint be-
hind or zero footprint behind and still 
produce a safe crop. 
People really should be asking ques-
tions. Ask these questions of the Biden 
administration. Ask them of the EPA. 
Ask them in your home State, Madam 
Speaker, as you see this stuff going on. 
Where are we going to get our food 
supply? 
Where are we going to get our elec-
tricity supply? 
Where are we going to get our wood 
supply? 
Where are we getting our fuel from? 
Enjoy this $4 fuel—almost $5 as I saw 
on the way to the airport today in Sac-
ramento. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
We need pipelines, we need domesti-
cally produced energy, and we can do it 
ecologically soundly. This isn’t new 
ground. This isn’t the 1850s or the 1860s 
when they hydraulic mined old moun-
tain sides and they killed all the buf-
falo and cut all the trees. We are way 
smarter than that. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, you would still 
think that from the way the media 
covers it and the way the environ-
mentalists talk about it in their groups 
and their fundraising pushes that it is 
the 1860s all over again. It isn’t. We are 
pretty wise about how we manage our 
resources for our farms. 
These are our families’ legacies. 
Why would we not take care of them? 
Why would we not take care of the 
soil? 
We do. We can do it better than any 
of those folks with their wide-eyed 
ideas who come around saying: ‘‘We 
could put your land into a long-term 
legacy that we help control,’’ and pret-
ty soon you are eating from their hand 
on how you manage your own farm, 
how you manage your own land, or 
maybe you decide to manage not to 
farm it for a while. You might be re-
quired to farm it anyway because it is 
now a habitat. 
Where did all this come from? 
Don’t we trust rural people anymore 
to make good decisions? 
Don’t we trust these people who work 
from sunup to sundown who provide for 
us from their heart and from their 
soul? 
Don’t we trust them? 
Do we trust bureaucrats in D.C. or 
Sacramento or other State capitals? 
I don’t. Not anymore. 
We have got to do better, and it is 
going to take the American public get-
ting behind this, not just politicians 
here and not just ones locally because 
sometimes they are hesitant, and they 
are afraid to. We have to be bold. We 
have to be loud about this. And we 
have to speak up every 2 years at elec-
tion time if they are not doing it be-
cause we are in big trouble right now. 
If California doesn’t get above aver-
age rainfall next year, I don’t know 
how much of agriculture is going to be 
in business. The lakes are getting to be 
at record low pretty soon. If California 
is not farming nearly to the percentage 
of what it does, it will affect everybody 
in this country. They will see it in 
prices, and they will see it in avail-
ability. 
Look at the store shelves already, 
how hard it is to keep certain things on 
the shelf when you go in and ask for it 
and it is not there, Madam Speaker. In 
restaurants if you ask for certain menu 
items, they are not even there. 
I went through a drive-through the 
other day, and half the items weren’t 
available. 
What is going on in production? 
Yes, we know it has been a year of 
COVID, but production of basic hard 
items, car parts, any other manufac-
tured item, nobody is going to work, or 
nobody can get the resources mined 
and shipped and made into an end prod-
uct that people need. 
We have to wake up here. 
What is going on that the means of 
production we are either exporting it 
or we are shutting it down and we are 
putting the clamps on it? 
Heaven knows $6 trillion out of thin 
air spending last year because of the 
COVID mess, and yet trillions and tril-
lions more are being proposed and 
sought to be spent upcoming on things 
that are not going to produce a re-
bounding, stronger economy but in-
stead fulfill political goals. 
What are we doing? 
They are still pursuing high-speed 
rail in California—something the vot-
ers were told would cost $33 billion 
when it was voted on, I think in 2008, 
$33 billion the voters were told. That 
price now is over $120 billion. It is only 
partially done. It is going to stop in an 
orchard somewhere around Bakersfield 
and go to another town in the northern 
part of the valley there where it will be 
a full rail line. For a $120 billion price 
tag we could build three large dams 
and lakes, and California would not be 
worried about water supply once those 
were built and filled. 
Yet 
we 
chase 
these 
boondoggle 
things, either to fulfill campaign prom-
ises or some kind of idea of that some-
thing will be green and environmental. 
We are not going to have the resources 
we need the way we are going to fulfill 
the power grid for the amount of elec-
tricity that needs to be produced. We 
are not going to have it. We are going 
to wake up someday with electric cars 
that won’t go and appliances that 
won’t turn on because of shortsighted 
thinking. 
Do the math, Madam Speaker. We 
have got to do the math and hold ac-
countable the people who are spreading 
this misinformation. If it just doesn’t 
seem right or sensible to you, Madam 
Speaker, trust your little voice. Trust 
your instinct on that because when 
this stuff doesn’t add up, you are prob-
ably right. It doesn’t. I have seen it 
enough around here to know it doesn’t 
add up long-term. 
I don’t normally do this open mic 
business here, but I am watching my 
constituents being burned out of where 
they live. I am watching them being 
pushed out by an economy that doesn’t 
support what they used to produce of 
things that people need and people used 
to need and still will need. I am watch-
ing normal, hardworking Americans 
feeling a little hopeless right now, and 
I don’t feel great about it because there 
is not more I can do as one of 435 in 
this room to help fix it.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
runaway costs and surging inflation 
are a huge worry for middle-class fami-
lies. Every survey confirms it. Every 
conversation confirms it. 
Over the last 12 months, during this 
economic recovery, the average Amer-
ican worker earned a 3.6-percent raise, 
but inflation has risen so steeply that 
it has turned that into a nearly 2-per-
cent pay cut. 
Remember, at the beginning of the 
year, the Biden administration inher-
ited a historically strong economic tra-
jectory. Thanks to the smart, targeted, 
bipartisan policies we passed last year, 
our economy was primed to get mil-
lions of Americans back to work with 
competitive pay while consumers un-
leashed pent-up demand. But, alas, 
that was before Democrats decided to 
pour $2 trillion into a long list of lib-
eral pet projects and insisted on mak-
ing it less appealing for workers to ac-
tually go back to work. 
Today, essentials like gas and gro-
ceries have gotten more and more ex-
pensive. Bigger purchases consumers 
had put off during the pandemic are 
getting even further out of reach. 
Across the country, working families 
and employers alike are feeling the 
pinch, an effective tax increase on both 
the wages and the savings of the mid-
dle class. 
Now, our colleagues weren’t flying 
blind. They weren’t naive. They knew 
they were passing what the White 
House Chief of Staff said was designed 
to be ‘‘the most progressive domestic 
legislation in a generation.’’ And they 
knew the risks, which one liberal econ-
omist described as ‘‘inflationary pres-
sures of a kind we have not seen in a 
generation.’’ 
Sure enough, inflation just clocked 
the fastest year-on-year increase since 
2008, but, apparently, according to 
President Biden himself, the solution 
is—listen to this—even more of the 
same. Today, instead of deflecting at-
tention from the fact that his adminis-
tration’s springtime approach was flat 
wrong, the President actually doubled 
down. He suggested the right way to 
shake this inflation was—listen to 
this—another $3.5 trillion in spending. 
This is the same reckless taxing and 
spending spree the Democrats dreamt 
up when they assumed our economy 
would be having the opposite problem. 
But now all that same borrowing, 
printing, and spending is supposed to 
be what the doctor ordered to fight in-
flation? 
Inflate our way out of inflation. Let’s 
hope the American people don’t have to 
learn 
firsthand 
how 
that 
strategy 
would work out. Another multitrillion- 
dollar reckless taxing and spending 
spree, believe me, is the last thing 
American families need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4938 
July 19, 2021 
ELECTION LAWS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on an entirely different matter, a 
few months ago, a group of Democrats 
and leftwing activists brought the 
State of Georgia into the national 
spotlight. Tremendous outrage, an air 
of total crisis, was cooked up, cooked 
up out of nowhere. 
The State of Georgia was passing a 
mainstream, 
commonsense 
election 
law. It combined widely popular integ-
rity protections, protections like voter 
ID, with a great deal of flexibility and 
availability to make voting easy. It 
codified more flexible early voting and 
more flexible mail-in voting than many 
Democratic-run States offer—for exam-
ple, New York. 
Americans want to make it easier to 
vote and harder to cheat. Voter ID, for 
example, is popular with majorities of 
Black, White, and Hispanic Americans. 
But in their ongoing bid to mount a 
Washington DC takeover of our Na-
tion’s elections, Democrats seized on 
this mainstream law and decided to 
start shouting that the sky was falling 
down in Georgia—the sky is falling 
down in Georgia. 
Unfortunately, for the people of 
Georgia, many people in the press and 
corporate America bought it. They got 
Major League Baseball to move its all- 
star game out of Georgia. Actual work 
opportunities, actual prosperity for 
working people, were sacrificed to 
serve this faked hysteria. 
Well, today, Georgians got what you 
might call a very weak consolation 
prize. Today, a week after the all-star 
game was supposed to happen in At-
lanta, Democrats themselves descended 
on the State to stage a bit of partisan 
theater. Last week, the traveling road 
show was Texas Democrats coming 
here to Washington to beg Senate 
Democrats to seize power away from 
their own citizens and local govern-
ments. 
This week, it was our own colleagues’ 
turn to get on the jets, but the rhetoric 
was just as hysterical and the conclu-
sion all the same: Washington Demo-
crats need to grab unprecedented power 
and rewrite all 50 States’ election laws. 
It is the same shtick we have been 
hearing here in this Chamber for mul-
tiple years now. 
Remember, their sweeping takeover 
bill was written long, long before any 
of the State laws which they now claim 
are prompting it. This phony outrage is 
wearing thin on the American people. 
Citizens know it isn’t attacking democ-
racy to have things like commonsense 
voter ID and commonsense voter list 
maintenance alongside lots of early 
voting, lots of mail-in voting, and lots 
of election-day voting. 
That kind of combination isn’t an at-
tack on democracy; it is the definition 
of democracy. It is exactly what Amer-
icans want. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 
response to the minority leader’s state-
ment about the changes in voting laws 
across America, the record speaks for 
itself. I believe the number is 17—17 
States which have set out to specifi-
cally 
limit 
previous 
opportunities 
under law to vote. 
Is it a coincidence that 17 States 
would do these things? I don’t think so. 
I think it is by design. That is why the 
Senate Rules Committee was in Geor-
gia today, to talk specifically about 
the measures that they took after the 
last election. 
Remember, this is all being done in 
the context of a former President, the 
sorest loser in the history of the 
United States, and his Big Lie about 
what was wrong with the last election. 
Well, I can tell you what was not 
wrong with the last election. In many 
States, the turnout broke records. 
More Americans eligible to vote turned 
up to vote, and that is a good thing in 
a democracy. 
When it comes to allegations of 
fraud, all of the money that has been 
spent on lawsuits, all of the allegations 
of voter fraud that have been inves-
tigated, it turns out to be a handful of 
cases, maybe a dozen out of millions of 
votes cast in the United States. So 
there is no argument for changing elec-
tion voting laws based on fraud. There 
certainly is no argument when it 
comes to the outcome of the election. 
That was clear, and it has been to ev-
eryone except one former President for 
a long time. Yet the Republicans, when 
in control of State legislatures, are by 
design trying to make it more difficult 
for some people to vote. Why? The an-
swer is very simple: The demographics 
of America are not on the side of the 
Republican Party. 
The new voters in this country are 
moving away from them, away from 
Donald Trump, away from their party 
creed that they preach. Instead, they 
are moving to be Independents or even 
vote on the other side. To argue and 
fight against that, the Republicans in 
legislative settings are reducing and 
restricting the opportunity to vote. 
That is what it is all about. 
The 
Senator 
from 
Kentucky 
at-
tributes it to hysteria. It is not. It is a 
genuine concern over whether in this 
country, where democracy is our creed 
and our goal in every election, we have 
the most participation, fair participa-
tion, by eligible voters that we have 
ever had, and we continue to build on 
that. 
f 
DREAM ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on a 
separate issue, I cannot imagine what 
life would be like if I were a kid grow-
ing up in America, always wondering if 
something I said, something I did, 
some action that was taken by some 
member of my family would result in a 
knock on the door and my family being 
torn apart, my father or mother being 
deported to another country. But for 
hundreds of thousands of young people 
living in America, that has been the re-
ality of their childhood. 
Most of them, brought to this coun-
try at a very early age—infants and 
toddlers and young people—had noth-
ing to say about the choice of America 
as home, but they always assumed it 
was their home. They grew up in this 
country, went to the schools, got up 
every morning in the classroom and 
pledged allegiance to the flag, believ-
ing they were truly Americans. It 
wasn’t, for many of them, until their 
teenage years that their parents sat 
down with them very quietly and sol-
emnly told them: You have a challenge 
in your life you didn’t even realize. 
You 
are 
undocumented. 
You 
were 
brought to this country by us as a lit-
tle kid, and you don’t have any papers. 
If you are challenged, if you are ar-
rested, you could be deported. And the 
same thing might just happen to your 
mother or your father. 
I can’t imagine, with all of the stress 
of childhood and adolescence, having 
that worry as well. Yet, for hundreds of 
thousands of young people, through no 
fault of their own, that was part of 
their lives. 
That came to my attention 20 years 
ago, a case in Chicago, which I have 
spoken about on the floor many times, 
where a young girl finally realized at 
the end of high school the really stark 
choices she had in her life, and she 
reached out to my office. We looked 
into the situation. She was brought 
here to the United States, born in 
Brazil to Korean parents, had no legal 
status in the United States and grew 
up here. She wanted to know what to 
do with her life, what was next for her. 
The law was very harsh, but it was 
clear as well. At the age of 18, our law 
said to Tereza Lee, a young Korean girl 
in Chicago, you have to leave the 
United States for 10 years and petition 
to return. It didn’t seem right or fair 
or just to her, and so I introduced the 
DREAM Act. That is when I came to 
realize Tereza’s story was not unique. 
There were thousands just like her. 
Over the last 20 years, I have met a lot 
of them, an amazing group of young 
men and women who have done re-
markable things with their lives with 
limited resources and always under the 
shadow of deportation. 
The DREAM Act has been brought to 
the floor of the Senate five different 
times and failed—not because it didn’t 
win a majority but because of the fili-
buster. So we have tried in those 20 
years to get something done, and we 
have had our really troublesome mo-
ments. I think back to one of the 
worst. 
Under the previous President, Donald 
Trump, DACA, a program created by 
President Obama for these Dreamers, 
was really an issue from the start that 
we begged President Trump to con-
sider. President Obama, a friend of 
mine and former colleague from Illi-
nois, told me that he spent an extra

hour 
in 
transition 
with 
President 
Trump in the White House, while 
Obama was still President. It was sup-
posed to last an hour; it lasted 2 hours. 
He said to me: I spent that last hour 
talking about DACA and Dreamers, 
telling him how important it was to 
get this right, that these young people 
deserved a chance, and he listened very 
intently. President Obama said: ‘‘I 
hope that he will help you when it 
comes to these Dreamers.’’ 
The first time I ever met Donald 
Trump was on his Inauguration Day as 
President, not too far from here at a 
luncheon, and the first thing I said to 
him was, I hope you will give those 
Dreamers a chance to become part of 
America. 
He 
said: 
Senator 
DURBIN, 
don’t 
worry. I am going to take care of those 
Dreamers. 
In the first year of his Presidency, he 
tried to abolish the DACA Program and 
subject these Dreamers to deportation. 
It was a very dark period. For many of 
them, they were despondent. Several of 
them said they couldn’t take it any-
more, the pressure they were under to 
create a life in America under the 
shadow of deportation and now have a 
President who was really determined 
to make them leave America. 
Well, the courts took a look at what 
President Trump had to do, all the way 
up to the Supreme Court across the 
street. It was Chief Justice Roberts 
who wrote the decision, which said the 
method that Donald Trump’s adminis-
tration used to eliminate DACA was 
stricken as ‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’ 
So there was a new lease on life and 
a new opportunity for them, until Fri-
day—when the Federal judge in Texas 
made the most recent ruling. On Fri-
day night, a Federal judge in Texas 
issued a ruling declaring that the De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or 
DACA, was unlawful, and the judge 
blocked the Biden administration from 
approving new DACA applications, a 
new setback for the Dreamers. 
This decision was made in response 
to a lawsuit filed by Republican State 
attorneys general. It was the culmina-
tion of a long campaign, which in-
cluded the action of President Trump, 
by Republicans to deport the Dream-
ers. What is it about these young peo-
ple that infuriates the Republicans so 
much? Well, I will tell you what I 
found as I have come to know them. 
They are some of the most amazing 
stories you could imagine. Not just the 
threat that I mentioned earlier, the 
shadow of deportation over their lives, 
but what they have done anyway—be-
coming doctors and nurses and teach-
ers and engineers, serving in our Army, 
working for America in essential jobs 
in the midst of a pandemic. It is an 
amazing group of people. It is just the 
kind of people we want and need for the 
future of this country. 
But let me state this unequivocally: 
The cruel and misguided decision of 
this court will not stand. DACA is a 
lawful exercise of executive prosecu-
torial discretion by the Department of 
Homeland Security. More than 800,000 
young people in our country have re-
ceived DACA protection, and they help 
save lives every day as nurses and doc-
tors and first responders. They con-
tribute to our economy and our future 
as business owners, engineers, and 
teachers. They are a vital part of our 
communities as friends, family mem-
bers, and loved ones. America is the 
only home these Dreamers have ever 
known, and Congress has waited long 
enough—in fact, it has waited too long 
to allow them to finally become Amer-
ican citizens. 
Friday’s ruling is yet another re-
minder of the hell that these young 
people have put up with over the past 
two decades. Under the Trump admin-
istration, Dreamers endured one attack 
after another. 
When former President Trump at-
tempted to repeal DACA, it put hun-
dreds of thousands of young people at 
risk of being deported to countries 
they didn’t even remember. 
When the Supreme Court ruled that 
the former President’s repeal of DACA 
was unlawful, he simply defied the 
Court’s decision and stopped DACA ap-
plicants from being approved. For 
months, President Trump refused to re-
open the program for new applicants 
despite the clear direction of the U.S. 
Supreme Court. Approximately 300,000 
of these young people were unable to 
receive the protections they deserved 
because of President Trump’s unilat-
eral, hateful action. 
In response to a court order, DACA 
was finally reopened for the new appli-
cants in December, but now, just as the 
Biden 
administration 
is 
processing 
these applications, the door was shut 
again in the Federal court in Texas on 
Friday. 
In the words of one Dreamer, Adonias 
Arevalo, ‘‘It’s such an uncertainty, not 
to be able to plan my life.’’ 
Thankfully, 
President 
Biden 
has 
vowed to appeal this decision, but we 
need to prevent conservative judicial 
activists on the bench, politicians in 
black robes, from striking down the 
President’s lawful efforts to protect 
Dreamers. Congress cannot wait any 
longer. 
America 
cannot 
wait 
any 
longer. Senate Democrats need to pro-
vide a permanent legislative solution 
for the Dreamers. We need to act swift-
ly. 
I hope that my Republican colleagues 
with conscience will think long and 
hard about whether they are going to 
stand in the way of the Dreamers at 
this moment in history. We need their 
help, and not just some halfhearted 
symbolic attempt but genuinely to give 
these young people a fighting chance to 
make America a better nation. 
To all the Dreamers out there, I 
promise you, we will work as hard as 
necessary to get this job done as quick-
ly as possible. 
NATIONALS PARK SHOOTING 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on 
Saturday night, baseball fans at Na-
tionals Park here in Washington, DC, 
not far from where we stand, were sent 
into a panic by a sound that has be-
come all too familiar in American cit-
ies: the sound of gunfire. 
In the middle of the sixth inning, the 
teams left the field when it was re-
ported that three people were shot out-
side the stadium on South Capitol 
Street. That burst of gunfire reverber-
ated throughout the stadium. It could 
be heard on television and radio broad-
casts of the game. It was bad; it could 
have been worse. Thankfully, nobody 
inside the stadium was harmed, and 
many thanks to the first responders for 
keeping the attendees safe. 
But the photos and videos from Sat-
urday night tell a clear story. We are a 
nation that has become traumatized by 
gun violence. 
The Fourth of July weekend, the city 
of Chicago, a city I dearly love and am 
honored to represent, there were 104 
gunshot 
victims 
that 
weekend, 
19 
deaths. 
We have come to accept, sadly, mass 
shooting as a possibility anywhere in 
America, at a baseball park, in a movie 
theater, in houses of worship, even in 
our schools. 
Mass shootings happen on the streets 
of Chicago almost every weekend. Just 
this last weekend, more than 50 were 
shot in our city, including 7 children 
and teenagers. The sad reality is gun 
violence has become as American as 
baseball. 
The question before this Senate 
again and again and again is, Will we 
do anything about it? Will we take 
minimum steps to reduce gun violence 
in America, steps like making it more 
difficult for convicted felons and unsta-
ble people to buy firearms? 
Nearly 
every 
American 
supports 
that, and yet the gaps in the Federal 
gun laws continue. Right now, it is 
simply too easy for a convicted felon or 
person with a history of serious mental 
illness to buy a gun from an unlicensed 
dealer. A person—no questions asked— 
can easily buy a gun from an unli-
censed seller just minutes away from 
the city of Chicago, in the State of In-
diana, and that gun will be sold and re-
sold many times over in our city of 
Chicago—many times the same day. 
In March, the House passed H.R. 8, a 
bipartisan measure to close the gaps in 
our background checks system. Sen-
ator CHRIS MURPHY of Connecticut and 
Senator MANCHIN of West Virginia have 
been leading negotiations to get bipar-
tisan support for that bill in the Sen-
ate. I am waiting for their signal, and 
I hope to receive it—that we are ready 
to move on that legislation. 
I hope Senate Republicans will join 
us in supporting this and other com-
monsense measures, like confirming a 
Director for the Agency that enforces 
the gun laws on the book—ATF—for 
the first time since 2015. Too many 
lives have been lost to gun violence in

this country. It is time for us to come 
together and put an end to the sense-
less violence. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am starting to feel a little bit 
like a broken record. I am here on the 
floor again to echo the concerns of my 
constituents and so many folks across 
our great country. People across the 
country are cautiously checking their 
bank accounts, and they are looking at 
the price of milk, bread, and things 
that they have to buy every day. They 
are driving out of their way to see 
which gas stations even have gas, and 
when they do find that, they are look-
ing for the lowest price. 
Just as we are starting to come out 
of the pandemic, prices are starting to 
rise, and our dollar isn’t going as far. 
Why? Because the Democrats want to 
spend their way out of a pandemic, and 
it really makes no sense. They are 
throwing trillions around like it is Mo-
nopoly money. It is not targeted to 
those who need it the most. It is on 
policy items that only appease their 
base—the far left—not even a majority 
of their party. They are flooding the 
zone with borrowed money like a credit 
card with no limit. They did it with 
their stimulus package earlier in the 
year, and it was disguised as a COVID 
relief package. Now they are getting 
ready to try the same thing again. 
Last 
week, 
Leader SCHUMER
an-
nounced 
that 
the 
Democrats 
had 
reached an agreement on a budget rec-
onciliation resolution, which is like 
the pregame warm-up to the next rec-
onciliation package. The pricetag for 
that agreement has been set at $3.5 
trillion. Let me take a minute to high-
light what I think is wrong with the 
bill. 
First of all, I am not sure how any-
one can call this an agreement. One 
Democratic Senator, who doesn’t ap-
pear to have been consulted on the so- 
called agreement in the first place, 
said the package needs to be fully paid 
for. Let me translate that to you. That 
means we need tax increases. Last 
week, we talked about the 30 new tax 
increases that will probably be in this 
bill. On the other hand, we have Demo-
cratic Senators saying it is OK if this 
package adds to the deficit—$3.5 tril-
lion added to the $30 trillion that we 
are already in debt. We already know 
at least one Senator wants the top-line 
number to be as much as $6 trillion 
while others are calling for $2 to $3 tril-
lion, which, by the way, is still too 
much spending. 
It doesn’t seem like everyone has 
fully 
committed 
to 
this 
so-called 
agreement. It appears the Democrats 
are in disarray when it comes to agree-
ing to this. Announcing there is an 
agreement when they still have Mem-
bers of their own party arguing over 
the final top-line number and how it 
will be paid for is a pretty interesting 
strategy. The only thing I can guess is 
that the strategy is really to pull the 
wool over all of our eyes. Trying to sell 
the agreement of a top-line number as 
a win is like saying that you have won 
the game after the first snap. 
Folks, you have to play the game. 
You can’t go by the first quarter’s re-
sults. You have to play the entire 
game. 
Second, I can’t understand why some 
of my colleagues across the aisle are 
still trying to sell this tax and spend-
ing bill as human and soft infrastruc-
ture. Most people have never heard of 
that. I haven’t been up here long, but I 
know enough to know there is really 
no such thing as human and soft infra-
structure. For some reason, we keep 
adding definitions to Webster’s Dic-
tionary. It appears that our Demo-
cratic colleagues have, once again, 
duped a few members of the media, as 
they can’t stop parroting this ‘‘human 
infrastructure’’ phrase. 
Let’s just call the package what it is: 
a spending plan on progressive social 
justice policies that will be paid for by 
the American taxpayers by 30 tax in-
creases. It has nothing to do with in-
frastructure, even if they could define 
what infrastructure of the human and 
soft variety is. I know reckless tax and 
spending spree is not as catchy as soft 
infrastructure, but at least it is accu-
rate. 
Lastly—and this is the most impor-
tant part—there are costs associated 
with the level of spending that the 
Democrats are laying out, real costs 
that hurt American families. Whether 
it is fully paid for by tax increases or 
whether it adds to the deficit, it all 
boils down to the same thing: the cost 
to American families across our coun-
try, the small business owner, the oper-
ator, the manufacturing worker, the 
farmer, the moms and dads. Hard- 
working Americans across the country 
will be impacted at the absolute worst 
time, when they are trying to recover 
from a pandemic. 
Take the cost of tax increases on 
small businesses, for example. Accord-
ing to the Job Creators Network, 1 mil-
lion—that is 1 million—small busi-
nesses will feel the financial strain of 
tax increases through this bill—1 mil-
lion. Many of these small businesses 
are still struggling after having been 
shuttered in place for a year and hav-
ing 
battled 
against 
government-in-
duced workforce shortages. With only 8 
percent of small businesses on a solid 
economic footing after this past year— 
only 8 percent of our small businesses 
are really, actually, getting back on 
their feet—we should be working to 
help every small business see the light 
at the end of the tunnel, not increasing 
the heavy hand of government and 
keeping them in the dark. It makes no 
sense. 
Then there is the ‘‘let’s just keep 
spending and add to the deficit ap-
proach.’’ The cost of spending so much 
and adding to the deficit means more 
inflation. More inflation means your 
dollar doesn’t go near as far as it has in 
the past. 
In the June jobs report, we saw infla-
tion up 4.5 percent, and the consumer 
price index increased by 5.4 percent, 
the biggest monthly jump in over a 
decade. 
The rising cost of inflation means 
that Americans are making tough 
choices on what is most important to 
them, like filling up your car with gas 
or buying food for your family. There 
is no reason why we should have to be 
making these choices. 
In a nation as great as ours, hard- 
working Americans shouldn’t have to 
choose. American families are caught 
in the middle of rising prices and the 
Democrats’ never-ending need to ap-
pease the far left. 
And then there is the Democrats’ 
view of America, one where Big Gov-
ernment reigns supreme. Well, let me 
tell you, the Big Government approach 
does not work, and it never has. 
Alabamians want Big Government to 
get out of the way because they know 
that Big Government programs only 
tie their hands and stifle innovation 
and growth. 
We need to give folks an opportunity, 
not a handout, and right now, Demo-
crats are on the wrong track with that. 
A government-subsidized economic re-
covery is not an economic recovery. It 
is an entitlement state. We need to get 
back to work. 
Prosperity is not purchased through 
the expansion of Big Government. How 
many times have we heard that? The 
expansion of Big Government safety 
net programs does not make people 
prosperous. Prosperity is found within 
the ideas of the American people. It al-
ways has been, and it always will. 
Democrats are signaling that they 
are OK with the cost of American fami-
lies if it means that they can pay for a 
whole grab bag of far-left policies, like 
the expansion of Medicare, free college, 
and amnesty for illegal immigrants. 
If all this wasn’t bad enough, here is 
the worst of it: Our Democratic col-
leagues have taken their priorities that 
are too radical to pass the Senate and 
creating an if-then scenario with true 
infrastructure negotiations. 
Forced by far-left voices in their 
party, Senator SCHUMER and Speaker 
PELOSI have decided a massive spend-
ing bill that has nothing to do with the 
pandemic or infrastructure should hold 
actual infrastructure legislation hos-
tage. In their world, if we pass a par-
tisan spending bill, then we can pass 
infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4941 
July 19, 2021 
Well, that doesn’t sit right with a lot 
of folks. By linking a bipartisan pro-
posal to a partisan reconciliation pack-
age, our Democrat colleagues are show-
ing their cards. The cards show that 
they really want this reckless tax-and- 
spend spree to pass, and they are fun-
damentally unserious about a true in-
frastructure package that would make 
needed improvements to roads, bridges, 
and broadband possible, and that is a 
shame. By tying budget reconciliation 
to infrastructure, the American people 
are the ones who will be left out to dry. 
I have always said that I would be in 
favor of infrastructure. We all would 
be—a great infrastructure deal, where 
every penny of every dollar goes to-
ward roads, bridges, broadband, and 
waterways. 
But the American taxpayers know 
they have to pay for it. They know 
eventually they will have to pay for it, 
but they need something that they are 
putting their money into that they can 
get something back. But we cannot let 
a partisan tax-and-spend spree bog us 
down and hold back the American tax-
payers. 
This summer, so many Americans are 
traveling across the country. This in-
cludes most of us who travel across our 
States, me across Alabama. As I have 
been on the road, I am reminded once 
again that we need improvements to 
our infrastructure. 
It is more than just fixing potholes 
on a city street. We rely on infrastruc-
ture every day, during our drive to 
work, trucks moving our goods up and 
down the highways, when a ship leaves 
a port with cargo, or when we just get 
on the internet. All those are infra-
structure. 
Good infrastructure allows people to 
move freely, keeps our products flow-
ing, and maintains America’s competi-
tiveness in the global economy. 
In Alabama, we have got 100,000 miles 
of public roads, and we need them to be 
in good shape. Driving on poor roads 
costs Alabama drivers a total of $4.2 
billion every year. Because of things 
like vehicle operating costs, traffic 
congestion, and car crashes, we can tell 
our roads need work. 
We 
have 
got 
1,000 
condemned 
bridges—1,000—just in the State of Ala-
bama. Out of 16,000 bridges, we have 
1,000 that have been condemned that 
need to be repaired in the worst way. 
In an increasingly online world, get-
ting our rural areas access to reliable 
internet is more important than ever. 
Whether it is for work, healthcare, or 
going to school, we need broadband 
across our entire State. Investing in 
our infrastructure is investing in our 
future success. It is way past time to 
step up and act on this. The American 
people need help with infrastructure, 
and that is what we should be concen-
trating on. 
But despite that, our colleagues on 
the left still can’t resist playing poli-
tics here. Before the actual bill text of 
the bipartisan infrastructure frame-
work could be written and before the 
pay-fors were negotiated, Leader SCHU-
MER has called a vote on the frame-
work. 
Now, I know it is pretty hard to get 
a majority of skeptical Senators to 
vote on anything, much less something 
that has not even been written yet. We 
don’t even have the bill written, but we 
are going to vote on it. 
But these are serious times that call 
for serious actions. So we should be 
very careful considering this frame-
work, not rushing toward arbitrary 
deadlines. 
As our country’s economy is trying 
to recover from the pandemic, any-
thing and everything we do has to be 
thoughtfully 
considered, 
especially 
when it comes to passing legislation 
that costs money in the long run. And 
this is going to cost a lot of money. 
Because this is the taxpayers’ money, 
after all—your money—we owe it to 
the taxpayers to spend their money in 
the most efficient and effective way 
possible. 
Personally, I don’t think it is ever a 
good time to raise taxes, but I can tell 
you the absolute worst time is when we 
are still coming out of an absolute 
global pandemic. 
There are commonsense ways to pay 
for some of this new infrastructure 
spending. Chief among them is re-
directing all that unused COVID money 
that the Democrats insisted on spend-
ing earlier this year, and there is a lot 
of it left. 
Let me be clear. Raising taxes on the 
American people should be a non-
starter for any potential bill. It cer-
tainly is for a lot of people. 
Folks, simply put, a dollar spent on 
traditional infrastructure is a dollar 
well spent. But it has got to be done in 
a smart and targeted way, and we can’t 
allow Democrats to hurt Americans by 
creating an if-then scenario. 
Let’s spend some time on the infra-
structure bill and do it the right way. 
Then we can turn to debating all the 
spending that our colleagues on the 
left have their sights set on. But we 
have to do the infrastructure bill first. 
Hopefully, Congress can deliver the 
targeted results our country deserves, 
results that don’t increase the tax bur-
den on the American people. 
Throughout this debate, you can 
count on a lot of us to be a strong voice 
for making infrastructure work for 
three or four things: Alabama, our 
neighbors, our country’s rural areas, 
and the American taxpayer. 
We can get this done. Let’s just do it 
the right way. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise again—again—to call for 
every Senator to have a chance to vote 
on our bill, the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act. It is time to move the most seri-
ous crimes like sexual assault and mur-
der out of the chain of command and 
put them in the hands of the most ca-
pable people in the military—inde-
pendent, impartial, highly trained uni-
formed prosecutors. 
This is an issue that deserves ur-
gency. I have been calling for a full 
floor vote since May 24. Since that 
time, an estimated 3,136 servicemem-
bers will have been raped or sexually 
assaulted and more will have been vic-
tims of other serious crimes. While I 
am heartened to see, after many years 
of pushing for reform, that growing 
numbers of our colleagues, the Depart-
ment of Defense, and the President 
have acknowledged that we must move 
sexual assault and related crimes like 
sexual violence out of the chain of 
command, it is simply not enough. 
I ask my colleagues to consider what 
it truly means to have special victim 
prosecutors looking only at cases of 
sexual assault and related crimes. It 
means that all the myriad crimes that 
are often linked to special victims’ 
cases will get left out and pushed into 
a system that is not trained to see 
them for what they are. 
Let’s just take a simple case of a 
forged check. Say a soldier takes his 
girlfriend’s checkbook and forges her 
name. If a commander looks at that, 
they are likely to take that at face 
value, see it as a simple, cut-and-dried 
case of someone stealing money from 
someone else, and move forward with 
nonjudicial punishment. 
If a military prosecutor was to look 
at that same case, they might see 
something entirely different. That is 
because prosecutors are trained to see 
linkages between crimes. They are 
taught to ask different questions. So 
when they see a forged check, they ask: 
Is there more happening here? And 
there usually is. 
Research has shown that financial 
abuse occurs in 99 percent of domestic 
violence cases. Financial abuse can be 
the means by which an abuser gains 
control in a relationship, and it is 
often the main reason a survivor stays 
with their abuser. While a prosecutor 
who has worked on cases of both finan-
cial crimes and domestic violence 
would 
know 
that, 
a 
commander 
wouldn’t likely know. 
The truth is, the realities of intimate 
partner violence go far beyond sexual 
assault and harassment. It can include 
forging checks and carrying out other 
forms of financial fraud, as well as 
other serious crimes. 
We know that child endangerment 
can be linked to domestic violence and 
intimate partner violence, as can kid-
napping. Arson can be the tool of some-
one attempting to cover up these

crimes. And murder, manslaughter, 
and murder of a pregnant woman can 
be, and often are, the final, tragic cul-
mination of domestic violence. When 
these types of crimes are presented to 
commanders, they may be just the tip 
of an iceberg—the tip of an iceberg of 
cases that we all agree should be han-
dled by a special prosecutor. 
So if we truly want to help survivors 
of sexual assault and domestic vio-
lence, we have to acknowledge that 
some of those crimes don’t happen in a 
vacuum. We must remove all serious 
crimes out of the chain of command 
and into the hands of trained prosecu-
tors who have the education, training, 
and experience that these cases require 
and that our servicemembers deserve. 
The Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act does ex-
actly that, and it is supported by the 
major veterans service organization 
groups, as well as groups like the Na-
tional Alliance to End Sexual Violence 
and the National Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence, which recognize the 
true impact of this reform. It is also 
supported by a bipartisan, filibuster- 
proof majority of Senators who should 
be allowed the opportunity to cast 
their vote. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that at a time to be deter-
mined by the majority leader in con-
sultation with the Republican leader, 
the Senate Committee on Armed Serv-
ices be discharged from further consid-
eration of S. 1520 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its consideration; that there be 
2 hours for debate equally divided in 
the usual form, and that upon the use 
or yielding back of that time, the Sen-
ate vote on the bill with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. I object, Madam Presi-
dent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
have been to the floor several times 
with Senator GILLIBRAND not only to 
compliment her on the hard work she 
has put into this bill for so many years 
now—I think going back to 2013—but 
also to give my support to this effort 
as well. She doesn’t need the com-
pliments. She doesn’t want them. But I 
say that she is entitled to the hard 
work that she has put into this bill, 
and it is time that we pass this legisla-
tion. 
We are told that the bill will be con-
sidered by the Armed Services Com-
mittee as part of the NDAA. That is 
not a good reason to deny consider-
ation as a stand-alone bill on the floor, 
which is what Senator GILLIBRAND has 
been to this floor numerous times to 
get done, and each time was objected 
to. 
Now, the Armed Services Committee 
serves this Senate well for what it does 
on military policy, but when it comes 
to this particular piece of legislation, 
it is unfortunate that the Committee 
has a track record of gutting provi-
sions that they don’t like, even after 
the provisions receive the votes to be 
included. 
On another issue, I want to recall 
what the Senate and House conferees 
did to a bill to prevent cuts to the Air 
National Guard. The provision was in-
cluded in both the House and Senate 
NDAA but was quietly struck from the 
conference report. And bringing this 
bill separately on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate and getting it passed will pre-
vent like things from happening to this 
sexual assault legislation. 
So this legislation is needed now. 
I think Senator GILLIBRAND has said 
it has 66 cosponsors, and that is exactly 
right, because there are far too many 
women and men in the Armed Forces 
being sexually assaulted and most 
never see justice. The rates of retalia-
tion are too high, and prosecutions are 
too low. 
Now, over the past month, I have 
heard favorable comments about at-
tacking 
this 
issue 
from 
President 
Biden. I have heard an independent 
commission at the Pentagon speak to 
it. I have heard Secretary Austin speak 
to it. Now, whether they specifically 
support this legislation or not, they at 
least have admitted that sexual assault 
in the military is a major, major prob-
lem that needs to be dealt with in some 
way, but I am saying it will never be 
dealt with until we get Senator GILLI-
BRAND’s legislation passed. 
More importantly, it has the votes— 
66 votes in the U.S. Senate, for sure, 
and probably more when people have to 
put their vote on the line to be a stand- 
alone piece of legislation. It is time for 
the legislation to finally move forward, 
and I would urge my colleagues to 
allow it to proceed. 
But as has happened before, we found 
out today is not that day. But that day 
should have been years ago, consid-
ering this problem is getting worse 
from year to year and, more impor-
tantly, the fact that it is such a big 
problem, and retaliation is such a big 
problem that you don’t even get accu-
rate statistics on the number of people 
that have been sexually assaulted, be-
cause they know if they go forward and 
report it, they will be retaliated 
against. It is a situation that we have 
dealt with for too long without the so-
lutions that have been promised work-
ing, and so the only way to solve this 
problem is with Senator GILLIBRAND’s 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last 16 months, no community has 
been spared from the devastation of 
COVID–19. The virus itself has claimed 
the lives of more than 600,000 Ameri-
cans, including more than 50,000 Tex-
ans, and we are still gaining a fuller 
picture 
of 
the 
far-reaching 
con-
sequences of this pandemic. 
We know that the mitigation efforts 
led to the closure of countless small 
businesses and upended the livelihoods 
of millions of workers. The transition 
to virtual learning robbed children of 
valuable time alongside their peers in 
the classroom. And the emotional and 
financial stresses of the pandemic led 
to devastating consequences for our 
friends and neighbors who were already 
in a vulnerable situations. 
As families spent more time isolating 
at home last year, we saw an increase 
in domestic violence. Individuals who 
were already experiencing anxiety and 
depression faced even greater chal-
lenges during this difficult period. And 
those battling substance-use disorders 
faced an even steeper uphill climb. On 
top of the stress and isolation of the 
pandemic, many lost access to treat-
ment facilities and outreach programs. 
No community has been spared from 
the wrath of the opioid epidemic. In 
2019, there were more than 70,000 over-
dose deaths in America, a devastating 
number. Now we have a much clearer 
picture of how this crisis worsened in 
2020. 
Last year, more than 93,000 Ameri-
cans died from drug overdoses. That is 
more than a 30-percent increase over 
the previous year. It marks the largest 
annual increase in at least three dec-
ades. 
Following years of fighting to turn 
the tide on the opioid epidemic, this is 
a stunning blow and a deep disappoint-
ment. Here in the Senate, this issue is 
about as bipartisan as they come. As I 
said, every State, every community 
has been hit by the scourge of opioids, 
and every person in this Chamber, I be-
lieve, wants to turn the tide on this 
crisis. 
In 2016, thanks to the leadership of 
our friend Senator PORTMAN of Ohio, 
and the hard work of a bipartisan 
group of Senators, we passed what be-
came known as CARA, the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act, to 
help end this devastating cycle of drug 
abuse and death. Just a couple of years 
ago, we celebrated some incremental 
progress. In 2018, drug overdoses were 
down, or deaths from drug overdoses 
were down 4 percent from the previous 
year, the first decrease in nearly three 
decades. 
But, unfortunately, that trend was 
short-lived. Overdose deaths increased 
in 2019, and they skyrocketed in 2020. 
Now is the time for the Senate to take 
further action and help the American 
people fight back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4943 
July 19, 2021 
Tomorrow, the Senate Caucus on 
International Narcotics Control will 
hold a hearing on the Federal Govern-
ment’s response to the drug overdose 
crisis. We will hear from experts, in-
cluding the acting directors of the Of-
fice of National Drug Control Policy 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, as 
well as Dr. Nora Volkow, the Director 
of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse. I hope we will learn more about 
what additional steps we can take to 
reverse this concerning trend, as well 
as what more needs to be done. 
One of the most effective ways to 
avoid drug overdose deaths, though, is 
to prevent those drugs from ever reach-
ing our communities in the first place. 
And, of course, Customs and Border 
Protection plays a vital role in stop-
ping illicit drugs from entering our 
country. And it has seen an alarming 
amount of drugs coming across our 
southern border, as I speak—one of the 
most 
concerning, 
of 
course, 
being 
fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. 
Depending on your body weight, 2 
milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal; a 
kilogram, which is 2.2 pounds, could 
kill 
500,000 
people; 
2.2 
pounds 
of 
fentanyl, something you could put a 
couple of kilograms in a backpack and 
walk it over to the southwestern bor-
der. 
In fiscal year 2021, so far, Customs 
and Border Protection has seized more 
than 8,500 pounds of fentanyl. For con-
text, that is a 78-percent increase over 
the previous year, and we still have 3 
months to go. The amount of fentanyl 
that we have interdicted in the past 9 
months is just shy of the total weight 
from fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 
combined. That is a dramatic increase. 
And it has deadly consequences. 
Nearly 
three-quarters 
of 
fatal 
overdoses last year were attributed to 
opioids—some synthetic, like fentanyl; 
others like heroin—manufactured pri-
marily in Mexico, 90 percent of which 
is imported in the United States comes 
from Mexico. 
The alarming increase in the supply 
coming across our southwestern border 
foreshadows even more devastating 
overdose statistics in the months and 
years to come. And fentanyl isn’t the 
only dangerous drug moving across our 
southern 
border. 
Methamphetamine, 
cocaine, and heroin, as I said, are com-
ing into our country at alarming rates. 
If people don’t care about the human-
itarian crisis at the border that has 
seen a million encounters with Border 
Patrol the last year alone, if they don’t 
care about the fact that we are not 
stopping illegal immigration into the 
country and what consequences that 
will have on our country for many 
years to come, hopefully they care a 
little bit about the drug overdose 
deaths that are caused by the importa-
tion—illegal importation of these drugs 
across the southern border. 
According to the Drug Enforcement 
Administration’s National Drug Threat 
Assessment, the vast majority of her-
oin, as I said, comes from Mexico—a 
staggering 92 percent, to be precise. 
As we have discussed the border on 
the crisis, I have talked about the cas-
cading consequences of this migration 
surge. When Border Patrol agents are 
pulled off the front lines to care for mi-
grant children, as many of them are, it 
creates a huge gap in our border con-
trols and creates huge security vulner-
abilities. It, of course, makes it more 
difficult for the Border Patrol to do the 
job that they signed on for, which is to 
interdict dangerous people and sub-
stances, 
including 
these 
dangerous 
drugs. 
So until we can get this current hu-
manitarian crisis under control, we are 
making it nearly impossible for the 
Border Patrol to catch or deter the car-
tels from moving their poison across 
the border, and we are creating even 
more risk for Americans already strug-
gling with addiction and drug abuse. 
Getting the border under control 
should be a top priority for the Biden 
administration, but they seem com-
pletely oblivious to what is happening, 
and they don’t really seem to under-
stand the dynamics. We know the tra-
ditional push factors—poverty and vio-
lence in your home country—but it 
takes a lot for people to want to leave 
their home country and take the dan-
gerous trek to the United States. 
But, of course, they are having the 
coyotes, the human smugglers, whisper 
in their ears and say: For $5,000 or for 
$7,000, we will get you to America. 
But it is also the pull factors. It is 
the perception that if you come to the 
border, that you will successfully make 
your way into the interior and you will 
be allowed to stay. Of course, that is 
not what our laws call for, but that is 
exactly what these smugglers, the 
coyotes, are planning on and what is 
attracting, like a huge magnet, hun-
dreds of thousands, even a million peo-
ple this year alone, across our southern 
border. And it is the same chaos and 
confusion caused by this flooding of the 
border and the diversion of law enforce-
ment that is allowing these drugs to 
come across the border, which, as I 
said, have killed 93,000 Americans in 
the last year alone. 
In addition to stopping these drugs 
from making their way into our coun-
try, we also need to identify more ef-
fective ways to break the cycle of ad-
diction, and that is especially true for 
those individuals who have been incar-
cerated. It is difficult to know the 
exact numbers, but research shows 
that an estimated 65 percent of the 
U.S. prison population has an active 
substance use disorder. Without access 
to treatment while incarcerated, these 
men and women face a steep, maybe an 
impossible, uphill climb after they are 
released. In order to give an incarcer-
ated individual the strongest possible 
opportunity after serving their time in 
our criminal justice system, we need to 
invest more in effective treatment op-
tions once they leave prison. 
The good news is there is already a 
bipartisan bill out there that does ex-
actly that. Earlier this year, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE—the Senator from Rhode 
Island—and I introduced the Residen-
tial Substance Use Disorder Treatment 
Act to help incarcerated individuals 
break this cycle of addiction. 
Now, we know we are not going to be 
able to save everybody, but for those 
who are willing to put in the hard work 
and effort and to seek the counseling 
and treatment that is necessary, we be-
lieve we can save some lives. This leg-
islation updates the residential sub-
stance abuse treatment program and 
expands access to treatment in jails 
and prisons across the country. The 
program, as it currently exists, already 
provides incarcerated individuals with 
access to treatment for substance use 
disorders. That treatment is coupled 
with programs to prepare these men 
and women for reentry into civil soci-
ety 
and 
provide 
community-based 
treatment once they are released. 
Because of these men and women who 
have struggled hard while they have 
been in prison and in jail to overcome 
their addiction, many are returning to 
the same conditions and the same 
friends and the company and commu-
nities that they came from. Without 
this kind of help, we know what the re-
sults are likely to be. 
Our legislation opens up even more 
opportunities for successful rehabilita-
tion and continued recovery. It pro-
vides providers with more options to 
treat substance use disorders. It re-
quires program staff to be trained in 
the science of addiction, evidence- 
based therapies and strategies for con-
tinuity of care, and it ensures pro-
grams are affiliated with providers who 
can continue treatment after incarcer-
ation. In short, these changes will give 
the formerly incarcerated men and 
women the best possible shot at living 
healthier, longer, and more productive 
lives. 
I am sure it is no surprise that this 
kind of legislation has strong bipar-
tisan support, both here in the Senate 
and among the various organizations 
that work in this field. Twenty-seven 
groups wrote a letter to Senator 
WHITEHOUSE and me endorsing this leg-
islation. This includes a broad range of 
criminal justice and behavioral groups, 
such as the Addiction Policy Forum, 
the National Alliance on Mental Ill-
ness, and the Community Anti-Drug 
Coalitions of America. 
I haven’t heard from a single Sen-
ator, Republican or Democrat, who has 
expressed oppositions or even concern 
about the bill. This is an example of 
the bipartisan, commonsense actions 
that we need to be taking more often 
and, in this case, to address a very seri-
ous and clearly growing problem. These 
commonsense policy changes can help 
people struggling with drug abuse to fi-
nally escape the cycle and build a bet-
ter life when they return to their com-
munities. 
I hope that the Senate will soon pass 
this bill and move it one step closer to 
President Biden’s desk. The dramatic

spike in drug overdose deaths last year 
should serve as a call to action for all 
of us. To secure our border, to help 
those struggling to overcome addic-
tion, the tools and the training to do 
so, there is an urgent action that we 
can take and should take to address 
both. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
f 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, there was such an interesting oc-
currence 
that 
happened 
down 
the 
street a bit at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue last weekend, and it is when White 
House Press Secretary Jen Psaki un-
veiled the scheme that her colleagues 
in the West Wing had worked out with 
Big Tech. 
Well, what they are setting about to 
do is to remove—and I am quoting 
her—‘‘problematic’’ 
content 
from 
Facebook and other digital platforms. 
That is right. They, the White House 
team, have decided that they are going 
to work with Big Tech, and they are 
going to remove ‘‘problematic’’—their 
term—content 
from 
Facebook 
and 
other digital platforms. 
Now, I am certain that the White 
House was very confident that the 
press would treat this rather bizarre 
admission like they have treated other 
blatant oversteps coming out of this 
administration. After all, they, the 
press, have provided reliable cover for 
this White House since Inauguration 
Day. 
But here is the problem. It is no 
longer Inauguration Day. There is now 
a record to consider, and I will tell you 
what, no matter what they do, the 
mainstream media is not going to be 
able to turn the clock back on this 
overstep. 
In just 6 months, the Biden adminis-
tration has done an admirable job 
showing the American people exactly 
who they are. We have seen enough at 
this point to take the admission of 
being in cahoots with Big Tech at face 
value. The administration has inten-
tionally 
overwhelmed 
the 
airwaves 
with big promises that are conven-
iently light on details. 
And there is a good reason for that. 
What President Biden and the Demo-
crats are trying to do would fundamen-
tally 
transform 
this 
country 
into 
something that we, the people, would 
have a very difficult time even recog-
nizing. 
They got off to a great start toward 
their goals by killing jobs in the name 
of climate extremism and opening the 
border to a flood of illegal immigrants 
with no plan at all to manage the in-
flux. They just said: Let’s send them to 
the States, and let local communities 
and States cover this cost. 
They tried to dupe the American peo-
ple into getting behind a so-called in-
frastructure plan that was anything 
but infrastructure. Then they doubled 
down on a brazen attempt to extend 
the Federal Government’s control over 
schools and homes. They labeled this 
spending spree the American Families 
Plan to provide cover for yet another 
attack on, what else, the nuclear fam-
ily. 
Then they launched an all-out war on 
the ballot box in the name of the peo-
ple. And now we see that they worked 
out a perfect system to force the oppo-
sition to shut up—just throw a flag on 
your opponents and watch their digital 
footprint and their freedom of speech 
evaporate. 
There is a way to shut them down. It 
is called government-approved mes-
saging. Obviously, somewhere in the 
White House, they tucked their reali-
ties that they alluded to back in Janu-
ary, and now this is what we are see-
ing. 
I know we already have members of 
the mainstream media who are running 
defense on behalf of this little collabo-
ration between the White House and 
Big Tech, but it is time to get serious 
about what is going on here. The Presi-
dent of the United States is using the 
full force of his administration to si-
lence his political opponents. That is 
correct. 
This isn’t just dystopian. It also 
raises serious questions about how 
much pressure the Federal Government 
can put on a private entity to restrict 
political speech. Think about that. 
This administration, working with Big 
Tech, is going to deem certain mes-
sages government approved and others 
as being open to censorship. It is, in-
deed, a complete violation of the trust 
the American people put in Joe Biden 
when they sent him to the White 
House. 
But as the new majority has made 
clear, to tear down and rebuild the 
United States in their own image is 
something that is a goal. And in order 
to do that, they attack the foundation. 
They have to get rid of all the things 
that make America so incredibly spe-
cial: our commitment to safety and se-
curity, the importance of the family, 
and the near sacrosanct promise of free 
speech and open debate. 
They have gotten off to a pretty good 
start, those Democrats. But for their 
vision to take hold, the Democratic 
majority must convince a critical mass 
of their countrymen to adopt their 
same narrow viewpoint. Fortunately, 
the American people are not accus-
tomed to doing what they are told sim-
ply because an authority figure said go 
do it. 
Here is a quote that former President 
Reagan made regularly, and I know we 
have heard it and seen it on this floor 
several times so far this year: 
Freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. It has to be 
fought for and defended by each generation. 
That is so important for us to re-
member. It is important because it is 
something that we are seeing really 
kind of lived out right now. We have to 
take this as something of a warning 
when you look at the steps that this 
administration is taking. If anything, 
they are taking big steps to see just 
how far they can push the limits of de-
mocracy: How much will the people 
take? How much freedom are they will-
ing to give up? 
Just about every single policy com-
ing out of this White House has been 
used by the Democrats as a weapon to 
diminish freedom in the name of a 
preapproved socialist fantasy. And in 
that fantasy, there is no room for free 
speech or dissent. Censorship becomes 
normalized. It is expected. Collectivism 
replaces individualism. The philoso-
phies of democracy and self-determina-
tion fall victim to the moving goal-
posts of a living Constitution, and free-
dom is reduced to an outdated trope 
that only the unenlightened cling to. 
I wonder, how many people in this 
country do you think actually have 
that as a goal? How many do you think 
are wanting to give up their free speech 
and their freedom and hand it over to 
the government and let the govern-
ment decide what they are going to 
give back to them, how much freedom 
they are going to allow them to exer-
cise over their daily life, over their 
children’s education, over the edu-
cation that they want to have, or the 
job they want to have, or the home 
they want to live in, or the car that 
they want to drive? Do you really 
think that Americans want to give 
their freedom up? 
Since the 2016 election, the left has 
existed in a state of perpetual hysteria. 
It has been over the threat that our 
God-given freedom poses threats to 
their radical, socialist agenda. But in-
stead of taking the conventional route 
of persuasion, they chose a high-pres-
sure guilt campaign to force people 
into a prepackaged American experi-
ence. They want everyone marching in 
line with the daily talking points be-
cause we want calm, they say. Democ-
racy is too messy. It is too unpredict-
able. No one wants to exist in that sys-
tem, they say. 
But I differ in my opinion. Yes, it is 
messy, but this big, beautiful, diverse 
mess is what sets this country apart. It 
makes us strong and successful and 
unites us under the common cause of 
freedom. And as we are all well aware, 
it has also turned this shining city on 
a hill into a magnet for criticism from 
nations foundering under the disas-
trous consequences of their great so-
cialist experiment. 
I would implore my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to stop trying to 
fit in with these failing systems. Stop 
diminishing the cause of freedom be-
cause it inconveniences you. Abandon 
your fear of open debate. This constant 
refusal to engage says much more 
about the strength of your policy posi-
tions than it does about ours. Above 
all, stop ignoring the American people. 
They didn’t vote for this. They do not 
want this. 
It is so interesting to me every week-
end to go home and listen to Ten-
nesseans who talk about the changes

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
for the past several months, both 
Democrats and Republicans have been 
hard at work putting together two 
major infrastructure bills to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century. We have 
proceeded along two tracks. The first 
track is a bipartisan infrastructure 
framework that has been agreed to by 
a group of Democrats and Republican 
Senators and the White House. The sec-
ond track is a budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions that will 
allow the Senate to take up the Amer-
ican Jobs and Families Plan and make 
historic investments in jobs, family 
support policies, and initiatives to 
fight climate change. This week, the 
Senate 
aims 
to 
make 
even 
more 
progress on these tracks. 
Tonight, in a few minutes, I will file 
cloture on a shell bill, which will act as 
a legislative vehicle for the bipartisan 
infrastructure framework. That vote 
on cloture will take place on Wednes-
day. Again, that vote on Wednesday 
will be a vote on cloture simply to the 
motion to proceed to a debate on a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. 
I want to be clear about what these 
steps mean. There has been some con-
fusion. What we are talking about this 
week is a vote on whether to proceed to 
debate on the bipartisan infrastructure 
framework. The motion to proceed on 
Wednesday is simply about getting the 
legislative process started here on the 
Senate floor; it is not a deadline to de-
termine every final detail of the bill. 
All a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the motion to pro-
ceed simply means is that the Senate is 
ready to begin debating and amending 
a bipartisan infrastructure bill; no 
more, no less. 
It is important to remember that 
even after the Wednesday cloture vote, 
there are up to 30 hours of debate be-
fore we can adopt the motion to pro-
ceed and offer amendments. 
So let me be very clear about what I 
am committing to the Senate as major-
ity leader. If the bipartisan group of 
Senators reaches a final agreement on 
legislative text by Thursday, I will 
make that agreement the pending sub-
stitute amendment for debate once the 
motion to proceed is adopted. If for 
some reason the group does not finalize 
the legislative text to the agreement in 
time for Thursday, then I will offer an 
amendment consisting only of the ele-
ments of the bill that have already 
been put through committee on a bi-
partisan process. This will allow this 
Senate to begin debate and amend-
ments on the bipartisan base bill, 
which has four main components: 
First, the Environment and Public 
Works Committee report of the water 
bill. This bill passed by a voice vote in 
committee and then 89 to 2 on the Sen-
ate floor. 
Second, the Environment and Public 
Works Committee report of the high-
way bill. This passed by 20 to nothing. 
Third, the Commerce Committee re-
port on the rail and safety bill. This 
bill passed by 25 to 3. 
Fourth, the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee report of the En-
ergy bill. This passed 13 to 7. 
Again, if the text of the bipartisan 
deal is ready on Thursday, I will offer 
it as the first substitute amendment. If 
for some reason it is not, I will offer an 
amendment that consists only of the 
elements of the bill that have gone 
through committee with substantial 
bipartisan support, the four pieces that 
I mentioned just a second ago. 
Now, I have spoken with the five 
leading Democratic negotiators: Sen-
ators SINEMA, WARNER, TESTER, SHA-
HEEN, and MANCHIN. They support this 
approach. 
I would remind my colleagues, mov-
ing to proceed to a legislative vehicle, 
a shell bill, for bipartisan legislation, 
even while the negotiators finalize the 
text of that legislation, is a routine 
process in this Chamber. We have done 
it repeatedly. It is a sign of good faith 
from both sides that negotiations will 
continue in earnest and both sides are 
committed to reaching an outcome. 
Earlier this year, the Senate moved 
forward on a vehicle—a legislative ve-
hicle—for what became the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act. In fact, we went 
through the same process when the 
Senate moved to proceed to the legisla-
tive vehicle for what ultimately be-
came the United States Innovation and 
Competition Act. In that legislation, 
our Senate committees were working 
on various bills that all had to do with 
American innovation and competition. 
The Commerce Committee reported 
out the Endless Frontier Act. The For-
eign Relations Committee reported out 
the Strategic Competition Act. And 
the Homeland Security Committee re-
ported out additional pieces of legisla-
tion. We put them together once we 
voted to proceed to debate on the topic. 
The same thing—the very same thing 
is happening on the bipartisan infra-
structure bill. 
I understand that both sides are 
working very hard to turn the bipar-
tisan infrastructure framework into 
final legislation, and they will con-
tinue to have more time to debate, 
amend, and perfect the bill once the 
Senate votes to take up this crucial 
issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4946 
July 19, 2021 
But they have been working on this 
bipartisan framework for more than a 
month already, and it is time to begin 
the debate. We must make significant 
progress on both the bipartisan infra-
structure bill and the budget resolu-
tion before the end of the work period. 
There is no reason we can’t get the ball 
rolling this week on both elements of 
the Senate’s infrastructure agenda. 
VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT 
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, VOCA, tomorrow, the Senate will 
take up a desperately needed fix to the 
Victims of Crime Act. Survivors of vio-
lent crime often bear tremendous fi-
nancial hardship, everything from med-
ical costs to emergency housing, to 
legal fees and mental health services. 
After suffering a violent crime, the 
last thing Americans should have to 
worry about is being unable to afford 
the basic services they need to stitch 
their lives back together. So, for over 
35 years, the Justice Department’s 
Crime Victims Fund has provided as-
sistance to Americans impacted by vio-
lent crime, such as domestic abuse, 
sexual 
assault, 
human 
trafficking, 
DUIs, and other horrific crimes. 
Traditionally, most of the funding 
came from penalties paid through Fed-
eral convictions, but over time the 
fund has shrunk dramatically. Com-
pared to 5 years ago, next year, the vic-
tims of crime fund could fall to less 
than one-twentieth of its former size. 
So, tomorrow, the Senate will vote 
on a measure to replenish the victim of 
crimes fund and ensure that it remains 
stable for the foreseeable future. This 
legislation passed the House with over-
whelming bipartisan support, and here 
in the Senate it has at least 63 cospon-
sors. The legislation ought to sail 
through the Senate tomorrow. 
The survivors of violent crimes de-
serve the peace of mind that they do 
not bear the burden of recovering from 
their trauma alone.

TRIBUTE TO BILL BRASCH 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the past 3 years Bill Brasch has led 
our shared fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, 
as national president, helping the orga-
nization 
navigate 
the 
tumultuous 
COVID–19 pandemic. Through his work, 
he helped maintain a vast network of 
philanthropy and brotherhood that has 
raised more than $1.6 million for char-
ity in the past 25 years and developed 
more than 100,000 men of character into 
men of distinction since 1906. Bill has 
contributed immensely to the con-
tinuity and growth of Phi Kappa Tau 
and helped it develop into a formidable 
nationwide organization. 
Bill attended my alma mater, the 
University of Louisville, and built a 
prestigious reputation in student gov-
ernment and Greek life. He remained 
at the school after graduation, spend-
ing 32 years coordinating the construc-
tion and renovation of campus build-
ings, including the Phi Kappa Tau fra-
ternity house in 2007. He continued his 
involvement in Phi Kappa Tau at both 
the local and national level, eventually 
rising to his current role in 2018. 
Bill saw our fraternity through one 
of its most challenging periods when, 
in the spring of 2020, the COVID–19 pan-
demic forced colleges and universities 
across the country to shutter. Thou-
sands of brothers were sent home from 
campus, threatening the very core of 
fraternity life. Bill’s tenure as national 
president, originally intended to be a 2- 
year term, was extended into 2021 as 
the crisis forced Phi Kappa Tau to can-
cel its national convention. However, 
through Bill’s hard work, the frater-
nity didn’t just survive the pandemic 
but thrived. Phi Kappa Tau is now 
well-prepared to return to campuses 
across the country and bring young 
men back together in brotherhood, just 
as it has for more than a century. 
Bill Brasch has devoted his life to 
Phi Kappa Tau’s mission ‘‘to champion 
a lifelong commitment to brotherhood, 
learning, ethical leadership and exem-
plary character.’’ In recognition of his

University of Louisville Alumni Fellow 
for 2021 and will be honored during the 
halftime celebration at this year’s 
homecoming 
football 
game. 
His 
mentorship and leadership have been 
invaluable to our fraternity’s success, 
both in Kentucky and across America. 
On behalf of the Senate, I would like to 
thank Bill for his leadership in times of 
crisis and congratulate him on a suc-
cessful presidency. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARK AND LORI 
WILSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the past 15 years, Mark and Lori 
Wilson have been key organizers of 
Kentucky’s legendary Fancy Farm Pic-
nic, held annually at St. Jerome Catho-
lic Church. This event brings together 
elected officials and spectators from all 
over the Commonwealth for good-na-
tured debate and celebration. For dec-
ades, the impassioned speeches and 
zingers delivered at the Fancy Farm 
Picnic have riveted Kentuckians and 
brought nationwide fame to the event’s 
namesake hometown. The picnic also 
serves as a significant fundraiser for 
St. Jerome, providing resources for the 
church’s elementary school and chari-
table efforts serving the community. 
All this success would never have been 
possible without the dedicated leader-
ship of local volunteers like Mark and 
Lori. 
Every year, Mark and Lori welcome 
upwards of 15,000 attendees to Fancy 
Farm, KY, but that is merely the most 
widely known aspect of their work. 
They are also deeply involved in St. Je-
rome, helping the church year-round 
with its public service efforts. Mark is 
a longtime member of the western Ken-
tucky agriculture industry, often hu-
morously comparing his role at the 
Fancy Farm Picnic to farming: ‘‘like 
growing a crop of tobacco, it’s a thir-
teen-month job.’’ The couple are clas-
sic Kentuckians, dedicated to commu-
nity and tradition. 
Though the Fancy Farm Picnic was 
canceled 
last 
year 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, Mark and Lori 
built a strong foundation for the event 
to continue full-speed ahead this year. 
Under the leadership of their successor 
Steven Elder, Fancy Farm will con-
tinue to captivate the Commonwealth 
with its annual festival of bingo, bar-
becue, and amicable banter. 
Mark and Lori have dedicated count-
less hours to their church, community, 
and State. On behalf of the Senate, I 
would like to express our gratitude for 
their committed work in support of the 
Commonwealth.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING BETTY THOMPSON 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, today 
I would like to recognize a good friend 
who has meant so much to those in St. 
Louis, across Missouri, and throughout 
the Nation. Betty Thompson passed 
away Sunday, July 11, 2021, at the age 
of 81. 
Betty was a great leader, respected 
voice in the community, and was 
known for her service to others. Along 
with her public service, she was known 
for her generosity and caring nature to 
help those in need. She was the first 
African American to serve on the Uni-
versity City City Council and remained 
on that council for 18 years. She then 
was elected in 1997 to serve in the Mis-
souri House of Representatives where 
she represented the 72nd District until 
2004. From being a State representative 
to her advocacy for civil rights, she 
truly was a beacon of light. 
Betty and I saw each other many 
times over the past 12 years. She pro-
vided a welcoming environment no 
matter the place and was always a 
trusted counsel during our conversa-
tions. 
Jack and Betty Thompson were a 
month away from celebrating their 
62nd wedding anniversary. Along with 
her husband, Betty is survived by her 
children 
Tony 
Thompson, 
Sonja 
Branscomb, and Kwame Thompson, and 
seven grandchildren. She was preceded 
in death by her son, Tyrone Thompson, 
and grandson, Tyrell Thompson. 
I am grateful to have known Betty 
and thankful for the impact she has 
had on my own life, as well as those 
around Missouri.∑

SHAWN HAUSE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Shawn Hause 
for his longstanding and esteemed career in 
law enforcement and service to our country. 
At the age of 19, Shawn knew he wanted to 
serve in law enforcement and joined the 
Washington State Patrol Explorers in the Spo-
kane District 4 Detachment and learned the 
ways of Washington State Patrol for two years 
until aging out of the program. At the age of 
23, he was accepted into the Spokane County 
Reserve Deputy program where he volun-
teered a minimum of 16 hours a month in pa-
trol work as a deputy sheriff. During this time, 
Shawn also was hired by the Colfax Police 
Department in Colfax, Wash. as a part-time of-
ficer. Shawn was credited with making the 
largest drug bust of any Colfax officer at that 
time after stopping a vehicle and seizing over 
one pound of marijuana enroute to the Wash-
ington State University campus. 
Two years later, Shawn was hired by the 
Spokane County Sheriffs office as a full-time 
deputy sheriff. He attended the Spokane Po-
lice Academy and graduated at the top of his 
class in firearms proficiency. He went on to 
work graveyard, swing shift, power shift and 
dayshift patrol. He volunteered to be a fire-
arms instructor where he instructed new re-
cruits and his peers for six years. He was then 
accepted into the Spokane County SWAT 
(Special Weapons and Tactics) Team. He 
graduated from the Hanford SWAT Basic 
School in Richland, Wash. and served with the 
SWAT team for approximately nine months. 
After working as a patrol deputy for about 
seven years, successfully making numerous 
arrests for various drug violations, Shawn was 
accepted to Spokane County’s drug unit, 
known as the Investigative Support Unit. In 
that role, he worked low to mid-level drug 
crimes within the Spokane County area. He 
worked in that position for four and a half 
years until the position was defunded at which 
time he returned to patrol work. Following six 
months of patrol, Shawn was accepted as part 
of the Spokane Regional Drug Task Force 
(SRDTF). 
In the SRDTF, Shawn worked closely with 
the Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Attorney’s 
Office and other state and local agencies to 
identify, infiltrate and dismantle high-level drug 
traffickers and Drug Trafficking Organizations 
in the Eastern District of Washington. During 
this time, Shawn was involved in an officer-in-
volved shooting that took the life of his partner 
and best friend. Shawn also worked in an un-
dercover capacity, buying large quantities of 
methamphetamine from different factions of 
the Sinaloa Drug Cartel, Shawn also assisted 
other agents/officers with a large scale, multi- 
state Oxycodone investigation that involved 
the Eight-Trey gang out of California in which 
the SRDTF and DEA were nationally recog-
nized for their work. Shawn also worked with 
the FBI’s Gang Enforcement Task Force 
where he worked to specifically target drug 
cartels and gang members that were commit-
ting drug crimes. While working with the FBI, 
Shawn held a Top Secret security clearance. 
As a five-year rotated position, Shawn was ro-
tated out of his drug investigator role after 
being granted an extra year based on his un-
dercover work that was ongoing in the U.S. 
and Mexico. 
In total, Shawn spent more than 10 years 
working drug crimes and finished his career as 
a uniformed patrol deputy. He medically re-
tired in good standing in 2019. I want to ex-
tend my deepest appreciation for Shawn 
Hause’s service to the State of Washington, 
the surrounding region and our country.

FR. CAPODANNO LODGE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 50th anniversary of the Fr. 
Capodanno Lodge. A part of The Order Sons 
of Italy in America, the oldest and largest 
Italian American fraternal association in the 
nation, the Lodge was originally chartered on 
November 9, 1971. Since 2007, the Lodge 
has been named after Fr. Capodanno, a 
Catholic chaplain from Staten Island who died 
in service in Vietnam. Like its namesake, the 
lodge has dedicated itself to the community, 
hosting social events, raising money for char-
ity, and offering scholarships. This September, 
the anniversary picnic will be celebrated con-
currently with the grand opening celebration of 
the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum in September. I 
congratulate the Lodge for their fifty years of 
service.

RECOGNIZING MEMBERS OF THE 
OHIO 
NATIONAL 
GUARD 
WHO 
ARE 
SERVING 
LORAIN 
FOODBANKS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize our fine men and women from 
the Ohio National Guard who have risen to a 
challenge on the home front as our commu-
nities wrestle with the effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. When our local foodbanks 
began to see increases in people needing 
food to feed themselves and their families, 
even as the pandemic imposed restrictions on 
staff and volunteers to help, we were able to 
work with the Ohio National Guard to send 
units to help distribute food to our neighbors. 
This food has been a lifeline to those served, 
who through no fault of their own were left job-
less, without funds, unsure of the future, and 
hungry. 
Truly, the Ohio National Guard lives up to 
its motto, ‘‘Always ready! Always there!’’, and 
we cannot thank them enough for their com-
passionate and brave service. 
Lorain Ohio’s Second Harvest Foodbank co-
ordinated with the Ohio National Guard’s 
SSgt. Danijel Vujicic and SSG Jacob Zieber, 
to serve the foodbank and its neighbors. They 
assisted in the coordination of the drive 
through mobile pantries and partnered with 
community organizations and law enforcement 
personnel in an effort to ensure that people 
were received food. The Ohio National Guard 
and its team helped the Second Harvest 
Foodbank of Lorain deliver 18.6 million 
pounds of food serving 172,000 unique indi-
viduals.

CONGRATU-
LATING 
BRIGADIER 
GENERAL 
JOHNNY S. LIZAMA ON THE OC-
CASION OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true public servant, Brigadier 
General Johnny S. Lizama, and congratulate 
him on his retirement from the Guam Air Na-
tional Guard after 43 years of service to our 
island and nation. 
After graduating from Father Duenas Memo-
rial School in 1977, Brigadier General Lizama 
remained determined for success and set his 
sights on a university degree. While earning 
his Bachelor of Arts in Business Management, 
he followed in the footsteps of his father, a 
Vietnam War-era sailor, and first enlisted with 
the Coast Guard Reserve on Guam. He then 
transitioned into active-duty status with the 
United States Air Force in 1982, where he 
was stationed at Eglin AFB, Florida and Beale 
AFB, California. Cognizant of the importance 
of both knowledge and experience, Brigadier 
General Lizama used the educational opportu-
nities offered by the military to assist in propel-
ling his career forward, As a graduate of the 
Air War College with a master’s degree in 
public administration from Golden Gate Uni-
versity and numerous other certifications and 
training under his belt, Brigadier General 
Lizama emerged as a pillar of leadership for 
our community and servicemembers with un-
wavering resolution. 
With recognitions such as a Small Arms 
Marksmanship Ribbon, Humanitarian Service 
Medal, Meritorious Unit Award, Army Achieve-
ment, Air Force Achievement, Air Force Com-
mendation, Meritorious Service Medal, and Le-
gion of Merit, Brigadier General Lizama’s 
countless awards and decorations only offer a 
glimpse of his character and long history in 
public service. By 1988, he returned to Guam 
to serve in our Air National Guard, where his 
work, achievements, and strategic under-
standing of Guam assisted in its development 
as a world-class organization. Humbly and 
steadily rising through the ranks, Brigadier 
General Lizama paved a path from machinery 
technician to interior electrician, manpower 
specialist, services specialist, and onto his first 
commission as an officer in 1992. 
His breadth of experience and specialties 
further equipped him with valuable tools to 
successfully lead in numerous other senior po-
sitions. In his role as former Homeland Secu-
rity Advisor for the Governor of Guam, Briga-
dier General Lizama advanced the safety and 
security of Guam as the frontline for all activi-
ties in our region. His drive and profes-
sionalism further paved the way for him to 
write history when, in 2016, he emerged as a 
pioneer and became the first Chamorro Air-
man to be promoted and federally recognized 
at the rank of brigadier general in the Guam 
Air National Guard and the United States Air 
Force. Through this position, he exercised 
control of all Guam Air-National Guard per-
sonnel, material and fiscal resources, and ad-
vised the Adjutant General on Guard func-
tions. As the Assistant Adjutant General and 
hand-picked Commander of the Guam Air Na-
tional Guard, he was also responsible for the 
strategic administration, coordination, plan-
ning, and development of policies and pro-
grams to ensure mission readiness units that 
serve local communities, State, and Nation, for 
both homeland and defense missions. 
Amid the COVID–19 pandemic, Brigadier 
General Lizama’s leadership has also been 
critical to our public and the Guam National 
Guard’s response to the dynamic needs of our 
government and community. Establishing yet 
another milestone for our community as the 
first Guam dual-status commander for Joint 
Task Force 671 appointed by the Secretary of 
Defense and the Governor of Guam, he 
oversaw the operations for all service mem-
bers, federal entities, and local agencies re-
sponding to the pandemic on the island. Fur-
ther working with Guam Homeland Security 
and FEMA to assess and plan current and fu-
ture operations and missions which target flat-
tening the curve, he embodies the definition of 
selflessness and fortitude. 
Throughout his journey and with every suc-
cess, Brigadier General Lizama has never 
failed to demonstrate the defining humility of a 
true servant leader. He credits his inspiration 
and achievements to his faith, the deep love 
he shares with his resilient parents and par-
ents-in-law, Eloy L.G. and Dolores S. Lizama, 
Tomas G. and Delores C. San Nicolas, Dee, 
his wife of over 37 years, their children, Major 
(USAF) Keith and his wife Paula-Jean, Lieu-
tenant (USN) Kimberly and her husband Jona-
than, Airman First Class (USAF) Cody and 
Rico, and his four grandchildren, Taehlyn- 
Jean, Urijah-John, Logan-James and Brendan- 
Jacob, and the sons and daughters of Guam. 
Brigadier General Johnny Lizama served 
our island and nation with much honor, ac-

greatest appreciation for his commitment to

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
PAUL O. REIMER 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Paul O. Reimer, a Cali-
fornia native who was born on July 15, 1927, 
and died on April 25, 2021, at his home in 
Portola Valley, California, at the age of 93. 
Paul was the only child of Ruby and Paul 
Reimer and was raised in Alturas, California. 
He enlisted in the Army at the age of 17 and 
was assigned to the University of Idaho to 
learn basic engineering. After basic training he 
was sent to Japan and Korea. After his WWII 
service, Paul earned a Civil Engineering de-
gree at the University of Nevada. It was at 
Reno that he met his wife, Kathryn Ann Bren-
nan, and where he developed strong loyalties 
to his professors and friends, and he was a 
very proud and supportive alum. 
Paul and Kathryn married in 1951 and 
moved to Palo Alto, California. They had three 
children, Mark, Ted (who died in 2018), and 
Kristie. Kay died in 2005, and Paul is survived 
by Mark and his wife Ana, daughter Kristie, 
seven grandchildren; 15 great-grandchildren, 
and many beloved nieces and nephews. 
Paul formed Reimer Associates, Consulting 
Civil Engineers, in 1976, and went far beyond 
engineering design services. He was joined at 
the firm by his daughter Kristie in 1990, and 
together they gained national recognition for 
their work with the communities impacted by 
the Base Realignment and Closure Com-
mittee. Paul was a member of the Defense 
Environmental Response Task Force and ap-
pointment to this nine-member Task Force re-
quired House and Senate confirmation. He 
was an active member of many professional 
societies and received many honors for his 
work. 
Paul gave back to his community through 
his work researching the path that Gaspar de 
Portola took during his 1769 expedition to the 
San Mateo and San Francisco County coasts, 
and through his long service with the Mid-Pe-
ninsula Regional Open Space District and the 
Peninsula Open Space Trust. 
Madam Speaker, Paul Reimer has been de-
scribed as a poet, a wit, a true gentleman, a 
gifted engineer, a gracious host, a best friend, 
and most importantly, a beloved husband, fa-
ther, grandfather, and godfather. He was a 
great and good man who made his community 
and his country better places for all of us. I 
ask the entire House of Representatives to 
join me in extending our most sincere condo-
lences to his family and in honoring the life of 
this extraordinary American.

SUB AND BOWL 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, to recognize the Sub and Bowl res-
taurant for their 20 years of service to the 
Golden Hill Office Center and its tenants. This 
local, minority-owned small business in Lake-
wood, Colo. will be closing after two decades 
of service. 
Sub and Bowl opened its doors in 2001 and 
has served the numerous tenants of the Gold-
en Hill Office Center with American and Ko-
rean meals for breakfast and lunch. It has sur-
vived quite a few challenges over the last 20 
years, including the Great Recession and 
most recently, the COVID 19 pandemic which 
kept workers home for many months. 
I want to recognize owners Jung and 
Michelle for their dedication and service to the 
tenants of the Golden Hill Office Center: My 
staff and I will miss their warm greetings, con-
versation and great food. 
I extend my gratitude to Jung and Michelle 
of the Sub and Bowl for their service to our 
community. I wish them the best in their move 
to Texas and all of their future endeavors.

IN HONOR OF COACH BOBBY L. 
WRIGHT 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, Jr. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor, commend and extend per-
sonal congratulations to my friend of long-
standing and my brother in Kappa Alpha Psi 
Fraternity, Inc., Coach Bobby L. Wright. Coach 
Wright, the beloved and renowned former 
Head Coach and Athletic Director at Central 
High School in Phenix City, Alabama, recently 
retired after 44 years as a highly respected 
coach, mentor and consultant. A retirement 
celebration was held in his honor on Friday, 
July 2, 2021 at Green Island Country Club in 
Columbus, Georgia. 
Bobby L. Wright graduated from Buena 
Vista High School in Marion County, Georgia 
in 1970 and from Fort Valley State College 
(now Fort Valley State University) in 1974. 
The following year, he began his stellar teach-
ing and coaching careers at Carver High 
School in Columbus, Georgia serving as the 
Head Coach for track and Assistant Coach for 
football and basketball. In 1977, he was re-
cruited and hired across the Chattahoochee 
River at Central High School in Phenix City, 
Alabama where he taught, coached, and 
chaired the Health and Physical Education De-
partment. There, for 12 years he served as an 
Assistant Coach under the tutelage of famed 
Coach James Redd before taking over as the 
Head Coach. 
During his impressive 32-year tenure as 
Head Coach for the Central High School Boys 
Varsity Basketball Team, ‘‘The Red Devils’’ he 
amassed an incredible record of achievement: 
4 State Championship game appearances; 8 
semi-final appearances; 26 playoff appear-
ances; and winning 8 region titles and 23 area 
titles. Coach Wright had a 671–221 won-loss 
record with his 600th win being against 
archrival Auburn High School in 2017. Concur-
rently, he served as the Defensive Coordinator 
for the Central High School football team for 
26 years, including in 1993 when they won the 
Alabama State High School Football Cham-
pionship title. In addition to that, Coach Wright 
served as the school’s Athletic Director from 
1998 until his retirement earlier this year. 
Aristotle once said, ‘‘Educating the mind 
without educating the heart is no education at 
all.’’ Coach Wright was an educator of both. 
He is rooted in the belief that children need 
tough love as well as encouragement. As 
such, he was known for his discipline-first ap-
proach when coaching basketball, football, 
and track. He used this firm coaching style to 
motivate the athletes under his direction to do 
their best and met them with laughter and 
support even if they missed the mark. 
Coach 
Wright 
has 
received 
countless 
awards and commendations for his achieve-
ments and accomplishments as a coach and 
educator, including a resolution on January 
21, 2021 approved by the Phenix City Ala-
bama Board of Education honoring his long 
and exemplary service to the Phenix City 
School system. But none is more impressive 
than his 2014 induction into the Alabama High 
School Athletic Hall of Fame. 
Coach Wright has accomplished much in his 
life but none of it would have been possible 
without the grace of God; the love and support 
of his wife of almost three decades, Carolyn; 
his family, students and the communities in 
Georgia and Alabama, to which he has given 
so much. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of the Second Congressional 
District, in extending our sincerest apprecia-
tion, our heartfelt congratulations and our best 
wishes to Coach Bobby L. Wright upon the oc-
casion of his retirement after an outstanding 
44 years impacting the lives of the countless 
people he has touched.

they have two adult sons and six grand-

zebo Lake Ranch. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Colonel Paul L. Willis for his 
passion and dedication for success and desire 
to make a difference in the community.

IN MEMORY OF LARRY LARISON 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, my heart is heavy as I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend, Hoyt Hum-
phreys ‘‘Larry’’ Larison, who passed away on 
December 11, 2020. My prayers are with 
Larry’s family as we mourn his passing. 
Born and raised in Montana, Larry was a 
lifelong member of the Pacific Northwest com-
munity who later planted his roots in Eastern 
Washington. This is how I got to know Larry 
as a leader and strong champion for education 
and entrepreneurship. 
Larry committed his life to creating opportu-
nities for the next generation of American 
leaders, serving on the Whitworth University 
School of Business Advisory Board in Spo-
kane and sponsoring multiple annual scholar-
ships for students across the region. 
Larry was generous with not only his finan-
cial contributions but also his time and wis-
dom, playing an active role in various organi-
zations throughout his life. He served as 
Chairman of the Republican National Com-
mittee Small Business Advisory Council under 
President Ronald Reagan, Director of Finance 
and Governance Committees for Spokane

nance and Marketing Committee for the Spo-
kane County Boys and Girls Clubs, to name a 
few. 
Larry always felt indebted to have these op-
portunities in life and never took anything for 
granted. He had an amazing impact on the 
lives of so many in Eastern Washington, and 
I was grateful for his friendship and insights. 
I will never forget his passion for being out-
doors and enjoying God’s beautiful creations 
in the Western United States. Above all, I will 
always remember how proud Larry was to be 
an American. He embodied the American spirit 
by seizing every opportunity and encouraging 
others to chase their dreams. He always gave 
time and encouragement to everyone he 
knew, and we are better for his impact on our 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, Larry Larison lived an 
amazing life that deserves to be celebrated. In 
honor of Larry’s legacy, passion, and contribu-
tions that inspired so many, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Larry 
Larison. May God grant him eternal peace in 
His kingdom.

ROBERT (BOB) COX 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Robert (Bob) E. Cox of 
Lakewood, Colorado who passed away on 
June 25, 2021. 
Bob grew up in Denver and graduated from 
East High School. He experienced other parts 
of the country before returning to Denver, 
where he finished his career in 1999. He re-
tired in Santa Fe, New Mexico where he re-
built an adobe home on the Chama River. He 
briefly attended the University of Miami and 
then studied political science and journalism at 
CU Boulder. During his career, he worked as 
editor of the Colorado Daily, a correspondent 
and regional executive at United Press Inter-
national, politics reporter at the San Diego 
Union, managing editor at the Colorado Busi-
ness Magazine, politics writer at the Rocky 
Mountain News, editor at Weekly Newspaper 
in Glenwood Springs, and editor of the Green 
Mountain Gazette. He also served as press 
secretary for Tim Wirth’s first U.S. House of 
Representatives campaign in 1974. 
In 1991, he and his wife, Sid O’Connell, pur-
chased the Jefferson County weeklies and 
formed a partnership with other Denver subur-
ban newspapers. The weeklies covered the 
western suburbs of Denver including Lake-
wood, Wheat Ridge and Arvada. The Coxes 
led their news and advertising teams to win 
many Colorado Press Association awards be-
fore selling the papers in 1999. 
Bob kept a sharp eye on the doings of 
elected officials, which was apparent in his 
many editorial columns. He coached his re-
porters to take time to dig for information and 
filled his editorials with directness yet wit and 
humor. Former staffers noted Bob’s continual 
efforts to make time for some fun in the high- 
intensity work of news reporting as well as the 
high-level of respect many inside and outside 
of the journalism community had for Bob. He 
enjoyed lively conversations and kept folks on 
their toes with questions. 
In 2017, the dean of the College of Media, 
Communications and Journalism at CU Boul-
der, in an official ceremony, recognized Bob’s 
life’s 
accomplishments 
and 
retroactively 
awarded Bob a bachelor’s degree in jour-
nalism, despite him being a couple of credits 
short in 1968. 
Upon Bob’s passing, his son, Kennedy Cox, 
said he felt he had lost his best friend. The fa-
ther and son enjoyed engaging in musical en-
deavors—especially guitar—and traveling on 
the road to have semi-philosophical conversa-
tions and spend time together. 
Bob is survived by his son; former wife, 
Sidnie O’Connell of Lakewood; sister Lynn 
Murphy of Seattle, Washington; niece Amie 
Servais of Sammamish, Washington; nephew 
Baxter Baldwin of Scottsdale, Arizona; and 
several great nieces and nephews. I am deep-
ly grateful for his lifetime of service to our 
community.

HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor William J. Castello. Born in 
1957, a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis left him 
spending much of his childhood indoors. One 
day he found a box of graphite lead sticks and 
began to faithfully reproduce the cover por-
traits of LOOK and LIFE magazine on typing 
paper, beginning his long love of art. Starting 
with his first public showing at the East 
Flatbush Public Library at the age of 9, he has 
been featured at Columbia University, the 
Newseum, and the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum 
in Staten Island. After marrying his childhood 
sweetheart, Maria Loccisano, he went on to 
work for the Associated Press as an artist. He 
is now an honorary associate of the Ancient 
Order of Hibernians, a Fourth-degree Knight 
and Past Grand Knight of the Knights of Co-
lumbus, and now, the Immediate Past Presi-
dent of the Fr. Capodanno Lodge of the Sons 
and Daughters of Italy in America. He and 
Maria have made their home in Staten Island 
since 1986 and have been an active part of 
the community since then.

RECOGNIZING COLONEL GARY M. 
HAUSMAN 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Colonel Gary M. Hausman on his 
departure from the Defense Language Institute 
Foreign Language Center. 
Col. Hausman was commissioned in the 
U.S. Army in 1994 as a Military Intelligence 
Officer from the University of California, Irvine. 
He was initially assigned to the 4th Infantry Di-
vision at Fort Carson, Colorado and served as 
a MI Platoon Leader, Assistant Battalion Intel-
ligence Officer, HQ Company EO, Battalion In-
telligence Officer, and Company Commander. 
Throughout his well-decorated military ca-
reer, Col. Hausman demonstrated exceptional 
leadership and dutifully upheld the seven core 
values of the U.S. Army. Because of these at-
tributes, Col. Hausman was competitively se-
lected for many prestigious assignments and 
postings, including Cryptologic Services Group 
Officer in Charge at the Joint Special Oper-
ations Command at Fort Bragg, North Caro-
lina; Battalion Operations Office and Executive 
Officer for the 525th Battlefield Surveillance 
Brigade; Liaison Officer in support of the Spe-
cial Operations Joint Task Force—Afghani-
stan; Liaison Officer for Joint Special Oper-
ations Command for the NSA in Fort Meade, 
Maryland; assuming command of the 743rd 
Military Intelligence Battalion, Buckley Air 
Force Base, Denver, CO; and as the Execu-
tive Officer to the Commanding General of 
Army Cyber Command and then the Deputy 
Chief of Staff, U.S. Cyber Command. 
During these assignments, Col. Hausman 
deployed several times to Operation Iraqi 
Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, 
demonstrating bravery and a commitment to 
democracy in our global fight against ter-
rorism. 
In June of 2018, Col. Hausman was ap-
pointed as Commandant for the Defense Lan-
guage Institute Language Center and Presidio 
of Monterey, California. During his tenure, he 
oversaw the finest foreign language instruction 
of approximately 2,500 soldiers, marines, sail-
ors, and airmen, as well as select Department 
of 
Defense 
and 
State 
members. 
Col. 
Hausman’s contributions to the Central Coast 
of California extend beyond the Defense Lan-
guage Institute—he contributes to and sup-
ports our culture of service, learning, and com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, Colonel Gary M. Hausman 
is an outstanding Army officer and model cit-
izen who has served with honor throughout his 
nearly three decades of service. I ask my col-
leagues in the House to join me in honoring 
him today.

Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Warren County Sheriff’s Of-
fice, Richardsville Volunteer Fire Department, 
and Warren County Emergency Management 
Office. These local responders provide ex-
traordinary services to protect all who visit and 
call Warren County home. 
First responders in Warren County have

even with the added threat of COVID–19. The 
Warren County Sheriff’s Office, led by Sheriff 
Brett Hightower, plays an important role in 
keeping drugs out of the community, safe-
guarding local schools, and much more. The 
Richardsville Fire Department with Chief Brian 
Lee manages multiple fire stations to quickly

HONORING CHESTER HENDERSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Mr. Chester Henderson. 
Mr. Henderson was born on May 26, 1918 
in Webb, Mississippi. After the passing of his 
father, he had to quit school in the fourth 
grade in order to help his mother support their 
family. 
At an early age, Mr. Henderson worked for 
Mississippi Valley Gas Company and then at 
Mississippi Power and Light Company (cur-
rently known as Entergy) before being drafted 
into the United States Army, during World War 
II. Under General George Patton, he served in 
Northern Africa, Italy, and Germany as a truck 
driver during the famous Redhull Express Op-
erations, consisting of predominately African 
American drivers that delivered over 6,000 
gallons of fuel 24 hours a day, with routes in 
excess of 400 miles in each direction. 
After a short courtship, he married the love 
of his life, Victoria Anderson, on New Year’s 
Eve 1944. Together they built a home in 
Cleveland, Mississippi, on Church Street, and 
became the proud parents of six children. 
They spent 42 years of marriage together, 
until the passing of Mrs. Henderson in 1987. 
After serving honorably, he was discharged 
in 1945. He was able to return to his job at 
Mississippi Power and Light Company, where 
he worked from 1946 until he retired in 1983. 
When not working, he loved gardening and 
growing vegetables, which he and his wife 
would can, freeze, and share with many— 
friends, neighbors, co-workers, and church 
family. He would also help his neighbors out 
in their gardens and by manicuring their yards. 
St. 
Peter’s 
Rock 
Mississionary 
Baptist 
Church is where Mr. Henderson gave his life 
to Jesus Christ, and was baptized in August of 
1946 in a sandpit in Boyle, Mississippi, by the 
late Rev. L. L. Laws. He has served as a dea-
con, an usher and a choir member. His love 
for St. Peter’s Rock and the current pastor, 
Rev. Terrence Rash, has led many of his 
grandchildren to accept Jesus Christ at this 
church. 
Mr. 
Henderson’s 
dedication 
has 
blessed him with the title of ‘‘Oldest Member’’ 
since 2017, and it has shown him as an up-
standing pillar in his family and community. 
Mr. Henderson was born when Woodrow 
Wilson was President of the United States of 
America and Theodore G. Bilbo was Governor 
of the State of Mississippi. His life has 
spanned the administration of 19 United 
States Presidents, from Woodrow Wilson to 
Joe Biden; and 26 Mississippi Governors, from 
Theodore G. Bilbo to Tate Reeves. This family 
icon has witnessed many historic events dur-
ing his lifetime, including the Great Depres-
sion, World War II, and man’s walk on the 
moon. He is truly blessed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Chester Henderson for 
his dedication to serving his family, community 
and this nation.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise

Mr. Rogers served honorably as an Air Po-
liceman in the U.S. Air Force from 1960 to 
1964. After retiring from his decades-long civil-
ian career as a Vice President of Sales & Mar-
keting, Mr. Rogers joined the American Legion 
in 2008. Mr. Rogers’ leadership roles at mul-
tiple North Texas posts in The Colony, McKin-
ney, and Frisco led to him receiving numerous 
post, district, division, department, and na-
tional awards. 
Mr. Rogers is a founding post member and 
has served as the Commander of Post 178 for 
the past seven years. His tireless efforts to 
bolster the new post’s community involvement 
and promote its membership led to Post 178 
earning the Texas Post Excellence Award for 
four consecutive years from 2016 through 
2019. The post also earned the National Post 
Excellence Award for three consecutive years 
from 2016 through 2018. Despite the post’s 
recent founding, it is one of the most recog-
nized and fastest growing in the state of 
Texas. The post also recently earned recogni-
tion for establishing a Membership All-Time 
High for seven consecutive years from 2015 
through 2021. 
Under his leadership as Post Commander, 
Post 178 has organized Memorial and Vet-
erans Day events, sponsored dozens of high 
school juniors for American Legion Boys 
State, promoted the annual American Legion 
High School Oratorical Scholarship contest, 
worked alongside the Wreaths Across America 
organization at the Dallas-Fort Worth National 
Cemetery and contributed to many other com-
munity events and celebrations. I join Post 
178 and the Frisco community in thanking Mr. 
Rogers for his devoted service to our veterans 
and his fellow citizens. He is truly an out-
standing model of selfless civic service. 
GORDON BEESLEY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Arvada Police 
Officer Gordon Beesley, who was killed in the 
line of duty on June 21, 2021. 
On June 21, 2021, Officer Beesley was re-
sponding to a report of suspicious activity in 
Olde Town Arvada, Colo. when he was am-
bushed and shot by a man who had immense 
hatred toward police. 
Officer Beesley joined the Arvada Police 
Department in 2002 and served in a number 
of roles for the Department. He spent most of 
the year working as a school resource officer 
at local schools in our community, including 
Oberon Middle School, Lincoln Academy and 
Excel Academy Charter School. During the 
summers, he often returned to patrol work. 
Officer Beesley was a well-known and well- 
liked member of our community. His calm, 
gentle and patient demeanor made a big dif-
ference in his day-to-day interactions with stu-
dents, especially those students who needed it 
most. In 2015, he was named Employee of 
the Year by the City of Arvada after the city 
learned Officer Beesley was riding his bike to 
school multiple times a week with a student 
who suffered from developmental delays and 
was not able to ride by himself. Countless 
other stories have surfaced from students, his 
colleagues and community members in the 
days following his death about the impact he 
had on their lives, big and small. 
Officer Beesley is the first member of the 
Arvada Police Department to be killed by gun-
fire in the line of duty and the second police 
officer killed in the line of duty in Colorado in 
2021. 
I want to extend my deepest and heartfelt 
condolences to Officer Beesley’s family, the 
Arvada Police Department and the entire Ar-
vada community for this tragic incident and the 
loss of Officer Beesley. We will remember Of-
ficer Gordon Beesley for his kindness and 
bravery, and are forever indebted to him and 
his family for his service and sacrifice for our 
community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
PROTEIN 
DATA 
BANK 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the 
Protein Data Bank (PDB) in the United States 
and its outsized impact on the scientific com-
munity. Established at Brookhaven National 
Laboratory in 1971, the PDB was created be-
cause researchers were unable to share the 
valuable information they collected due to the 
lack of advanced computer systems at that 
time. The PDB solved this problem by serving 
as a depository for three-dimensional struc-
tures of large, biological molecules—such as 
proteins, DNA, and RNA—and offered the 
data free of charge or restrictions on usage to 
individual researchers across the world. Since 
1998, I am proud to say the PDB has been 
co-managed by Rutgers, The State University 
of New Jersey. Today, the PDB archive in 
America hosts more than 180,000 structures 
of molecules found in all living organisms on 
the planet and is part of a worldwide network 
with other data centers in Europe and Asia. 
The PDB’s legacy as the first open-access 
digital data resource in biology and medicine 
has led to countless breakthroughs and has 
democratized access to data in a way that has 
tremendously benefited the public. Each year, 
millions of researchers, scientists, educators, 
students, medical professionals, patients, pa-
tient advocates as well as pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies around the world uti-
lize the PDB for basic and applied research, 
STEM education, and the discovery of life-
saving medicines, particularly anti-viral and 
anti-cancer drugs. Examples of its profound 
impact include the more than two million struc-
ture data file downloads it generates per day; 
its contribution to over one million published 
research papers; and its enabling of research 
in many subject areas, ranging from Agri-
culture to Zoology. 
But this ambitious project would not have 
been possible without significant federal in-
vestment in scientific research. The National 
Science Foundation, the Department of En-
ergy, and the National Institutes of Health all 
contribute funding to the PDB, which gen-
erates a return on investment 1,500 times 
more than federal dollars it receives. This kind 
of investment clearly demonstrates the impor-
tance of the government-university research 
partnership and why it is critical that we main-
tain and strengthen that partnership to bolster 
American innovation and competitiveness for 
years to come. 
In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I offer my 
congratulations to the PDB in the United 
States as it celebrates its first 50 years as a 
leading global resource for experimental data 
central to scientific discovery, and I look for-
ward to its contributions to science and our 
society over the next 50 years.

RECOGNIZING 
BARBARA 
TETREAULT’S SERVICE TO NEW 
HAMPSHIRE 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Barbara Tetreault, long-time Editor of 
the Berlin Daily Sun newspaper, on her well- 
deserved retirement. Barbara has been with 
the paper since 1993 and the Editor since 
2013. Her departure will be an end of an era. 
The city of Berlin and the paper have both 
struggled over the years, yet Barbara’s con-
stant, dedicated, professional reporting has al-
ways presented the news in a candid and 
transparent manner to the people of Berlin. 
With New Hampshire’s First in the Nation pri-
mary status, Barbara was there to ask the 
hard questions of candidates in the earliest 
days of their campaigns. Barbara’s questions, 
often repeated across the state and country 
during the campaign, would help define the 
creditability and integrity of many candidates. 
As Barbara steps back from the deadline to 
a slower pace, The Berlin Daily Sun will take 
on a new Editor who will put their stamp on 
the masthead. We know we will, occasionally, 
still see Barbara’s name at the end of a col-
umn in the paper. 
It is with great pleasure that I recognize and 
give honor to this wonderful woman who kept 
her community informed about the news of 
Berlin and the North Country.

H.R. 3243 would codify the role of the 
Transportation 
Security 
Administration 
(TSA) as the administrator of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s program to 
protect pipelines from terrorists and cyber-
security threats. The bill would require TSA 
to create a new executive position, develop a 
personnel strategy to improve the effective-
ness of the pipeline security program, and re-
port on its progress annually. Finally, H.R. 
3243 would require the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) to review the bill’s im-
plementation within two years of enactment. 
Many of the bill’s requirements are con-
sistent with activities being conducted under 
current law and would not significantly af-
fect the agency’s costs. Using information 
from TSA, CBO estimates that implementing 
other provisions of the bill would cost $2 mil-
lion over the 2021–2026 period. About half of 
that amount would stem from required per-
sonnel changes at review. Any spending 
would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Aaron Krupkin. The estimate was reviewed 
by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of 
Budget Analysis.

the youngest of three children. He is a 1979 
graduate of Coffeeville High School, and a 
1983 graduate of Alcorn State University, with 
a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture 
Education/Agronomy. Eddie has a Master of 
Science degree from Mississippi State Univer-
sity (1991) in Agriculture and Extension Edu-
cation. 
Eddie is married to Annie Scott Harris 
(1985) and they have two children, Anika, and 
Ashley and two grandchildren. Anika has a 
B.S. and a M.S. from Mississippi State Univer-
sity. Anika is employed with the United States 
Department of Defense (Civilian) at Keesler 
Air Force Base in Biloxi, MS. Ashley has a 
B.S. from Alcorn State University and is a nu-
tritionist with Mississippi State Department of 
Health. 
Eddie’s career has taken him in many direc-
tions, first as a Vocational Agriculture Instruc-
tor in Durant, MS. He also worked for Mis-
sissippi State University Extension Service for 
28 years, with 24 of those years in Humphreys 
County, MS. 
He has held several positions with Mis-
sissippi State University: 4–H Youth Agent; 
Assistant County Agent; County Agriculture 
Agent/County Leader; and District Soybean 
Agent. 
Eddie was the first black County Agricultural 
Agent in Humphreys County, MS. He was only 
27 years of age when this monumental task 
was offered to him. Throughout all the chal-
lenges, he became a successful Extension 
Agent with farmers, youth, and community 
leaders. 
Eddie retired from Mississippi State Univer-
sity Extension Service in 2009. He is most 
proud of when he was able to encourage mi-
nority youth to participate in exhibiting 4–H 
livestock in Humphreys County, MS. These 
youth exhibited their animals (hogs and cattle) 
at the County District and the Dixie National 
Livestock shows. These minority youth won 
many scholarships to help them with their col-
lege expenses, and they gained many life 
skills. 
Eddie has received many awards during his 
career: 
Distinguished Service Award—National As-
sociation of County Agricultural Agents. 
Soybean Agent of the Year—Mississippi As-
sociation of County Agricultural Agents. 
Swine Agent of the Year—MS Swine Pro-
ducers Association. 
Paul F. Newell Award—Outstanding Agent; 
MS Cattleman Association. 
Hunter Education Instructor of the Year— 
MS Department of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks. 
Eddie is a people person, and he gets along 
well with others. One of his former bosses 
said, ‘‘If you can’t get along with Eddie you 
can’t get along with anybody.’’ 
Eddie moved back to his hometown of 
Coffeeville, MS, in 2010 after a long career in 
Agriculture and decided to get into politics. He 
is presently a Board of Supervisor member in 
Yalobusha County, MS, representing District 
4. His goals as a County Supervisor are to 
bring his many years of leadership skills to 
this position. Eddie is focusing on repairing 
and maintaining roads and bridges, developing 
industries, and being fiscally responsible for 
the people’s tax dollars. 
Eddie’s parents taught him that you must re-
spect yourself before others will respect you, 
to work hard and others will notice, and place 
God first in your life. 
Eddie is a member of Bethlehem M. B. 
Church in Coffeeville, MS. He is the adult 
Sunday School Teacher and Chairman of the 
Deacon Board. 
Eddie is proud of his many accomplish-
ments, but more importantly to help people 
help themselves, through leadership and his 
amazing people skills.

BETTY THOMPSON 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, Saint Louis 
and I rise to commemorate the life of Ms. 
Betty Thompson. Ms. Betty was a deeply be-
loved figure in St. Louis, not only for her 
groundbreaking political career and trailblazing 
civil rights work, but most notably for her warm 
and giving spirit. Her altruistic reach tran-
scended the chaos of politics and gave space 
for the beauty in public service. She remained 
true to her values and led from a place of 
service and deep love of community. This ap-
proach to her work led her to opening so 
many doors in politics for our region as a bar-
rier-breaking politician who was the first Black 
woman to serve on the University City City 
council. Not only did she open doors, but she 
extended her hand to bring the next genera-
tion of leaders along with her. Her passion 
and vigor was ever present, as she famously 
said, ‘‘We want you to wake up! Get up! Sit 
up! Look up! Dress up! Eat up! Pray up! Pay 
up! And if you can’t do that, then you should 
just stay home and shut up!’’ 
She so beautifully took issues that most 
pained her, like her struggle with alopecia, and 
turned them into positive change in her legis-
lative efforts. Ms. Thompson sponsored legis-
lation that created a pathway for children with 
alopecia to receive hairpieces. This legislation 
was essential to Medicaid developing a policy 
that gave provision for expenses related to 
scalp prosthesis. 
This, along with so many other efforts of 
Representative Thompson, are a wonderful 
depiction of the vigor and depth with which 
she loved her community. That love will un-
questionably be widely missed—but it was a 
love so genuine it will most certainly leave rip-
pling effects for years to come. So though we 
mourn her loss, we also celebrate her life. It 
was a life well lived indeed.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE 
EVELYN WRIGHT TURNER PUGH 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an ex-
traordinary public servant, wife, mother and 
dear friend of longstanding to many, the Hon-
orable Evelyn Wright Turner Pugh. Sadly, Ms. 
Pugh passed away on Saturday, July 10, 
2021. A memorial celebration of her life will be 
held at 11:00 am, Monday July 19, 2021 at 
Revelation Baptist Church, 203 R.C. Allen 
Drive, Columbus, Georgia. 
A native of Columbus, Evelyn Wright was 
born on June 23, 1950 to the late Willie ‘‘Son’’ 
Wright and Mary Pearl Haynes. She attended 
George Washington Carver High School, grad-
uating in 1968. Upon graduation she married 
Marcus ‘‘Pancho’’ Turner and they had 2 sons, 
Marcus Deon and Maurice. Determined to pre-
pare herself for an amazing career, she at-
tended Columbus College (now Columbus 
State University) where she received her As-
sociate’s degree in Secretarial Science, a 
Bachelor’s in Management/Accounting and a 
Master’s in Business Administration. Beginning 
her career as a secretary at Columbus Col-
lege and Progressive Funeral Home she 
earned her tuition and was mentored by Co-
lumbus icon, Mr. George Washington Ford, 
being inspired by his example of selfless serv-
ice in helping others. 
Evelyn gained employment at Blue Cross 
Blue Shield of Georgia and rose quickly 
through the ranks holding a plethora of posi-
tions ranging from entry level to managerial 
across a span of 30 years. In 1999 she was 
appointed Vice President of Sun Trust Bank, 
West Georgia, a position she held until her re-
tirement from the banking industry in 2012. 
When her marriage ended in divorce, she 
successfully managed her roles as mother and 
business executive but felt a calling to serve 
her community. Growing out of a group of 
young adults concerned about conditions in 
the Columbus community, ‘‘People For A 
Cause’’, Evelyn offered herself for public office 
and in 1988 was elected to the City Council of 
Columbus where she served for 30 years, 14 
as Mayor Pro Tem, working to improve the 
quality of life for the people of Columbus. 
Due to her strong leadership and dedication 
to public service, she was selected for numer-
ous other responsibilities. She was appointed 
by Governor Zell Miller to the Georgia Policy 
Council on Children and Families; to the Uni-
versity of Georgia Carl Vinson Institute of Gov-
ernment Advisory Committee; and the Mental 
Health Mental Retardation Substance Abuse 
Funding Study Committee. She was appointed 
Chair of the National League of Cities’ Public 
Safety and Crime Prevention Steering Com-
mittee, working with U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno on the use of grants from the 
Community Oriented Policing Services Pro-
gram; was elected Georgia Chair of Women in 
Municipal Government; President of the Geor-
gia Municipal Association and Board of Direc-
tors of the National League of Cities. 
And if that was not enough, she continued 
service on local boards, including the Board of 
Directors of Girls, Inc.; St. Francis Hospital; 
Columbus Technical College; Liberty Theater 
and Muscogee Educational Excellence Foun-
dation. She was a faithful member of the Co-
lumbus Chapter of The Links, Inc.; and Co-
lumbus Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma 
Theta Sorority, Inc., serving as Treasurer and 
Financial Secretary. She was awarded the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Unity Award, among 
other distinguished honors, including being 
named by Georgia Trend Magazine as one of 
Georgia’s top public servants. Moreover, she 
served as Treasurer for my political campaign 
committees, both State and Federal, for over 
4 decades and was a trusted friend. 
Evelyn was a devoted sister, mother, grand-
mother, aunt, mentor and friend to many. She 
poured herself into her sons, Deon and Mau-
rice. She found love later in life, married the 
late Lieutenant Colonel (Ret) Reginald Pugh

and lovingly embraced her new blended fam-
ily, 
including 
Reggie, 
Jr., 
Tijuana 
and 
Talender. She was proud of all of her grand-
children and doted in their every achievement. 
Evelyn loved God and served him through-
out her life in various capacities through 
Holsey Chapel CME Church, Fourth Street 
Baptist Church and Revelation Baptist Church. 
Shirley Chisholm often said that ‘‘Service is 
the rent that we pay for the space we occupy 
on this earth’’. Evelyn paid her rent and she 
paid it well. She gave so much to so many for 
so long and continued until she could give no 
more. Columbus, the State of Georgia, our na-
tion and all those whose lives she touched are 
better because of her. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join my wife 
Vivian and me, along with the residents of the 
2nd Congressional District of Georgia in pay-
ing tribute to The Honorable Evelyn Wright 
Turner Pugh for her service and in extending 
our deepest condolences to her family, friends 
and all who mourn her loss. Moreover, we 
pray that we will all be consoled and com-
forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks and months ahead.

Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of two remarkable young 
women from my Congressional District, Jac-
queline Teague and Amelie Beck. After wit-
nessing their grandparents struggle to sign up 
for the COVID–19 vaccine, Jacqueline and 
Amelie created the program VaxConnectKY to 
help seniors make vaccination appointments 
online. Between their classes at Sacred Heart 
Academy, they answered emails and calls 
from seniors across the Commonwealth and 
guided them through the vaccination process. 
Since February, Jacqueline and Amelie 
have helped more than 2,000 seniors receive 
the COVID–19 vaccine. In recognition of this 
outstanding work, Jacqueline received the 
2021 Diana Award, which honors young peo-
ple around the world for their humanitarian ef-
forts. 
On behalf of the people of Kentucky’s Third

life-saving service and leadership. They are 
both incredible role models, and l have no

RECOGNIZING MR. TIMOTHY 
GONCHAROFF 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
honor 
and 
recognize 
Mr. 
Timothy 
Goncharoff, an instrumental environmental ad-
vocate, on his retirement from his position as 
the Zero Waste Programs Manager for Santa 
Cruz County. 
Mr. Goncharoff has been an environmental 
champion and leader on California’s Central 
Coast since the first Earth Day more than fifty 
years ago. His advocacy dates back to the 
creation of the Santa Cruz Greenbelt in 1979, 
an initiative that preserved open space and 
ensured future development in the rapidly ex-
panding areas of Santa Cruz, which included 
adequate affordable housing. He also played 
an instrumental role in the designation of Mon-
terey Bay as the 11th national marine sanc-
tuary in 1992. 
Mr. Goncharoff has always been committed 
to reducing the impact of plastic pollution; he 
wrote the world’s first law banning plastic 
straws, and authored ordinances restricting 
plastic bags and harmful styrofoam products. 
The impacts of Mr. Goncharoff’s work can 
be seen beyond Santa Cruz County. A law au-
thored by Mr. Goncharoff inspired Starbucks 
to establish its policy of only using recyclable 
and compostable products in thousands of lo-
cations worldwide. His ordinance creating a 
drug and sharps takeback program paid for by 
the pharmaceutical industry inspired a state-
wide law now rolling out across California. 
Further, his initiative to reduce single-use per-
sonal care products in hotels led to a new 
statewide law in California and changing 
standards in hotels around the world. 
During his time as the Zero Waste Pro-
grams Manager for Santa Cruz County, Mr. 
Goncharoff developed dozens of environ-
mental protection laws that have improved the 
environmental outlook of the county, and 
served as examples for countless cities, coun-
ties, and states. 
Mr. Goncharoff has fought for a sustainable 
and equitable future for Santa Cruz County 
and his leadership has inspired others to do 
their part to address the climate crisis. Mr. 
Goncharoff’s work has been honored by Gov-
ernor Jerry Brown with the presentation of the 
Governor’s 
Economic 
and 
Environmental 
Leadership Award, and by local environmental 
advocates Save Our Shores with their Ocean 
Hero Award. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Goncharoff is an out-
standing community leader and environmental 
advocate whose work has influenced those 
around the world to save our precious re-
sources and create a brighter and more sus-
tainable future. I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring him here today.

HONORING LEONCE YOUNG 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious community advocate, Mr. Leonce 
Young. Leonce has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
serve others. 
Leonce Young, a native of South Louisiana, 
enrolled in Louisiana State University with as-
pirations to pursue an engineering degree; 
however, he felt that was not his destiny. He 
instead opted to join the United States military 
serving in the Navy and Marines for a total of 
22 years. 
Officer Young’s desire to join law enforce-
ment began while in the active military. He ac-
companied a friend during a ride-along in 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and that experience 
ignited the fire in him to pursue a career in law 
enforcement. 
Now a retired military veteran, Leonce has 
served the Vicksburg Police Department for 
the past 26 years in various roles including: 
patrolman, motor officer, K–9 officer, and 
crash investigator. During his stint with Vicks-
burg Police Department, Leonce has received 
many 
awards 
and 
recognitions 
including 
Vicksburg/Warren Benevolent Police Officer of 
the Year, Motorcycle Instructor certification 
from Maryland State Police, accident recon-
struction certification, and Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration/UAS Remote Drone Pilot certifi-
cation. 
Young said, ‘‘The most rewarding thing 
about the work I do is helping people in the 
community, especially the young children and 
older adults. However, I feel the most chal-
lenging thing about law enforcement is sepa-
rating family members from their loved ones 
due to incidents that could have been pre-
vented.’’ 
Young believes that to be a good law en-
forcement officer, one must have compassion 
for others, the ability to think quickly under 
stressful situations, good communication skills 
and, above all, integrity. 
Leonce is married with two adult children 
and his favorite pastime is riding his motor-
cycle along the scenic highways. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Leonce Young for his 
passion and desire to make a difference in the 
community.

H.R. 3264 would authorize the Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS) to identify and 
analyze potential threats to infrastructure, 
industries, technologies, and intellectual 
property critical to the economic security of 
the United States. The agency would be re-
quired to report its findings and rec-
ommendations to the Congress annually 
through 2026. 
The bill would authorize the appropriation 
of $1 million each year from 2022 through 
2026 to carry out the new requirements. 
Using historical patterns of spending for 
similar programs and assuming appropria-
tion of the authorized amounts, CBO esti-
mates that implementing H.R. 3264 would 
cost $3 million over the 2021–2026 period and 
$2 million after 2026.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE DENTON 
COUNTY COVID–19 VACCINATION 
PROGRAM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the contributions of the individ-
uals, agencies, corporations, and organiza-
tions that made the Denton County, Texas 
COVID–19 vaccine distribution program pos-
sible. This massive undertaking was accom-
plished through the collective efforts of the 
Denton County Public Health Department, 
Denton 
County 
Emergency 
Management, 
County Judge Andy Eads and the Denton 
County Commissioners Court, the Denton 
County Medical Reserve Corps, and thou-
sands of corporate and private citizen volun-
teers. Thanks to the selfless service of these 
groups and individuals, our community’s vac-
cine distribution was not only highly success-
ful, but seminal in providing a distribution 
model for Texas and across the country. 
In particular, I would like to recognize the 
success of the Texas Motor Speedway (TMS) 
Denton County Mass Vaccination Site. The 
concept of an efficient drive-through vaccine 
delivery model was initially tested beginning in 
January 2021 at Denton ISD’s C.H. Collins 
Stadium with the vaccination of over 12,000 
individuals. Eddie Gossage, President of 
Texas Motor Speedway (TMS), offered the 
huge outdoor facility for the county’s distribu-
tion efforts. Due to excellent planning, prepa-
ration and staging by Denton County’s Health 
and Emergency Management and the exem-
plary diligence of 8,350 civilian volunteers, the 
TMS mass vaccination clinic, during its period 
of operation from February to May 2021, vac-
cinated over 375,000 North Texans. On March 
16, 2021, the TMS clinic broke the national 
record for the most individuals vaccinated in a 
9.5 hour period, with 12,927 vaccinations. The 
mass clinic also broke another record for a 10- 
hour period on April 29, with 17,004 vaccina-
tions. Amidst these record-breaking clinics, ef-
fective and efficient operations resulted in wait 
times per vehicle averaging 10 minutes from 
check-in to vaccination, followed by a 15 to 
30-minute observation period. 
The administration of Denton County was 
instrumental in organizing this tremendous op-
eration. Judge Eads and the Denton County 
Commissioners are to be commended for their 
endorsement and oversight of the TMS clinic, 
as well as other vaccine distribution sites 
across the county. The diligence and devotion 
of both county officials and frontline workers 
has ensured the health and well-being of hun-
dreds of thousands of their constituents and 
neighbors. 
The vaccination effort was further bolstered 
by the philanthropic outpouring of time and ef-
forts from many volunteer organizations, in-
cluding Denton County’s Medical Reserve 
Corps. The members of the Denton County 
Medical Reserve Corps, in addition to per-
forming screenings, offering accessible infor-
mation services, and encouraging the vaccina-
tion effort, vaccinated over 10,000 individuals 
per day through their point of distribution at 
the Texas Motor Speedway. Over 125,000 
residents of the county have been directly vac-
cinated thus far by the Medical Corps, and 
their community awareness and involvement 
campaigns have resulted in even more individ-
uals receiving a COVID–19 vaccine. Due to its 
exemplary performance, the Denton County 
MRC was selected as an awardee for the 
MRC Program National Recognition Awardee 
for Community Response in COVID–19 Vac-
cination Efforts. 
In addition, in June the North Central Texas 
Council of Governments (NCTCOG) awarded 
the Denton County Mass Vaccination Co-
operation Site the 2021 Regional Cooperation 
Award. This award is presented to two or 
more local governments acting in tandem to 
address the concerns of the community. I join 
NCTCOG in extoling the monumental co-
operation that allowed the vaccination effort to 
reach across city and county lines. The 42-re-
gional partners that made this success pos-
sible are truly an estimable model of commu-
nity service and camaraderie. 
The Denton County Mass Vaccination Co-
operative has been invaluable to bolstering the 
public health and wellbeing of the citizens of 
the county, state, and nation. The North Texas 
community gratefully applauds the staff and 
volunteers for their whole-hearted service in 
the face of the COVID–19 pandemic, and their 
aid in bringing this crisis under control. 
It is my privilege to recognize the Denton 
County Mass Vaccination program and con-
gratulate the TMS clinic for receiving the 
NCTCOG Regional Cooperation Award, and 
the Denton County MRC for its national com-
mendation. I trust that Denton County’s con-
tinuing efforts will enhance the safety and se-
curity of our community. The frontline workers 
and volunteers that have shouldered the bur-
den of the vaccination distribution are truly a 
model of civic responsibility and courage, and 
I thank them for their outstanding efforts.

HONORING JOSEPH FRATTA 
HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Joseph Fratta, the New York 
State Trustee for District Ill and an Overseer 
to the Fr. Vincent Capodanno Lodge. Born in 
1948, Joseph was raised in Little Italy, where 
he worked at his family’s floral shop. In 1968, 
he was drafted to fight in Vietnam, where he 
was highly decorated. After one skirmish 
where he was hurt, he turned down his Purple 
Heart because he did not want to worry his 
mother about his injuries. While in Vietnam, 
Joseph sought to build an orphanage for the 
dozens of orphans in the village he was sta-
tioned in. With the help of others, Joseph was 
able to get the orphanage up and running, 
where he cared for twenty-five children. In 
1999, he joined the Order of the Sons of Italy, 
quickly rising up the ranks. Joseph is a dedi-
cated member of the Lodge, chairing the Arbi-
tration Committee and Cancer Research on 
the state level. Joseph now lives in Staten Is-
land where he is a caring husband, father, and 
grandfather.

JOHN HURLEY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Denver resident 
and Good Samaritan, Johnny Hurley, for his 
heroic actions in Arvada, Colo. on June 21, 
2021. 
On June 21, 2021, an Arvada Police Officer 
was ambushed and shot by a man who had 
immense hatred toward police. Minutes later, 
40-year-old Denver resident Hurley intervened 
and shot the suspect, undoubtedly saving 
countless other lives. A tragedy upon a trag-
edy, Hurley was then mistook as the suspect 
and shot by a member of the Arvada Police 
Department. 
Hearing gunshots, Hurley stepped up to pro-
tect and defend his community. According to 
Arvada’s Chief of Police, Johnny’s actions 
were ‘‘decisive, courageous and effective in 
stopping further loss of life.’’ Hurley’s friends 
and family remember him as ‘‘an idealist’’ and 
‘‘an iconoclast,’’ and were not surprised to 
learn Hurley stepped up to defend his commu-
nity in a time of need. The loss of Hurley is 
tragic, and I join the Arvada Police Depart-
ment and our community at large in honoring 
his bravery for his actions that day which un-
doubtedly saved lives. 
I want to extend my deepest and heartfelt 
condolences to Johnny Hurley’s family. We 
will remember Johnny Hurley for his heroic ac-
tions on June 21, 2021, and his sacrifice for 
our community.

OF 
THE 
LEMOORE VOLUNTEER FIRE DE-
PARTMENT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 100th anniversary of the 
Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department. The 
Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department is cele-
brating their 100th anniversary of service to 
the Central Valley community of Lemoore. 
Over the last one hundred years, this fire de-
partment has consisted of entirely community 
volunteers. The dedication, commitment, and 
service of these citizens have kept the com-
munity safe and informed. 
In service to the Lemoore community, fire 
department members contribute hundreds of 
volunteer hours in service, training, and com-
munity involvement. They participate in the an-
nual Lemoore Christmas Tree display, edu-
cational school presentations, and various 
community 
celebrations. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department has main-
tained their commitment to service throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic in risk of their own 
health and safety. 
The Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department 
members have worked hard to uphold the nu-
merous traditions and sense of camaraderie 
that set the department apart. These contin-
ued traditions work to promote unity and loy-
alty throughout the Lemoore community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department 
on their 100th anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE & SERVICE 
OF GEORGE EDWARD HAIRSTON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the life 
and service of Mr. George Edward Hairston. 
George E. Hairston was born and raised in 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, on February 11, 
1942. He passed away on March 8, 2021, at 
the age of seventy-nine. He was buried with 
military honors next to his beloved brother 
Richard Hairston. After graduating high school, 
George graduated from Morehouse College in 
Atlanta, GA, and went on to attend Columbia 
University in New York City, NY receiving his 
master’s degree in Social Work. 
George served in the United States military 
during the Vietnam War where he was as-
signed to a medical unit in Korea helping 
those who were wounded in combat. After his 
honorable discharge, George attended, and 
graduated, from New York University School 
of Law. While attending law school, he worked 
as a legal intern at the NAACP Legal Defense 
and Educational fund. Afterwards, Mr. Hairston 
was employed by the NAACP as an Assistant 
General Counsel. 
After leaving the NAACP, he entered private 
practice as a independent practitioner in New 
York City where he maintained a distinguished 
national civil rights litigation and criminal de-
fense practice. 
After living out and accomplishing his goal 
to be a renowned attorney fighting racial injus-
tice, Mr. Hairston went home to Chattanooga 
where be lived out the rest of his life until his 
demise. Due to his salient role and efforts in 
addressing racial injustice, Mr. Hairston ad-
dressed the 97th Congress at hearings held 
by the Subcommittee on the Judiciary of the 
United States House of Representative. His 
expertise helped Congress address racially 
motivated violence and systemic racism. 
Mr. Hairston labored decades to make our 
nation more inclusive and fought for those in 
need of justice. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to acknowl-
edge Mr. George E. Hairston for his honorable 
lifetime endeavors.

IN MEMORY OF SHARON SILZEL 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, my heart is heavy as I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend, Sharon Silzel, 
who passed away on December 17, 2020 
after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease. 
My prayers are with Sharon’s family as we 
mourn her passing. 
Sharon spent her first 30 years in Spokane, 
Washington as a dental and orthopedic assist-
ant before answering her true calling—politics. 
In 1994, she hopped on the campaign trail, 
helping to elect George Nethercutt to the very 
seat in Congress that I have the honor of rep-
resenting today. She was a force as a volun-
teer on my first campaign for Congress and 
remained a supporter and friend through the 
years. 
In every sense of the word, Sharon was a 
trailblazer. After marrying her soulmate Jack in 
2001, Sharon moved to Washington, D.C. 
where she served in the White House screen-
ing student correspondence for President 
George W. Bush. 
Upon returning to Eastern Washington, 
Sharon kept her passion for politics alive as a 
member of Ponderosa Republican Women 
where she continued to champion the values 
that make our nation the greatest in the world. 
Her love for politics never stopped Sharon 
from fully immersing herself in the Spokane 
County community. She was well-known by 
her neighbors as a faithful member of St. An-
thony Catholic Church and proud supporter of 
Trinity Elementary School. 
I knew Sharon to be a faithful follower of the 
Lord, and her light touched the lives of so 
many from Spokane to Washington, D.C. and 
everyone she met in between. Each and every 
one of us who had the privilege of knowing 
Sharon in this life are better because of it, and 
I thank God for giving me the blessing of call-
ing her my friend. 
Madam Speaker, Sharon Silzel lived an 
amazing life that deserves to be celebrated. In 
honor of her legacy, passion, and contribu-
tions that inspired so many, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Sharon 
Silzel. May God grant her eternal peace in His 
kingdom.

H.R. 3138 would establish a cybersecurity 
grant program in the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS). State and local govern-
ments would use the grants to address cyber-
security threats and risks to their informa-
tion systems. The bill also would establish a 
process for assessing grant applications, re-
viewing cybersecurity plans, and monitoring 
the performance of grant recipients. CBO es-
timates that implementing H.R. 3138 would 
cost about $1.1 billion over the 2021–2026 pe-
riod (detailed in Table 1). Such spending 
would be subject to the appropriations of the 
specified and estimated amounts. 
H.R. 3138 would authorize appropriations of 
$500 million annually over the 2022–2026 pe-
riod and such sums as may be necessary for 
subsequent years. Those amounts would be 
distributed as grants to state, local, and 
tribal 
governments. 
Using 
historical 
spendout rates for similar grant programs, 
CBO estimates that providing those grants 
would cost $1.1 billion over that period.

cations and cybersecurity plans, disbursing

by the bill would cost $17 million over the 
2021–2026 period. That estimate is based on a 
comparison with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s costs to manage the 
State and Local Preparedness Grant Pro-
gram. That agency spends approximately $25 
million (or 0.8 percent of total program fund-
ing) per year to manage $3 billion grants. 
Using that rate as a basis, CBO estimates 
that administering the cybersecurity grant 
program authorized under H.,R. 3138 would 
cost $4 million each year and total $17 mil-
lion over the 2021–2026, after accounting for 
the time to establish the program. 
The bill also would establish an inde-
pendent committee to provide recommenda-
tions and guidance on the operation of the 
grant program. Using information from DHS 
about the costs of similar committees, CBO 
estimates that staff salaries, travel expenses, 
and facilities would cost $1 million annually 
and total $5 million over the 2021–2026 period. 
For the estimate, CBO assumes that the 
bill will be enacted in fiscal year 2021. Under 
the assumption, DHS could incur some costs 
in 2021, but CBO expects that most of the 
costs would be incurred in 2022 and later.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF TROY 
DAVIS 
HON. BLAKE D. MOORE 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Police Corporal 
Troy C. Davis, a true servant of the commu-
nity who passed away suddenly and tragically 
on July 12, 2021. 
Born August 15, 1970, Troy lived a life de-
fined by service to his community and his fam-
ily. Corporal Davis served for over two dec-
ades as a member of the Vernal City Police 
Department with the utmost care. Through his 
actions, he demonstrated that our law enforce-
ment truly cares for members of our commu-
nities. 
Corporal Davis took on a unique role by 
serving the younger generation. The Vernal 
City Police Department partnered with the 
Uintah School District to establish a School 
Resource Officer position to keep local 
schools safe. As the School Resource Officer 
at both Vernal Middle School and Uintah Mid-
dle School, Corporal Davis’s work ensured 
that the students of Vernal had a safe learning 
environment. All who knew Corporal Davis 
knew of his genuine care for the students he 
protected and served. His passing leaves a 
tremendous void in the community. 
On July 16 and 17, Vernal came together to 
honor the life and service of Corporal Davis. 
With his police vehicle parked at the Uintah 
Conference Center for tribute, members of the 
community left signs, notes, cards, and flow-
ers to honor his life and his decades of serv-
ice. His funeral was held on Saturday, and it 
provided all those who knew him an oppor-
tunity to celebrate his life of selfless service. 
Corporal Davis was a lifelong member of 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. In addition to his service as a member 
of the Vernal City Police Department, Corporal 
Davis served an LDS mission in Sydney, Aus-
tralia. He was defined by his faithful service to 
his church and community. 
Corporal Davis is survived by his wife, 
Mariel (Goodrich) Davis; his children, Hayden 
Troy (Erin) Davis, Aliya Madeline Rich, 
Breanna Marie (Caden) Nerdin, Ashlen Layne 
Davis, Randon Bryan Davis, and Taegan Troy 
Davis; and his grandchildren, Kayson Troy 
Davis and Noah Scott Davis. I join the Davis 
family and the entire community in mourning 
his loss.

CONGRATULATING SEYMOUR VOL-
UNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT ON 
FIFTY YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the Seymour Volunteer Fire 
Department in Sevier County in the First Con-
gressional District in Tennessee which re-
cently celebrated fifty years of protecting and 
serving their community. Fire protection in our 
great Nation began as an all-volunteer service 
and in Seymour that rich tradition of volunteer 
service continues today. 
In 1971, Seymour was a small community 
comprised of family farms and some small 
businesses. The owners of those businesses 
made the wise decision to establish fire pro-
tection for their homes and businesses as 
there was no such service in the thirty mile 
stretch between Knoxville and Sevierville. And 
thus, with the purchase of a new Boardman 
Class A fire engine, the Seymour Volunteer 
Fire Department was born. In that first year, 
twelve firefighters responded to 24 calls for 
service and their engine was stored outside in 
a vacant lot at the corner of Chapman High-
way and Old Sevierville Pike. 
Over the last fifty years, as the community 
of Seymour has grown and gone from zero 
stoplights to eight and those family farms have 
developed into subdivisions, the Seymour Vol-
unteer Fire Department has also grown to 
serve over 40,000 people, 400 businesses, 70 
churches, 2 private schools, 8 public schools 
and Johnson University. The Fire District is 
spread across three Tennessee counties: 
Blount, Knox, and Sevier, covering a response 
area of almost 120 square miles. The Depart-
ment now has six stations, 26 pieces of equip-
ment and over 60 volunteers that continue to 
answer the call of duty. With all these 
changes, the original fire truck remains and 
serves as a reminder of the many volunteers 
who have responded to the call of duty over 
these last five decades. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the Seymour Volun-
teer Fire Department on fifty years of service. 
I am proud to represent these volunteers and 
the communities they serve.

RECOGNIZING 
DAYANARA 
RAMI-
REZ FOR HER PUBLIC SERVICE 
IN CONGRESS 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a member of my staff, Dayanara Ra-
mirez, who dutifully served for three years in 
my 
office 
as 
Communications 
Director. 
Dayanara is leaving Congress—for now—to 
join the Biden Administration after an incred-
ibly successful 5-year tenure in the House of 
Representatives. 
Dayanara first joined Team Takano in July 
2018 and quickly became integral to my of-
fice’s role as a progressive voice in Congress. 
Her tenure could be defined by her ferocious 
defense of equality and progressive values, 
and her energy helped foster a creative and 
industrious 
environment 
on 
her 
team. 
Dayanara worked diligently to expand our 
communications team and grow our social 
media footprint across every major platform 
into what it is today. 
In addition to her official duties in Congress, 
Dayanara made it a point to contribute to the

institution and its people through her generous 
volunteerism. Dayanara served as a member 
of the Congressional Hispanic Staff Associa-
tion and the Democratic Digital Communica-
tions Staff Association, and most recently as 
the President of the LGBT Congressional Staff 
Association. 
Dayanara has been a loyal member of my 
staff who has not only helped me to stay 
‘‘woke,’’ but also helped me to improve my 
own Spanish speaking skills in the service of 
my constituents of CA–41. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a privilege to 
have such a dedicated public servant as 
Dayanara on my staff. I have every confidence 
that Dayanara will continue to excel in her fu-
ture endeavors and fully expect her to eventu-
ally return to Congress with even more experi-
ence to defend progressive values across our 
country.
