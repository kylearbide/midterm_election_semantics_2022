Loving and gracious God, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
We ask today that You bless the 
Members of the people’s House to be 
the best and most faithful servants of 
the people they serve. As this Second 
Session of the 116th Congress draws

spirit of wisdom and truth from this 
assembly. 
They return to the Capitol with a 
huge weight lifted from their shoul-
ders, for which a nation is grateful.

lied upon in the past. 
Continue to bless and protect those 
across our Nation who work each day 
to minister to the health needs of those 
who suffer from COVID. 
May all that is done this day in the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today at 
a moment of extreme hardship for fam-
ilies across the country. Last week, 
both the House and the Senate passed 
bipartisan legislation that would pro-
vide relief for people who are strug-
gling to make ends meet. That package 
includes a wide variety of provisions 
that will allow Americans who are at 
the end of their ropes to stay in their 
homes and to put food on the table. 
Despite the fact that the Trump ad-
ministration was part of the negotia-
tions for the legislation and approved 
of all the measures that it contained, 
the President unexpectedly decided to 
delay signing the package into law for 
several days. This stalling was an act 
of theater that cost the American peo-
ple millions of dollars in terms of pan-
demic-related 
unemployment 
assist-
ance that they desperately need. 
Fortunately, last night, the Presi-
dent finally signed the bill. At last, 
workers and families can exhale a bit, 
knowing that aid is on the way. 
The primary reason that the Presi-
dent provided for holding up his signa-
ture was the enactment of this impor-
tant legislation that we are about to 
undertake in the next 40 minutes. 
Democrats agree that families de-
serve more, and that is why I intro-
duced the CASH Act on Christmas Eve 
to increase the payments in the relief 
package to $2,000, the exact amount the 
President said he wants. 
Madam Speaker, I introduced this 
legislation on Christmas Eve with the 
following 
parable 
in 
mind. 
Jacob 
Marley 
forewarned 
that 
the 
three 
ghosts would visit Ebenezer Scrooge to 
warn him about the path to redemp-
tion. He started with Christmas Past, 
and we might start here with Christ-
mas past, acknowledging that, 3 years 
ago, one of the largest tax cuts in 
American history that overwhelmingly 
came to people at the very top, includ-
ing a top individual rate cut of 39 per-
cent to 37.5 percent and a corporate 
rate cut from 36 percent to 21 percent, 
were part of that endeavor. 
In the Christmas present, there are 20 
million Americans who are receiving 
unemployment insurance, more than 
350,000 dead, and 19 million people in-
fected with this pandemic. 
For 
Christmas 
Future, 
Marley 
warned Ebenezer Scrooge that there 
was a way for redemption, and that was 
through a new generosity and a new 
kindness. We could emulate that here 
this afternoon by raising that impact 
payment from $600 to $2,000. The mir-
acle of this season would remain the 
triumph of light for those who des-
perately need our assistance. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
we 
could 
have 
passed this bill 4 days ago, but our col-
leagues on the other side went against 
the 
President’s 
wishes, 
and 
they 
blocked it. So, here we are today, back 
again to try to get a bigger check for 
the American people. I sincerely hope 
that the House Republicans have had a 
change of heart and will join us in 
passing the CASH Act. 
Madam Speaker, let’s pass this bill 
and do what is right for our neighbors 
back home as they simply try to sur-
vive each day. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, last fall, Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI and Washington Demo-
crats refused to accept a bipartisan 
COVID relief bill, insisting instead on 
more than $3 trillion of absurd policies, 
from marijuana banking to early re-
lease of criminals. Months ago, they 
even rejected a nearly $2 trillion 
COVID relief proposal by President 
Trump. Many Americans knew right 
then that leading Democrats were sab-
otaging the economy ahead of the elec-
tion for political gain. 
During those crucial months, while 
Speaker PELOSI stalled COVID relief, 
thousands of Americans died, tens of 
thousands of small businesses closed, 
and hospitals and nursing homes strug-
gled, while millions of Americans were 
left jobless. 
In the election, Democrats and Con-
gress paid a steep price for this cruel 
inaction, with voters giving House Re-
publicans nearly two-thirds of the 
seats needed to take back the major-
ity. 
I thank President Trump for signing 
bipartisan legislation, even with its 
flaws, that included several separate 
bills that hitched a ride on the annual 
funding bill for the government, in-
cluding COVID relief, a first-ever ban 
on surprise medical bills, and $328 bil-
lion in urgent tax relief for families 
and local businesses. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize that to-
day’s CASH Act will pass with bipar-
tisan support, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, and I respect the decision 
of each Member of Congress. But for 
me, I worry that this whopping $463 bil-
lion won’t do what is needed: stimulate 
the economy or get the jobless back to 
work. 
At this point in the recovery, the 
fact is, it is hard to stimulate a Main 
Street that is locked down by local 
politicians. 
This won’t help local restaurants get 
their workers permanently back or 
hospitality and convention industries 
rehire their workers for the long term, 
and it won’t help get energy workers 
back on the job. 
Will this stimulate our local econo-
mies? Not a lot. 
What we know is that much of this 
extra $1,600 will go to pay down credit 
card debt or savings or even make new 
purchases online at Walmart, Best 
Buy, or Amazon. 
So, 
rather 
than 
merely 
sending 
checks to credit card companies, this 
half-trillion dollars could more than 
double the number of small businesses 
and midsize businesses getting PPP 
forgivable loans to hire their workers 
and stay alive through the recovery. It 
could make sure airline workers have 
secure jobs for more than just a few 
months and do more to replenish front-
line healthcare workers. 
Madam Speaker, we should be fo-
cused on the families that are hurting 
most, none more than the 8 million 
Americans who lost their jobs due to 
COVID. Our top priority, in addition to 
defeating the virus, is to get them back 
to work. So far, Congress has already 
approved more than $20,800 directly to 
a family of four with one parent out of

work. That is on top of their State un-
employment benefits. 
Madam Speaker, if we want to do 
even more for the jobless, this same 
huge amount of money today could 
give every unemployed worker from 
COVID and their employer a $50,000 in-
centive to return to work. With this 
huge amount of money, you could even 
give the bottom 90 percent of workers 
in America an income-tax-free year for 
2021, a full year where you go to work 
each day for yourself rather than for 
Washington. 
Can you imagine what a no-tax 2021 
would do for low-and middle-income 
families, workers, and the local econ-
omy? 
Or we can simply hold this money 
back, not hastily spend another half- 
trillion dollars we don’t have, while we 
assess the impact vaccinations are hav-
ing on consumer confidence and the 
unlocking of the economy. 
Madam Speaker, there are a lot of 
ways to spend money, if that is the 
goal. But in my view, let’s be smart 
about it. Let’s target assistance to 
those who need it most. The Com-
mittee on Ways and Means should be 
the place to explore and analyze these 
options, not just have a bill that 
spends over $400 billion hastily dropped 
on us at the last minute. 
I know, working together, Repub-
licans and Democrats, we can do better 
to help people get back to work and 
truly help this recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
on this and for recognizing me. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in strong 
support of this legislation. The Amer-
ican people are struggling. We hear 
from them every single day, and they 
need this additional relief now. The re-
cent coronavirus relief bill passed by 
Congress obviously is long overdue. 
The House wanted to pass relief last 
May, but Republicans refused. Then, 
the pandemic has only gotten worse, 
and the pain has been worse for so 
many families and small businesses. 
While the relief bill does supply 
short-term relief, it was regrettable to 
see President Trump delay signing this 
legislation. That decision, that delay, 
had consequences. It hurt families with 
greater uncertainty and, in some cases, 
caused people to lapse their benefits. 
I did support the legislation that in-
cluded the $600 stimulus checks be-
cause that was all we could get the 
other side to agree to. But it is obvi-
ously not enough. That is why I sup-
port this legislation, $2,000 in direct 
payments for Americans who are strug-
gling. 
I, along with my Democratic col-
leagues, have pushed for these higher 
payments for some time, and now, 
President Trump agrees. The leader of 
the Republican Party stands in support 
of this effort. 
These $2,000 payments, every Member 
of Congress should support them. This 
would make a difference in the lives of 
Americans who are facing the greatest 
uncertainty that they have experi-
enced, for many of them, in their life-
times, putting money in their hands, 
allowing them to pay their bills, which 
will help them support those small 
businesses. 
Probably 
more 
impor-
tantly, it can give them some of the fi-
nancial support they need in order to 
make the decisions that they have to 
make to protect their families. 
President Trump changed his mind 
and supports this legislation. That is 
why we acted. We would have included 
much larger payments in the legisla-
tion had he spoken up sooner, but it is 
never too late to do the right thing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman. 
This is a moment we can all come to-
gether, Democrats and Republicans, in-
cluding the President of the United 
States, and do something big and bold 
that would help American families get 
through this most difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the 
chairman for his work in moving 
quickly and putting this legislation to-
gether. I commend those on the other 
side who will stand with us today and 
support this. 
It is my hope that this legislation 
will quickly go over to the Senate. 
They will get the message and send 
this legislation on to the President, 
wherever he may be. He will sign the 
bill, and we can get this help to the 
American people. 
b 1615 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. SCHRADER). 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak against the CASH 
Act. This is an ineffective and poorly 
targeted approach to aiding Americans 
in distress. It is clearly a last-minute 
political maneuver by the President 
and extremists on both sides of the po-
litical spectrum who have been largely 
absent during months of very hard ne-
gotiations. They have chosen to tweet 
their opinions instead of coming to the 
table to get aid in the hands of Ameri-
cans and small businesses who need it 
most. 
Over the last 6 months, and espe-
cially in the last few weeks as the holi-
days loomed and COVID cases sky-
rocketed, the Problem Solvers Caucus 
worked with Senators on both sides of 
the aisle and House and Senate leader-
ship to craft legislation that includes 
vetted programs like the PPP and un-
employment compensation that have 
been improved upon since the start of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I feel for all of those who are suf-
fering today due to financial hardship 
and look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues on a bipartisan, bi-
cameral basis to continue to find ways 
to help provide relief. 
People who are making six-figure in-
comes who have not been impacted by 
COVID–19 do not need checks. We have 
had 9 months to fix this program to get 
aid to the people who need it most. 
That has not happened. Let’s reverse 
course and target those in need. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SUOZZI), who did a great job 
on the surprise billing legislation that 
passed in the COVID Act. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Mr. Chairman for his leadership 
on the CASH Act and also, as he men-
tioned, on the Ban Surprise Billing 
Act. It is really amazing the relief we 
are going to be giving to consumers 
this year on a bipartisan basis with his 
leadership. We are going to be making 
people’s lives a lot better. So I thank 
him so much for the work he has done 
on both the CASH Act and on the work 
to address surprise billing. 
Madam Speaker, the effects of this 
pandemic have been cruelly uneven. 
Some remain unscathed, working re-
motely and still healthy, while mil-
lions of others are awash in misery, un-
able to return to work or pay their 
bills, even funeral bills for lost loved 
ones. 
While the stock market has hit a new 
record today, there are still bodies 
stored in refrigerator trucks. While on-
line retail and grocery stores are boom-
ing, airline, Broadway, and mom-and- 
pop store employees have been laid off, 
and life savings invested in small busi-
nesses have been wiped out. 
The 
President’s 
cynical 
ploy 
to 
threaten the COVID relief package to 
obscure his dark-of-night pardons has 
now resulted in a fighter’s chance that 
we can pass this $2,000 stimulus check 
legislation if we can only get MITCH 
MCCONNELL to finally show some empa-
thy. 
Let’s pass this bill, and then let’s im-
mediately work to send the billions 
necessary to save our State and local 
governments before they fire police of-
ficers, teachers, and frontline workers, 
which will only result in more unem-
ployment checks from us and financial 
ruin for those families and the commu-
nities they serve. 
Let’s rebuild our infrastructure and 
put Americans back to work. Let’s 
build back better. We can do this if we 
remember why we are here and we, 
both Democrats and Republicans, rec-
ognize that outside of this Beltway 
fantasyland, millions of Americans are 
desperately pleading for our help. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
I look around the room here, it looks 
like I am in the U.S. Congress. I mean, 
I see the American flag there; George 
Washington is over there; it says ‘‘In 
God We Trust.’’ But looking at this bill

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9156 
December 28, 2020 
today, it makes me feel like we are in 
the Parliament of Afghanistan, Bu-
rundi, Yemen, or Bolivia. 
Do we really think the way to im-
prove the quality of life for Americans 
is to just print more money from the 
Fed? If you look around, we are going 
to be printing another $400 billion. 
Has anybody looked lately at what is 
going on with the monetary supply? M1 
up 50 percent; M2 up 20 percent. 
Don’t people realize that just print-
ing more is not a way to make our citi-
zens wealthier; it is just a way to 
debase the currency? 
The way for a wealthy country is to 
work 
hard 
through 
frugality 
and 
through improving one’s skills, not by 
having the Fed print money. 
Last time, when we sent out $1,200 
checks, I stopped by my local Walmart, 
and the people in charge of the elec-
tronics section said they had never 
seen such sales in their life. 
Is that really going to improve the 
lot of Americans, to go over and buy 
some more electronic junk from China? 
Apparently so. 
And let’s not forget when we look at 
inflation. We have inflation right now. 
Twice, in the recent past, we have 
changed the definition on what infla-
tion is. 
So we do have inflation; it is just 
that we keep changing the definition to 
mask it. That is why the market is up. 
The market is up because we really do 
have inflation. 
We are in the U.S. Congress. We 
should not think the way to prosperity 
is just printing money. We should act 
like we are the United States. That is 
why, for my whole life, other countries 
like to invest in the dollar. They re-
spect the value of the dollar more than 
the national currencies of Burundi, Af-
ghanistan, Yemen, and Bolivia. Those 
are four poor countries; that is why I 
picked them out. 
So I encourage Senator MCCONNELL 
to hold the line here, to act respon-
sibly. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, might I 
remind the gentleman that this is not 
about creating a path to prosperity. 
This is about creating a path to liquid-
ity, which subsequently creates a path 
to demand for people at the lower end 
of the economic spectrum, 20 million of 
whom are not working at the moment 
through no fault of their own. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER), 
an excellent member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the CASH Act, which will 
send $2,000 checks to the American peo-
ple. 
I want to thank Chairman NEAL for 
coming together very quickly to create 
this act in a thoughtful way. 
The American people are hurting this 
holiday season, and they need our help. 
Our bill would increase those payments 
to $2,000, which would also include 
adult dependents and students. 
We realize that $600 is not enough for 
people facing eviction and hunger. For 
many, this will just pay a past-due 
rental bill for July. 
It is good and important that we are 
sending support to small businesses, 
strong unemployment aid, nutrition 
and rental assistance, but this relief is 
coming 7 months later than it should 
have. It is vital that Congress not 
penny-pinch the American people now. 
This CASH bill is bipartisan, and if 
Senator MITCH MCCONNELL would put 
it on the Senate floor, it would be bi-
cameral. 
Let me push back, too, that this is 
too much. 
We have 40 million Americans who 
work full-time and made less than 
$18,000 last year. With the minimum 
wage at $7.25, there isn’t a single two- 
bedroom apartment you can rent in a 
county in America for that money. 
There are tens of millions without 
healthcare. 
My family sells new cars and used 
cars. I have watched the debt burden of 
so many people just rise and rise and 
rise over the years. 
Is there a better way? You know, my 
Republican friends hate it when so- 
called Big Government decides what we 
need. The best way to let people man-
age their family is to put the money in 
their hands, give them that American 
freedom. 
Somehow, we can print money to do 
a $4 trillion tax cut over 20 years, but 
we can’t print enough money to help 
the American people. 
This is a good bill. I salute Chairman 
RICHARD NEAL, and I hope every Demo-
crat and every Republican will vote for 
it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
let’s get this straight. The small shop-
keeper who has lost their entire sav-
ings because of the lockdowns will get 
the same $2,000 grant as the govern-
ment bureaucrat who has been enjoy-
ing a steady paycheck at home for the 
past 10 months. 
This money is wholly inadequate for 
those who have been harmed by the 
lockdowns and wholly unnecessary for 
those who have not. 
This free money doesn’t come from 
Heaven. It comes from the future earn-
ings of those who will be struggling to 
get back on their feet, making the 
post-lockdown recovery more difficult 
and prolonged. 
Much of the burden of this debt will 
fall on the young, who have already 
borne the brunt of these lockdowns. It 
is, in a real sense, a massive wealth 
transfer from the future to the present, 
from the young to the old, and from 
those who have been hurt by the 
lockdowns to those who have not. 
There is only one way to end the suf-
fering caused by these lockdowns, and 
that is to end them. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman and the chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee for 
his distinguished leadership. 
I thank our Speaker for her per-
sistent leadership. 
I thank all of the Democratic Mem-
bers and Republican Members who un-
derstand what this legislation is. 
It is a survival cash payment for 
Americans making under a certain 
amount, which means they are on the 
survival pathway. 
Maybe they haven’t spoken to the 
constituents of, I believe, probably 90 
percent of the Members of this Con-
gress who have said they are on the 
edge and they are about to go over. 
They can’t pay their rent or buy food. 
They are in food distribution lines. Be-
fore I came here Sunday, I was at a 
church, and we were giving out food. 
I asked during the spring for $3,000. I 
was willing to go for $600 so that des-
perate Americans could get enough to 
survive. 
Mr. Speaker, I am supporting this. I 
ask my friends and colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to recognize that, 
when you are privileged to stand in a 
place like this where the constitutional 
Fathers gave us the opportunity to 
lead this government, stand for the 
American people. 
I support the CASH Act because it is 
survival for Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong 
support of the CASH Act, a bill to provide 
$2,000 in direct payments to individuals. 
It was welcomed news that the President 
signed the COVID–19 relief bill that also in-
cludes the Omnibus Appropriations for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2021. 
This bill: 
Accelerates vaccine distribution and crushes 
the coronavirus; 
Provides rent, food, unemployment, and di-
rect payment to put money in the Pockets of 
the American People through: direct payments 
worth up to $600 per adult or child; 
Averts the sudden expiration of Unemploy-
ment Insurance benefits for millions and 
added a $300 per week UI enhancement for 
Americans out of work; 
Delivers key tax benefits for Struggling Fam-
ilies—through changes to the Earned Income 
Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit that help 
ensure that families who faced unemployment 
or reduced wages during the pandemic are 
able to receive a strong tax credit based on 
their 2019 income; 
Provides strong support for Small Busi-
nesses by providing: $284 billion for first and 
second forgivable PPP loans, $15 billion in 
dedicated funding for live venues, independent 
movie theaters, and cultural institutions, and 
$20 billion for targeted EIDL Grants which are 
critical to many smaller businesses on Main 
Street; 
Funds Education, Child Care & Students by 
providing: $82 billion in funding for colleges 
and schools, and $10 billion for childcare as-
sistance to help get parents back to work and 
keep childcare providers open; 
Provides Pell Grant expansion to reach 
500,000 new recipients, ensuring more than 
1.5 million students will now receive the max-
imum benefit; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9157 
December 28, 2020 
Supports the Global Fight Against COVID— 
with an additional $3.36 billion for a total of $4 
billion for GAVI, the international vaccine alli-
ance, recognizing that we are not truly safe 
until the whole world is safe from the 
coronavirus. 
I will vote for the CASH Act because it in-
creases direct payments to individuals from a 
$600 direct payment to $2000, which will help 
families struggling with the economic impacts 
of COVID–19. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) reported that as of December 
23, 2020, that 18,170,062 cases of COVID–19 
resulting in 321,734 deaths had been reported 
in the United States. 
The new year will mark a terrible milestone 
for the United States—the last time we saw 
death like this in our nation was during the 
1918 Flu Pandemic, which recorded a total of 
675,000 deaths in the United States. 
What the costs will be to our nation for the 
over three-hundred thousand deaths have yet 
to be fully calculated. 
It is a tragedy that too many households 
who have lost a member to COVID–19 are 
struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also 
the friends, co-workers, business owners, pro-
fessionals, students, teachers, wives, hus-
bands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and 
grandparents who also are feeling these 
losses because someone that mattered to 
them is no longer here. 
Each of these lives could have had dozens 
of connections with other people who were not 
able to be with them during their final mo-
ments on this earth who are lost to us be-
cause we too often only consider the imme-
diate household. 
My deepest concerns are for the medical 
professionals who are seeing more death than 
soldiers who have fought on battlefields in de-
fense of our nation since World War II. 
Death every day for medical professionals 
who pride themselves on robbing death by 
keeping the very ill or critically injured alive 
are themselves wounded by each loss in ways 
that we cannot understand. 
Too many of our medical professionals are 
losing that battle with death as they attempt to 
treat extremely ill COVID–19 patients because 
they do not have access to: sufficient amounts 
of essential therapies, or the special trained 
staff to administer interventions that could 
save lives. 
Medical people also have not had the uni-
versal support of political leaders who are will-
ing to promote wearing of face coverings, so-
cial distancing, and handwashing to limit the 
spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV–2) the infection that 
causes COVID–19. 
There is a hidden cost to the fool-hearty dis-
regard for the seriousness of this moment in 
American history. 
My concerns are for the economic impact 
and the long-term damage to our nation’s 
health care delivery system. 
Today we will focus on the economic inju-
ries caused by COVID–19, and I look forward 
to working with my colleagues on addressing 
the systemic long-term issues caused by un-
equal access to the health care. 
Small businesses and working men and 
women of this great nation are the life blood 
of the economy, and who pay the lion share 
of federal taxes, now find themselves, through 
no fault of their own, in need of assistance in 
the form of direct payments that will provide a 
bridge to them and to the economy for the 
next few weeks so that the next Administration 
will have time to assess and craft the relief 
package needed to get the nation over the last 
hurdles of the pandemic’s economic impact. 
Since the 1980s, corporate income tax reve-
nues have become a smaller share of overall 
tax revenues paid to the federal government. 
In 2017, President Trump signed into law 
P.L. 115–97, which substantially and perma-
nently changed the U.S. federal tax system for 
the wealthy and large corporations. 
Most of the changes to the individual in-
come tax system in P.L. 115–97 for those less 
well off are temporary and scheduled to expire 
at the end of 2025, after which the rates for 
these individuals will return to what it was for 
2017. 
In contrast, many of the tax cuts made in 
P.L. 
115–97 
affecting 
corporations 
and 
wealthy individuals are permanent, in other 
words they will keep the drastic cut in cor-
porate taxes. 
The facts are that working individuals and 
small businesses support the U.S. govern-
ment’s federal tax system. 
The largest source of revenue to the federal 
government is the individual income tax, which 
in 2019, generated $1.7 trillion. 
The second-largest source of federal rev-
enue is payroll taxes, which is collected by 
employers and is often paid quarterly. 
In FY2019, payroll taxes generated $1.2 tril-
lion in federal revenue or thirty-six percent of 
the total revenue for the federal government. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 
projects that federal income tax revenues in 
FY2020 will be $1.5 trillion, and payroll tax 
revenue will be $1.3 trillion. 
In FY2020, it is projected that about 47 per-
cent of federal revenue will be generated 
through the individual income tax. 
In FY2019, corporate tax receipts were only 
$230 billion, or nearly 7 percent of federal rev-
enue, and in FY2020, corporate tax receipts 
are expected to be $151 billion, less than 5 
percent of federal revenue. 
Receipts from other sources are also pro-
jected to increase in FY2020 to $298 billion, 
from $271 billion in FY2019, which will result 
in 9 percent of total revenue up from 8 percent 
the previous year. 
Obligated social insurance federal program 
payments for Social Security and Medicare 
are paid through payroll taxes and are ex-
pected to generate an additional estimated 
$1.3 trillion, or 35 percent of revenue in 
FY2020. 
The $2,000 in payments to individuals will 
be used to pay bills, rent, utilities, car notes, 
or purchase needed items like winter coats, 
and other essentials, which will translate into 
income for small businesses. 
All of this spending will generate local, state, 
and federal tax revenue as it fuels consump-
tion and the provision of services that are still 
available through the economy. 
Overtime basic Keynesian economics has 
proven itself to be a reliable economic model 
and has repeatedly proven that money turning 
over in the economy makes more money. 
There is a reason why it is important to 
stimulate the economy during a deadly un-
checked pandemic, the chief of which is its 
depression of the national and global econo-
mies resulting in a downturn creating reces-
sion conditions. 
We know the end of the COVID–19 
pandemic’s vice on the economy is insight 
with the delivery of a vaccine, but we are not 
there yet—we must help the American people, 
and most importantly our small businesses, 
endure until we reach seventy percent herd 
immunity. 
The use of direct payments is the Keynes-
ian solution that is winning the day across the 
globe for countries able to support their 
economies in this way. 
Payments to individuals allow them and not 
the government to make spending decisions 
on their household’s essential life-sustaining 
needs such as paying for housing, utility bills, 
food, and clothing which allows money they 
spend to circulate through the economy like 
blood throughout the body. 
People in this nation can and should be 
trusted to make decisions regarding how they 
spend the funds provided by the stimulus be-
cause they know their needs. 
Consumers will spend money with small 
businesses who should have the freedom to 
pay their workers and suppliers, workers and 
suppliers will be free to buy goods from other 
businesses, and those businesses will pay 
their workers and suppliers, and so on. 
In this way, the $2,000 in spending by each 
individual is actually spent more than once as 
the effect of each dollar spent creates more 
spending. 
This is called the expenditure multiplier ef-
fect: an initial increase in spending, cycles re-
peatedly through the economy, and has a 
larger impact than the initial $2,000 amount 
spent. 
The economy needs to be inoculated 
against recession, which is what the $2,000 in 
individual payments will do, and it will need a 
booster in about thirty to sixty days. 
If the overwhelming majority of those who 
will receive the $2,000 were planning to put it 
in a bank account and not spend it, then this 
bill would not be needed because the basic 
needs of the people would be satisfied, but we 
know this is not the case. 
No one is benefiting from the COVID–19 
economy. 
The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a his-
toric rate over the past five months, with 7.8 
million Americans falling into poverty after the 
expanded $600 a week in unemployment as-
sistance expired at the end of July. 
This represents the greatest increase since 
the government began tracking poverty sixty 
years ago. 
In the city of Houston, nine key service sec-
tors accounted for seventy percent of all jobs 
lost which totaled 1,343,600. 
Houston workers lost jobs in the following 
areas: 
Healthcare 391,000; retail 303,600; food 
service 267,000; finance 166,000; private edu-
cation 63,400; arts and entertainment 37,400; 
accommodations 28,700; air transportation 
20,200; and other services 115,800. 
In addition to these positions, jobs were also 
lost in other areas, the largest of which was 
construction which shut down 30,700 jobs; 
professional and business services followed, 
with 25,300 jobs lost, although 13,900 were in 
temporary and provisional jobs in employment 
services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in March/ 
April; and non-oil manufacturing lost 7,700 
jobs. 
Americans out of work due to COVID–19 
have generated 86 million jobless claims, with

new claims being filed in recent weeks topping 
800,000. 
Millions of Americans who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic have fallen thousands of 
dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear 
warning sign that people are running out of 
money for basic needs. 
If this is not enough evidence of what is 
happening, look at the miles of vehicles lined 
up outside of food distribution centers for as-
sistance; we have all seen this occurring in 
each of our states. 
Moody’s Analytics warned in November 
2020 that 9 million renters said they were be-
hind on rent, according to a Census Bureau 
survey. 
The Bureau of the Census reports that 
twenty-one percent of all renters are behind 
on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent of 
Black families and seventeen percent of His-
panic households are behind on theirs. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s 
analysis of persons who were employed prior 
to the pandemic reports that 1.3 million of 
these households are now an average of 
$5,400 in debt on rent and utilities, after those 
people had lost jobs and their family’s income 
dropped. 
The new COVID–19 stimulus bill, already 
agreed to by both the House and Senate and 
signed by President Trump, restores unem-
ployment assistance, but cuts that assistance 
from $600 a week to $300 a week without 
consideration for the facts on the ground for 
the millions of Americans who remain out of 
work due to COVID–19 public health policy, 
and have been without sufficient income since 
August 1, 2020. 
In fact, the decision about a $600 a week in 
addition to unemployment benefits is a good 
idea for those in labor markets with high costs 
of living like New York and Washington, D.C., 
but may have far outstripped the going rate for 
labor and the actual cost of living where the 
spending power of $600 exceeded market 
costs for living expenses. 
The Congress may need to revisit models 
for future programs of this type and provide a 
formula that is based on the actual spending 
power of funds provided so the ability of meet-
ing the cost-of-living needs can be more in 
line with the intent of the funds provided. 
This may mean that, depending on where 
someone lived at the time a disaster of this 
nature was declared, the amount they would 
qualify for receiving may be different depend-
ing on the spending power of a dollar where 
they live. 
Today, we have twenty million Americans 
who are receiving some kind of unemployment 
aid, and about 12 million of the unemployed 
stopped receiving their benefits. 
The nation is on the cusp of a recession 
that is in danger of becoming a double-dip 
event that would plummet the economy into a 
precarious economic state that will take much 
more than a $2,000 payment to each indi-
vidual to overcome. 
For all these reasons, I urge all Members to 
join me in voting for the CASH Act to increase 
individual payments from $600 to $2,000. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would point out to my 
colleague that nothing in this bill 
helps anyone get back to work: not a 
dime to the 8 million people who are 
left unemployed because of COVID, not 
a dime to help our small and medium- 
sized businesses, not a dime for Main 
Street. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, at 
some point on the infinite continuum 
that we call time, we will all have to 
account for our time. 
We are all going to have to answer 
the question: Where were you when a 
pandemic was gripping the land? What 
did you do when you had the oppor-
tunity to put money in the pockets of 
people who needed it? Where was your 
courage when you had the chance to 
cast a vote to make a difference in the 
lives of people? 
I say to you, my dear friends, this is 
the time for us to take a stand for the 
American people. Let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ to 
put money in their pockets, because we 
caused them to stay home as a result 
of the pandemic. The government is for 
this reason. This is why the govern-
ment exists: to take care of people. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let me remind the 
Members of this Chamber why we are 
here today. 
The CARES Act passed this House 
with, I think, five dissenters in the en-
tire Chamber. That was months and 
months ago. People exhausted the 
$1,200 that we allocated, based upon our 
tax system. And even the difficulty we 
had in trying to find adequate identi-
fication for those in America, as joint 
filers, making under $24,000 a year, sin-
gle filers making under $12,000 a year. 
Who can live on $12,000 a year? That 
is $1,000 a month. 
People have exhausted that benefit. 
They have tried earnestly and seri-
ously to overcome these obstacles that 
were created for them, not because of 
anything they did. We are not here be-
cause of malfeasance, speculation that 
derailed Wall Street in 2008, or corrup-
tion. We are here because of an inter-
national pandemic, and members of the 
American family at the lower end of 
the economic spectrum are hurting. 
When we sought advice on putting to-
gether the CARES Act, the Speaker 
and myself, in particular, in those very 
earnest days with Secretary Mnuchin, 
sought the advice of the best econo-
mists—former 
Treasury 
Secretaries, 
members of the Federal Reserve Board, 
people who do this every single day— 
and they all said you need to act with 
speed and determination, speed to get 
that money into the hands of the peo-
ple who will actually spend it. 
And that is precisely what we did. We 
got it to people at the lower end of the 
economic spectrum. 
b 1630 
As we proceed now to the new year, 
these people need another infusion of 
cash. I am going to go back to this 
point that I think is something that we 
need to remember. Three years ago, 
this House, over the objection of my-
self and many others, passed a tax cut 
that clearly benefited the people at the 
very top of the economic spectrum, the 
top 1 percent, in particular—dividends, 
buybacks, a top cut in the corporate 
rate from 36 percent to 21 percent, and 
the top rate on the individual side from 
39 percent to 37 percent. 
And we can’t find it in our hearts in 
this holiday season, again, based upon 
the Charles Dickens’ parable of ‘‘A 
Christmas Carol,’’ to provide $2,000 
worth of assistance to our brothers and 
sisters at the bottom end of economic 
income? This Chamber is better than 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, you can say a lot 
about this Congress, but you cannot 
say we have not worked together and 
appropriated remarkable funding to 
help families defeat this COVID, to get 
back on their feet, and to save small 
businesses. 
A good example is that, so far, Con-
gress, both parties, has already ap-
proved more than $20,800 in direct cash 
payments to a family of four with one 
parent out of work. That is on top of an 
estimated $18,000 of State unemploy-
ment benefits, a little less than $40,000 
to help working families survive this 
COVID pandemic. 
But, today, we do nothing in this bill 
to help 8 million Americans who lost 
their jobs due to COVID. We could dou-
ble the amount of money that goes to 
small businesses or midsize businesses 
so they can rehire the workers and 
keep them on the payroll to try to sur-
vive and ride this out. We don’t know 
yet what the vaccinations will do to 
consumer 
confidence 
or 
to 
the 
lockdowns. 
Again, I expect a number of Repub-
licans to support this bill. In my view, 
we would be wiser to assess the impact 
of the vaccinations in the recovery 
going forward so that we can target re-
lief to Main Street, to helping get peo-
ple back to work, and to truly stimu-
lating our local economy. That is 
where we address the harm that has 
been done by COVID. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
glad the ranking member reminded us 
of what we were able to accomplish to-
gether in the CARES Act, and I think 
that is what we are asking here again 
this evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. And 
I thank him for his masterful work in 
not only bringing this legislation to 
the floor but working in a bipartisan

way to have so many important initia-
tives in the COVID and the omnibus 
bill that the President happily, for us, 
signed last evening. I thank him for his 
initiatives that are job-creating, that 
stimulate the economy and help meet 
the needs of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I am interested in 
the comments made by Mr. BRADY be-
cause he said we could be putting more 
money into small business, and we do 
indeed in the COVID package, around 
$300 billion. I think it is important to 
note, Madam Speaker, that that brings 
it to almost about a trillion dollars 
since March 27 or 28, when the Presi-
dent signed the CARES Act, about $950 
billion for small business, nearly a tril-
lion dollars. Very important. 
Small business is the heart of our 
economy. What could be more opti-
mistic for anyone to do but to follow 
their dreams, start a small business, 
create jobs, create wealth, create cap-
ital. It is so important. We see the im-
portance of that to the tune of about a 
trillion dollars, just under a trillion 
dollars, in these past several months. 
Madam Speaker, if you want to talk 
about job creation, I hope the gen-
tleman will join us when we go forward 
to do State and local, our healthcare 
workers, honoring our heroes. They are 
at risk of losing their jobs. While they 
risk their lives to save lives, they may 
lose their jobs, and over a million of 
them have. 
We are talking about healthcare 
workers. We are talking about police 
and fire, our first responders. We are 
talking about transportation, sanita-
tion, food workers. We are talking 
about our teachers, our teachers, our 
teachers, the custodians of our children 
for a large part of their day. 
They are at risk of losing their jobs 
because of the failure of the Repub-
lican side of the aisle to support funds 
for State and local government to 
honor our heroes. We want to honor 
them. While we cheer them, we applaud 
them, let’s give them pay, and let’s let 
them have job security. Let’s give 
them PPE, the equipment that they 
need to do their job. 
If we want to talk about saving jobs 
or growing jobs for the purpose that 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Texas mentioned, how are we going to 
focus on the distribution and the ad-
ministration of the vaccine? Where do 
you think that happens but in city, 
county, and State hospitals, in large 
measure, by healthcare workers in 
those places, wherever it is distributed 
on an individual basis? They are the 
heart of the matter. 
That is why we need to go forward 
with another bill that invests in our 
State and local governments, not to 
talk about government, but to talk 
about services, healthcare services, 
education, transportation, making our 
lives possible, making our very exist-
ence possible by what they do. Without 
them, how do we function? 
Again, let’s create jobs, let’s save 
jobs, let’s grow jobs by administering 
this vaccine as fairly and as equitably 
as possible, and free to everyone in our 
country, because unless all of us are 
protected, none of us are protected. 
This $2,000, which I thank you for 
bringing it to the floor on Christmas 
Eve, was roundly rejected by Repub-
licans. We asked for unanimous con-
sent. This could already exist as a law 
if that had happened, but it didn’t. So, 
now, today, we have another chance. 
Some of the Republicans said: Oh, if 
they really wanted that, they would 
have called for a vote that day. 
That wasn’t true. It is important to 
note that was a pro forma session, and 
you had to have the consent of the Re-
publicans to bring the bill to the floor. 
They withheld their consent. 
So, here we are today, in a legislative 
day where we just act with the major-
ity to bring the legislation to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I hope it will enjoy 
strong bipartisan support. The Presi-
dent of the United States has put this 
forth as something that he wants to 
see, in part of his signing the legisla-
tion yesterday. I hope that that view 
will be shared by the Republicans in 
the Senate because we will pass this 
bill today, either under suspension or 
under a rule, where it just requires a 
majority vote. 
Under suspension, a two-thirds vote 
requires a large number of Republican 
votes, which I hope we will have be-
cause I do think that the American 
people would love to see that unity on 
their behalf. 
We are a consumer economy. Putting 
money into the hands of the American 
people is a boost to our economy. This 
isn’t a big stimulus package. The 
COVID bill is an emergency supple-
mental. But this piece will make it 
something very important to growing 
and sustaining our economy. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for the work that your committee 
did, Brandon and the others, for put-
ting in the dependent clause. Other-
wise, 16 years and under would get the 
direct payment. But, I mean, as a 
mother of five and grandmother of 
nine, I know that children are depend-
ent after 16 years of age, especially if 
they are still in school. There are oth-
ers who are dependent because of one 
thing or another, some physical chal-
lenges that they may have in life. Who 
knows what goes on in a family? 
Nonetheless, if they are dependent, 
they will be receiving a direct pay-
ment, another important boost for 
American working families, another 
important boost for our economy as we 
go forward. 
So I, again, thank the chairman for 
his work. It is a simple vote. Our goals 
have been to crush the virus, honor our 
heroes who help us crush the virus, and 
put money in the pockets of the Amer-
ican people. Today, we will be doing 
that right now. 
Legislation will be a lifeline for mil-
lions of Americans. It improves on the 
previously passed relief bill by includ-
ing dependents, ensuring that families 
with children in college, adults living 
with disabilities, or elderly family 
members can also receive relief. 
The Republicans have a choice. The 
Republicans have a choice: vote for 
this legislation or vote to deny the 
American people the bigger paychecks 
they need. To reject this would be a de-
nial of the economic challenges that 
people are facing, and it would deny 
them, again, the relief they need. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote for the aptly named 
CASH Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON
LEE). The gentleman from 
Texas has 9 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Massachusetts has 31⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, first, let me con-
gratulate the chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, Mr. NEAL, for 
working so closely together on our bi-
partisan priorities. 
Ending surprise medical bills when 
you go to the ER or you have a sched-
uled 
medical 
procedure, 
ensuring, 
starting at the end of the next year, for 
the first time, when you go to that doc-
tor’s procedure, you will have a true 
and honest bill in advance of that. It 
will be so crucial for so many patients. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank the 
chairman for working so closely in a 
bipartisan way on the COVID tax relief 
provisions in the first reforms of our 
temporary tax provisions in 5 years. I 
applaud Chairman NEAL for his work, 
and I have enjoyed working with him. 
The previous speaker talked about 
essential workers, our firefighters, our 
healthcare workers, others who have 
done such an amazing job. We had an 
opportunity earlier this year to help 
them. President Trump, in his execu-
tive order, proposed a payroll tax holi-
day for nearly 5 months for these work-
ers. That would have meant, for those 
essential workers, that firefighter, that 
hospital worker, that nurse, that a 
family of four would have kept an 
extra $5,000 in their paycheck through-
out the holidays. 
If we really wanted to help essential 
workers, our Democrat friends would 
not have blocked that payroll tax holi-
day and would have adopted our bill to 
make sure that those payroll taxes 
were forgiven. 
b 1645 
As for State and local governments, 
they, too—even though I disagree with 
many of the decisions—deserve our 
thanks. And, thankfully, because this 
was the most rapid labor market recov-
ery following a crisis in history and we 
recovered more than half the jobs we 
have lost, State and local revenues this 
year are almost even, down a mere less 
than 1 percent. 
Thank goodness Congress came to-
gether in the CARES Act to provide 
more than $150 billion to those State

and local governments to be able to ad-
dress these needs and continue to func-
tion. 
I will tell you, too, that—again, I 
speak only for myself—the best way to 
help struggling families is to get them 
back to work. The best way to save our 
Main Street is to give our small and 
medium-sized businesses more help 
than we have. This bill does neither. 
I don’t believe—I think it is correct 
when the earlier speaker said this is 
not a stimulus; it is not. And it does 
nothing to help get people back to 
work. 
I worry that, as we spend another 
nearly half a trillion dollars so hastily, 
we are not targeting this help to the 
very Americans who are struggling the 
most and need that help. 
I will also point out that, as I said 
earlier, Congress has come together to 
provide a family of four with one un-
employed parent, now, just a little 
short of $40,000 of Federal money in 
their traditional State unemployment 
because we knew they were struggling. 
Now is the time to get them back to 
work. That is my personal objection to 
this bill. 
I urge Congress to pause for a mo-
ment to assess the vaccinations over 
the next few months or year to deter-
mine where next we need to weigh in, if 
at all, on this recovery as we continue 
to work together to defeat this virus. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to be 
here today, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
I acknowledge the good efforts of 
Ranking Member BRADY on the energy 
front in the tax package, as well. It is 
a series of compromised measures. He 
did a terrific job, I think it is fair to 
say, on surprise billing, and not to 
mention USMCA. Those were very sub-
stantial 
accomplishments 
that 
the 
Ways and Means Committee led on in 
the 116th Congress. 
Mr. BRADY, as he was closing, men-
tioned that this measure he did not 
want to see treated as stimulus, and he 
is right; this is not about stimulus. 
This is about stability. 
This is about building a bridge for 
those people who are really hurting as 
we turn the page on this year. 
This is about those who are won-
dering how they are going to make the 
next rental payment, sustenance for 
the American family, how they might 
repair that automobile that sits in the 
garage idle because they couldn’t af-
ford it. 
That is what this is really about this 
evening. 
I started with Charles Dickens and 
‘‘A Christmas Carol’’ and the lessons of 
Jacob Marley, but let me conclude with 
a very simple description in ‘‘The Epic 
of America.’’ 
When asked what it was that set 
America apart from the rest of the 
world, it was suggested it was a habit 
of the heart, a kindness and a decency 
and a goodness. And let me close the 
debate on that basis and urge passage 
of the CASH Act and $2,000 for the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 9051. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—VETO MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 4 of House Resolution 
1271, the unfinished business is the fur-
ther consideration of the veto message 
of the President on the bill (H.R. 6395) 
to authorize appropriations for fiscal 
year 2021 for military activities of the 
Department of Defense, for military 
construction, and for defense activities 
of the Department of Energy, to pre-
scribe military personnel strengths for 
such fiscal year, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Will the House, on recon-
sideration, pass the bill, the objections 
of the President to the contrary not-
withstanding? 
(For veto message, see proceedings of 
the House of December 24, 2020.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, for the purpose of debate 
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
THORNBERRY), the ranking member of 
the committee, pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and insert extraneous 
material on the veto message of the 
President of the United States to the 
bill H.R. 6395. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for yielding and once again want 
to commend him for his stewardship of 
the committee through very chal-
lenging times. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to sup-
port this bill, as more than 80 percent 
of the House did just 20 days ago. It is 
the exact same bill, not a comma has 
changed. 
It still prevents the military from 
having their pay cut. It still creates 
new tools to deal with a newly aggres-
sive China. It still includes the impor-
tant U.S.-Israel Assistance Act and 
provides help for Vietnam veterans. 
One thing, I guess, is new in the past 
few 
days, 
because 
a 
devastating 
cyberattack by Russia has been ex-
posed; but, fortunately, this bill has 
dozens of provisions to help strengthen 
the country’s defenses in cyber. 
So the President has exercised his 
constitutional 
prerogative. 
Now, 
Madam Speaker, it is up to us. Our 
troops, the country, indeed, the world 
is watching to see what we will do, 
whether we can tune out other dif-
ferences and still come together to sup-
port the men and women of the mili-
tary and American national security. 
I would only ask that, as Members 
vote, they put the best interests of the 
country first. There is no other consid-
eration that should matter. This vote 
is about supporting our troops and de-
fending America. While not perfect, 
this bill does a good job of advancing 
both and should be supported once 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise to strongly urge Members to 
uphold what we did in this Chamber 
just a couple weeks ago and what the 
Senate did, as well; and that is we 
passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
bill, with roughly 80 percent of the vote 
in both the Senate and the House. 
The legislative branch made it abso-
lutely clear that we support this piece 
of legislation, and as the gentleman 
from Texas just noted, we support it 
with very good reason. 
It is enormously important to give 
our troops the support that they need 
to carry out the job that we all are 
asking them to do. That is, I think, one 
of our minimum obligations as Mem-
bers of Congress. And this bill reflects 
that. 
This bill is the process of a lengthy 
effort 
involving 
Members 
of 
both 
Chambers, both parties, that have 
come together and put together an in-
credibly strong piece of legislation. 
That is why it passed so overwhelm-
ingly just a couple weeks ago. And 
nothing has changed. Nothing has 
changed. The bill is exactly the same 
and every little bit as important. 
Now, the President has the right to 
veto it, but I think we, as Members of

December 28, 2020 
the legislative body, have to look at 
the reason behind that. Was it because 
of something in the bill? 
Pieces of legislation come through 
here all the time, and we occasionally 
miss something. The President finds 
out, and we say: Gosh, I didn’t know 
that. That is not what happened here. 
I really want Members to understand 
the President vetoed this because of 
something that isn’t in the bill and was 
never going to be in the bill, something 
totally unrelated to national security 
and something that we were not going 
to do in any event. 
There is literally no reason to veto 
this bill for the reasons that the Presi-
dent did and certainly no reason for us 
not to uphold what we did in passing 
this bill. This is really important that 
we exercise our legislative prerogative. 
There are all kinds of crucial provi-
sions in this bill, but I will just point 
to one, and that is the one that Mr. 
THORNBERRY mentioned earlier, to give 
you an idea of why it is important that 
the legislative branch do its job in ex-
ercising oversight of the Department of 
Defense in providing national security 
policy, and that is the cyber issue. 
Thanks to the leadership of Chair-
man LANGEVIN, chairman of the sub-
committee that deals with this issue, 
and Ranking Member STEFANIK, they 
have worked together to really put to-
gether an incredible package to try to 
better address these very cyber issues 
that we are now facing. That is what 
we do in this legislation, and it is not 
always exciting, but it is incredibly 
important to meet our obligation to 
our troops and to the national security 
of this country. 
It is enormously important that we 
pass this bill. We did it once. Let’s just 
do it one more time, and then we can 
all go home for the year. We can be 
done, and we can be proud of what we 
have accomplished. 
I urge Members to vote in favor of 
this bill to do what we did just a couple 
weeks ago. Show the country that the 
legislative branch can still do its job. 
I will close on one note, which we 
make a lot of times. 
b 1700 
This is the most bipartisan com-
mittee in Congress. That is not an easy 
thing to achieve. We have a lot of 
things that we passionately disagree 
about in this body, and we should, but 
on the Armed Services bill, we manage 
to come together. It is not always easy, 
but we get it done. 
I think it is enormously important 
that we let the country know that that 
process hasn’t died. We put together a 
product, a bipartisan, bicameral prod-
uct that has gotten an overwhelming 
number of votes. 
Let’s show the American public that 
the legislative process works at least a 
little bit better than sometimes they 
think it does, that we can get our job 
done and, in this case, get our job done 
for the men and women who put their 
lives on the line to protect this coun-
try. We owe them nothing less than 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in strong opposition to the Ad-
ministration’s seemingly callous veto of the 
William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 and 
proudly announce my intention to vote to over-
ride this reckless veto. 
I take this action because I disagree with 
the President that preserving monuments and 
memorials and naming military installations for 
the defenders of slavery who took up arms 
against the United States to achieve their aims 
is more important and a higher priority than 
providing the funding, resources, and support 
to the nation’s military and civilian defense 
person, one of the nation’s most respected in-
stitutions and its most diverse and representa-
tive. 
Other than his pique at being on the short 
end of what is by his own account an Electoral 
College landslide and being routed by seven 
million votes in his failed bid for reelection, 
there is absolutely no basis for the erstwhile 
Commander-in-Chief to veto the bipartisan 
NDAA and deny our servicemembers a long- 
overdue pay raise and hazard duty pay many 
of whom live in or are from my congressional 
district. 
It is cruel, shameful, and heartless for a 
Commander-in-Chief to deny to more than 
100,000 federal employees the paid family 
leave child care, housing and health protec-
tions authorized by the FY2021 NDAA or to 
withhold from our veterans the benefits that 
they need and deserve. 
The FY2021 NDAA Conference Report, ne-
gotiated under the careful stewardship of 
Chairman ADAM SMITH of Washington and 
Ranking Member MAC THORNBERRY in the 
House and Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman JAMES INHOFE of Oklahoma and 
Ranking Member JACK REED of Rhode Island 
is carefully crafted, exemplary legislation re-
flecting the nation’s sacred commitment to 
those who willingly risk their lives, fortunes, 
and sacred honor to keep our nation safe and 
preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. 
The FY21 NDAA provides a long-sought 
after benefit for tens of thousands of Vietnam- 
era veterans who are struggling with certain 
health complications after being exposed to 
Agent Orange while serving their country. 
In addition, the legislation authorizes $8.4 
billion in military construction projects to fortify 
critical infrastructure and base realignment 
and closure clean up, it contains important 
new tools to deter adversaries China and Rus-
sia from attacking or threatening our national 
interests; and mandates reforms to make the 
Pentagon more efficient, innovative, and cost- 
effective. 
In the legislation there are significant bipar-
tisan provisions to strengthen our posture on 
artificial intelligence and cybersecurity and to 
fortify our alliance with NATO and our security 
relationship with Israel. 
With the passage of the FY2021 NDAA, ex-
pectant mothers in the military could receive 
free loaner maternity uniforms because the 
legislation directs the Department of Defense 
to conduct a pilot program to issue maternity 
uniforms and related items to pregnant military 
members on a temporary and as-needed 
basis. 
Madam Speaker, this is important because 
women make up about 21 percent of the Air 
Force; 20.2 percent of the Navy; 15.4 percent 
of the Army; and 9 percent of the Marine 
Corps. 
Also, the FY2021 NDAA makes needed re-
forms to prevent sexual assault, a matter of 
great importance to the public and my col-
leagues, particularly those of us from Texas, 
where Fort Hood is located and where Army 
Specialist Vanessa Guille´n was murdered to 
prevent her from reporting the sexual harass-
ment and abuse she suffered from her direct 
superior in the chain of command. 
I am very grateful to Congressman BROWN 
of Maryland, himself a veteran of the Armed 
Services, for his leadership in ensuring the 
NDAA authorize and approve the renaming of 
military bases currently named for persons 
who took up arms for the Confederacy and 
against the United States. 
I am very pleased that included in the legis-
lation is my language directing the consider-
ation be given to distinguished and heroic Afri-
can-American 
and 
Native 
American 
servicemembers in the renaming of military 
bases. 
Removing the stain of bases and military in-
stallations being name for confederate traitors 
is an act of profound reconciliation and heal-
ing. 
For 
too 
long 
African 
Americans 
servicemembers have been forced to tolerate 
the hidden racism that existed under the guise 
of the rebel flag, knowing through oral history 
the brutality of those who voluntarily fought for 
the Confederacy. 
The FY2021 NDAA ushers in a new enlight-
ened era where the names of traitors who 
took up arms against the United States will 
have their names removed from places of 
honor such as military bases or installations. 
These individuals will not be forgotten; in-
stead they will have a permanent place in his-
tory and their records will be studied and ex-
amined in full by historians and scholars. 
Madam Speaker, it is also fitting that 
FY2021 NDAA directs the Department of De-
fense to take concrete actions to recognize 
and memorialize the contributions made by Af-
rican 
Americans 
and 
Native 
Americans 
servicemembers in defense of our nation. 
The history of African Americans and Native 
Americans serving in the military date back to 
the colonial period of our nation to the present 
day. 
In every war waged from the Battle of Lex-
ington to the Battle for Fallujah, African Ameri-
cans and Native Americans have honorably 
answered the call to duty, and served with 
great valor and distinction in America’s armed 
forces. 
At decisive moments in our nation’s history, 
the United States military and its citizens war-
riors answered the call and were decisive in 
the nation’s epic battles for freedom and lib-
erty, including: 
Revolutionary War (1776–1783); War of 
1812 (1812–1814); Mexican-American War 
(1836); Civil War (1861–1865); Spanish-Amer-
ican War (1898); World War I (1914–1918); 
World War II (1941–1945); Korean War 
(1950–1953); Vietnam War (1965–1975); Gulf 
War (1991); and Operations Enduring Free-
dom and Iraqi Freedom, as well as conflicts in 
other theaters of war.

The military was there doing a job no other 
branch of our nation’s government could do— 
in the face of overwhelming danger—when the 
fate of the American Experiment was on the 
line. 
Our thanks to the military for always an-
swering the call of duty—whether that call 
comes in the dead of night or the light of 
day—we know that we can count on you. 
The names and faces of millions of African 
Americans who have served our nation in uni-
form may fade from memory, but today we 
have the opportunity to remember and see 
them in the faces of the young men and 
women who preserved freedom in the world, 
even at a time when the blessings of liberty 
were denied to them at home. 
The Jackson Lee provision in the FY2021 
NDAA recognizes that there is no shortage of 
distinguished veterans, and especially African 
American and Native American veterans, who 
are worthy of the honor of naming a military 
facility in their honor. 
Let me provide for the record some rep-
resentative candidates. 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
General Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first black 
four-star general in the Army and 1951 West 
Point graduate who attended the service acad-
emy before the Army was desegregated and 
served in Korea and Vietnam, with valor deco-
rations in both conflicts, and as a training offi-
cer as part of the U.S. military support mission 
in Liberia. He went on to become the first 
black commander of the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, deputy chief of staff for operations in 
U.S. Army Europe, commander of U.S. Forces 
Japan, the U.S. representative on the NATO 
Military Committee. 
William Harvey Carney was the first African 
American recipient of the Congressional Medal 
of Honor, which he received for his actions on 
July 18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, 
while a member of the 54th Massachusetts 
Regiment in the Civil War—the state’s first all- 
black regiment. 
The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of 
the film, ‘‘Glory,’’ starring Denzel Washington 
and Morgan Freeman. 
Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams 
was appointed to lead the African American 
Women’s Army Corps unit designated as the 
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, 
which became known as the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight.’’ 
The ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ unit was instrumental 
in establishing and maintaining morale be-
cause it assured that mail from the battlefront 
and the home-front flowed efficiently and time-
ly. 
Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey of the Army 
Nurse Corps was the first nurse to be pro-
moted to lieutenant colonel. 
UNITED STATES NAVY 
Messman First Class Dorie Miller was serv-
ing in a noncombat role in the Navy, when he 
acted heroically to defend lives after his ship, 
the USS West Virginia was attacked at Pearl 
Harbor. 
He was the first African American to be 
awarded the Navy Cross, the third highest 
honor awarded by the United States Navy at 
the time. 
Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Ad-
miral and one of the highest-ranking African 
American women ever to serve in any branch 
of the military. Admiral Howard is also the first 
African American woman to command a U.S. 
naval vessel, the USS Rushmore. 
She is the Navy’s second highest ranking 
officer and is currently serving as the com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, com-
mander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe, and 
commander of Allied Joint Force Command 
Naples. 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Shawna Ro-
chelle-Kimbrell became the first female African 
American fighter pilot in the Air Force history 
and her flights in Northern Watch marked her 
as the first female pilot to fly combat missions 
for Misawa’s 35th Fighter Wing and the first 
African American woman to employ ordinance 
in combat. She has logged more than 1,110 
hours in the F–16, including 176 hours of 
combat time. 
Colonel Ruth A. Lucas was the first African 
American woman in the Air Force to be pro-
moted to the rank of colonel. At the time of 
her retirement in 1970, she was the highest- 
ranking African American woman in the Air 
Force. 
In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. be-
came the first African American Major General 
in the United States Air Force. As the orga-
nizer and commander of famed 332nd Fighter 
Group known as the Tuskegee Airmen, his 
place in history will be forever remembered 
and revered. 
General Davis received many decorations 
during his career, including two Distinguished 
Service Medals and a Silver Star and on De-
cember 9, 1998, General Davis was awarded 
his fourth general’s star by President Bill Clin-
ton. 
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 
Chief Petty Officer Alex Haley is best known 
for writing letters for his shipmates and his 
short stories and articles, which got him pro-
moted to Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard 
in 1959. 
Haley ultimately received a number of mili-
tary honors, including the American Defense 
Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal 
and an honorary degree from the Coast Guard 
Academy but most of you know him also as 
the author of ‘‘Roots,’’ the path-breaking and 
epic retracing of a family’s history from the 
Gambian coast in Africa to the New World in 
America. 
In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the 
first African American Coast Guard aviator. He 
later became the first African American to 
reach the rank of Captain and the first to com-
mand a Coast Guard air station. He accumu-
lated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different 
types of aircrafts. 
Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the today’s 
active duty military is comprised of persons of 
color, of which 17.8 percent are African Amer-
ican. 
This percentage outpaces the percentage of 
African Americans in the general population 
(13 percent) but lagging significantly is the 9% 
of African Americans in the commissioned offi-
cer ranks. 
NATIVE AMERICANS 
The Jackson Lee Amendment offered during 
House consideration of the NDAA was ex-
panded to include Native Americans. 
It is without doubt that the military has a sto-
ried history of Native American contributions to 
the securing our nation since colonial times to 
the present. 
One famous example of their contributions 
occurred during World War II when the U.S. 
military developed a specific policy to recruit 
and train Navajo speakers to become ‘‘code 
talkers.’’ 
Code Talker is the name given to 29 Navajo 
Natives who used their tribal language to send 
secret communications on the battlefield. 
The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talk-
ers, who created a code based on the com-
plex, unwritten Navajo language. 
The code primarily used word association 
by assigning a Navajo word to key phrases 
and military tactics. 
This system enabled the Code Talkers to 
translate three lines of English in 20 seconds, 
not 30 minutes as was common with existing 
codebreaking machines. 
The Code Talkers participated in every 
major Marine operation in the Pacific theater, 
giving the Marines a critical 
advantage 
throughout the war. 
During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo 
Jima, for example, six Navajo Code Talker 
Marines successfully transmitted more than 
800 messages without error. 
Marine leadership noted after the battle that 
the Code Talkers were critical to the victory at 
Iwo Jima. 
The Navajo Code was never broken. 
Our Native American brothers and sisters 
are more than worthy to be so honored by 
having their names considered for military 
bases and installations. 
BOOGALOO AND PROUD BOYS 
Another Jackson Lee Amendment included 
in the House version of the NDAA directed the 
Secretary of Defense to report to Congress 
the extent, if any, of the threat to national se-
curity posed by domestic terrorist groups and 
organizations motivated by a belief system of 
white supremacy, such as extremist groups 
like the Boogaloo Boys and the Proud Boys, 
is reflected in the Conference bill. 
The concern is that in the aftermath of a 
historic national election, the activity of vio-
lence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud 
Boys will increase and lead to attacks becom-
ing more frequent. 
We have witnessed too many instances of 
violent extremists searching for opportunities 
to sow violence and disrupt democratic proc-
esses and Boogaloo and Proud Boys are tar-
geting constitutionally protected activity to 
coopt or to provide cover for attacks. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a 
recommendation made by the Cyberspace So-
larium Commission to require the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to develop a strategy to 
implement Domain-based Message Authen-
tication, 
Reporting, 
and 
Conformance 
(DMARC) standard across U.S.-based email 
providers to increase the security of email, 
The security of email has grown in impor-
tance as it has become in many ways the pri-
mary way that businesses, consumers, gov-
ernment communicate. 
The Senate bill also addressed this impor-
tant issue and the language of the final Con-
ference concurs. 
For all these reasons, I urge all Members to 
join me in voting to override the President’s 
unwise and ill-considered veto of the William 
M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Will the House, on recon-
sideration, pass the bill, the objections

HONORING THE LIFE OF PETER 
EDWARD JONES 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Peter Edward Jones who 
passed away on October 20, 2020. Peter was 
a husband, father, and decorated veteran of 
World War II and the Korean War. 
Peter was born on January 26, 1926 in 
Emmetsburg, Iowa to John and Madeline 
Jones. He was one of five children, and was 
raised in Sacramento, California where he 
graduated in 1943 at Grant Union High 
School. With the onset of World War II, Peter 
decided to join the Navy at 17 years old. He 
believed that a strong commitment to service 
was his way of showing support for his coun-
try. 
During his time in the military, Peter was 
stationed at the South Pacific during the war 
and served until 1946. From 1950 to 1951, 
Peter served in the Korean War where he 
joined in the reserves. He was honorably dis-
charged and decided to move to Fresno and 
in 1948, Peter married the love of his life, An-
toinette Catherine Caglia. They raised five 
children, Gerard, Peter, Janice, Timothy, and 
Richard. Antoinette and Peter were married for 
67 happy years until her passing in 2015. 
Peter worked for The Fresno Bee for 57 
years and 3 months, served Our Lady of Vic-
tory Church as a lector for many years and 
even helped to build the covenant to the 
church. Peter lived for 95 years dedicating his 
life for others, his country, and loving his fam-
ily. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in 
celebrating and honoring the life of Peter Ed-
ward Jones. His love for his country, family, 
and his strong faith was evident. I join his fam-
ily and friends in honoring his great life.

HONORING HELLENIC AND AMER-
ICAN PHILHELLENIC WOMEN OF 
THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPEND-
ENCE 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, as co-chair and co-founder 
of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic 
Issues, I rise today to honor the heroic Hel-
lenic and American Philhellenic Women of the 
Greek War of Independence, whose con-
sequential actions helped free Greece and her 
people from the yoke of the Ottoman Empire. 
As a member of the East Mediterranean 
Business Culture Alliance’s American Hellenic 
Revolution 
Bicentennial 
Celebration 
Com-
mittee, and as we approach the 200th anniver-
sary of the Greek War of Independence, it is 
incumbent upon all of us to honor the legacy 
of these women and recognize how their ac-
tions influenced the relationship between the 
United States and Greece. 
I have the unique privilege of representing 
one of the largest Greek American commu-
nities in the U.S. in Astoria, Queens, and I am 
blessed to call many of them close friends. 
I’m especially honored that my friends in the 
Hellenic community have bestowed me with 
the nickname ‘‘Bouboulina’’ after Laskarina 
Bouboulina, one of the many great warriors of 
the Greek War of Independence and whose 
home I had the privilege of visiting in 2016. 
Bouboulina was a trailblazer in her own right 
and committed herself to the cause of a free 
and independent Greek state. 
And I rise not only to honor these brave 
women, but also recognize the Greek people’s 
contributions to democracy, art, science, and 
literature, and to governments around the 
world, including our own. 
As the birthplace of democracy, Greece was 
an inspiration for the U.S. system of govern-
ment. And just as Greece inspired our country, 
our revolution helped inspire the Greeks to re-
volt against the Ottomans. 
When the Greek War of Independence start-
ed, American Philhellenes and Greek Amer-
ican communities in the U.S. not only voiced 
their support for the cause, but actively sup-
ported their campaign. 
Greek Committees were formed in cities 
across the country to organize political and 
monetary support and send shiploads of hu-
manitarian supplies to Greek revolutionaries. It 
may be safe to say that without the moral, in-
tellectual, political, monetary and in-kind as-
sistance of these Americans, the outcome of 
the Greek War for Independence might have 
been different. 
The ideals of freedom and democracy reso-
nated for Americans who saw the plight of the 
Greeks suffering brutal slavery and massacres 
under the Ottoman Turkish oppressors. When 
the bells of the Revolution rang in 1821 and 
the cry ‘‘Freedom or Death’’ rang over the 
enslaved Greeks, American Philhellenes in-
spired a lobbying campaign in the United 
States for support of the Greek War of Inde-
pendence, exciting the imaginations of many 
influential political and civil leaders in America. 
American 
Philhellenes 
fought 
to 
help 
Greece win freedom from over four hundred 
years of brutal tyranny and slavery under Otto-
man Turks. These distinguished Americans in-
cluded: President Thomas Jefferson, President 
John Adams, General Lafayette, President 
James 
Monroe, 
President 
John 
Quincy 
Adams, General Lafayette, Daniel Webster, 
Henry Clay, General Sam Houston, Edward 
Livingston, Horace Mann, Dr. Edward Everett, 
Lieutenant General George Jarvis, Colonel 
Johnathan P. Miller, James L. Winthrop, Henry 
V. Post, John D. Ross, John R. Stuyvesant, 
William A. Washington, William Townsend 
Washington, Captain John M. Allen, Estwick 
Evans, 
Nicholas 
Biddle, 
Charles 
Carroll, 
Mathew Carey, George Wilson, James Wil-
liams, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, and many 
others. Many of these same Philhellenes 
fought in the Greek War of Independence, 
some of whom lost their lives and are buried 
there. 
For the deeds of heroism and valor dis-
played at Missolonghi during the four years of 
siege by the Ottoman Empire from 1822 to 
1826, the city has become the ‘‘shrine’’ of the 
Greek War of Independence. All nations 
whose Philhellenes aided Greece in its cause 
have monuments in the Garden of Heroes in 
memory of those who died in the Greek War 
of Independence. These monuments include a 
memorial erected by the Order of Sons of 
Pericles, the Junior Order of AHEPA in 1939, 
placed there by Congressional Resolution in 
memory of the American Philhellenes, which 
reads: 
‘‘As a tribute to and in commemoration of 
those patriotic Americans who, aided by the 
moral and material support and assistance of 
the entire American people, gave their serv-
ices, their fortunes, and their lives to the 
cause of Greek Independence in the Greek 
Revolutionary War of 1821.’’ 
Most notably, many of these American 
Philhellenes included future leaders of the 
Women’s Suffrage and Abolitionist move-
ments. 
As American women became involved in the 
effort, they connected the battle against Greek 
slavery under the Ottoman Empire with other 
female-led reform movements and over time 
their participation grew into an international 
movement, expanding female participation in 
the public sphere for both American and 
Greek women. 
Among the Philhellenes was Samuel Gridley 
Howe, an American physician and prominent 
Abolitionist, a member of the Secret Six, and 
an advocate of education, and education for 
the blind. He took up the Greek cause after 
earning a medical degree by joining the Greek 
army as Chief Surgeon of the Hellenic Navy 
and Commander during the Greek War of 
Independence. 
Howe was married to fellow Philhellene 
Julia Rush Ward Howe, an Abolitionist and 
early leader in the Women’s Suffrage move-
ment. She’s known as the composer of the 
lyrics of the ‘‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’’ 
which became an anthem during the Civil War 
for Abolitionists, the anti-slavery movement, 
women’s suffrage activists, and was quoted by 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. throughout the civil 
rights movement. 
Emma Willard, who formed the Troy Society 
for the Advancement of Female Education in 
Greece, was one of the most outspoken advo-
cates for the education of women. 
Among America’s prominent Abolitionists 
and supporters of the Underground Railroad 
were Sarah Arms Miller and her husband, 
Colonel Johnathan P. Miller, who fought in the 
Greek War of Independence. He adopted a 
Hellenic orphan of the revolution, Lucas 
Miltiades Miller, who later became the first 
Greek American to serve in the U.S. Con-
gress. Many children orphaned during the

became 
adoptees and were brought to America, ulti-
mately becoming prominent American citizens, 
scholars, and members of the armed services. 
And James Williams, an African American 
slave from Baltimore, joined the Greek revolu-
tionaries and fought for Greece’s freedom dur-
ing the Battle of Navarino and was buried 
there in honor of his efforts. 
Trailblazers like Bouboulina, Willard, and 
Miller—who toppled their oppressors, de-
manded equality, and fought to enact change 
to benefit future generations of women—in-
spire my work in Congress every day. 
The example set by Hellenic and American 
Philhellenic women during the Greek War of 
Independence exemplifies the U.S.-Greece re-
lationship that thrives to this day. It is because 
of our historic friendship, and shared commit-
ment to liberal democratic values, that the 
U.S. and Greece continue to work on so many 
issues that have a profound effect on the 
world. 
After generations of oppression, Greece’s 
freedom was hard-fought, and the Republic of 
Greece has become a shining example of de-
mocracy to the world. Greece and the Greek 
people are such critical allies and dear friends 
of the United States and I’m very proud to rise 
today in honor of the brave Hellenic and 
American Philhellenic women who played a 
pivotal role in securing the independence that 
Greece and her people celebrate to this day.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FAIV 
NTAJ MUAS (DANG MOUA) 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Faiv Ntaj Muas (Dang 
Moua), who passed away on October 13, 
2020 at the age of 71. Dang was a longtime 
Merced County business owner and an active 
member of the Hmong community. 
Dang was born on April 12, 1949 in the war- 
torn country of Laos to Muas Paj Cai and 
Ntxhais Lauj. Dang was the second of three 
sons, and had an elder half-brother, five sis-
ters, four half-brothers, and two half-sisters. 
Although Dang faced a difficult childhood, he 
always had a heart for service and helping 
others. After completing grade school, he at-
tended college near a hospital that treated in-
jured soldiers. Over time, Dang’s soft-spoken 
demeanor was recognized by his peers and 
he was hand-picked as a leader by the 
Hmong community to provide guidance to fel-
low students. 
As the war continued, Dang and his fellow 
students were no longer safe at their school, 
His quick thinking allowed opportunity for him 
to save nine people out of Samthong, where 
the enemy soldiers were approaching. Their 
journey led them through the mountains, and 
numerous towns to seek shelter until they 
were finally safe. 
In 1971, Dang married the love of his life, 
Paj Lis and began training with the United 
States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) and was recruited by the United 
States Embassy to work in USAID until 1975. 
In April of 1975, part of Dang’s family moved 
to a refugee camp in Thailand for safety, after 
it became clear the situation was unsafe for 
anyone aiding the United States. Eventually, 
Dang and part of his family, were sponsored 
by Hatcher Memorial Baptist Church and 
moved to Richmond, Virginia in 1977, before 
settling in Merced, California. Once they set-
tled in Merced, Dang attended college, and 
worked at Del Monte Farms. 
Dang and his wife opened their first busi-
ness, the first Hmong grocery store in Merced, 
Moua Oriental Market, followed by the first 
Hmong farm and slaughterhouse, Moua’s Hog 
Slaughter Farm and Moua’s Cattle Farm in 
Livingston, California. His success and influ-
ence in the community reached political fig-
ures, Hmong community, and many individ-
uals. 
Dang will be remembered in the community 
for helping others, his work in establishing the 
nonprofit organization Merced Lao Family Inc., 
filling a void for Hmong businesses in Merced 
County, and being a role model to so many. 
He was a leader and a caring individual that 
will be remembered by all who had the pleas-
ure to work with him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Dang Moua. His 
commitment to the community of Merced 
County has left a lasting impact on many. I 
join his family and friends in honoring his great 
life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BERNARD ‘‘BERNIE’’ MCKINNON 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to 
a dear friend and labor leader, Bernard ‘‘Ber-
nie’’ McKinnon, who we recently lost unex-
pectedly. Bernie was a wonderful friend, col-
league, and mentor to many, and he will be 
deeply missed by all of those fortunate 
enough to have known him. 
Bernie grew up in Caribou, Maine, along 
with his five siblings, before the family moved 
to Connecticut. Upon his graduation from high 
school, he joined his parents, as well as the 
United Autoworkers of America, when he 
began working at Fafnir Bearing. From the 
very beginning, Bernie was a dedicated mem-
ber of UAW, and it was his passion for fair-
ness and justice that led to his eventual career 
with the labor organization. He worked his way 
through the ranks of his local union, eventually 
becoming a long-time Local 133 President. He 
was later elected UAW Region 9A CAP Presi-
dent and then CAP Director, where he took on 
the responsibility of ensuring that the voices of 
UAW members were heard throughout the hall 
of state legislatures throughout New England. 
Bernie was also a mentor to many in Con-
necticut’s labor movement, often sought after 
for advice and guidance in navigating the nu-
ances of the state’s General Assembly and 
the best ways in which to ensure that their 
legislative agendas were heard. He was also 
at the forefront of mobilizing UAW political ac-
tivity in local, state, and federal elections, or-
ganizing volunteers and the activities in which 
they would participate. 
It was in 1991 that Bernie was recruited to 
work as a legislative activist for the UAW in 
Washington, D.C. and that was where I had 
the opportunity to really get to know Bernie. I 
can distinctly remember the first part of our 
exchange when he visited the office. I would 
say ‘‘how are you doing Bernie’’ and his reply, 
without fail, was ‘‘terrible, Rosa . . . just ter-
rible’’—but his slight smile gave him away 
every time. In the near decade that he spent 
on the Hill, Bernie earned the respect of Mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle, because he 
was straight-forward and genuine—when he 
spoke, he just gave you the plain truth about 
how an issue would impact working people. 
Bernie’s contributions also extended far be-
yond his work on behalf of the UAW and its 
members. In his lifetime, he was a cub scout 
master, a Southington Band Backer, a trustee 
for the Southington Elks, a member of the 
Southington Democratic Town Committee, and 
a board member of several organizations in-
cluding Catholic Family Services, the United 
Labor Agency, and the New Britain United 
Way. In his retirement, he served as President 
of the UAW Local 133 retiree chapter as well 
as an active member of the Connecticut Alli-
ance of Retired Americans. He helped to es-
tablish the Connecticut Citizens Action Group 
and served on its Board of Directors for many 
years. 
His 
good 
work 
and 
compassion 
touched countless lives and his commitment to 
community and service should serve as a 
model for us all. 
I, like so many others, consider myself fortu-
nate to not only have known Bernard ‘‘Bernie’’ 
McKinnon, but to have called him my friend. I 
extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, 
Judie; his children, Ken, Lisa, and Jill; his 
grandchildren, and great-granddaughter as 
well as his many family, friends and col-
leagues at this difficult time. Though he was 
taken suddenly and much too soon, his is a 
life and legacy that will most certainly serve as 
an inspiration to many.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GERARD 
LOZANO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of longtime Fresnan Gerard 
Lozano, who passed away on October 1, 
2020. He was a proud husband, community 
leader and friend. 
Gerard was born on May 11, 1970 in Fres-
no, California. He grew up with four brothers, 
his father Michael, and mother Dolores. He at-
tended Our Lady of Victory Elementary School 
and graduated from San Joaquin Memorial 
High School. Gerard was known for being 
kind, always happy and caring. He had a 
strong faith and was a genuine leader by ex-
ample. 
These qualities continued throughout his life 
and during his career. Gerard began his ca-
reer as the Governmental Affairs Director for 
the Fresno Association of REALTORS inter-
acting with many people in the community and 
legislative representatives in the Central Val-
ley. 
My office and myself, had the pleasure of 
working alongside Gerard for many years. He 
was always a knowledgeable and professional 
individual, willing to help for the community in

any capacity that he could. Gerard’s hard work 
was evident throughout his career. He was 
promoted to Executive Vice President after 
being employed over 20 years at Fresno As-
sociation of REALTORS, and in 2016, Gerard 
was honored with the Presidents Award by 
past president, Colleen Wiginton. 
In 2002, Gerard met the love of his life, 
Donna or ‘‘Dolly’’ as she was affectionately 
known. Their love for each other flourished 
throughout their marriage. Gerard was a foot-
ball fan for the Oakland Raiders and San 
Francisco Giants. He enjoyed music and was 
a drummer. 
Gerard is survived by his wife, Donna; par-
ents Michael and Dolores Lozano; brothers 
Daniel, David and wife Marisela; Raymond 
and 
wife 
Kristin; 
Benjamin 
and 
wife 
Esmeralda; sister-in-law Linda Donabed and 
husband Jim. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life of Mr. 
Gerard Lozano. His kindness and leadership 
will be remembered by those who had the 
pleasure of working with him. I join his family, 
friends, and the community in honoring his 
great life and legacy.

HONORING THE SEVENTIETH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR 
AND THE BATTLE OF JANGJIN 
RESERVOIR 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Seventieth Anniversary 
of the Battle of Jangjin Reservoir. I am proud 
to join those who worked tirelessly to ensure 
this milestone is recognized and honor the 
service of those who fought during this crucial 
event. 
In November of 1950, approximately 15,000 
brave service men and women in the United 
States Marines and Army soldiers and another 
15,000 United Nations troops fought under the 
leadership of General Douglas MacArthur 
against approximately 120,000. The brutal 
conditions of war these soldiers faced were 
compounded by being in a mountainous re-
gion of North Korea, where they endured 
below-freezing temperatures, severe losses, 
and an agonizing retreat. 
Despite these trials and tribulations, enemy 
forces were stopped in the mountains. ‘‘The 
Chosin Few,’’ named in honor of the Japanese 
pronunciation of the Jangjin Reservoir, helped 
evacuate 100,000 North Korean men, women, 
and children. This impressive rescue operation 
resulted in one of the most dramatic, large- 
scale humanitarian events of the war. 
Those involved in the Battle of Jangjin Res-
ervoir have rightfully been awarded a total of 
seventeen Medals of Honor, seventy Navy 
Crosses, 
twelve 
Distinguished 
Service 
Crosses, and 9,000 Purple Hearts for their ac-
tions. This represents the most awards of this 
nature for a single battle in United States mili-
tary history. 
The people of New Jersey’s Ninth Congres-
sional district and many across our nation are 
indebted to those courageous individuals who 
overcame great burdens and made tremen-
dous sacrifices overseas. In a recognition of 
this service, my home state of New Jersey 
named a nearly forty-mile portion of Route 35 
stretching from Brielle to Aberdeen the Chosin 
Few Memorial Highway. It is a small fraction 
of respect and honor these exceptional individ-
uals deserve. 
That is why I am proud to recognize the te-
nacious serving as members of the United 
States Armed Forces and the Memorial 
Committtee of the Battle of Jangjin Reservoir 
for their strong character and notable deter-
mination.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAFER 
JOHNSON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Rafer Johnson, a notable ath-
lete and Gold Olympic medalist recently 
passed away on December 2, 2020. 
Johnson was born in Hillsboro, Texas on 
August 18, 1934. When he was nine years 
old, he and his family moved to Kingsburg, 
CA. While attending high school, he was on 
the football, basketball, and baseball teams. 
He served as Class President both in junior 
high and high school. Johnson competed in a 
high school invitational decathlon and won the 
event. He also won the 1953 and 1954 Cali-
fornia state high school decathlon meets. 
After 
graduating 
from 
Kingsburg 
High 
School, he attended the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles. He joined Pi Lamda Phi 
fraternity and served as Student Body Presi-
dent. He competed in his first decathlon in 
1954 as a sophomore at UCLA. In 1955, he 
competed and won a gold medal at the Pan 
American Games in Mexico City. He was the 
first Black American to be the flag bearer for 
the U.S. Olympic team. He continued his ath-
letic journey and eventually won a silver medal 
in the 1956 Olympic decathlon in Melbourne, 
Australia. 
In 1960, he competed once again in the 
Olympics, held in Rome, Italy. He faced a 
unique challenge, as he competed against a 
fellow UCLA alumni and friend, Yang Chuan- 
Kwang. While both posed fierce challenges, 
Johnson won the gold medal. For his Olympic 
performance, Johnson received the James E. 
Sullivan Memorial Award, as the outstanding 
amateur athlete of 1960. 
After graduating from UCLA and finishing 
his decathlon career, Johnson embarked into 
a new chapter and began his film and media 
career. He worked in motion pictures as a 
sportscaster and then as a sports anchor on 
the local NBC affiliate in Los Angeles. 
Johnson also worked on the presidential 
election campaign of U.S. Senator Robert F. 
Kennedy and was there when he was assas-
sinated. He was able to subdue the gunman. 
He later got involved in the Special Olympics, 
serving on the organizing committee. In 1979, 
he was asked to join the board of the com-
mittee working to bring the 1984 Summer 
Olympics to Los Angeles. 
Johnson had a bright and impactful career 
with many great achievements. In 2005, John-
son was awarded an honorary Doctor of Hu-
mane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier 
College. In November 2014, Johnson received 
the Athletes in Excellence Award from The 
Foundation for Global Sports Development, in 
recognition of his community service efforts 
and work with youth. 
Rafer Johnson Junior High School in 
Kingsburg, California is named after Johnson, 
as are Rafer Johnson Community Day School 
and Rafer Johnson Children’s Center, both in 
Bakersfield, California. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring Mr. Rafer 
Johnson. His legacy and teachings will live in 
many for years to come. I join his family, 
friends and the community in celebrating his 
great life and legacy.

HONORING KACIA CAIN AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise before 
the House to recognize Kacia Cain, an Iowan 
who has dedicated her life to teaching stu-
dents about the importance of STEM. Kacia 
has devoted her life to encouraging Iowans to 
participate and foster a love and appreciation 
for STEM. She has inspired, motivated and 
provided a platform for so many students and 
individuals in Iowa to cultivate their apprecia-
tion for the sciences. That is why I want to 
honor Kacia as Iowan of the Week for the 
week of December 25th. 
Kacia grew up in Ames, Iowa before she 
graduated from Iowa State University, and 
then moved on to get her master’s degree in 
biology from Northwestern State in Louisiana. 
Kacia had always been interested in science 
and biology and worked as a veterinary assist-
ant. While she was in grad school, however, 
she was able to teach as a part of an 
assistantship program. She claims she fell 
promptly in love with teaching and made the 
decision to get certified and come back to 
Iowa to teach. Kacia is currently a teacher at 
Winterset High School, but previously was 
teaching students from all five high schools at 
Des Moines Central Campus. 
As a science teacher, her goal in the class-
room has been to introduce her students to a 
varied group of subjects, such as anatomy, 
physiology, genetics, and microbiology. An im-
portant aspect to Kacia’s curriculum is to use 
more than the resources that can be accessed 
in a classroom. Kacia and her students were 
able to learn from various people within the 
community. Pre-COVID–19, they were able to 
take trips and bring in individuals to allow a 
perspective of what STEM can look like in the 
real world. They traveled to colleges so that 
students could better visualize themselves as 
a college STEM student and see and under-
stand the components of what a future in the 
sciences could look like. 
One of Kacia’s favorite parts of being a 
teacher is being able to take a difficult concept 
and bring it to a level that students can better 
comprehend. The ability to see and under-
stand a concept that she helped morphed into 
a lesson that the student can take with them 
even after the year is over is not only reward-
ing for Kacia, but it also simply helps the 
sciences and opens the idea of STEM for 
more students.

Her role as a STEM teacher landed her a 
spot on the STEM Council and Executive 
Committee in September 2013 where she has 
since served on the Business Engagement 
Committee that built the ‘‘Guidelines for 
School+Business Partnerships in STEM’’ and 
contributed to the STEM Council’s Seal of Ap-
proval. She has also since been honored as 
STEM MVP and received the Iowa STEM 
Teacher Award. 
Now a teacher at Winterset High School, 
Kacia’s goal remains the same. She wishes to 
work hard to ensure that all Iowans can ac-
cess the same opportunities, materials, and 
resources that are available everywhere, 
whether you be in an urban or a rural setting. 
Kacia said she has always believed that 
STEM is about building partnerships through 
links beyond school walls and is excited to be 
a part of a group in a state that puts that idea 
at the forefront. Kacia is an example of how 
dedicated, selfless, and incredible hard work 
teachers and Iowans are. I cannot thank Kacia 
Cain enough for all she’s done to help the 
young people of our community, and I couldn’t 
be happier to name her as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BRUCE 
BRONZAN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of longtime Fresnan and former 
State Assembly member, Bruce Bronzan, who 
passed away on September 28, 2020. 
Bruce was born on September 28, 1947 in 
Fresno, California. He was a distinguished 
alumnus of California State University, Fresno 
and was a former Student Body President in 
the late 1960s. While serving as President, he 
found his calling for public service. This pas-
sion was the beginning of a lifetime career of 
strong leadership in service. 
Bruce served on the Fresno County Board 
of Supervisors from 1975 until 1982, when he 
was elected to the California State Assembly, 
representing the Fresno area. During his time 
in state legislature, he focused on health care 
and mental health policy. He held key posi-
tions including Chairman of the Assembly 
Health Committee and Select Committee on 
Mental Health. As a result, he wrote hundreds 
of pieces of legislation relating to health care. 
He played a key role in the passage of the 
Mental Health Reform Act. 
After serving in the State Legislature for 
eleven years, Bruce became the Associate 
Dean for Administration and Development at 
the University of California, San Francisco 
(UCSF) from 1993 to 1997; where he 
furthered his efforts and commitment for 
health care education and policy. Bruce’s 
major objective was to help build a model 
health care delivery system to address the 
shortage of primary doctors in the San Joa-
quin Valley. His contributions helped transform 
UCSF Fresno into the institution that is now. 
His vision created a path for the future of 
health care. 
Additionally, he also served as a Senior 
Scholar with the UCSF Phil Lee Institute of 
Health Policy Studies and President of Trilogy, 
a healthcare internet company that developed 
web portals for health and human services for 
counties and states. 
Bruce is survived by wife, Jeri; his son For-
est Bronzan and wife Laura; and daughter 
Chloe Bronzan. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life my 
friend Mr. Bruce Bronzan. I join his family, 
friends and community in honoring his great 
life and legacy.

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember Samuel H. Altman’s legacy 
in the Lowcountry. 
A true Charlestonian, Sam was born and 
raised in the Lowcountry. Sam was a hard 
worker and began working in his father’s fur-
niture shop, studied hard in school, and went 
on to become an attorney for 54 years. He 
met a beautiful and talented artist named 
Susan, who ended up stealing his heart. They 
spent 55 magical years together, traveling 
often, and spending time with their children. 
Sam had many different interests and cre-
ative pursuits in life. He loved the Big Easy 
and would visit New Orleans time and time 
again. Sam took pride in the sights and culture 
of Charleston, and felt called to serve on the 
City of Charleston Board of Zoning Adjustment 
for over 25 years. Sam was a frequent fan in 
the stands at the College of Charleston Cou-
gar basketball games, but was also the num-
ber one fan and biggest champion of Susan’s 
art. 
Sam was a man of integrity who led by ex-
ample and was happy to help any and every-
one. It was a privilege to know him and a 
blessing to call him a friend. My thoughts and 
prayers go out to his family, friends, and loved 
ones mourning his passing.

HONORING THE CAREER OF THE 
HONORABLE MAX RODRIGUEZ 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of my good friend Max Rodri-
guez. Supervisor Rodriguez is a longtime 
Madera County Supervisor for District 4 and a 
trusted leader in our community. Supervisor 
Rodriguez is retiring after serving on the 
Board of Supervisors for the past 15 years. 
Supervisor Rodriguez was born and raised 
in Madera, California. He graduated from 
Madera High School in 1958 and went to 
Fresno City College. Shortly after, Supervisor 
Rodriguez took jobs working in the fields in 
order to provide for his family. He then began 
working for American Forest Products, known 
as North Fork Sawmill, for 25 years. During 
his time at the sawmill, Supervisor Rodriguez 
was the Financial Secretary and President of 
the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union. In 
1985 when the sawmill closed, Supervisor

HONORING JOSH NUSS AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, today I want 
to honor an Iowan who is fighting for change 
and 
assistance 
for 
those 
who 
have 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS or also 
known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Executive Di-
rector of the Iowa ALS Society, Josh Nuss, 
has been a leading champion in our state for 
those diagnosed with this tragic, progressive 
and misunderstood disease. I am proud to 
honor Josh as our Iowan of the Week. 
Earlier in December, I was proud to vote for 
a bill that ensure those who have ALS can re-
ceive social security benefits as soon as they 
receive their diagnosis. I’m glad to see that bill 
signed into law, which is going to offer finan-
cial assistance to those with this disease. But 
perhaps no one was more excited to see this 
legislation pass than Josh, who listened to the 
vote happen live as it passed the Senate and 
then the House. Josh said it was amazing to 
hear Senators and Representatives from 
across the country speak on behalf of those 
with ALS. He hopes too that this bill will open 
the door to other rare diseases and illnesses 
who need assistance too. 
Josh’s work with ALS began in 2004 when 
he first met Iowans with this rare but fatal dis-
ease. When in 2014, he had the opportunity to 
join the Iowa ALS Chapter, he jumped at it. 
The work he does is deeply meaningful be-
cause he is ‘‘helping the best people at the 
worst time of their lives’’, he said. As part of 
Executive Director for Iowa ALS, Josh’s work 
include advocacy and supporting our commu-
nity. Iowa ALS helps those with ALS learn 
about their care options, invest in research, 
and hold community events like the annual 
‘‘Walk for ALS’’ here in Des Moines and the 
national Ice Bucket Challenge that raises 
money—and awareness—for those with ALS. 
As part of Josh’s work, he makes multiple trips 
from Iowa to Washington D.C. each year, 
meeting with our lawmakers to rally support 
for ALS research, funding, and of course this 
bill. Josh made this trip on behalf of Iowans 
with ALS who could not, bringing their stories 
to legislators across Iowa and Washington. 
Josh’s passion for Iowa is clear. He’s 
served our communities in so many ways and 
we’re lucky to have him during this extremely 
difficult time, as the pandemic has not only 
been frightening for those with longterm ill-
nesses, like ALS, but the economic strain on 
our nonprofits across the country. Although 
the pandemic has changed the way Josh and 
the Iowa ALS provide help, they still make 
sure they are providing the same level of care 
for Iowans and their families. Josh credits his 
amazing co-workers, caring board members, 
and volunteers across the state who all work 
together and of course his wife, Kate, and 
their twin daughters Lydia and Taylor—who 
would like the record to show they are 12 and 
a half. ‘‘We are Iowa’’ he said, explaining that 
Iowans pitch in and help each other in times 
of need. It is Josh’s love for his fellow Iowans, 
passion for change, and service to our com-
munity that I am proud to name him Iowan of 
the Week.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JULIO 
AUGUST SANDINO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Julio August Sandino, 
who passed away on November 17, 2020. 
Julio was a longtime Merced County resident 
and United States Army veteran. 
Julio was born on September 29, 1933 in 
Merced, California to Guido Sr. and Carola 
Sandino, both Italian immigrants. He was the 
youngest of three boys. Growing up on a farm, 
Julio understood the value of hard work and 
the art of growing the best onions and toma-
toes. After being a four-year basketball varsity 
player for Merced High School, setting several 
school scoring records and receiving the best 
student award in woodshop, Julio joined the 
United States Army from 1953 to 1955 as a 
corporal stationed in Germany during the Cold 
War. During that time, he made the regimental 
basketball team. 
Julio returned home after serving honorably 
in the Army and met the love of his life, Rita 
Albiani, a daughter of Italian immigrants from 
Livingston, California. In 1956, they were mar-
ried at Our Lady of Mercy Church in Merced 
and started a family of their own. Julio started 
his own business, Sandino’s Custom Cabinet 
Shop, which he owned for 40 years until re-
tirement, and Rita worked as an accountant 
and managed medical offices. 
Julio started his love of woodwork on his 
family’s farm and converted animal and stor-
age sheds into his cabinet shop. He made 
beautiful pieces of cabinet work that was well- 
known in Merced County, Tahoe, San Fran-
cisco, and Yosemite. During his career, Julio

later became a general contractor and built 
many beautiful homes in Merced, even build-
ing his family’s custom homes. 
Family was Julio’s biggest joy in life. Every 
Sunday he would spend time with his ex-
tended family over Italian dishes that featured 
his award-winning tomatoes, garlic, and on-
ions, prepared by his wife and mother. He 
would go mushroom hunting with his brother 
Guido, fishing with his friends, loved teaching 
basketball to his children, spending time with 
his lodge brothers, and winning bocce tour-
naments. 
Julio was preceded in death by parents, old-
est brother August who was killed in combat 
during World War II, and his best friend and 
older brother, Guido Jr. 
Julio is survived by his loving wife of 64 
years, Rita, daughter Julie Sandino and hus-
band Rusty Areias; grandchildren Alexis and 
Austin; and son David Sandino and wife 
Georgina Valencia. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Julio August 
Sandino. His service in the Cold War, and 
love for his family and community will be re-
membered by those who had the pleasure of 
knowing him. I join his family and friends in 
honoring his great life.

2020 ELECTION IRREGULARITIES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as a former Election Commissioner, 
not as a Member of Congress, I am disgusted 
of the irregularities of the 2020 election. The 
first duty of a commissioner is fairness and 
honesty, not facilitating fraud as has sadly so 
clearly occurred in 2020. 
The failure to verify signatures, the omission 
of witnesses, the interruption of counting be-
fore completion, the denial of poll watchers for 
access to fully observe, the extension of bal-
lots received beyond Election Day, registration 
of illegal aliens, the mailing of mass ballots re-
quested or not, with all irregularities being 
uncontrovented, this is an open invitation of 
fraud with financing of hundreds of millions of 
dollars by elitist tech billionaires to pay for ‘‘get 
out the vote’’ for Democrats to maintain tech 
monopolies. 
I was grateful to join my colleagues from 
South Carolina, JEFF
DUNCAN
of Laurens, 
RALPH NORMAN of Rock Hill, TOM RICE of Myr-
tle Beach, and WILLIAM TIMMONS of Greenville, 
as ‘‘friends of the court’’ along with 121 addi-
tional Members of Congress to support the 
legal challenge to the election irregularities. 
In addition, Attorney General Alan Wilson of 
South Carolina courageously joined the suit 
with 16 additional states, but unfortunately the 
Supreme Court declined to accept the chal-
lenge. An excellent review of the Attorney 
General’s actions was published December 
15, 2020, in The Post and Courier of Charles-
ton. 
WHY I JOINED THE LAWSUIT 
A number of critics have attacked South 
Carolina’s involvement in the election law-
suit that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Now that the court has decided not to hear 
the suit, I would like to address the attacks, 
but first I will explain my position with a 
simple analogy. 
Consider an example where two football 
teams are playing for the national cham-
pionship, and in the final seconds of the 
game one team scores the game-winning 
touchdown. As the winning team celebrates, 
a camera angle of the touchdown shows that 
the player who ran the ball into the end zone 
might have stepped out of bounds before 
crossing the goal line. 
The coach of the presumptive losing team 
challenges the last play by asking the ref-
eree for a review. The reason for this chal-
lenge is because if it is determined that the 
player stepped out of bounds before scoring, 
then the rules were violated and the touch-
down is not legitimate. The coach has a duty 
to exhaust all remedies available to him; 
otherwise, he is not doing his job. 
Just like football, elections have rules that 
must be followed to the letter before a win-
ner can be declared. In this particular case, 
the rules for federal elections are given to us 
in the U.S. Constitution, and I interpret 
those rules to say basically that laws dic-
tating the time, location and manner of elec-
tions should be determined by state legisla-
tures and no one else. 
A number of state officials from other 
states—well-intentioned or not—unilaterally 
rewrote the laws through executive fiat, 
which is, arguably, a violation of the ‘‘elec-
tors clause’’ of the Constitution. For exam-
ple, in one state the legislature passed a law 
that said ballots must be received post-
marked by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The court 
in that state, which is a non-legislative 
body, extended the deadline by three days 
and waived the requirement for a postmark 
on the mail-in ballot. 
I believe the Constitution only grants the 
state legislature with the legal authority to 
change the deadline and postmark require-
ments, not another state official. This raises 
the question, in this particular example, of 
whether the ballots received days after the 
election with no postmark are in fact legal 
votes and, if they are not legal votes, should 
we still count them? Other examples can be 
cited, but either way, this is analogous to a 
player allegedly stepping out of bounds. 
Normally I would never intervene in an-
other state’s business, nor should I. However, 
presidential elections are national elections 
where oftentimes the outcome is determined 
by only a few states. If state officials were to 
unilaterally change their state law and those 
changes might have affected the outcome of 
the national election, then the voters of all 
the other states who voted for the other can-
didate would be disenfranchised. 
There is an appellate process in football 
that allows a coach to challenge the results 
of a play when that coach believes the other 
team may have violated the rules. The ref-
eree reviews the play and either agrees with 
the challenge or disagrees with the chal-
lenge. The losing team had the opportunity 
through that process to exercise its right to 
challenge. This process is what legitimizes 
the final results of the game. 
In this case, the Supreme Court was our 
referee, and there was an allegation that a 
constitutional violation had occurred. The 
process for choosing our president allows the 
states the opportunity to challenge a ques-
tionable result. The Supreme Court had the 
authority to decline to hear the lawsuit, but 
we had the right to present this important 
issue. Even though the Supreme Court re-
jected the lawsuit, moving forward we should 
not allow election officials to unilaterally 
change election laws. Such changes severely 
diminish the integrity of elections. 
It’s amazing that so many have criticized 
the states for daring to raise this question 
before the court on behalf of so many who 
believe the rules have been violated. I won-
der if this righteous indignation would be as 
loud if the roles were reversed. History sug-
gests that it would not.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DR. 
JOSEPH I. CASTRO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate a great leader and friend, Dr. Jo-
seph I. Castro, President of California State 
University, Fresno (Fresno State) for being ap-
pointed as the eighth chancellor to lead the 
California State University System. 
Dr. Castro was born in the city of Hanford 
in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He is 
a grandson of immigrants and farmworkers 
from Mexico, son of a single mother and the 
first in his family to graduate from a four-year 
institution. He earned his bachelor’s degree in 
Political Science and a master’s in public pol-
icy from the University of California, Berkeley, 
and a Ph.D. in higher education policy and 
leadership from Stanford University. 
For 23 years, Dr. Castro has worked in the 
University of California system. He was Vice 
Chancellor of Student Academic Affairs at Uni-
versity of California San Francisco. Castro led 
UCSF programs that specialized in academic 
and health care needs of its talented students. 
He was part of the founding staff at University 
of California, Merced and held key leadership 
positions at three other UC campuses includ-
ing Berkeley, Davis and Santa Barbara. 
Mr. Castro currently serves as the President 
of the California State University, Fresno since 
2013. Under his leadership, the university has 
become a national leader in recruiting, sup-
porting and graduating students from diverse 
backgrounds. The university has also received 
national recognition from various publications, 
such as the Washington Monthly and U.S. 
News and World Report. 
Dr. Castro’s leadership and hard work has 
been recognized by various organizations. He 
was named CSU President of the Year by the 
California State Student Association, City of 
Fresno District 4 Man of the Year and a recipi-
ent of the Ohtli award, the highest honor

granted by the Government of Mexico to lead-
ers in the United States. 
Dr. Castro has made a difference in the 
lives of many students at Fresno State and 
across California. He has paved the way for 
many students and has inspired others to 
make a difference in higher education and in 
their communities. Dr. Castro is the first Cali-
fornia native and first Mexican-American to be 
appointed to oversee the 23-campus university 
system, which is the largest in the nation. He 
will begin his duties as chancellor on Jan. 4, 
2021. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Chancellor-Select, Dr. Jo-
seph I. Castro. We also congratulate his family 
including his wife, Mary and three children, 
Isaac, Lauren and Jess. Although his pres-
ence will be missed at Fresno State, I look for-
ward to seeing the success of the CSU sys-
tem under his leadership.
