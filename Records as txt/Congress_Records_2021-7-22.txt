Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 22, 2021 
No. 129 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious and loving God, hear our 
prayers. We come to You in faith hop-
ing that You would receive our con-
cerns, spoken and unspoken, personal 
and professional. From the depth of 
Your infinite mercy, listen to us, and 
bless all that troubles us. 
Then enable us to listen for Your re-
sponse. In a time when so much noise 
and messaging is coming from every di-
rection, words of counsel and criticism, 
voices of guile and guidance, give us 
reason to pause and listen for Your 
word as You speak into our lives. 
Give us ears to hear and spirits will-
ing not just to hear but to put Your 
counsel into practice, that this House 
would be built on the foundation You 
have established. 
And in our dealings with one an-
other, in our interactions with the peo-
ple who depend on our integrity and 
faithfulness, may we be quick to listen, 
slow to speak, and slow to become 
angry. 
With humility, patience, and forbear-
ance, may we reveal Your righteous-
ness this day. 
For it is in Your saving name we 
pray. 
Amen.

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. GROTHMAN led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
200 DAYS OF DELIVERING FOR THE 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the child 
tax credit’s checks arriving to families 
in my district and across the country. 
It has been 200 days of this Congress 
and 200 days of House Democrats deliv-
ering for the people. 
Last week, thanks to the American 
Rescue Plan, child tax credit monthly 
payments began arriving to roughly 39 
million households and covering al-
most 90 percent of children nationwide. 
In my district the child tax credit 
will benefit almost 95 percent of our 
children. 
In Texas, the families of nearly six 
million children got their checks total-
ing $1.5 billion in aid. 
Unfortunately, about 46,600 children 
in the Houston area still have not re-
ceived a check. 
The good news is this: Nonfilers can 
still apply on the IRS portal. Care-
givers just need their Social Security 
number or their ITIN number. And it is 
very important to remember that these 
benefits will not affect SNAP, Med-
icaid, SSI, or any other public assist-
ance program. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful and 
sincerely believe that we can build 
back better, and our children’s future 
can be assured. 
f 
ACTIONS AND RESULTS SPEAK 
LOUDER THAN WORDS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, actions 
and results speak louder than words. 
In the months since President Biden 
first called for unity and bipartisan co-
operation, the President’s and Speak-
er’s reckless tax-and-spend policies 
have hurt middle-class families and 
small businesses. These are the very 
people they profess to want to help the 
most. 
For the third straight month, the 
cost of living in America has continued 
to increase, the highest rate of infla-
tion we have witnessed since 2008. 
Compared to last year, gas prices are 
up 45 percent. Food prices have in-
creased 21⁄2 percent. The price of an 
automobile is up 45 percent for a used 
car. Americans know they are paying 
more for what they need to live every 
day while their paychecks have de-
creased by almost 2 percent. 
Americans are spending more and 
getting less. This inflation is a hidden 
tax and a pay cut on every American 
family. And the effects of these are felt 
hardest by our senior citizens and peo-
ple living on fixed incomes. 
The cost-of-living adjustment for So-
cial Security this year was barely 1 
percent, but rising consumer prices 
have outpaced that increase by more 
than four times.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3806 
July 22, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember an Inland Empire 
resident and an excellent public serv-
ant, Lois Carson. 
Lois was a beloved member of my 
community and a passionate advocate 
for childcare, education, and welfare 
reform. 
Lois served as the president of the 
San Bernardino Community College 
District Board of Trustees while I 
served on the Riverside Community 
College District Board of Trustees. I 
have fond memories of working with 
her at trustee conferences where we 
would collaborate on improving the 
lives of Inland Empire students. 
During her 30 years as the executive 
director of Community Action Partner-
ship of Riverside County, Lois provided 
services 
for 
low-income 
residents. 
Under her leadership the agency ran 
successfully and received the first pub-
lic sector Community Action Agency 
award for excellence in 2005. 
The Inland Empire was fortunate to 
benefit from Lois Carson’s many tal-
ents, and I am honored to have known 
her and believe that her legacy will 
live on in the many lives she touched. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WALTER 
STRAKA 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life of Private 
Walter Straka. 
At 17, Walter lied about his age to 
serve in the Army National Guard. In 
1941, his unit, the 194th Tank Bat-
talion, arrived in the Philippines just 
months before the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. 
After the fall of Bataan in 1942, Wal-
ter and his comrades were forced on a 
brutal 65-mile trek now known as the 
Bataan Death March. 
During the march, Walter was forced 
to walk in intense heat and subjected 
to appalling abuse at the hands of the 
Japanese army. 
By Walter’s own account, he should 
have been dead a thousand times, but 
Walter not only survived this 6-day 
march, he also survived 3 years as a 
prisoner of war before returning home 
to Brainerd, Minnesota. 
Once home, Walter ran a successful 
business, raised a family, and was an 
active member in his community. 
Walter Straka died this year at the 
age of 101. With his passing, the State 
of Minnesota said good-bye to its last 
survivor of the Bataan Death March. 
Private Walter Straka is an Amer-
ican hero whose unforgettable story 
has inspired me and so many others. 
Our Nation is stronger because of his 
exceptional service and courage. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST ACT 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, last week 
marked a year since our country lost a 
giant and a friend to all, John Lewis. 
Republicans and Democrats of both 
Chambers rightfully used our platforms 
to memorialize a man who gave so 
much, and as many say, he was the 
conscience of our caucus. 
Mr. Lewis nearly lost his life at the 
age of 25 to those on the other side of 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in March of 
1965 as he nonviolently protested voter 
suppression laws. 
And he dedicated the rest of his life 
to justice, equality, and protecting the 
right to vote. 
Mr. Speaker, 66 years later we are 
again on that bridge. Seventeen States 
have passed 28 laws to make it more 
difficult to exercise our constitutional 
right to vote. 
We must act. 
So I say to my colleagues that stand 
in the way of the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act, would you also have stood 
on the other side of that bridge? 
Mr. Lewis understood we could not 
wait for those on the other side of the 
bridge to join us. We must secure, pro-
tect, and expand the right to vote for 
all Americans to truly honor Mr. 
Lewis’ life, legacy, and our democracy. 
f 
ADDRESSING THE CUBA CRISIS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
now address the Cuban crisis just south 
of our border. 
Cuba is, of course, a very progressive 
Marxist state. The government runs 
the economy with all the restrictions 
of freedom; that means there is no free-
dom of press. 
The State Department International 
Religious Freedom Report shows nu-
merous violations of freedom of reli-
gion as believers in God are harassed. 
There is no freedom of movement. And 
now with protests, people are dis-
appearing. 
How does the United States respond? 
There was a Free Cuba mural put up in 
Washington, D.C., and the mayor of our 
Nation’s capital responded by saying 
that it was said in the past that Cuba 
has an education system we should 
learn from, and the mural disappeared. 
I beg President Biden to do what he 
can to restore internet service so the 
people in Cuba can communicate with 
each other. Please don’t lift the embar-
go. And above all, provide a little bit of 
moral leadership and show that you are 
opposed to the Marxist cabal to the 
rest of the world.

RECOGNIZING 
OLYMPIANS 
FROM 
NORTH 
CAROLINA 
AGRICUL-
TURAL AND TECHNICAL STATE 
UNIVERSITY 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olym-
pics, to recognize the Olympians from 
North Carolina Agricultural and Tech-
nical State University, the largest 
HBCU in the Nation, located in my dis-
trict in Greensboro, North Carolina. 
It gives me great pride to recognize 
Trevor Stewart and Randolph Ross, Jr., 
who will represent the United States 
on the track and field team. 
Randolph Ross, Jr., a sophomore, is 
competing in the men’s 400-meter and 
the 
4x400-meter 
relay, 
and 
Trevor 
Stewart, a senior, will compete in the 
men’s 4x400-meter relay. 
Two other Aggie runners will com-
pete in the Olympic track and field 
events. Akeem Sirleaf will compete for 
Liberia, and Daniel Stokes will com-
pete for Mexico. 
With all four of these young men 
qualifying, the entire Aggie 4x400- 
meter relay team will run in the Olym-
pics. 
I also recognize NC A&T director of 
track and field programs, Duane Ross. 
Coach Ross’ leadership has propelled 
his team forward to success. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the ath-
letes and coach on this tremendous 
achievement. On behalf of North Caro-
lina’s Sixth District, I am sending 
them the best of luck in Tokyo. Go, 
Aggies. 
f 
CELEBRATING PURPLE HEART 
HOMES 
(Mr. MCHENRY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCHENRY. Today, the Purple 
Heart Homes nonprofit is celebrating 
their 750th completed project. 
Headquartered in Statesville, North 
Carolina, Purple Heart Homes is a non-
profit founded by combat-wounded vet-
erans to help aging and service-con-
nected disabled veterans in their hous-
ing needs. 
Founded in 2008 by John Gallina and 
the late Dale Beatty, they established 
Purple Heart Homes with a mission to 
help those that have given so much to 
our Nation. 
Whether it is building ramps or con-
structing new homes, they step in to 
fill the void in programs designed to 
serve our deserving veterans. 
I congratulate John and his diverse 
team on their incredible accomplish-
ments to serve our heroes. 
I recently met with John and his 
team, and while they have unique 
backgrounds that they bring to this 
mission, they are all united by one 
thing: They are called to serve. 
I congratulate John and his team, 
and I also congratulate Purple Heart 
Homes.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, after 
20 years, the United States is winding 
down its involvement in a long, pro-
tracted war in Afghanistan, but we 
have an obligation to the men and 
women who have served with Allied 
forces who put themselves at risk, es-
pecially the interpreters. 
I am proud of the fact that the first 
2,500 of those people will be, in fact, lo-
cated in Virginia for processing as we 
try to protect them and their families 
for their service in a noble cause. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting 
for the bill that will be coming up later 
this morning, and I thank Mr. CROW, 
particularly, for his leadership in this 
matter. 
f 
INCREASING INFLATION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to see President Biden has ac-
knowledged that we are having a lot of 
inflation right now in this country af-
fecting prices for everybody. He even 
went so far as to tell some restaurant 
owners that you are going to be in a 
bind for a while because it is going to 
still be hard to get workers. 
When people are paid not to show up 
because of overgenerous benefits, all 
our small businesses will continue to 
be in a bind. When you pay people not 
to work, you get inflation. So for a few 
maybe getting a wage increase because 
the restaurants are in a bind, every-
body receives higher prices. Prices are 
up, we know, on food, on fuel, lumber, 
many things. This is what happens 
when the government spends too much, 
puts too much money into the econ-
omy all based on debt. 
So what are we going to do about 
that? Are we going to set a course here 
to put people back in business, or do we 
want to have, like we saw just this last 
month, another 5.4 percent of inflation, 
which is really a tax on every Amer-
ican. 
f 
AVERTING LOSS OF LIFE AND IN-
JURY BY EXPEDITING SIVS ACT

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,

NADLER) and the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) each will con-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 3985. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3985, the Averting 
Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting 
SIVs Act of 2021, or the ALLIES Act, 
makes essential changes to the Afghan 
special immigrant visa program to en-
sure that the lives of those who served 
faithfully alongside American troops in 
Afghanistan are protected. 
The special immigrant visa program 
allows those individuals who worked 
for or on behalf of the U.S. Government 
in Afghanistan, or for the NATO Inter-
national Security Assistance Force in 
support of the American mission, to 
seek lawful permanent residence in the 
United States. 
To be eligible, applicants must estab-
lish qualifying employment in Afghani-
stan for 2 years, receive approval from 
the Chief of Mission, and undergo rig-
orous background checks and national 
security vetting, a process that, on av-
erage, takes 3 years. 
Our 20-year mission in Afghanistan 
will formally come to an end in just a 
few short weeks. Each day that we con-
tinue to draw down our military pres-
ence in Afghanistan, threats to the 
lives of Afghans who supported our 
cause are increasing exponentially. 
The Biden administration has com-
mitted to relocating certain applicants

July 22, 2021 
to a third country. Some who have 
passed the national security vetting 
process will be transferred to the 
United States to complete visa proc-
essing. 
These evacuations, which are sched-
uled to begin at the end of this month, 
are a critical component of our with-
drawal strategy. But evacuations alone 
are not enough. Congress must do our 
part to protect those whose lives are at 
risk because of their support and serv-
ice to our Nation. 
First and foremost, we must ensure 
that enough visas are available for eli-
gible applicants. H.R. 3985 increases the 
number of visas that may be issued to 
qualifying Afghans by 8,000, which 
would ensure that all qualified appli-
cants who are currently undergoing 
processing can immediately receive a 
visa if they are approved. 
Second, we must streamline visa 
processing to the greatest extent pos-
sible, without compromising national 
security or program integrity. 
H.R. 3985 does this by reducing dupli-
cative paperwork requirements and 
modifying the requirement that appli-
cants prove the existence of an ongoing 
serious threat to their lives; to reflect 
the fact that Afghans who worked in 
support of the U.S. mission now face an 
obvious threat as a direct result of 
their work. 
Third, the bill strengthens protec-
tions for certain groups of Afghan na-
tionals, including surviving spouses, 
and children of deceased principal ap-
plicants, 
individuals 
employed 
by 
NATO in support of the U.S. mission, 
and individuals whose work was funded 
by a U.S. Government cooperative 
agreement or grant. 
Collectively, these changes will en-
sure that no one whose lives are at risk 
because of their support to the Amer-
ican mission are abandoned or forced 
to wait for Congress to act to authorize 
more visas. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor 
of this important bill. I thank Rep-
resentative CROW for championing the 
cause of our Afghan allies and working 
across the aisle to build consensus and 
support for this legislation. We must 
keep our promises to these brave men 
and women. Their lives depend on it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support H.R. 3985, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is the culmina-
tion of 20 years of policy failures in Af-
ghanistan, and it comes at the same 
time that our southern border has been 
recklessly opened to the world. This 
measure’s only redeeming feature is 
that the alternative is even worse. 
Let’s begin with the debacle occur-
ring on what, until January 20, was our 
southern border; finally secured by 
President Trump’s policies. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden 
reversed 
those 
policies. 
He 
stopped the ‘‘remain in Mexico’’ proto-
cols that required asylum claimants to 
remain there while their claims could 
be adjudicated. He stopped all con-
struction on the nearly completed bor-
der wall, leaving construction gaps 
that make it all but useless. And he or-
dered our enforcement agencies not to 
faithfully execute the law. 
The result is that over a million for-
eign nationals have illegally entered 
our country this year, with a projec-
tion of 2 million by the end of the year. 
Now, that is the entire population of 
Wyoming, Alaska, and Vermont com-
bined. And the Gallup organization 
warns that based on its polling, there 
are 42 million people just in Latin 
America and the Caribbean who intend 
to follow. And this occurs at the same 
time that 20 years of failed policy in 
Afghanistan is culminating. 
The attack on September 11, 2001, 
was our generation’s Pearl Harbor. It 
was conducted by al-Qaida, which was 
acting as an agency of the Taliban gov-
ernment of Afghanistan, which gave it 
support and protection. 
Now, the day after the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, Congress pledged the en-
tire resources of the country to the war 
and the President pledged to win 
through to ‘‘absolute victory.’’ Days 
after the attack on New York and 
Washington on September 11, Congress 
voted a tepid Authorization for the Use 
of Military Force—whatever that is— 
and the President told us to go shop-
ping. 
For 20 years, we dithered, twiddled, 
postured, hesitated. We attacked Iraq, 
that had nothing to do with 9/11, and 
put a lot of brave troops in harm’s way 
without giving them the support that 
they needed and without our leaders 
ever having a clear objective, much 
less any will to win. 
You know, it was from that very po-
dium in this Chamber that General 
Douglas MacArthur warned that in war 
there is no substitute for victory. That 
is a lesson our leaders have failed to 
learn time and again. So this debacle is 
now coming to its sad, shameful, and 
sorry conclusion. 
The Taliban again threatened to 
seize this ill-fated country, imperiling 
the thousands of Afghans who assisted 
our troops in various ways. To encour-
age their help, we passed the Afghan 
Allies Protection Act of 2009, which 
created a special immigrant visa, or 
green card program, for Afghan nation-
als who worked with the United States 
Government for at least a year, and 
who face retribution from the Taliban. 
This program also provides green cards 
to their spouses and their children. 
Now, during the 20 years that our 
troops have been in Afghanistan, tens 
of thousands of Afghans have worked 
for or on behalf of the U.S. Government 
in one capacity or another, and to date, 
over 15,500 green cards have already 
been issued to the principal applicants. 
And then additionally, for each prin-
cipal applicant, an average of 3.5 green 
cards have been issued to spouses and 
children. That is about 70,000 that we 
have already taken in. That is a city 
the size of Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
But many more are still there. 
So we have before us H.R. 3985, the 
ALLIES Act. It makes changes to the 
Afghan special immigrant visa pro-
gram to accommodate the accelerated 
withdrawal that the President has or-
dered. 
The emergency created by this order 
means that we will not be adequately 
vetting arrivals under this program. 
Those already admitted have had to 
meet eligibility requirements. They 
have had to undergo security and back-
ground checks. If we had been able to 
develop this legislation the old-fash-
ioned way, through real face-to-face 
meetings and good-faith discussions, I 
think we could have produced a process 
that protected both the American peo-
ple and the Afghan families who sided 
with our government. But alas, that 
was not to be under this majority. 
Instead, H.R. 3985 authorizes 8,000 
more green cards on top of the 10,000 
authorized but still unclaimed. Now, 
given that 15,500 principal green cards 
have been processed over the 20-year 
life of this program, the odds of proc-
essing a like number in a matter of 
months is pretty slim; unless, of 
course, the administration cuts proc-
essing and vetting corners, which I 
think is a given. 
H.R. 3985 also increases the eligi-
bility pool for the Afghan special im-
migration visa program in two ways. 
First, it removes the requirement 
that Afghan nationals who worked 
with the U.S. coalition forces must 
have performed ‘‘sensitive and trusted’’ 
activities for U.S. personnel. This pro-
vision was added several years ago with 
the understanding that there must be 
limits on the number of people who 
come to the U.S., and in an attempt to 
ensure that the limited number of 
green cards available actually go to 
those Afghan nationals who are most 
in danger. 
Now, we have asked the administra-
tion how many individuals may be eli-
gible once this language is removed 
from the statute. Their answer? They 
don’t know. And they don’t care. 
Second, this bill extends program eli-
gibility to Afghans whose employers 
received grant funding from the U.S. 
Government or were in cooperative 
agreements with the U.S. Government 
and who ‘‘contributed to the United 
States mission in Afghanistan.’’ 
Well, I am concerned that we do not 
know exactly what can be considered 
as contributing to the United States 
mission in Afghanistan or how many 
people to whom this could apply. 
The bill also eliminates the require-
ment that an applicant has experienced 
an ongoing, serious threat as a con-
sequence of his or her qualifying em-
ployment. This requirement is one of 
the main reasons for the creation of 
the program; to help ensure the safety 
of those in danger because of working 
with the U.S. 
This means that among the worthy 
asylum seekers, we are likely to see

those without merit, or worse, those 
who seek to do our country harm, be-
cause the vetting process is effectively 
abandoned by this bill. And this comes 
at a time when the asylum process is 
being made a mockery by thousands of 
meritless claims a day showing up on 
our southern border and being admit-
ted into our country. 
I wish we could have had an honest 
and open discussion about the wisdom 
of eliminating this requirement in 
committee. Unfortunately, the Demo-
crats chose to bypass the committee 
process. But with the American with-
drawal fast approaching, we are left 
with this deeply flawed bill on the one 
hand, or the very real prospect of 
watching Afghan patriots being hunted 
down and seeing them and their fami-
lies hung by construction cranes. So I 
will support this bill as the least bad 
option that the Democrats have left us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 0930 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW), the 
sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, the ALLIES 
Act is a chance for Congress to ensure 
that America honors its promise to our 
Afghan partners and friends. 
The phrase ‘‘life and death’’ gets 
tossed around in this Chamber, but this 
bill is truly that for thousands of our 
Afghan friends. The Taliban is intent 
on hunting down and killing Afghans 
that served alongside Americans for 
the past 20 years. 
Some Members of this body, includ-
ing me, may not be here today without 
the service and sacrifice of Afghans 
who answered the call to serve shoul-
der to shoulder with us. Those Afghans 
knew the risk that their service posed 
to them and their families, yet they 
signed up to help because they believed 
we would have their back. 
They have already demonstrated un-
wavering courage and loyalty by work-
ing alongside us. They have dem-
onstrated their commitment to Amer-
ica, and they have earned a path to 
safety. 
The U.S. combat mission in Afghani-
stan will come to an end in a matter of 
weeks. At the same time, the threat to 
our Afghan partners who served along-
side men and women is increasing dras-
tically every single day. 
Simply put, we are running out of 
time. They are running out of time. We 
must streamline the Afghan Special 
Immigrant Visa process and increase 
the number of visas to match the pipe-
line of applicants. The ALLIES Act 
does just that. 
The ALLIES Act removes several ad-
ministrative barriers to expedite visa 
processing, and it makes these changes 
without weakening the important secu-
rity vetting of applicants. The bill al-
lows family members of deceased SIV 
applicants to continue through the 
process if the applicant is killed before 
visa approval. 
The bill clarifies that Afghans who 
worked to benefit the U.S. mission 
under 
federally 
funded 
cooperative 
agreements and grants also qualify for 
the program. This includes Afghans 
who 
performed 
critical 
democracy, 
human rights, and governance work on 
behalf of the U.S. 
Lastly, the ALLIES Act raises the 
visa cap by 8,000 visas to meet the cur-
rent number of applicants. 
Before I close, let me thank the Hon-
oring Our Promises Working Group, a 
bipartisan group; the Biden adminis-
tration; Leader HOYER; and the Judici-
ary Committee for their partnership in 
crafting this bill and getting us to the 
vote today. 
This is personal to any of us who 
served with the men and women who 
will be saved by this bill. But it is also 
a moral and national security issue for 
America. 
It is a moral issue because the Amer-
ican handshake must matter. We must 
be a country that honors our promises 
if we are to be a beacon of hope and de-
mocracy for the world. 
It is a national security issue because 
America is strong, not just because we 
have aircraft carriers and fighters and 
bombers, but because we have friends 
and allies. We don’t go it alone. We 
face many threats, and we will con-
tinue to in the future, and we will need 
friends to help us face those threats. If 
we turn our back on the Afghans who 
served with us for the last two decades, 
it is going to be awfully hard to find fu-
ture friends. 
Mr. Speaker, this is our chance to do 
the right thing. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the ALLIES Act. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ), a veteran of the 
Afghanistan war. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, for me, as 
well, this is a very personal endeavor 
and a very personal bill. 
Speaking as a combat veteran of the 
Afghan war, the Afghans supporting 
our troops weren’t just interpreters; 
they became our brothers and our sis-
ters on the battlefield. We depended on 
each other for survival. 
They fought with us; they bled with 
us; and in many cases, they died with 
us, all for the dream of a better Af-
ghanistan, for a safer world, for pros-
perity for their families, and for rip-
ping out the dangerous and sick ex-
tremist ideology that has tormented 
their country, taken their society 
backward, and threatened the United 
States of America. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion’s reckless withdrawal is allowing 
the Taliban to once again seize control 
of Afghanistan. 
The urgency of the situation on the 
ground is not hyperbole. Just yester-
day, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
said the Taliban appears to have stra-
tegic momentum in their offensive, and 
I hope that this Congress can continue 
supporting the Afghan security forces 
to help them halt that advance and, in 
the wake of it, al-Qaida’s and ISIS’ in-
evitable rise. 
No one is safe from the Taliban re-
prisal. We have seen in recent weeks 
the mass execution of surrendering Af-
ghan security forces and the Afghan in-
terpreters who worked with our troops 
that are now at the top of the Taliban’s 
target list. 
The United States made a commit-
ment to our allies in this conflict, and 
these individuals have lived up to their 
end of the bargain. Now, we have an ob-
ligation to honor our promises to 
them. 
According to the State Department, 
the average processing time for an SIV 
applicant is over 700 days. This is unac-
ceptable, given the urgency. 
I want to be clear. The legislation be-
fore us, which I strongly support, does 
not diminish or circumvent the screen-
ing process. Trust me, before these men 
and women were allowed to work with 
our units, they were heavily vetted, 
and that is before this 700-day process 
that they are now going through. 
I support increasing the number of 
Special Immigrant Visas by 8,000. I 
support streamlining this process. And 
if it comes to it, I support taking care 
of the families of those who didn’t 
make it back, like one of my inter-
preters, who we called Spartacus, who 
was found with American documenta-
tion on him and taken back to his vil-
lage and beheaded along with members 
of his family to send a message. 
It is notable, Mr. Speaker, that, in 
1975, then-Senator Biden did not sup-
port the evacuation of our South Viet-
namese allies. I hope now-President 
Biden will erase that sin. 
It is not just a moral obligation. It is 
a national security obligation because 
when our soldiers have to go back to 
deal with a rising al-Qaida, which I 
sadly predict they will have to, we will 
need local allies once again. 
We are sending a message right now 
by our conduct. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this critical legisla-
tion and ask the Senate to swiftly pass 
it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 23 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Cali-
fornia has 191⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this bill. As has been 
mentioned, it makes key changes in 
the Afghan Allies Protection Act to en-
sure that the Special Immigrant Visa 
program, which is part of current law, 
works as Congress intended to protect 
the lives of Afghan nationals who 
served honorably alongside U.S. troops 
in Afghanistan. 
For the past several years, many of 
us have expressed grave concerns about 
the challenges our allies face in navi-
gating the Special Immigrant Visa 
process. It currently takes an average

of 3 years to complete the process, 
which includes numerous forms, appli-
cations, detailed documentary require-
ments, and lengthy criminal back-
ground and national security checks. 
This bill makes important changes to 
streamline the application without 
compromising the national security in-
terests or the integrity of the program. 
Now, I think back to when we voted 
after 9/11, and I don’t think any of us— 
and I will speak for myself—believed 
that we were starting a 20-year war, 
the longest war in America’s history. 
During that war, Afghans stepped for-
ward to serve beside our brave mili-
tary. 
I am proud that veterans in this Con-
gress, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, have stepped forward to work to-
gether to make sure that this bill 
moves forward so that we can honor 
our commitment. 
Mr. Speaker, we are finally leaving 
Afghanistan after 20 years, our longest 
war. We have a moral obligation to en-
sure that our allies can safely and 
more quickly be removed from harm, 
so we need to stand by these brave men 
and women and pass this bill. It is in 
the national interest. 
If we can’t keep our promises to our 
allies, who is going to believe us in the 
future? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CROW from Colorado, in particular, for 
leading on this important legislation. I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3985, 
the ALLIES Act. 
For almost two decades, American 
troops have fought the war on terror in 
Afghanistan. Over the course of the 
war, thousands of native Afghans put 
their lives on the line to support our 
American servicemembers. They served 
as translators, guides, contractors, and 
more. Their support was critical to the 
safety of our servicemembers and the 
success of our operations. 
They showed true bravery and risked 
their lives in pursuit of an end to the 
Taliban’s regime and a free nation. 
Now, their decision to help Americans 
is seen as traitorous by the Taliban, 
and many of these Afghans and their 
families have been marked for death. 
This danger has only been com-
pounded by the Biden administration’s 
hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
No plans were originally put in place to 
help these individuals evacuate, and 
now, many face dire consequences. 
We have a moral imperative to sup-
port those who served alongside our 
men and women in uniform and cannot 
leave them behind. While the adminis-
tration has announced plans to evac-
uate some of our Afghan allies, they 
should not have been an afterthought. 
I call on the administration to expe-
ditiously process SIV applicants and 
expand their efforts to get these indi-
viduals and their families out of harm’s 
way immediately. 
In addition to those efforts, I am 
pleased the House is considering this 
critical legislation today. It expands 
and amends the Special Immigrant 
Visa program to better support our Af-
ghan allies and their families. These 
combined actions are the least we can 
do to help them for their service to us. 
Anyone who puts their life on the 
line to stand alongside American serv-
icemembers deserves not only our grat-
itude, but they deserve our protection. 
That is why I am proud to vote in favor 
of the ALLIES Act of 2021, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3985, the 
ALLIES Act of 2021. 
First, I thank the chairman for 
bringing this bill forward, and I thank 
my friend, Mr. CROW, for sponsoring 
this bill. 
Recently, 
I 
met 
with 
Combined 
Arms, a local organization that works 
with veterans and SIV recipients in 
Houston. They shared their harrowing 
stories of the sacrifices they and their 
families have made and of their fear 
that they have of being put to death. 
They also shared with me the times 
that they have been waiting to receive 
their SIVs. In some cases, they have 
waited for 10 years. This is unaccept-
able. 
I call on my colleagues to support 
this legislation so we can protect our 
allies and reform the system, but also 
to support the immediate evacuation of 
our allies in Afghanistan to U.S. soil, 
where we can ensure their safety. 
We can’t wait any longer. We need to 
act now. We need to evacuate all 18,000 
allies with pending SIV applications 
and their immediate families who are 
in danger. 
Mr. Speaker, I met with a young man 
who is now safely in Houston, but 
sadly, his father has already been mur-
dered by the Taliban. At least 300, I am 
told, have already been murdered, just 
like his father, by the Taliban. The 
more we delay, the more we put fami-
lies at risk. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to support this 
bill. We need to support an immediate 
evacuation. And we need to make sure 
that our friends who stood with us, 
that we now stand with them. 
b 0945 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from California for yielding. 
I stand here alongside my colleagues 
in solidarity that we should be stand-
ing with the Afghans who stood to-
gether with our men and women in uni-
form. There is zero question that we 
should do that, and every veteran that 
I represent in the Texas 21 District 
shares that, as we have heard here on 
this floor. 
I am supportive of that underlying 
principle, however, a self-executing 
manager’s amendment was included 
that I had concerns with. It expands 
the program to include nonprofits and 
grantees, private organizations, that 
contributed to the United States mis-
sion in Afghanistan. 
We don’t know who would be in-
cluded. We don’t know how many peo-
ple would now be eligible. 
It expands the program to individuals 
who worked for the International Secu-
rity Assistance Force without the need 
to perform sensitive and trusted activi-
ties for the United States forces. These 
people do not have to be Afghans, and 
we don’t know how many people this 
would be. It weakens the standard for 
qualification. 
Under current law, an alien has to 
verify that they have experienced or 
are experiencing an ongoing serious 
threat as a consequence of the alien’s 
employment by the United States Gov-
ernment. 
The new standard is, has asserted a 
credible basis for concern about the 
possibility of an ongoing or serious 
threat. A credible basis for concern 
about the possibility of is concerningly 
low, lower than even the credible fear 
standard of significant possibility we 
currently employ. 
The bill allows for another 8,000 prin-
cipal aliens to be granted this special 
immigrant status. We agree we want to 
try to help those principal aliens. 
There are 10,000 currently unused. That 
would be about the 18,000 number. Let’s 
also remember that we have 31⁄2 people 
come in per person on average. We have 
had about 125 to 130,000 folks come in. 
This would be about another 75 to 
80,000. That does not include dealing 
with the NGOs. 
So we are now massively expanding 
this program, which means we are 
going to be back down here at the well 
talking about new numbers and more 
expansions based on nebulous stand-
ards with respect to NGOs and private 
entities that aren’t individuals who 
worked for the United States Govern-
ment directly alongside our men and 
women in uniform. 
That is more than concerning, and it 
brings me back to my final point: We 
have got to restore regular order in 
this body. We are not amending this, 
we are not debating it in committee, 
and we did not have a hearing on the 
specific manager’s amendment that 
was added. It was just added, put on 
the floor, and put under the title of 
something 
that 
everyone 
supports, 
which means, Mr. Speaker, that you 
are put in the position of figuring out 
whether you are going to support the 
underlying matter while all these 
things are added to it which have seri-
ous concerns we should have debated in 
committee and debated and amended 
on the floor. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
in support of the ALLIES Act.

ed so eloquently, that we have a moral

obligation and a duty to take care of 
those who protected and safeguarded 
American troops in Afghanistan. 
Future allies will look at how we 
treated those who put themselves in 
harm’s way: the thousands of inter-
preters and others who aided our mis-
sion when they are asked to help us in 
other times of need. 
There is one particular group I would 
like to call special attention to: the Af-
ghan Female Tactical Platoon. This 
small group of elite Afghan women 
sought a better future for their coun-
try. They were trained by our coun-
try’s Special Forces and supported our 
special operation missions during the 
war. They gathered essential intel-
ligence and helped protect the lives of 
innocent 
civilians 
and 
American 
troops. We owe these brave women 
more than our gratitude. We owe them 
what they gave us: loyalty and protec-
tion. 
Because of their gender, they are 
marked for especially heinous retalia-
tion and punishment by the Taliban. 
Without our help they will almost cer-
tainly be raped, sold into sex traf-
ficking, tortured, or executed all be-
cause they helped the American people. 
I want to thank Representative CROW 
for his steadfast leadership on this 
critically important issue, and I urge 
my colleagues to approve this essential 
bill. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), who is the rank-
ing member of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
saying: No man left behind; no woman 
left behind. That is the commitment 
and that is a promise that we made to 
the interpreters, to our Afghan part-
ners, that we would not leave them be-
hind in the dust to be slaughtered by 
the Taliban. They have a bull’s-eye on 
their back. I have talked to them. I 
have talked to our Special Forces 
whom they protected in this 20-year 
war. They will be killed if we don’t get 
them out of there. 
Our Defense Department is on a fast 
track. 
That 
entire 
country—the 
Taliban is on the offensive—is likely 
going to fall to the Taliban. The deci-
sion to withdraw completely has been 
made, but we have to be prepared for 
the aftermath. A refugee crisis and hu-
manitarian 
crisis 
will 
occur. 
The 
women in Afghanistan will be tortured 
and will not be educated. We had a 
school of 200 women—girls—that were 
blown up. Little girls were blown up. 
That, Mr. Speaker, is the Taliban. That 
will be the same fate for our Afghan 
partners if we don’t get them out of 
there now. 
They have 700 now coming to Fort 
Lee in Virginia. I urge the administra-
tion to get the rest of them. There are 
9,000 interpreters, probably 20,000 total 
when it comes to our Afghan partners. 
I ask the President to please get them 
out before they are killed by the 
Taliban. 
Our ISR, or intelligence, surveil-
lance, and reconnaissance, capability is 
wiped out. The Bagram air base fell to 
the Afghans in a very sloppy transi-
tion, and the Taliban is going to take 
that over, too. Now we can’t see what 
China, Russia, and Iran are doing. We 
can’t see what ISIS and al-Qaida are 
doing. We are going dark, Mr. Speaker, 
because we can’t see anything on the 
ground. 
But I can tell you this: The moral ob-
ligation we have to save those whom 
we promised we would protect has to be 
fulfilled, and that is precisely what 
this bill does, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Ju-
diciary Committee for bringing this 
forward. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NADLER for offering me this 
minute and a half, and I thank him for 
his leadership for bringing this bill to 
the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
ALLIES Act. This bill will save lives 
and protect our allies. It will also 
honor our commitment to the region. 
Thousands of Afghans have served as 
interpreters, drivers, and guides to as-
sist U.S. troops. Their service and com-
mitment have been consistent over the 
20 years that now marks the longest 
U.S. war in history. 
The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa, 
or SIVs, allows people who worked for 
or on behalf of the United States Gov-
ernment to seek lawful permanent resi-
dence in the United States. But as we 
prepare to remove our troops, the 
Taliban 
continues 
to 
target 
our 
friends. The ALLIES Act of 2021 pro-
vides for an additional 8,000 SIVs to ac-
commodate everyone who currently 
could be an eligible candidate in the 
pipeline. We have an opportunity and a 
moral obligation to save the lives of 
those who served us. 
As we draw down our military pres-
ence in Afghanistan, many who served 
alongside our troops continue to face 
increased threats because of their serv-
ice to us. We must do the right thing 
by our brave allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CROW for his service and his leadership 
on this bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DUNN). 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I came to 
speak on this bill because it means a 
lot to me. My war was Vietnam, and I 
remember the end of that war. I re-
member the friends that we left behind, 
I remember the families that were torn 
apart, and it still weighs on me. 
Now I have a son who spent years in 
Afghanistan, and when he talks to me, 
he does not talk about taxes or 
healthcare. He talks about the people 
he left behind in Afghanistan and what 
we are doing for them. We cannot do 
this again. We must not do this again. 
We have to rise and bring back and re-
patriate all the people who were so im-
portant to us in combat. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you understand 
that. Please do not abandon friends of 
America again. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I, 
too, want to add my appreciation to 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee for his leadership in moving 
this bill forward and certainly to our 
friend and one who has served this Na-
tion in many ways, Congressman CROW, 
for his continued consideration of our 
friends in Afghanistan. 
As the co-chair and founder of the Af-
ghanistan Caucus, I have gone to Af-
ghanistan many, many times in the 
early years. I know the people in Af-
ghanistan truly love democracy. I 
know the women and children want 
education, and I know that in the 
midst of our decision on the longest- 
serving war, we must find that path-
way to be able to ensure democracy 
prevails, both in terms of the demo-
cratic leadership of government but 
also in the lives of the people. 
I hesitate to read this language: 
‘‘Gunfire erupts. At least a dozen men 
are seen shot to death amid cries of 
‘Allahu Akbar’, God is great. 
‘‘The victims were members of an Af-
ghan Special Forces unit: their execu-
tioners, the Taliban. The summary 
killings took place on June 16 in the 
town of Dawlat Abad in Faryab Prov-
ince, close to Afghanistan’s border 
with Turkmenistan.’’ It is, of course, a 
difficult thing to read and to under-
stand. 
But as we begin to write the demo-
cratic principles of a constitution so 
many years ago—prior to this Nation 
going to Iraq—people were interested 
and excited about their life. Women 
were elected as parliamentarians. In 
fact, they prided themselves on a num-
ber of parliamentarians who happened 
to be women. 
In the instance of that leaving Af-
ghanistan the first time, we found that 
those women, many going to their dis-
tricts, were killed. Schools for children 
that girls were in, schools that I took 
books to, were actually burned to the 
ground. 
So those who stood by us, those who 
guided our troops, those who trans-
lated for us, and those who took us into 
the villages—because many of you 
know the stories of our soldiers going 
in with money. That was the policy at 
that time—this bill specifically ac-
knowledges their leadership. 
I include in the RECORD three articles 
referencing this important issue.

July 22, 2021 
against journalists across the country have 
increased sharply since talks began between 
the Afghan government and the Taliban, 
heightening concerns about preserving free-
dom of expression and the media in any 
peace settlement. 
Human Rights Watch found that Taliban 
commanders and fighters have engaged in a 
pattern of threats, intimidation, and vio-
lence against members of the media in areas 
where the Taliban have significant influence, 
as well as in Kabul. Those making the 
threats often have an intimate knowledge of 
a journalist’s work, family, and movements 
and use this information to either compel 
them to self-censor, leave their work alto-
gether, or face violent consequences. Provin-
cial and district-level Taliban commanders 
and fighters also make oral and written 
threats against journalists beyond the areas 
they control. Journalists say that the wide-
spread nature of the threats has meant that 
no media workers feel safe. 
‘‘A wave of threats and killings has sent a 
chilling message to the Afghan media at a 
precarious moment as Afghans on all sides 
get set to negotiate free speech protections 
in a future Afghanistan,’’ said Patricia 
Gossman, associate Asia director. ‘‘By si-
lencing critics through threats and violence, 
the Taliban have undermined hopes for pre-
serving an open society in Afghanistan.’’ 
Human Rights Watch interviewed 46 mem-
bers of the Afghan media between November 
2020 and March 2021, seeking information on 
the conditions under which they work, in-
cluding threats of physical harm. Those 
interviewed 
included 
42 
journalists 
in 
Badghis, Ghazni, Ghor, Helmand, Kabul, 
Kandahar, Khost, Wardak, and Zabul prov-
inces and four who had left Afghanistan due 
to threats. 
In a number of cases that Human Rights 
Watch documented, Taliban forces detained 
journalists for a few hours or overnight. In 
several cases they or their colleagues were 
able to contact senior Taliban officials to in-
tercede with provincial and district-level 
commanders to secure their release, indi-
cating that local commanders are able to 
take decisions to target journalists on their 
own without approval from senior Taliban 
military or political officials. 
Taliban officials at their political office in 
Doha, Qatar, have denied that their forces 
threaten the media and say that they require 
only that journalists respect Islamic values. 
But Taliban commanders throughout Af-
ghanistan have threatened journalists spe-
cifically for their reporting. The com-
manders have considerable autonomy to 
carry out punishments, including targeted 
killings. 
Women journalists, especially those ap-
pearing on television and radio, face par-
ticular threats. The recent wave of violent 
attacks has driven several prominent women 
journalists to give up their profession or 
leave Afghanistan altogether. Female re-
porters may be targeted not only for issues 
they cover but also for challenging perceived 
social norms prohibiting women from being 
in a public role and working outside the 
home. 
Journalists outside the country’s main cit-
ies are especially vulnerable to attacks be-
cause they are more exposed and lack even 
the minimal protection that a larger Afghan 
media, government, and international pres-
ence provides. However, as the fighting has 
increasingly encroached on major cities, 
these have offered decreasing protection to 
journalists seeking safety from the violence 
in their home districts. 
A journalist covering the fighting in 
Helmand province said that one of his 
sources told him the Taliban were looking 
for him and he should lie low. ‘‘The majority 
of Afghan journalists feel intimidated and 
threatened,’’ he said. ‘‘All the journalists are 
scared because everyone feels like they could 
be next.’’ 
Residents of Taliban-held areas have long 
expressed fear of retaliation if they complain 
about the way Taliban forces carry out mili-
tary operations or enforce restrictions. In a 
June 2020 report, Human Rights Watch docu-
mented severe restrictions in areas under 
Taliban control, including limits on freedom 
of expression and the media. 
The 
Taliban 
leadership 
should 
imme-
diately cease intimidation, threats, and at-
tacks against journalists and other media 
workers, Human Rights Watch said. They 
should urgently provide clear, public direc-
tives to all Taliban members to end all forms 
of violence against journalists and other 
media workers, and intimidation, harass-
ment, and punishment of Afghans who have 
criticized Taliban policies. The Taliban lead-
ership should also explicitly reject violence 
against women in the media. 
The United Nations and governments sup-
porting 
the 
Intra-Afghan 
Negotiations 
should publicly press the Taliban leadership 
to adopt these recommendations, and pro-
vide increased support, including protection, 
to independent media organizations and 
journalists in Afghanistan, especially those 
facing threats. 
‘‘It’s not enough for Taliban officials in 
Doha to issue blanket denials that they’re 
targeting journalists when Taliban forces on 
the ground continue to intimidate, harass, 
and attack reporters for doing their jobs,’’ 
Gossman said. ‘‘Countries supporting the 
peace process should press for firm commit-
ments from all parties to protect journalists, 
including women, and uphold the right to 
free expression in Afghanistan.’’ 
TALIBAN THREATS TO AFGHAN MEDIA 
Although the Taliban routinely deny re-
sponsibility for attacks on journalists, the 
Afghan 
Journalists 
Security 
Committee 
(AJSC) has said: 
Since the beginning of the spike in tar-
geted killings in early November [2020], sup-
porters of the group [Taliban] have wel-
comed the killings of journalists on social 
media, calling these killings in many cases a 
religious duty. Taliban supporters accuse 
journalists of being agents of Western coun-
tries, and corrupted by Western values, 
thereby legitimizing any violence against 
journalists and the media as not only being 
permissible but a key part of their war. 
TALIBAN THREATS RELATED TO REPORTING ON 
THE WAR 
Taliban commanders and fighters have 
long targeted the media, accusing them of 
being aligned with the Afghan government 
or international military forces. If journal-
ists report unfavorably about Taliban ac-
tions or military operations, the Taliban 
often accuse them of being spies. District 
and provincial-level Taliban commanders 
have also criticized journalists for not re-
porting incidents such as civilian casualties 
from 
government 
airstrikes. 
Journalists 
have said that the role some of them play as 
influential and prominent figures in many 
communities has made them targets of the 
Taliban. By attacking them the Taliban ef-
fectively threaten all local media. A jour-
nalist in Helmand said: 
If the more prominent journalists are tar-
geted first, the other journalists, who might 
be less influential or prominent, are auto-
matically intimidated and fear for their lives 
. . . . Pro-Taliban accounts on social media 
. . . explicitly issue warnings to other jour-
nalists, along the lines of ‘‘learn something 
from the death of this journalist’’—you can 
be next. 
The effect on Afghan media has been pro-
found. The killings and threats have gen-
erated fear among journalists and media 
workers, many of whom have altered their 
work patterns in an effort to mitigate the 
danger or try to be less visible. 
Taliban pressure on the media is an appar-
ent part of an effort to shape public debate 
about the war at a time of heightened polit-
ical tensions surrounding the peace talks. 
Local journalists said Taliban commanders 
and fighters call them to complain about 
published reports, questioning why a certain 
issue was covered in a certain way. A jour-
nalist in Kandahar said: 
The Taliban warned me about reporting on 
casualties related to a suicide attack. They 
wanted me to say that a lot of people got 
killed but I just reported the attacker dying 
. . . The Taliban threatened a couple of jour-
nalists over the last couple years for not re-
porting on assassinations. They say, ’Why 
don’t you report the actual number?’ When 
we argue with them that it is the correct 
number, they threaten us. 
When one journalist reported a Taliban at-
tack on a civilian facility in Kandahar, he 
said that within minutes he received death 
threats and other warnings on his phone. The 
Taliban called him to say that they had not 
targeted civilians but a nearby government 
checkpost. The journalist said that he lives 
in fear that the Taliban might still come 
after him. Other journalists in Kandahar 
have reported being followed by Taliban 
fighters. Because of such confrontations, 
journalists often self-censor their stories. 
In Helmand, Taliban commanders targeted 
journalists who reported on military oper-
ations during a Taliban offensive in October. 
Taliban forces attacked the outskirts of 
Lashkargah city, overrunning Afghan gov-
ernment checkpoints until US airstrikes 
drove them back. In the months before he 
was killed by an improvised explosive device 
(IED) on November 11, Elyas Dayee, a jour-
nalist, had received multiple threats from 
Taliban commanders in Helmand, warning 
him to stop his reporting on their military 
operations. Another reporter covering the 
fighting said that the morning after his re-
port came out, a Taliban commander called 
and accused him of publishing reports 
against the Islamic Emirates and warned 
that he would face consequences. 
THE NATURE OF THE THREATS 
In Taliban-controlled provinces, threats 
often come from local commanders with 
knowledge of the journalist’s family, work 
habits, and movements. These commanders 
maintain individual contact with journalists 
and editors, and usually communicate these 
threats by phone or through social media. 
A radio presenter in Zabul province said 
that he and his colleagues routinely receive 
threats from the Taliban accusing them of 
giving the government publicity. The callers 
always know details about the journalists 
they call, including their jobs, family mem-
bers’ names, and often their addresses. One 
caller told him that he should either leave 
the area or work for the Taliban. When he 
refused the caller told him he should ‘‘count 
down to his death.’’ He said his relatives also 
receive these threats and are told to commu-
nicate them to him. 
In Ghazni province, reporters say that they 
have been threatened and intimidated by 
various groups and do not know who is be-
hind every attack. However, despite official 
denials from the Taliban leadership, com-
ments by Taliban commanders and fighters 
on social media have led journalists to sus-
pect that the Taliban are responsible for 
many attacks. These commanders generally 
have considerable autonomy to plan and 
carry out military operations independently. 
The Afghanistan Journalists Safety Com-
mittee said that in Ghazni province, the

Taliban had instructed the majority of the 
local media outlets that they would only be 
permitted to continue media activities if 
they followed Taliban directives. Another 
journalist in Ghazni said that the Taliban 
commanders in the province object to any 
content that is negative or critical about 
them. Journalists whose reporting is per-
ceived as favorable to the Afghan govern-
ment may immediately become a target. 
Leaving their jobs is often their only re-
course. 
On December 21, Rahmatullah Nekzad, 
head of the Ghazni journalists’ union, was fa-
tally shot as he walked from his home to a 
local mosque. Although the Taliban spokes-
man, Zabihullah Mujahid, denied that the 
group was responsible for the attack, Nekzad 
had 
been 
receiving 
threats 
from 
local 
Taliban commanders since at least 2019. He 
said in early December, that the Afghan Na-
tional Directorate of Security (NDS), the 
country’s intelligence agency, informed him 
that he and 15 other journalists in Ghazni 
were at risk of a Taliban attack. He de-
scribed the threats he received: 
I use a social media account to upload 
daily news. Some local Taliban called me to 
accuse me of running social media pages that 
post anti-Taliban news . . . Their argument 
was that every time you post something on 
your wall, these . . . are also your accounts. 
They also threatened people who commented 
on the post. 
In another case in mid-December, Taliban 
forces stopped the vehicle in which a local 
journalist was traveling. He called a contact, 
who then contacted a Taliban official. As a 
result of this intervention, the local Taliban 
released him. While he was in their custody, 
the Taliban accused him of working for the 
government’s intelligence agency and for 
‘‘foreigners.’’ 
Journalists have also been threatened for 
reporting on Taliban abuses. A radio cor-
respondent from Badghis province said that 
after he and his colleagues broadcast a re-
port about the Taliban extorting payments 
from highway drivers, the journalists began 
to receive threats: 
In addition to the radio, we have a 
Facebook page where we publish the news of 
the day. After I posted this story, one of the 
comments read: ‘‘The martyrs of the Islamic 
Emirate will soon kill the employees of this 
media station.’’ The same message came in 
[Facebook] Messenger. Since then, we report 
less news on Facebook now. Badghis’s cap-
ital is a very small city. Everyone knows 
each other and I have no doubt that they 
also know the address of our office. 
Another journalist from Badghis said that 
in November, as he was traveling from Herat 
to 
Badghis 
province, 
Taliban 
fighters 
stopped him and forced him out of his car. 
They interrogated him about whether he had 
cooperated with government security forces 
and threatened to kill him. He said that his 
family was aware that he was on the road. 
He was finally released after local and ethnic 
Taliban elders who knew them mediated his 
release. ‘‘I am still in fear and . . . shock 
from this incident,’’ he said. ‘‘Now I publish 
less news of the war. Whenever I go to a 
press conference, I am fearful and cautious. I 
only cover news from the capital now.’’ 
Local Taliban fighters have assaulted jour-
nalists who have traveled into Taliban-con-
trolled districts. A journalist from Wardak 
province said that a group of Taliban fight-
ers stopped and beat him and another re-
porter, accusing them of spying and ‘‘going 
around without the Taliban’s permission to 
take pictures, record videos, and talk to peo-
ple.’’ The journalists showed their press 
identification but were not released until 
after they called a contact, who then in-
formed senior Taliban officials, who ordered 
them released. 
Threats also come in writing. A journalist 
in Ghazni said that a letter was dropped by 
his house ordering him to meet with the 
local Taliban because his reports were not 
‘‘neutral.’’ It warned him that if he did not 
change, his death was ‘‘close.’’ After the 
warning, he left his home district and stayed 
in Kabul for a few months. Eventually he re-
turned home but avoided his office out of 
fear. 
The Taliban also send cell phone text mes-
sages to comment on media coverage, often 
chiding reporters that they should have in-
cluded the Taliban point of view. While criti-
cism of media reporting is not in itself prob-
lematic, when it comes from an armed group 
with a history of killing journalists, the 
messages are intimidating and create fear. 
‘‘Being a journalist is something that can 
put your life in danger without even doing 
anything 
specific 
to 
antagonize 
the 
Taliban,’’ one journalist in Ghazni said. 
Journalists also receive threats when they 
share their political views on social media. 
Taliban commanders also use Facebook to 
issue threats. A journalist in Ghazni said 
that shortly after he posted a government 
statement on a military offensive that re-
sulted in Taliban casualties, he received a 
message from a Taliban commander demand-
ing to speak with him: 
He told me not to listen to what [govern-
ment officials] say and ordered me to come 
see him. I had to comply. He came with his 
men in a Toyota vehicle. He threatened me 
and told me not to post anything more on 
Facebook. 
Another journalist in Ghazni had a similar 
experience after using Facebook to post his 
report on the police killing a suspected 
Taliban bomber. He received a call from a 
man who said he was with the Taliban and 
asked him why he was publishing inaccurate 
information. The man warned him that they 
would watch out for what he published and 
that he should not publish such reports any-
more. 
Local Taliban commanders issue warnings 
about radio and television stations airing 
music programs, which they consider prohib-
ited, and blame journalists for this practice. 
One journalist described the threats he re-
ceived: 
Whenever the Taliban hears about music 
on local radio channels, they immediately 
start calling you, threatening to kill you. 
They told me many times that they held 
court sessions about me, proving that I am 
guilty of broadcasting music. They threat-
ened to kill me. I left this job because of 
these threats. 
The journalist said that local Taliban offi-
cials had also told him not to broadcast elec-
tion-related news because elections were 
‘‘US-instigated.’’ He said: ‘‘I argued with 
them for a couple of months that this is not 
my personal choice but the station’s edi-
torial decision. Then the Taliban asked for 
my boss’ number and threatened him until 
he left.’’ Another Ghazni reporter said he 
had received at least six threats in which 
callers warned him of vague consequences if 
he did not remove music or make other 
changes to the programs. 
Threatening to harm relatives is a com-
mon tactic to spread fear. A journalist in 
Khost said that he received threatening calls 
from unknown numbers, some accusing him 
of working for Christians, others accusing 
him of being a foreign spy. Some specifically 
warn him that they know his relatives and 
where he lives: 
I am terrified but cannot do anything 
about it . . . One of my relatives said that I 
should leave [journalism] because he is 
scared . . . I cannot carry on with my work. 
I cannot go outside freely. A caller shared a 
lot of information about me as proof that 
they have been watching me—he told me my 
name, my father’s name, where I work, and 
the address of my house . . . after a few days, 
I got a message saying ‘‘the path you have 
chosen is not the right path, so you should 
move on from it or else we will decide what 
to do with you.’’ 
For the time being, the journalist has 
changed his phone hoping to prevent further 
threats. 
TALIBAN THREATS TO WOMEN IN THE MEDIA 
The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee 
reported that 14 women working for media 
outlets in Afghanistan were threatened or 
violently attacked in 2020. An increasing 
number of Afghan women in journalism have 
left the profession because of worsening se-
curity and threats, a trend that emerged 
after 2015 and has accelerated. 
The Islamic State of Khorasan Province 
(ISKP), an armed group affiliated with the 
Islamic State (also known as ISIS), took re-
sponsibility for killing four women journal-
ists and media workers, including Malala 
Maiwand, the first woman TV presenter for 
Enikass News, on December 10, and the 
March 2 killings of Mursal Waheedi, Saadia 
Sadat, and Shahnaz Raufi, who worked at 
Enikass News dubbing foreign language news 
reports. 
It is often not clear whether the ISKP, the 
Taliban, or other groups are responsible for 
some threats and attacks against women. In 
Ghazni province, the Taliban have instructed 
media outlets that the hosts of entertain-
ment programs should not be women, and 
that no music should be broadcasted. 
Farahnaz Forotan, one of Afghanistan’s 
best-known journalists noted for her hard- 
hitting interviews on Tolo News, left the 
country in November after hearing that she 
was on a Taliban blacklist and would soon be 
killed. 
She said that the Taliban: 
do not accept free media, and, in many 
events, they had rejected being interviewed 
by women. The reason they wanted to kill 
me, was because as a woman I am not ac-
cepted according to their values . . . The sit-
uation in Kabul is very scary. I know four 
journalists in Kandahar who left their jobs. 
The local media does not reflect it because 
they cannot. They are being threatened and 
the government cannot provide protection 
. . . Every morning I check messages to 
make sure that everyone is safe. I live with 
fear—it is very difficult to live with the fear 
of losing a loved one. 
Another 
Kabul-based 
journalist 
had 
worked as a producer for a television news 
outlet but left her job in mid-2020 after re-
ceiving threats. She said: 
The Taliban threatened me a couple of 
times on the phone, and they told me to 
leave my job. I also found a letter from the 
Taliban in a hole in our door. The letter re-
peated that I must not work anymore for 
news agencies because this job doesn’t suit 
me morally. If you continue, then you have 
no right to complain [about the con-
sequences].

journey if they wanted to take advantage of 
the offer. 
‘‘In order to come on an evacuation flight, 
they would have to get themselves to 
Kabul,’’ a senior official, who requested ano-
nymity in order to discuss the plan in detail, 
said on a call with reporters. ‘‘Obviously, we 
don’t have extensive U.S. military presence. 
We don’t have the ability to provide trans-
portation for them.’’ 
‘‘If they’re staying in the north of the 
country and they don’t feel safe staying in 
Afghanistan, they could go to a neighboring 
country’’ and finish their application process 
there, the official added. 
The United States also will not provide se-
curity to applicants outside Kabul, many of 
whom are under direct threat from the 
Taliban for cooperating with coalition forces 
during the war. 
With the American military in the final 
phases of withdrawing from Afghanistan, the 
White House has come under pressure to pro-
tect Afghan allies and speed up the process 
of providing them with special immigrant 
visas, and President Biden has vowed to do 
so. There have been about 20,000 applicants 
for the special visa program. 
This month, 2,500 Afghans will be sent in 
stages to an Army base in Fort Lee, Va., 
south of Richmond, where they will wait 
roughly 10 days for final processing. The 
next 4,000 applicants, who need further ap-
provals, will go with their families to other 
countries to complete the visa process before 
coming to the United States, the senior offi-
cial said. 
The official did not indicate which coun-
tries those applicants would be sent to com-
plete the visa process. 
The House is expected to pass legislation 
this week increasing the number of State De-
partment 
special 
immigrant 
visas 
and 
streamlining the application process.

WE MUST HELP THE AFGHAN INTERPRETERS 
WHO HELPED US 
(By Florent Groberg) 
Groberg received the Medal of Honor dur-
ing combat operations in Afghanistan, and is 
on the Advisory Board of With Honor Action. 
I lived by these words. That includes the 
day a suicide bomber hit and killed four men 
in my patrol in Asadabad, Afghanistan: Ser-
geant Major Kevin J. Griffin, Major Thomas 
E. Kennedy, Major Walter D. Gray, and 
USAID Foreign Service Officer Mr. Ragaei 
Abdelfattah. I think about them every day. 
The blast knocked me out. I woke up as 
my medic strapped a tourniquet to my leg 
and turned to my Afghan interpreter to as-
sist with bandages. Patrol after patrol, year 
after year, for twenty years, our Afghan in-
terpreters have stood by our side in harm’s 
way. Now we have a choice to stand by them. 
Taliban militants and terrorists have long 
targeted our interpreters, including their 
wives and children. By the time the U.S. 
withdraws from Afghanistan in September 
2021, there will be little defense left for these 
loyal allies. 
Another one of my Afghan interpreters 
reached out to me last week. He made it out 
of Afghanistan but his wife and kids are 
trapped and targeted. ‘‘The situation is get-
ting worse day by day in Afghanistan. I am 
worried for my wife and kids,’’ he wrote, 
‘‘Please help.’’ 
More than 17,000 Afghans who worked with 
U.S. forces, not to mention their family 
members, are still waiting for a decision 
from the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) 
program. The process is mired in a mad-
dening bureaucracy. Many have waited for 
years after going through security checks 
with practically every U.S. government 
agency imaginable, often at their own ex-
pense for health screenings and other re-
quirements. The situation has only become 
more dire of late with the U.S. Embassy in 
Kabul halting visa applicant interviews be-
cause of an escalating COVID–19 outbreak in 
Afghanistan. 
Every soldier I have spoken with who 
served in Afghanistan supports granting asy-
lum for loyal Afghan interpreters who have 
taken all the necessary security steps and 
are seeking this emergency asylum. Not only 
is granting asylum the right thing to do, it 
also benefits the U.S. by accepting talented 
and hardworking people, many of whom have 
already put it all on the line for our country. 
Members of the For Country Caucus in the 
U.S. House are leading the charge, including 
Democratic Representatives Jason Crow, 
Jared Golden, and Seth Moulton, and Repub-
licans Don Bacon, Adam Kinzinger, Peter 
Meijer, and Michael Waltz. These veterans 
have formed a task force and called on the 
White House, State Department, and Defense 
Department to immediately create a plan 
that can be executed before the final with-
drawal of U.S. forces this September. Sen-
ator Jeanne Shaheen and U.S. Army vet-
erans Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Jack 
Reed are forming a bipartisan coalition in 
the Senate. 
‘‘My concern is very simple,’’ Representa-
tive Crow said, ‘‘And that is if we pull out 
and don’t protect our Afghan partners, many 
of them will be killed.’’ 
Earlier this year, The Atlantic reported 
that Taliban militants hunted down and 
killed ‘‘Mohammad,’’ an interpreter who 
worked with U.S. forces for a decade and 
then spent nearly another decade trying to 
get through the SIV process with his wife 
and kids. Mohammad’s family just learned 
they finally have been approved for humani-
tarian parole. They are scheduled to be re-
settled in Texas shortly. My hope is we will 
hear many more stories of brave Afghan fam-
ilies, including that of my own interpreter, 
who will be granted asylum and can begin 
the next chapter of their lives in peace and 
shared prosperity. 
This will only happen if the U.S. steps up 
and protects the interpreters and families 
under threat. Our history points us to solu-
tions. The Ford Administration evacuated 
over 130,000 Vietnamese to Guam at the end 
of the Vietnam War. The Clinton Adminis-
tration did the same for Iraqi Kurds during 
Saddam Hussein’s regime. 
Whether through an emergency evacu-
ation, an expedited SIV process, an expan-
sion of other refugee and humanitarian pro-
grams, or a combination of all of these, the 
Biden administration should urgently make 
a plan and execute it. 
I am blessed to be a first-generation Amer-
ican and U.S. Army veteran who served with 
patriots, some of whom made the ultimate 
sacrifice. Our Afghan interpreters are patri-
ots, too. Now is the time to open our arms 
and stand by them, their wives, and their 
children. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
support the Afghan Special Immigrant 
Visa program, and I support its in-
creased numbers. I ask my colleagues: 
Don’t stop here. Let’s keep going. 
These are our friends, and democracy 
must prevail. 
Mr. Speaker, against the backdrop of a war 
that has demanded sacrifice and summoned 
patriotism, I rise in unequivocal support of 
H.R. 3985, ‘‘The Allies Act of 2021,’’ which 
honors the contributions of our allies in Af-
ghanistan by strengthening the Afghan Special 
Immigration Visa (SIV) Program. 
I wish to recognize my distinguished col-
league, the gentleman from Colorado, Con-
gressman CROW, who valiantly served three 
tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, for lead-
ing this bipartisan effort to uphold our commit-
ment to our partners in Afghanistan. 
This piece of legislation, which I am proud 
to co-sponsor, comes as we conclude a 
multigenerational war that has accomplished 
its principle objectives: rendering justice to 
those responsible for 9/11 and making sure 
that no attack on the homeland ever emerges 
from Afghanistan. 
Over the course of achieving this mission, 
we found critical allies and made invaluable 
friends, among them those who leveraged 
their skills and knowledge to protect our troops 
from harm. 
The Afghan Special Immigrant (SIV) Pro-
gram, created in 2009 to provide safety for Af-
ghan interpreters, contractors, and security 
personnel assisting U.S. efforts in the country, 
is more than a program. 
It is a promise—a promise to our allies that 
when they have our back, we have theirs. 
Specifically, the bill improves the SIV appli-
cation process by: 
amending the credible threat requirement; 
aligning applicant standards; 
clarifying eligibility for certain Afghans; 
streamlining duplicative procedures, and, 
increasing protections for surviving spouses. 
Reports on the ground indicate those Af-
ghan nationals who worked on behalf of the 
U.S. Government face extreme danger. 
Time is of the essence, and this bill re-
moves our friends and allies from the bureau-
cratic barriers of additional lengthy paperwork 
to establish a credible threat, when we already 
know that such a threat exists for individuals 
with verified ties to the U.S. government. 
Additionally, to qualify for the Afghan SIV 
Program under the current law, Afghan nation-
als who were employed by the International 
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) or Resolute 
Support (RS) must have performed ‘‘sensitive 
and trusted’’ work. 
This employment requirement was removed 
for U.S. Government employees 
in 
the 
FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act, 
but it remains for individuals employed under 
ISAF and RS. 
All current applicants must also submit an I– 
360 petition to USCIS after completing the 
State Department’s Chief of Mission process. 
This redundancy creates duplicative applica-
tions and introduces a gap in the process that 
allows for fraudulent petitions, ultimately slow-
ing down the processing time for all appli-
cants. 
The Allies Act of 2021 aligns standards 
across all types of employment and gives the 
Department of Homeland Security the flexi-
bility to not require I–360 petitions in cases 
where applicants have already proven eligi-
bility through the Chief of Mission Process. 
By making standards uniform, clear, and 
nonduplicative for all applicants, this bill 
streamlines application processing and en-
sures a more efficient safety plan for all our al-
lies. 
The bill also expands the types of individ-
uals eligible for the SIV. 
In practice, the original Afghan SIV statute 
only includes Afghan nationals who worked 
under U.S. government contracts. 
Yet we received support from many Afghan 
nationals under nongovernmental cooperative 
agreements and grants, including many key 
contacts working on critical democracy, human

rights, and governance work to assist the U.S. 
mission in Afghanistan. 
This bill makes clear that Afghan nationals 
that worked under such non-governmental 
agreements to advance the U.S. mission are 
eligible for the Afghan SIV program. 
In addition to previously excluded contrac-
tors, we must also acknowledge the danger 
surviving spouses face and place them at the 
front and center in our migration support ef-
forts as well. 
Currently, surviving spouses of deceased 
SIV applicants are not allowed to continue 
through the process if the primary SIV appli-
cant died before visa approval. 
The immediate families of our allies are also 
our allies and we must remove this dangerous 
obstacle for them to reach safety. 
The Allies Act of 2021 allows family mem-
bers of deceased primary applicants to con-
tinue through the process if their spouse had 
applied for Chief of Mission approval. 
We cannot leave our Afghan allies and their 
spouses vulnerable to the imminent threat of 
revenge from the Taliban. 
They simply are not safe at home and they 
need our help. 
The adaptations and amendments that this 
act offers would facilitate a path to safety and 
freedom for nearly 20,000 of on-the-ground 
partners whose work made possible all our 
advancements in that country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge us to act with com-
passion and honor our core American value of 
promoting freedom for all, for it was our rev-
erence for this value that characterized our ex-
tended presence in Afghanistan in the first 
place. 
It is time for us to ensure the safety and 
lives of our friends and allies in Afghanistan. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from New York for his lead-
ership and for the 2 minutes, which 
may be the most important 2 minutes 
I have had on the floor in a very, very 
long time, because what we debate here 
today is not an ideological disagree-
ment. It is not a question of whether 
you are a Republican or a Democrat, 
Mr. Speaker. It is a fundamental ques-
tion of who we are as a country and 
will we abide by the values that not 
only make us successful in times of 
war, but which distinguish us as a peo-
ple and allow us to say that we are an 
exceptional nation. 
When our troops—troops like JASON 
CROW, the sponsor of this legislation— 
go to engage in combat in foreign 
lands, they are armed and equipped 
with the very best technology money 
can buy. But from the human stand-
point, from the all-important humani-
tarian and cultural standpoint, they 
are blind and deaf. That is fixed by 
locals who risk everything, not nec-
essarily for the money, but because 
they believe in who we are. This is the 
moment when we return the favor by 
saying: If you stood with us, we will 
stand with you. 
It is far from a national security per-
spective, because God help those who 
go into a country if we don’t take care 
of those who helped us in Afghanistan. 
But, more importantly, it is about our 
values. 
Mr. Speaker, you know very well 
that our military has at its core the 
value that we leave no one behind. Now 
we decide whether we live by that 
value or whether we take the cheap, 
the easy, the quick, and ultimately, 
the dangerous way out. It is dangerous 
for the next conflict we find ourselves 
in and dangerous because of what that 
will tell the world about our commit-
ment to loyalty and the values that 
make us exceptional. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
b 1000 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that 
my colleague from Maryland, the dis-
tinguished ANTHONY
BROWN, is pre-
siding, having served in Iraq and served 
in the U.S. Army for a 30-year stint. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend, Representative CROW, for his 
leadership on this issue and in offering 
this legislation. 
Representative CROW, like Congress-
man BROWN, is one of the Members of 
this House from a new generation of 
service who wore the uniform of our 
country in the post-9/11 conflicts. 
These veterans of the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, like Representative 
CROW, understand what we must do to 
support our friends who stood with us, 
who risked their lives and the lives of 
their families with their American 
partners. 
The mission of our Armed Forces in 
Afghanistan over the past 20 years has 
been clear, although very extended: de-
stroy the terrorists who attacked us on 
9/11 and deny al-Qaida a safe haven 
from which to threaten global security 
in our country. Today, Osama bin 
Laden is dead and al-Qaida has been 
routed. Terrorism, however, has not 
gone away. 
Our troops are now coming home. 
The fate of the Afghan people will sure-
ly be determined by them, with our 
help, with us standing by. America will 
continue to support the Afghan Gov-
ernment and its security forces, but it 
is up to them to show the Taliban that 
there is no military solution and that 
their resolve is evident by their defense 
of their Nation. 
As American personnel return from 
Afghanistan, that country’s civil war 
will continue, and we cannot leave our 
Afghan partners behind. We talk about 
leaving no American behind. That is an 
absolutely essential premise as we send 
our men and women into harm’s way. 
Nor should we leave behind any of 
those who facilitated our efforts, who 
stood with us, who risked their own 
lives and put themselves in jeopardy. 
No one has any illusions about what 
the Taliban would do if they had their 
way and what they will do in those 
places they already control. They will 
take it out, and they will, in fact, lit-
erally take out those who stood with us 
and facilitated our efforts. There can 
be no doubt the punishment they would 
inflict on Afghans who stood alongside 
the United States and our allies. 
We can only imagine the horrors that 
would befall their families in retribu-
tion. This legislation recognizes that 
these Afghan allies have earned safety 
in our country for themselves and for 
their loved ones. It would expand the 
visa program and expedite processing 
to help ensure there is a path to Amer-
ica for Afghans who worked side by 
side with our troops, our diplomats, 
our development professionals, and our 
partner forces in carrying out our mis-
sions there. 
While President Biden is already tak-
ing executive action to bring some of 
these allies here, legislation is needed 
to ensure that all of them can make it 
safely out of harm’s way. It should be 
said, of course, that they will all be 
vetted to ensure that, in fact, they are 
coming to the United States and will 
be consistent with the security of our 
country and our people. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
bill today in a very bipartisan way. 
This is not about Democrats. It is not 
about Republicans. It is about an effort 
that Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations pursued and received 
help in doing so. Each vote is not only 
an assent for this sound policy, but a 
gesture of our deep appreciation for the 
service of our allies. 
Let this vote remind the world that 
our country’s steadfast foundation, our 
highest ideal remains our bonds of 
friendship, loyalty, and trust. Let us 
remind our friends and foes alike that 
Americans keep faith with our allies, 
and let us practice that in this body 
and at the White House. 
I ask my colleagues, Democrats and 
Republicans alike: Vote for this bill. 
We can argue about differences of opin-
ion on our effort in Afghanistan, but 
when we do something, whether we 
argue one side or the other, when we 
ask people to help us in that effort, 
help us, America, our men and women 
in uniform in harm’s way, when we ask 
those to help us, it is important for us 
to keep the faith with those who do. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Allies Act. It is our 
moral obligation to honor the promises 
we made to our Afghan allies and en-
sure that those who risked their lives 
for the U.S. mission are safely relo-
cated, but it is patently clear that the 
Special Immigrant Visa program, as it 
currently exists, is not up to the task. 
Staffing shortages and bureaucratic 
hurdles have resulted in years-long 
delays in the process and a backlog of 
over 18,000 applications.

July 22, 2021 
The Allies Act will help speed up the 
process by streamlining duplicative 
procedures and removing unnecessary 
requirements, while maintaining the 
necessary security and vetting proce-
dures. It also expands eligibility for 
those who are unfairly left out of the 
program, most critically, surviving 
spouses and children of applicants who 
died or were killed by the Taliban be-
fore visa approval. 
Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the 
recent news of the plans to begin evac-
uating some of these Afghan inter-
preters, but make no mistake, there is 
much more to be done. We have a re-
sponsibility to ensure that those who 
risked their lives serving alongside 
U.S. and coalition forces are both 
swiftly evacuated and given a path to 
safety. 
This bill is a significant step toward 
that goal and will help ensure that 
America lives up to the promises made 
to those brave individuals and their 
families. I am proud to support this 
bill, and I call on all of my colleagues 
to do so today. I urge passage. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in 
permitting me to speak on this bill. 
I never served in theater, but I have 
worked on this issue for 14 years. We 
started with Senator John McCain and 
Senator Kennedy, and it moved for-
ward on a bipartisan basis, both the 
House and the Senate, with the special 
immigrant visa. But, sadly, it always 
was too slow, too bureaucratic, and 
there really wasn’t the sense of ur-
gency that was necessary to make sure 
that the people who put their lives on 
the line to help Americans in these dif-
ficult circumstances were dealt with. 
Something has changed. First of all, 
President Biden has made an extraor-
dinarily difficult call that we are going 
to wind down that presence of the 
United States in terms of military. It 
is a difficult call. It was one that need-
ed 
to 
be 
made 
because 
the 
cir-
cumstances were not going to change. 
If it was 5 years, 10 years, it would just 
be more billions of dollars and more 
lives; putting off the day of reckoning. 
I admire the President for doing so, 
but I hope he brings that same sense of 
urgency to deal with these people who 
we can’t afford to leave behind. 
Another thing that has changed is 
the energy of new Members of Congress 
who served in the theater; my col-
league, JASON
CROW. We just heard 
from PETER MEIJER. They have added a 
sense of urgency on a bipartisan basis 
that has helped us craft this legisla-
tion, that will solve the problems if we 
are willing to implement it in full 
force. 
I call upon the administration to ex-
pedite the transition. I call on all of us 
to continue to make sure that we pro-
vide the resources, the attention, and 
the urgency to make the program suc-
cessful. But make no mistake, we have 
a lot of work to do to protect people 
who helped us. Being a friend should 
not be fatal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this 
legislation as an important next step 
and urge that we redouble our efforts 
to make it successful. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MOULTON). 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, 51, that 
is how many days until our official 
withdrawal from Afghanistan; 800, that 
is how many days it takes to process a 
single special immigrant visa; 21,000, 
that is how many of our Afghan allies 
put their lives on the line, not just for 
their country, but for ours, who are at 
risk of being beaten, tortured, be-
headed, 
and 
slaughtered 
by 
the 
Taliban. And make no mistake, if they 
can get their hands on our friends, that 
is what the Taliban will do. 
So the math is clear. We are out of 
time. The stakes are clear. Our reputa-
tion as a country, our ability to find 
allies in future conflicts, the willing-
ness of people all over the globe to 
work for America because they trust us 
to uphold our own values, that is what 
is on the line. 
We have to pass the Allies Act. The 
administration needs to conduct a full 
evacuation because we do not leave 
people behind. We are the United 
States of America. Let’s remind the 
world of that today. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a tragedy in so 
many ways; the loss of so many of the 
best and brightest of our youth because 
of political and military leaders who 
were willing to put them in harm’s way 
but without a commitment to victory 
and without the willingness to back 
them with the full might of the United 
States. 
For Afghanistan, it means the best 
and brightest of that country, the very 
people who were willing to risk their 
futures for freedom are the ones who 
are now being forced to flee, depriving 
Afghanistan of the most patriotic citi-
zens who could otherwise have formed 
the core of a free government if we had 
finished the job we started. 
It is to be greatly hoped that like the 
Iranian diaspora, they will focus their 
energy from abroad to support the re-
sistance movement that is sure to 
emerge under the yoke of Taliban op-
pression. It is to be greatly hoped that 
our Nation will finally return to a tra-
dition that served us well for nearly 200 
years; that there is no substitute for 
victory and no excuse for waging war 
without the absolute commitment to 
swiftly win it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am heartened to see 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
speak in support of this important bill. 
It is vital that we pass this legislation 
and it is vital that we do so quickly. As 
we speak, nearly 20,000 of our Afghan 
allies are facing increasing threats 
from the Taliban and insurgent groups. 
The administration will begin evacu-
ating some individuals at the end of 
this month. 
As Members of Congress, we must 
also do our part to honor the sacrifices 
made by these brave men and women 
and pass the Allies Act. It is much too 
bad that we cannot do more, but this is 
the least that we can do. I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, many Members 
here, including myself, have traveled to Af-
ghanistan for years to express our gratitude to 
our heroic men and women in uniform serving 
there. We remain in awe of their patriotism 
and courage. 
And just as awe-inspiring are their partners 
on the ground: the local Afghan interpreters, 
drivers, embassy staff, contractors, security 
personnel and others who have worked shoul-
der-to-shoulder with the American military and 
our diplomatic personnel. 
These Afghan partners have been vital to 
the safety of American lives and to the suc-
cess of our mission. They accepted an ex-
traordinary risk to their lives and families, with 
the understanding that we would stand by 
them. 
And now, they are under attack—facing the 
threat of deadly retribution from the Taliban. 
Today, with the ALLIES Act, the U.S. Con-
gress is honoring our promises to these brave 
heroes: to respect their service and to not 
leave them behind. 
Thank you to Congressman JASON CROW— 
a former Army Ranger who served our Nation 
in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
He, with Congressman SETH MOULTON and 
the entire bipartisan ‘‘Honoring our Promises’’ 
Working Group, has been firm, principled and 
relentless in fighting for this legislation and 
other action to protect our ‘‘Afghan allies.’’ 
Earlier this summer, with their leadership, 
the House proudly passed the HOPE for Af-
ghan SIVS Act, which took the first step in that 
mission. 
This group has also been instrumental in 
coordinating Congress’s response with the 
Biden-Harris Administration. 
As President Biden has said, ‘‘Those who 
helped us are not going to be left behind.’’ 
And with his action this week, evacuating Af-
ghan partners to Fort Lee as they await final 
processing, that promise is being honored. 
The Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Ex-
pediting SIVs Act will fix the Afghan Special 
Immigrant Visa (SIV) process, created over a 
decade ago to provide safety for Afghan inter-
preters, contractors, security personnel and 
others who worked with the United States. 
Sadly and unconscionably, the SIV process 
has long been plagued by severe delays and 
backlogs, leaving many applicants waiting 
years for their visas—and hundreds have 
been killed before receiving approval. 
Currently, there are many thousands of ap-
plicants in the pipeline, not including their 
spouses and children. This delay is not only 
demoralizing—it is deadly, because of the im-
minent danger posed by Taliban.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3817 
July 22, 2021 
The ALLIES Act builds on the HOPE for Af-
ghan SIVs Act, as it increases the Afghan SIV 
cap, streamlines the application process and 
strengthens protections for surviving spouses 
and children, among other important steps. 
And it does this without compromising the 
strict background check and national security 
vetting procedures or other processes to con-
firm eligibility. 
The threat facing our ‘‘Afghan allies,’’ as the 
national security and defense community calls 
them, cannot be overstated. 
According to the nonprofit organization No 
One Left Behind, more than 300 translators 
and their family members have been killed 
since 2014. Many died while waiting for their 
visas to be processed. 
Over 90 percent of the hundreds of Afghan 
partners report having received at least one 
death threat because of their work with Ameri-
cans. 
One Afghan partner, who has been waiting 
six years for a visa decision, worries, ‘‘If the 
Taliban take over, they’ll easily find me and kill 
me. Then my wife will have no husband and 
my daughter will have no father.’’ 
Another says, ‘‘I get phone calls from the 
Taliban saying, ‘We will kill you.’ They know 
who I am and that I worked for the Americans. 
If they find me, they’ll torture me and then kill 
me. It’s better if I just kill myself first.’’ 
These courageous allies cannot wait a day 
longer. 
As the United States prepares for and exe-
cutes the strategic and important withdrawal 
from Afghanistan, we must do so in a way that 
protects those who protected us. 
With that, I urge a strong and bipartisan 
vote for our ‘‘Afghan allies.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 535, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 407, nays 16,

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given

marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for 
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the floor schedule for next 
week, and I welcome the majority lead-
er back to the colloquy. It is good to 
see him spry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3818 
July 22, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), my friend. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House 
will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour 
and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with 
votes postponed until 10:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 
10 a.m. I want to make that clear. That 
is an acceleration from 12 p.m. We have 
a lot of business to do next week. We 
have a lot of appropriations bills, so we 
want to make sure that we are not 
meeting late, late into the night. 
So on Tuesday, the House will meet 
at 10 a.m. for morning hour and 12 p.m. 
for legislative business. 
On Wednesday, the House is expected 
to meet at 11 a.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
On Thursday, the House will expect 
to meet at 10 a.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
On Friday, the House will meet, as 
usual, at 9 a.m. for legislative business. 
The House will consider several bills 
under suspension of the rules. The com-
plete list of suspensions will be an-
nounced by close of business tomorrow. 
In addition, the House will consider 
at least 7 of the 12 appropriations bills 
for fiscal year 2022. 
Recognizing the importance of com-
pleting our work well in advance of the 
deadline at the end of September, I 
would let the Members know that, un-
fortunately—well, first of all, let me 
say, we have marked up all 12 bills, and 
they have been reported out of com-
mittee. 
The Senate has not reported out, nor 
considered a single appropriation bill. 
And we have 60 days before the end of 
the fiscal year, approximately, give or 
take. 
The House will consider a seven-bill 
minibus, H.R. 4502. That bill will in-
clude seven appropriations bills: the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies bill; 
and Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies; Energy and Water 
Development, and Related Agencies; 
Financial Services and General Gov-
ernment; Interior, Environment, and 
Related Agencies; Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies; Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations Act. 
There will be additional bills on the 
appropriations. There are, obviously, 
after the seven, five additional appro-
priation bills that will be available for 
consideration. Three of those bills, as I 
understand it, have been noticed by the 
Committee on Rules for amendments 
to be filed. So they will be ready to go 
next week, and I am hopeful that we 
will be able to move some of those bills 
next week. 
They will be the Legislative Branch 
appropriation bill; the Commerce, Jus-
tice, Science, and Related Agencies ap-
propriation bill; and the Department of 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs appropriation bill. That will 
leave the Department of Defense bill 
and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity bill. 
Lastly, additional legislative items 
are possible. And that will be our 
schedule for the week to come. I expect 
it to be long days, which is why we are 
going in at 11 a.m. on one day and at 10 
a.m. on two of the days, which we usu-
ally go in at 12. I would hope that that 
would preclude us from going very late 
at night, but I think everybody ought 
to expect that we will be here into the 
evening. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for that information as 
we look toward this appropriations 
process coming to the floor next week. 
I would hope it doesn’t take the same 
tone that it took in committee, and 
that is a hyper-partisan approach, 
which in years past, we have seen Re-
publicans and Democrats come to-
gether to ultimately determine how 
best to fund this United States Govern-
ment. And any bill that is going to get 
sent to the President’s desk is going to 
ultimately be a bipartisan bill. 
Unfortunately, that is not the bill 
that is going to be coming to the floor. 
There are a lot of very extreme radical 
elements that were put in that bill, but 
there was also something very alarm-
ing, and that was a break, a departure, 
from over 40 years of bipartisan agree-
ment on what is known as the Hyde 
amendment. 
Henry Hyde, in the 1970s, was able to 
get agreement between Republicans 
and Democrats to say on all the things 
we may disagree with, let’s at least 
agree that taxpayer funding should not 
be 
used 
for 
abortions. 
And 
over-
whelming majorities of Republicans 
and Democrats have supported that 
going back to 1976. 
This appropriations bill guts the 
Hyde amendment. And why this Demo-
crat majority decided to break from 
decades of bipartisan agreement on 
Hyde is perplexing. But I would hope, 
among many other things, we would be 
able to have that full debate on the 
House floor; that amendments like re-
storing Hyde would be made in order, 
not a closed process, not a very narrow 
process where the goal would be to 
push a hyper-partisan bill out of the 
House that won’t become law, which 
means it would be a very futile exer-
cise that we would be participating in 
next week, but, in fact, to work in a bi-
partisan way on those things that we 
can come to an agreement on about 
how to properly fund the government. 
I am not sure if that is being antici-
pated with the seven bills that are 
coming in this bloated bus, but I would 
hope that the majority, as the Rules 
Committee looks to determine which 
amendments would be made in order, 
would go to an open process and let 
things like the Hyde amendment be de-
bated, and frankly, to be supported in 
the bipartisan way that it has always 
enjoyed going back over 40 years. 
Mr. Speaker, maybe the gentleman 
could shed light on that, and I would 
yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. He is 
certainly 
accurate 
that 
the 
Hyde 
amendment has been in our bills for a 
very long period of time. What I think 
is not completely accurate is that it 
has been a bipartisan support, has en-
joyed bipartisan support, and that 
there were Democrats who obviously 
supported the Hyde amendment. 
And I realize that this has made it 
controversial, having been left out of 
the bill. I don’t know what the Com-
mittee on Rules is going to do; we will 
have to see what they do. But in any 
event, I want to tell you that a large 
number on our side of the aisle believe 
that 
a 
constitutionally 
protected 
healthcare matter for women ought 
not to be determined by their financial 
ability. 
So there is controversy with respect 
to Hyde. There is also controversy with 
respect to Federal employees as well, 
that I know well, because I chaired 
that subcommittee. We give to Federal 
employees the healthcare benefit, but 
then we say they can’t use it for some 
things. Actually, that money is their 
money; it is not our money. It is given 
in compensation for their services. 
But in any event, so there are con-
troversies, I would tell the gentleman, 
and I am not sure exactly what the 
Committee on Rules is going to do and, 
therefore, don’t want to speak for it. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, hope-
fully, like I said, we get the oppor-
tunity to have that open debate proc-
ess so that we can bring amendments 
like restoring Hyde to this floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to ask 
about something that is going to be 
coming up next week, and that is this 
January 6 Commission that the Speak-
er created is expected to meet next 
week. 
Yesterday, we saw an alarming de-
parture from Congressional tradition, 
and that is Speaker PELOSI unilater-
ally made a decision to remove minor-
ity members from that committee. You 
go through the history of Congress, and 
prior to this year, never has the Speak-
er denied the minority the ability to 
choose who they are going to put on 
committees. And not only did it hap-
pen yesterday with multiple members, 
a ranking member of a standing com-
mittee was removed, an officer in the 
United States Navy was removed from 
that committee, without explanation. 
That, first of all, undermines all 
credibility that this committee will 
have. It is clear that now it is an at-
tempt by the Speaker to just com-
pletely politicize that committee. Why 
the majority chose to abuse power in 
that way and deny minority rights in 
that way is perplexing, but it doesn’t 
bode well for the institution, and it 
surely doesn’t bode well for the impar-
tiality and the credibility of this com-
mittee. 
I don’t know if the majority is look-
ing at reconsidering that decision, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3819 
July 22, 2021 
obviously, it is unprecedented. And if 
the gentleman wants to explain that, I 
will be happy to yield. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I think the 
gentleman can explain it. I think, 
frankly, your party is hoist on its own 
petard. We brought to this floor, with 
Mr. KATKO and Mr. THOMPSON agreeing 
on the process, offering to the House an 
equally divided five-and-five commis-
sion; the five Republicans being totally 
in the ambit of the minority leader. We 
brought it to the floor; the subpoena 
power being equally divided between 
the parties and having to cooperate in 
accomplishing the issuance of the sub-
poena. And very frankly, although 
there was some discussion of it, there 
was no doubt that the staff would have 
been resolved. The question of being 
equal staff on the Republican and 
Democratic side would have been re-
solved in the Senate. 
I see the gentleman shaking his head. 
I can tell him, I know it would have 
been resolved; period. And the Repub-
lican Party objected to that commis-
sion, equally divided, five and five, 
with the minority leader strenuously 
lobbying against it being passed in the 
United States Senate. It was not 
passed in the United States Senate. 
Press asked me, If it is defeated in 
the Senate, what are you going to do? 
I said, We are going to move forward, 
of course. And that is what we are 
doing. We are moving forward. 
Now, the makeup of that committee, 
three of the persons who were ap-
pointed by the—excuse me—were rec-
ommended by the minority leader were 
accepted by the Speaker. And I am not 
going to spend a long time going into 
the quotes of the two or their premise, 
but all I can say is when asked the 
question, Ms. CHENEY, who I know you 
folks have kicked out of leadership be-
cause she tells the truth. 
Mr. SCALISE. That was not the rea-
son that Ms. CHENEY was removed as 
chair. 
Mr. HOYER. Well, that is certainly 
one of the statements, however. 
Mr. SCALISE. It had nothing to do 
with the statements that were made. 
Mr. HOYER. That is one opinion. 
Mr. SCALISE. An opinion we don’t 
share because it is not accurate. 
Mr. HOYER. Well, I clearly know we 
don’t share that view, but it was ref-
erenced that, well she may have told 
the truth but she ought to stop telling 
the truth. 
And that was one of the references 
that were made as you replaced her as 
your third in line because she—from 
our perspective—and I think from a 
large perspective of the American peo-
ple—told the truth, and she continues 
to tell the truth. 
And she was asked the question: 
What do you think about this non-
partisan investigation? She said, I am 
absolutely confident that we will have 
a nonpartisan investigation that will 
look at the facts; that it will go wher-
ever the facts may lead. There are 
three members from the minority lead-
er proposed that the Speaker did not 
object to. She has objected to two 
members. And the rhetoric around this 
from minority leader and from those 
two members has been disgraceful. 
Thus, this must be an investigation 
that is focused on facts. And the idea 
that any of this has become politicized 
is really unworthy of the office that we 
all hold and unworthy of our Republic. 
So I don’t blame you, and I probably 
would have taken the same reaction as 
you have taken. But very frankly, from 
the Speaker’s perspective, and from 
others, this needs to be a commission 
that does in fact commit itself to going 
where the facts lead and determining 
the who, what, where, when, and why. 
I have some very strong feelings as to 
why the insurrection, or as some say, 
the tourist visit—on your side of the 
aisle, Mr. Whip—the tourist visit that 
resulted in the death of a number of 
people, terrorizing Members of this 
House who thought their lives were in 
danger because people were trying to 
break into the House Chamber. 
The rationalization of that activity 
has been rampant by many on your 
side of the aisle. We have some strong 
feelings on this, and we are going to 
get to the facts. And the American peo-
ple will make the ultimate judgment, 
obviously. And we want to see that 
commission, again, hoist on your own 
petard, the overwhelming majority of 
you voted against a commission. Five 
Republicans appointed by the minority 
leader—appointed 
by, 
not 
rec-
ommended by—and five Democrats; 
subpoena power shared, and notwith-
standing the fact that some of you, ap-
parently, don’t agree. I guarantee you, 
it would have been equal staffing. That 
would have been resolved. That was not 
a really big issue. 
It was a make-up issue to vote ‘‘no’’ 
in the United States Senate because, in 
our view—so you understand—Donald 
Trump didn’t want the commission. 
b 1115 
So, Donald Trump was saluted, and 
we didn’t get a commission, which was 
a commission that almost exactly to 
the jot and tittle, as Mr. KATKO said, 
what the minority leader asked for. 
So, you don’t like the result now. I 
get it. But I believe, as Ms. CHENEY 
said, this is going to be a factfinding 
select committee. Witnesses will say 
what they are going to say. 
By the way, one of the people that 
was rejected by the Speaker may well 
be, and maybe both, witnesses before 
the select committee. I don’t know 
that. Nobody has told me that. But 
that may be the case. 
So, we are going to proceed. I know 
there is disagreement. That is not sur-
prising. But you looked the oppor-
tunity that you asked for in the eye 
and rejected it, so here we are. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, that 
wasn’t the opportunity that we asked 
for, and I think the majority leader 
knows that the minority leader put a 
number of issues on the table that he 
wanted included in that review, and 
those were rejected. They were rejected 
by the Speaker, and they were rejected 
by the majority. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. The majority leader 
will have an opportunity, but there 
were a number of things you said that 
I think need to be cleaned up because 
they are just not accurate. 
If you look at the Members that were 
kicked off from the minority side yes-
terday—still no explanation given, by 
the way—that includes a ranking mem-
ber of a committee and an officer in 
the United States Navy who was re-
moved yesterday by Speaker PELOSI 
with no reason given in an unprece-
dented way. 
Maybe Speaker PELOSI
and maybe 
this majority don’t want to see all the 
facts come out because those two Mem-
bers who were removed yesterday were 
raising very serious questions that 
ought to be answered, whatever those 
answers are. Whatever those facts are, 
they were publicly raising questions. 
Maybe because they raised those 
questions that might be uncomfortable 
for the majority, they were removed 
from the committee with no expla-
nation given. That had never happened 
before in the history of this Congress. 
Again, if you want the facts, don’t sit 
there and say that you want the facts 
if you are going to remove people who 
are trying to get facts, who are raising 
serious questions that should be an-
swered. They raised them publicly, and 
they were going to raise them in the 
committee. Maybe because they were 
going to raise those tough questions, 
they were removed by the Speaker, 
Members of the minority who were re-
moved by the Speaker. 
I don’t know if that is the new prece-
dent that the majority leader wants to 
see in the future. But I will tell you, 
since the gentleman likes quoting LIZ 
CHENEY, I will read this quote from LIZ 
CHENEY: ‘‘Speaker PELOSI and the Dem-
ocrat majority have no business deter-
mining which Republicans sit on com-
mittees.’’ That is from LIZ CHENEY, if 
the gentleman wants to quote. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, is that a 
quote about Mrs. GREENE? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, that is a 
quote about Mrs. GREENE, but it is a 
general quote about whoever it is. You 
could go down your list. 
By the way, there were Members of 
the majority who are on that com-
mittee who voted on January 6 to re-
ject electors. Maybe not this year’s 
January 6, but as the gentleman 
knows, every Republican President this 
century has had Democrats on this 
House floor object to electors being 
seated, including multiple members of 
the January 6 committee on the major-
ity side. They weren’t removed. In fact, 
they were appointed by the Speaker. 
Yet, two of our Members, who raised 
very serious questions about facts that 
should be answered, wherever those an-
swers 
lead, 
were 
removed 
because

maybe the majority doesn’t want all 
the facts to come out. Maybe they only 
want a certain narrative to come out. 
That is not an investigation. That is a 
kangaroo court, if that is the approach 
that is going to be taken. 
But the action taken yesterday by 
the Speaker, the unprecedented action, 
undermines the credibility of that 
commission, and it is a shame for the 
institution because the Members we 
appointed were going there to find the 
facts, to help participate in finding the 
facts. 
Clearly, that is not the interest now 
of this committee. That was exposed 
yesterday in the Speaker’s unprece-
dented action. 
It is not something that this institu-
tion, whether it is Republicans running 
it or Democrats—and as the gentleman 
knows, that pendulum swings both 
ways. But never before this year had a 
majority removed Members that mi-
nority leaders submitted for commit-
tees. It is just not what has happened 
in this institution. But, now, it seems 
to be the norm because maybe some 
people that are asking tough questions 
are asking too tough of questions that 
this majority doesn’t want to be an-
swered, kind of why this majority 
won’t have a hearing on the origins of 
COVID. 
In fact, it was Mr. JORDAN, along 
with myself and others, who has raised 
serious 
questions 
that 
have 
been 
backed up by many medical experts 
around this country that COVID–19 
very likely started in the Wuhan lab 
and was leaked out. Medical experts 
from every walk of life have looked at 
the genetic makeup of this COVID–19 
virus and said it couldn’t have been 
transferred from bats to animals to hu-
mans. In fact, it was likely modified 
genetically in the lab in Wuhan. 
Yet, there is not a single hearing 
that has been held by this majority on 
whether it was gain-of-function re-
search, possibly funded with taxpayer 
money. All of those questions should be 
raised, but maybe the majority doesn’t 
want those facts to come out. 
We should want the facts to come out 
wherever they lead. So don’t pound the 
desk and say you want the facts when 
you remove people who are asking 
questions to get at the facts. It 
shouldn’t be a one-sided question and 
argument. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the legisla-
tion we passed said the Speaker would 
appoint all the members. These Mem-
bers were not kicked off; they never 
got on. 
LIZ CHENEY was asked whether that 
was the appropriate thing to do, and 
her response was—you had her quote: 
‘‘I agree with what the Speaker has 
done.’’ 
Now, the reason she agreed—yes, 
they have raised questions, and on your 
side, you wanted to raise questions. 
You wanted to look at everything but 
January 6. Maybe January 6 as well, 
but you wanted to look at this inci-
dent, that incident, the other incident, 
the incident over here. Are they rel-
evant incidents? Sure, they are; but 
not to January 6. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, but why 
not look at all of them? 
Mr. HOYER. Clearly, when you were 
in charge, you didn’t look at some of 
the incidents that happened while you 
were in charge that were similar in na-
ture. Very frankly, I think those inci-
dents ought to be looked at, but not by 
this commission because they were in-
cidents that did not involve insurrec-
tion; did not involve stopping the work 
of the Congress of the United States; 
did not terrorize Members of this 
House. 
Now, I know that some of you have 
had pictures taken of you in this 
House. You looked pretty terrified to 
me. You thought there was something 
serious happening. This stuff that this 
was a tourist visit is absurd. 
The issue of dissembling is not new. 
President Trump put that in an art 
form. If he didn’t like what was going 
on here, he created something over 
here with a tweet or a comment or an 
action that he took. That is the shell 
game. 
The issue is: What happened on Janu-
ary 6? What was the insurrection 
about? Why were people coming into 
the Capitol saying: Let’s hang the Vice 
President of the United States—not of 
our party. 
People shake their heads. I am not 
sure why they are shaking their heads. 
They saw it on television. They see it 
on the tapes over and over and over. 
They see people being convicted. I hap-
pen to think the sentences are too 
short. It was treason. It was treason 
based upon a lie. 
We need to get to the bottom of it. 
What the Speaker has done is make 
sure that we are going to get to the 
bottom of it, notwithstanding the fact, 
and I will repeat again, all of you had 
the opportunity to vote five—five— 
shared subpoena, and the leader was 
empowered to appoint anybody he 
would want. 
The 
legislation 
that 
passed 
this 
House said the Speaker would ap-
point—the Speaker. Did she consult 
with the minority leader? She did. Did 
she disagree with two that he ap-
pointed? She did, and she did not ap-
point them. That was in her power. 
And I agreed with her, and LIZ CHENEY 
agreed with her. 
Why? Because that would have been 
dissembling, not looking for facts. Mr. 
JORDAN has said over and over again 
that he believes the election was sto-
len. Court after court after court after 
court said no proof. No proof. 
So, we are where we are, and we are 
going to proceed. We are going to pro-
ceed, and if the Speaker decides to re-
tain the three and name two others, so 
be it. 
We are going to proceed. We are 
going to proceed, and we are going to 
get the facts, and we are going to get 
those facts known to the American 
people. It is going to be widely covered. 
There are going to be a lot of wit-
nesses. We are going to find out the 
who. Maybe that is the problem: the 
who, the what, the where, and the why. 
For the first time in history, Ameri-
cans, Trump signs waving, stopped the 
business of the Congress of the United 
States—an insurrection and, from my 
view, a treasonous act. So, we are 
going to proceed. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, if the 
facts were what the majority wants, 
then the majority wouldn’t be afraid of 
certain Members asking tough ques-
tions that maybe the majority doesn’t 
want. 
Since the gentleman brought up Mr. 
JORDAN, I will tell you a question that 
Mr. JORDAN has been raising publicly. 
One of the questions Mr. JORDAN has 
been raising is: Why weren’t the Cap-
itol Police better equipped when there 
was intelligence prior, weeks prior to 
January 6, that there may be large 
crowds, that there may be threats? 
Why weren’t the Capitol Police more 
equipped? Were National Guard offered 
to the Capitol that were rejected? And 
at what level, if that is the case, were 
they rejected? 
Maybe he was starting to ask those 
questions. Maybe he should have just 
sat back and not raised those questions 
until after the committee started, but 
he started raising those questions. 
By the way, they are important ques-
tions to be answered, but he won’t be 
able to ask those questions about why 
the 
Capitol 
Police 
weren’t 
better 
equipped 
because 
Speaker 
PELOSI 
yanked him off the committee when he 
was selected by the minority leader. 
You can talk about the power of the 
Speaker and brag that that is her 
power, but just because you have the 
might doesn’t make it right. What she 
did was an abuse. To say, ‘‘I am just 
going to choose who on the Republican 
side I am going to allow, but, boy, if 
some other Members are going to ask 
tough questions, I have the power to 
take them off,’’ that is not what power 
is used for. 
This 
House, 
this 
democracy, 
we 
should want the facts. If some Members 
are going to ask tough questions, you 
should want everybody to be asking 
tough questions. If the facts lead there, 
you go there. If the facts don’t lead 
there, you go somewhere else and ask 
more tough questions. 
If some Members are going to ask 
tough questions that the majority 
doesn’t want to be asked, that under-
mines the credibility of that commis-
sion to remove them from asking those 
questions. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, does the 
gentleman believe that the three Mem-
bers that the Speaker accepted and was 
willing to appoint would not have 
asked those questions? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, they 
haven’t said publicly whether they

would or not. Mr. JORDAN sure did. 
Again, maybe he was punished for rais-
ing tough questions in advance of the 
hearing instead of waiting. 
But in the end, those were questions. 
Sheriff Nehls, who was also one of our 
selections, was right there with these 
brave Capitol Police officers, holding 
down the House of Representatives so 
that the Chamber wasn’t breached. 
Sheriff Nehls was right there. 
But, again, if the integrity of that 
commission is now undermined because 
Speaker PELOSI chose to remove people 
who were going to ask tougher ques-
tions, then, ultimately, it proves that 
this is not a commission set on finding 
the facts. It is a commission set on es-
tablishing a narrative regardless of the 
facts. That is a disgrace, for this insti-
tution to go down that road. 
There is still time to reconsider. Mr. 
Speaker, I would urge the majority to 
reconsider how they use or abuse the 
power that is vested upon them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
b 1130 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Your side had an opportunity to sup-
port the Capitol Police. Your side had 
an opportunity to support law enforce-
ment. Your side had the opportunity to 
increase the capability of the Capitol 
Police to respond to insurrectionist, 
violent, and criminal agents. 
Your side had that opportunity, and 
what did it do, to a person? 
It voted ‘‘no,’’ and we passed it. We 
passed support of the Capitol Police. 
We passed support to strengthen our 
defenses. We passed legislation to try 
to make the Capitol more secure and 
our Capitol Police safer. We passed 
that legislation with not a single one 
of your votes. It went to the Senate, 
and it sits. You read what that is doing 
to the morale of the Capitol Police 
along with some of your comments 
about the Capitol Police. 
So you had that opportunity. 
I will say to the Speaker, Repub-
licans had that opportunity. Just as 
they rejected the five and five, they re-
jected support of the Capitol Police. 
Seventeen of them voted against giv-
ing them a Gold Medal. 
Why? 
Because the insurrection was men-
tioned in the resolution, and, of course, 
there was no insurrection. It was a 
tourist visit, as they ambled politely 
through the Halls of the Congress say-
ing how appreciative they were of the 
efforts being made by their Democratic 
Representatives. 
If you saw it that way, if you believe 
that, it is impossible for me to under-
stand why. 
So I tell the whip, Mr. Speaker, that 
the Republican Party has had two op-
portunities to have an even, fair com-
mission. They rejected them, appar-
ently, according to what the whip says, 
because we didn’t want to look at Se-
attle, we didn’t want to look at this 
city or that city or the other city or 
this, that, and the other. 
By the way, President Biden made it 
very clear that those who committed 
criminal 
activities 
were 
not 
dem-
onstrators, they were criminals. Biden 
said that, and I agree with him. 
What they didn’t want to look at is 
who recruited the crowd that came in 
here, who riled that crowd up, and who 
deployed them to the Capitol of the 
United States for the specific objective 
of stopping the steal, and what he 
meant, of course, is our acting. 
His Vice President, whom he talked 
to on numerous occasions about stop-
ping the election, concluded that that 
was not legal, that was not within his 
authority, and so he acted consistent 
with the law. That really annoyed Mr. 
Trump. 
So here we are. We should have had a 
bipartisan commission. We should have 
moved that forward, and, yes, we 
should support the Capitol Police by 
adopting the supplemental. 
By the way, the Senate supplemental 
is more in terms of dollars than the 
House supplemental. So it is not a 
question of we spent too much money 
to do this to make the Capitol safe, to 
make the Capitol Police armed, to give 
them the opportunity to get the intel-
ligence that they need to proceed. 
But what a distraction that the Cap-
itol Police weren’t prepared. 
The question is not: Were they pre-
pared? 
The question is: Why did American 
citizens try to commit insurrection 
and treason in the Capitol of the 
United States and stopped our work? 
Not for very long. We came back, we 
did our work, and we got it done to the 
benefit of our country, our democracy, 
and our image around the world. Our 
democracy was resilient. 
Nobody was angrier, I will tell you— 
and I think Mr. SCALISE, you were 
there—Mr. 
Speaker, 
nobody 
was 
angrier about what was happening that 
night than MITCH MCCONNELL, the lead-
er of the Senate, who said he believed 
subsequent to his voting against im-
peachment, but notwithstanding that, 
he believed the President bore respon-
sibility, as the minority leader said, 
not all responsibility, but bore respon-
sibility. 
So we are going to look at this. You 
can talk all you want. Your leader has 
now decided he is going to withdraw 
the three and not participate. We re-
gret that. But it is not going to stop 
us. It is not going to stop our getting 
at the truth. It is not going to stop our 
having the American people know the 
who, what, where, when, and why of 
the first time since 1812 when a foreign 
power invaded our Capitol that the 
Capitol of the United States was in-
vaded by people who were seeking to 
undermine the democratic processes 
under our Constitution. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, it is un-
fortunate that as that commission 
starts, it will not include other Mem-
bers, Republican Members, who wanted 
to ask some of those tough questions in 
terms of supporting the police. 
I don’t think the gentleman has seen 
any stronger support for police than on 
this side of the aisle. I have been 
maybe more vocal than anyone about 
support for the United States Capitol 
Police because I wouldn’t be here alive 
today without the bravery and heroism 
of the Capitol Police, and I think we all 
stand with them. 
Ultimately, when you look at the 
supplemental that came through the 
House in May, there were a number of 
Members on the Democrat majority 
side who voted against that supple-
mental who have been vocal about 
defunding the police. 
And, in fact, we have been trying to 
bring up H. Res. 352, which expresses 
support for police in opposition to this 
crazy, radical idea of defunding the po-
lice, where in many of these cities that 
have actually defunded the police, they 
have seen rapid increases in crime. 
Even more—and I know I have held 
roundtables with sheriffs from the New 
Orleans area, as many of my colleagues 
have met with law enforcement—they 
will tell you the biggest challenge 
today, in addition to the growing crime 
wave, they are seeing is a demoraliza-
tion around the country for police be-
cause they see these efforts to defund 
the police and they see elected oficials 
speaking out publicly against police. It 
is not coming from the Republican 
side. I think the gentleman knows 
where it is coming from. 
Why won’t this bill be brought to the 
floor to just express support for police? 
The fact is that the majority on the 
Democrat side will not bring a resolu-
tion to express support for police, H. 
Res. 352, by Ms. MALLIOTAKIS and oth-
ers, at a time when we are seeing 
around the country not only a demor-
alization but an increase in resigna-
tions. People are leaving the great 
work of law enforcement because they 
see in those communities that have 
defunded the police a lack of support. 
Most sheriffs will tell you they are 
having trouble recruiting new people 
right now because of the attacks on po-
lice all around the country that we saw 
from the summer where cops where 
murdered, shot, beaten. Yet a resolu-
tion to express support to let them 
know that we have their back still 
won’t be brought to the floor by this 
majority. 
I hope the gentleman would look at 
bringing H. Res. 352 to the floor so that 
we can actually express to all police 
that we support them and that we do 
have their back. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
You had an opportunity to support 
the police and you voted with those 
who wanted to defund the police. All of 
you had an opportunity, just a few 
weeks ago while we had a bill on the 
floor, to support, to fund the Capitol 
Police to make them safer, more effec-
tive, and better able to enforce the law,

and you all, to a person, voted ‘‘no.’’ 
You had the opportunity, and you 
voted with those who you say on our 
aisle didn’t want to do that. But it 
passed. 
Why did it pass? 
Because 
the 
overwhelming, 
over-
whelming, overwhelming majority of 
Democrats—it is the only reason it 
passed—voted to support the police, 
our Capitol Police. I will tell you that 
is also true of our Members in terms of 
supporting law enforcement at the Fed-
eral, State, and local levels. 
Are there some who say some things? 
Yes. There are some people who say 
some things on your side—I have 
quoted a couple of them—that I am 
sure you don’t support. But having said 
that, the proof is in the eating of the 
pudding. We had a bill on the floor that 
supported the police. You voted against 
it, every one of you. 
Mr. Speaker, you can talk all you 
want about supporting them, but, very 
frankly, the bills you are going to be 
voting on next week support the police. 
They are not defunding. 
Unlike the Trump budgets. If you 
look at the Trump budgets, who cut 
law enforcement funding? 
Trump budgets. 
Check me on that, and then come to 
the floor and say: HOYER is not telling 
the truth. Check me. 
You had an opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, the minority had an op-
portunity to support the police. They 
all voted ‘‘no.’’ The Senate is doing the 
same. It is a shame because it is under-
mining the morale of the Capitol Po-
lice. You have seen that reported in the 
newspapers. This is not me saying it. 
They don’t understand why. 
Mr. SCALISE is absolutely right. The 
Capitol Police have kept him, in par-
ticular, and others who were attacked 
by a crazed, apparently left-wing, but 
crazed bad person, he may be mentally 
defective, but he did a very bad act, 
and he was targeting Republicans. We 
all stood up when Mr. SCALISE was in 
the hospital and thanked the Capitol 
Police for protecting him and others on 
that site. That was a terrible, terrible, 
venal criminal act. The guy was prob-
ably a Democrat. I don’t know. We 
have called him out for being that. 
That is what we ought to all do. 
On January 6, some very bad crimi-
nal people acted in this Congress and in 
this Capitol against our democracy and 
against our Constitution, and we want 
to study it. We want to get the facts so 
it doesn’t happen again and so we know 
who is fomenting this insurrectionist 
psychology and who rationalizes it on 
this floor now. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I will 
just point out that President Biden 
himself a year ago said he supports ef-
forts to divert money away from po-
lice, which, by the way, is the same 
thing as defunding police. If you are di-
verting money away from police, then 
you are defunding police. But, again, 
there is a resolution that has been sit-
ting out there for a while now express-
ing support. I hoped we would bring 
that to the floor and express that sup-
port. 
There are also a number of other 
issues dealing with inflation. We are 
seeing a dramatic increase in inflation 
across this country. Everything some-
one buys when going to a grocery 
store, we are paying more for things 
like eggs and milk. If you try to go on 
a summer vacation right now, you are 
paying over 40 percent more for gaso-
line. You are seeing it across the board, 
and that dramatic increase in inflation 
is a tax. It is a tax on hardworking 
families. 
This chart shows for the gentleman 
so many of those things. Used cars are 
up 45 percent, if you can even find a car 
to buy because there is such a shortage 
when the government is paying people 
not to work. 
The borrowing, by the way, and 
spending of trillions of dollars—which 
are some of the items that are going to 
be coming to the floor next week and 
beyond, trillions more, much of it def-
icit spending—is part of the reason we 
are seeing inflation: gas 45 percent up, 
home prices 15 percent up, milk 5 per-
cent, laundry machines 29 percent, if 
you can get one. You might have to 
wait 6 months to get a washer and 
dryer. 
All of this is a tax on hardworking, 
middle-class families. 
What we should be doing is bringing 
legislation to the floor to confront 
these problems, not to keep spending 
trillions and trillions more in deficit 
spending and higher taxes that ulti-
mately would lead to more evaporation 
of middle-class jobs which is what the 
majority is bringing, but I would hope 
that the gentleman would look at 
working with Republicans on legisla-
tion to start addressing some of these 
problems that are affecting household 
families all across the country. 
b 1145 
Republican, Democrat, Independent, 
doesn’t matter, they are seeing this 
problem, and they would like to see 
this Congress confront it, not make it 
worse with more deficit spending, with 
more multitrillion-dollar spending bills 
and higher taxes that will ship more 
jobs overseas, shutting down energy 
production in America. 
While the President is signing or au-
thorizing agreements with Russia to 
use pipelines to ship their energy to 
other countries, he is shutting down 
pipelines in America so that we can use 
more of our natural resources, again, 
leading to higher prices across the 
board, things that are adversely affect-
ing families. 
I hope we can bring legislation to 
confront these challenges to the floor, 
and I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
We have brought them to the floor. 
We are going to continue to bring them 
to the floor, and we hope Republicans 
support them. 
We created 3 million new jobs; more 
jobs in our first 5 months than any ad-
ministration in history—the gentleman 
forgot to mention that figure—double 
the monthly rates of the 5 months 
prior to that under the Trump adminis-
tration. 
The average number of new unem-
ployment insurance claims has been 
cut in half. Last week, that number 
was about 400,000. The same week last 
year, it was 1.5 million under the 
Trump administration. Small business 
optimism has returned to its 2019 aver-
age. The economy grew at 6.4 percent 
in the first quarter. Independent pro-
jections from CBO, the IMF, the Fed-
eral Reserve, the World Bank, OECD, 
and many others all forecast America 
this year reaching the highest level of 
growth in nearly four decades. 
Furthermore, 
as 
the 
gentleman 
knows, the Director of the Federal Re-
serve has opined that he thinks, yes, 
there is a surge in inflation. Yes, we 
are concerned about it. The Federal 
Reserve is watching it. We are watch-
ing it. We want to keep inflation in 
check. 
The gentleman referenced that we 
are paying people not to work. Let me 
remind the gentleman, we had four 
bills which did similar things which 
were passed in an overwhelming bipar-
tisan fashion last year, overwhelming 
bipartisan fashion, and none of them 
would have become law without the 
signature of President Donald Trump. 
Now what happened? Donald Trump 
left, and bipartisanship left with him; 
not because he was so bipartisan, but 
he thought that what we were doing 
was good for the people, and therefore, 
I think he thought, good politics. I 
think that is accurate. 
The fact is that this economy is now 
doing exactly what we want it to do. It 
is growing. Now it surged. There is no 
doubt about that, and that surge has 
resulted in inflation hiking at a higher 
rate than we would like, including the 
products that the whip mentioned, Mr. 
Speaker. 
We need to contain inflation because 
it does rob those particularly on fixed 
incomes. But the multitrillions that 
were spent last year, one of which, the 
CARES Act spent—was almost a unani-
mous vote in this House—$2 trillion. So 
we did that because we believed that 
the magnitude of the challenge con-
fronting us by COVID–19, both to the 
health of our people and the health of 
our economy, demanded such a robust 
response. 
One of our Members who had been 
vaccinated—some Members hadn’t been 
vaccinated—has come down with it. 
Now, hopefully, the vaccinations that 
he has will moderate any adverse im-
pact of this delta virus. But I would 
say to the gentleman, it is a little bit 
like the commission, that we want to 
focus on the bad news, not focus on the 
good news. The gentleman wants to 
focus on other news, not the central 
news of the insurrection, and I under-
stand that strategy.

H3823 
July 22, 2021 
But there is a lot of good news hap-
pening in America. There is some bad 
news, too. Part of it is because people 
haven’t gotten vaccinated. The gentle-
man’s State has that problem; Mis-
sissippi has that problem; South Caro-
lina and some other States have that 
problem; my State has that problem. 
Not to the extent of some other States, 
but all 50 States are seeing a surge. So 
giving up and getting off the field at 
this point in time is not appropriate. 
I think that we are going to find that 
the President’s program that he sug-
gests, as he says, and I agree, will have 
a generational impact for decades to 
come in making sure that our economy 
continues to grow; that our people are 
educated; that we expand the middle 
class; lift people out of poverty, as we 
did with children who are now 50 per-
cent of them are going to be lifted out 
of poverty. That is good news for 
America. It is good news for all of us. 
Those kids are going to be better edu-
cated and make more productive con-
tributions to our society. 
So I hope a number of Members will 
support pieces of legislation that will 
carry that vision of the President into 
fruition, and we will work toward that 
end. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, as we 
look at those bills coming to the floor 
next week, frankly, they would make 
those problems worse. I know when we 
talk about the inflation side—we talk 
about inflation, because it is the thing 
we hear the most when we talk to our 
constituents back home, because re-
gardless of the statistics, the data is 
little solace if you see your dollar 
going for less further, less far. In fact, 
you see your dollar not going as far be-
cause whatever you are making, you 
are spending even more money than 
you were spending before and waiting 
longer to get things because of these 
policies. 
In fact, the spending itself is part of 
the problem that is leading to infla-
tion. People get that. And so they look 
at these multitrillion-dollar spending 
bills and they are starting to ask the 
questions: What is really in those bills? 
If it is not things to help my family, 
because I am paying more with all of 
this new spending, what is in it? 
We just found out today there are 
millions of dollars in the bill that is 
coming to the floor next week specifi-
cally just for one entity, Planned Par-
enthood of Mar Monte, San Jose, Cali-
fornia; Planned Parenthood, the larg-
est provider of abortions in the coun-
try. So not only is Hyde being dis-
carded, the mutually agreed upon, bi-
partisan, and not just Henry Hyde with 
a few other people. Henry Hyde passed 
this in the 1970s under a Democrat ma-
jority. Democrats and Republicans said 
taxpayer funding shouldn’t be used to 
provide abortions, and it had always 
been sacrosanct in spending bills that 
this Congress passed, Republican and 
Democrat, since that time until now. 
So not only are they gutting Hyde in 
the bill, but they are putting millions 
of dollars into Planned Parenthood by 
name. This is what drives people nuts 
when they see that kind of spending 
and a disconnect because they are pay-
ing more money for regular household 
goods. And instead of us confronting 
that on the floor, they see this kind of 
spending that is generational, because 
it is the next generation that will have 
to pay for it. Because as much as it 
seems this majority wants to raise 
taxes to spend more money, even all 
the taxes that would run more jobs out 
of this country don’t cover all of this 
kind of radical spending. 
I would hope we go a different direc-
tion. We surely will be opposing that 
kind of radical spending and it surely 
won’t be helping those families who 
just want answers, who just want to 
see relief from the problems that they 
are facing. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. It was not 
radical 
spending 
in 
2020, 
because 
Trump signed the bills. Trump left, and 
it became radical spending. That is sit-
uational ethics, Mr. Speaker. I will 
leave it at that. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, the final 
point I would like to bring up to the 
leader, we are seeing something that is 
actually very encouraging in Cuba; 
that is, the people of Cuba taking to 
the streets to demand freedom; some-
thing that has been decades in the 
making. I would hope that we see all 
government leaders, Republican, Dem-
ocrat, executive branch, legislative 
branch, all expressing our support for 
the Cuban people who seek freedom, 
because I think one of the most heart-
felt signs that I know I saw, and so 
many of my colleagues saw just a week 
ago, were not only people taking to the 
streets to call for freedom, they were 
carrying the American flag in Cuba. 
We see this all around the world. It is 
one of the things that for all of our dif-
ferences brings us together, and that is 
that here in the United States Con-
gress, we are not only working to pro-
mote freedom in this country and to 
preserve it for future generations, but 
this freedom that we work to preserve 
inspires people all around the world. 
Whether it is Cuba, or in Iran which we 
saw years ago, or any other country, 
when people seek freedom, there is 
really only one flag that they wave, 
and that is the United States flag. 
Our colleague, MARIO DIAZ-BALART, 
whose family fled Cuba, like so many 
of our colleagues, some first genera-
tion. CARLOS GIMENEZ, former mayor of 
Miami-Dade, personally fled Cuba seek-
ing freedom—and talking about the 
American Dream—he is a first genera-
tion who fled a socialist nation who is 
now a sitting, voting Member of the 
United States Congress, who now wants 
to express support for the Cuban peo-
ple. 
So there is a resolution, H. Res. 527, 
that expresses our solidarity standing 
with the people in Cuba who are seek-
ing freedom. I would just ask the gen-
tleman if he would look at bringing 
that bill to the floor. The people in 
Cuba are trying to get that freedom, 
and they are being heavily oppressed. 
Many may even be being murdered 
right now as they have shut down the 
internet. They shut out the media, be-
cause there is no freedom of the press. 
We are hearing stories that are very 
alarming. If we can express our support 
that we are standing with those people 
in Cuba who do seek freedom as well, I 
think it would be a strong signal. I ask 
the gentleman if we could bring that to 
the floor. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. As he 
knows, the President of the United 
States has strongly expressed support 
of those who are seeking freedom and 
liberty in Cuba. He said that shortly 
after the demonstrations occurred. He 
has maintained that position. I share 
that opinion with him, and we are dis-
cussing what action we might be tak-
ing here in this House. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate that. Hopefully, we can work to-
gether to get that brought to the floor 
and express that support in unison and 
that would send a strong message. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING GOLD STAR FAMILIES 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, as we pre-
pare to bring American troops home 
from Afghanistan, it is important to 
recognize those who weren’t able to 
make it home. 
With that in mind, I rise to honor our 
Nation’s Gold Star families, mothers, 
fathers, husband, wives, siblings, and 
children with a loved one who died in 
service to our country. 
I have deep gratitude for the families 
who have suffered such a painful loss, 
families like that of Captain Joseph 
Schultz, who was killed in action in Af-
ghanistan in 2011. Captain Schultz’s 
mother, Betsy, channeled her grief over 
losing her only child into action, form-
ing a nonprofit respite home for other 
Gold Star families, the Captain Joseph 
House in Port Angeles, Washington. 
The Captain Joseph House, and orga-
nizations like it, provide a network of 
support and comfort for the surviving 
family members. Their work matters, 
and we should be grateful for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I offer my gratitude to 
all who have lost a loved one in service 
to our country.

July 22, 2021 
during appropriation season, of course, 
Democrats and Republicans debate our 
differences, but we have always histori-
cally rallied together in opposition to 
taxpayer-funded 
abortions, 
and 
we 
have 
adopted 
the 
bipartisan 
Hyde 
amendment. 
However, for some inexplicable rea-
son, this year is different. In 1994, then- 
Senator Joe Biden famously stated: 
‘‘Those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ Of course, he was right. But the 
President’s position has changed now, 
giving fuel to the fire of Democrat 
leadership here in this House to follow 
suit in their own funding bills. 
It is time to make these Hyde amend-
ment protections permanent. It is true: 
Hyde saves lives. And today I am ask-
ing my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to recognize the inherent dignity 
of every single human life, rejecting 
this blatant attack on pro-life amend-
ments like the Hyde amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in this 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). Under guidelines consistently 
issued by successive Speakers, as re-
corded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.

b 1200 
STANDING WITH THE CUBAN 
PEOPLE 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Today, Mr. Speaker, I 
stand with the Cuban people in their 
struggle for freedom. 
Today, I ask that the Cuban Govern-
ment respect basic human rights, basic 
religious freedoms, freedom of speech, 
freedom of association, and the free-
dom to be heard. 
Today, I ask that the Cuban Govern-
ment listen to the plight of the Cuban 
people. 
Deteriorating living conditions, ris-
ing healthcare concerns, COVID–19, all 
of these factors have left the Cuban 
people hungry, vulnerable, and very 
angry. 
That is why, after decades of repres-
sion, thousands of brave men and 
women, especially young people, have 
taken to the streets of Cuba, marching 
to be heard, demanding that the Cuban 
Government respond to their pleas for 
help. 
Instead, the Cuban Government has 
responded by halting internet access 
and beating and arresting Cuban citi-
zens that are calling for freedom. 
In Havana alone, the Cuban Govern-
ment has attacked protesters and ar-
rested more than 100 young people. 
If the Government of Cuba wants to 
normalize relations with the United 
States, the first thing the Cuban Gov-
ernment has to do is to respect human 
rights and religious freedoms. 
f 
STANDING AGAINST THE CASTRO 
REGIME 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of the Cuban 
people and against the illegitimate, 
violent dictatorship that continues to 
assault the basic freedoms and rights 
of the Cuban people. 
This photo here behind me is of two 
of my heroes, my abuelo and abuela. In 
1960, they and their children were 
forced from their homeland by the 
communist regime for having the au-
dacity to say no to Castro and his 
thugs. 
Sixty years later, that same regime 
and that same poisonous ideology 
wreak terror on the Cuban people as 
the people march courageously in the 
streets, knowing full well what bru-
tality awaits them as they ask for the 
most basic of human rights. 
Yet, there are some in this body who 
foolishly wish to blame America for 
the plight of the island and the suf-
fering of the Cubans. Let me say em-
phatically that the Cuban people are 
suffering and crying out for freedom 
because the communists have spent 60 
years cynically destroying their coun-
try and trying to break the spirit of 
their own people. They will not suc-
ceed. 
I stand firmly against the Castro re-
gime and any of their apologists, and I 
stand with the Cuban people who are 
crying out for freedom. 
f 
PROTECTING VULNERABLE 
POPULATIONS 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, through-
out my career, I have worked to pro-
tect vulnerable populations. 
Yesterday, I was proud to support the 
Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act, which will aim to protect ex-
ploited consumers, including the elder-
ly, who are oftentimes the most at 
risk. 
The Federal Trade Commission has 
an essential role to safeguard con-
sumers from businesses that utilize 
misleading and deceptive practices. 
These bad actors must be held account-
able, and the victims of any scam de-
serve justice. 
I appreciate the leadership of the 
House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee to ensure that the FTC has the 
capabilities it needs to protect all indi-
viduals from fraud. 
I encourage our Senate colleagues to 
consider this important legislation as 
soon as possible. 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, nearly 20 
years ago, I introduced legislation in 
this House, which passed the House and 
the Senate. President George W. Bush 
signed it into law, and it went all the 
way to the U.S. Supreme Court and 
now is the law of the land. It banned 
partial-birth abortion in this country. 
While that was landmark legislation, 
today, it is more important than ever 
that we protect innocent unborn life. 
That is why, a little over a month 
ago, the city of Lebanon in my con-
gressional district back home became 
one of more than 30 cities across the 
country, and the first in Ohio, to be-
come a sanctuary city for the unborn. 
It is why I have consistently and en-
thusiastically 
supported 
legislation 
which would get rid of the funding for 
Planned Parenthood and its affiliates 
and supported legislation like H.R. 18, 
which codifies the Hyde amendment to 
ensure that Federal taxpayer money 
does not fund abortions. 
And it is why, Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, and I ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
We should not allow tax dollars to go 
for funding other people’s abortions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). As the Chair previously ad-
vised, that request cannot be enter-
tained absent appropriate clearance. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE PLAGUES OUR 
COUNTRY 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the gun violence 
plaguing this country and the elected 
officials who stand by and watch, con-
tent on not passing new laws to address 
its scourge on the American people. 
I rise for the 9-year anniversary of 
the mass shooting that took place in a 
movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, 9 
years ago this week—12 lives gone, 70 
injured. 
I rise for all of those who were at the 
baseball game just this last weekend 
around the corner, running for their 
lives because they heard there was a 
shooting. 
Your gun rights are not under attack 
when 23 million firearms were sold in 
the United States of America in 2020 
alone. But what is under attack is your 
ability to live freely in this country 
without the threat of gun violence in a 
movie theater, in your place of wor-
ship, in your school, in your backyard, 
or driving around at night.

REMEMBERING HERB HEILBRUN 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, this 
past December, America lost another 
hero from our Greatest Generation, 
Herb Heilbrun. 
Born and raised in Cincinnati, Herb 
enlisted in the Army Air Corps after 
the attack on Pearl Harbor. He flew 35 
missions during World War II, where he 
earned the Distinguished Flying Cross 
for saving the lives of his crew after his 
plane was hit. 
Following the war, Herb returned to 
Cincinnati, where he worked in sales 
and real estate before being named 
president of the Cincinnati Board of 
Realtors in 1970. 
Herb’s service did not stop after the 
war. Herb Heilbrun devoted the later 
years of his life to traveling our great 
United States of America with his best 
friend, 
a 
fellow 
Cincinnatian 
and 
Tuskegee airman named Johnny Leahr. 
They reached out to teach students the 
importance of respect, racial tolerance, 
and friendship. 
Herb was truly a beloved member of 
our community. Always appearing at 
veterans’ events, proudly in his uni-
form, he passed away at the age of 100. 
It was a privilege for me to call Herb 
Heilbrun my friend. May we all honor 
him for his life of service and dedica-
tion to our country, to his community, 
and to his family. May he rest in peace. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill 
to rename a post office in Avondale 
after Herb and John, and I urge the 
House to pass it without delay. 
f 
HONORING HAZEL ERBY, BETTY 
THOMPSON, AND HENRY GIVENS, 
JR. 
(Ms. BUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise today with heavy hearts. 
Since the beginning of July, we have 
lost three civil rights giants in our 
community: Ms. Hazel Erby, Ms. Betty 
Thompson, and Dr. Henry Givens, Jr. 
Mama Hazel and Mama Betty were 
trailblazers, breaking down barriers for 
Black women and all Black people to 
be leaders in St. Louis and beyond. I 
would not be Missouri’s first Black 
Congresswoman without the doors that 
they opened up for me. 
Dr. Henry Givens, Jr., led Harris- 
Stowe State University for 32 years. 
His 
leadership 
transformed 
Harris- 
Stowe, the university I attended, from 
a small college with just one building 
into the nationally acclaimed HBCU 
that it is today. 
We will miss them all dearly, but to-
gether, we are St. Louis strong. We will 
carry their work forward to build a 
more just future for all of us. 
f 
REOPEN U.S.-CANADA BORDER 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the Biden administration an-
nounced that it would once again ex-
tend the U.S.-Canada border closure for 
nonessential travel until August 21. 
This is yet another example of the 
President’s failure on this issue. His 
second day in office, he signed an exec-
utive order calling for a plan. That 
never happened. 
We have sent multiple letters from 
my office calling for answers. They 
have gone unanswered. 
Reporters have asked for clarity. The 
White House has dodged. 
Families and small businesses have 
pleaded for action so they can reunite 
and recoup lost revenue. They have 
been ignored. 
Canada has announced that they will 
allow fully vaccinated Americans in 
the country starting in August. This is 
long overdue but still light years ahead 
of our President. 
This extension is unacceptable, ig-
nores the science, and extends the suf-
fering of families and small businesses 
in my region. 
Reopening 
the 
border 
for 
non-
essential travel can be done safely. The 
time for stalling and silence has long 
passed. The Biden administration needs 
to act immediately and reopen our 
shared border. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, as elected 
Representatives, we are obligated to 
handle taxpayer dollars in a manner 
that is both responsible and above re-
proach. 
For 
decades, 
legislators, 
through provisions such as the Hyde 
amendment, have rightfully shielded 
hardworking citizens’ tax dollars from 
the unethical practice of abortion. 
However, countless legislative pro-
posals this Congress prove that my col-
leagues across the aisle are not inter-
ested in preserving vital pro-life, good 
government provisions upon which our 
constituents depend, as they have in-
tentionally 
eliminated 
the 
Hyde 
amendment at every opportunity. By 
removing pro-life provisions like Hyde, 
we are subjecting the American people 
to funding practices that violate the 
sanctity of life. 
I could speak at length about the 
horrors of abortion, but the simple fact 
of the matter is this: Taxpayer dollars 
should never financially support abor-
tion, and we should always protect the 
conscience rights of our constituents. 
As such, Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committees on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce, 
Ways 
and

EXTREME DROUGHT IN 
MINNESOTA 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, most 
of Minnesota is in extreme drought, 
and many of our farmers are facing a 
tremendous hardship. 
There are reports that herd culling is 
already being done around the region 
due to the lack of quality feed, and 
farmers will soon be forced to make 
impossible decisions regarding their 
crops and livestock. 
The situation is serious and demands 
our attention. I have asked the admin-
istration to allow emergency haying 
and grazing on CRP lands now, but 
that request was met with silence. 
If the drought continues to worsen, 
and if the administration does not act, 
the impacts on our economy will be 
far-reaching. 
In the meantime, I stand ready to as-
sist my constituents in navigating 
these challenges and working toward 
quick recovery.

WE NEED TO REIN IN SPENDING 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about rising inflation and 
the burden this is having on American 
taxpayers. 
President Biden promised not to 
raise taxes on middle-class Americans, 
but the rising price of essentials like 
groceries, gas, and appliances are mak-
ing our paychecks worth less. 
Gas prices are up 45.1 percent. 
In my home State of California, gas 
is more than $1 higher than the na-
tional average. We already pay some of 
the highest taxes in the country. 
And make no mistake, this inflation 
is a hidden tax on every single Amer-
ican. 
Despite these rising costs that Amer-
ican families are paying the price for, 
President Biden has insisted that the 
solution is to spend trillions more. 
American families are going to con-
tinue feeling the consequences as long 
as President Biden’s reckless tax-and- 
spending spree continues. We need to 
rein in spending and lower taxes for

HONORING ANTONIO ‘‘TONY’’ 
RANGEL 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Antonio ‘‘Tony’’ 
Rangel, a longtime veteran from the 
city of Placentia, who is now the name-
sake of American Legion Post 277. 
Mr. Rangel served in the United 
States Army during the Korean war 
and has spent more than half of his life 
as a member of the American Legion. 
Mr. Rangel has not only served our 
Nation, but also has long been a pillar 
of our Placentia community. He was 
named Placentia Citizen of the Year in 
1989 and continues to live up to that 
title each and every day. 
It is only fitting that the Post 277 
building 
is 
officially 
the 
Antonio 
‘‘Tony’’ Rangel Hall. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rangel for 
his service to our country and to Cali-
fornia’s 39th Congressional District. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I want to thank 
my good friend from the State of Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT.) It is always a pleasure 
to be with him. 
Today I want to talk about some-
thing that is near and dear to all of us. 
Maybe I am exaggerating when I say 
dear to all of us. But I am referring to 
a Federal agency that at one time 
former Senator Orrin Hatch described 
as the most feared Federal agency in 
our country. I am talking about the 
IRS; I am talking about right now the 
operations of the IRS. 
In recent months we have learned 
that the agency has yet to process mil-
lions and millions of tax returns filed 
over the past 3 years. People across 
this country have been waiting to re-
ceive money that is theirs far longer 
than is reasonable. The agency should 
be working night and day to catch up. 
I want to take this opportunity also 
to thank my friends on both sides of 
the aisle, because for most people in 
our districts, we are the IRS. We are 
the people answering those tough ques-
tions and helping them navigate in an 
almost impossible Federal agency in 
order to get things done. 
Now, at the same time as this back-
log persists, the agency is doing things 
that take us back to the last time that 
Mr. Biden was in the White House, and 
we have returned to those bad, old, 
dark days of the Obama administration 
when Lois Lerner and her cronies were 
targeting conservative, nonprofit orga-
nizations because of their political 
views. 
Just weeks ago, the IRS was caught 
red-handed, once again. In a letter de-
clining a nonprofit status to a Chris-
tian organization, the agency decried 
biblical teachings as a nonneutral, po-
litically oriented form of speech. These 
bureaucrats had the audacity to say 
that the organization’s Bible teachings 
about the Christian faith, which are 
shared by millions upon millions of 
Americans of all different political 
views, were too aligned with the Re-
publican Party to warrant nonprofit 
status. 
Now, upon learning of this shameful 
decision, my friend from Texas, KEVIN 
BRADY, and I joined Americans across 
this country to demand answers as to 
how the IRS could come to such an 
egregious conclusion. Thankfully, and 
only because of this oversight and the 
exposure to what happened, our legisla-
tive oversight and the public’s right-
eous indignation caused this agency to 
reverse its course; but, again, only be-
cause of our oversight and the exposure 
to what was actually taking place 
within this agency. 
This IRS needs more oversight and 
accountability if we are to expect it to 
do the right thing. But the one thing I 
want to explain to all of our citizens 
across the country, if you get a call 
from the IRS, understand that that 
call is not from the IRS. The IRS will 
only contact you by mail. When I go 
home, and I think all of my colleagues 
are the same, I hear people tell me, 
‘‘The IRS called me.’’ I say, ‘‘That is 
not the IRS. That is a scam.’’ 
But you know what? There are things 
we have to do. We have not only an ob-
ligation, we have a responsibility to 
improve all Federal agencies. 
Now, it is sad to say that the only 
scandal entangling the IRS this year 
isn’t the one I just talked about. In an 
outrageous criminal act, someone, ei-
ther 
inside 
or 
outside 
the 
IRS, 
breached IRS systems and leaked the 
confidential tax records of thousands 
and thousands of Americans to a left- 
wing propaganda outlet, Pro Publica, 
which proceeded to publish these pri-
vate financial details in pursuit of a 
political narrative on tax policy. 
This is an astonishing breach of trust 
that should cause every American to 
wonder if his or her own tax informa-
tion could be weaponized against them. 
It is not farfetched. When President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
tax 
returns 
were 
leaked to The New York Times last 
year, I noted that if this could happen 
to the President of the United States, 
it could happen to any American. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, here we are. In 
2019, the late Representative John 
Lewis and I worked together to figure 
out how we could reform the IRS so 
that it would better serve our tax-
payers. We worked as friends, set aside 
any political differences we may have 
had, and authored the Taxpayer First 
Act, which was passed with over-
whelming support from this entire Con-
gress and signed into law by President 
Trump 2 years ago in July of 2019. 
The primary intent of this legislation 
was to make the IRS a customer-serv-
ice-oriented agency. Our tax system is 
a voluntary system. After all, this is 
one of the few Federal entities that 
Americans will interact with consist-
ently for their entire lives. From their 
birth until their death they will have 
actions within the IRS. 
There are few things more intimi-
dating than having to resolve a dispute 
with the IRS, so making it a resource 
rather than an adversary was our chief 
aim. That is what we were trying to 
get to. 
But how can an agency that takes 
years to process tax returns, leaks pri-
vate financial records to damage cer-
tain taxpayers, and wields its vast 
power to punish people or organiza-
tions with certain political or religious 
views be seen as anything other than 
an adversary? 
The IRS is one of the most powerful 
forces in our lives. I have heard this so 
many times when I go back home, and 
I am sure you have heard it, and I am 
sure most Americans feel the same 
way: People tell me, ‘‘I don’t mind pay-
ing my taxes as long as those moneys 
that I put in get used the right way, 
but I do fear the agency with which I 
have to interact.’’ 
Let’s work together to hold this 
agency accountable. It is not all mem-
bers of the IRS who we are criticizing 
or who we are looking at right now. We 
are talking about certain things that 
happen within that agency that abso-
lutely are terrifying to the average 
American. 
We, as a body, representing everyone 
in this country, need to take a look at 
where it is that we are failing and 
where it is that this agency has failed 
and why it has become such an intimi-
dating agency. 
If you want to restore the faith in 
any of our agencies or any of the 
things that we do in our life, you do it 
by actually working within the frame-
work of that agency and looking at 
what we can do as the personal rep-
resentatives of the American people to 
cure the situation as it is now and 
make the IRS a service-based agency 
and not one of intimidation. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate so much those observations. It is 
so important for everybody to under-
stand, the IRS is feared, and we learn 
through people like Lois Lerner that it 
is not always honest, and yet nobody 
has been held to account. I am hoping 
that at some point that will occur. I 
am so grateful to my friend from Penn-
sylvania. 
At this time I yield to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to call the Nation’s attention to a trag-
ic event unfolding in my State of Or-
egon, the horrifically destructive Boot-
leg fire.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3827 
July 22, 2021 
This fire, now the third largest in my 
State’s history, has consumed some 
400,000 acres. That is about 660 square 
miles of previously beautiful land-
scape, pine, fir, sagebrush, grass, and 
meadows. The fire has taken millions 
of board feet of timber, the lives of 
thousands of forest creatures, cattle by 
the dozens, if not hundreds, horses, 
fences, buildings, and homes. The fire 
has released hundreds of thousands of 
tons of carbon, which could have re-
mained sequestered far into the future. 
The smoke plume created by this con-
flagration has reached across this Na-
tion, more than 2,000 miles, to pollute 
the air across the U.S., reaching finally 
the East Coast, including the air right 
here in Washington, D.C. 
I have spoken with people whose 
homes and ranches were in the path of 
this fire. It moved so fast they could 
not gather and remove their cattle in 
time to save them. They have been 
sending me pictures of animals that 
have perished and pictures of many 
others who had to be put down because 
of injuries they suffered from the 
flames from which they could not es-
cape. These are truly some of the sad-
dest photos I have ever seen. 
How did we get here? Fires happen 
naturally in our Western forests. They 
have always been a part of the Western 
landscape. These fires used to burn low 
to the ground at relatively low tem-
peratures. Underbrush, vegetation, and 
smaller trees would burn, and in what 
were normal times, larger trees would 
survive. 
Then about 100 years ago, our Nation 
decided to put out and suppress these 
fires. For years the trees and brush 
that grew unabated by fire were re-
duced to some extent by logging activi-
ties then allowed in our forests. 
In the 1970s, forests saw the begin-
ning of a steep reduction in forest man-
agement, and our forests began to grow 
unnaturally dense. Federal regulations 
decimated the timber industry, leaving 
more and more trees and brush on our 
Federal lands. The fires, fueled by this 
huge amount of ever-increasing woody 
mass, grew in their ferocity and dan-
ger. And now, after years of fire sup-
pression and woefully inadequate forest 
management, we are paying the price. 
The horrific infernos we are seeing 
out West are not the fires of centuries 
past. These terrifying, out-of-control 
wildfires become so immense, they 
often start burning from the top of the 
trees, not from the underbrush, leaping 
from treetop to treetop, causing the 
fire to travel faster and burn hotter. 
The blame for our forests’ deplorable 
and dangerous condition does not be-
long to any one person or group. How-
ever, I must call out the massive spe-
cial-interest 
lawsuit 
industry 
that 
profits from the operation of the Equal 
Access 
to 
Justice 
Act 
by 
legally 
kneecapping almost every attempt to 
manage our Western forests. 
b 1230 
So what is the long-term solution? 
We are seeing some early evidence that 
managed forests fared far better than 
did forests that were not thinned or 
otherwise treated in anticipation of the 
fires that are sure to come. Fire-
fighters on the ground indicated that 
thinned areas slowed down the fires so 
that firefighters had a fighting chance 
to bring the fire in those areas under 
control. 
This is good news because it means 
there is some hope. There is a way out 
of this if Congress can find the political 
will to work toward a solution. 
I am pleased to report I am working 
with 
ranking 
member 
BRUCE 
WESTERMAN, whose Resilient Federal 
Forests Act will be a huge step toward 
giving the Forest Service the tools it 
needs to better manage our vast public 
lands. 
In fact, today, I introduced legisla-
tion included in that package, the 
Commonsense Coordination Act. This 
bill will cut through some of the red 
tape that agencies must overcome to 
complete critical forest management 
activities. 
I express my sympathy to the people 
suffering from the Bootleg fire and all 
the fires across the West. My staff and 
I have been on nonstop calls with local 
officials, county commissioners, and 
ranchers. The experiences they are 
sharing are incredibly sad and made 
more so by the fact that we could have 
done so much better when it came to 
protecting our Nation’s forests and 
those that live in and around them. I 
will continue to do all I can here in 
Congress to help. 
Lastly, I thank all the brave men and 
women who are out fighting the fires, 
including firefighters, farmers, ranch-
ers, helicopter pilots and others. This 
is hot, dirty, difficult, and dangerous 
work, but their tireless efforts are sav-
ing lives, homes, forests, wildlife, live-
stock, and property. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. BENTZ, and I have to give a shout- 
out to BRUCE WESTERMAN as the rank-
ing member on the Natural Resources 
Committee. This very morning, we had 
a Republican group, but we couldn’t 
get the whole committee to do it on 
that very issue of forest fires and main-
taining healthy forests. 
Hopefully, we will get the majority 
to understand it is not enough to just 
let nature take its course. You trim 
the undergrowth. You have fire lanes 
so you can stop a fire when it gets 
started. There are so many things that 
Republicans understand is just good 
forest management. 
So whether it is lightning or some-
thing else that starts a fire, we don’t 
have to see 400,000 acres go up in 
flames. This administration is deter-
mined not to do proper management of 
the forests, and so many people get 
hurt. 
I am proud to have a colleague like 
Mr. BENTZ that will stand up for what 
is best for forests, for nature, and has a 
lot of common sense in the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Encounters at the southern border 
have reached a 20-year high of now over 
one million illegals trying to smuggle 
themselves into our country. This 
proves that the Biden administration’s 
immigration policies are not working 
and that they have reignited a crisis at 
our southern border previously con-
tained by the Trump administration. 
In fact, the border crisis is getting so 
bad that States not even geographi-
cally connected to the border are feel-
ing the effects. 
Just last week I was traveling down 
I–24 East from Nashville, Tennessee, to 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, and larger 
than day was this huge yellow bill-
board that said: ‘‘CRISIS, Biden Fix 
the Border.’’ The problems are drugs, 
cartels, and illegals. This was not some 
political party that put up that bill-
board, it was organic. It was home-
grown right from the heart of the 
American people. The message is crys-
tal clear, and America should stand up 
and take notice. 
So why am I seeing this sign in Ten-
nessee, a State that has no connection 
to the southern border? It is because 
the Biden administration is flying 
illegals to every State in the Union 
making every State a border State. 
This must stop. 
Further complicating the crisis, the 
Biden administration is considering 
the elimination of title 42, a Centers 
for Disease Control public health au-
thority that allows border officials to 
turn back illegal migrants due to the 
danger posed by communicable dis-
eases. 
By doing this, the Biden administra-
tion is not only preventing U.S. border 
officials from doing their jobs, but un-
necessarily exposing American citizens 
to the dangers of COVID–19. 
Since the beginning of the crisis, the 
Biden administration’s reckless poli-
cies implemented by executive order 
have been exposing communities to 
COVID–19 by refusing to test every ille-
gal migrant that is apprehended. 
Even Secretary Mayorkas himself ad-
mitted to me in a committee hearing 
that his agency has released illegals 
into the interior of the United States 
who are known to be infected with 
COVID–19. Local communities are then 
forced to deal with it. 
This is simply unacceptable. 
For these reasons I introduced H.R. 
2076, the COVID–19 Border Protection 
Act. My bipartisan legislation requires 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
in 
consultation 
with 
Health 
and 
Human Services, to develop a com-
prehensive strategy to test illegals 
that are encountered at the border and 
quarantine those who test positive. 
With the rise of the new COVID–19 
delta variant, it is critical that every 
illegal alien who crosses the border be 
tested. 
H.R. 2076 has bipartisan support and 
41 cosponsors, including the support of 
all the GOP Members of the House 
Homeland Security Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3828 
July 22, 2021 
I will continue to push this effort to 
safeguard the American people and will 
soon introduce an amendment to the 
fiscal year 2022 DHS appropriations 
that will help accomplish the goals of 
H.R. 2076. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this legislation. I 
thank my good friend and colleague 
from Texas for holding this very impor-
tant Special Order. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend from Georgia so much 
for making the effort to stand up for 
the constitutional rights of Members of 
Congress not to be detained from get-
ting onto the House floor. We have 
metal detectors still at each entrance. 
We didn’t used to have them at the 
Speaker’s 
lobby. 
Those 
have 
been 
added. 
We are co-plaintiffs in a lawsuit that 
will, hopefully, result in those being re-
moved so that we won’t continue to 
have Republicans miss votes because 
they get detained, even for the short 
time, when the Speaker has full discre-
tion as to when to bring down the 
gavel. We have had a number of Repub-
licans who have missed votes that they 
would not have missed were there no 
metal detectors, and especially since 
there is no intelligence from any 
source of any Member being a threat to 
another Member then this totally un-
precedented 
subjugating 
of 
House 
Members below what their roles are 
and being sent by the same number of 
people that sent the Speaker. 
It is time to get rid of the metal de-
tectors, get rid of the subjugation and 
get back to the Nation’s business. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to say I am so 
excited about the freshman class that 
came in this Congress. We just heard 
from three freshmen, and these are 
folks, especially including my friend 
from Florida, KAT CAMMACK, that has 
been added, and I am thrilled. I have 
been so reassured by the freshman 
class that has come in and the common 
sense that came with them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. It is an honor and a privilege 
to serve alongside Representative GOH-
MERT, and I look forward to many more 
conversations on so many different 
topics, and I thank him for allowing 
me to be part of this Special Order 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up 
for and in support of our Border Patrol 
agents, our National Guard, the offi-
cers of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety, our local law enforcement offi-
cers protecting our hometowns, and all 
those that have made securing our bor-
der their mission. 
In fact, my own Florida National 
Guard and several of our Florida offi-
cers and deputies have become part of 
the mission to secure our southwest 
border. For our Border Patrol agents, 
they have been trained to do a job that 
this administration will not let them 
do. They have dedicated their lives and 
careers to upholding the rule of law, 
something that this administration 
will not do. 
They have continually put them-
selves in harm’s way, keeping their 
heads down and continuing to follow 
orders. And their reward to date? Well, 
just look at the facts. Look at the 
numbers. 
Approximately 40 percent of our Bor-
der Patrol agents are babysitting and 
processing, not patrolling, not secur-
ing, and certainly not defending the 
homeland because that is not their 
mission today. 
Eleven agents are currently in the 
hospital fighting COVID from contact 
with untested migrants, three of whom 
are 
in 
the 
ICU 
today; 
two 
are 
intubated. 
Just last month, the month of June, 
Border 
Patrol 
agents 
apprehended 
188,829 migrants. Let me repeat that: 
188,829 migrants. That is the highest 
number in over 21 years. It is stag-
gering. It is shocking. And it should 
frighten every single American today. 
And that doesn’t even include the 
got-aways. The got-aways are the peo-
ple actively seeking to avoid detection 
by Border Patrol or National Guard or 
Texas DPS or any number of resources 
and assets that we have on the border. 
The got-aways right now are about 
200,000. And these are just the folks 
that have been seen by an agent or 
caught on camera running away. These 
are the people who are criminals, reg-
istered sex offenders, gang members, 
cartel members. These are people who 
are now in our country and we don’t 
know where, doing God knows what. 
And, of course, let’s not forget the 
drugs, the narcotics that have been 
seized at the border but also the ones 
that have made it across. You know, 
just in the month of June the fentanyl 
seized—keep in mind, only 20 percent is 
what they estimate is caught coming 
across 
the 
border—the 
amount 
of 
fentanyl in pounds, over a thousand, is 
enough to kill every man, woman, and 
child in the State of Florida 10 times 
over. And that was just in the month of 
June. And that was just fentanyl. That 
doesn’t include the cocaine, the heroin, 
the meth, the weed, and any other nar-
cotics that come. 
When you talk about the money that 
is being made by the cartels every sin-
gle month, last month, based on the 
number of apprehensions, that 188,829 
that were apprehended, on average, 
each one of those paid the cartels 
$6,000. You do the math. That is over $1 
billion in human smuggling. Human 
smuggling. That doesn’t include the 
narcotics. And believe me, as those 
narcotics get across the border and 
into our communities, they get more 
expensive and more valuable, and the 
crime and violence that comes along 
with them gets bigger and tougher and 
scarier. 
The numbers are pretty staggering, 
and as we stand here, I mentioned the 
agents that are currently in the hos-
pital fighting for their lives because 
they came into contact with people 
who come from countries that don’t 
test, don’t vaccinate, and now today we 
have a 900 percent increase in COVID 
cases along the southwest border. 900 
percent. 
And you know what happens? 
These people are not tested. They are 
checked for lice and scabies, and then 
on our taxpayer dime they are released 
into our country. 
For all of our Border Patrol agents, I 
want to say, I am sorry. I am sorry 
that this administration does not have 
your back. I am sorry that those on the 
left don’t have your back. But please 
know that my colleagues and I, we al-
ways will. 
Let me be clear: This is not about 
legal immigration. This is about fight-
ing against illegal immigration and the 
criminals who are profiting off of it. 
Now, as we stand here laying down 
the facts of this crisis—and it is, in 
fact, a crisis, despite the fact that this 
administration cannot call it that— 
Americans around the country are 
probably wondering how this affects 
them. They are outraged, sure, but how 
are they impacted in their daily lives 
in their communities? 
I have to tell you, every town in 
America is a border town. The nearly 
one million individuals apprehended to 
date for this year are coming to our 
hometowns. 
In Florida, they estimate that 70 per-
cent of the migrants that are coming 
across are coming to Florida. Seventy 
percent are bound for my home State 
of Florida. Yes, every town in America 
is a border town. 
And you ask, how are they getting to 
our hometowns? On our dime. 
The NGOs have government con-
tracts. They buy plane tickets and bus 
tickets, and then they submit reim-
bursement from FEMA on our dime in 
our hometowns unchecked, unvetted, 
and coming to a town near you. Every 
town in America is a border town. 
And as they are on these planes, do 
they have to show ID? No. No, they do 
not, because TSA has special guidance 
that these people are not subject to the 
same requirements that every other 
American is when they board an air-
plane. 
b 1245 
They do not have to show photo ID. 
They do not have to prove who they 
say they are. Yes, every town in Amer-
ica is a border town now. 
And you wonder what happens when 
these folks get to our hometowns? 
They use taxpayer-funded schools, tax-
payer-funded medical facilities, public 
safety resources. The list goes on and 
on. It is about enough to make you 
sick. 
Now when the left decides that tak-
ing care of unvetted, untested, and to-
tally dependent illegals is totally more 
important than taking care of our vet-
erans and some of our homeless vet-
erans, I think that is when we, as

Americans, and particularly, ‘‘us,’’ my 
colleagues, 
Republicans 
and 
Demo-
crats, need to stand up and say enough. 
Enough is enough. The left’s agenda is 
dangerous. 
Clearly, they have turned every town 
in America into a border town and 
defunded our police along the way. The 
very people who are fighting to protect 
our hometowns. Drugs, crime—bring it 
on, they say. Never mind the 93,000 
Americans that lost their lives to 
drugs just last year. 
Mr. Speaker, I recently took about 
six sheriffs from my home State to the 
border. I wanted my sheriffs in my 
area, to see exactly what they were up 
against, because when there is a leak, 
you can mop all day long, but until you 
fix the leak, the water will just keep 
coming. And they saw firsthand really 
what is at stake. Our country is at 
stake. And they said, right out the 
gate, every town now I see is a border 
town. And let me be exceptionally 
clear, that you cannot protect your 
hometown if you cannot defend the 
homeland, and that starts with secur-
ing the damn border. 
Yes, stopping this influx of crime and 
drugs and illegal activity starts with 
securing our border. But if the crime 
and the drugs, the negative impacts to 
our hometowns, our country, our soci-
ety, our culture, our kids, if the lack of 
support for our agents isn’t enough to 
convince every single one of my col-
leagues to take action, then perhaps 
the horrific humanitarian crisis un-
folding is; the trafficking of children, 
maybe that is what it takes to inspire 
action from those on the left. 
Next here to me today you see this 
photo. This is a photo of a 3-year-old 
little girl. I took this photo on April 11 
at 1:46 p.m., standing just outside 
McAllen at the border. The man hold-
ing her told us—standing right there as 
he was being processed in the field— 
that that was his little girl. He 
couldn’t tell me her name, and she was 
so scared, she couldn’t even tell me her 
name, or anyone else with us. The man 
told me and my colleagues that he and 
his daughter had been traveling for 2 
months. 
Mr. Speaker, 12 hours later while 
standing in the Donna processing fa-
cilities, Border Patrol agents who had 
processed and conducted an interview 
with this man, told us that when they 
had threatened a rapid DNA test on 
him because red flags kept popping up 
in his story, that he admitted that that 
little girl—this little girl—was not his 
daughter. 
She was someone else’s daughter; 
someone who was willing to let their 
child be used, trafficked—and in this 
case, it is called recycling. Because 
this administration has policies that 
encourage children under the age of six 
to be recycled, where they get matched 
up with criminals so that they can be 
escorted across the border. That man— 
this man—was turned back. 
This little girl today is somewhere in 
the United States in the custody of 
HHS away from her family, future un-
known. Her story is not unique. This is 
a regular occurring event; the recy-
cling of children. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues: 
Are you okay with the recycling of 
children? Is this administration okay 
with the recycling and trafficking of 
children? 
It is disgusting. 
As I said, there are stories like this 
that go on for days. I, myself, met a 9- 
year-old little girl who couldn’t barely 
get the words out to tell me her name 
and where she was from, because her 
vocal cords had given out from scream-
ing so loud, because she was being 
gang-raped by the cartels. If that 
doesn’t make your stomach turn, I 
don’t know what will. 
President Biden, your administration 
has proven that while your words are 
dangerous, your actions are deadly. 
Your administration has turned every 
single town in America into a border 
town, and every American should be 
outraged at their carelessness, the lack 
of regard for public health, public safe-
ty, national security, and basic human 
decency. 
Mr. Speaker, securing the border is 
not a Republican or a Democrat issue. 
This is an American issue, and it 
should be our top priority. We need to 
extend title 42. We need to reinstate 
the MPP policies. Put the politics and 
the egos aside and do what is best for 
our country for the first time in this 
administration. 
Until then, for myself and my col-
leagues, who actually give a damn, we 
will continue to craft legislation and 
put the words into action, and do the 
thing that the majority and President 
Biden won’t do, secure the border. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend, Member of Congress, 
KAT CAMMACK. She has expressed so 
articulately what I have seen, what I 
have experienced so many times spend-
ing the night on the border, going down 
those dirt roads along the Rio Grande. 
It is incredible. 
And some would think, Oh, well, isn’t 
it compassionate to encourage people 
to come to the United States. It is the 
most unneighborly, uncompassionate 
thing that we could do. These are peo-
ple who—other than the gang members, 
those who are part of the cartels, those 
coming from groups in the Middle East 
and other places that don’t have U.S. 
interests at heart, but so many of 
them, they are looking for a better way 
of life. 
Why do they not have a better way of 
life where they are, including, espe-
cially, Mexico? Well, it is because of 
the unsecured border we have that al-
lows the Mexican drug cartels to make 
tens of billions of dollars every year 
coming from America for the drugs, for 
the fentanyl that kills, for the sex traf-
ficking, for the human trafficking. We 
are funding the corruption in Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, when my wife and I had 
our honeymoon, we didn’t have much 
money at all; $300 got us 5 nights, 6 
days in a fabulous place in Mexico. But 
we don’t go back because the drug car-
tels no longer say hands off of the tour-
ism. 
Mexico is being devastated by the 
drug cartels. And it is America and ad-
ministrations like this that are allow-
ing them—actually making it pos-
sible—not just allowing, making it pos-
sible. Some might say they are truly 
accessories to the corruption, to the 
criminality that is going on. 
And in fact, evidence of that comes 
from the fact that as border patrol had 
told me before, before this administra-
tion when they used to talk to me and 
never ever tried to prevent me from 
getting to the border and seeing ex-
actly what is going on—that has all 
changed now. This administration did 
not allow me, two nights in a row, try-
ing to get to the border, as I have done 
countless times before—wouldn’t let 
me get there. In fact, used the place 
where normally you get down from the 
embankment, go through the wall that 
is being constructed by the Trump ad-
ministration, go down through the flat 
area, and then you come up to the 
levee road, and then that allows you to 
get miles and miles down the dirt roads 
along the Rio Grande where thousands 
of people are coming across. 
And they didn’t allow it this time. 
They used the wall, not to keep out il-
legal aliens, but to keep me from see-
ing the outrageous travesties and trag-
edies that are going along our border, 
because people are being lured to their 
detriment. In tort law, it would be 
called an attractive nuisance; like hav-
ing a swimming pool and having no 
fence so that a child is drawn in and 
then drowns. 
Well, this administration is luring 
people to their detriment. And I have 
been there many nights, it is not on 
the list of questions that is required to 
be asked, but so often the border patrol 
asks, How much did you pay, basically, 
to drug cartels to bring you into the 
United States? And it was usually be-
tween $5,000 and $8,000. 
And then often they would say, You 
don’t have that kind of money. Where 
did you get that money? And they 
would indicate, Here and there; get this 
much here, this much there. Friends in 
the U.S. sent this much. 
So what about the rest of the money? 
The drug cartels, they are going to let 
them work it off when they get where 
they are going. 
How do they get where they are 
going? Well, at that point, it is either 
Health and Human Services or ICE. 
Border Patrol, their job is along the 
border. They don’t, once they transport 
to a facility, that is usually the end of 
their transporting. But ICE, Health 
and Human Services, and now we have 
the military that is also providing 
transportation. But as the Border Pa-
trol officer said, cartels call us here in 
the U.S.—Federal Government. There 
are logistics. They get them across the 
border, and then—they don’t use UPS 
or FedEx or even the U.S. Post Office—

they use the Federal Government and 
taxpayer money to ship these inden-
tured servants of the drug cartels all 
over the country to cities all over the 
country wherever the drug cartel want 
them to be selling drugs, sex traf-
ficking, human trafficking. The U.S. 
Government actually makes that hap-
pen. They facilitate that. 
We have had so many Border Patrol— 
again, before this last visit to the bor-
der when this administration wants to 
hide what they are doing at the bor-
der—they say, Oh, well, if you give us 
enough notice, then we will put some-
body—and this is effectively what— 
they want to put somebody—I am sup-
pose to supervise—over me to watch 
what I am doing, prevent me from 
doing proper oversight down where 
they are supposed to be doing their job, 
prevent that from happening so that 
America does not see how absolutely 
tragic this invasion is. 
b 1300 
Yes, they are gang members, but so 
many people are coming in, and the 
cartels know taxpayers in the U.S., 
who are funding the drug cartels, are 
also going to pay for the education, all 
the needs of those coming in. 
This administration doesn’t care. 
What they are looking at are future 
Democratic voters. But they have to 
act quickly because the longer the peo-
ple are here, the more they realize, 
‘‘You know what? I am for hard work, 
and I am for making my own way. I 
don’t want to see babies killed in the 
womb. I believe in working a full day. 
I do believe in marriage and strong 
family, devotion to family. I believe in 
God,’’ and they start thinking, wait a 
minute, that sounds more like a Re-
publican than a Democrat. They don’t 
believe in abortion, most of the folks, 
and they do have faith in God and de-
votion to families. 
If you read what BLM said they be-
lieved in, destruction of what they call 
Western-style marriage is one of their 
biggest tenets. Why? Because they are 
Marxist. 
To get to Marxism, you have to cre-
ate chaos. As Paul Harvey used to talk 
about, one of the best ways, and a criti-
cally important way, to create enough 
chaos so that you can move toward 
Marxism is to destroy the family, the 
nuclear family. 
Of course, BLM has it wrong. It is not 
Western-style marriage. It is not some-
thing that North America or South 
America or Central America came up 
with, what is typically called the West. 
It didn’t come from this side of the 
planet or this hemisphere, except in 
the Middle East. 
A man named Moses had a revelation 
from God and let people know here is 
what God says: A man shall leave his 
father and mother, a woman shall leave 
her home, and the two will become one. 
That would be marriage, not Western- 
style. I guess Middle Eastern-style. 
It didn’t originate here. It has been 
found throughout history to be the best 
building block of a very strong society. 
That is why surveys continue to find 
that although, of course, there are peo-
ple that excel coming from broken 
homes and other avenues, the best 
chance a child has of succeeding in life 
is coming from a two-parent home and 
a strong nuclear family. 
I have seen firsthand what Marxism 
does. I have heard the director of what 
we would now call daycare in the old 
Soviet Union bragging that these chil-
dren don’t belong to their parents: 
They are just temporary caretakers. 
We monitor what parents tell their 
children. If they ever say anything neg-
ative about the government, we imme-
diately take the child away and give 
them to a more deserving caretaker. 
I thought, at the time, thank God I 
didn’t grow up in the Soviet Union. 
Thank God I grew up in east Texas, and 
I had a mother and father, and they 
cared deeply about me. I was so grate-
ful for the blessings that I had had. 
Wow, the Soviet Union. It failed be-
cause it was destined to fail. Marxism 
is always going to fail. People think: 
Oh, but it sounds so wonderful, share 
and share alike. 
Now, you have a very small ruling 
class, and then you have everybody 
else. 
I have been in those stores. Toilet 
paper so often, no, it was not available. 
But I learned, and I saw. Real luxuries, 
like real toilet paper, the store would 
get those in and put those in the back. 
If you were a government official, then 
when you came in, they would get you 
some toilet paper. 
If it is a shoe store, when they got 
good shoes in, they kept those in the 
back for government officials. Why? 
Because they were sucking up to the 
government officials. 
In Russia, it was called blat, political 
pull. You wanted to have some, so you 
kept the best of whatever you got in to 
sell for people that had power. You 
would do favors for them so that you 
might have a little power. 
As one Soviet told me, a college stu-
dent: In your country, you can get 
ahead. No matter who you are, you can 
get ahead by hard work, making more 
money, and then money will help you 
make your way up in society. Here, 
there are only two ways to move up in 
society. One is to suck up to people 
who have political power, and I guess 
maybe it is a subheading of that, but it 
is also by ratting out other people. 
As he told me: You can get ahead by 
working hard and making more money 
here. The best way to move up is to 
step on other people. If you see them 
do something inappropriate, then you 
rat them out and that will allow you to 
move up. 
Except for the very top people that 
have everything they want, the other 
people mostly get the same amount of 
income. That was also tried in Ven-
ezuela; it failed. It will always fail. 
Anybody that was so stupid that they 
could not foresee what was emerging, 
and that is a very strong, powerful 
middle class in the United States and 
part of Europe, Marx couldn’t see that 
coming. He was too blind. He couldn’t 
foresee the formation of labor unions 
that could stand up to greedy Demo-
crats, billionaires, such as we have 
here, the billionaires that, by the way, 
paid hundreds of millions of dollars to 
affect the election, who was able to 
vote, and how ballots were gathered. 
Well, over in the Soviet Union, you 
don’t have to worry about that. As Sta-
lin pointed out, he didn’t care who 
voted. He just cared about who counted 
the votes. 
We will be seeing evidence continue 
to emerge from Arizona and Georgia, 
and, I think, eventually Pennsylvania. 
But to hear anybody say that there was 
absolutely no evidence of fraud, it is 
like John Fund said when he wrote the 
book about fraud in elections some 
years back: The biggest fraud about 
elections is the statement there is no 
fraud in elections. There has always 
been. 
Lyndon 
Johnson 
certainly 
knew 
about that, as did people who tried to 
research allegations of voting impro-
priety, and the courthouse burned 
down, 
destroying 
evidence. 
These 
things have gone on. 
Cook County, Chicago, you think 
there has not been fraud in Chicago? 
You would have to be either crazy or 
dishonest to say there has never been 
fraud in elections in Chicago. 
It goes on. The trick is to try to min-
imize the fraud so you don’t disenfran-
chise so many people. 
But there is evidence of fraud. There 
are hundreds, maybe thousands of affi-
davits, sworn testimony, about fraud in 
the last election. 
I know there is plenty in the media 
to say it didn’t happen. Because they 
are saying that, out of either ignorance 
or dishonesty, others feel comfortable, 
including people right here on the 
floor, saying that it is totally de-
bunked, that there was no fraud in the 
last election. That is a statement out 
of ignorance or out of being deceptive. 
But we have to clean up the elec-
tions. We have to quit being a joke in 
the eyes of foreigners who have paper 
ballots. 
Even as bad as things have gotten in 
Iraq, there for a while, they had free 
and fair elections. In 2005, having been 
over there right after the first election, 
talking to one of the chiefs of police 
there, he was telling about how—of 
course, the voters, when they voted, to 
avoid fraud, you dipped your finger 
into purple ink that would last for a 
couple of weeks so you couldn’t vote a 
second time. If you didn’t dip your fin-
ger in there and have proof of who you 
were, you didn’t vote the first time. 
He was telling me that a policeman 
who was monitoring the election saw 
someone suspicious. Upon checking, he 
saw that he had a bomb, a suicide vest. 
He threw the man down, jumped on top 
of him. Both of them were killed. I 
said, wow, I guess that sent all the vot-
ers scurrying, fleeing. He looked sur-
prised and said, no, that they knew if

they got out of line, the policeman 
would have died for nothing. 
The policeman died trying to secure 
the fair opportunity to vote. Yet, now-
adays, that is being belittled: We 
shouldn’t even utilize voter IDs. You 
shouldn’t have to have an ID. 
Well, that is the best way to ensure 
that there is not fraud in the election, 
just like it is the best way to ensure 
that someone is not illegally getting a 
gun or getting a cigarette or getting 
alcohol. People produce those all the 
time. Let’s quit disenfranchising so 
many people that are voting lawfully 
by creating the ability to have people 
vote illegally. 
We keep hearing about: Oh, gee, that 
is not true. We need to censor people 
and not allow them to speak or submit 
things online if they are not in con-
formance with what the liberal Demo-
crat high-tech industry or the liberal 
Democrat media say is true or not 
true. 
We listened to 4 years of lies about 
the Russian dossier when it was pro-
duced by a former MI6 agent in Eng-
land, who even admitted: Yes, my 
sources, they could have been working 
for Putin. 
It was a manipulation paid for by the 
Hillary Clinton campaign and the 
Democratic National Committee. The 
FBI was in cahoots and, in fact, even 
lied to the FISA court. 
It really got my attention, having 
been a judge, to see that FISA court 
judges had so little regard for their 
own status, their own courts, that they 
would not take action to hold in con-
tempt people who held the court in 
contempt by lying, by defrauding the 
court, in order to spy on a Presidential 
political campaign. My goodness, there 
has never been a Presidential campaign 
treated as the Trump campaign was. 
b 1315 
It even had a Democrat official on 
tape admitting: We are the ones who 
paid for violence to get started at 
Trump campaign events so that we 
could claim that Trump was stirring up 
violence. 
That was in 2016. 
For heaven’s sake, we needed a Jus-
tice Department that would be just, 
and we don’t have it right now. For 
heaven’s sake, I heard from a con-
stituent 2 days ago who that day was 
shocked to have two FBI agents show 
up at her place of work in east Texas. 
She had not come to Washington on 
January 6. She was at work in east 
Texas. 
The only reason those FBI agents 
could have showed up at her place of 
work was because her nephew texted 
her a picture of someone who was here 
on January 6 in Washington and asked: 
Do you see anybody you recognize? Be-
cause it looked like his aunt. 
She said: Wow, I thought that was 
me. 
Then jokingly she said: Don’t turn 
me in. 
Unless the FBI were monitoring 
these text messages which was either 
by the grant of a warrant from a FISA 
court that, in my opinion, was break-
ing the PATRIOT Act and was break-
ing the law to grant such a warrant, or 
they were committing a crime and spy-
ing on people’s text messages without 
authority. 
This is getting out of control here. Of 
course, we don’t hear any stories about 
the people who were looting and cre-
ating insurrections in cities around 
America last summer. We don’t hear 
about them being arrested or having 
their homes wrongfully broken into by 
police or Federal officials. No. But we 
are hearing about it, and the illegality 
and the brownshirt tactics of the Fed-
eral Government needs to stop. 
Mr. HOYER says he was shocked 8 
months was all somebody got for dis-
rupting an official proceeding. Well, 
that also happened on June 22, 2016 for 
26 hours on this floor, and I am sur-
prised that Mr. HOYER wants to see his 
fellow Democrats going to prison for 
more than 8 months for obstructing an 
official proceeding. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
ABOLISHING THE FILIBUSTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker, and I rise today to recog-
nize the more than 50 Texas Demo-
crats, State representatives, who have 
taken a stand for liberty and justice 
for all and who have traversed thou-
sands of miles in the name of govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and 
for the people. 
I rise to commend and defend those 
who are making great sacrifices to pro-
tect free and fair elections. They have 
left their homes, they have left Texas, 
and they have come all the way to 
Washington, D.C. They have left their 
families. 
Can you imagine having to leave 
your home and your family on short 
notice? 
This is not something that they 
planned. This is not something that 
they had time to think through and to 
give all of the deliberations and consid-
erations that one might give to leaving 
home for some extended period of time, 
and to be quite candid, not to know ex-
actly how long they will be gone from 
home, some unknown extended period 
of time. They have left their homes, 
and they have left their families. They 
have left their children. 
Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, sim-
ply saying to your child that you have 
a duty to perform, an unexpected duty, 
not something that you wanted to do, 
but something that you know that you 
must do in the name of government of 
the people, by the people, and for the 
people and in the name of liberty and 
justice for all? 
Leaving their children and coming to 
Washington, D.C., some of them had to 
leave 
jobs. 
The 
Texas 
legislature 
doesn’t pay a huge sum of money to go 
to serve, some $600 per month. 
So they have left their homes, their 
families, and their jobs to come to 
Washington, D.C., not to have a vaca-
tion and not to have time to simply so-
cialize and enjoy themselves, they have 
come to Washington, D.C., because 
they want to have those of us who have 
the ability to impact free and fair elec-
tions with H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act, to impact the ability to make sure 
that elections are properly protected 
and that the persons who are going to 
vote have equal access to the polls. 
They want us to pass H.R. 4, once we 
file it again, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act, one that would advance 
voting rights, I might add. 
So they have come here to appeal to 
us to protect liberty and justice for all 
when it comes to voting, to protect 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people because it is the 
vote that accords us this opportunity 
to govern in a fashion that Lincoln 
called to our attention in the Gettys-
burg Address. 
They have come to Washington, D.C., 
to the citadel of democracy in the 
United States of America, and they are 
prepared to stay as long as it takes so 
that they may do what many people 
would admire them for doing but not 
everyone would do. 
They are here to break the quorum 
so that the Texas Statehouse cannot 
pass laws that are invidiously discrimi-
nating. Invidious discrimination is a 
term that I like very much because it 
means harmful discrimination. Not all 
discrimination is harmful. But they are 
here to fight against invidious dis-
crimination, and they come here ask-
ing us to take a stand with them. They 
are breaking a quorum. 
Now, there are those who contend 
that what they are doing is what we 
are contending that the Senate should 
not do. Not true. That is not true. They 
are breaking a quorum. They are pre-
venting the Statehouse in Texas from 
going forward, and they are doing it 
with a rule that requires at least two- 
thirds to be present for business to be 
lawfully conducted. Well, here in Wash-
ington, D.C., we have a filibuster rule. 
A filibuster means very simply this: 
one Member can decide that he or she 
would not have legislation go forward. 
Once that decision has been made by 
one Member, Mr. Speaker, you can 
only break that filibuster with some-
thing called cloture, meaning you now 
have to get 60 votes before you can pass 
legislation with 51 votes assuming all 
Senators are present and voting. 
This rule, the filibuster rule, is some-
thing that is not necessary. It is some-
thing that has been employed by seg-
regationists. It is a favorite tool of

those who have discriminated against 
us when it comes to civil rights and 
human dignity in this country. 
As an example, Southern segrega-
tionist Democrats—that is right, I said 
Democrats—unified in opposition to 
civil rights regularly employed the fili-
buster and prevented cloture. They 
successfully employed the filibuster to 
thwart all nearly 200 anti-lynching 
measures. They prevented a vote on 
several substantial civil rights bills. 
Senator Strom Thurmond in 1957 
took on a civil rights bill for 24 hours 
to filibuster. Former Senator Richard 
Russell was a leading filibuster. Sen-
ator Russell was an outspoken oppo-
nent of civil rights legislation. In 1935 
he and his colleagues in the Senate 
stopped an anti-lynching bill with 6 
days of nonstop talking. In 1964, he fili-
bustered for 60 working days in the 
Senate opposing civil rights legisla-
tion. Later, in 1964, Russell and more 
than a dozen other Senators boycotted 
the Democratic National Convention 
simply 
because 
President 
Lyndon 
Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act 
into law. 
So this filibuster rule is a rule that I 
find no favor with. It is a rule that has 
haunted those of us who seek equality 
and justice in this country for every-
one. The filibuster rule is not some-
thing that is necessary, but that is 
what the Senate can employ. So if 
there is an equivalent of the filibuster 
rule in the Senate as it relates to the 
Texas house, then I might not have a 
problem with it. 
But, Mr. Speaker, here is the prob-
lem: in the Senate, to avoid having the 
necessary number to pass legislation, 
constitutionally, you have to have 51 
votes. You have to ‘‘break’’ the ability 
to pass votes with 51. So if the Senate 
in this United States Capitol would do 
what those who have come here from 
Texas would do, then we would have to 
have them bring 51 people away from 
the floor to prevent the number nec-
essary to have a quorum. They would 
have to break a quorum. They don’t 
have to break a quorum now. They but 
only have to indicate they would like 
to filibuster, and, in so doing, we would 
have to in the Senate here in Wash-
ington, D.C., get 60 votes before we can 
vote to pass something with 51 votes. 
I believe that we ought to eliminate 
the filibuster. I think then if the Sen-
ate would want to do what these brave 
Texas Democrats have done, then they 
would have to break the quorum by 
having 51 people stay away from the 
Senate floor. Right now, they don’t 
have to have anyone stay away from 
the Senate floor. It is easy to do what 
they have done. The Texas Democrats 
have done something courageous be-
cause they have come all the way to 
Washington, D.C. More than 50 people 
have aligned themselves so that they 
can provide a means by which we will 
have the opportunity to pass civil 
rights legislation here—H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act; and H.R. 4 once it is 
filed again, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
My hope is that we can pass both of 
these pieces of legislation. My hope is 
that at some point we will eliminate 
the filibuster. There are those who 
would say: If you eliminate the fili-
buster, at some point it will come back 
to haunt you because the laws that you 
pass to eliminate it, others can pass 
laws to reinstate whatever you have 
eliminated. 
I believe, Mr. Speaker, that if you 
pass good laws, it would be very dif-
ficult to turn them over simply on a 
whim. I believe that a good example of 
this is the law that we passed to accord 
healthcare to people who didn’t have it 
in this country, ObamaCare as it is 
called, but more technically speaking, 
it is the Affordable Care Act. The Af-
fordable Care Act has afforded people 
the opportunity to have good insur-
ance. 
Prior to the Affordable Care Act 
there were people who thought they 
had good insurance. They paid their 
premiums timely. They thought they 
had good insurance until they had to 
use it, and it was at this point that 
they found out just how good their in-
surance was or how poorly they had de-
cided to buy policies that were what 
were called junk insurance. They didn’t 
know because they didn’t need it, and 
they were paying something that they 
thought was reasonable for what they 
thought was coverage that did not 
exist. 
When we passed the law that allowed 
for persons to have good insurance, the 
Affordable Care Act, also known as 
ObamaCare, when we passed this law, 
we then put ourselves in a position 
such that it could be challenged, and 
for years it has been challenged. For 
years there have been efforts to over-
turn it. For years persons have said: 
We will repeal and replace. 
They never ever considered what the 
replacement would be going forward 
with the repeal. To this day the Afford-
able Care Act still stands. 
Mr. Speaker, if you pass good legisla-
tion, then you don’t have to concern 
yourself with the ability of others on a 
whim to simply overturn it because 
they don’t like it, because it somehow 
has given people opportunities that 
perhaps they didn’t foresee or believe 
were appropriate. The Affordable Care 
Act is good legislation, and as a result 
many people have had the opportunity 
to have healthcare that they ordinarily 
would not have. 
b 1330 
Mr. Speaker, I believe we should 
eliminate the filibuster as we have it 
here. I believe we should resort to what 
the State of Texas has, which is a re-
quirement that you have X number of 
senators present to make a quorum. It 
is the quorum that the representatives 
from Texas have challenged. In Wash-
ington, D.C., it is a filibuster that one 
person can call to the attention of the 
Senate and use to thwart legislation. 
If we go to a quorum here in Wash-
ington, D.C., then let the Senators 
come up with 51 people who will not 
show up so that they can prevent legis-
lation from going forward. That would 
be the equivalent of what is happening 
in the State of Texas. A quorum is 
being challenged. There is no filibuster 
that is being challenged. It is a 
quorum. 
I congratulate them and salute them 
and commend them for challenging 
this quorum, to prevent laws from 
being passed that will thwart the ef-
forts of people to vote who sometimes 
don’t have the opportunity to vote that 
I might have, that many of us would 
have here. 
I see nothing wrong with having the 
ability to vote 24 hours a day. Appar-
ently, some in the State of Texas do. I 
remember when we had that oppor-
tunity in Texas. In this legislation, as 
being proposed, it would be eliminated. 
I went out to the polls at midnight, 
and I greeted people who were coming 
to vote. I saw people who were leaving 
work; people who found it beneficial to 
have the opportunity to come to the 
polling place at midnight and cast 
their votes because they are hard-
working people, and they sleep during 
hours that others of us are awake. 
I thought it was a wonderful thing to 
see this voting for 24 hours a day. It is 
a wonderful thing to know that people 
can have the opportunity to do this 
and go right home after work. Not ev-
erybody gets off from work at 5 
o’clock. Many people don’t get off from 
work until 11 or 12 o’clock. So this op-
portunity to vote for 24 hours a day 
was something very beneficial to a 
good many of my constituents in the 
State of Texas. 
Unfortunately, it was not something 
that others approved of and said that 
they disapprove of it because it wasn’t 
something that was being done prior to 
COVID. There are people who said it 
was never done at any place in the 
country before. Since when do we de-
cide that we will not do things because 
they have never been done before? If we 
decide that we will only do things that 
have been done before, where will we 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
make 
progress? How can you move forward if 
you decide that you are going to stag-
nate yourself? 
We haven’t always had electronic 
ballots. We can still vote with paper 
ballots if we choose, but we have cho-
sen to move forward. We haven’t al-
ways had Sunday voting, but we now 
vote on Sundays. We haven’t always 
had 24-hour voting, and I contend we 
ought to have the opportunity to do 
this now. 
Mr. Speaker, I contend to my dear 
friends that it is our duty and responsi-
bility to make it easier for people to 
vote. This is what the State of Texas 
says that it is doing, it is making it 
easier for people to vote. How are you 
making it easier if you are going to 
limit the times that people can vote? 
How are you making it easier if you 
make it harder for people to vote by 
mail? How are you making it easier if

you don’t have the boxes so that people 
can simply drop—safe and secure, by 
the way—safely and securely drop their 
ballots off in various places around the 
county? You are not making it easier. 
You are making it more difficult under 
the guise of making it easier. 
So I contend that these Democrats 
who have traversed this great distance, 
who have come to Washington, D.C. as 
a means of showing the world that 
there are still people who will take a 
stand for liberty and justice for all, for 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people, and protect the 
right to vote. They are defenders of the 
democracy when they do this, because 
the very seat of democracy, the very 
thing that democracy resides upon is 
the notion of having a free and fair 
election. You can’t have a free and fair 
election if you don’t have equal access 
to the polls. 
You can’t have a free and fair elec-
tion if you don’t have the opportunity 
to register and vote without certain 
impediments to your registering to 
vote. That would create a poll tax. Let 
me explain. 
I went to the polls in Texas to test 
the system that was in place. I tried to 
vote with my congressional ID card, 
the card that I can use to vote on 
issues related to the budget of the 
United States of America; the card 
that I can use to vote on issues related 
to war and peace. I could not vote with 
it. I tested the system. I did have the 
proper credentials, but I wanted to test 
the system. 
The system required me, if I am 
going to acquire the ID in Texas to 
vote, it required me to get my birth 
certificate. If you live in Texas, you 
can get this ID at no cost. But I was 
born in Louisiana. I live there, but I 
was born in Louisiana. Persons who 
were born in Texas, you can get the ID 
at no cost. I applied for my ID in Lou-
isiana. 
There were some complications with 
my birth certificate. To this day, I 
have not received the ID that I applied 
for; and that was years ago. The point 
is this: If we are going to have an ID 
card and contend that it is free to per-
sons who cannot afford the cost of an 
ID card, we have to make sure that it 
is free for persons who are not born in 
Texas who don’t have access to birth 
certificates, who will have to send out 
of State. 
In this country, we don’t conclude 
that you should pay a fee to vote, even 
if that fee is to get a birth certificate. 
I contend that this is a way of having 
a new form of a poll tax. Knowing that 
college students in the State of Texas 
who want to vote in the State of Texas 
to get a proper ID to vote, if it is going 
to be a State ID or an ID that they 
don’t have for Texas purposes, they 
will have to get some form of birth cer-
tificate or proof of birth in the State of 
Texas or in this country. They have to 
present this. 
They know that college students 
can’t present it if they were from Cali-
fornia and they are in Texas and they 
have a California identification that 
does not necessarily require the birth 
certificate, then they don’t accept this. 
There is a list of the things that can be 
accepted, and college student IDs have 
been excluded from the list. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today sa-
luting them for what they have done, 
understanding that they are doing all 
that they can to make a difference, and 
understanding that they are appealing 
to us, the Members of this House, to 
help them, to be a part of their effort 
to get H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 passed here so 
as to prevent those in Texas who would 
thwart the rights of persons to vote 
from being able to do so if we can pass 
some of our legislation. 
One piece of legislation, H.R. 4, is ex-
ceedingly important, because H.R. 4 
will bring back the opportunity for 
people in the State of Texas to chal-
lenge 
changes 
in 
laws 
without 
a 
preclearance by the Justice Depart-
ment or a Federal court that might be 
here in Washington, D.C. 
H.R. 4 would restore the Voting 
Rights Act that was eviscerated when 
section 4 of the Voting Rights Act was 
found unconstitutional. When it was 
eliminated, eviscerated, if you will, it 
emasculated section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act. Section 4 was the coverage 
area, so that section 5 could then re-
quire these other things that would 
help persons who are trying to prevent 
States like Texas from doing things 
that were egregious as it relates to the 
right to vote. 
Section 4 would be restored, and as a 
result, we would again have coverage 
for States like Texas, States like Texas 
in Harris County where I live, that had 
White primaries. The State of Texas 
had these White primaries and a man 
named Lonnie Smith took the State of 
Texas all the way to the Supreme 
Court to challenge White primaries. 
The White primaries were set aside. 
The Supreme Court said: You can’t do 
that. 
Well, in an adjoining county, there 
were White pre-primaries. The State of 
Texas has been a bad actor for a long 
time. These persons who have come 
here, these noble freedom fighters have 
come here to solicit our support and 
our help. And I hope that the United 
States Senate will at some point elimi-
nate the filibuster. But if not, I trust 
that there will be 60 persons who will 
help us get to cloture so that we can 
take up H.R. 1 and H.R. 4, laws that 
will help us restore the right to vote 
for all of Americans without these im-
pediments that are being imposed in 
States across the country. 
To honor them, we have a resolution 
that we are filing. This resolution is 
going to honor them for what they 
have done in coming to Washington, 
D.C. It will honor them for the stand 
that they have taken. This resolution 
will be signed by the members of the 
Texas Democratic delegation and filed 
with the House of Representatives. 
We also are sending a letter to the 
President of the United States, a sec-
ond letter, asking the President to 
please meet with them, not in person, 
but meet with them virtually. Meet 
with them and hear their hue and their 
cry, their appeal for help. I am sure the 
President understands the issue, so it 
is not about convincing the President. 
It is about letting them have the op-
portunity to speak and letting the 
President know that they stand firm 
on the grounds of providing liberty and 
justice for all, government of the peo-
ple, by the people, for the people. 
Finally, I am here this afternoon, be-
cause I believe that we all have to be 
accountable for what we do. I believe 
that we all have to, at some point, an-
swer for the positions that we have or 
have not taken. I am here representing 
not only myself but other Democrats 
who could not be here. They are per-
sons who support what we are doing. 
They are persons who are members of 
the Texas Democratic delegation. 
They have demonstrated that they 
are standing in solidarity with the 
members from Texas who are here rep-
resenting those in Texas who believe 
that there should not be these laws 
passed to thwart the efforts to vote. 
But the members of the Texas Demo-
cratic delegation are standing abso-
lutely, totally, and completely in soli-
darity with the Texas State represent-
atives who are here. And my hope is, 
that as we stand in solidarity with 
them, we will at some point achieve 
our goal. Our goal is simply this: to 
make sure that in Texas we have free 
and fair elections. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE 
HONORABLE JERRY LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from California (Mr. CAL-
VERT) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to 
our esteemed former colleague, Jerry 
Lewis, the longest-serving California 
Republican in the history of the House, 
who on a personal level, was my good 
friend and mentor. 
On July 15, Jerry passed from this 
life into the next. For the last 86 years, 
Jerry lived a full life. He made an ex-
traordinary impact throughout the In-
land Empire community he loved so 
dearly, leaving it in a far better posi-
tion than when his decades of public 
service began. 
When I was first elected to this body 
in November of 1992, Jerry was one of

the first people I turned to for guid-
ance. As I embarked on this new path, 
it just so happened that this exciting 
time in my life coincided with a rare 
low point for Jerry, who just lost his 
leadership position as Conference chair 
following the election. 
Well, Jerry’s loss turned out to be 
my gain as I was able to hire a number 
of Republican Conference staff mem-
bers. From that moment forward, our 
offices shared a very tight bond, both 
personally 
and 
professionally, 
that 
would endure for decades. 
Personally, I couldn’t have asked for 
a better person to learn from. Jerry 
possessed a deep understanding of the 
needs of his district, and he methodi-
cally found opportunities to align Fed-
eral resources that could help address 
them. 
In order to achieve his goals, Jerry 
recognized the importance of working 
across the aisle and being bipartisan, 
the realization that was, no doubt, 
aided by Jerry’s first 16 years in the 
House as a member of the minority 
party. Jerry worked with whoever he 
needed in order to deliver results for 
the people who sent him here. 
He demonstrated that if you don’t 
care how it gets done, or who gets cred-
it for it, you can actually get a lot ac-
complished around here. Jerry’s com-
munity benefited in countless ways be-
cause of his leadership. Thanks to his 
efforts, veterans and other residents 
have received better care at the VA 
Loma Linda Healthcare System and 
the Loma Linda University Medical 
Center. 
b 1345 
Students have greater opportunities, 
thanks to his support for STEM edu-
cation at the Apple Valley Science and 
Technology Center, which was later re-
named the Lewis Center for Edu-
cational Research. The entire region is 
safer, protected from flooding, thanks 
to the construction of Seven Oaks 
Dam. I could go on and on. 
Jerry may no longer be with us, but 
the tremendous size and scope of his 
life will endure and continue to make 
impacts for many years and many gen-
erations. 
In 2005, Jerry became the first Cali-
fornian to serve as chairman of the 
House Appropriations Committee. He 
was incredibly proud to fill this hon-
ored position. 
Jerry understood his time in that 
role was finite. He was determined to 
use that precious time to make a dif-
ference for his country, State, and dis-
trict. 
In May 2007, I was fortunate enough 
to join Jerry as a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
In addition to his affection for the 
district, the body, and the Appropria-
tions Committee, Jerry had a deep ap-
preciation for his staff. His office was 
like a family. Jerry had many longtime 
staff members, a clear sign of mutual 
admiration. 
Jerry’s greatest love, of course, was 
reserved for who he always affection-
ately referred to as ‘‘his bride,’’ Arlene. 
Along with their dog, Bruin, the couple 
was inseparable. 
I will always treasure the time I 
spent together with Jerry and Arlene, 
especially Wednesday nights at the 
Capitol Hill Club for prime rib night 
and our regular get-together for Mexi-
can food at La Lomita here on Capitol 
Hill. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to 
Arlene, the Lewis family, and all the 
former Lewis office staff members. 
Like all of you, I simply cannot imag-
ine our lives without Jerry and the in-
credible influence he had upon me. 
I know he is looking down at all of us 
with that smile and chuckle, saying: 
‘‘Enough now, get back to work, 
Kenny.’’ 
Godspeed, Jerry. We will take it from 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. CALVERT for calling this Special 
Order in honor of our former colleague, 
Jerry Lewis. 
As fellow Californians, we were his 
friends and know what a loss it is to us 
that he is now looking down on us. 
Maybe that is what is needed. That is 
the plus. 
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues 
from California—again, thanking Mr. 
CALVERT—to honor a fierce and fearless 
champion of the Golden State, our late 
cherished 
colleague, 
Congressman 
Jerry Lewis. 
Jerry Lewis lived a life dedicated to 
California, from serving on the San 
Bernardino City School Board to his 
decade in the California Assembly to 
his 34 years representing Inland Empire 
communities in the U.S. Congress. 
It was when he was in the assembly 
that I got to know him over 40 years 
ago. I was the chair of the Northern 
California Democratic Party, and he 
was on the committee of jurisdiction 
that was viewing legislation of concern 
to voter participation in our State. 
He always had that smile. He was al-
ways very inviting of ideas, very wel-
coming. I was brand new in the polit-
ical arena, had hardly been involved in 
California politics, and so his warm 
welcome then is something I always re-
member. When we served together in 
Congress, we both remembered it well. 
Jerry and I were friends, again, for a 
long time. 
Then, in Congress, we served on the 
Appropriations Committee, where he 
took great pride in being chair of the 
full committee. How could it be that he 
was the first chair of the committee 
from California? He described it as a 
milestone beyond his wildest dreams. 
Mr. AGUILAR, who is here for bipar-
tisan remembrances of Jerry, is part of 
the Appropriations Committee, and we 
had our own culture and bipartisanship 
there over the years. 
Jerry took great pride in running the 
committee because he knew of its 
power to make a difference in the lives 
of the people he represented. It was al-
ways important to him to reach across 
the aisle because, in his words: ‘‘The 
more we can talk to each other as indi-
viduals and human beings, the better 
off the institution is going to be and 
the more responsive it is going to be.’’ 
When we look around California, we 
see Jerry’s legacy. We see it in the can-
cer research center he established at 
Loma Linda University Medical Cen-
ter; in San Bernardino National Forest, 
which he helped to protect; and the 
Lewis Center for Educational Research, 
exploring the night sky. We see his 
monument in so many tributes that 
bear his name throughout his commu-
nity, from Redlands to Riverside, High-
land to Hesperia. 
It is fitting that Californians were 
able to say good-bye to Jerry at the 
University of Redlands Chapel, in the 
community he so loved. 
Jerry’s unique voice, core values, and 
belief in the promise of America have 
made a difference for California and, 
indeed, for our country. 
May it be a comfort to Jerry’s wife, 
Arlene; their children, Jenifer, Jerry 
Jr., Jeff, and Dan; their grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren; Jerry’s broth-
ers, Ray and John; and all of their 
loved ones, that so many people mourn 
with and pray for them at this sad 
time. 
We will always remember Jerry as a 
great American and a great Califor-
nian. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
ROGERS). 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to 
pay tribute to the memory of that 
longtime friend of ours and colleague 
on 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, 
which he chaired, former Congressman 
Jerry 
Lewis 
from 
California, 
who 
passed away July 15, 2021. 
After working in the insurance indus-
try and serving in the California State 
Assembly, Jerry was first elected to 
Congress 2 years before me, in 1978, and 
served his southern California district 
honorably until his retirement in 2013. 
Serving together on the Appropria-
tions Committee for 30 years, Jerry 
and I became friends due to our respect 
and admiration for this body, the com-
mittee itself, and our singular focus on 
doing all we could to serve our con-
stituents back home in our respective 
districts. 
Jerry was a true believer in our com-
mittee, its wielding the power of the 
purse, and ensuring that we were 
spending taxpayers’ hard-earned tax 
dollars wisely. 
He also prided himself in his ability 
to steer Federal funding to his district, 
including funding for critical, life-
saving flood control projects, impor-
tant cancer research, protecting his 
southern 
California 
district 
from 
wildfires, and much, much more. 
Jerry believed that one of the jobs of 
being a Federal Congressman was to be 
sure 
that 
his 
constituents’ 
voices 
would be heard here on whatever prob-
lem they may be having and that we

should spend Federal tax dollars fairly 
on those projects and matters. 
Jerry and I actually found ourselves 
in direct competition twice, each vying 
for the gavel as chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee. Though he 
won in 2004, I won in 2010. I succeeded 
him as chairman. But we never let 
those races affect our friendship. It was 
never personal. Regardless of the out-
come, we continued to work together 
for the betterment of the country and 
our constituents. 
I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia for hosting this Special Order, a 
fellow member of the Appropriations 
Committee, Mr. CALVERT, especially 
because of the fact that he is the rank-
ing Republican on the Defense Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, a key slot, fulfilling, I think, 
the thoughts from Jerry Lewis himself, 
that this gentleman from California 
has a great future in this body. He is 
living up to it. 
I also want to send my thoughts and 
prayers as well to Jerry’s bride, Arlene, 
and the rest of Chairman Lewis’ family 
as they go through this very difficult 
time. 
There have not been many Members 
of this body that were as motivated 
with good thoughts than Jerry Lewis. 
He was a gentleman. He was a forth-
right spokesman for his district in 
California. He was a patriot who be-
lieved in a strong U.S. defense and 
helped to achieve it. 
We will not see the likes of this man, 
I think, again in this body. He was 
super and superior. I consider his 
friendship as one of the golden jewels 
that I will carry with me for the rest of 
my life. 
Godspeed, Jerry Lewis. Our thoughts 
are with you. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, as Mr. 
CALVERT can attest, Jerry Lewis was a 
larger-than-life figure. 
Over the course of his four decades of 
public service, Jerry was able to rise 
through the ranks here at the House to 
become the chair of the House Appro-
priations Committee. I notice a lot of 
appropriators here with us today, shar-
ing their memories and paying their re-
spects, as well. 
Mr. Lewis earned the respect of Mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle and 
worked tirelessly to promote our na-
tional defense, care for our veterans, 
and ensure folks back home in my com-
munity and his community of San 
Bernardino County received our fair 
share of resources. 
Jerry was quick to remind people 
that he was a kid from San Bernardino. 
Maybe that is why he liked me a little 
more than he should have, because I 
was a kid from San Bernardino as well. 
But that kid went on to serve his com-
munity by advocating for it in Sac-
ramento and eventually here in these 
halls. 
Too often, our region in California is 
an afterthought. Smaller than our 
neighbors to the west in Los Angeles 
and Orange County, the Inland Empire, 
my home, was always Jerry’s home, 
and we have always had to fight for our 
fair share of resources. 
But Jerry dedicated his career to de-
livering resources for our community, 
and his impact can still be felt on the 
ground today and through the years 
ahead. 
He served as my family’s representa-
tive in Congress for many years. Later, 
I had the opportunity to represent him, 
first as his mayor and then as his rep-
resentative in Congress. 
He often called me ‘‘my mayor.’’ He 
would say: ‘‘How is my mayor doing 
today?’’ when he would see me around 
town, usually when he would see me at 
his favorite spot downtown where he 
was grabbing lunch with his bride. 
I have never shared this story with 
Mr. CALVERT. Jerry and Arlene were 
the first individuals to call me after I 
was appointed to a city council va-
cancy a bunch of years ago. The coun-
cil 
appointment 
happened 
in 
the 
evening, and they called early in the 
morning Pacific time. They didn’t 
quite wake me up, but it was a morn-
ing hour on the West Coast. They con-
gratulated me on the appointment, and 
Jerry talked about the importance of 
local government making an impact in 
our daily lives. He reminded me that 
serving was a huge honor but also an 
immense obligation and responsibility. 
While our politics, at times, were dif-
ferent, and he was quick to remind me 
of that, I will always be grateful for 
the advice, for the friendship, for the 
time he and Arlene spent with me over 
the years, meeting in his Rayburn of-
fice, back in town, or at community 
events. He was always measured; he 
was always professional; and he always 
put his community first. 
It is a testament to his legacy that 
his colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle are here today to remember him. 
My thoughts continue to be with Ar-
lene and the family. I appreciate his 
contributions and his friendship. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from California for this Special Order. 
b 1400 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the Democratic leader, the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, if you 
mention Jerry Lewis from California, 
our Jerry Lewis probably wouldn’t be 
the first one you would think of. You 
would think of Dean Martin’s sidekick. 
When I first met Jerry Lewis some 40 
years ago, I guess, now—how long has 
Jerry been gone? Thirty-two years plus 
however long he has been gone—I 
thought of Jerry Lewis. ‘‘Oh, Jerry 
Lewis, yes, he is on the committee.’’ I 
thought of the comedian Jerry Lewis. 
To some degree, Jerry Lewis was a 
comedian. He was a wonderful guy, 
wonderful spirit, a wonderful person. I 
served with him, as I said, for 32 years, 
both in the House of Representatives 
and on the Appropriations Committee. 
Actually, that is not really right. I 
served with him 32 years, but I was 
only on the committee for 23 years be-
fore I became the majority leader in 
2006 and then went off the committee. 
Jerry 
Lewis 
is 
coupled 
in 
my 
thoughts with a guy named Vic Fazio, 
who was also from California, who was 
also on the Appropriations Committee, 
who was one of my closest friends and 
still is. I think about the two of them 
because Jerry Lewis and Vic Fazio, for 
a number of years, headed up the Leg-
islative Branch Appropriations Sub-
committee together. They were a team, 
a positive team, a team that agreed 
that this institution was worth pro-
tecting and worth serving. 
As I think of Jerry Lewis, I lament 
the fact—and in doing so, I want to 
thank KEN CALVERT, also a member, 
for seeing me in the hall and saying, 
‘‘Are you doing this Special Order?’’ 
Mr. Speaker, if he hadn’t talked to me, 
I wouldn’t have known, and I wouldn’t 
have gotten this opportunity to speak. 
Much has been said of what he did, 
but what Jerry Lewis and Vic Fazio 
represented 
were 
Members 
who 
thought about the institution, not 
about party. They were representative 
of a large number of people in this body 
who served when I came here in the 
1980s and the 1990s who shared that 
view. TOM COLE is sitting here. He is 
one of those Members that shares that 
view. 
As I think of Jerry Lewis, I lament 
the fact that we have lost the Jerry 
Lewises—not all of them, but too 
many—who made this body a collegial 
body, not a confrontational body. 
That doesn’t mean we didn’t have se-
vere disagreements. I remember Jerry 
Lewis, at one point in time, said, as 
chairman of the committee, he was 
going to move Goddard Space Flight 
Center, which is in my district, some 
3,000 or 4,000 people, to California. We 
had a little tussle about that. The good 
news 
was 
that 
Barbara 
Mikulski 
chaired the committee in the Senate, 
and the chances of that happening were 
zero. But we had a tussle about that. It 
was a friendly tussle, and I really don’t 
believe he was real. He was just sort of 
getting a little leverage. 
Jerry Lewis was a man of this insti-
tution, the Congress, and of the Con-
stitution. He cared about this country; 
he cared about this institution; and he 
worked positively and constructively 
for both. 
The fact that he was a Republican 
and I was a Democrat was somewhat ir-
relevant. That doesn’t mean it was not 
relevant in terms of our having dif-
ferences. The parties had differences, 
and there were contentious times. At 
that point in time, he was on one side, 
and I was on the other. 
I am, I like to think, a man of the 
House, but I am also a man of the Ap-
propriations Committee. I love the Ap-
propriations Committee. I love the Ap-
propriations Committee because it was 
a committee where compromise, frank-
ly, was easier.

July 22, 2021 
Philosophical differences are tougher 
to compromise on. Money is not so 
tough. We have $100. I am in the major-
ity, so I get $60, and you get $40. That 
is relatively easy. It is much, much 
more complicated than that, but it is a 
committee in which you can decide pri-
orities based upon where you want to 
put your money. I think it is a little 
easier than on issues that are deep, 
philosophically held beliefs. 
I wanted to speak, and I thank KEN 
CALVERT for giving me a heads-up that 
this Special Order was happening, be-
cause we need to get back to the Jerry 
Lewises and Vic Fazios. I lament the 
fact that we are so contentious in this 
body. I lament the fact that there is so 
much tension in this body. 
Everybody in this body has been 
elected by their neighbors and friends 
and people who don’t know them be-
cause that is the only way you can get 
here. I, therefore, believe that everyone 
in this body is due respect, even those 
I vigorously disagree with, because 
they have been sent here by the people. 
But we have lost that sense of cama-
raderie, and we have lost the sense 
that, for the most part, we are going to 
work together. 
I came here when Ronald Reagan was 
elected President. I came here in a spe-
cial election. Even though we had con-
tention, and we had the Boll Weevils, 
et cetera, the overwhelming majority 
of the House, Democrats and Repub-
licans, felt like working together. 
I will close with this. I loved Jerry. 
He was my dear, dear friend. What he 
represented, I think, was so important. 
But we have lost the sense that we are 
all working together for the country, 
for the people. 
I don’t mean we have lost it individ-
ually, but it seems to me that the ca-
maraderie and cooperation that existed 
for a long time that I have served in 
this body is very tenuous at best now. 
Very frankly, I think it was made even 
more tenuous in the last administra-
tion. 
I don’t think we are going to get 
back there. Part of it was because the 
Democrats, when I came here, had been 
in charge for about 20 years, and there 
wasn’t a real sense that everything one 
did would change the complexion or 
the control of the House of Representa-
tives. Now that is the case, so it is a lot 
more contentious. People are thinking, 
‘‘If we do this or do that, maybe we 
will win the majority.’’ That was not 
the case then. 
I want to thank Jerry Lewis. I want 
to thank Arlene. I want to thank their 
family for being the kind of people who 
made those of us on the other side of 
the aisle feel like that was just an aisle 
but we were Americans together, Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives 
together, working on behalf of our 
country and our people and to make 
the House of Representatives the kind 
of institution of which the American 
people could be proud. 
Thank you, Jerry Lewis. God bless 
you. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, as we re-
member the life of Jerry Lewis, I re-
member the first time that I had the 
opportunity to meet with him. It was 
back in 2005. I was a State representa-
tive from Louisiana, and Hurricane 
Katrina had ravaged the whole New Or-
leans region. 
Thousands of people were out of their 
homes. The city was decimated. The 
whole region was decimated, and we 
were starting to work on a plan to re-
build New Orleans. 
Obviously, there was a big Federal 
role to be played. President Bush had 
committed to help us, but it took ac-
tion from Congress to ultimately make 
that happen, to rebuild the levees so 
that the communities could be pro-
tected, to help people get back in their 
homes. And that brought me to Jerry 
Lewis. 
He met with me and a few other peo-
ple, and he committed to do the things 
that needed to be done to help us get 
back on our feet at our lowest point. 
That is who Jerry Lewis was. 
The city of New Orleans, the people 
of the New Orleans region, owe a great 
debt to Jerry Lewis for the things he 
did, the real action he took to help 
build New Orleans back after Katrina. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I think it 
says everything about Jerry Lewis if 
you look at who has come to speak on 
his behalf. We have had the Speaker 
and the majority leader of the House 
from the other party. You have a man 
he squared off against twice for the 
chairmanship of the full committee. 
You have colleagues on both sides. It 
tells you he was a very unusual man 
with very broad appeal. 
I first met Jerry Lewis as a staffer. I 
was the new executive director of the 
NRCC, and I got a call out of the blue 
from one of the most important Repub-
licans in Congress who said, ‘‘Hey, have 
you got time to come over and meet?’’ 
I thought, ‘‘Boy, I am either in trouble 
or something is serious and big.’’ It 
turns out that his deputy chief of staff, 
Letitia White, was married to the 
brother of a good friend of mine. They 
happened to meet at the wedding, and 
he said, ‘‘Hey, there is this kid from 
Oklahoma coming up. You need to get 
to know him.’’ 
Jerry Lewis was the kind of guy who 
reached out to you no matter what. We 
became firm friends from there, long 
before I was in this institution. I used 
to bring people by, particularly clients 
who were running for Congress, to 
meet him because he always helped 
them and always gave them good ad-
vice. 
Then, by happenstance, I had the op-
portunity to come to the Congress of 
the United States. The first person who 
helped me was Jerry Lewis, and the 
first person who gave me good advice 
said, ‘‘Tom, become an appropriator if 
you possibly can.’’ It was Jerry Lewis. 
Then, he helped me get to that spot. 
He was the ranking member, our Re-
publican leader on the committee, and 
guided the decisions I made in terms of 
what positions I would choose, where I 
would go, and what subcommittees I 
would serve on. I always got great ad-
vice, always got tremendous help. 
There was always wisdom in any obser-
vation that he had. 
Like my friends, I am going to miss 
him very, very much. I extend my sym-
pathies to Arlene and the family, but 
this institution lost a great champion. 
We lost a great American. 
God bless him wherever he is now. 
Actually, I know where he is now. God 
bless him. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
bid farewell to Congressman Jerry Lewis, who 
passed away last week at his home in Red-
lands, California. He was 86. 
His impact on his district, his state, and his 
nation are enormous and will not be forgotten. 
Jerry approached the responsibilities of pub-
lic service seriously. 
He was one of the longest-serving and most 
influential Californians in this chamber’s his-
tory—serving a total of 34 years. 
He was the chair of the Republican Con-
ference, a cardinal, and the chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Through it all, he was tireless and effective, 
delivering for the people he represented. 
You can see it in his work: 
Improving health care; 
Building dams and the environment; 
Funding education and scientific research; 
and 
Strengthening our national defense and in-
dustrial base. 
Yes, Jerry was a serious legislator. But as 
everyone who knew him will also tell you, he 
never took himself too seriously. 
He was always smiling. 
He loved his wife, Arlene. 
He was an optimist—in politics, in his per-
sonal life, and about the future of our great 
nation. 
That is his legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, the great Italian writer Petrarch 
said that, ‘‘love is the crowning grace of hu-
manity, the golden link which binds us to duty 
and truth, the redeeming principles that rec-
onciles the heart to life.’’ 
I don’t know if Jerry ever read those words, 
but he certainly lived them. 
He was a statesman and a public servant 
who worked hard for his district, his state, and 
his country because he loved them. 
We should always remember that. 
God Bless Arlene and his entire family. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of our former colleague Jerry 
Lewis. 
My colleagues here have spoken to the 
mark he left on the House of Representatives. 
I’d like to take a moment speak to his legacy 
in the California delegation, where he was the 
longest serving Republican in our state’s his-
tory. 
Whether it was as my counterpart as Chair 
of the California Republican Congressional 
Delegation, during his tenure as Republican

Conference Chair, or his time as Chairman of 
the Appropriations Committee, Jerry was al-
ways willing to work with his California col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to address 
the needs of our state. 
If Jerry had anything to say about it, Cali-
fornia was getting its fair share. 
During his time in Sacramento he helped 
establish the South Coast Air Quality Manage-
ment District. He understood the need to deal 
with the horrific smog that was plaguing much 
of Southern California, and particularly the In-
land Empire. 
George Miller once pointed out that Jerry 
and he were on opposing sides of legislation 
to create the Mojave Desert National Park, but 
that once the park was created, Jerry imme-
diately turned around and worked with the del-
egation to ensure that the public had access 
and that there would be improvements to the 
park. 
That’s the kind of legislator he was—instead 
of being consumed by what divides us, Jerry 
like to move to the next problem to solve. 
We’ve missed his presence in the House 
over the last decade. Our thoughts are with 
his wife Arlene and his children and grand-
children. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life and service of our former colleague, 
Congressman Jerry Lewis. Throughout his ca-
reer, Mr. Lewis was respected for his hard 
work, his in-depth policy knowledge, his com-
mitment to his constituents and to his home 
state, as well as to his colleagues and the in-
stitution of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. Lewis was best known for his commit-
ment to the active work of the Appropriations 
Committee, where he served as Chairman— 
and he was equally well known for his friend-
ship on both sides of the aisle in his role as 
the Dean of the California Delegation. 
He played a leading role as Chairman of the 
VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Sub-
committee—supporting research, development 
and scientific endeavors including the space 
and aerospace sectors that for so long were 
major hubs of economic activity and cutting- 
edge technology in our home state. 
Mr. Lewis was a believer in investment in 
education and in research institutions like the 
University of California system and in re-
sources like the San Bernardino National For-
est, which is located in one of the beautiful 
and distinctive snow-capped mountain ranges 
that backdrop the unique and well-known Los 
Angeles basin landscape. 
A longtime resident of the San Bernardino 
area, including San Bernardino and Redlands, 
cities at the center of his congressional district 
in the diverse and vast Inland Empire, he was 
the product of public schools, graduating from 
San Bernardino High School and later UCLA. 
After college he served briefly on the staff of 
former Congressman Jerry Pettis, as a mem-
ber of his local school board, and later oper-
ated a small business. 
From 1969 to 1978 like many in this body, 
he served in Sacramento as a member of the 
state legislature where he helped establish a 
committee dedicated to addressing air quality, 
a major concern in Inland Southern California 
in the 1970’s. 
In 1978 he was elected to this body, serving 
as Chairman of the House Republican Con-
ference in the late 1980’s, before ascending to 
leadership positions on the Appropriations 
Committee. 
I am honored to have known him as a men-
tor, as a fellow legislator and as a friend. I am 
grateful for his contributions and leadership in 
our delegation, for his unending belief in co-
operation between parties and branches of 
government, and his faith in the leadership 
role of America in the world. 
Mr. Lewis gave much of his life to serving 
our state, working to improve our nation, and 
to serving with distinction his hometown and 
home district—his legacy is an inspiration to 
all of us who have followed in his footsteps 
and proudly serve the state he loved, in the in-
stitution he revered. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Congressman Jerry Lewis, 
the longest-serving House Republican in Cali-
fornia history. 
Throughout his 17 terms in Congress, Con-
gressman Lewis stood as an steadfast exam-
ple of civic service. 
Congressman Lewis knew how to work 
across the aisle and get things done for his 
community, our state and the nation. 
He was known to all as down to earth and 
remarkably kind. When someone addressed 
him as ‘Congressman Lewis,’ he would always 
reply with a smile—‘‘My friends call me Jerry. 
You’re my friend, so please call me Jerry.’’ 
Jerry loved his hometown of San Bernardino 
and was loved back by the community. 
His legacy of hard work, dedication to con-
servative values, humor and kindness will not 
be forgotten. 
I hope you will all join me in keeping his 
family in your prayers during this time.

PAYING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GREEN of Texas). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 4, 2021, 
the Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, so 
we can finish up some things, and for 
many of us who were very fond of Mr. 
Lewis, I am going to yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK), my friend. 
b 1415 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank Congressman CALVERT for or-
ganizing the tribute to Jerry Lewis 
today. 
I knew of Jerry Lewis many years be-
fore I had the honor to know him per-
sonally. He was elected to Congress the 
year that I graduated from college in 
southern California, and he was a well- 
known name then because of his activ-
ism for air quality, which at the time 
was a very serious concern in that re-
gion. 
I then had the opportunity and honor 
to actually be able to work with Jerry 
in Congress. And I have to say I was a 
bit leery about him at first. Jerry was 
a bit of the Republican old guard and I 
had spent an entire career fighting 
that affectation, but what I found was 
a man who was willing to listen as well 
as to be heard, a man who was so inter-
ested in the process and the give and 
take and the sharing of ideas, that he 
really demonstrated what this institu-
tion is all about, how it did work, and 
how it could work in the future if we 
could learn from his example and his 
life. 
I am very honored to join in the trib-
ute to him today on the floor. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. NUNES). 
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arizona for giving 
some extended time to recognize Jerry 
Lewis, who was a statesman, a Con-
gressman from the Inland Empire, a 
good friend to all of us. 
Jerry really was a one-man institu-
tion on Capitol Hill, having served in 
the House for more than 30 years. Jerry 
was extremely effective at serving his 
constituents. He always kept his con-
stituents in the Inland Empire in mind, 
and he was always popular with them. 
Jerry never lost and never received less 
than 61 percent of his vote in any of his 
congressional races. 
Jerry was a veteran Congressman, 
and when I first came to the House in 
2003, I actually already knew him, be-
cause, as was typical of Jerry, he liked 
to work with young people. At the time 
in the eighties and nineties, him and 
Congressman Bill Thomas from Ba-
kersfield, they would organize con-
ferences for young people to teach 
them about policy and politics. And I 
went to many of those events, which I 
have fond memories of, and when I look 
back at that, those were really impor-
tant events in my life that probably in-
spired me in some way to ultimately 
serve with Jerry. I will always be 
thankful for that. 
When I did come to Washington as a 
Representative, Jerry became a close 
friend, a mentor. Jerry taught me the 
ropes and how to assimilate and deal 
with sometimes the strange ways of 
doing things around here. 
Also, back home in California, there 
are many times that I had the oppor-
tunity to visit both Jerry, his wife Ar-
lene, Mr. CALVERT, memorable times at 
dinner doing constituent events, get-
ting to know his area and always focus-
ing as a whole on how we could do 
things better in California and work 
together. 
Jerry ultimately became one of the 
most influential and well-respected 
Members of the House, earning admira-
tion and affection on both sides of the 
political aisle and serving his long ten-
ure with distinction. 
Jerry was a good friend and a true 
statesman who will be missed not only 
in these Halls of Congress but also, as 
well, in California. 
I thank the gentleman from Arizona 
for yielding, and I also thank Mr. CAL-
VERT for organizing this tribute to Mr. 
Lewis. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I yield to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. CAL-
VERT) to give a closing good-bye to Mr. 
Lewis. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me time.

July 22, 2021 
I want to say we are all going to miss 
Jerry. It was a privilege to serve with 
him, and Godspeed, Jerry. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for your patience. You look 
good up there. Maybe this is a har-
binger of the future. 
Before I start—because there are 
some serious things here I want us to 
get our head around on what is hap-
pening financially, and some of the 
things I see that are—and I am going 
to be brutal—a bit dishonest in the 
math on some of the tax proposals—I 
need to share something that has just 
been eating at me for 2 days. 
This place has about a century-long 
tradition during the summer of us 
bringing our children here. John Boeh-
ner actually put it into policy that 
children 12 and under we could bring on 
the floor with us. We tried very hard in 
previous years to make this an institu-
tion that loved and embraced our fami-
lies and our children because to be hon-
est, this is a tough job on the family. 
And so, 2 days ago a handful of us 
showed up here—I brought my 5-year 
old daughter—and we wanted to bring 
our children on the floor. And in-
stantly representatives of the Speak-
er—and I know they are doing their 
jobs, I mean, they were brutal about it, 
but they were doing their jobs. They 
said: You can’t bring your children on 
the floor. 
Why? 
Well, it is against the rules. Okay. I 
will respect the rules. Show it to me in 
writing. And they ran off and came 
back 15 minutes later. Well, we can’t 
find it in writing, but we don’t want 
you to have children on the floor. 
Well, why? 
COVID. 
Okay. If I remember the whole 
science thing, a 5-year-old little girl is 
not a Texas State Democrat, they are 
not super spreaders. Why would you en-
gage in such sort of dystopian cruelty 
to children? The math is the math. 
Do you remember all the speeches 
that my brothers and sisters on the left 
gave us that we need to follow the 
science, particularly in response to 
COVID? Okay. I have been incredibly 
respectful of it. I am someone who has 
never complained on this floor about 
wearing the mask when we wore the 
mask, going through the metal detec-
tors because I figured the public is 
forced to do those sorts of things. But 
come on, if you are going to preach to 
us, we are going to follow the science, 
you know the science on children isn’t 
our problem. 
Why would you engage in such sort of 
cruelty to kids for that one time dur-
ing the summer when we could bring 
our kids here to sit here, and my little 
girl who, as you know, loves you be-
cause you have been incredibly kind to 
her over the years, Mr. GREEN; they get 
marched off with a group of the floor 
staff from the Speaker scaring my lit-
tle girl half to death. You have got to 
get out of here. 
This is sort of the weirdness that this 
place has become under this leadership, 
and the cruelty, this dystopian—and I 
love using that word—the ultimate ex-
planation we got is, well, it is not in 
writing, but we can do anything we 
want. 
When that type of cruelty is off the 
impulse of this leadership, you under-
stand why this place is falling apart 
with hate. And the inability to show 
kindness to children, which aren’t a 
problem, gives you almost a poster of 
what has become wrong with this lead-
ership. 
And I don’t know if it is vanity, I 
don’t know if they have become control 
freaks, I don’t know if it is that these 
were Republican children, so therefore, 
they must be punished, but it was a 
really crappy thing to do to my 5-year- 
old and the other little girls that were 
with that group that just wanted to sit 
with their daddies and their mom on 
the floor. That is what this place has 
become. 
Dear Heaven, I hope when we hit this 
August recess there is some sort of 
soul-searching evaluation of what we 
have turned this place into, because a 
year and a half from now Republicans 
are going to take back the majority 
here, and I hope this hasn’t become so 
embedded in our psyches that it is 
going to become the tit-for-tat seesaw 
where the types of cruelty that have 
been foisted on our families, our kids, 
our Members isn’t handed back, but 
that is where it is going. I needed to 
share that. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to get our heads 
around a couple things that are both-
ering me, also, in regard to the spend-
ing and tax plans and the belief that we 
are not—excuse me, the Democrat lead-
ership—and I understand a lot of this is 
generated from the Senate side, so I am 
not going to blame House Democrats 
because some of the Democrats I work 
with on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee here in the House, we have dif-
ferent views of the world, but they 
treat me very kindly, they are very re-
spectful for the ideas, but some of the 
proposals being put together by the 
leadership are frauds. They are just 
mathematical frauds. 
And the very things that we would 
have been and should have been—and 
Republican hands aren’t completely 
clean on this, but this now has been in-
dustrialized. 
So here is the scam: The left wants 
to spend this much money on the infra-
structure bills they have. The Presi-
dent, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Democrats 
promised we are going to pay for all of 
it. Okay. And then they have industri-
alized gimmicks that are frauds. 
So, first off, we need to deal with the 
reality of what we are about to do, not 
only to my 5-year-old, but to everyone 
that is in retirement or heading to-
wards retirement. Do you understand 
over the next 30 years—and this was be-
fore the spending binge—this govern-
ment is going to be $101 trillion in debt 
in today’s dollars? And most of it is ac-
tually Medicare. 
Now, I have given presentation after 
presentation on how we can change 
that using technology, changing the 
price of delivering healthcare, because 
the ACA, ObamaCare; the Republican 
alternative, Medicare for All, they are 
financing bills; they do not change the 
cost of healthcare. 
And instead, this is the greatest fra-
gility to our retirement security, the 
future of our society because if you 
plan to borrow $101 trillion over the 
next 30 years, you have just sopped up 
actually more borrowable money in the 
world. This mathematically can’t hap-
pen. 
And guess what our debate around 
here is? It is how we are going to spend 
more money. So the left makes—and I 
am going to show a couple examples of 
this—a promise, saying, well, DAVID, 
the American people, we are going to 
pay for everything. 
So let me show you one of the gim-
micks, just to get our heads around 
something that my friends should be 
embarrassed about. 
President Trump offered a rebate 
rule in regard to pharmaceuticals for 
people on Medicare. And the idea was, 
and it is complicated, but the punch 
line is pretty simple: We have a process 
right now where there is a rebate paid 
for through the pharmaceutical compa-
nies to the purchasing managers, and it 
is done to lower the price of the drug at 
the purchasing level. 
The Trump rule was changing the 
path so the rebate would go right to 
the consumer. So instead of lowering 
the price of the drug you would see it 
almost at the register. Okay. Fine. I 
had mixed feelings about it, but Demo-
crats absolutely hated it. It was never 
going to become policy. It was never 
going to become law. This was a pro-
posal from a couple years ago. 
So what does this place do? Well, 
first off, my Democratic brothers and 
sisters spent lots of time attacking the 
idea, making it clear we will never 
allow this to become law. This will 
never become part of the Medicare fi-
nancing system. We are never going to 
do the Trump rebate mechanism where 
the consumer gets it. 
Okay. Then why would they turn 
around and pretend it is a pay-for for 
the infrastructure spending? 
Part of the Democrats’ financing is, 
well, we are going to take 170, $180 bil-
lion over the next 10 years—and by not 
doing the rule that doesn’t actually 
exist that we already oppose that actu-
ally isn’t in practice, but we are going 
to pretend we get $180 billion from 
that—we are going spend it. You won-
der why the American people just real-
ized our numbers are a fraud here? And 
this is proposed with a straight face. 
Our inability to tell the truth. 
I understand if there is an insatiable 
appetite for my friends on the other 
side to do different types of spending, 
and if you are going to make a promise 
to the people in the country that you 
are going pay for it, fine. Okay. Keep 
your promise. 
And this isn’t even an attempt to be 
cute, but this is just blatant. These

dollars don’t exist. They were never 
going to exist, but because the CBO 
will give us a score on it because we 
are going to pretend that this might 
have become policy, even though it was 
never going to become policy, and the 
very people that are promoting it made 
it clear they were never going to allow 
it, hey, we just created another $180 
billion of magic money. 
b 1430 
This is us. This is what this place has 
become. And we need to lead with a 
couple of the other things that are also 
in the tax proposals. 
Okay. I understand my brothers and 
sisters on the left really want to raise 
corporate tax rates, but be honest 
about the math. The best study right 
now says in the first 24 months you 
unemploy 1 million Americans. That 
corporate tax hike unemploys 1 million 
Americans. 
And we still haven’t found a good 
study, and we are trying to actually do 
it ourselves. What you end up saying, 
when you unemploy 1 million Ameri-
cans in the first 24 months, what does 
that actually ultimately cost society? 
What did you just do to Medicare? 
What did you just do to Medicaid, be-
cause they are not paying their FICA 
taxes? What did you just do to unem-
ployment benefits? What did we just do 
to people’s future income power, be-
cause you pulled them out of the work-
force? 
We talk about societal costs to policy 
around here. Oh, no, we don’t talk 
about societal cost to policy around 
here, because we don’t tell the truth 
about the math. So a couple of us—and 
I actually did a fairly detailed presen-
tation about a month ago, saying if my 
friends on the left really need money, 
they want to keep their promise in say-
ing, Hey, we are going to spend all of 
this, we found a trillion bucks—actu-
ally, in one of our calculations of $1.4 
trillion over 10 years. Cut spending. 
Stop subsidizing the rich. It was fas-
cinating. My phone was just dead. My 
email, no one even responded to that. 
See, you have to understand, here is 
how the Democrat financing washing 
machine is working: is on this hand, we 
are going to raise taxes on the rich. We 
want them to pay more. Okay. That is 
the Democrat policy. But on the other 
hand, we are going to turn around and 
subsidize them to about $1.4 trillion 
over 10 years, because we are going to 
subsidize their solar panels; we are 
going to subsidize their new Tesla; we 
are going to subsidize their flood insur-
ance on their house on the beach; we 
are going to subsidize their retirement 
accounts; we are going to subsidize 
their future healthcare. Does that 
make sense? 
It is a washing machine. So I am 
going to raise your taxes over here, but 
then I am going—through the back-
door—because when I subsidize you 
over here, I get power. Because these 
rich people need to get benefits from 
me. I mean, is it that cynical anymore? 
Wouldn’t it be much more economi-
cally efficient, much more rational, 
much fairer to say, I am not going to 
do things that are going to distort the 
economy and economic growth and jobs 
and functioning—my personal fixation 
of how do you lift the working poor— 
but we are going to stop subsidizing 
the ultra-wealthy in the country with 
all these programs. We are just going 
to cut the spending over here. Wouldn’t 
that have been a more rational way to 
find revenues? 
But once again, the dirty little secret 
is much of the rich live in Democrat 
districts on the coasts. Much of the 
dirty little secret is these are the peo-
ple that write the checks. So it be-
comes sort of this washing machine 
fraud of wink-wink, nod-nod. For the 
ultra wealthy we are going to raise 
your tax rates, but you don’t actually 
pay yourself through income, you live 
off your assets. So don’t worry, it is 
not going to affect you. Oh, by the way, 
we are still going to subsidize your 
multimillion-dollar house on the beach 
with subsidized flood insurance. 
That is the type of fraud we are com-
mitting on the American people. We 
are better than this. And I don’t know 
why this place doesn’t own a calcu-
lator, or our brothers and sisters here, 
maybe we are all so busy we don’t ac-
tually read the details of the very pro-
posals. 
So one of the other proposals is 
something that is referred to as the tax 
gap. And the Green Book from Treas-
ury was saying, Well, we are going to 
find $700 billion of under-collected 
taxes. Except when you start to dig 
through it, that number isn’t real. It 
doesn’t hold up to any type of scrutiny. 
So is this another occasion where we 
are going to do a placeholder? We are 
going to put a pretend number in here, 
so we are going to somehow meet cer-
tain CBO scores that we all know is a 
fraud, because if you actually sit and 
read what CBO wrote, they even make 
it clear that, Hey, you can do all these 
things, but within 3 years, those very 
people that you are chasing their taxes 
have changed their process. 
We are also using really outdated 
math. We are using math from before 
tax reform. So a lot of the very me-
chanics of how taxes are collected, 
what they are, are very, very different, 
but we haven’t updated our numbers, 
and we are going to spend $8 billion 
dollars at the IRS. But one of the real-
ly creepy things we are also going to 
do, is we are functionally going to turn 
the banking system into the IRS offi-
cers. 
So almost everything you will do will 
now be part of the IRS system to track 
you. And if you really read through the 
reports, it makes it clear what we are 
going to do is take a lot of the very tax 
revenues, receipts that we are after, 
and we are going to force them into 
ether conduits. I don’t know if you are 
about to create a whole new crypto 
banking system that is going to run 
under the radar, but be careful. 
If it is really about finding the tax 
sheets, a number of us, and actually 
some Democrats on the Ways and 
Means helping, we have been playing 
with a model that would use data, but 
publicly-available data. These data 
services you can buy, you bounce off. 
You see if, Hey, here is what is re-
ported. Does it actually match what we 
are able to find on these public 
records? Instantly, you know if have 
something that needs to be pursued. 
And, yes, it will require a capital infu-
sion to update the data systems. 
But there is this weird fixation in 
government that they want to own and 
control everything, even though the 
very best data that would help us find 
the folks that are cheating actually 
isn’t ever going to sit on the govern-
ment server. It is actually on all these 
lists that are out there. 
There are some great articles talking 
about how the $700 billion number is 
fraudulent. It is just not real. But once 
again, we are going to build our spend-
ing and tax policy on it. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
also apologize. I have had a stunning 
amount of coffee already today. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to mix a 
couple metaphors. I am going to both 
talk about the cost, but I am also 
going to talk about the environmental 
impact. 
A lot of my brothers and sisters on 
the left are fixated on high-speed rail. 
Now, understand, rail is what, a 300- 
plus-year-old technology. So the infra-
structure of the past is functionally 
what we are about to fund. We are not 
funding the infrastructure of the fu-
ture. But you do realize, for one of 
those high-speed rails to work, you 
have got to be running about 10 million 
people on it a year for the environ-
mental impact. 
I am not talking about the huge 
amount of debt, the fact that they 
never will collect anything close in the 
fare boxes. But just to do the environ-
mental impact. Are you going to carry 
10 million people a year? No. 
It turns out it is virtue-signaling 
once again where the math of the envi-
ronmental 
impact 
doesn’t 
actually 
match. But we have a bunch of our con-
stituents, Oh, those choo-choos; I like 
it; fast ones. Oh, look at the Japanese 
ones. But as you also know, the Japa-
nese high-speed rail system is also col-
lapsing financially, too. 
If you really want to have an impact 
in the infrastructure bill, one of the 
most powerful things we can do is we 
can change the cost structures. How 
long it takes to get through NEPA. 
How long it takes to finance. How long 
it takes to get through all the litiga-
tion. 
This is almost unreadable—and we 
will try to put some of this up on our 
website. But we are right now over $500 
million per kilometer just to lay new

rail. We are up here in the very top 
tier. And you look at the countries 
that are ahead of us, they have great 
geographical distances or they are 
going through highly urbanized areas. 
We are not. 
Something is terribly, terribly wrong 
in our cost structure. And so how many 
times have we seen those who are pro-
moting the infrastructure saying, But 
we are going to put a clock; we are 
going to make things more efficient so 
we can actually get this. 
And I will give you one of the great 
living examples: 
In New Mexico, they have this amaz-
ing wind asset. This place that pro-
duces tremendous amounts of wind en-
ergy. And California really needs that 
green energy to meet their rules. They 
are now going on 15 years just to get 
the permit to lay the power lines. And 
they are still not done. They are actu-
ally about to go through their NEPA 
again. 
One of the article says they are not 
going to get it by 2025. I talked to one 
of the consultants for it yesterday; he 
is optimistic they might get it by 2023. 
But they started in 2006 to move the 
power from this incredible wind area. If 
someone really says, I want green en-
ergy, but I am terrified of getting 
crosswise with my trial lawyers, who 
are making a fortune suing on this. I 
am terrified to get crosswise with my 
environmentalist, who sue and make 
money stopping the line sighting. I am 
terrified to have to deal with the mili-
tary, my Tribal lands, my State lands, 
my Federal lands—all these others— 
where the power lines have to go. 
Stop pretending you really want 
green energy if you are not willing to 
change the clock on getting a permit 
to move it. It is just irrational what we 
are allowing. 
We actually have a piece of legisla-
tion that will actually just put the 
clock on these things so it would help 
pull substantially more money. Be-
cause you actually knew what the in-
vestment of that power line, for those 
things to move that green energy. But 
until my friends on the left start to 
adopt these NEPA reforms, it is a 
fraud. 
We are going to put all this money 
into new wind or geothermal, or this 
and that, but we are never going to 
allow the line sighting to move the 
power to the urban areas that actually 
need it. 
I have more of these types of samples 
where if the public policy here is my 
brothers and sisters on the left really 
want more revenues from the wealthy, 
my pitch to them is stop subsidizing 
the rich. Because what you are talking 
about doing in raising capital gains, 
raising this—you do realize that tax 
foundation number the other day said 
the capital gains tax hike actually 
loses $33 billion. It loses $33 billion over 
10 years. 
The only thing that actually makes 
money is raising what they call the 
bases. It is how much you are able to 
put into the different tax rates. And 
with inflation right now, have my 
brothers and sisters on the left realize 
what they are about to do to people 
with homes? 
How many of our homes have gone up 
dramatically in value? How much of 
that is actually appreciation? How 
much of it is just inflation? 
How many of our kids or friends will 
ever be able to buy their first home 
anymore because what we have done in 
skyrocketing the prices? But how 
about the person that is going to retire 
or trying to sell the house because that 
is their nest egg, and we are now going 
to tax them on inflation. We are not 
going to tax them on appreciation, be-
cause the other house they have to buy 
is also inflated. 
This is one of the math realities. We 
don’t tell the truth that much of the 
capital gains that my brothers and sis-
ters on the left are so excited about 
getting isn’t actually capital gains 
on—So I made all this money. It is just 
the fact that we have had a bunch of 
inflation and the values went up. 
Mr. Speaker, if you were to sell your 
house today, and run down the street 
and go buy something similar or even 
better, that other one you are buying is 
also just as expensive. You didn’t real-
ly gain anything. But if the gain was 
over, what, $250,000 per person, you are 
going to pay taxes. You are going to 
pay capital gains on it. 
This is absurd the way we are ap-
proaching the financing of this. And I 
will argue, I think we have some pro-
posals that would make the environ-
mental 
impact 
of 
infrastructure 
greener, more sustainable, financeable, 
workable. But so much of the bill right 
now reads as financing cash flow for 
those people that write checks to the 
left. We are better than this. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your pa-
tience with me, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

REVISION TO THE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER 
BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, July 22, 2021. 
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to sections 1 
and 2 of House Resolution 467 (117th Con-
gress) and the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 (CBA), I hereby submit for printing in 
the Congressional Record a revision to the 
allocations set forth in the statement of al-
locations and other budgetary levels for fis-
cal year 2022, published in the Congressional 
Record on June 24, 2021. 
This revision is for allowable adjustments 
for amounts for wildfire suppression, disaster 
relief, and program integrity, to include In-
ternal Revenue Service tax enforcement, 
pursuant to House Resolution 467 (117th Con-

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 22, 2021 
No. 129 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable 
TAMMY BALDWIN, a Senator from the 
State of Wisconsin. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, who inhabits eternity, 
You have given us the gift of this day. 
We will rejoice and be glad in it. 
May our lawmakers never forget that 
they borrow their heartbeats from You. 
Lord, continue to sustain our Senators 
and give them all they need to glorify 
Your Holy Name. May Your Spirit so 
move them that they will live exem-
plary lives. Lord, compel them to be 
just and honest in all their dealings. 
May they remember that our country 
is no better than our citizens and no 
stronger than its commitment to right-
eousness. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant bill clerk read 
the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, July 22, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, para-
graph 3, of the Standing Rules of the 
Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable 
TAMMY BALDWIN, a Senator from the 
State of Wisconsin, to perform the du-
ties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Ms. BALDWIN thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last night, the Senate took a vote on 
whether to proceed to a debate on in-
frastructure. Unfortunately, our Re-
publican colleagues blocked the Senate 
from taking this first entirely proce-
dural step. 
I understand that the effort to finish 
the text of the bipartisan bill has pro-
gressed since I announced this vote last 
week. The negotiators have made sig-
nificant progress, but there are still 
some outstanding issues. Therefore, at 
the end of the vote yesterday, I 
changed my response to a no so that I 
may move to reconsider the vote at a 
future time. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle should be assured, as majority 
leader, I have every intention of pass-
ing both major infrastructure pack-
ages, 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
framework and a budget resolution 
with reconciliation instructions, before 
we leave for the August recess. I laid 
out that precise schedule at the end of 
June, and I intend to stick with it. 
A new report by the chief economist 
at Moody’s, Mark Zandi, hardly a lib-
eral economist, someone who actually 
served as an economic adviser to Sen-
ator McCain, concluded that both 
major infrastructure proposals are es-
sential to maximize our economic po-
tential—not just one, both. And, to-
gether, they would give a massive 
boost to the economy, ease inflation 
pressures, create jobs, increase produc-
tivity, and reduce income inequality. 
These are incredibly worthy goals, 
and the Senate is going to keep work-
ing on both tracks of infrastructure in 
order to achieve them. 
f 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE- 
MANNING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on another matter, today in the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee, President Biden’s nominee to 
lead the Bureau of Land Management, 
Tracy Stone-Manning, will receive a 
vote to advance her nomination to the 
Senate floor. 
While it sometimes flies under the 
radar, the Bureau of Land Management 
is responsible for overseeing nearly 250 
million acres of public lands and 700 
million acres of mineral rights, a vast 
track of the United States of America. 
No Agency is more important to the 
maintenance of public lands for public 
use. BLM, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, that is, will play a huge role in 
the fight against climate change as 
well. 
Over the past 4 years under Donald 
Trump, the Agency abandoned its mis-
sion, shrunk public lands, targeted our 
national monuments, and opened up 
those beautiful landscapes for cor-
porate 
industrial 
development. 
In 
short, the next leader of the Bureau of 
Land Management has a tall order in 
restoring 
and 
protecting 
America’s 
public lands. 
Ms. Stone-Manning is exceedingly 
qualified to take on this important job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5028 
July 22, 2021 
After serving on Senator TESTER’s and 
Governor Bullock’s staff, she went on 
to lead the environmental agency in 
Montana, where she was respected not 
only by conservationists but by ranch-
ers and fossil fuel interests as well. She 
developed a reputation as an honest 
broker, someone who is firm in their 
principles but always willing to try and 
build consensus. 
Yet the members of the Republican 
minority on the committee are trying 
to turn this consensus-driven, well-re-
spected nominee into another partisan 
flashpoint, dredging up a letter she for-
warded while in graduate school and 
claiming it was evidence that she is 
‘‘an echo-terrorist.’’ The claim is just 
as hysterical as it sounds. 
Ms. Stone-Manning has the full sup-
port of the chair of the committee, the 
Senator 
from 
West 
Virginia; 
Mr. 
TESTER, the Senator from Montana; 
and from me. 
We need someone like Ms. Stone- 
Manning to manage our public lands, a 
staunch advocate for conservation but 
also an honest broker, someone who 
will repair the damage of the last 4 
years and be a faithful steward of 
America’s national treasures, someone 
who understands that conservation pol-
icy has a critical role to play in the 
fight 
against 
climate 
change. 
Ms. 
Stone-Manning has all of those quali-
ties, and I look forward to moving her 
nomination to the Senate floor. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
with COVID–19 cases ticking up all 
across the country, with some bureau-
crats and elected officials actually 
talking 
about 
reimposing 
various 
measures on the American people, the 
Biden administration continues to let 
illegal immigrants pour across our 
southern border, and reportedly, they 
are considering loosening our border 
security even more. 
Remember when the Biden cam-
paign’s rhetoric and then the Biden ad-
ministration’s early actions led to a 
rush on the border. They tried to wave 
it off as a seasonal, springtime surge, 
but, of course, that wasn’t true. The 
numbers just keep climbing. 
Customs and Border Protection had 
more encounters on the southern bor-
der in June than they had in May, 
nearly 190,000 encounters last month 
alone—the highest number in 21 years. 
Law enforcement is coming across 
huge groups of hundreds of individuals. 
With almost 3 months still remaining 
in fiscal year 2021, CPB has already en-
countered 
more 
illegal 
immigrants 
than it did in the entirety—the en-
tirety—of fiscal 2019, which was, of 
course, before COVID. We have exceed-
ed that total with almost 3 months to 
go. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
they are addressing the crisis by sim-
ply speeding up the rate at which they 
get migrants out of custody, out of bor-
der facilities, as if simply reducing the 
head count was the goal. Of course, 
that is no solution at all if the individ-
uals are simply being released into the 
interior of our country. 
Ordinarily, legal immigration is part 
of the heart of the United States of 
America, and it always has been, but it 
simply is not a universal human right 
for everybody in the Western Hemi-
sphere who would like a better job or 
to break our rules and turn up at the 
border. No country, none—no country 
in the world—could govern itself that 
way. 
In fact, this ongoing crisis is su-
premely unfair and uncompassionate to 
the men, women, and children whom it 
continues to entice into the scorching 
desert Sun. Border Patrol agents are 
having to double as humanitarian 
workers and EMTs. They rescue people 
who get lost, who are at risk of drown-
ing, who have been simply abandoned 
by smugglers or traffickers. 
Amidst all this, in the thick of this 
crisis, the Biden administration has 
spent weeks flirting with ending its 
title 42 authority, declaring the COVID 
emergency to be finished and over at 
our southern border and letting even 
more people stream across. COVID is 
already on the rise again, the border is 
already in crisis, and the President and 
his team want to end the emergency 
safeguards at our border? Reimpose 
COVID precautions on the American 
people but end the COVID emergency 
for illegal immigrants? How does that 
make any sense? 
Meanwhile, our Democratic friends 
here on Capitol Hill say they want to 
push a massive amnesty plan into the 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
they want to pass later this year on a 
party-line vote. As if damaging infla-
tion, soaring costs, lower real wages, 
and more debt were not punishment 
enough for the American people, Demo-
crats also want to stuff a massive am-
nesty plan into their tax-and-spend 
spree. It is like they have systemati-
cally identified the worst idea for 
American families on every single 
issue and set about rolling them into 
one huge, reckless proposal. 
f 
RUSSIA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on a completely different matter, 
last year, on a broad and a bipartisan 
basis, Congress passed sanctions that 
were designed to block Russia from 
completing its Nord Stream 2 pipeline 
project. The Biden administration re-
cently waived those sanctions to allow 
the pipeline to move forward. Now it 
appears the administration has cut a 
deal with Germany that will allow the 
pipeline to become operational. 
The initial press reporting about this 
deal does not inspire confidence that 
this administration is taking the Rus-
sian threat as seriously as it should, 
nor does it indicate that we are stand-
ing with our Ukrainian partners, who 
are struggling to defend themselves 
against Moscow’s aggression. The ad-
ministration appears to have ignored 
the broader implications of the Nord 
Stream 2 project and Russia’s approach 
to Europe writ large. 
Green energy initiatives or promises 
of diplomatic meetings will not address 
the real risks Moscow poses—not even 
close. Just a couple of years ago, Wash-
ington 
Democrats 
were 
absolutely 
melting down over their belief that the 
prior administration was being too soft 
on Russia and leaving Ukraine in the 
lurch. Where is the outrage today? 
For several years there, my col-
leagues across the aisle sounded like 
big-time Russia hawks, so I hope they 
will now join Republicans in pressing 
the administration to explain this curi-
ous decision, to explain how President 
Biden intends to impose meaningful 
costs on Moscow for all its misdeeds at 
the same time they have America 
greasing 
the 
skids—greasing 
the 
skids—for this Putin pipeline. 
f 
IRAQ 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on one final matter, next week, 
President Biden is set to meet with 
Prime Minister of Iraq Mustafa al- 
Kadhimi. The meeting comes at an im-
portant moment for our shared efforts 
toward peace and security in Iraq and 
the entire region. 
ISIS has been significantly weakened 
in Iraq and Syria after years of shared 
efforts, but the terrorist organization 
remains a grave threat. And ISIS is far 
from the only threat Iraqis and the 
Iraqi 
Government 
are 
facing. 
For 
years, Iran has systematically sought 
to undermine Iraq’s sovereignty. Iran’s 
well-armed proxy of militias report to 
Tehran, not Baghdad, but they operate 
inside Iraq. 
These groups have conducted cam-
paigns of intimidation and assassina-
tion against peaceful protesters and 
independent journalists in Iraq, the 
same brutal methods they employ in 
Syria, Lebanon, and in Iran itself. 
These Iranian-backed militias are also 
threatening our own American inter-
ests in Iraq. Iran wants to pick fights 
with a superpower while making the 
nation of Iraq bear the risk. 
The fact is, the United States is in 
Iraq at the invitation of their govern-
ment. We are there to support the

Iraqis and to help the Iraqis kill terror-
ists and defend their sovereignty. Our 
presence in Iraq also helps our oper-
ations in Syria against ISIS and al- 
Qaida. 
Again, it is pretty obvious the ter-
rorist threat is not over. Remember, 
the 
disastrous 
withdrawal 
of 
U.S. 
forces from Afghanistan may not sim-
ply be felt in that country; a Taliban 
victory and resurgence of al-Qaida 
could embolden jihadists all over the 
world, just as the rise of ISIS did in the 
wake of President Obama’s withdrawal 
from Iraq. 
As we watch Afghanistan descend 
into chaos and ISIS continue to lash 
out in Iraq and Syria, now is not the 
time for either the United States or 
Iraq to pretend that our shared mission 
is over. As I have warned again and 
again, terrorists don’t observe our po-
litical timetables. They don’t pack up 
just because we lose faith or lose focus. 
So let’s hope this administration is 
already learning from their mistakes 
in Afghanistan. When the Iraqi Prime 
Minister visits next week, the White 
House should provide strong assurances 
that the United States will stand 
strong with our friends and continue to 
support our partners who are standing 
up to terror and to extremism.

pore. Under the previous order, the

each.

f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
America is a nation of immigrants. But 
for the Native Americans, the first peo-
ple over here, all of us have come to 
this country in various stages in our 
family life: personally, through our 
parents, grandparents, and beyond. We 
have built, within the confines of our 
Nation, an amazing story to tell the 
world of how such a diverse group of 
people can come together in one place 
and make a nation that has an impact 
on the world itself. That makes it very 
difficult to understand sometimes why 
we struggle so much with the issue of 
immigration. It is so central to who we 
are, what we have done, what we will 
become. Yet, when the conversation 
comes around about immigration pol-
icy, immigration law, we dissemble 
into warring factions and too often get 
little or nothing done. 
The Presiding Officer may be sur-
prised to know that it has been almost 
36 years—36 years—since this Congress 
has passed any meaningful or sub-
stantive immigration law. The last real 
effort was under President Ronald 
Reagan. That is not an indication that 
our immigration system is perfect. It is 
far from perfect. There are many prob-
lems with it, as we look at it in a crit-
ical and important way. 
I look at it from a perspective that 
maybe is different than some. I am the 
son of an immigrant. My mother was 
brought to this country at the age of 2 
from Lithuania, became a naturalized 
citizen, and was very proud of that fact 
and raised her three boys to be proud of 
it as well. 
Just a few steps from this Chamber is 
my office that I have decorated with 
the naturalization certificate of my 
mother right next to my desk, a re-
minder of who I am, where I came 
from, and also a warning to anyone 
coming into the office that this Sen-
ator feels very strongly about the 
issues of immigration. 
Now I have the responsibility, as 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, to actually deal with the laws 
surrounding immigration. It is not an 
easy assignment. If we have failed for 
36 years to come up with a law, it is be-
cause there are strongly held views on 
both sides. Yesterday was a good illus-
tration of that. 
I called for a hearing with my friend 
and colleague Senator ALEX PADILLA, a 
California Senator, on farm labor, farm 
workers. The reason we wanted to call 
this was because it was not untimely 
that we had received a bill from the 
House of Representatives, which they 
passed on a bipartisan basis, to rewrite 
the laws on farm workers. They did a 
great job. I want to commend them for 
the effort of sending this legislation 
our way, this bipartisan legislation 
with 30 Republicans joining most of the 
House Democrats to enact it in the 
House of Representatives. And now it 
is over on our side of the Rotunda. It is 
a timely and important question. 
We estimate that there are 2.4 mil-
lion farmworkers in the United States 
who plant and pick our crops, milk the 
cows, process the food, and work in 
poultry and meat processing. And with-
out them, these industries would strug-
gle to survive. 
That is not my analysis; it is the 
analysis of the American Farm Bureau 
and many other organizations that rep-
resent agriculture in America. 
Of the 2.4 million farmworkers in the 
United States who pick these crops, 
half of them are undocumented. That 
means that, literally, they work in the 
fields picking the crops that reach our 
tables and they could be deported at 
any minute. 
The bill that came over from the 
House of Representatives addresses 
that. Here is what it says. It says: If 
you can prove that you have worked 
picking crops for at least 10 years—10 
years—and you can pass a criminal 
background check, we will give you the 
opportunity to apply for citizenship. 
But it is not instantaneous. Ten years 
is just the starting point. You then 
have to give us 4 years more of working 
in the fields, and then we will give you 
a green card. And in 5 years more, you 
could be eligible for citizenship. You 
are going to go through all kinds of re-
views and background checks on your 
path to that moment. 
So literally, we are saying to farm 
workers: If you will give us 19 years of 
your life picking our crops, we will give 
you a chance to be a citizen. 
I have just heard that process charac-
terized as amnesty—amnesty. For peo-
ple who are breaking their backs, in 
the sweltering heat of America, with 
the toughest jobs imaginable, spending 
19 years of their life putting food on 
our table and then passing a criminal 
background check, some call amnesty. 
I won’t. 
And if you had listened yesterday to 
the hearing, you would understand why 
even that process, as bipartisan as it 
was in the House, is in a tangle of poli-
tics here on the Senate side. Two 
speeches given by members of the Re-
publican membership of the committee 
really told the story. They started 
talking not about farm workers pick-
ing crops or milking cows or processing 
our food, they started talking about 
terrorists, drug dealers, human traf-
fickers, 
violent 
criminals 
coming 
across our border. 
And they rejected the notion that we 
should give any of them the oppor-
tunity for citizenship at any point. 
They didn’t even read the bill. About 19 
years of hard work in the field before 
you could possibly qualify, they just 
said ‘‘reject it.’’ 
And when I listened to that, I won-
dered what they had for dinner last 
night because it is quite likely that 
whatever they had—whether it was a 
vegan diet or one that included meat or 
other food products—it was on their 
plate because one of these people that 
they have just characterized as a po-
tential terrorist is breaking his back, 
day in and day out, to make sure that 
there is food for every American. 
We heard stories. Linnea Kooistra 
was a dairy farmer in Woodstock, IL. 
She and her husband own a dairy farm. 
That may be one of the hardest assign-
ments in the world. Those cows are 
going to get milked twice a day if you 
are going to make a living, and you 
better be prepared to give time to do it 
every single day, twice a day. She and 
her husband did it for years, won 
awards for their work. 
Now, 
they 
have 
just 
kind 
of 
semiretired into row crops, which are 
challenging, too, but not like a dairy 
farm. And she said: You know, the 
thought of our continuing our farm was 
impossible unless we had immigrant 
labor. 
The jobs on their dairy farm are 
tough, demanding jobs. People aren’t 
lining up to apply for those jobs. They 
needed immigrants to make it work, 
and they couldn’t get them. 
There was a fellow that was there 
yesterday—an extraordinary guy, per-
son; I had just met him for the first 
time—and I ran across him by watch-
ing television. I said, yesterday in a 
hearing, that my appetite for tele-
vision starts with the Chicago Bears 
and goes through baseball, a lot of poli-
tics and news, but I never miss, if I can 
help it, the CBS ‘‘Sunday Morning’’ 
show.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5030 
July 22, 2021 
Two weeks ago, this man named 
Shay Myers, whose home is in Idaho 
and who farms in Oregon growing as-
paragus, came on the show and did 
such a remarkable job, and I said to my 
wife: I would like to get him before our 
committee. 
Well, he was there yesterday, and he 
told his story again, and he told about 
that 
asparagus 
field. There aren’t 
many left in the United States because 
it is tough work and it is unpredict-
able, and some people just can’t make 
it and how tough it was for him when 
finally the entire asparagus crop is 
ready, but there are no pickers for the 
crop. And it is backbreaking, intensive 
work. 
He took his entire production of as-
paragus and basically said: Because I 
can’t clear immigrant workers across 
the border, 90 of them, to pick my acre-
age on asparagus, I am just notifying 
the public in the area, It is free, come 
and take it; it is going to rot in the 
fields if you don’t. 
He just gave up and made nothing as 
a result of it. He grew up, he said, in a 
community in Oregon or Idaho—I am 
not sure which—which was half and 
half, half Anglo, half Hispanic. And he 
said: I am a very conservative person 
politically, but how can you say that 
these people haven’t earned their op-
portunity for citizenship? They work 
so damn hard, and nobody else wants to 
do this work, and we count on them. 
And, he said: I just happen to believe 
that growing these crops in the United 
States is a good thing. American con-
sumers, more and more, are saying: We 
want some standards. We want to know 
about the chemicals you are going to 
use on these crops. We want to know 
about your farming practices. 
He said: I pay close attention to 
those in America. Other countries that 
send us those crops from other coun-
tries don’t pay any attention to it. 
And he made a very, very valid point. 
When I think about those workers and 
how critical they were to him and his 
livelihood, it is hard for me to sit 
here—or stand here and ignore some of 
the criticism of this farm workers bill. 
I want to salute MICHAEL BENNET, of 
Colorado, in particular. He is our col-
league here. And he has, time and 
again, been able to mobilize the grow-
ers and the farm workers into an agree-
ment on a bill. He did it again. He did 
it once before. I saw him do it, almost 
miraculously, with our Gang of 8 ef-
fort, a comprehensive immigration re-
form 7, 8 years ago. And now he has 
done it with this bill. It is amazing. 
Arturo Rodriguez was there, one of 
the founding members of the United 
Farm Workers—an organization, you 
will remember, from the days when 
Cesar Chavez was drawing our atten-
tion for the first time in America to 
who picks the crops. Rodriguez was 
there, and he was speaking for the 
workers again—bringing workers from 
Michigan and Georgia, who were young 
Hispanic women, who were working in 
the field just a few weeks ago and now 
are sitting in the Halls of Congress, 
begging for this legislation. 
When I think about all that and then 
hear that work effort, that bill, being 
dismissed by the Republican leader this 
morning as mass amnesty—‘‘mass am-
nesty,’’ that was the phrase he used—it 
saddens me, and it angers me. It sad-
dens me that many of the Senators 
who are saying these things aren’t lis-
tening to these farm workers who are 
giving their lives so that we can have 
food for our families. 
Tom Vilsack was there yesterday, 
the Secretary of Agriculture. I like 
him. I voted for him twice to be that 
Secretary. I am glad he has the job. He 
told the story of going to the State of 
New York, meeting a man who had 
been a migrant worker, picking crops 
for 20 years. This man had heard about 
Vilsack’s arrival and about this legisla-
tion that was pending, and he said to 
the Secretary of Agriculture: I hope 
this happens so I can see my family. 
And Vilsack said to him: Your fam-
ily, where is your family? 
He said: In Mexico. He said: I have 
been here for 20 years picking crops in 
the United States of America, going 
from field to field and State to State— 
20 years—and I haven’t been able to see 
my family in that time. 
And Vilsack said: Why? 
He said: Because I am undocumented. 
And if I cross that border to see my 
family, I may never get back here 
again to pick the crops and earn the 
money and send it back to my family 
so they can get by. 
We don’t think about that very often, 
do we? We think, Well, these workers 
come in, and everything is just normal. 
Nothing is normal about being undocu-
mented and picking someone’s crops 
and not being able to see your family 
for 20 years. 
I am not going to give up on this 
issue 
of 
immigration. 
America 
shouldn’t give up on immigration. 
There are a million reasons why the 
theory that helping to find good immi-
gration laws is mistaken in some way 
when you consider the fact that each 
year we naturalize a million people in 
America. Those are people who went 
through the process I described many 
times, waiting for years for that oppor-
tunity. And we say a million new 
Americans, through this legal process, 
is normal and good for us. I think it is. 
There are some who say that if we 
said to farm workers, You have a path 
to citizenship, a 19-year path to citi-
zenship, of backbreaking work in the 
fields, that we are sending a message to 
countries to turn them loose, come on 
into the United States, no questions 
asked. I couldn’t disagree more. 
We should have a process in America 
in immigration which we are proud of, 
that reflects our heritage and our be-
lief in immigration as part of our fu-
ture as well. I think there are just 
some basic things that every Member 
of the Senate should consider and, I be-
lieve, should be the basis of our immi-
gration policy. 
First, we need a secure border. In the 
age of COVID–19 and drug dealing, I 
want to know who is coming into this 
country and what they are bringing. 
That is not an unreasonable question 
to ask at our borders. A secure border 
is important for those reasons. 
Second, we should never knowingly 
allow any person to come into this 
country who will do us harm, nor allow 
anyone into this country who threat-
ens us. 
And third, we need an orderly proc-
ess, one that respects the law because 
the United States cannot absorb all of 
the people who want to come here right 
now. We have to have an orderly proc-
ess, knowing who is coming into the 
border and what impact they are going 
to have on our Nation. 
And then we ought to sit down and, 
instead of throwing around all the la-
bels of mass amnesty and terrorism 
and human trafficking, acknowledge 
who these people are. 
One of the things that the Senator 
from Kentucky referred to, I am sure, 
is a decision last week in Texas by a 
Federal court. That judge, Hanen, 
again, ruled in a way that troubles 
me—I think troubles many people— 
that the DACA Program, created by 
President Obama that has given up to 
850,000 young people a chance to be-
come at least legal in America tempo-
rarily, 
was 
unconstitutional 
and 
wrong. I think his decision is terrible, 
and I hope that the Biden administra-
tion appeals it and we win the appeal. 
But the people who are affected by 
that decision, by the DACA decision, 
are young people, as I mentioned—in-
fants and toddlers—brought to this 
country, who grew up here and know 
no other country. They pledge alle-
giance to that flag in a classroom 
every morning. They believe that is 
their flag, this is their country. And 
most of them, when they were teen-
agers, finally realized for the first time 
they have a problem: They are undocu-
mented. 
Should they be given a chance to be-
come citizens of the United States? 
Overwhelmingly, the American peo-
ple—Democrat, Republican, and Inde-
pendents—say: Yes, that is only fair; 
give them a chance. They were brought 
here as kids. Give them a chance, those 
Dreamers, those DACA recipients. And 
to have them characterized as the 
beneficiaries of mass amnesty is un-
fair, and frankly, it doesn’t reflect very 
well on us as a nation. 
If we cannot find in our values, in our 
hearts, an opportunity to give these 
young people a chance to prove them-
selves, it really disappoints me that 
my colleagues would take that posi-
tion. 
These young people are remarkable. 
For 20 years of my public life, I have 
come to know them, and I am always 
amazed by the fact that I don’t have to 
put a footnote at the end of that sen-
tence and say ‘‘except for a few here 
and there.’’ By and large, I have never 
run into one who has run into prob-
lems. I know it happens occasionally,

but it is so rare. These are remarkable 
young people, Dreamers, who just want 
a chance to be part of America’s fu-
ture. 
I have come to the floor over 120 
times with color photographs telling 
their individual stories. Each one is an 
amazing testimony to who we are as 
Americans and why these young people 
want to be part of us and what they 
can bring to this country. Remarkable 
stories—doctors, nurses, teachers, engi-
neers, members of our military, front-
line workers—on COVID–19. They do 
remarkable things. 
One of them, yesterday, appeared in a 
video before our committee, Vicente 
Reyes. Vicente Reyes is a DACA recipi-
ent. His mom and dad are undocu-
mented. He is studying robotic engi-
neering at a university in California. 
Do we need him? I mean, can we do 
without Vicente Reyes? I assume we 
can do without him, but wouldn’t we be 
better if he were part of us, part of the 
American family, and part of the 
American future? 
That is what DACA is about. That is 
what Dreamers are about. If we help 
him, is that mass amnesty to give that 
young man a chance? 
Incidentally, he told a story. He used 
to be out there picking those crops, 
and his mom and dad still are. Every 
morning, he said, before they go to the 
fields for a 10-hour day of back-break-
ing work picking crops, he said: Mom 
and dad hug me. They hug me and I 
hug them back because we know some-
thing. There is a secret in our family. 
My mom and dad are undocumented, he 
said. They may not come home to-
night. 
That is what that family faces to go 
out and do this back-breaking work, 
and that is the reality. And to dismiss 
this as mass amnesty—to even talk 
about a path to citizenship for Vicente, 
to talk about some way to help his 
mom and dad from being frightened 
every single day of being deported, that 
is what I dedicated my work for in this 
Senate and the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee for many years. 
I hope we can find some Republicans 
who will step up and join us in that ef-
fort. We need at least 10 of them. That 
is hard to find. Maybe we can find 
them. I am hoping we can do it soon. 
We have a lot of work to do in this 
country for the Dreamers, for the farm 
workers, for the frontline workers who 
were there when we needed them so 
desperately during the COVID–19 pan-
demic and are still there today doing 
that work. 
We are a big, wonderful nation that 
has a great story to tell, and it is a 
story of success written by immigrants 
with their blood and their toil and 
their dedication to this great Nation. 
We need to renew that effort. 
f 
CAPITOL POLICE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
has been one of the most difficult years 
ever for the Capitol Police here in 
Washington. These are men and women 
who have worked in this building and 
nearby in our office buildings and pro-
tect us to make sure we can come safe-
ly to work every single day and our 
staff and our visitors and tourists who 
come to the Capitol Building. These 
men and women are amazing. 
We know that January 6, 2021, is a 
date that they will never forget. They 
were on the front lines of the violent 
January 6 insurrection that shocked 
this building, our Nation, and the 
world. Hundreds of Capitol Police lit-
erally fought for hours that day to pro-
tect this building and to protect me 
and other Members of the U.S. Senate. 
The attack left one Capitol officer, 
Brian Sicknick, dead and more than 140 
total officers from the Capitol Police 
and DC Police injured. Some members 
said it was the most savage fighting 
they have ever witnessed or been part 
of. Many of them thought they would 
die that day, yet they were back at 
their post the very next day and the 
day after that, and the day after that, 
and this morning too. 
On April 2, the Capitol Police were 
still struggling to heal from the insur-
rection when their department suffered 
another devastating loss. A driver 
rammed his car into a barricade just 
outside the Capitol, a barricade I go 
through every morning. And one officer 
was injured and another officer, Billy 
Evans, was killed—killed. The memo-
rial to him is still out at that barri-
cade. 
Only once before in the 193-year his-
tory of the Capitol Police had the de-
partment lost two members in the line 
of duty in the same year. That was on 
July 24, 1998. This coming Saturday is 
the anniversary of that event, the 23rd 
anniversary of the murders of Capitol 
Police Officers Jacob ‘‘J.J.’’ Chestnut 
and Detective John Gibson. 
It happened on a Friday afternoon. I 
remember the day. Most Members of 
Congress had already gone home for 
the weekend, but the Capitol was still 
filled with staff and tourists. Officer 
Chestnut was at his post guarding an 
entrance on the east front of the build-
ing when a man with a .38-caliber 
Smith & Wesson revolver and a history 
of serious mental illness walked in and 
shot him point-blank in the back of the 
head. The shooter then ran to the near-
est opened door, seeking to escape. 
On the other side of that door, Detec-
tive Gibson just warned congressional 
staffers to hide under their desks, and 
he was face-to-face with that shooter. 
For the first time in his career, Detec-
tive Gibson fired his weapon in the line 
of duty, hitting the man four times. 
The man shot back, hitting Detective 
Gibson twice. Both officers died. 
John Gibson had 18 years with the 
Capitol Police. J.J. Chestnut, a Viet-
nam veteran, had 20 years in the Air 
Force before joining the Capitol Police. 
He 
was 
ready 
for 
retirement. 
He 
thought he was going to be able to take 
time off with his family, but he lost his 
life that day. 
They became the first civilians ever 
to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. 
Today, the Capitol Police headquarters 
is named after them. 
Their murders remained the darkest 
days in the history of the Capitol Po-
lice until January 6, 2021, until a de-
feated and bitter President Donald 
Trump incited an angry mob and sent 
them to this Capitol to try to overturn 
a Presidential election. 
The images from that day are sick-
ening and we have seen them over and 
over. On February 3, Brian Sicknick 
became the third Capitol Police officer 
to lie in honor in the Rotunda. 
I had a chance after that to speak to 
his parents. They were so proud of him 
and they thought he had a safe job as 
a policeman. Working at the U.S. Cap-
itol, that has to be a safe place to 
work. Among the mourners paying 
their respect in the Rotunda that day 
were President Biden and the widow of 
Officer Chestnut. 
Mr. President, the men and women 
who safeguard this Capitol deserve 
more than words from us, more than 
speeches. They protect us with their 
courage and they stand up and fight for 
us whenever they are called on. 
Men and women in law enforcement 
are on the front lines when it comes to 
the Nation’s gun violence epidemic. So 
far this year, at least 36 police officers 
in the city of Chicago have been shot 
or shot at. It is too easy for convicted 
felons and people with serious mental 
illness to get their hands on guns and 
use them. 
More than 90 percent of the American 
people—all political faiths—believe we 
should have serious background checks 
to keep guns out of the hands of people 
who will misuse them: Convicted fel-
ons, mentally unstable people. 
The House passed a bill, H.R. 8, in 
March that would fortify this effort to 
keep guns out of those hands. Senators 
MURPHY and MANCHIN have been lead-
ing the negotiations. They are not 
coming along very well. I wish they 
were. I hope our Republican colleagues 
will join us in supporting that. 
In the meantime, I hope that we 
don’t allow the events of January 6 to 
just become a matter of history. There 
are still important questions we need 
to answer. 
And the Capitol Police have done 
something unusual, maybe the first 
time in memory. They have written us 
a letter and begged us to have a com-
mission to really look into and inves-
tigate what happened on January 6. 
They had so much at stake that day. 
They risked their lives for us. And, 
sadly, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
is 
not 
agreeing to move forward on a bipar-
tisan commission. Speaker PELOSI is 
trying to put one together now and it 
is not easy. I commend her for her ef-
fort. 
It would be a shame for us to walk 
away from the events of January 6 be-
cause of worries about political con-
sequences. We owe it to the American 
people. We owe it to the Capitol Police.

We owe it to the families of those who 
were injured and those who died to do 
our part to get to the bottom of what 
led up to January 6. 
If we want this Capitol to be avail-
able for future generations to visit 
peacefully in a positive way, let’s do 
our part to make sure we get to the 
bottom and answer that fundamental 
question. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Senator from South Da-
kota. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, inflation 
is on the rise. Inflation in June was at 
its highest level in 13 years. Consumers 
are facing the effects: higher prices. 
Americans are facing increases in 
rent, in their restaurant bills, in their 
grocery bills, gas prices, and the list 
goes on. 
Want to buy a used car? 
Expect to pay a lot more money than 
you would a year ago. 
Inflation happens when the amount 
of money out there exceeds the supply 
of products. When that happens, when 
demand outstrips supply, prices in-
crease. And that is what we are seeing 
now. It is being aggravated by Demo-
crats’ decision this spring to flood the 
country with unnecessary money. 
During times of crisis, there is a 
place for increased government spend-
ing. The money the government in-
vested in COVID vaccines, for example; 
the forgivable loans provided to small 
businesses to help them weather the 
pandemic; and the increased assistance 
to hospitals and healthcare providers 
as the crisis escalated. 
But crisis spending is for just that, a 
crisis, or at least it should be. Unfortu-
nately, Democrats have never met a 
temporary 
government 
dollar 
that 
they didn’t want to keep spending. 
‘‘Temporary’’ 
government 
programs 
aren’t really a thing for my friends 
across the aisle. 
And so as the crisis was waning and 
our economy was rebounding, Demo-
crats doubled down on the crisis spend-
ing and passed a massive COVID relief 
bill filled with unnecessary handouts; 
hundreds of billions of dollars for State 
governments, the majority of whom 
were doing just fine without it. In fact, 
many running surpluses. Tens of bil-
lions more for schools who had barely 
made a dent in the billions of dollars 
they had already been given. 
Republicans and at least one liberal 
economist 
warned 
that 
Democrats’ 
massive spending plan could over-
stimulate the economy, but Democrats 
didn’t listen. So it is no surprise that 
the flood of unnecessary government 
dollars is currently helping to boost in-
flation. 
Here is the kicker, Mr. President. 
After flooding the economy with un-
necessary money, Democrats are now 
preparing to double down on that strat-
egy. That is right. Despite passing a 
largely unnecessary $1.9 trillion bill 
just 4 months ago, Democrats now 
want to spend an additional $3.5 tril-
lion—$3.5 trillion. 
The truth is that number is likely to 
be even higher, a lot higher. One esti-
mate suggests that the $3.5 trillion is 
likely to be more like $5 trillion or $5.5 
trillion. That is from an independent 
analysis by the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, where Presi-
dent Biden’s own Treasury Secretary 
used to serve on the board. That is an 
inconceivably large amount of money. 
To put that number in perspective, 
the entire Federal budget for 2019 was 
less than $4.5 trillion—the entire Fed-
eral budget. So Democrats are just cas-
ually tossing out a new spending bill 
that might very well exceed the entire 
Federal budget in 2019. 
I can assure Americans that that 
much money would fuel increased in-
flation. Consumers would continue to 
be squeezed by rising prices and watch 
the value of their salaries decrease. 
But the damage would not be just 
limited to the effects of inflation. 
Americans would also suffer as a result 
of the massive tax hikes Democrats are 
envisioning. Democrats plan to pay for 
all or some of their spending by raising 
taxes left and right on small busi-
nesses, large businesses, investment, 
well-off Americans. All of them and 
more will see tax increases under 
Democrats’ plans. 
The President, of course, likes to re-
peat his mantra that he won’t raise 
taxes on those making under $400,000. 
In fact, that isn’t really true, as the 
President’s plans for a second death 
tax will undoubtedly hit middle-class 
Americans. 
While it is true that the President 
won’t be raising income taxes on Amer-
icans making less than $400,000 a year, 
middle-class Americans will unques-
tionably bear a substantial part of the 
burden of his tax hikes because raising 
taxes, any taxes, has consequences for 
everyone. 
Democrats like to pretend that rais-
ing taxes is a consequence-free enter-
prise, but that isn’t even close to being 
the truth. It doesn’t take an economics 
degree to recognize that. It is common 
sense. Raise taxes enough on anyone or 
any business and that individual’s be-
havior or that business’s behavior is 
going to change. A business facing a 
substantial tax hike may raise prices; 
it may freeze salaries; or it may not 
hire as many new workers, and all of 
those decisions will be felt by ordinary 
Americans. 
Think about it. If a business raises 
prices to deal with the impact of a tax 
hike, who is going to feel it the most? 
Ordinary Americans on a budget. 
What is more, most Americans, if 
they are not self-employed or working 
for government, are employed by busi-
nesses, and if the business they work 
for isn’t doing well, their prospects are 
going to be significantly affected. If 
businesses hold down wages to deal 
with the impact of tax hikes, for exam-
ple, ordinary Americans’ long-term 
earning potential will be diminished. 
These effects may not sound as con-
crete as being handed a tax bill, but 
they have just as real of an impact on 
Americans’ incomes and Americans’ 
lives. 
Studies suggest that 50 to 70 percent 
or more of the burden of corporate tax 
hikes is borne by workers in the form 
of things like lower wages. Combine 
Democrats’ proposed business tax hikes 
with their massive proposed increase in 
the capital gains tax, which would chill 
the investment that helps drive job 
creation, and you have a recipe for per-
manently diminished economic growth 
and a permanent reduction in oppor-
tunity for American workers. 
If Democrats received any mandate 
in the last election, it was a mandate 
for moderation, for compromise, for bi-
partisan cooperation. Yet Democrats 
are behaving as if they had received a 
mandate for a partisan revolution. 
They are busy driving the country 
down the road to socialism with a mas-
sive and permanent expansion in the 
size of government, and their reckless 
tax-and-spending spree will hurt the 
very Americans they claim to want to 
help. 
I hope some of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle will put the 
brakes on their party before the Demo-
crats’ massive spending spree ends in 
economic disaster for the American 
people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
CYBER INCIDENT NOTIFICATION 
ACT 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of the Cyber Incident Notifi-
cation Act of 2021. 
I am very grateful to be joined by my 
colleague and friend, the senior Sen-
ator from Maine, because on this topic 
I am about to describe, she was way 
ahead of the curve, as she is on so 
many issues. She was so far ahead of 
the curve as to what we are talking 
about now, that if the Congress of the 
United States had adopted her pro-
posals back in 2012—back in 2012—we 
might not be dealing with, literally, 
the catastrophic effects of cyber secu-
rity incidents. We didn’t, and that is 
why we are putting forward the Cyber 
Incident Notification Act of 2021. 
It seems like, every day, Americans 
wake up to the news of another 
ransomware attack or cyber intrusion. 
The 
SolarWinds 
breach, 
which 
we 
learned about last December, resulted 
in the compromise of hundreds of Fed-
eral Agencies and private companies. 
The truth was, as we discovered, the 
bad guys actually got into 18,000 com-
panies in the SolarWinds hack. Simi-
larly, the ransomware attack on the 
Colonial Pipeline this past May re-
sulted in gasoline and fuel shortages 
and price spikes across the entire east-
ern seaboard, demonstrating how broad

July 22, 2021 
the ripple effects of these attacks can 
be. 
The truth is these attacks can affect 
hundreds or even thousands of entities 
connected to the initial target. Earlier 
this week, the United States and allied 
governments publicly accused China’s 
government of conducting an extensive 
hacking campaign on Microsoft’s email 
systems, which again compromised 
tens of thousands of computers world-
wide, including those used by some of 
the world’s largest companies, contrac-
tors, and governments. 
These events are finally the wake-up 
call that Senator COLLINS predicted a 
decade ago, a wake-up call for many of 
us in Washington, and even for those 
individuals who sit on these companies’ 
boards that have to understand now 
the threats and capabilities possessed 
by our adversaries. These events also 
reveal major gaps in our Nation’s effort 
to combat and contain cyber threats 
with insufficient communication be-
tween the private and public sectors. 
These 
attacks 
and 
hacks 
dem-
onstrate that our IT and critical infra-
structure—much of it operated, appro-
priately, by the private sector—are 
under constant daily attack. They also 
demonstrate that we need to get better 
insight into cyber incidents as they 
happen—mid-incident—so that the U.S. 
Government can bring to bear its most 
effective capabilities and respond rap-
idly to protect our critical infrastruc-
ture systems. 
We saw that recently when the FBI 
and the Department of Justice were 
able 
to 
claw 
back 
some 
of 
the 
ransomware from the Colonial Pipeline 
attack. With the Colonial Pipeline, 
what happened was we had a respon-
sible private sector company that noti-
fied the government, FireEye, but we 
cannot rely upon the good will of pri-
vate entities to individually, case by 
case, decide whether they tell the gov-
ernment. We need quicker and more 
comprehensive notification. In a sense, 
when an entity is being attacked, if 
that sector is being attacked, we can 
then notify other companies in that 
sector in realtime. 
The truth is we should have done this 
much 
earlier. 
In 
fact, 
SolarWinds 
showed us that, when it comes to wide- 
scale breaches of U.S. networks, no-
body is responsible for collecting infor-
mation on the scope and scale of these 
attacks. This is alarming because this 
information allows us to develop a full 
picture of what was targeted and 
taken, what was at risk, and the type 
of techniques and tactics used by our 
adversaries. 
These are all issues of critical na-
tional security, but as Senator COLLINS 
knows, under current law, there is no 
Federal mandate that companies dis-
close when they have been breached, 
even if they operate critical infrastruc-
ture. Rather, there is the hodgepodge 
of guidelines, depending on the indus-
try, which, as we have seen, at least 
some companies then use as an excuse 
not to report or literally to create a 
whole set of legal gymnastics to avoid 
any level of disclosure. Unfortunately, 
this leaves our Nation vulnerable to 
criminal and state-sponsored hacking 
activity. 
The bottom line is we cannot just 
rely on voluntary reporting to protect 
our critical infrastructure. We need a 
routine reporting requirement so that 
vital sectors of our economy that are 
affected by a cyber breach can have the 
full resources of the Federal Govern-
ment and so that the private sector can 
be mobilized to respond to and fight off 
these attacks. 
That is why I have been very proud 
to work not only with Senator COLLINS 
but also the vice chair of the Intel-
ligence Committee, Senator RUBIO, 
and, in total, 15 of our colleagues, bi-
partisan, mostly all from the Intel 
Committee but also the chairman of 
the Defense Appropriations Committee 
and the chairman—on SASC—of the 
Cyber Committee, to introduce legisla-
tion this week that would require Fed-
eral Agencies, government contractors, 
and the owners and operators of crit-
ical infrastructure to report cyber in-
trusions within 24 hours of their dis-
covery. 
The purpose of this legislation is to 
ensure that the Federal Government is 
aware of and can take immediate ac-
tion to mitigate cyber intrusions that 
have the impact to affect our national 
security. Part of that notification will 
be not just to let the government know 
but to let others in the private sector 
know as well. Consequently, the bipar-
tisan Cybersecurity Incident Notifica-
tion Act of 2021 would require covered 
entities to notify the Department of 
Homeland 
Security’s 
Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency, or 
CISA, when a breach is detected so 
that the U.S. Government can mobilize 
to protect critical industries across our 
country. These covered entities include 
healthcare, transportation, financial 
services, agriculture, energy, and infor-
mation technology sectors. 
Now, the executive branch should 
have the flexibility to respond to shift-
ing threats. The bill leaves some dis-
cretion for this and future administra-
tions to determine whether other enti-
ties or classes of entities should be in-
cluded at a later date. 
To incentivize this information shar-
ing to take place, the bill would grant 
limited immunity and confidentiality 
to companies that come forward to re-
port a breach. It would also include 
data 
protection 
procedures 
to 
anonymize personally identifiable in-
formation and to, again, safeguard pri-
vacy. 
These are not liability protections 
that would shield network operators, 
though, 
from 
negligence 
or 
mis-
conduct. Rather, they would help pre-
vent companies that come forward 
under this legislation from facing 
reputational risk just for reporting 
this vital information to the govern-
ment. 
Ultimately, I see this kind of notifi-
cation as providing value, as I said, to 
the private sector as well so that we 
may have this common defense. There 
is no way we can solve this problem 
with government alone or with the pri-
vate sector alone. There should not 
only be a rapid public notification but, 
in appropriate cases, swift government 
action. 
Ultimately, we need to recognize 
that the threat landscape has fun-
damentally changed from even a few 
years ago. A few years ago, Senator 
COLLINS had this approach, and I think 
the private sector was concerned about 
undue 
mandates. 
The 
world 
has 
changed, and even many of the busi-
ness organizations now agree that, as 
long as we grant that limited immu-
nity and confidentiality, we need to 
put this reporting mechanism in place 
so that the public sector and the pri-
vate sector can respond. 
The truth is there are literally 
terabytes of sensitive data out there, 
including intellectual property, per-
sonal information, contract details, 
and others that could be exploited. For 
that matter, what if the SolarWinds at-
tack had not been one of exploiting and 
taking out information but had actu-
ally been a denial-of-service attack, 
which we saw with Russia taking place 
against Ukraine a number of years 
back? That could have taken place 
with SolarWinds and completely shut 
down our economy, and we have all 
seen recently a dramatic upsurge in 
ransomware. 
The truth is every company and vir-
tually every part of government is 
under daily attack from these cyber 
criminals and, in some cases, from for-
eign intelligence services. The Federal 
Government must have the expertise 
and the willingness to share this infor-
mation in realtime to make sure that 
we can counter this. I think this is a 
sensible first step in finally putting in 
place the kind of broad-based cyber 
strategy our country needs. So I urge 
my colleagues to join the 15 of us and 
pass the Cyber Incident Notification 
Act of 2021. 
Again, I note my friend, the Senator 
from Maine, is here. We have been 
spending a lot of time together, but I 
really appreciate her lead sponsorship 
of this legislation. 
I will say it on the floor of the Sen-
ate, as I have said in so many private 
settings over the last number of weeks 
on some other things, if we had just lis-
tened earlier to the Senator from 
Maine, we would have been in a lot bet-
ter shape today in this country. 
With that, I yield to my colleague, 
the Senator from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, 
let me thank my good friend and the 
leader of the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, Chairman WARNER, for paving 
the way for this legislation. He cares 
deeply about our country’s response to 
these terrible cyber attacks and intru-
sions, and I am so grateful for his lead-
ership and for his working with me to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5034 
July 22, 2021 
produce the Cyber Incident Notifica-
tion Act of 2021. 
As the chairman has mentioned, this 
is a bipartisan bill that is broadly sup-
ported. It would strengthen our re-
sponse to cyber attacks and, thus, help 
to prevent future cyber intrusions. It 
would require government Agencies, 
Federal contractors, and critical infra-
structure entities, which are over-
whelmingly owned and operated by the 
private sector and other important sec-
tors, to notify the U.S. Government if 
they become the victims of a signifi-
cant cyber attack or intrusion. 
This effort is a direct outgrowth of 
our work on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee 
and 
reflects 
our 
long-
standing concern regarding the lack of 
timely notification of cyber attacks 
that can lead to extremely serious con-
sequences for our economy, for our na-
tional security, and for our individual 
privacy. 
In September of 2019, for example, 
Russian hackers gained access to the 
SolarWinds’ software. This resulted in 
a supply chain compromise that was 
downloaded by up to 18,000 of its cus-
tomers. These hackers then conducted 
follow-on operations that compromised 
9 Federal Agencies and 100 private-sec-
tor networks. 
We did not become aware of this hack 
until more than a year later and only 
then because a cybersecurity firm 
called FireEye voluntarily notified the 
Federal Government and the public. 
Just to reiterate that important 
point, FireEye was under no legal obli-
gation whatsoever to tell us that the 
software had been compromised, even 
though it affected nine Federal Agen-
cies. We are grateful that FireEye told 
us about this hack, but the fact that 
companies are not mandated to do so 
leaves our economy and national secu-
rity vulnerable to future attacks and 
lessens our ability to respond effec-
tively when such intrusions do occur. 
Where would we be right now if 
FireEye had not voluntarily disclosed 
the intrusion? Would the Russians’ op-
eration still be ongoing? How much 
sooner would we have become aware of 
these Russian cyber operations if key 
sectors were required to report cyber 
incidents to the U.S. Government? 
As the Senator from Virginia very 
kindly and generously noted, I have 
long been concerned about this prob-
lem and focused on it. 
In 2012, when I was the ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Homeland Security 
Committee, I joined with my chairman 
and dear friend former Senator Joe 
Lieberman of Connecticut in intro-
ducing a bill called the Cybersecurity 
Act of 2012. That bill would have, 
among other things, addressed this gap 
in cyber incident reporting. Unfortu-
nately, our bill did not become law. 
How much more prepared we would be 
today if it had been enacted. 
My 2012 bill would have led to im-
proved information sharing between 
the private sector and the Federal Gov-
ernment that likely would have re-
duced the impact of cyber incidents on 
both the government and the private 
sector. Having a clear view of the dan-
gers the Nation faces from cyber at-
tacks is necessary to enable both the 
public and the private sector to miti-
gate and reduce the threat. We have 
just recently seen the impact of an at-
tack on a major pipeline. Just think 
what the consequences would be of an 
attack that crippled our electric grid. 
What we are proposing in the Cyber 
Incident Notification Act is common 
sense and long overdue. Our bill recog-
nizes the additional burden that this 
reporting requirement places on parts 
of the private sector, and so it, there-
fore, provides additional liability pro-
tection for companies reporting cyber 
incidents and requires the government 
to harmonize these new mandates with 
any existing reporting requirements to 
help avoid duplication. 
The bill also requires the government 
to produce analytic updates for the 
government and industry practitioners 
regularly so that they are aware of 
cyber incidents taking place and tar-
geting their sectors. This should be a 
two-way street of the exchange of in-
formation. 
Let us not delay any longer in pass-
ing a robust cyber incident notification 
requirement. Failure to pass this bill 
will only give our adversaries more op-
portunity to gather intelligence on our 
government, to steal intellectual prop-
erty from our companies, to com-
promise our personal privacy, and, 
most of all, to harm our critical infra-
structure. 
Again, my thanks to the Senator 
from Virginia, the chairman of the In-
telligence Committee, for his hard 
work on this bill. Let’s get the job 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE- 
MANNING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to 
be the Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management. 
This morning, the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee voted on 
her nomination. Every Republican on 
the committee voted no. Before our 
business meeting was over, Senator 
SCHUMER came to this floor, to that 
desk, and he praised this nominee to 
the skies. President Biden and the 
Democrats have wrapped their arms 
around this nomination, and they 
won’t let go. 
So the question is, Who is this nomi-
nee whom the Democrats are embrac-
ing 
and 
every 
Republican 
voted 
against? Well, Tracy Stone-Manning is 
a graduate student who collaborated 
with ecoterrorists. Now, these are peo-
ple who hammered hundreds of metal 
spikes—500 pounds of metal spikes— 
into trees in our national forest in 
Idaho. This is the kind of metal spike 
that they used—10 inches long, very 
thick; 500 pounds of these into the na-
tional forest. 
Tree spiking involves nailing, ham-
mering these rods into a tree. What 
happened? Why did they do that? Well, 
they want to stop progress in terms of 
logging. They want to stop progress in 
terms of firefighting. Because if a 
logger or a firefighter were to hit this 
rod with a chain saw, the chain saw 
would shatter. Devastating injuries 
have occurred as a result. If the saws 
used in timber mills or sawmills were 
to hit one of these as they are planing 
through the tree to produce boards, the 
entire blade shatters. It has been de-
scribed to me by someone who has 
worked in one of these mills—it is like 
a hand grenade going off, damaging 
people all around in the vicinity. Well, 
the results can be fatal, and there are 
examples around the country where 
this has actually happened. Now, even 
the Washington Post has labeled tree 
spiking as ecoterrorism. 
Tracy Stone-Manning, as a member 
of a radical group, edited, typed, and 
then anonymously sent a profanity- 
laced letter threatening the U.S. For-
est Service. Here are just a few quotes 
from the letter. 
She typed: 
You bastards go in there anyway and a lot 
of people could get hurt. 
She typed: 
I would be more than willing to pay you a 
dollar for the sale, but you would have to 
find me first and that could be your WORST 
nightmare. 
This is the letter she typed to the 
U.S. Forest Service. She then mailed 
this threatening letter to the target of 
the tree spiking, and the target was 
the U.S. Forest Service. 
She and her circle were investigated. 
They were investigated for their in-
volvement 
with 
this 
ring 
of 
ecoterrorists and this ecoterrorist at-
tack that actually occurred to the U.S. 
forest. She was subpoenaed. She was 
ordered to give hair sampling, palm 
sampling, handwriting sampling, and 
fingerprint samples to the investiga-
tors. 
She knew full well who the tree spik-
ers were, and she could have easily 
gone to the authorities to identify 
them. She didn’t. She covered it up for 
4 years. She refused to cooperate with 
investigators. 
Recently, within the last couple of 
months, Tracy Stone-Manning came 
before the Senate Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources. She came 
for her confirmation hearing. Since 
that hearing and the statements that 
she made to the committee and affi-
davit she swore under oath and signed,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5035 
July 22, 2021 
since that time, in the last couple of 
months and more recently than that— 
actually last week in one case—several 
people involved in her original case 
have come forward to the press and to 
the 
committee 
to 
set 
the 
record 
straight from the record and the story 
that she told the committee at the 
time. 
So the lead investigator on this case 
wrote a letter to Chairman MANCHIN 
and to me. I am the ranking member 
on the committee. That investigator, 
who I will tell you has worked as a spe-
cial criminal investigator for the U.S. 
Government for 28 years, has been a 
longtime member of the U.S. military, 
served in Vietnam, and retired as a 
criminal investigator because of death 
threats made to him and to his family 
by the group who worked on this 
ecoterrorism—he retired from that. 
But he wrote to the committee. He 
came forward, and he said that she was 
the nastiest of suspects. He said that 
not only did she have knowledge of the 
plan to spike the trees, he said she was 
one of the planners. 
He wrote to us and said: 
It became clear that Ms. Stone-Manning 
was an active member of the original group 
that planned the spiking of the Post Office 
Timber Sale. 
So there he is, a criminal investi-
gator. Then just last week, one of the 
convicted tree spikers, one of the peo-
ple who actually went to jail because of 
that—he came forward in an interview 
in the press. In an interview with E&E 
News, the convicted tree spiker con-
firmed 
that 
Tracy 
Stone-Manning 
knew of the plan to spike the trees, in 
his words, ‘‘well in advance.’’ 
Now, according to the investigator’s 
letter, Ms. Stone-Manning’s lack of co-
operation actually set back their ini-
tial investigation many years. Eventu-
ally, when she was identified and re-
ceived an investigation target letter, 
she had to make a decision. The lead 
investigator said she only agreed to 
testify after she was caught and after 
her lawyer negotiated an immunity 
deal. 
Tracy 
Stone-Manning—she 
helped 
plan the tree spiking. She covered up 
for the terrorists and their activity for 
years. She refused to cooperate with 
authorities, and she only testified 
when she was caught and given immu-
nity. 
After all this, she created a story and 
lied to our committee about the inci-
dent. On a sworn affidavit to her com-
mittee questionnaire, she said it was 
an alleged tree spiking and that she 
was not the subject of an investigation. 
I specifically asked her: Did you have 
personal knowledge of, participate in, 
or in any way directly or indirectly 
support activities associated with the 
spiking of trees in any forest during 
your lifetime? Her response under oath 
was no. 
Both the cop, the criminal investi-
gator, and the criminal, the man who 
went to jail as the group went to jail 
for this—they both came forward after 
her hearing to say that Tracy Stone- 
Manning was lying to the Senate. 
Over the past 30 years, she has made 
contradictory statements about the 
ecoterrorist incident and the network. 
In 2013, she told a Montana State Sen-
ate committee that she was intimi-
dated into sending the letter by a 
stranger. Yet, in courtroom testimony, 
she admitted that the tree spikers were 
her friends. She was one of the ring 
leaders of the group. 
There are many qualified Democrats 
who could run the Bureau of Land 
Management. Within the Federal Gov-
ernment, this is the group who over-
sees one-eighth of all the land in the 
United States. It is astonishing to me 
that Democrats are digging in to de-
fend a proven liar and an ecoterrorist 
collaborator. 
So Senator SCHUMER
came to the 
floor today and made it very clear that 
he is going to support this deeply 
flawed nominee. Will other Democrats 
do it as well? Will other Democrats 
who have millions of acres of BLM land 
in their States—will they join him? 
Things have certainly changed, and 
it is interesting what has happened to 
the Bureau of Land Management and 
the 
nominees, 
because 
President 
Obama’s BLM Director, Bob Abbey, 
came forward. He said that her actions 
should disqualify her from leading this 
important Agency. We are talking 
about President Obama’s Director of 
the Bureau of Land Management says 
her history and her past and her activi-
ties should disqualify her. 
One Biden administration official ad-
mitted to NBC News—this was in the 
last week—her nomination was de-
scribed as ‘‘a massive vetting fail-
ure’’—‘‘a massive vetting failure.’’ 
Now, there is going to be more to say 
about this nominee when an attempt is 
made to discharge her out of the com-
mittee, if they get to that point, a clo-
ture vote on the floor, and again, a 
vote on confirmation. Lots to be said. 
More information will come out. 
It is just hard for me, as the ranking 
member of that committee, to imagine 
a 
nominee 
more 
disqualified 
than 
Tracy Stone-Manning. She has collabo-
rated with ecoterrorists, she has lied to 
the Senate, and she continues to har-
bor truly extremist views that most 
Americans find reprehensible. 
I strongly oppose her nomination. I 
urge all of my colleagues to do the 
same. Tracy Stone-Manning is unfit to 
serve. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING MACNOLIA COX 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, earlier 
this month, Zaila Avant-garde became 
the first Black American to win the 
Scripps National Spelling Bee. It is 
kind of discouraging in the year 2021 
that barrier still needed breaking. 
Her achievement is an inspiration for 
so many students around the country. 
She drew strength and courage from 
another trailblazer who had gotten sig-
nificant less attention, whose story has 
not been told and honored the way that 
Zaila was. 
In 1936, 13-year-old MacNolia Cox 
from Akron, OH, became one of the 
first two Black students to compete in 
the National Spelling Bee. She quali-
fied after winning the regional com-
petition 
that 
went 
60—6–0—rounds, 
sponsored by the Akron Beacon Jour-
nal. Black communities across the 
country cheered her victory. They 
looked forward to her joining the na-
tional competition. She was celebrated 
at churches and clubs, talked about by 
celebrities, and even politicians. At the 
RKO Palace in Cleveland, band leader 
Fats Waller, tap dancer Bill Robinson, 
whom we know, whom history knows 
as Mr. Bojangles, brought her on stage. 
Three thousand Ohioans came to Ak-
ron’s Union Station to send MacNolia 
off on her journey to Washington. She 
had little idea the treatment she would 
endure at the tip of the Jim Crow 
South. She was forced to ride—she is, 
essentially, Ohio’s representative at 
the National Spelling Bee, a 13-year- 
old Black—I was going to say Black 
young woman—Black girl from Ohio. 
She was forced to ride in segregated 
train cars. She was forced to stay at a 
private home instead of at the Willard 
hotel. 
Nine years later, my parents—my 
dad came from overseas, my mom from 
Mansfield, GA—met at the Willard 
hotel at the end of his service in World 
War II. 
She could not stay at the Willard 
hotel because she was African Amer-
ican, while all the other White com-
petitors did. At a dinner for the final-
ists, she and her mother were forced to 
enter through the kitchen door of the 
hotel and sit at a separate table seg-
regated from the other finalists. How 
shameful that was. 
Despite it all, MacNolia Cox made it 
far in the competition. There were only 
five students left when the judges gave 
her a proper noun to spell. She hadn’t 
studied it. Proper nouns were supposed 
to be off limits. The judges had had 
enough of a Black girl getting that far. 
They wouldn’t listen to the Beacon 
Journal reporter, who covered her to 
report on the competition. She pointed 
out to the judges that the judges—the 
judges—weren’t following their own 
rules. She was eliminated. Of course, 
she was. Her achievements, her story 
soon faded from memory until now. 
Zaila Avant-garde talked to the 
media about scrolling through pictures 
of national spelling bee contestants 
with her father, seeing face after face 
that didn’t look like hers. 
It reminds me, yesterday, I had 
breakfast with the Secretary of the 
Treasury at the Treasury Department. 
To get to her office—her office, ‘‘her,’’ 
I reiterate—you walk down a long, 
long, long hallway. Every picture in 
the hallway are people who look like 
me. They were Secretaries of the

Treasury. Every single Secretary of the 
Treasury, until Janet Yellen, looked 
like—well, older, certainly, than the 
Presiding Officer—but looked like we 
do. 
She saw MacNolia Cox’s face, and she 
learned her story as she was looking 
through these. She told reporters when 
she was competing, she thought of 
MacNolia. She thought about what she 
had endured 85 years earlier. 
Now, more Americans are learning 
both of their stories. More kids are see-
ing themselves in the faces of cham-
pions. That is why Black history mat-
ters. It matters in the classroom. It 
matters in movies. It matters on the 
Senate floor. It matters in books. It 
matters in TV shows. It matters in the 
national news. It is how we shine a 
light on the injustices students like 
MacNolia and Zaila had to overcome 
and work to fight them. 
It is how we show kids that these are 
dreams—these aren’t dreams only for 
certain kids who look a certain way. 
These dreams, these aspirations, these 
achievements in 21st century America 
should be for everyone. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Akron’s MacNolia Cox, and 
even more importantly, telling her 
story for future generations. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, over the 
past week, we have put money di-
rectly—directly—in the pockets of the 
families of 60 million American chil-
dren. 
In Ohio, 2.1 million children, their 
families got hundreds of dollars each in 
tax cuts, money to help them keep up 
with the costs of raising a family, 
money they will spend in the local 
economy—I say to the Presiding Offi-
cer, you know this, the largest tax cut 
for working families in American his-
tory ever. 
Stories have poured into our office 
from across Ohio—the Presiding Officer 
is hearing those in Hawaii—all from 
parents who work hard to make ends 
meet. They now have a little bit extra 
of their own money back to spend on 
groceries and childcare and medical 
bills and school supplies. 
We care about families. There is a lot 
of talk in this body about we care 
about families. Well, if you care about 
families, this is all about empowering 
families. Families decide how to spend 
these 
dollars; 
MITCH
MCCONNELL 
doesn’t decide. Joe Biden doesn’t de-
cide. BRIAN SCHATZ doesn’t decide. I 
don’t decide how we spend these dol-
lars. Families decide. They are dollars 
they have earned working hard to pro-
vide for their family—it is hard work 
raising children—and how they have 
raised their kids. 
I think all of us are hearing these 
stories. Some of them on our websites, 
some of us in townhalls, we are hearing 
these stories. Let me just briefly tell 
just a handful of them. 
Rob, from Copley, OH, said he is 
going to spend it on ‘‘bills and neces-
sities, especially necessities for [my] 
kids.’’ 
Traci said she is going to use it to 
‘‘pay for my children’s sports fees.’’ 
One mother said, ‘‘My 8-year-old was 
able to attend a Coding Camp this 
week’’ for the first time. She was just 
thrilled. 
We know how expensive healthcare 
is. We know how medical bills and 
copays and premiums eat away at fam-
ilies’ budgets. So many parents have 
talked about how this will help them 
afford healthcare expenses. 
Leanne, from Akron, is going to be 
able to afford ‘‘my daughter’s medical 
bills.’’ 
Hayley said she will use the tax cut 
‘‘to pay for speech therapy for [her] 
child.’’ 
Susan said it will allow her to ‘‘pay 
for my child’s dyslexia tutoring.’’ 
Jen 
said, 
‘‘Ours 
will 
be 
going 
straight’’—you have to love this one— 
‘‘Ours will be going straight to the or-
thodontist each month.’’ 
Brittney wrote that this tax cut 
‘‘came at a great time.’’ She said: 
My son got sick with pneumonia this . . . 
week. That led to an urgent care visit, 
breathing treatment, chest X-rays, and a lot 
of medicine—so our payment will go to 
[emergency] medical bills to make sure our 
son [can thrive] and has the medicine he 
needs. 
The Presiding Officer may remember 
that there were two votes on the child 
tax credit. First, an amendment to 
take it out—every Republican voted to 
take it out—and then an amendment to 
pass the bill on March 6 at about this 
time of day and every Republican voted 
against it. I know it is all about tax 
cuts for rich people for them, but we 
can get to that later. 
We know another benefit of this is, 
this is money spent in communities. I 
am not getting any notes from parents 
saying: ‘‘You know, thank you, Sen-
ator BROWN, for this child tax credit 
you have been working on for a decade. 
I am going to put more money in my 
Swiss bank account.’’ Nobody is saying 
that. We have gotten so many stories 
already how this money supports the 
economy and supports jobs. 
Katie from Brecksville: Month 1, she 
is using it for ‘‘a much-needed family 
vacation.’’ Month 2, she is using it for 
‘‘school supplies.’’ That supports hotel 
jobs and restaurants jobs and retail 
jobs. 
Lyndsay said she had used it for 
‘‘back to school clothes,’’ again, sup-
porting local retailers. 
Brittany from Butler said: ‘‘We will 
be able to put new windows in the kids’ 
bedrooms that will keep them cooler in 
the summer and warmer in the win-
ter.’’ That sounds like work for a local 
handyman or a woman or a window 
business. 
Lisa said she is spending it on ‘‘dia-
pers and school supplies . . . we put a 
little into starting a 529 college fund.’’ 
Think about that. These families are 
struggling. I don’t know for sure, but 
sounds like Lisa may have a couple of 
children, so she gets this—they are lit-
tle, so she is going to get $300 per child. 
So she gets $600 July 15. She will get 
$600 August 15. She will get $600 Sep-
tember 15. She will get $600 October 15 
and November 15. And she has decided 
she can now afford a few things she 
couldn’t afford. But she is going to 
maybe put $100 of that every month 
into a 529 college fund so her child will 
be—the whole idea of infrastructure is 
building a base, a foundation, to launch 
children 
into 
better 
lifestyles, 
to 
launch children into a more productive 
life, to give kids opportunity. That is 
what this does. That is what the child 
tax credit does. And it is almost every-
body. 
Ninety-two percent of Ohio kids’ 
families are getting a tax cut every 
single month. So many parents men-
tion the costs of childcare. So often, 
over and over, we hear how this will 
allow parents to afford the childcare 
that allows them to go to work. 
Courtney, a mother, wrote that her 
tax cut is already more than half— 
‘‘slightly more than half the cost of 
part-time daycare tuition per month 
here in Athens,’’ down in southeast 
Ohio. She said, it is appreciated so 
much, the ‘‘help getting my child back 
into childcare and keeping me and my 
husband in the workforce.’’ 
So it comes back to one question—I 
think the Presiding Officer knows 
this—whose side are you on? Whose 
side are you on in these fights? Are you 
on the side of the parents who work 
hard every day for their families? 
In a dignity-of-work roundtable in 
our Senate Banking Committee, a 
woman from West Virginia said the 
words ‘‘working’’ and ‘‘poor’’ shouldn’t 
be in the same sentence. The words 
‘‘working’’ and ‘‘poor’’ shouldn’t be in 
the same sentence. These are families 
who are working really hard. Give 
them a little bit of a break so they can 
rise above the poverty line so they can 
afford some things to launch their chil-
dren into more productive lives. 
So are you on the side of these par-
ents who work every day? Or are my 
colleagues going to raise these fami-
lies’ taxes at the end of the year? Be-
cause this expires next year, if we don’t 
continue it. I haven’t seen any help yet 
on their side wanting to come in. I am 
still hopeful. 
We remember what happened on 2017. 
The Presiding Officer remembers this. 
In 2017, you could walk out this door 
pretty much any time of day, and you 
could look down the hall in 2017, and 
you could see lobbyists lined up outside 
of MITCH MCCONNELL’s office, all well 
dressed, all really, really well paid, all 
hat in hand—some literally, some figu-
ratively—saying: Senator MCCONNELL, 
we need this additional tax break. 
Do you know what? We spend $1.5 
trillion on that tax cut. They don’t 
want to spend $100 billion a year on 
these children. One hundred billion is— 
I should do the math really quick— 
about 8 percent of $1.5 trillion, some-
thing like that—6 percent. So they will

do $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Seventy per-
cent of it went to the richest people in 
the country. Yet they don’t want to do 
tax cuts for children that elicit these 
stories. 
I don’t recall, getting on my website, 
stories saying: You know, thank you, 
Senator BROWN—even though I voted 
against it—thank you for that big tax 
cut back in 2017. I could buy another 
yacht, thank you. Or I get to go to Eu-
rope again, thank you. 
We don’t hear those stories. Here are 
the stories you hear about these chil-
dren who need that tax cut. 
So you will remember when they all 
lined up outside of our colleague Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s office. You will re-
member that tax cut. They promised it 
would trickle down to everyone else 
and then it would create all this pros-
perity. Well, we know it didn’t happen. 
They kept the money for themselves— 
no shock there. Corporations turned 
around and spent that money on— 
shocking—stock buybacks for their ex-
ecutives. They ended up, always, in the 
pockets of their executives. 
Now, this year, without a single vote 
from Republicans in Congress, who 
passed tax cuts for everyone else, a 
pretty simple contrast: tax cuts for bil-
lionaires and corporations—thank you 
very much—as they line up down the 
hall, or do you want tax cuts for work-
ing families? 
Every single month, we show parents 
and workers, every single month these 
checks are coming: $300 per child if 
your child is from newborn to 5, $250 a 
month if your child is from 6 to 17. 
Every single month, we show we are on 
your side. We are putting more of your 
own money back into your pockets. 
I know the Presiding Officer joins in 
this. We will not stop fighting to make 
sure parents’ hard work pays off. We 
will not stop. We will deliver on this.

f 
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
many bills get introduced in the Sen-
ate and don’t seem to go anyplace. The 
reason is that they are meant to be 
simply messaging documents, making 
a statement, telling people what you 
believe, not necessarily with the mo-
tive of passing a piece of legislation. 
Now, I usually do not care to com-
ment on these bills. It is simply not 
worth the time. But when I see the 
combination 
of 
false 
information 
spread in messaging bills that could 
negatively impact my State, I must set 
the record straight, and that is why I 
am here. 
Several colleagues just introduced a 
bill to repeal the renewable fuel stand-
ard. I have been a proud advocate for 
renewable energy. Iowa is the leader in 
both wind and renewable fuels. When it 
comes to the renewable fuel standard, 
it is hard to argue that there has ever 
been a more successful clean-fuel pol-
icy implemented across the world. Be-
tween 2008 and 2020, the use of biofuels 
under the renewable fuel standard re-
sulted in a savings of 980 million met-
ric tons of carbon dioxide. That is the 
equivalent of removing over 200 million 
cars from the road for 1 year. The re-
newable fuel standard makes gasoline 
more affordable. It generates good-pay-
ing jobs. It reduces oil imports and re-
duces our country’s greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
The messaging coming from the bill 
rehashes the same talking points about 
ethanol that Big Oil has trotted out for 
the past decades. So, once again, Big 
Oil raises its ugly head. 
Of course, Big Oil’s talking points 
have been completely debunked by the 
latest science and even our nonpartisan 
research from the Congressional Budg-
et Office. And Congress depends a great 
deal upon the research done by the 
Congressional Budget Office, a non-
partisan group of professional people 
that study things a long time before 
they release their information. 
Now, my pro-oil colleagues say that 
the renewable fuel standard causes food 
and feed prices to rise. However, in 
2014, the CBO looked at this issue and 
the impact on food prices if the renew-
able fuel standard was fully repealed. 
The Congressional Budget Office con-
cluded that American food prices would 
be just one-quarter of 1 percent higher 
if the renewable fuel standard was kept 
in place versus a total repeal. Out of a 
$100 grocery bill, the impact is no more 
than a quarter. But when you consider 
that there is a savings of $5 every time 
you fill up your gas tank due to the re-
newable fuel standard, consumers save 
money overall with the renewable fuel 
standard in place. 
My colleagues who introduced this 
messaging legislation also claimed, 
falsely, that corn ethanol achieves lit-
tle to no reduction in greenhouse 
gases. Now, this must be the most ri-
diculous assertion made against eth-
anol. I would like to invite my col-
leagues to visit Iowa to see how far 
ethanol has come in reducing emis-
sions. 
The most recent research from Har-
vard shows that corn ethanol green-
house gas emissions are 46 percent 
lower than gasoline. Research by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture found 
the reduction in CO2 could reach 71 per-
cent by next year if farmers follow best 
practices. 
At a time when the Nation is work-
ing to reduce fossil fuel consumption 
and protect our environment, why 
would my colleagues introduce a bill 
that would increase our dependence 
upon foreign oil and, at the same time, 
increase greenhouse gas emissions? 
And some of these people on this bill 
have the most pure environmental 
record in the U.S. Senate. 
Renewable fuels like ethanol have a 
40-year track record of making fuel 
more affordable and vehicles more effi-
cient. To limit this consumer choice at 
the pump is completely irresponsible. 
Attempts to limit consumer choice, 
which are driven by big oil interests, 
must be defeated. 
The United States should continue to 
build on the progress of the renewable 
fuel standard and bring policy to the 
table that reduces greenhouse gas 
emissions and brings jobs to rural 
America. 
Let me end with a history of the RFS 
because this legislation is a story of 
irony if you consider how we got to the 
renewable fuel standard in the first 
place. You see, Big Oil wanted it. Why 
did they want it? Well, a lot of States 
where they had smog had what we call 
the oxygenate requirement. It was re-
quired in the Clean Air Acts that Con-
gress has passed over the decades. In 
order to meet that standard, Big Oil 
would add what they call MTBE, a 
product made out of petroleum that 
they added to their gasoline to meet 
the oxygenate standards, to reduce 
smog. 
After a long period of time, people re-
alized that the MTBE was poisoning 
groundwater 
in 
California—maybe 
other places as well, but I remember 
mostly the conflict being in Cali-
fornia—and they were being sued. So 
by 2005, Big Oil decided they didn’t 
want to be sued, and what could they 
do to get out of it? Well, the RFS was 
the answer. 
I was chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee at the time. They came to us 
with the ideas of the RFS, and it fit 
into a lot of things that we from agri-
cultural interests were trying to ac-
complish as well. So the renewable fuel 
standard was written in cooperation 
with Big Oil—the first time in three 
decades that Big Oil had any interest 
in working with ethanol industry. 
Then, what, after 3 or 4 years of work-
ing with us, they have been attacking 
the RFS since then. 
This piece of legislation I am speak-
ing about today is just one more exam-
ple of Big Oil trying to attack ethanol. 
And I gave all the facts about ethanol 
being good for the consumer, good for 
the environment, and good for less reli-
ance on foreign countries for our en-
ergy sources. In fact, everything about 
ethanol is good, good, good. 
I yield the floor.

BUCHAR, and COONS to honor the 2020 
Olympic Games that officially start to-
morrow. 
More than 600 of our finest athletes 
have traveled to Tokyo to represent 
the 
United 
States. 
These 
athletes 
trained their entire lives to compete 
this month on the world’s biggest 
stage. They have shed blood, sweat, 
and tears and have sacrificed countless 
hours, many while working separate 
full-time jobs and raising families of 
their own. 
Of course, no one thought the 2020 
Olympics would be starting tomorrow. 
COVID–19 did not just delay the Games 
for a year, it also meant hundreds of 
qualifying events around the world had 
to be canceled and relocated. 
We recognize the dedication of the 
athletes and coaches of the U.S. Olym-
pic and Paralympic teams, as well as

We are grateful to our friends in 
Japan, who have committed tremen-
dous resources to provide safe and se-
cure Games. I have great gratitude for 
these people of Japan, the people of 
that great country, for the enormous 
sacrifice they have made to host the 
world, to demonstrate to the world 
that qualities of the human spirit are 
great indeed, and to make their home a 
place where the entire world comes to 
gather and celebrate the human spirit 
and its accomplishments. 
And while these Games may look a 
little different this year, we stand with 
Team USA and will be cheering them 
on as they bring many medals back 
home. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
MEDICAID SAVES LIVES ACT 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, since 
my first day here in the Senate—and 
even before that—one of the issues I 
have been working to address is how 
my own home State of Georgia, where 
State leaders have been digging in 
their heels, refusing to expand Med-
icaid—how it is that citizens can some-
how provide affordable healthcare to 
their families—nearly 500,000 Georgians 
who are uninsured. They are in the 
Medicaid gap. 
That is why last week I introduced 
the Medicaid Saves Lives Act, legisla-
tion that would create a program al-
most identical to Medicaid that is ad-
ministered by the Federal Government 
and would allow people in States like 
Georgia who have not expanded Med-
icaid, an alternative path to health 
coverage because we know that Med-
icaid literally saves lives. 
I was proud to introduce this legisla-
tion with my colleagues Senators Bald-
win and Ossoff and that it has the sup-
port of healthcare stakeholders in 
Georgia and from across the country. 
Entities like the Georgia Hospital As-
sociation and the Grady Health System 
understand how expanding Medicaid in 
Georgia will improve health outcomes 
across the State, strengthen our rural 
hospitals and healthcare workforce, 
and create good-paying jobs. 
Medicaid saves lives and also saves 
jobs. As it turns out, the right thing to 
do is also the smart thing to do. And so 
I am glad that this plan is on its way 
to being included in the forthcoming 
economic package, and I am going to 
do everything I can to keep pushing to 
make sure that it happens. 
But today, I come to the Senate floor 
to talk not so much about policy as 
much as to talk about the people be-
hind the policy efforts that we lift up. 
We should always endeavor to see the 
human face of the public policy we put 
forward. 
So I want to talk today about Cyn-
thia English. She is a truckdriver in 
Albany, GA. It is a town in the south-
ern rural part of our State. Cynthia 
turns 46 in just a few days. Her birth-
day, actually, is this coming Saturday. 
Happy birthday, Cynthia. 
Cynthia, a hard-working woman, suf-
fers from diabetes and hypertension. 
She says that she has previously ap-
plied for Medicaid and other healthcare 
programs but has been repeatedly de-
nied because she does not have any 
children. She does not have any de-
pendents. So she has been denied, in 
spite of her relatively low income. She 
is in the coverage gap. 
She says that those denials made her 
feel like she couldn’t get any type of 
help. In fact, Cynthia says that in the 
past, her diabetes and her blood pres-
sure have had her in ‘‘real bad shape,’’ 
so much so that complications with her 
diabetes once sent her to the emer-
gency room. 
Think about the cost of that for her 
and for all of us, unable to get the kind 
of routine care that all of us need but 
especially if you have a chronic illness 
like 
hypertension 
or 
diabetes. 
It 
doesn’t make sense for her or for us 
that she is in this situation. Without 
health insurance, Cynthia says she 
couldn’t go to the doctor and that, due 
to the cost, it was hard to pay for 
medication. To put it bluntly, as Cyn-
thia said, when you are sick in Geor-
gia, ‘‘they still really don’t help you if 
you don’t have any health insurance or 
Medicaid.’’ 
Thankfully, Cynthia was able to find 
the Good Samaritan Clinic in Albany. 
As a pastor, I have to say that is a good 
name for a clinic, the Good Samaritan 
Clinic, in Albany. It offers healthcare 
to people like her in the coverage gap. 
She has been able to receive care for 
her conditions, including a pinched 
nerve in her neck and back caused by 
sciatica, another condition that went 
undiagnosed for far too long because of 
her lack of health insurance. 
If it wasn’t for the Good Samaritan 
Clinic, Cynthia says she wouldn’t be 
here. But it is still not enough—grate-
ful for them, but that is not enough. 
That clinic does amazing work, but 
that is not enough. 
In other States, Cynthia would be eli-
gible for Medicaid. According to Cyn-
thia, having additional support pro-
vided by Medicaid would help her pay 
for her medications and get all the care 
that she needs. A hard-working woman, 
doing all the right things, cannot get 
the coverage that she needs. 
So behind the public policy, we have 
to remember the stories of real people, 
people like Cynthia, because there are 
millions of Cynthias in Georgia and 
across our Nation who need the Med-
icaid Saves Lives Act. Until we get this 
done, I am going to keep lifting up 
Cynthia’s story and the stories of other 
Georgians who would benefit from this 
critical lifesaving legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO CHAD RESARI 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday. It is that time of week that 
I like to come down to the Senate floor 
and recognize someone special, some-
one we call our Alaskan of the Week. 
And it is—well, it is part of my, like I 
said, favorite time during the week. 
I think some of our press like it be-
cause it signifies that most people are 
leaving. When we had pages, they loved 
it. But the reason is because you get to 
learn a little bit about Alaska, some 
great stories, some great individuals 
who are usually doing something really 
great for their community, their State, 
sometimes the country, sometimes the 
world. A lot of times, it is people who 
maybe don’t want any recognition but 
deserve it. So I am going to talk about 
our Alaskan of the week, who is 85- 
year-old Chad Resari. And it is a real 
amazing story. 
First, I want to talk a little about 
what is going on in Alaska right now. 
In Anchorage, where our Alaskan of 
the week lives, the sun rose at 5:08 a.m. 
and will set tonight at 11:01 p.m. Now, 
that is a lot of sunlight, a lot of en-
ergy, even though we lost 4 minutes 
and 41 seconds since yesterday. So we 
are losing a lot of daylight, but we still 
have a lot. 
So my message to everybody is: You 
still have time to come up to Alaska, 
bask in the midnight sun—or at least 
midnight twilight, depending on where 
you are. And if you have to wait until 
next year, we would love to have you. 
I would tell you, if you come to Alas-
ka next year, one of the many things 
you should try to see, or even partici-
pate in if you are brave enough, is the 
annual Mount Marathon Race on July 4 
in Seward, AK. It is a race that Chad 
Resari has run 25 times. At 85 years old 
this year, he was officially the oldest 
person to have ever finished this race. 
So competing and finishing any race 
at the age of 85 is impressive. But let 
me tell you why finishing this race at 
that age is truly extraordinary, an in-
spiration to everybody who is watch-
ing—and trust me, he has inspired tens 
of thousands of Alaskans for his feat. 
First, the history: The race dates 
back to 1915 when legend has it two of 
what we call ‘‘sourdoughs’’ were in a 
bar in Seward. By the way, a lot of leg-
ends begin in bars in Alaska. 
So they were wagering how long it 
would take to get up and down the 
3,022-foot peak in Seward, AK—by the 
way, a very steep mountain. One in-
sisted that it could be done in less than 
an hour. The other said, in effect, ‘‘No 
way.’’ The loser was to buy the house a 
round of drinks. Somewhere in there, 
some entrepreneur decided to make it 
a real race, to make it on the Fourth of 
July. And so every year, the Mount 
Marathon Race has happened for over 
100 years now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5040 
July 22, 2021 
The fastest runner in that first race— 
the race where there was a challenge in 
the bar, in 1915—did it in over an hour; 
the legend is one hour and 2 minutes. 
So he lost the bet. He had to buy 
rounds. But the race has lived on. 
Now, the record holder is David Nor-
ris—he is from Anchorage—who ran the 
2016 Mount Marathon in 41 minutes and 
26 seconds. 
David has since won the race two 
more times. 
Now, here is the important thing 
about the race itself. It is more than a 
mile, and half of it is straight up a 
mountain and then back down a moun-
tain, which is more precarious, 11⁄2 
miles. 
Outside magazine calls it ‘‘the tough-
est 5K on the planet’’ Earth. Others use 
less polite words to describe it. But ev-
eryone who knows about the race will 
agree that anyone who takes to the 
mountain and completes it is a rock 
star. This, again, is from Outside mag-
azine. 
If you are watching or you are inter-
ested, Google Mount Marathon race in 
Seward, AK. You will get a sense from 
the pictures. 
Here is what Outside magazine said— 
just a taste of what this race is like. I 
am quoting here: 
That descent from Mount Marathon is sort 
of a controlled dive . . . a hectic sliding rush 
along loose, soft rock— 
Oftentimes there is still snow up 
there— 
. . . it’s part running, part skiing, part fall-
ing, and it often leaves finishers dripping 
with blood or with gravel shrapnel embedded 
in their butts and legs. 
And knees. 
This is the most pure mountain race I can 
think of. It’s straight up and straight down— 
no messing around. 
One of this year’s runners, who is one 
of the few professional runners who 
come from all over the world to run 
this race, he said: 
Alaska doesn’t mess around. 
So that is the race. That is the race 
85-year-old Chad Resari ran 3 weeks 
ago. Thousands of people come out to 
watch it. It is a huge event in Seward. 
Runners from around the world and our 
85-year-old Alaskan just completed it. 
Who is this tough, now-fabled person 
in my State? 
Chad was born in Hawaii. His parents 
are Filipino. He spent most of his 
younger years with his parents on a 
sugar plantation in Maui. He was an 
active kid. He ran with his high school 
running team and, on his off time, 
sometimes ran up mountains. Good 
training for Mount Marathon later in 
his life. 
After high school, he spent 7 years in 
the seminary. He is a deeply religious 
man. At the end of his time, he and his 
mentor decided that he should serve 
God, not as a priest, but as a layperson. 
And as a longtime member of our Lady 
of Guadalupe parish in Anchorage, he 
has stayed faithful to his mission 
since. In fact, my team was talking to 
him yesterday and he was on his way 
to mass, which he does very, very, very 
regularly. 
After the seminary, Chad was open to 
a new experience. Someone told him 
that the wages in Alaska were high, 
$2.50 an hour at the time compared to 
about 90 cents an hour where he was. 
Also, he had a brother in the Army 
stationed in Anchorage, so he said it 
‘‘might be a good idea. Who knows, I 
might even be able to find some 
gold’’—in Alaska—‘‘too.’’ 
Also, he read in Reader’s Digest he 
could grow strawberries in Alaska, 
which is true. So he was intrigued. 
He arrived in Anchorage on March 12, 
1962. It was 15 degrees below zero. Chad 
said: 
The weather was cool. I’ll probably like it 
here. 
He didn’t really like the heat and hu-
midity in Hawaii. 
He initially worked as a custodian at 
Catholic Junior High, then began to 
get interested in coaching students. As 
a pastor at the school took note of his 
interest in teaching, he helped send 
him to then Alaska Methodist Univer-
sity, now Alaska Pacific University, to 
get his teaching degree. 
Until 1966, when Chad retired, he 
taught PE, first at Central Junior 
High, then at Mears Junior High. He 
taught basketball, hockey, soccer, soft-
ball, track and field—you name it. 
Great coach, and he loved working 
with students and teachers and the 
other coaches. 
Throughout those years, and obvi-
ously later, he practiced what he 
preached. Not only did he continue 
running, he lifted weights, winning 
first place in his weight class in a 
power-lifting competition in 1973. 
Although he continued to run and 
stay in shape, he ran the fabled Mount 
Marathon race just twice, in 1963 and 
in 1964, but then he took a long break 
because the training for the race is 
very rigorous and time-consuming. He 
was married then to Edna—49 years 
now—teaching, coaching, raising three 
daughters. He just didn’t have time to 
train for this race. 
But in 1996, after he retired, he start-
ed to train and run Mount Marathon 
again. He began in earnest from that 
time. He has only missed this race 
twice. Once when smoke from forest 
fires made it too dangerous and again 
last year, when the race was canceled 
due to COVID. So he really hasn’t 
missed it at all. 
What is his secret? 
‘‘I’m not sure I have any secret,’’ he 
said. ‘‘My wife is a nurse and she 
makes sure I have my fruits and vege-
tables,’’ and like a lot of Alaskans, ‘‘I 
eat a lot of fish,’’ he said. 
They go to mass daily. They always 
say their evening and morning prayers. 
When they travel, they pray for their 
own safety and the safety for every-
body on the road or on the airplane 
with them. 
‘‘That’s what the Lord would want us 
to do: keep others in mind.’’ 
You can see Chad is a good man, a 
spiritual man. He credits God for giv-
ing him the strength and stamina to do 
what he just did, make it up a 3,000- 
foot mountain, 11⁄2 miles straight up. 
This race, when he was officially the 
oldest person to ever have run it and 
complete it, was very challenging. But 
it was also particularly special for him. 
All across the trail, the people watch-
ing—and when you go to Seward, you 
will see thousands of people—the peo-
ple running the race, the officials, ev-
erybody in Alaska seemed like they 
were cheering Chad on, 85-year-old 
Chad running one of the toughest 5Ks 
on the planet Earth. 
One of his former students, now in 
his 70s, was also there cheering him on. 
This year, his youngest daughter Trina 
also ran the race. Tough family. When 
the finish line was in sight, he could 
see her and his other daughters, Jo-
anna, Sheila, and their children, who 
all ran up to urge him to finish strong, 
get to the finish line. His wife, his 
niece and her husband, his friends were 
all there cheering for him when he 
crossed the finish line of Mount Mara-
thon; 2 hours, 29 minutes, 23 seconds up 
and down a steep mountain in Alaska 
at the tender age of 85 years old. 
It was challenging, he said. And 
after, he was definitely tired. But here 
is the thing. He plans to do it next year 
and the year after that and the year 
after that. He says, as long as he can do 
it, he is going to continue to do it. 
‘‘For some reason, I just enjoy running 
that race,’’ he said. 
So Chad, thank you for being such a 
great inspiration. Thank you for pray-
ing for everybody, keeping your fellow 
Alaskans and Americans in your pray-
ers. 
Congratulations on being the oldest 
person ever to run the fabled Mount 
Marathon race. And, importantly, con-
gratulations for being our Alaskan of 
the Week.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will get 
right to the point: the very definition 
of democracy in the United States is 
under attack. You see it in State legis-
latures across the country. Powerful 
partisans advancing bill after bill to 
restrict voters’ access to the ballot 
box. It flies in the face of the very evo-
lution of progress. 
Gone are the days when voters rode 
on horseback or walked for miles to 
cast their ballot. Technological ad-
vances, commonsense understandings 
of the daily lives of hard-working 
Americans—all these things and more 
recommend an open, accessible, ex-
panded, and secure election process. 
Yet instead of seizing these opportuni-
ties to ensure every voice, every vote 
counts, partisan efforts are afoot to 
take us back—back to a time when 
senseless barriers were erected to block 
the votes of very specific communities. 
The U.S. Senate—the democratically 
elected U.S. Senate—should not stand 
for such an assault on our democracy. 
And every Senator who swears the oath 
of office should stand up and stand 
against this bitter attack on the ballot 
box. 
Protecting the right to vote has long 
been bipartisan. I stood alongside my 
dear friend, himself a soldier in the war 
against voter oppression, John Lewis, 
when 
we 
reauthorized 
the 
Voting 
Rights Act in 2006. And it was with a 
heavy—but hopeful—heart that I re-
introduced the Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act last year to bear his name. I 
will soon do so again. This bipartisan 
legislation should advance, and quick-
ly. 
Now is the time for every American— 
regardless of party, regardless of poli-
tics—to stand in defense of our democ-
racy. To stand for what is right, and to 
stand with the clear arc of history—the 
arc that bends toward justice, toward 
inclusion, towards equality. With one 
loud and clear voice, we should reject 
erosions of voter protections. And we 
should do so now. 
Vermont has always been at the fore-
front of expanding access to the ballot, 
and one of our State’s leaders in that 
fight has been Secretary of State Jim 
Condos. I ask unanimous consent that 
a column by Secretary Condos, pub-
lished in the July 14 edition of The 
Times Argus, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Times Argus, July 14, 2021] 
OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT A CROSSROADS 
(By Jim Condos) 
‘‘The vote is precious. It is the most power-
ful non-violent tool we have in a democratic 
society, and we must use it’’—John Lewis 
This month we celebrated the birth of our 
nation. 
Since its inception, American democracy 
has undergone continual transformation. 
During the past 245 years, many activists 
and advocates have fought tirelessly to ex-
pand the franchise that our democratic 
ideals depend on: the right to vote. 
From suffragettes to civil rights leaders, 
their work has ensured that the march of 
progress has been oriented forward, focused 
on increasing access to the ballot box. 
This Independence Day was an opportunity 
to reflect on the resiliency of our country 
and of our democracy. There has been no 
shortage of challenges during the past year 
and a half. Despite these challenges, we 
achieved record breaking turnout for a gen-
eral election, which nonpartisan experts 
have described as the most secure and the 
most scrutinized election in U.S. history. We 
were able to do so with common-sense voting 
reforms, providing voters with more options 
for receiving and casting their ballot. 
After the ballot counting was completed, 
and the careful town by town certification 
process took place, we had official results 
and a list of election winners and losers, just 
like every other general election in memory. 
Unlike other election years, what has fol-
lowed has brought our democracy to a cross-
roads. Without producing any evidence, the 
former president and his allies have used 
known false voter-fraud claims as justifica-
tion for their attempts to use state legisla-
tures and phony ‘fraudits’ to supersede the 
will of the people and, more significantly, to 
restrict access to the ballot box. 
Our democratic principles should have to 
endure constant debate. However, willfully 
disregarding the certified, official election 
results in an effort to circumvent the will of 
the people and prevent the peaceful transi-
tion of power sets our country on a dan-
gerous path. 
Sending us even further into treacherous 
territory, some state legislatures are using 
‘the Big Lie’ to roll back the voter access ex-
pansions made during 2020, and to further 
suppress voting rights through measures 
such as the implementation of more restric-
tive voter ID laws, limits on the ballot-by- 
mail request period, elimination or reduc-
tion in ballot drop boxes, and closure of poll-
ing precincts. 
After record-breaking turnout in 2020, and 
with zero evidence of widespread fraud or 
election rigging, why would they want to 
make it harder for eligible Americans to 
vote? The answer is simple: because they 
were unhappy with the results and want 
fewer people to vote. 
Overall, there have been over 350 bills in-
troduced in 47 states with the sole purpose of 
reducing access to the ballot. In June alone, 
17 state legislatures enacted 28 new voter re-
striction laws. A small few include reason-
able, understandable reforms. 
Most make no sense at all. It is clear that 
some lawmakers would prefer to pick their 
voters, rather than voters picking their rep-
resentatives. 
Frankly, I am concerned for our nation. 
We stand at a crossroads, and the decisions 
we make now will ripple throughout time. 
There is hope. In Vermont, we saw the 
record turnout as a positive, so we made the 
mailing of ballots to all voters a permanent 
fixture of Vermont general elections. We 
also created a new pathway for voters to cor-
rect a defective ballot so that their vote will 
count. We did this by working across the 
aisles with the support of Democrats, Repub-
licans, Progressives and independents. 
In the face of the alarming rise in state- 
level attacks on voting rights, we cannot af-
ford to wait for solutions one-by-one in all 50 
states. With the gutting of the Voting Rights 
Act by the Supreme Court, we no longer 
have the luxury of a ‘‘wait and see’’ ap-
proach. Congress can, and must, create min-
imum voter access and fairness standards 
that states must abide by, so that eligible 
voters are not being denied their voting 
rights. 
The true voter fraud in this country is de-
nying any eligible American their right to 
register and vote. 
Congress alone can put an end to restric-
tive and unnecessary obstacles to voting, 
prohibit 
racebased 
and 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering, make automatic, online and 
same day voter registration the law of the 
land, and make voting by mail accessible for 
every voter, regardless of which side of an in-
visible line you live on. 
Two federal bills pending, the For the Peo-
ple Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, give Congress this oppor-
tunity to act. The time has come for the par-
tisan, political games to stop. Those who are 
prioritizing the promotion of politically mo-
tivated falsehoods about the security of our 
elections, over the voting rights of the peo-
ple who put them in office, are committing a 
severe dereliction of duty. 
In 2021, our democracy has come to a cross-
roads. Fortunately, we have a roadmap, we 
just need to follow it.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since the 
start of the pandemic, the State of 
Vermont, at every level of its leader-
ship, has taken heroic efforts to miti-
gate spread of the deadly COVID–19 
virus. With strong leadership from Gov. 
Phil Scott, and bolstered by a firm be-
lief in scientific facts, the State nearly 
halted altogether the spread of COVID– 
19, 
minimized 
the 
number 
of 
Vermonters lost to the disease, and 
now leads the Nation in the percentage 
of residents who have received at least 
one vaccine shot. As we look to hope-
fully soon be on the other side of this 
pandemic, I strongly believe that there 
are invaluable lessons to be learned 
from Vermont’s response, so that we 
are better prepared for the days, 
months, and years ahead.

Dakota’s COVID Infection Rates are

took to not only protect the health of 
its residents but also ensure that mini-

the circumstances. A strong public 
health 
approach, 
led 
by 
Vermont 
Health Commissioner Mark Levine, al-
ways communicated scientific evidence 
clearly and thoughtfully. This fostered 
a sense of trust and community that 
has now resulted in Vermont nearing 
herd immunity and able to fully reopen 
local businesses for everyone to enjoy. 
I am so proud of every Vermonter 
who stepped up to do their part to not 
only protect themselves, but their fam-
ilies, friends, and neighbors. This is 
truly the Vermont way. I know that if 
all States followed Vermont’s example, 
and continued to vaccinate all resi-
dents, we would be able to put this 
dark chapter of American history in 
our rearview mirror. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the article men-
tioned above, about the important 
work in Vermont to protect our State 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

[From the Washington Post, July 13, 2021] 
VERMONT’S AND SOUTH DAKOTA’S COVID IN-
FECTION RATES ARE REMARKABLY SIMILAR— 
BUT THEIR OUTCOMES ARE NOT 
(By Ashish K. Jha) 
Two states. Two different paths in respond-
ing to COVID–19. Together, they offer invalu-
able lessons about the road ahead for the na-
tion—especially as infection rates creep up 
because of the delta variant. 
The two states are Vermont and South Da-
kota. Both feature among the three states 
that COVID Act Now classifies as falling in 
the lowest-risk category, along with Massa-
chusetts. This may be a surprise. While New 
England states are known to have done ex-
traordinarily well in vaccinating their popu-
lations, South Dakota is in the middle of the 
pack. So, what explains the fact that South 
Dakota has infection numbers almost as low 
as Vermont, the most vaccinated state in the 
nation? 
Let’s start with some basics. Vermont and 
South Dakota share several important simi-
larities. Both have relatively White, older 
and rural populations. They have comparable 
median incomes. Both states have Repub-
lican governors, challenging the simplistic 
notion that COVID risk is a partisan phe-
nomenon. 
Over the past two months, the rates of in-
fection in Vermont and South Dakota have 
appeared remarkably similar. Both states 
have seen steep declines in cases, making 
both states near the best in terms of infec-
tions per population. 
But this is where the similarity ends. 
While nearly 75 percent of Vermonters have 
had at least one vaccine shot, putting the 
state near the threshold for herd immunity, 
only half of South Dakotans have had at 
least one shot. South Dakota’s substantial 
population immunity instead comes in large 
part from prior infections, particularly dur-
ing the fall. This massive surge in infections 
was driven by the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally 
in August that brought nearly half a million 
people to South Dakota, sparking outbreaks 
across that state and, indeed, the nation. 
With little to no interest on the part of its 
governor to squelch the outbreak, South Da-
kota reached the highest levels of infection 
seen by any state during the pandemic. At 
its peak, the state was reporting more than 
160 new cases per 100,000 residents. Vermont, 
in comparison, never climbed above 30 cases 
per 100,000. 
Unsurprisingly, these states experienced 
stunningly different outcomes. Adjusted for 
population, nearly six times as many people 
died in South Dakota from covid–19 as in 
Vermont (230 per 100,000 in South Dakota 
compared to just 40 per 100,000 in Vermont). 
In real numbers, while about 250 Vermont 
residents died from the disease. more than 
2,000 South Dakotans died. And as of today, 
Vermont has a lower unemployment rate, 
suggesting that there need not be any trade- 
off between public health and the economy. 
By some estimates, nearly half of the peo-
ple of South Dakota may have been infected. 
These infections led to huge amounts of suf-
fering beyond the deaths themselves. We are 
seeing an increasing body of evidence that 
many who survive serious illness from the 
virus have long-term complications and 
symptoms. When infections spike, a run on 
hospital beds means other people die because 
they can’t access hospital care, which almost 
surely occurred in South Dakota at the 
height of the surge. Vermont took a different 
approach, keeping public health measures in 
place to keep infections low and then, build-
ing up population immunity through excel-
lent vaccination campaigns. 
The virus isn’t going away. In fact, it is 
likely to become endemic, meaning it will 
continue to circulate, occasionally causing 
outbreaks in low-vaccination communities. 
Most people will encounter the virus at one 
point or another. And if they don’t have im-
munity from vaccines, many will get sick. 
The harms from infection are large, espe-
cially in comparison to the generally mild 
side-effects of the vaccines. And there is 
some evidence that the vaccine-induced im-
munity is more effective than natural infec-
tion-induced immunity. As the highly con-
tagious delta variant spreads, states that 
have experienced high levels of infection 
such as South Dakota may be more vulner-
able than highly vaccinated states such as 
Vermont. 
In the spring of 2020, governors had to 
make decisions with little federal guidance 
and little historical precedent. But by that 
summer, it was much clearer how to curtail 
the disease, protect public health and man-
age the economy carefully. By following the 
science, Vermont saved an enormous number 
of lives and has now reached a degree of pop-
ulation immunity through vaccination that 
makes large outbreaks unlikely. Embracing 
a policy of ‘‘personal responsibility,’’ South 
Dakota did little to protect its residents, 
leading to the deaths of more than 2,000 
South Dakotans and the suffering of tens of 
thousands more. To avoid more unnecessary 
outbreaks, we need to learn from states that 
have successfully weathered the pandemic, 
follow the science and keep vaccinating 
Americans. 
f 
REMEMBERING HARRY CHAPIN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has 
been 40 years since the Nation lost a 
champion for the hungry, and the 
American people lost a talented and in-
spirational musical artist. And I lost a 
dear partner and friend. 
I was proud to have been able to 
work side by side with Harry Chapin on 
several projects to address hunger, here 
at 
home, 
and 
in 
the 
world. 
We 
strategized. We met with other Sen-
ators to build support. And I got to 
know him well. He stayed at our home 
and even sang for our enthralled chil-
dren. I was with him on the grounds of 
the Capitol Building when he pulled 
out his guitar and gave an impromptu 
concert. Passersby were drawn to him, 
and it was one more magical moment, 
among so many with Harry. 
Harry had incredible energy and 
drive and commitment to his goals. 
Bill Ayres, a former Catholic priest 
who 
cofounded 
the 
organization 
WhyHunger with Harry, has noted that 
Harry used to say: ‘‘When in doubt, do 
something.’’ And do something, he cer-
tainly did. Since its founding in 1975, 
WhyHunger has raised more than $30 
million to help more than 10 million 
families, children, veterans, and others 
around the world gain access to nutri-
tious food and vital services. 
One of Harry’s ideas was to convince 
President Jimmy Carter to form a 
Commission on world hunger. I readily 
signed on to help him. When we had 
that meeting with the President in the 
Cabinet Room, Harry’s persistence was 
on overdrive. President Carter agreed 
to establish the Commission. So that 
goal was in hand. But Harry kept tell-
ing the President why we should do 
this, and President Carter kept trying 
to tell Harry that he agreed with him. 
Harry was wound up and excited to 
have the chance to lay out the case for 
a Commission. And I finally said: 
‘‘Harry, don’t talk him out of it.’’ Ev-
eryone laughed because we all knew 
that it was a moment that distilled the 
pure energy for which we all loved and 
admired him. 
I worked with Senator Byron Dorgan 
and others in gaining authorization for 
a Congressional Gold Medal, which I 
was honored to carry to a memorial 
concert at Carnegie Hall to present to 
Harry’s family. Harry Belafonte and 
Bruce Springsteen were there and so 
were so many others who had known 
and 
worked 
with 
Harry. 
Harry 
Belafonte, whom I also admire so deep-
ly, has said this: 
I grew to really admire him, not only for 
his commitment to the cause of hunger, but 
also the fact that he did it with such passion, 
such real commitment. As an artist, I cer-
tainly loved his work. Not only his music, 
but the content of his words. He spoke about 
the human condition with a sense of humor 
and as a lyricist he had his hand on the pulse 
of social needs. 
A few years ago, I received a letter 
from a 16-year-old Canadian boy in 
Newmarket, Ontario, Ryan Kruger. He 
had heard about my work with Harry 
and wanted me to know how much he 
admires him. 
‘‘I am a big fan of Harry,’’ he wrote, 
‘‘and think he exemplifies the ideals of 
both of our respective nations, as well 
as the world, or at least what they 
should be. In this volatile political cli-
mate, on both sides of the border, as 
well as around the world, I think we 
need a bit more Harry.’’ 
And we certainly do. 
Harry’s children wrote an eloquent 
tribute that was carried in the New 
York Daily News on July 16. They, and 
many of us, want to keep alight and 
aloft the candle that helps Harry 
Chapin’s important legacy live on and 
on. 
I commend their tribute to the atten-
tion of the Senate.

I ask unanimous consent to have the 
article printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Daily News, July 16, 
2021] 
HOW HARRY CHAPIN, OUR DAD, FOUGHT 
HUNGER 
(By Josh Chapin, Jen Chapin, Jason Chapin, 
Jono Chapin and Jaime Chapin) 
For many, attaining fame and fortune is 
enough to feel successful. For our father, 
Harry Chapin, it wasn’t. His true fulfillment 
came through service, and 40 years following 
his untimely death, along with his timeless 
hit song ‘‘Cat’s in the Cradle,’’ our dad’s pas-
sionate commitment to ending hunger is 
what he is best remembered for. During his 
life (1942–1981), he released 11 albums, per-
formed 220 concerts a year, and received 
Grammy and Oscar nominations as well as 
Emmy, Tony and many other awards, includ-
ing the Congressional Gold Medal. While 
music was his passion, our father’s success 
became not laurels to rest upon but rather a 
platform that led to his becoming one of the 
leading humanitarians of his generation. 
Through starting three dynamic and vi-
sionary organizations in his short lifetime, 
WhyHunger, Long Island Cares and the Cen-
ter for Food Action in New Jersey, he left a 
lasting impact in the fight against hunger 
and poverty. 
Today marks 40 years since our father’s 
passing in an automobile accident on the 
Long Island Expressway. It’s been four dec-
ades without him—four decades of change in 
culture, politics, music and technology—but 
after all that change, and even a global pan-
demic, his legacy organizations WhyHunger 
and Long Island Cares remain centered on 
fulfilling our dad’s mission of deeply under-
standing the root causes of hunger and seek-
ing solutions grounded in community power 
and self-reliance. 
Notably, during his lifetime, our father 
worked with President Jimmy Carter, his 
dear friend and Democratic Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, Republican Sen. Bob Dole, and a bi-
partisan team to form the first and only 
Presidential Commission on World Hunger. 
Our father’s work to create political urgency 
and a truly patriotic, bipartisan dialogue 
surrounding the human right to nutritious 
food—in our wealthy nation and in a world 
that can feed itself many times over—should 
be a call to inspire a new surge of commit-
ment today. 
While he embarked on a mission decades 
ago to combat hunger, the work is far from 
complete. Today, nearly 2.1 million New 
Yorkers face hunger every day. On Long Is-
land, nearly half a million face the same re-
ality—a problem that’s many times worse 
than when he started Long Island Cares in 
1980. These statistics are staggering, and 
sadly have increased over recent years. 
While prior to COVID–19, Long Island neared 
a 40% reduction of food insecurity, during 
the height of the pandemic, an additional 
223,000 Long Islanders became food insecure, 
nearly doubling the prior population count. 
A generous charitable response and a mas-
sive, industrialized emergency food system 
are not enough. What our father understood 
years ago is that in order to ameliorate this 
needless suffering, we need to address the 
root causes and advance the human right to 
nutritious food in the U.S. and around the 
world. Hunger in the U.S. and hunger around 
the world are deeply connected, and thanks 
to the work of WhyHunger and our diverse 
array of partners, exciting alliances are 
building self-reliance and lasting change. 
WhyHunger has shown that by offering crit-
ical resources to support grassroots move-
ments, we can build community solutions 
rooted in social, environmental, racial and 
economic justice. 
Our hope is that the current administra-
tion is prepared to substantively address 
these issues and do what our father knew 
was, and still is, possible: bring an end to 
hunger. Currently, Rep. James McGovern of 
Massachusetts is asking President Biden to 
convene a new White House Conference on 
Hunger, just as our father pushed for four 
decades ago. When asked what his motiva-
tion was for this cause, McGovern said that 
meeting Harry left a lasting impression on 
his political views on hunger. 
What 
Harry 
Chapin 
began 
with 
WhyHunger, Long Island Cares and the Cen-
ter for Food Action continues to make a 
great impact, but of course there is more to 
be done. More organizations need to realize 
that fighting hunger is not only about hand-
ing out food in times of need, or even the 
proverbial teaching people to fish—it is 
about supporting social movements so that 
people can organize, advocate and work to-
gether to ensure they will always be able to 
feed their families. Additionally, we need to 
keep speaking up for social and legislative 
reform that promotes social and economic 
justice. If you happened to love our father’s 
music and message, if you care about Amer-
ica reaching its yet unrealized mission of 
justice for all, or if you want to live in a 
more peaceful and sustainable world, con-
sider this a call to action.

Harry Chapin.

rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder 
where the 13th pair of chromosomes have an 
extra copy creating three chromosomes. 
Trisomy 13 is the least common and most se-
vere of the feasible autosomal trisomies. Me-
dian survival is fewer than three days. It af-
fects one in every 8,000 to 12,000 live births. 
Babies born with Trisomy 13 can have 
many health problems and more than 80 per-
cent don’t survive more than a few weeks. 
Between 86 percent and 91 percent of live 
births do not live past their first year. Sur-
vival beyond the first year is associated with 
mosaicism. There is no cure for Trisomy 13 
but different treatments depend on the 
symptoms. In most cases surgery and ther-
apy are the best options. Prenatal testing 
and ultrasound can confirm a Trisomy 13 di-
agnosis through amniocentesis.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–24. A joint memorial adopted by the 
legislature of the State of Colorado urging 
the Department of Defense to keep the 
United 
States 
Space 
Command 
(USSPACECOM) in Colorado; to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 21–001 
Whereas, Our nation and the world have 
significantly benefitted from technological 
and scientific advances resulting from space 
exploration and aerospace activities, and 
Colorado is paving the way for new discov-
eries in the frontiers of space by having a 
rich history in aerospace development and 
being at the forefront of space travel, explo-
ration, and aerospace research; and 
Whereas, Colorado is the acting provisional 
Space Command Base and it will remain the 
provisional base until 2023. Colorado is also 
the center for United States military space 
operations and strategy. According to the 
Colorado Space Coalition (CSC), the state’s 
military commands are the primary cus-
tomers for space-based research, develop-
ment, acquisitions, and operations, rep-
resenting nearly 90 percent of space-related 
expenditure by the military. Moving the 
United 
States 
Space 
Command 
(USSP 
ACECOM) to Huntsville, Alabama, will be in-
credibly disruptive to the National Defense 
Strategy. In addition, it will cause a major 
upheaval in existing infrastructure and jobs 
in the state, which will result in higher costs 
and less efficient outcomes for the United 
States military; and 
Whereas, Colorado is strategically located 
at the center of our national and space de-
fense. We are the home to five key strategic 
military commands: North American Aero-
space Defense Command (NORAD), United 
States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), 
United States Strategic Command’s Joint 
Functional Component Command for Space 
(JFCC Space) Missile Warning Center, the 
United States Air Force Space Command, 
and the United States Army Space and Mis-
sile Defense Command/Army Forces Stra-
tegic Command; and five military installa-
tions, including United States Air Force 
bases Buckley, Cheyenne Mountain, Peter-
son, and Schriever, as well as Fort Carson 
Army Base; and 
Whereas, The 460th Space Wing at Buckley 
Air Force Base provides operational com-
mand and control of three constellations to 
space-based infrared missile warning sys-
tems, has been defending America continu-
ously since 1970, and is a critical part of 
global defense and national security; and 
Whereas, Colorado leads the charge in 
bringing current and future global posi-
tioning system (GPS) assets to life, a service 
provided free to the world by Air Force 
Space Command in Colorado Springs. From 
the operation of GPS satellites by Schriever 
Air Force Base to GPS III, the most powerful 
GPS satellite to date—being designed and 
built by Lockheed Martin and launched by 
United Launch Alliance with Raytheon de-
veloping the command and control capabili-
ties, and with companies such as Boeing, 
Harris Corporation, Braxton Technologies, 
and Infinity Systems Engineering also sup-
porting GPS development and operations 
from locations in Colorado, GPS tech-
nologies enable an integral part of our global 
economy to have an incalculable impact that 
has improved the everyday lives of billions 
of people around the world; and 
Whereas, Colorado’s aerospace industry is 
home to a broad range of companies that cre-
ate products and systems for commercial, 
military, and civil space applications, such 
as spacecraft, launch vehicles, satellites, 
command and control software, sensors, and 
navigation operations. These companies in-
clude Ball Aerospace, Boeing, DigitalGlobe, 
Harris Corporation, Lockheed Martin Space 
Systems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Si-
erra Nevada Corporation, Teledyne Brown 
Engineering, and United Launch Alliance, 
which make up a large portion of the aero-
space sector; and 
Whereas, Colorado has an existing edu-
cated workforce, ranked second in the nation 
with residents with a bachelor’s degree or 
higher, and a pipeline of higher education in-
stitutions to sustain future growth. We are 
home to the United States Air Force Acad-
emy and many colleges and universities, in-
cluding the University of Colorado Boulder 
and the University of Colorado Colorado 
Springs, Colorado School of Mines, Colorado 
State University, Metropolitan State Uni-
versity of Denver, University of Denver, Col-
orado Mesa University, and Fort Lewis Col-
lege. Altogether, they provide access to 
world-class aerospace-related degrees and 
offer aerospace companies one of the coun-
try’s most educated workforces; and 
Whereas, Colorado is home to some amaz-
ing research institutions. These institutions 
include the prestigious Laboratory for At-
mospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the 
University of Colorado Boulder. It began in 
1948, a decade before NASA, and is the 
world’s only research institute to have sent 
instruments to all eight planets and to 
Pluto, combining all aspects of space explo-
ration through science, engineering, mission 
operations, and scientific data analysis; and

July 22, 2021 
Whereas, Colorado is also home to the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction 
Center, a world-leading center of predictions 
for the solar and near-Earth space environ-
ment and the nation’s official source of 
watches, warnings, and alerts of incoming 
solar storms, using satellite observations to 
protect and save lives and property; and 
Whereas, Various organizations are key to 
Colorado’s prominence in aerospace, such as 
the Colorado Space Coalition, a group of in-
dustry stakeholders working to make Colo-
rado a center of excellence for aerospace; the 
Colorado Space Business Roundtable, work-
ing to bring together aerospace stakeholders 
from the industry, government, and aca-
demia for roundtable discussions and busi-
ness development and to encourage grass-
roots citizen participation in aerospace 
issues; the Colorado chapter of Citizens for 
Space Exploration, whose mission is to pro-
mote better understanding of aerospace and 
its importance in our economy and daily 
lives, as well as to promote the importance 
of human space exploration; Manufacturer’s 
Edge, a statewide manufacturing assistance 
center that encourages the strength and 
competitiveness of Colorado manufacturers 
by providing on-site technical assistance 
through coaching, training, and consulting, 
by providing collaboration-focused industry 
programs, and by leveraging government, 
university, and economic development part-
nerships; and the Space Foundation, founded 
in 1983, with its world headquarters in Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado, which holds an an-
nual Space Symposium, bringing together 
civil, commercial, and national security 
space leaders from around the world to dis-
cuss, address, and plan for the future of 
space; and 
Whereas, For the aforementioned reasons, 
it is in the best interests of the American 
taxpayer to keep USSPACECOM in the state 
because Colorado is already fulfilling the 
mission of the USSPACECOM; because Colo-
rado Springs has in place the community in-
frastructure capacity and community sup-
port to champion an expanding mission; be-
cause the move will cost the United States 
billions of dollars to relocate the facility; 
and because the move would severely disrupt 
the Colorado aerospace industry, which has 
grown to support the mission: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Seventy- 
third General Assembly of the State of Colo-
rado, the House of Representatives concur-
ring herein: 
That we, the members of the General As-
sembly: 
(1) Recognizing Colorado’s unique blend of 
military installations and major commands, 
private aerospace companies, academic and 
research institutions, and government enti-
ties, and the valuable synergies this eco-
system produces, strongly urge the Depart-
ment of Defense and the incoming Biden- 
Harris administration to reevaluate the mer-
its of this irresponsible decision and should 
rightly conclude that it is the correct deci-
sion to keep the existing United States 
Space Command in Colorado; 
(2) Furthermore, strongly urge the Depart-
ment of Defense and the incoming presi-
dential administration to permanently base 
the 
United 
States 
Space 
Command 
(USSPACECOM) in Colorado, recognizing 
that Colorado provides the existing com-
mand structure, base infrastructure, and 
communications platforms necessary to suc-
cessfully host additional national security 
initiatives and ensure coordination of efforts 
without committing additional funds; 
(3) Proudly express that Colorado has deep 
ties with the Department of Defense and im-
mense patriotic commitment to providing 
for the nation’s security and bolstering our 
defense; 
(4) Express our most sincere and deepest 
appreciation to our service members and ci-
vilian employees working in and supporting 
military and civilian aerospace companies, 
military installations, and civil organiza-
tions in Colorado; and 
(5) Hereby declare Colorado to be the prime 
location for the permanent headquarters for 
USSPACECOM. Be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this Senate Joint 
Memorial be sent to President-elect Joseph 
R. Biden, Jr.; Vice President-elect Kamala 
Harris; Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi; Con-

POM–25. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota urging the United States Congress to 
pass the North Dakota Trust Lands Comple-
tion Act; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4013 
Whereas, upon statehood in 1889, North Da-
kota was granted 2.6 million acres of scat-
tered lands and minerals with the purpose of 
funding education and public needs within 
the state; and 
Whereas, establishment of tribal nations 
and the Little Missouri National Grasslands 
trapped state-owned lands and minerals 
within these boundaries which often are very 
difficult for North Dakota to access and 
manage; and 
Whereas, North Dakota currently holds 
over 130,000 acres of minerals and over 31,000 
surface acres within tribal nations alone, 
which are largely unable to be developed by 
the state pursuant to North Dakota’s man-
date to generate income for schools, univer-
sities, and other public purposes; and 
Whereas, authorizing North Dakota to re-
linquish North Dakota land grant parcels lo-
cated within tribal nations and the grass-
lands and to select other federal lands or 
minerals in lieu of not receiving full access 
to and use of the original land since North 
Dakota attained statehood will fulfill the 
promise of land and minerals to North Da-
kota, provide to Indian tribes greater tribal 
sovereignty and control of lands and min-
erals within tribal nations, and provide for 
greater conservation and preservation of the 
grasslands; and 
Whereas, Congress should authorize North 
Dakota to relinquish the lands and minerals 
located within tribal nations and the grass-
lands; and to select in lieu of the relin-
quished land other federal lands or minerals 
within North Dakota of equal value: Now, 
therefore, be it resolved by the Senate of North 
Dakota, the House of Representatives Concur-
ring Therein: 
That the Sixty-seventh Legislative Assem-
bly urges the Congress of the United States 
to pass the North Dakota Trust Lands Com-
pletion Act; and be it further 
Resolved, that the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
President Pro Tempore of the United States 
Senate, the United States Secretary of the 
Interior, and each member of the North Da-
kota Congressional Delegation. 
POM–26. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the President of the United States to 
end the pause on offshore oil and natural gas 
leasing and allow for the continued explo-
ration, development, and production of oil 
and natural gas resources in the Gulf of Mex-
ico; to the Committee on Energy and Nat-
ural Resources. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 71 
Whereas, the oil and natural gas industry 
has historically provided thousands of high- 
paying jobs for Louisianans working in pro-
duction or transportation of oil and natural 
gas, generating millions of dollars in annual 
revenue for state and local programs, and de-
creasing America’s dependence on imported 
oil; and 
Whereas, recent action by the federal gov-
ernment has paused offshore oil and natural 
gas leasing and stopped pipeline develop-
ment; and 
Whereas, an extended leasing ban would 
greatly diminish investment and activity in 
Gulf of Mexico production and result in sub-
stantial, irreplaceable job losses and loss of 
revenue to the state and its communities; 
and 
Whereas, Gulf of Mexico production pro-
vides the only annual recurring revenue from 
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, 
more commonly referred to as GOMESA, a 
standing revenue sharing arrangement; and 
Whereas, under the GOMESA revenue shar-
ing provisions, Gulf oil and gas producing 
states, including Louisiana, split 37.5 percent 
of qualified outer continental shelf revenues 
and 12.5 percent of revenues are directed to 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
stateside program, through which states can 
receive up to $125 million a year in grants; 
and 
Whereas, the GOMESA revenues fund vital 
coastal protection and restoration programs 
as set forth by the Coastal Protection and 
Restoration Authority’s Master Plan for a 
Sustainable Coast; and 
Whereas, an Obama Administration report 
from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Manage-
ment analyzing the effects of offshore leas-
ing restrictions found that United States 
greenhouse gas emissions would be little af-
fected and would increase globally in the ab-
sence of new offshore leasing due to in-
creased foreign imports; and 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico has the lowest 
carbon intensity in the world in terms of 
emissions, other than Saudi Arabia, and 
would be lower than Saudi imports, with 
1,274,450 barrels of oil or 62 percent of all 2021 
Gulf of Mexico deepwater production being 
produced by a public corporation with an ex-
isting net zero pledge; and 
Whereas, the oil and natural gas industry 
has invested over $108 billion in greenhouse 
gas mitigating technologies contributing to 
a sharp decline in emission of CO2 in the 
United States; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5046 
July 22, 2021 
Whereas, from 2000 to 2018, emissions de-
clined 67 percent in the United Sates relative 
to oil and gas production; and 
Whereas, in the same period of time, the 
carbon dioxide emissions in the rest of the 
world increased by 29 percent; and 
Whereas, the 2020 Louisiana Emissions 
Analysis, published by the Consumer Energy 
Alliance, a leading voice for sensible energy 
policies for families and businesses, found 
that emissions declined by 71 percent across 
the state since 1990; and 
Whereas, during that same period of emis-
sions reduction, Louisiana’s gross domestic 
product surged 177 percent; and 
Whereas, pipeline transportation provides 
a consumer-friendly and intrinsically safer 
mode of transportation compared to others 
that have higher emissions; and 
Whereas, restricting pipeline development 
results in higher costs to consumers and 
higher transportation emissions; and 
Whereas, because projections show energy 
demand will continue to rise, restricting de-
velopment on federal lands and waters is 
nothing more than an ‘‘import more oil’’ pol-
icy forcing the United States to rely on im-
ports from sometimes hostile foreign coun-
tries with lower environmental standards; 
and 
Whereas, broad and predictable access to 
offshore oil and natural gas resources will 
help support and grow more jobs and activity 
in Louisiana and the Gulf region, reduce 
America’s reliance on overseas imports, and 
increase revenues to the state and its local-
ities. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the administra-
tion of President Biden to immediately end 
its pause on offshore oil and natural gas leas-
ing and allow for the continued exploration, 
development, and production of oil and nat-
ural gas resources in the Gulf of Mexico; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
also expresses its support for the ongoing de-
velopment of America’s superior pipeline 
transportation network to the benefit of 
American consumers and American workers 
and allow the inherent economic benefits 
thereof to be fully realized; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the president of the United 
States, each member of the president’s cabi-
net, and to the members of the capitol press 
corps. 
POM–27. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey 
urging the United States Congress to pass 
the ‘‘Retired Pay Restoration Act’’; to the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 260 
Whereas, A 19th Century law requires mili-
tary retired pay to be offset, dollar for dol-
lar, by the amount of disability compensa-
tion received from the United States Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA); and 
Whereas, Military retired pay earned by 
service and sacrifice in defending the United 
States should not be reduced because a mili-
tary retiree is also eligible for veterans’ dis-
ability compensation awarded for a service- 
connected disability; and 
Whereas, Retired pay and disability com-
pensation are different types of compensa-
tion—retired pay is provided to recognize a 
career of uniformed service while VA dis-
ability compensation is compensation for 
pain, suffering, and lost future earning power 
due to service-connected disabilities; and 
Whereas, The ‘‘Retired Pay Restoration 
Act’’ pending before Congress would permit 
retired members of the Armed Forces who 
have a service-connected disability to re-
ceive both military retired pay by reason of 
their years of military service and disability 
compensation from the VA; and 
Whereas, Service members make countless 
sacrifices in service to this country and 
State and should not be forced to forfeit 
their military retired pay because a 19th 
Century law reduces their retirement benefit 
by the amount they receive in disability 
compensation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State 
of New Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges the United 
States Congress to pass the ‘‘Retired Pay 
Restoration Act.’’ 
2. Copies of the resolution, as filed with the 
Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by 
the Clerk of the General Assembly to the 
President and Vice-President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the United States House 
of Representatives, and every member of 
Congress elected from this State. 
POM–28. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey 
urging the United States Congress and Presi-
dent of the United States to pass and enact 
the ‘‘Disabled Veterans Tax Termination 
Act’’; to the Committee on Armed Services. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 262 
Whereas, The State is home to approxi-
mately 355,000 U.S. military veterans; and 
Whereas, Under current federal law, a mili-
tary veteran with a service-connected dis-
ability can only claim concurrent retirement 
and disability pay if the veteran has a serv-
ice-connected disability rating of 50 percent 
or higher; and 
Whereas, Disability rating is a percentage 
assigned by the federal Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to reflect the severity of a vet-
eran’s disability; and 
Whereas, Concurrent retirement and dis-
ability pay allows military veterans to claim 
military retirement pay without having the 
retirement pay offset by the amount of dis-
ability compensation that those veterans re-
ceive; and 
Whereas, Under current federal law, a mili-
tary veteran not receiving concurrent retire-
ment and disability pay has his or her mili-
tary retirement pay reduced dollar for dollar 
by the amount received from veteran dis-
ability compensation; and 
Whereas, A military veteran who is enti-
tled to both retirement pay and disability 
compensation should not be subject to a re-
tirement pay reduction for receiving dis-
ability compensation; and 
Whereas, The federal ‘‘Disabled Veterans 
Tax Termination Act’’ would allow a veteran 
with a disability rating lower than 50 per-
cent to receive concurrent retirement and 
disability pay; and 
Whereas, Currently, a military veteran 
under Chapter 61 can only claim concurrent 
retirement and disability pay if the veteran 
has at least 20 years of service; and 
Whereas, A Chapter 61 military veteran is 
one who retires from the military due to a 
service-connected disability and whose dis-
ability rating is 30 percent or higher; and 
Whereas, The federal ‘‘Disabled Veterans 
Tax Termination Act’’ would allow a mili-
tary veteran under Chapter 61 with less than 
20 years of service to receive concurrent re-
tirement and disability pay; and 
Whereas, The federal government should 
not limit the amount of retirement pay a 
military veteran receives just because the 
military veteran also receives disability 
compensation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State 
of New Jersey: 
1. This House urges the Congress and Presi-
dent of the United States to pass and enact 
the ‘‘Disabled Veterans Tax Termination 
Act.’’ 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Clerk of the General Assembly, shall be 
transmitted by the Clerk of the General As-
sembly to the President and Vice President 
of the United States, the Majority and Mi-
nority Leaders of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker and Minority Leader of the 
House of Representatives, and each member 
of the United States Congress elected from 
this State. 
POM–29. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of New Mexico re-
questing the United States Congress and the 
President of the United States to base pay-
ments in lieu of taxes on a full property tax 
equivalency basis; to the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 2 
Whereas, payments in lieu of taxes are fed-
eral payments to local governments that 
help offset losses in property taxes due to 
the existence of nontaxable federal lands 
within their boundaries; and 
Whereas, according to the United States 
Department of the Interior, New Mexico has 
twenty-two million three hundred sixty-nine 
thousand five hundred thirty-one acres of 
land eligible for payments in lieu of taxes; 
and 
Whereas, New Mexico received forty-one 
million 
four 
hundred 
thousand 
dollars 
($41,400,000) of payments in lieu of taxes from 
the Federal Government in Fiscal Year 2020; 
and 
Whereas, technology now exists to more 
accurately 
determine 
the 
property 
tax 
equivalency value of all federal lands in the 
State; and 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, when the Federal Govern-
ment changed its public lands policy in 1976 
from one of disposal to one of retention, Con-
gress agreed to make payments in lieu of 
taxes ‘‘to make up for the presence of non-
taxable land’’ on a ‘‘tax equivalency’’ basis; 
and 
Whereas, 
tax 
equivalency 
means 
the 
amount that would have been received by 
these jurisdictions if the federal lands were 
privately owned; and 
Whereas, the Federal commitment to pay 
the property tax equivalency for payments 
in lieu of taxes is vital for New Mexico’s 
children and communities and is particu-
larly important during periods of fluctuating 
economic conditions; and 
Whereas, New Mexico appreciates every 
dollar of payments in lieu of taxes received, 
yet the payments in lieu of taxes that New 
Mexico receives are not the fair property tax 
equivalency value, resulting in exponentially 
compounding depressive impacts on funding 
for education and essential government serv-
ices, including first responder services, the 
construction of roads, schools and other in-
frastructure and search and rescue services; 
and 
Whereas, the current fluctuating economic 
conditions have intensified this structural 
burden borne by New Mexico residents and 
communities to fund education and all other 
government services; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Legislature of the State of 
New Mexico that it call upon the United 
States Congress and the President of the 
United States to base payments in lieu of 
taxes on a full property tax equivalency 
basis, as committed at the inception of the 
payment in lieu of taxes program; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of the State 
of New Mexico call upon the United States 
Congress and the President of the United 
States to coordinate expeditiously and in

good faith with New Mexico and other will-
ing states to adopt such laws, regulations 
and policies as are necessary to ensure that 
all future payments in lieu of taxes are per-
manently made on a full property tax 
equivalency basis; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of the State 
of New Mexico call upon all people of good 
will and local, state and national leaders to 
come together to secure the full and fair 
property tax equivalency of payments in lieu 
of taxes for children and communities 
throughout New Mexico and the Nation; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this memorial be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Vice President of the United 
States, the Majority Leader and Minority 
Leader of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker and Minority Leader of the United 
States House of Representatives, the New 
Mexico Congressional Delegation and the 
Governor of New Mexico. 
POM–30. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
President of the United States to support the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, reverse his decision to 
cancel the permit, and to support American 
jobs and energy cooperation with our Cana-
dian neighbors; to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 53 
Whereas, In order to continue fueling our 
economy, the United States will need more 
oil and natural gas. Despite efforts to in-
crease the use of renewable energy, the 
United States is still many years away from 
ending its dependence on nonrenewable re-
sources; and 
Whereas, While working towards cleaner 
energy standards and pursuing ways to use 
energy more efficiently is laudable, blindly 
rejecting the critical role of the oil and gas 
industry in fueling America’s economy will 
not only result in skyrocketing energy 
prices, but will also cripple job growth. 
Those most impacted by increased prices to 
heat their homes, fill their gas tanks, and 
keep the lights on are those least able to af-
ford it; and 
Whereas, The Premier of Alberta Province 
in Canada, upon hearing that President Joe 
Biden will revoke the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
has urged the Prime Minister of Canada to 
reach out to the Biden administration to re-
verse course. Unfortunately, instead of going 
forward with a project that will benefit 
countless communities and individuals on 
both sides of the border, President Joe Biden 
has decided to hinder American-Canadian en-
ergy cooperation as one of his first actions 
as president; and 
Whereas, The United States and Canada 
are each other’s largest energy trading part-
ners. Canada has significant oil reserves and 
is a responsible partner in regulating the oil 
and gas industry. Projects such as the Key-
stone XL Pipeline, when combined with 
other oil and gas projects in both Canada and 
the United States, promote North American 
energy independence and job creation. The 
United States should be looking for ways to 
increase and improve our relationship with 
Canada, not diminish it: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge Presi-
dent Joe Biden to support the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, reverse his decision to cancel the 
permit, and to support American jobs and 
energy cooperation with our Canadian neigh-
bors; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Office of the President of 
the United States, the President of the 
United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
the members of the Michigan congressional 
delegation. 
POM–31. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to take 
such actions as are necessary to reauthorize 
the Atchafalaya Heritage Area program; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 27 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya National Herit-
age Area program was designated in 2006 for 
the purpose of enhancing and protecting the 
historic, cultural, scenic, recreational, and 
environmental assets in the fourteen-parish 
region; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya National Herit-
age Area is one of fifty-five national heritage 
areas designated by Congress since 1984; and 
Whereas, National Heritage Areas tell sig-
nificant stories that celebrate the nation’s 
diverse heritage; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya basin is the larg-
est and most productive river swamp in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya basin provides 
habitat for twenty-four federal and state- 
listed threatened or endangered species or 
species of concern including the Louisiana 
black bear, the brown pelican, and the bald 
eagle; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya National Herit-
age Area supported events and programs 
that engaged over fifty thousand residents 
and visitors and leveraged over sixteen thou-
sand volunteer hours since 2006; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya National Herit-
age Area directly leveraged over five million 
dollars in matching funds over the life of the 
program; and 
Whereas, the Atchafalaya National Herit-
age Area is among the most culturally-rich 
and ecologically-varied regions in the United 
States, home to the widely recognized Cajun 
culture as well as a diverse population of Eu-
ropean, African, Caribbean, and Native- 
American descent. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana 
memorializes the Congress of the United 
States to take action to reauthorize the 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area program 
to continue the work of promotion and pres-
ervation of the cultural, natural, and rec-
reational resources of the area for the next 
fifteen years; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution 
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the 
United States Senate, the clerk of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
to each member of the Louisiana delegation 
to the United States Congress. 
POM–32. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Wyoming request-
ing the United States Congress and the fed-
eral government to reverse federal orders 
and actions that inhibit the safe develop-
ment of oil and gas in Wyoming; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3 
Whereas, the state of Wyoming contains 
abundant and vast natural resources that are 
and can be used for the production of energy 
throughout the United States and world; and 
Whereas, Wyoming produces energy that 
benefits consumers and industries through-
out the United States; and 
Whereas, the energy industry in Wyoming 
provides millions of dollars in taxes and 
other revenues annually to the state of Wyo-
ming; and 
Whereas, the state of Wyoming and the en-
ergy industry have worked together for 
years to develop Wyoming’s energy resources 
in a safe and environmentally responsible 
manner, including the development of tech-
nologies to promote the responsible develop-
ment and use of Wyoming energy; and 
Whereas, the federal government owns al-
most one-half (1/2) of the surface acreage 
within the state of Wyoming and more than 
forty-two million (42,000,000) acres of mineral 
estate in Wyoming; and 
Whereas, federal decisions and actions ban-
ning, pausing or significantly reducing the 
production of energy negatively impact the 
economy of Wyoming and the livelihoods and 
wellbeing of Wyoming’s residents; and 
Whereas, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. 
signed Executive Order No. 13,990 on January 
20, 2021, which requires the federal Secretary 
of the Interior to unilaterally stop all federal 
leasing of oil and gas resources in Wyoming; 
and 
Whereas, President Biden signed Executive 
Order No. 14,008 on January 27, 2021, which 
indefinitely pauses oil and natural gas leas-
ing and calls for a comprehensive review of 
federal oil and gas permitting and leasing 
practices to evaluate potential climate im-
pacts; and 
Whereas, the President and various federal 
agencies have, since January 20, 2021, taken 
actions and issued orders to limit actions, 
permits and leases for oil and gas produc-
tion, including a Department of the Interior 
order that revoked authority for issuing fos-
sil-fuel authorizations, leases, permits to 
drill and the affirmative extension of leases 
and contracts; and 
Whereas, these executive actions will lead 
companies to pursue energy development in 
other parts of the world where energy re-
sources are not as environmentally respon-
sible and where responsible energy regula-
tions are lacking to where a net negative im-
pact on climate emissions may likely result; 
and 
Whereas, these executive actions severely 
and negatively affect the value of property 
held by the state and citizens of Wyoming in 
areas affected by these orders due to the fact 
that federal property is intermingled with 
private and state lands and oil and gas devel-
opment often involves lateral drilling tech-
niques which cross several classes of prop-
erty; and 
Whereas, these executive actions will ad-
versely impact and jeopardize the employ-
ment of at least twenty thousand (20,000) 
Wyoming citizens who directly or indirectly 
work in oil, gas and related industries rep-
resenting over seven percent (7%) of the 
total employment in Wyoming; and 
Whereas, these executive actions may re-
sult in negative impacts to Wyoming’s di-
verse wildlife and habitat, including a de-
creased ability to mitigate wildlife impacts, 
increased development on currently undis-
turbed lands and a decrease in quality habi-
tat reclamation work; and 
Whereas, these executive actions are caus-
ing immediate, disproportionate and exten-
sive harm to the state of Wyoming and will 
inflict lasting damage on Wyoming resi-
dents, industries and the critical services 
upon which Wyoming residents depend. Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Members of the Legislature of 
the State of Wyoming: 
Section 1. That the President of the United 
States rescind, reverse or repeal the execu-
tive orders that were issued in January 2021 
that suspend or pause leasing, permitting, 
extensions and authorizations of oil and gas 
development in Wyoming and that will have 
an adverse impact on climate change and 
Wyoming’s wildlife and habitat resources 
while inflicting irreparable and dispropor-
tionate harm on the state of Wyoming. 
Section 2. That the President of the United 
States direct all federal agencies to rescind, 
reverse or repeal any secretarial orders or 
actions that negatively impact responsible

energy and energy technology development 
in Wyoming, including Department of the In-
terior Secretarial Order No. 3395. 
Section 3. That the Wyoming Legislature 
strongly opposes actions by or that direct 
federal agencies, including the federal Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, to unilater-
ally increase the burden on existing oil and 
gas companies in Wyoming and to increase 
the burden on those companies’ facilities in 
Wyoming in an attempt to achieve climate- 
related goals that are unrealistic and that 
disproportionately impact the people of Wy-
oming. 
Section 4. That the Wyoming Legislature 
strongly supports the efforts of the Wyoming 
congressional delegation to prevent the 
President and the federal executive branch 
from unilaterally issuing suspensions and 
moratoriums on energy development in Wyo-
ming, including the Protecting Our Wealth 
of Energy Resources (POWER) Act of 2021 
and the Safeguarding Oil and Gas Leasing 
and Permitting Act. 
Section 5. That the Wyoming Legislature 
strongly encourages further congressional 
action to protect responsible leasing and per-
mitting of oil and gas in Wyoming and to 
protect Wyoming’s residents, energy indus-
try and other industries that are negatively 
impacted by these executive actions. 
Section 6. That the Secretary of State of 
Wyoming transmit copies of this resolution 
to the President of the United States, to the 
Acting Secretary of the Department of the 
Interior, to the Acting Administrator of the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency, 
to the President of the Senate and the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives of 
the United States Congress and to the Wyo-
ming Congressional Delegation. 
POM–33. A concurrent memorial adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress to fund a 
study on floodwater harvesting; to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public Works. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2004 
Whereas, the seven Colorado Basin states, 
which consist of Arizona, California, Colo-
rado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyo-
ming, are in the twentieth year of severe 
drought and are therefore experiencing a se-
vere water shortage: and 
Whereas, water levels are critical. Lake 
Powell and Lake Mead store the water sup-
ply for both urban and rural usage, and, if 
drought 
conditions 
continue, 
these 
res-
ervoirs are likely to reach critically low ele-
vations by 2026; and 
Whereas, on January 21, 2020, the Lake 
Mead water level was at 43%, or approxi-
mately 1,093 feet; and 
Whereas, the Hoover Dam impounds Lake 
Mead and provides power to millions of peo-
ple in Southern California, Nevada and Ari-
zona. If the level of Lake Mead declines 
below 1,050 feet, hydropower generation will 
be significantly reduced; and 
Whereas, at 895 feet, Lake Mead can no 
longer provide water; and 
Whereas, a new water source could help 
augment Colorado River supplies; and 
Whereas, Denver, Colorado is successfully 
harvesting floodwater from the Missouri 
River to help alleviate its water shortage; 
and 
Whereas, in wet years, the Mississippi 
River reaches flood level with a resulting 
loss of vast quantities of water into the Gulf 
of Mexico; and 
Whereas, historic flooding in 2011 and 2019 
along the Mississippi River caused 11 deaths 
and damaged infrastructure, homes, busi-
nesses and agriculture and other industries. 
Combined estimates of damages and losses of 
the flooding exceeded $9.5 bi11ion, according 
to the United States National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration; and 
Whereas, liquid can be successfully moved 
thousands of miles through pipelines; and 
Whereas, Arizona has long been at the fore-
front among western states in supporting the 
development and implementation of pio-
neering, well-reasoned water management 
policies. 
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of 
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the 
Senate concurring, prays: 
1. That the United States Congress fund a 
technological and feasibility study of devel-
oping a diversion dam and pipeline to har-
vest floodwater from the Mississippi River to 
replenish the Colorado River and prevent 
flood damage along the Mississippi River. 
2. That, if shown to be feasible, the United 
States Congress implement the diversion 
dam and pipeline as a partial solution to the 
water supply shortage in Lake Powell and 
Lake Mead and the flood damage that occurs 
along the Mississippi River. 
3. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives, the Governors of the Mis-
sissippi River states of Arkansas, Illinois, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mis-
sissippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin, 
and each Member of Congress from the State 
of Arizona. 
POM–34. A concurrent memorial adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress to appro-
priate monies to eradicate salt cedars from 
Arizona waterways; to the Committee on En-
vironment and Public Works. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2001 
Whereas, the salt cedar tree, also known as 
the tamarisk, was brought to the United 
States in the 1800s as an ornamental plant to 
stabilize soil and control erosion; and 
Whereas, salt cedars are now listed as an 
invasive species by the United States De-
partment of Agriculture; and 
Whereas, salt cedars spread prolifically by 
both seed and sprouting, congesting thou-
sands of acres of river land in Arizona; and 
Whereas, the density of salt cedars creates 
dangerous conditions by congesting flood- 
prone areas, impeding water flow and exacer-
bating the impact of flooding; and 
Whereas, by increasing the frequency and 
intensity of wildfires, salt cedars threaten 
existing and future infrastructure in sur-
rounding communities; and 
Whereas, this invasive plant out-competes 
native cottonwood. mesquite and willow and 
displaces riparian and other wildlife habitats 
by altering the ecology and hydrology of na-
tive systems; and 
Whereas, each salt cedar tree consumes 200 
to 300 gallons of water a day, which lowers 
the water table and creates large deposits of 
salt in the soil; and 
Whereas, salt cedars negatively impact Ar-
izona’s economy by jeopardizing agriculture 
due to high water usage, tending to obstruct 
irrigation canals and limiting recreational 
opportunities; and 
Whereas, eliminating salt cedars will sus-
tain precious water supplies, reduce the risk 
of environmental disasters. and minimize 
structural and ecological damage and loss of 
life. 
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of 
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the 
Senate concurring, prays: 
1. That the United States Congress appro-
priate monies to the State of Arizona to 
eradicate salt cedars from Arizona water-
ways. 
2. That the United States Department of 
the Interior and the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture develop innovative solu-
tions to control the proliferation of salt ce-
dars.

of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States, the 
President of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the Secretary of the United 
States Department of the Interior, the Sec-
retary of the United States Department of

HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 73 
Whereas, Louisiana has a long and distin-
guished history of consistent, reliable win-
tering waterfowl habitat for generations: and 
Whereas, waterfowl biologists estimate 
seed production in moist-soil wetlands lo-
cated along migration routes and at win-

Whereas, the Natural Resources Conserva-
tion Service of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture (NRCS) has a long 
record of working with private landowners to 
implement conservation practices and pro-
grams for the benefit of Louisiana’s farms, 
wetlands, and wildlife habitats; and 
Whereas, the Louisiana Waterfowl Working 
Group (LWWG) is comprised of a diverse

mon interest and concern over the direction 
Louisiana’s waterfowl stock is heading; and 
Whereas, the LWWG’s mission is to ensure 
that waterfowl habitat remains a focal point 
for policy makers and stakeholders at all 
levels: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the Louisiana 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the 
National Resources Conservation Service, 
and the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service to collaborate and contribute their 
knowledge and expertise with the Louisiana 
Waterfowl Working Group in an effort to im-

Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the secretary of the Lou-
isiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, 
the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
of the United States Department of Agri-

POM–36. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of New Jersey urg-
ing the President of the United States and 
the Environmental Protection Agency to 
take appropriate action to issue waivers and 
implement other reforms to allow for the 
blending of renewable fuels under the federal 
‘‘Clean Air Act’’; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works. 
ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 238 
Whereas, Over the past year, United States 
refiners have been devastated by spiking, 
volatile Renewable Identification Number 
(RIN) prices under the federal Renewable 
Fuel Standard (RFS) program and a dra-
matic reduction in the use of fuel that was 
triggered by the COVID–19 pandemic. These 
factors have resulted in a shortage of RINs, 
and eight refinery closures, throughout the 
nation; and 
Whereas, 
The 
United 
States 
Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) has author-
ity from Congress to waive the RFS pro-
gram’s renewable fuel requirements ‘‘in 
whole or in part’’ if the EPA Administrator 
determines that ‘‘implementation of the re-
quirement would severely harm the econ-
omy’’ of a State, region, or the United 
States; and 
Whereas, Many independent refiners al-
ready struggle with slim margins and the 
RFS program’s RIN requirements, as well as 
the manner in which the unregulated RIN 
market operates without oversight and sub-
ject to speculation and fraud, all of which 
are currently inflicting serious economic 
harm on those businesses; and 
Whereas, Current RFS compliance ex-
penses exceed refineries’ combined annual 
costs for labor, utilities, and maintenance, 
making the costs of such compliance refin-
eries’ largest expense, other than the pur-
chase of crude oil; and 
Whereas, RIN prices have dramatically in-
creased as a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, increasing from as low as 10 cents at 
the beginning of 2020 to nearly $2.00 in June 
2021, and leading to a consequent increase, of 
approximately 30 cents per gallon, in the 
cost of making gasoline; 
Whereas, Harmful financial effects associ-
ated with the complex RFS program are es-
pecially severe under current market condi-
tions, where demand for refined products is 
significantly depressed by the COVID–19 pan-
demic and is not expected to fully recover in 
the near future; and 
Whereas, The COVID–19 pandemic caused 
an unprecedented year-over-year decline in 
demand for petroleum and other liquid fuels, 
leading to temporary, partial, and perma-
nent 
refinery 
closures, 
including 
the 
mothballing of the fuels section of the 
Paulsboro Refinery in New Jersey, as well as 
other capacity reductions throughout the 
United States; and 
Whereas, Production data published by the 
Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 
the United States Department of Energy 
(DOE) has repeatedly shown, for several 
years, that there is no relationship between 
RIN prices and the amount of ethanol that’s 
actually blended into the nation’s gasoline 
supply; and 
Whereas, The EIA recently noted that, in 
2020, 800 million fewer RINs were actually 
generated than what was required to meet 
the 2020 RFS standard, thereby resulting in a 
shortage of available RINs, especially when 
combined with hoarding by unregulated, 
non-industry speculators; and 
Whereas, Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
State and regional refineries supported over 
16,500 New Jersey jobs, compensating those 
employees with more than a billion dollars 
in total, while adding $4.2 billion to the 
State’s gross domestic product and gener-
ating over $12.3 billion in total economic 
output, including the payment of more than 
$382 million in State and local taxes. Unfor-
tunately, some of the jobs supported by 
these refineries were lost due to a partial 
shutdown attributable to the COVID–19 pan-
demic; and 
Whereas, Refining and petrochemical in-
dustries contribute approximately $600 bil-
lion annually to the nation’s economy and 
employ over three million industrial workers 
in 33 states, but increasing dependence on 
imported fuels threatens these industries 
and potentially affects their fuel supplies; 
and 
Whereas, The recent hacking incident af-
fecting the Colonial Pipeline has exposed the 
vulnerability of the nation’s energy supply, 
highlighting the need to keep our refineries 
open to fuel the economy; and 
Whereas, On June 1, 2021, Governor Phil 
Murphy wrote to the EPA to urge the agency 
to extend flexibilities to merchant refiners 
through the renewable volume obligation 
under the RFS program; now, therefore, and 
be it 
Resolved, By the Senate and General As-
sembly of the State of New Jersey: 
1. The Legislature of the State of New Jer-
sey respectfully urges the United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency to exercise 
its waiver authority, pursuant to section 
211(o)(7)(A)(i) of the ‘‘Clean Air Act,’’ 42 
U.S.C. s.7545(o)(7)(A)(i), to reduce nationwide 
Renewable Fuel Standard volume mandates 
in order to provide relief to refiners in New 
Jersey, on the East Coast, and elsewhere. 
2. The Legislature also respectfully urges 
the President of the United States and the 
United States Environmental Protection 
Agency to establish reasonable 2021 and 2022 
Renewable Fuel Standard volume mandates, 
which are in line with actual gasoline and 
diesel demand, and to make the reforming 
and restructuring of the Renewable Fuel 
Standard program a national priority, so as 
to maintain low and stable Renewable Iden-
tification Number prices while allowing for 
the continued blending of renewable fuels 
consistent with the original intent of the 
program.

issue has only become more pressing as 
climate change increases the risk of 
drought in the West. Right now, 87 per-
cent of California is facing ‘‘Extreme 
Drought’’ conditions and 33 percent of 
the state is experiencing ‘‘Exceptional 
Drought’’ conditions, the most severe 
category. 
A growing number of States, includ-
ing California, have begun offering re-
bates to homeowners to improve the 
water efficiency of their homes. Unfor-
tunately, many homeowners are un-
aware that they are required to pay 
federal income taxes on these rebates 
and are surprised to be stuck with that 
bill. Still other homeowners aware of 
the 
tax 
implications 
are 
disincentivized from making these effi-
ciencies to their homes. 
The ‘‘Water Conservation Rebate Tax 
Parity Act’’ would exempt such State 
and local rebates for water conserva-
tion improvements, as well as improve-
ments to better handle storm water 
runoff, from taxable income. This 
would eliminate the unexpected bill 
homeowners face, increasing the incen-
tive to make these improvements, 
which benefit all of us. 
I note that such State rebates for en-
ergy conservation improvements are 
already excluded from taxable income. 
Thus, my bill would simply put water 
conservation rebates on par with en-
ergy conservation rebates for tax treat-
ment. 
It is critical that Congress explore 
many ways to address climate change 
and mitigate the impacts that we are 
already 
seeing. 
Encouraging 
home-
owners to make their properties more 
water-efficient is one way to do that. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. BURR, Mr. PADILLA, and Mr. 
TILLIS): 
S. 2432. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from 
gross income amounts received from 
State-based catastrophe loss mitiga-
tion programs; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘Dis-
aster Mitigation and Tax Parity Act,’’ 
which Senator BURR and I introduced 
today. Representative MIKE THOMPSON 
(D–CA) has introduced companion leg-
islation in the House of Representa-
tives. 
Encouraging homeowners to take 
steps to reduce the risk of natural ca-
tastrophe damage to their homes has 
long been a goal of policy makers. In 
California, it has been a special chal-
lenge to incentivize individuals to pur-
chase earthquake insurance and to 
harden their homes against potential 
earthquake damage. 
The threat of natural disasters and 
extreme weather events has become a 
much greater problem in recent years 
due to climate change, which is driving 
an increasing frequency and severity of 
wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and 
other catastrophic events. This, in 
turn, is reducing the availability and 
increasing the costs of insurance for in-
dividuals and businesses. 
A growing number of states, includ-
ing California, have begun offering re-
bates to homeowners to improve their 
homes to mitigate against damage 
from such events. Unfortunately, many 
homeowners are unaware that they are 
required to pay Federal income taxes 
on these rebates and are surprised to be 
stuck with that bill. Other homeowners 
who are aware of the tax implications 
are disincentivized from making these 
improvements to their homes. 
The ‘‘Disaster Mitigation and Tax 
Parity Act’’ would exempt such State 
rebates for disaster mitigation im-
provements from taxable income. This 
would eliminate the unexpected bill 
homeowners face, increasing the incen-
tive to make these improvements, 
which benefit all of us. 
I also note that such State rebates 
for energy conservation improvements 
are already excluded from taxable in-
come. Thus, our bill would simply put 
disaster mitigation rebates on par with 
energy conservation measures. 
I am pleased that Congress is explor-
ing many ways to address climate 
change-related matters. Encouraging 
homeowners to make their properties 
more resistant to natural catastrophe 
damage is one way to help. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor.

By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
BENNET, Mr. CASEY, Mr. DUR-
BIN, 
Ms.

Mr. 
MENENDEZ, and Mrs. MURRAY): 
S. 2452. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide match-
ing payments for retirement savings 
contributions by certain individuals, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
have 
introduced 
the 
Encouraging 
Americans to Save Act (EASA). This 
legislation makes common sense re-
forms to the saver’s tax credit by mak-
ing the credit refundable and restruc-
turing it as a government matching 
contribution that is directly deposited 
into a taxpayer’s retirement savings 
account. This bill would offer matching 
contributions for the first time to mil-
lions of middle and low income individ-
uals not covered by an employer-spon-
sored retirement plan, including those 
who save through an IRA under a state 
or local government savings program— 
such as workers in my home State of 
Oregon under the OregonSaves pro-
gram. The government match is also 
available to middle and lower income 
savers who participate in an employer- 
sponsored plan. The government match 
provided by the bill would both encour-
age saving and help middle and low in-
come earners build assets by providing 
an immediate, meaningful return on 
their personal contributions. The legis-
lation 
would 
also 
establish 
a 
coronavirus bonus recovery credit that 
would provide an additional govern-
ment match of up to $5,000 to workers 
on their retirement saving for a five 
year period. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
and 
Mr. 
OSSOFF): 
S. 2454. A bill to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reau-
thorize the pilot program for alter-
native water source projects, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Water Reuse and Re-
siliency Act.’’ This legislation would 
authorize $1 billion for innovative 
water infrastructure projects that re-
spond to our Country’s growing water 
needs and the historic drought facing 
the Western United States. 
In the face of unprecedented heat and 
drought conditions across the Western 
United States, and growing water re-
source challenges across the entire Na-
tion, it is critically important that we 
invest now to modernize and adapt our 
water systems for the 21st century. 
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s Alternative Water Source Projects 
pilot program provides competitive 
grants to engineer, design, construct, 
and test alternative water source sys-
tems, including water recycling sys-
tems and projects that conserve, man-
age, reclaim, or reuse water resources. 
The Water Reuse and Resiliency Act 
would reauthorize the EPA’s Alter-
native Water Source Projects pilot pro-
gram for five years, increase the au-
thorization to $1 billion, and make 
stormwater reuse and groundwater re-
charge projects eligible for grant fund-
ing. 
According to the National Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration 
(NOAA), as of July 13, an estimated 
89% of the Western U.S. is experiencing 
drought. 
Unfortunately, 
historic 
droughts are becoming the new normal. 
The impacts of drought on water avail-
ability are compounded by triple-digit 
temperatures, record low snowpack 
levels, and a growing population. 
By expanding the use of alternative, 
non-traditional water sources, such as 
capturing stormwater runoff and recy-
cling wastewater for groundwater re-
charge, the Water Reuse and Resiliency 
Act supports innovations in water 
treatment that can deliver a new, safe, 
and reliable source of water for potable 
use or irrigation. 
I thank my co-lead, Senator FEIN-
STEIN, for her tireless leadership fight-
ing for clean water for Californians and

Mr. ROMNEY (for himself, Mr. BEN-
NET, Mr. HAGERTY, Mr. COONS, and Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 314 
Whereas, for 125 years, the Olympic Move-
ment has worked to build a better and more 
peaceful world by educating young people 
through amateur athletics, bringing to-
gether athletes from many countries in 
friendly competition, and forging new rela-
tionships bound by friendship, solidarity, 
and fair play; 
Whereas the 2020 Olympic Games will take 
place in Tokyo, Japan, from July 23, 2021, to 
August 8, 2021, and the 2020 Paralympic 
Games will take place in Tokyo, Japan, from 
August 24, 2021, to September 5, 2021; 
Whereas, at the 2020 Olympic Games, 206 
countries will compete in more than 330 
events in nearly 40 disciplines, and at the 
2020 Paralympic Games, more than 165 coun-
tries will compete in events in 22 disciplines; 
Whereas the United States Olympic and 
Paralympic Teams have won 1,974 gold med-
als, 1,685 silver medals, and 1,536 bronze med-
als, totaling 5,195 medals, during the past 
Olympic and Paralympic Games; 
Whereas the United States plans to send 
613 athletes to participate in the 2020 Olym-
pic and Paralympic Games, including a 
record 329 women; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
stand united in respect for and admiration of 
the members of the United States Olympic 
and Paralympic Teams and the athletic ac-
complishments, sportsmanship, and dedica-
tion to excellence of the United States 
Olympic and Paralympic Teams; 
Whereas the many accomplishments of the 
United 
States 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic 
Teams would not have been possible without 
the hard work and dedication of many oth-
ers, including individuals on the United 
States Olympic and Paralympic Committee 
and the National Governing Bodies of Sport 
and the many administrators, coaches, and 
family members who provided critical sup-
port to the athletes; 
Whereas the United States Government is 
grateful to Japan for hosting the 2020 Olym-
pic and Paralympic Games; 
Whereas Japan successfully hosted the 1964 
Tokyo Olympics, the first ever Olympic 
Games to be held in Asia, as a symbol of Jap-
anese postwar reconstruction and a catalyst 
for economic growth and technological de-
velopment; 
Whereas Japan successfully hosted the 1972 
Winter Olympics in Sapporo and the 1998 
Winter Olympics in Nagano; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
take great pride in the qualities of commit-
ment to excellence, grace under pressure, 
and goodwill toward competitors exhibited 
by the athletes of the United States Olympic 
and Paralympic Teams; and 
Whereas the Olympic Movement celebrates 
competition, fair play, and the pursuit of 
glory, elevating the eternal qualities of the 
human spirit to the world stage: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports proceeding with the 2020 Olym-
pic and Paralympic Games in a safe and se-
cure environment; 
(2) commends the Government of Japan 
and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in 
their efforts to commit tremendous re-
sources to provide a safe and secure environ-
ment for the athletes competing in the 2020

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. RES. 315 
Whereas the first Hamilton-class cutter 
was the United States Coast Guard Cutter 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘USCGC’’) 
Hamilton, which was placed in full commis-
sion on March 18, 1967; 
Whereas USCGC Mellon, USCGC Chase, 
USCGC Dallas, USCGC Boutwell, USCGC 
Sherman, USCGC Gallatin, USCGC Morgen-
thau, USCGC Rush, USCGC Munro, USCGC 
Midgett, and USCGC Jarvis completed the 
class of high endurance cutters and were 1 of 
the most highly versatile and capable vessels 
at 
the 
time 
of 
their 
construction 
at 
Avondale Shipyards in Louisiana; 
Whereas 
Hamilton-class 
cutters 
coura-
geously supported multiple peacetime and 
wartime operations during their time in ac-
tive service, including Operation Market 
Time, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation 
Vigilant Sentinel, Operation Deny Flight, 
and Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
Whereas Hamilton-class cutters conducted 
illegal 
narcotics 
interdictions 
totaling 
3,300,000 pounds and $23,600,000,000 in market 
value, including the interdiction conducted 
by USCGC Hamilton and USCGC Sherman of 
the M/V Gatun, which discovered 20 metric 
tons of illegal narcotics with an estimated 
street value of $600,000,000 for the largest 
narcotics interdiction in United States his-
tory at the time; 
Whereas Hamilton-class cutters have saved 
thousands of lives during search and rescue 
operations at sea, including the rescue con-
ducted by USCGC Boutwell and USCGC Mel-
lon of all 520 passengers and crew of the M/ 
S Prinsendam, 1 of the largest at-sea rescues 
in Coast Guard history; 
Whereas Hamilton-class cutters received 
excellent shoreside support at Coast Guard 
homeports in Alaska, California, Hawaii, 
Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, 
and Washington, allowing the cutters to per-
form admirably past their service life; 
Whereas the Mississippi-built National Se-
curity Cutter replaced the Hamilton-class 
cutter to continue the storied success of high 
endurance Coast Guard cutters at sea; 
Whereas USCGC Douglas Munro, formerly 
known as USCGC Munro, decommissioned on 
April 24, 2021, ending over 54 years of service 
of Hamilton-class cutters to the United 
States; 
Whereas Coast Guard cutters remain a 
vital component of United States capability 
across the globe in serving to protect life at 
sea, deterring illicit activity, and ensuring 
the continuance of the international rules- 
based order at all levels of the competition 
continuum; 
Whereas the increasing global complexity 
and expanding demand for Coast Guard serv-
ices necessitates the best people, modern 
technology, 
resilient 
infrastructure, 
and 
highly capable assets; and 
Whereas Congress must recognize the im-
portance of maximizing afloat readiness for 
the Coast Guard by supporting personnel, in-
vesting in mission-enabling technologies, 
and modernizing assets: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the success of the Hamilton- 
class cutters in service to the United States; 
(2) commends the officers and crew of 
Hamilton-class cutters for their technical 
excellence, 
accomplishments, 
profes-
sionalism, and sacrifices; 
(3) supports the role of Coast Guard cutters 
and their importance to national security, 
law enforcement at sea, and homeland de-
fense; and 
(4) applauds the Coast Guard for con-
tinuing to advance the capabilities of the 
fleet with the National Security Cutter to 
adapt to the growing need for a global Coast 
Guard presence.

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and the distinguished 
Republican leader, Mr. MCCONNELL, I 
send to the desk a resolution author-
izing representation by the Senate 
Legal Counsel and ask for its imme-
diate consideration. 
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns third-party subpoenas to a Sen-
ate employee from Alfa Bank, the 
plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in Flor-
ida State court. The plaintiff, a large 
Russian bank, alleges in its lawsuit 
that unnamed defendants used cyber 
tools to create internet log data ap-
pearing to show communications be-
tween computer servers of the plaintiff 
and the Trump Organization, causing 
negative publicity. Alfa Bank is con-
ducting third-party discovery to iden-
tify the unnamed persons it alleges 
conspired against it. As part of that at-
tempted discovery, it has issued two 
subpoenas to a staff member of the 
Committee on Armed Services seeking 
testimony and Committee documents 
regarding his work for the Committee 
in examining the publicly-reported al-
legations about possible clandestine 
internet 
communications 
between 
plaintiff and the Trump Organization. 
Because the subpoenas seek testi-
mony and documents relating to infor-
mation gathering activities the staff 
person undertook as part of his duties 
for the Committee, they request infor-
mation that is absolutely privileged 
under the Speech or Debate Clause. In 
addition, 
sovereign 
immunity 
pre-
cludes enforcement of State court sub-
poenas against officials and employees 
of the Federal government. This reso-
lution would authorize the Senate 
Legal Counsel to represent the Com-
mittee on Armed Services and its staff 
member and move to quash the sub-
poenas, at the request of the Com-
mittee. 
In addition, to demonstrate to the 
court the applicability of the Speech or 
Debate Clause privilege in this matter, 
the resolution authorizes the Majority 
Staff Director of the Committee to pro-
vide a limited declaration in support of 
the motion to quash. By submitting 
this limited declaration solely to es-
tablish its privilege, the Committee is 
not waiving, and, indeed, continues to 
assert, its absolute Speech or Debate 
Clause privilege against being com-
pelled to produce any information in 
this matter. 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
317—CON-
GRATULATING THE MILWAUKEE 
BUCKS, AND THE FANS OF THE 
MILWAUKEE 
BUCKS 
AROUND 
THE WORLD, ON WINNING THE

SOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP 
Ms. BALDWIN (for herself and Mr. 
JOHNSON) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 317 
Whereas, on Tuesday, July 20, 2021, the 
Milwaukee Bucks (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘Bucks’’) won the 2021 National 
Basketball Association (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘NBA’’) championship by 
defeating the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 of the 
NBA Finals by a score of 105 to 98, winning 
the series 4 games to 2; 
Whereas the Bucks won— 
(1) the second NBA championship in the 
history of the franchise; 
(2) their first round of the NBA playoffs by 
defeating the Miami Heat 4 games to 0; 
(3) their Eastern Conference semi-finals 
match-up against the Brooklyn Nets 4 games 
to 3; and 
(4) the Eastern Conference Finals by de-
feating the Atlanta Hawks 4 games to 2; 
Whereas every member of the 2020–2021 
Bucks played a key role in the quest for a 
championship, including— 
(1) Giannis Antetokounmpo; 
(2) Thanasis Antetokounmpo; 
(3) Elijah Bryant;

Whereas the entire Bucks organization de-
serves 
congratulations 
for 
this 
historic 
achievement, including— 
(1) the owners of the Bucks, Marc Lasry, 
Wes Edens, Jamie Dinan, and Michael 
Fascitelli; 
(2) the General Manager of the Bucks, Jon 
Horst; and 
(3) the head coach of the Bucks, Mike 
Budenholzer; 
Whereas Giannis Antetokounmpo, for the 
first time, was named the Most Valuable 
Player of the NBA Finals, in which he— 
(1) averaged 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5 as-
sists, and 1.8 blocks per game; and

(1) scored 50 points, shooting 64 percent 
from the field and making 17 of 19 free 
throws; 
(2) had 14 rebounds; and 
(3) blocked 5 shots; 
Whereas Bucks forward Khris Middleton, 
the first NBA player to begin his career in 
the Development League and subsequently 
become an NBA All-Star, which Middleton 
became in the 2018–2019 season, had an 
impactful performance throughout the NBA 
Finals, including a crucial mid-range shot 
with 1 minute remaining in Game 6; 
Whereas the Bucks won their first NBA 
championship in 50 years, when NBA legends 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson 
brought a title to Milwaukee in 1971; 
Whereas the Bucks, who won the 2021 NBA 
championship in 6 games, fulfilled the proph-
ecy of Bucks legend Brandon Jennings, who, 
in 2013, began the ‘‘Bucks in 6’’ rallying cry; 
and 
Whereas the fans in the Deer District 
showed up, game after game, to cheer on the 
Bucks in large numbers outside Fiserv 
Forum: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Milwaukee Bucks (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘Bucks’’), 
and the loyal fans of the Bucks, on winning 
the 2021 National Basketball Association 
championship;

S. RES. 165 
øWhereas 
United 
States 
citizen 
Paul 
Whelan is a resident of Novi, Michigan, and 
a United States Marine Corps veteran; 
øWhereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow 
for the wedding of a personal friend on De-
cember 22, 2018; 
øWhereas Russia’s Federal Security Serv-
ice arrested Paul Whelan at the Metropol 
Hotel in Moscow on December 28, 2018, and 
charged him with espionage;

never provided any evidence of supposed 
wrongdoing; 
øWhereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in 
Lefortovo Prison and was held there for 
more than 19 months after his arrest in pre- 
trial detention; 
øWhereas the Federal Security Service has 
not provided any evidence of supposed 
wrongdoing; 
øWhereas a Moscow court extended Paul 
Whelan’s pre-trial detention multiple times 
without publicly presenting justification or 
evidence of wrongdoing;

curity Service-appointed lawyer, Vladimir 
Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019, ‘‘[The 
Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out 
what they have, but in this case, we’ve seen 
nothing concrete against Whelan in five 
months. That means there is nothing.’’; 
øWhereas the then United States Ambas-
sador to the Russian Federation, Jon Hunts-
man, responded on April 12, 2019, to a ques-
tion about the detention of Paul Whelan, ‘‘If 
the Russians have evidence, they should 
bring it forward. We have seen nothing. If 
there was a case, I think the evidence would

him to ensure United States citizens are not 
unjustly held abroad;

Whelan full access to his lawyer and the so- 
called evidence against him, and any evi-
dence he has seen is in Russian, a language 
Paul does not read or speak;

cility and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-
fused to provide medical treatment for Paul 
Whelan’s medical condition, despite being 
aware of its worsening state, resulting in

øWhereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully con-
victed on June 15, 2020, and sentenced to 16 
years in a Russian labor camp by a three- 
judge panel, in a trial witnessed by United 
States Ambassador John Sullivan, who re-
ferred to it as ‘‘a mockery of justice’’ due to 
the denial of a fair trial and the exclusion of 
defense witnesses; 
øWhereas, in August 2020, on an unknown 
day because he was moved secretly, Paul 
Whelan was transferred to camp IK–17, a 
penal labor camp in Mordovia, where he is 
forced to work 6 days a week in a garment 
factory; 
øWhereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while 
visiting Paul Whelan at the labor camp in

his guilt,’’ and reiterated his call that the 
Russian authorities correct this injustice 
and release Mr. Whelan; and 
øWhereas 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony 
Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Min-
ister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021, and 
urged him to release Americans detained in 
Russia, including Paul Whelan and Trevor 
Reed, so that they are able to return home to 
their families in the United States: Now,

sure United States citizens are not unjustly held

HONORING MELISSA FULTON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Melissa Fulton 
to recognize her substantial contributions to 
our community through her remarkable career 
in the Lakeport Chamber of Commerce and 
her extensive service to Lake County. 
Melissa was born and raised in Harvey, Illi-
nois, but moved to Lakeport California with her 
husband John in 1989. That same year she 
joined the Lakeport Chamber of Commerce 
where she became an active volunteer. After 
a search committee recognized her impec-
cable leadership and ability, she was recruited 
to fulfill the positions of Executive Director and 
Chief Executive Officer for the Lakeport 
Chamber of Commerce. She has been serving 
in these positions for 27 years with only a brief 
break to serve as Advertising Director of the 
Lake County Record-Bee and the Clear Lake 
Observer-American newspapers. 
Melissa holds a passion for selfless service 
as demonstrated through her leadership in her 
career and in multiple community groups. This 
includes serving on the Board of Directors of 
the Lake County Economic Development Cor-
poration, the Lake County Rodeo Association, 
and the Lakeport Main Street Association. Ad-
ditionally, Melissa was a past President of the 
Lakeport Rotary club, where she facilitated 
fundraising efforts to support the painting and 
restoration of the Library Park Gazebo. 
Her invaluable contributions and achieve-
ments to the community include transforming 
the Lakeport Chamber of Commerce to the 
Lake County Chamber of Commerce, creating 
the annual Destination publication, designing 
and constructing the annual Lake County ex-
hibits for the California State fair, and estab-
lishing the certified tourism Ambassador pro-
gram in Lake County. Melissa has been de-
scribed by colleagues and community mem-
bers as a mentor, an instigator, and above all 
a Lake County treasure who will leave a leg-
acy for herself as a passionate and deter-
mined advocate for Lake County. 
Madam Speaker, Melissa Fulton’s achieve-
ments will leave a tremendous impact in Lake 
County for generations to come. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today.

IN HONOR OF PRETRIAL, PROBA-
TION AND PAROLE WEEK 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the Nation’s community su-
pervision professionals and the many vital 
roles they play in their work with justice-in-
volved adults and juveniles. They identify op-
portunities and services to help individuals 
successfully contribute to society, while, at the 
same time, holding them accountable for their 
actions. They remain always mindful of their 
role in ensuring public safety. 
In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole 
Supervision Week 2021, we salute all of those 
who have chosen this important career. In the 
District of Columbia, we especially thank the 
Court Services and Offender Supervision 
Agency for the District of Columbia and the 
Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Co-
lumbia for their service. These agencies are 
models of excellence in community super-
vision. Their work reflects the theme of Pre-
trial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week, 
‘‘Restoring Trust, Creating Hope.’’ 
As was the case last year, community su-
pervision officers have demonstrated great 
courage and resolve in continuing their work 
during the coronavirus pandemic. They have 
found innovative ways to remain connected 
with the individuals they supervise and to con-
tinue guiding them in the interest of safety. 
Community supervision agencies are valu-
able partners of government agencies, non-
profits, neighborhood-based groups and all 
who strive to make our nation safer and 
stronger. We extend our gratitude to them and 
ask the House of Representatives to honor 
them and recognize their many achievements 
as we proclaim July 18–24, 2021, as Pretrial, 
Probation and Parole Supervision Week in 
Washington, D.C.

HONORING 
ARMENIAN 
AMBAS-
SADOR VARUZHAN NERSESYAN 
FOR HIS WORK STRENGTHENING 
THE 
U.S.-ARMENIA 
RELATION-
SHIP 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor His Excellency Varuzhan Nersesyan, 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary 
of the Republic of Armenia to the United 
States. After nearly three years of dedicated 
service, Ambassador Nersesyan and his fam-
ily will soon embark across the Atlantic to 
serve as Armenia’s Ambassador to the United 
Kingdom. 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus 
on Armenian Issues, I would like to thank the 
Ambassador for his partnership and willing-
ness to work together to strengthen the U.S.- 
Armenia relationship and share issues of im-
portance relating to Armenia and the greater 
South Caucasus region. 
Over the past three decades, Armenia has 
faced three wars initiated by its neighbor, 
Azerbaijan, dual blockades by Turkey and 
Azerbaijan, the lingering impact of the dev-
astating 1988 earthquake, energy shortages, 
an influx of Armenian refugees forcibly dis-
placed from Azerbaijan, and periods of mass 
migration. Armenia has endured these chal-
lenges through the will of its people, who have 
strongly committed to democracy and the rule 
of law in contrast to many countries in the re-
gion. As a result, Armenia’s last two par-
liamentary elections were free, fair, trans-
parent, and accessible—a true testament to 
Armenia’s democratic principles. 
The Ambassador has been a strong pro-
ponent of this democratic push, helping to en-
hance vibrant and strong U.S.-Armenia rela-
tions by helping to bring the legislative 
branches of our countries closer together. My 
colleagues in Congress and I have warmly 
welcomed our parliamentarian counterparts 
from Armenia in the U.S. Capitol. U.S. Con-
gressional delegations have also been wel-
comed in Armenia, including a visit to Armenia 
involving Members of the House Democracy 
Partnership in 2019. We must continue this 
work of advancing our countries’ mutual inter-
ests. The United States must continue reward-
ing innovative democracies and inclusive 
economies like Armenia. This is especially 
true in a region that is dominated by authori-
tarian regimes which have a tendency of per-
petuating aggressions and attempting to stoke 
instability. 
Ambassador Nersesyan also exemplified the 
great personal strength and resolve shown of 
all Armenians as the world witnessed the 
heartbreaking 44-day war in Artsakh per-
petrated by Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Turkish- 
backed mercenaries in the fall of 2020. Arme-
nians in Artsakh have shown the international 
community that their right to self-determination 
in their centuries-old homeland must be taken 
seriously and their voices have been amplified 
by exemplary Armenian diplomats like the Am-
bassador. I witnessed his tireless dedication to 
advocating on their behalf for their right to 
self-determination and know his many efforts 
have not gone unheard in the United States 
Congress or in the current Administration. 
Ambassador Nersesyan’s mission in Wash-
ington, D.C. is not his first experience in the 
United States. His deep knowledge of our 
country and commitment to diplomacy was 
evident when he served as Armenia’s Deputy 
Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Armenia 
from 2008 and 2012. During that time, he also 
matriculated and graduated from my alma 
mater—the Fletcher School of Law and Diplo-
macy at Tufts University—where he earned a 
Global Master of Arts.

July 22, 2021 
During his time here, the Ambassador and 
his team have also done a wonderful job at 
showcasing Armenia’s vibrant culture and his-
tory through many educational and artistic 
events in our nation’s capital such as An Ar-
menian Odyssey in early March 2020. 
Once again, I take this opportunity to salute 
Ambassador Nersesyan on his mission here in 
the United States. He has truly served in the 
United States with distinction and humility and 
has succeeded in strengthening U.S.-Armenia 
relations. I would like to bid him and his family 
farewell with the hope that he will continue to 
shine a bright light on behalf of his country in 
future diplomatic assignments.

PFAS ACTION ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2467, the ‘‘PFAS Ac-
tion Act of 2021’’, which is comprehensive leg-
islation to regulate Per- and poly- fluoroalkyl 
substances (‘‘PFAS’’) chemicals, clean up 
contamination, and protect public health. 
H.R. 2467 will provide the protections im-
pacted communities need quickly and for the 
long term. 
Specifically, this bill will require Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) to use tools 
under several environmental statutes to: 
Stem the flow of PFAS contamination into 
the environment by requiring cleanup of con-
tamination sites, setting air emission limits, 
prohibiting unsafe incineration of PFAS, and 
limiting the introduction of new PFAS chemi-
cals into commerce; 
Identify health risks by requiring comprehen-
sive health testing for all PFAS, reporting of 
PFAS releases, and monitoring for PFAS in 
drinking water; 
Inform communities of PFAS risks by requir-
ing the EPA Administrator to develop a risk- 
communication 
strategy 
and 
establish 
a 
website with information on testing of house-
hold well water; and 
Limit human exposure to PFAS by requiring 
a drinking water standard for PFAS that pro-
tects public health, including the health of vul-
nerable subpopulations like pregnant women, 
infants, and children, and holding polluters ac-
countable. 
The legislation also provides grants to im-
pacted water systems, creates a voluntary 
label for cookware that is PFAS free, provides 
guidance for first responders to limit their ex-
posures, and requires effluent limitations and 
pretreatment standards for PFAS introduction 
or discharge. 
Known as PFAS, for per- and polytluoroalkyl 
substances, the chemicals in this class of ap-
proximately 5,000 substances have become 
notorious as much for their potential danger as 
for their perseverance. 
Because the chemical bonds that hold the 
compounds together don’t break down easily, 
they last a very long time—a reality that has 
led to a commonly used name for the group: 
‘‘Forever chemicals.’’ 
PFAS compounds are also ubiquitous and 
used in a range of products from food-delivery 
boxes to nonstick cookware to stain-resistant 
clothing. 
But one of the most troubling routes to 
PFAS exposure is drinking water that has 
been contaminated by discharges from fac-
tories and other facilities. 
PFAS chemicals are an urgent public health 
threat, because they are persistent, bio-
accumulative, and toxic. 
PFAS have long been linked with adverse 
health effects including cancer, immune sys-
tem effects, infertility, impaired child develop-
ment, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease. 
PFAS have been detected in the drinking 
water of more than 1,400 communities in 49 
states, according to research by the PFAS 
Project at Northeastern University in Boston 
and the Environmental Working Group (EWG). 
According to monitoring by the EPA, millions 
of Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of 
PFAS through their drinking water. 
Military families and communities are at es-
pecially high risk. 
A 2018 UCS analysis of 131 U.S. military 
facilities showed that nearly all had significant 
PFAS contamination of groundwater or drink-
ing water, some with levels over 100,000 
times the safe limit as determined by the most 
recent draft scientific assessment from the De-
partment of Health and Human Services. 
Included in this analysis was the Ellington 
Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, Texas, 
which tested at levels of 61,000 parts per tril-
lion. 
Clear and swift action from Congress is 
needed to address the PFAS crisis, and we 
need an all-hands-on-deck effort to protect 
both human health and our environment. 
This bipartisan legislation will ensure we’re 
treating PFAS as a hazardous chemical and 
giving our agencies the resources to clean up 
sites for the betterment of our communities. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 2467, the ‘‘PFAS Action Act of 2021.’’

HONORING DAVIE PINA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Davie Pina as 
the 
Napa 
County 
Farm 
Bureau’s 
2021 
Agriculturalist of the Year. 
A sixth generation Napa Valley farmer, 
Davie holds a strong and deep connection to 
the community. He attended high school lo-
cally at St. Helena High School and went on 
to attend college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
Davie became an assistant winemaker at 
Rutherford Hill Winery from 1973 to 1980. 
After seven years of extensive contributions 
toward the company, Davie joined John Pina 
Jr. & Sons Vineyard Management, where he 
continued to broaden his knowledge of viticul-
ture. Finally, in 1991, Davie became a man-
aging partner at Pina Vineyard Management, 
where he has worked ever since. 
Along with his demonstrated work ethic and 
commitment to agriculture, Davie has a rich 
history of civic engagement and service to the 
surrounding community. He served on the 
Board of Directors and as president of the 
Rutherford Dust Society, a group of commu-
nity members committed to promoting the 
highest standards possible for grape-growing 
and acting as good stewards to the land on 
which they grow grapes. Davie has also 
served on the Board of Directors and as presi-
dent of the Winegrowers of Napa County, and 
on the Board of Directors for the local Farm 
Bureau and the Rutherford Grange. 
In 1998, he became chair of the Rutherford 
Dust River Restoration team, which led efforts 
to restore the Napa River. In recognition of his 
outstanding contributions to the community, in 
2007, Davie was recognized by the Napa Val-
ley Grapegrowers as Grower of the Year. As 
part of his mission to assist his community, 
Davie has served with the Rutherford Volun-
teer Fire Department since 1987 and was its 
chief from 2012 to 2021. In recognition of his 
tremendous leadership to the department, he 
was recognized as the 2013 Fire Fighter of 
the Year. Davie has continuously pioneered 
innovative ways to approach sustainable agri-
culture in Napa Valley and is known through-
out Napa as someone committed to sustain-
ability and community service in all realms. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
Davie Pina’s achievements will leave a tre-
mendous impact on Napa Valley for genera-
tions to come. Therefore, it is fitting and prop-
er that we honor him here today.

July 22, 2021 
monetary equitable relief for all violations of 
the laws it enforces. 
Specifically, this bill would: 
Add a new subsection (e) to section 13 of 
the FTC Act that specifies types of equitable 
relief the FTC may pursue: restitution for 
losses, contract reformation and recission, 
money refunds, and the return of property; 
Provide the FTC disgorgement authority to 
seek court orders requiring bad actors repay 
unjust gains acquired in violation of the law. 
Clarify that the FTC may seek temporary re-
straining orders and preliminary injunctions 
without bond and that any relief sought under 
section 13(b) may be for past violations in ad-
dition to ongoing and imminent violations. 
As the Nation’s premier consumer protection 
agency, the FTC is directed to enforce numer-
ous statutes: the core of which is section 5 of 
the FTC Act mandating the agency to prevent 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair 
methods of competition. 
Section 13(b) of the FTC Act authorizes the 
FTC to bring suit in federal courts seeking re-
lief for consumers and is a critical enforcement 
tool the FTC uses to combat fraud and scams 
under section 5. 
In 2020 alone, the FTC returned more than 
$482 million to over 1.6 million consumer vic-
tims of fraud or illegal business practices. 
The FTC’s restitution authority under section 
13(b) was settled law for over 40 years, but 
beginning in 2017, the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals reversed its own precedent to 
overturn FTC authority under section 13(b) to 
obtain monetary relief and the Third Circuit 
soon followed. 
Because of these decisions, close to 48 mil-
lion Americans in six states became unable to 
obtain monetary redress under 13(b). 
Then, on April 22, 2021, the Supreme Court 
held in AMG Capital Management v. FTC that 
section 13(b) does not allow the FTC to seek 
monetary relief or require bad actors to return 
money earned through illegal activity. 
According to Acting Chairwoman Slaughter, 
the Supreme Court decision ‘‘deprived the 
FTC of the strongest tool [the FTC] had to 
help consumers.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, all five FTC Commissioners 
have repeatedly urged Congress to take quick 
action to pass legislation reaffirming FTC au-
thority under section 13(b). 
H.R. 2668 does exactly that, by restoring 
nearly forty years of precedent and giving the 
FTC the ability to protect Americans from 
scams and unethical business practices. 
Americans need this protection, because 
every day, and far too often, individuals in 
Texas and across the country fall victim to fi-
nancial scammers. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has given rise to 
an increase of scams and fraud that prey on 
consumers’ fears and financial insecurities, 
and inaction on this issue is not an option as 
it will only embolden bad actors. 
H.R. 2668 will ensure that the FTC main-
tains its ability to return money to the victims 
of scams. 
Seniors especially need this protection, be-
cause they have worked their entire lives with 
the promise of a safe and secure retirement, 
but scammers and unscrupulous businesses 
are taking advantage of uncertainty sur-
rounding the pandemic and working overtime 
to target them. 
Retirement accounts are not the only dam-
age these scams cause—they damage the 
independence and trust of a vulnerable com-
munity. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we have 
seen instances of fraud rise in unprecedented 
numbers, as scammers attempt to take advan-
tage of senior citizens and deprive them of 
their hard-earned savings. 
Bad actors preying on older Americans is, 
unfortunately, nothing new, but in the midst of 
a global pandemic impacting Americans’ lives 
and livelihoods, cracking down on those 
scams must be a priority. 
One such scam was thwarted by Houston 
police and the Harris County District Attorney, 
who made an arrest in February in an inter-
national cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, 
mostly elderly victims out of more than $1 mil-
lion. 
One victim of the scam, Asuncion Peppers, 
74, a retired medical technician knows that 
first hand; She was bilked out of her life sav-
ings. 
Hackers 
contacted 
Ms. 
Peppers 
on 
Facebook, pretending to be one of her 
Facebook friends. 
She was told she was eligible for a govern-
ment grant of almost one million dollars and 
all she had to do was send a check to pay 
taxes. 
Investigators believes the scammers were 
operating from Nigeria, defrauding senior citi-
zens in the U.S. and around the world. 
Before Ms. Peppers realized she was being 
conned, she sent checks totaling $87,000 
hard-earned money. 
She said that she worked three jobs to build 
her life savings. 
Ms. Peppers and her husband are just two 
of 38 victims bilked out of more than $1.3 mil-
lion before the fraud was discovered. 
This story is not an isolated incident: al-
though 1 in 20 seniors in the U.S. is a target 
of fraud schemes, the National Adult Protec-
tive Services Association has found that only 
1 in 44 seniors report that they are victims of 
a fraud scheme. 
During these unprecedented times, it is im-
perative that Congress pass legislation that 
protects U.S. consumers and honest busi-
nesses from wrongdoers who steal money 
through fraud and deception. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to strengthen federal 
prevention efforts and ensure leaders in the 
public and private sectors are collaborating on 
effective safeguards. 
This begins with ensuring that the FTC has 
the explicit authority to obtain both injunctive 
and monetary relief for all violations of the 
laws it enforces. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 2668, the ‘‘Consumer Protection 
and Recovery Act.’’

TRIBUTE TO ZAHRA SOMANI 
KARAMALI 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and profoundly thank a long 
time, super-star member of my staff, Zahra 
Somani Karamali. After serving in my district 
offices for thirteen years, Zahra is moving on 
to pursue a Ph.D. in Psychology and a career 
as a School Psychologist. It is hard for me to 
even imagine not having Zahra serving the 
residents of the 9th Congressional District as 
one of the most effective Constituent Advo-
cates in the country. Though not in my office, 
she will always be a beloved member of Team 
Schakowsky. 
Zahra Somani Karamali joined my office in 
2008, and she brought perspective, experi-
ence, and enthusiasm that have left a perma-
nent impact on our operations and on constitu-
ents’ lives. She is a dedicated public servant 
who readily established herself as a strong 
ally for individuals who would otherwise not 
have an effective voice. My husband and I 
had the joy of attending her wedding to 
Nauman and celebrating the birth and growth 
of their two wonderful children Ayman and 
Zayna. She and her family have become cher-
ished friends. 
Over the years, Zahra advocated for thou-
sands of constituents who needed help with a 
wide range of issues. She cut through red 
tape and solved difficult problems, often in life- 
changing ways. 
Zahra helped immigrant families who were 
pursuing green cards or struggling to obtain a 
visa to travel home to visit sick relatives. She 
helped reunite families, assisted refugees, and 
helped immigrants obtain naturalization status. 
She expedited passport applications so that 
mothers and fathers didn’t miss their daugh-
ters’ wedding abroad. When residents called 
because they had missing mail or delayed tax 
returns, Zahra provided an empathetic ear and 
an enthusiastic hand to help solve those 
issues. During the pandemic she helped con-
stituents who were stranded abroad and 
helped constituents obtain desperately needed 
stimulus checks and important benefits. She 
fought for constituents to receive all the bene-
fits they needed and deserved and tackled 
problems big and small with compassion and 
professionalism. 
Zahra is active in the Ismaili community and 
played an instrumental role in building and 
strengthening my and my office’s relationships 
with the Muslim community. I am proud to 
have stood alongside her and so many others 
in that community in good times and in bad, 
and I deeply cherish the relationships I’ve 
formed along the way. 
Zahra is always enthusiastic and willing to 
do whatever needs to be done. She rep-
resented me at office hours in libraries across 
the northwest suburbs, helped organize and 
conduct a wide array of events, and spoke on 
my behalf at events across the district. 
Zahra has been an essential member of the 
team, and a big reason why my office is well 
known for its effective constituent services. I 
will miss Zahra very much, as will everyone on 
the staff. I expect to hear from many constitu-
ents who will be very disappointed to hear that 
Zahra is no longer there to help. We pledge to 
her that we will all work hard to fill the gap. I 
know that the fortunate students and families 
she will serve in the years ahead will benefit 
from the wonderous gifts that have made 
Zahra so invaluable to me.

HONORING WENDY BALDO 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of a longtime friend, Wendy Baldo, who 
will soon begin her well-deserved retirement. 
Wendy first came to work in Arizona state 
government in 1988, during the administration 
of Governor Rose Mofford. In 1993, she 
began her long and distinguished career with 
the Arizona State Senate. In 2009, Wendy 
was hired as chief of staff for the legislative 
body, a role in which she has now served for 
more than 12 years. 
I came to know Wendy while serving in the 
Arizona state legislature from 2002 to 2016. 
My election to the Arizona Senate in 2010 pro-
vided me the opportunity to work under 
Wendy’s guidance, and she continued to 
serve as my chief of staff for the four years I 
served as Arizona Senate President. Wendy 
was always a trusted advisor. She staunchly 
protected the institution of the Senate and was 
the fierce, loyal ally every leader needs. It is 
a rare occurrence in the Arizona Senate for a 
chief of staff to serve multiple Senate presi-
dents. Wendy’s service to five presidents is a 
true testament to her character and caliber. 
The knowledge and expertise Wendy has 
accumulated in her years in the Arizona Sen-
ate are an invaluable resource. Her retirement, 
while well-deserved, will undoubtedly be a loss 
for the Senate. I thank Wendy for her many 
years of service to the people of Arizona and 
wish her well in this next phase of her life.

REMEMBERING HARRY M. 
ROSENFELD 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer the thanks of a grateful nation for the 
life and work of former Washington Post Metro 
editor Harry M. Rosenfeld who guided the 
newspaper in its Pulitzer Prize-winning Water-
gate coverage. Mr. Rosenfeld died last week 
at the age of 91. A survivor of Berlin’s 
Kristallnacht in 1938, he and his family immi-
grated to New York City in March of 1939, just 
months before World War II began. After grad-
uating from Syracuse University and a stint in 
the U.S. Army, Mr. Rosenfeld joined the New 
York Herald Tribune syndicate and rose to 
managing editor before joining The Post. Edi-
tor Ben Bradlee made him assistant managing 
editor for metropolitan news where he inher-
ited a staff of hungry reporters covering local 
beats, among them Carl Bernstein. Mr. 
Rosenfeld later hired a very persistent Bob 
Woodward. 
The 
double-byline 
stories 
of 
Woodward and Bernstein, covering scandal 
and corruption in the Nixon administration, 
eventually led to Nixon’s 1974 resignation. He 
ended his career as the editor of newspapers 
in Albany, New York. I offer my condolences 
to his wife Anne and his three daughters and 
his extended family. Mr. Rosenfeld’s enduring 
sense of justice and demand for accountability 
helped change American history and inspired 
a generation of journalists. His passion for the 
truth and for journalism was an inspiration and 
a model to be emulated. His was a life well 
led.

SUCCESS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, during the 
COVID–19 crisis, we have seen how crucial 
internet access has been for learning and 
completing assignments. The homework gap, 
experienced by as many as 17 million stu-
dents in the U.S. who do not have internet ac-
cess at home, is an inequity that predates the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
When I first began talking about this issue, 
I was shocked and saddened to recognize 
there were so many misconceptions about 
who was part of the homework gap. So many 
of my colleagues believed the homework gap 
is something that predominantly affects stu-
dents in rural America. But in fact, one in five 
school-age children in NYC’s public school 
system—the largest public school system in 
the country—do not have internet access at 
home. 
The nature of homework assignments has 
fundamentally changed. Before, all you need-
ed was a pencil and paper. But that is no 
longer the norm. Internet access is essential 
to completing homework assignments. It broke 
my heart to hear stories of families parked 
outside McDonalds or Starbucks trying to 
catch a free Wi-Fi signal. 
Closing the homework gap extends beyond 
just helping our students finish their home-
work. Internet connectivity is essential to suc-
cess in the 21st century; much like electricity 
was important in the 1930s, internet will be the 
same, if not more. 
That is why Congress passed the Emer-
gency Educational Connections Act as part of 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a bill 
that I proudly championed with Senator MAR-
KEY. This provision created the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund, and provided a one-time 
$7.17 billion appropriation to connect students 
and library patrons learning at home. 
As our Nation works to move past the pan-
demic, we must finally close the full homework 
gap that predates the ongoing emergency. 
That is why I am proud to introduce today the 
Securing 
Universal 
Communications 
Connectivity to Ensure Students Succeed or 
the SUCCESS Act. This bill would provide $8 
billion a year over five years (for a total of $40 
billion) to extend the FCC’s Emergency 
Connectivity Fund, without an emergency time 
frame, so that schools and libraries can con-
tinue supporting distance learning after the 
coronavirus pandemic is over. This extended 
program will then ensure that students con-
nected by the emergency connectivity fund do 
not lose their internet access and devices 
once the original funds run dry. 
Madam Speaker, as the mother of two 
young children, I know firsthand how crucial 
this issue is. Each and every student must 
have the tools they need to succeed in school, 
and the SUCCESS Act is an essential compo-
nent to permanently closing the homework 
gap. I urge all of my colleagues in both cham-
bers to help close this digital divide for good. 
SERIOUS ISSUES FACING OUR 
COUNTRY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 21, 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I’m here to 
point out just how interconnected the climate 
emergency is to America’s housing crisis and 
how it impacts communities of color. 
We are living in a climate emergency. 
Wildfires are raging, sea levels are rising, and 
severe weather events are getting stronger. 
Meanwhile homes are being destroyed, and 
not nearly enough is being done to address 
environmental racism and the ways in which 
communities of color across this country suffer 
disproportionately from a lack of action. We 
cannot stand by as corporations, big oil, and 
industry titans pollute the air we breathe and 
contaminate the water we drink without con-
sequence. 
The truth is that these negative environ-
mental factors compound social and economic 
conditions, and lead to higher levels of chronic 
health problems such as asthma, diabetes, 
and hypertension in communities of color and 
low-income communities. It should surprise no 
one that on average, people of color comprise 
56 percent of the population living in neighbor-
hoods with facilities that release toxic sub-
stances into the air and water supply. 
This is a fair housing issue and a direct re-
sult of systemic racism and historically racist 
policies, including redlining and exclusionary 
zoning, that segregate low-income people and 
people of color into areas that have suffered 
from decades of disinvestment. These seg-
regated areas are often located closer to in-
dustrial districts and are therefore more likely 
to be deprived of green spaces, healthy 
homes, and clean drinking water. None of this 
is news. But, because of worsening residential 
segregation, the increasingly harmful effects of 
climate change and extreme weather events 
are exacerbating these conditions in low-in-
come communities and communities of color. 
Today, formerly redlined communities suffer 
from hotter temperatures, and their homes are 
25 percent more likely to experience damage 
due to flooding compared to communities that 
were not redlined. In some cases, whether 
due to repeated flooding or because they are 
located at higher elevations, low-income com-
munities of color, such as in Puerto Rico and 
Florida, are facing displacement, known as cli-
mate gentrification. 
The real-life examples are far too plenty. 
Take for example, St. James Parish, Lou-
isiana—a community that is often referred to 
as ‘‘Cancer Alley.’’ I traveled there in 2001 to 
bring international attention to corporate pollu-
tion and the human costs of that pollution on 
communities of color. St. James Parish has a 
long history of inequality. The parish is located 
along the lower Mississippi River where 
enslaved Africans were forced to labor. Today, 
it serves as an industrial hub, with nearly 150 
oil refineries, plastics plants, and chemical fa-
cilities. Not only have these facilities polluted 
the surrounding water and air, but they have 
also subjected the mostly African American 
residents of St. James Parish to cancer, res-
piratory diseases, and other health problems. 
In 2005, we saw how Hurricane Katrina im-
pacted people of color in New Orleans. Lives

were taken, whole communities were abso-
lutely ravaged, and homes were destroyed. 
Even after seeing that level of destruction, not 
enough action has been taken to make sure 
that homes are resilient and safe from ex-
treme weather events, especially those lo-
cated in the hardest hit communities. 
And just last year, in the middle of the pan-
demic, Georgia and Tennessee experienced 
deadly tornados that damaged and demol-
ished more than 2,000 homes. In the wake of 
California’s 2018 wildfires—the deadliest in the 
state’s history—82 percent of homes that were 
built to pre-2008 standards were damaged. 
The need to ensure our homes and commu-
nities are sited and built more equitably and 
resiliently is more critical than ever before. 
And so, I want to make it clear that Amer-
ica’s housing infrastructure is vulnerable to the 
growing costs of climate change and weather 
disasters, which will only accelerate the need 
for maintenance and repair, or it will make our 
housing infrastructure uninhabitable. Between 
2016 and 2020, these disasters have cost 
nearly $616 billion in damages and have dis-
placed tens of thousands of people from their 
homes. We cannot keep asking people to live 
like this. We must act now. 
As Chairwoman of the House Committee on 
Financial Services, I recently introduced my 
historic Housing Is Infrastructure Act of 2021, 
which provides over $600 billion to increase 
our nation’s green, inclusive, affordable hous-
ing infrastructure. I’m fighting for the type of 
investments that will bring our housing stock 
into the 21st century and beyond, including 
working to address environmental racism and 
the climate emergency, strengthening our na-
tion’s commitment to fair housing, and recog-
nizing that housing IS infrastructure.

HONORING DIANE DILLON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Diane Dillon as 
the recipient of the Napa County Farm Bu-
reau’s 2021 Friend of Agriculture for her ongo-
ing work in serving Napa Valley’s agricultural 
community. 
As a fifth-generation Napa County resident, 
Diane has been an active community member 
for as long as she can remember. A UC Santa 
Barbara alumna, she graduated with a B.A. in 
Cultural Anthropology with Honors then contin-
ued her education at UCLA where she re-
ceived her master’s in library and information 
science. Diane went on to receive her J.D. 
from UC Davis in 1981 where she was a 
member of numerous school organizations. 
Since 2003, Diane has been serving on the 
Napa County Board of Supervisors as District 
3 representative. As a Supervisor, Diane has 
made it a mission to better understand the in-
tricacies of the state budget and finance sys-
tem. To that end, she was asked to serve on 
the statewide Cities Counties Schools (CCS) 
Partnership 2009 Joint Task Force on Fiscal 
Reform. In January 2010, Diane held the first 
ever county-wide conference involving the 
county, municipalities, and school representa-
tives. 
Throughout her career, Diane has tirelessly 
worked with the agricultural community to un-
derstand and address the complex issues they 
face. As a co-organizer and member of ‘‘Get 
a Grip on Growth,’’ she helped protect a 900+ 
acre piece of land from becoming developed 
into a commercial building area. Furthermore, 
Diane was co-chair on the ‘‘No on W & X 
Committee’’ where she received the Out-
standing Service Award from United Napa Val-
ley Associates for her resolute work. Diane is 
regarded as a passionate and dedicated mem-
ber of the community and is recognized for 
her hard work to protect the scenic resources 
and beautiful lands of Napa County’s agricul-
tural industry. She is an excellent example of 
what it means to be a hard-working elected 
representative and a role model to many in 
leadership and the agricultural sector. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
Diane Dillon’s achievements will leave a tre-
mendous impact in our community for genera-
tions to come. Therefore, it is fitting and prop-
er that we honor her here today.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
ROBERT ‘‘RENNY’’ CUSHING 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Robert ‘‘Renny’’ Cushing, 
who has led a remarkable life dedicated to so-
cial activism and public service. His selfless 
determination 
to 
secure 
equitable 
social 
change for the communities he has served is 
a true testament to our country’s civic spirit. 
His journey began at the young age of 15 
while advocating alongside civil rights activist 
Allard Lowenstein to end the Vietnam War and 
to lower the voting age nationwide. A year 
later, he left Hampton, New Hampshire with 
only $40 in his pocket and an itch to see the 
world. Renny soon traveled thousands of 
miles and worked numerous blue-collar jobs. 
He picked oranges in Florida, plucked grapes 
in the San Joaquin Valley of California, col-
lected waste in Atlanta and harvested tobacco 
in Mexico. After a few years of travelling, he 
decided to bring all the knowledge he acquired 
about people and life back home. 
When he returned to Hampton, Renny co- 
founded the Clamshell Alliance, a group that 
would protest the construction of a nuclear 
station that individuals and families throughout 
his community voted against. He also later co- 
founded the Murder Victims’ Families for 
Human Rights, an international non-govern-
ment organization of family members of mur-
der victims fearlessly dedicated to opposing 
the death penalty. Renny, whose father was 
tragically murdered, spent decades advocating 
for the abolishment of New Hampshire’s death 
penalty law, which the state did repeal in 
2019. 
He officially began his career as a legislator 
in 1986, after winning his first election as a 
Representative of the New Hampshire State 
House. Following multiple non-consecutive 
terms, Renny was nominated as the Demo-
cratic Leader of the New Hampshire State 
House of Representatives in 2020. While serv-
ing as the Democratic Leader, Renny received 
a heartbreaking stage four prostate cancer di-
agnosis after he was hospitalized with acute 
kidney failure. 
Renny did not allow this devastating news 
to deter his commitment to serving others. 
Now the Democratic Minority Leader, Renny 
continues to serve in the New Hampshire 
State House where he has fought to ensure 
remote access to House hearings for disabled 
legislators, expand availability of medical mari-
juana for cancer patients and ensure the re-
moval of harmful PFAS chemicals in nearby 
wells. 
Renny has devoted his life to the betterment 
of our nation and our communities and the up-
lifting of all our people. His unwavering com-
mitment and tenacious attitude even in the 
toughest of times exemplify what it means to 
be a patriotic American. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
the important accomplishments of Robert 
‘‘Renny’’ Cushing, and I hope this Chamber 
will join me in celebrating his remarkable life 
and career.

HONORING JAMES W. FLINT 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend and a champion of 
the LGBTQ community, James W. Flint, on his 
80th birthday. 
At just 17, Jim enlisted in the Navy. He 
quickly became an accomplished service 
member before returning home to Illinois. 
Since the early 1960s, Jim has been the life-
blood of Chicago’s LGBTQ+ community, dedi-
cating his time, resources, and talents to ex-
panding and creating the LGBTQ nightlife 
scene. For over 60 years, Jim has been a 
trailblazer and inspiration to many across the 
state of Illinois and beyond, and has been a 
committed activist and business leader. 
He started his career as a bartender and 
quickly became the entrepreneur we know and 
love by opening his first locale, the Baton 
Show Lounge, in downtown Chicago. It was a 
first of its kind drag bar, featuring drag queen 
entertainers before these kinds of shows be-
came as popular as they are today. In the 
decades since, Jim has owned many fabulous 
establishments, including Annex 2, Annex 3, 
Redoubt, Redoubt Atlanta, and River North 
Travel, in addition to the Baton Show Lounge, 
which is still open today and was recently relo-
cated to my very own 9th Congressional dis-
trict. 
In addition to his extraordinary bars, in 
1980, Jim founded the Miss Gay Continental 
Pageant, a national level drag showcase. He 
was motivated to start the pageant when he 
learned that many other pageants were dis-
criminating against drag performers we would 
today identify as transgender. At that time, 
many of the pageants created rules and bar-
riers that excluded entertainers that were living 
as women or who had any kind of plastic sur-
gery. Today, now known as the Miss Conti-
nental Pageant, it has expanded to a pageant 
system that celebrates male and female enter-
tainers from all across the country and around 
the world, and occurs in Chicago annually. 
He was also a co-founder of the Windy City 
Athletic Association, which gave LGBTQ 
Chicagoans the opportunity to compete in 
amateur athletics with their counterparts from 
all across the nation.

July 22, 2021 
Jim’s deep community roots quickly posi-
tioned him as an activist and community orga-
nizer. In 1986 he ran for the Cook County 
Board of Commissioners, and although his bid 
was not successful, it was groundbreaking as 
he was one of the first openly gay people to 
run for public office in Illinois. 
As is the case for all trailblazers, Jim has 
faced and overcome significant challenges in 
his personal and professional life. From wit-
nessing rampant domestic violence, drug 
abuse, and homicide within the LGBTQ com-
munity to the many lives we lost to the AIDS 
epidemic in Chicago and across the country, 
Jim has withstood phenomenal pain. 
Throughout times of unthinkable tragedy, 
Jim’s warm energy and generous spirit have 
never wavered. His drive; compassion, and 
fantastic flamboyance are remarkable and 
have allowed him to be incredibly successful. 
He has played a tremendous role in shaping 
the LGBTQ community around the country, 
and his impact on the City of Chicago is im-
measurable. As a businessman in the LGBTQ 
and Chicago community, he has blazed trails 
and opened doors for so many others. 
And as a public servant, activist and com-
munity leader, he has made sure that the 
needs of the LGBTQ community were not ig-
nored by our government. I am honored to call 
Jim a friend and wish him all the best and 
continued success. 
TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEM-
BERS 
FOR 
THEIR 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEO-
PLE 
OF 
THE 
18TH 
CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND 
THE UNITED STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 22, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, in 
these tumultuous days of crisis and challenge, 
Members of Congress know well, perhaps bet-
ter than most, how blessed our nation is to 
have in reserve such exceptional young men 
and women who will go on to become leaders 
in their local communities, states, and the na-
tion in the areas of business, education, law, 
government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, 
and the military. 
We know this because we see them and 
benefit from their contributions every day. 
Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-
ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-
terns and they do amazing work for and on 
behalf of the constituents we are privileged to 
represent. 
Madam Speaker, I believe there is no higher 
calling than the call to serve a cause larger 
than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-
fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-
nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country 
can do for you, ask what you can do for your 
country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of 
grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By this measure, there are several other 
great young men and women who served as 
volunteers this year in my offices. They braved 
the dangers of the pandemic that has wrought 
so much suffering and heartbreak across our 
nation. They cheerfully do their duty in the 
U.S. Capitol complex that just six months ago 
was the site of an insurrection attack not seen 
since the War of 1812. These dedicated and 
public-spirited men and women may toil in ob-
scurity but their contributions to the constitu-
ents we serve are deeply appreciated. That is 
why today I rise to pay tribute to five extraor-
dinary young persons for their service to my 
constituents in the 18th Congressional District 
of Texas and to the American people. They 
are: 
Alejandro 
Garcia 
Escobar 
Plascencia, 
Georgetown University; 
Jacqueline White Menchaca, Arizona State 
University; 
Idia Irele, Smith College and Harvard Uni-
versity; 
Anthony Collier, Texas Southern University; 
and 
Valencia Shuler, Rice University. 
Madam Speaker, the energy, intelligence, 
and idealism these wonderful young people 
brought to my office and those interning in the 
offices of my colleagues help keep our democ-
racy vibrant. The insights, skills, and knowl-
edge of the governmental process they gain 
from their experiences will last a lifetime and 
prove invaluable to them as they go about 
making their mark in this world. 
Because of persons like them the future of 
our country is bright, and its best days lie 
ahead. I wish them all well. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that such 
thoughtful committed young men and women 
can be found working in my office, those of 
my colleagues, and in every community in 
America. Their good works will keep America 
great, good, and forever young.
