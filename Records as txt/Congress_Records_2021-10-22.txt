PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, You have asked of us, above all 
things, to love our neighbor. Help us to 
live into that difficult yet simple com-
mandment. 
The other half of that command is 
not easy either, that we are to love 
them as we love ourselves. Holy God, 
for a variety of reasons, loving our-
selves is often difficult. 
Remind us that You first loved us. 
Your love has forgiven us all our 
faults, excused our shortcomings. May 
we bask in that redemption with grati-
tude for Your mercy. 
Then, as we turn to our neighbors— 
those we find in our communities, in 
our country, in this Chamber—enable 
us to understand that what we do to 
them should be a reflection of what 
You have so mercifully done for us. 
If in response to Your willingness to 
love us—allowing us to discover our 
worth, our value—then we will be will-
ing to love them, and our neighbors 
will be encouraged and strengthened 
and our relationship with them trans-
formed. 
God of love, we pray that this day, we 
would remain faithful to Your Golden 
Rule and live as examples of Your mer-
ciful and gracious love. 
In Your redemptive name we pray. 
Amen.

WILSON) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

REMEMBERING DR. TIMUEL BLACK 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, last week, Chicago and the 
Nation lost a great champion for jus-
tice and civil rights, Dr. Timuel Black. 
As a World War II veteran and a lead-
er in the Black community that came 
to Chicago during the great migration, 
Tim always challenged the inequities 
he witnessed in the United States and 
abroad. 
In his 102 years, Tim was a historian, 
educator, author, and civil rights ac-
tivist. He inspired generations to fight 
for racial and social justice. 
He fought alongside Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., and helped organize the 
march on Washington. He registered 
voters and raised funds to elect Harold 
Washington, the first Black mayor of 
Chicago, in 1983. He mentored the first 
Black President of the United States, 
Barack Obama. 
On a personal note, I will always be 
grateful for Tim’s support during my 
mayoral campaign in 2015. He said he 
supported me as someone who was able 
to communicate with everyone and 
transcend racial lines. 
Tim profoundly shaped the struggle 
for civil rights in Chicago and across 
the country. I will seek to honor him 
by following his example and fighting 
for the voiceless in our city. 
Rest in power, Tim Black.

REMEMBERING OFFICER DAVID 
HORTON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Darien 
Police 
Officer 
David 
Horton 
of 
Ludowici, Georgia, who sadly passed 
away at the age of 45. David was a re-
spected and honored member of his 
community. 
After graduating from law enforce-
ment training in 2014, he began his ca-
reer with the Long County Sheriff’s Of-
fice. 
David had a heart for service and was 
awarded numerous accolades during his 
time in law enforcement. As an agency 
DUI Hero award winner, David was the 
definition of protect and serve. 
He was not only a dedicated law en-
forcement officer but also a devoted fa-
ther and citizen who was loved and re-
spected by many. 
I am thankful for David’s lifetime of 
service and commitment to his com-
munity. I know his legacy will be for-
ever treasured. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

PRESIDENT 
GEORGE 
W. 
BUSH’S 
REMARKS ON THE 10TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF 9/11 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, and 
Members of the House, last month, on 
the 10th anniversary of 9/11, former 
President George W. Bush delivered re-
marks commemorating the heroism of 
the crew and passengers of United 
Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. 
The former President’s words were a 
welcome reminder, Madam Speaker, of 
what it looks like for an American 
leader to call us together in unity. His 
words were compassionate, inspiring, 
and patriotic. 
Madam Speaker, he and I have had 
many differences over the years when 
it comes to policy. During his Presi-
dency, I opposed much of his governing 
agenda. He did the same, opposing 
many of Democrats’ plans when we 
came into the majority in 2007. 
We respected one another, we were 
able to work together with one an-
other, and we both had at the center of 
our philosophy the best interests of the 
United States of America and its peo-
ple. We always approached each other 
with civility, with seriousness, and 
with a shared respect for each other’s 
patriotism. 
We never questioned each other’s 
love of our country or that we were 
doing what we thought was best for the 
safety and security of the American 
people. 
I hope that President Bush’s message 
will inspire my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, from the former Presi-
dent’s own party and, indeed, all Amer-
icans and all of us, to remember what 
that kind of leadership looks like after 
4 years of a President who did not call 
us to unity, who did not encourage ci-
vility or common cause, and who 
furthered our divides instead of bridged 
them. 
I hope as well that we in this House 
can strive to heal the divisions in our 
country and embrace the kind of lead-
ership that President Bush displayed 
last month and that together, as 
Democrats and Republicans, we can 
work toward a better tomorrow for all 
of our fellow Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD President Bush’s full remarks. 
REMARKS BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AT 
FLIGHT
93 NATIONAL
MEMORIAL
IN
COM-
MEMORATION OF THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
9/11 ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2021 
‘‘Thank you very much. Laura and I are 
honored to be with you. Madam Vice Presi-
dent, Vice President Cheney. Governor Wolf, 
Secretary Haaland, and distinguished guests: 
‘‘Twenty years ago, we all found—in dif-
ferent ways, in different places, but all at 
the same moment—that our lives would be 
changed forever. The world was loud with 
carnage and sirens, and then quiet with 
missing voices that would never be heard 
again. These lives remain precious to our 
country, and infinitely precious to many of 
you. Today we remember your loss, we share 
your sorrow, and we honor the men and 
women you have loved so long and so well. 
‘‘For those too young to recall that clear 
September day, it is hard to describe the mix 
of feelings we experienced. There was horror 
at the scale of destruction, and awe at the 
bravery and kindness that rose to meet it. 
There was shock at the audacity of evil, and 
gratitude for the heroism and decency that 
opposed it. In the sacrifice of the first re-
sponders, in the mutual aid of strangers, in 
the solidarity of grief and grace, the actions 
of an enemy revealed the spirit of a people. 
And we were proud of our wounded nation. 
‘‘In these memories, the passengers and 
crew of Flight 93 must always have an hon-
ored place. Here the intended targets became 
the instruments of rescue. And many who 
are now alive owe a vast, unconscious debt 
to the defiance displayed in the skies above 
this field. 
‘‘It would be a mistake to idealize the ex-
perience of those terrible events. All that 
many people could initially see was the 
brute randomness of death. All that many 
could feel was unearned suffering. All that 
many could hear was God’s terrible silence. 
There are many who still struggle with a 
lonely pain that cuts deep within. 
‘‘In those fateful hours, we learned other 
lessons as well. We saw that Americans were 
vulnerable, but not fragile—that they pos-
sess a core of strength that survives the 
worst that life can bring. We learned that 
bravery is more common than we imagined, 
emerging with sudden splendor in the face of 
death. We vividly felt how every hour with 
our loved ones is a temporary and holy gift. 
And we found that even the longest days end. 
‘‘Many of us have tried to make spiritual 
sense of these events. There is no simple ex-
planation for the mix of Providence and 
human will that sets the direction of our 
lives. But comfort can come from a different 
sort of knowledge. After wandering long and 
lost in the dark, many have found they were 
actually walking, step by step, toward grace. 
‘‘As a nation, our adjustments have been 
profound. Many Americans struggled to un-
derstand why an enemy would hate us with 
such zeal. The security measures incor-
porated into our lives are both sources of 
comfort and reminders of our vulnerability. 
And we have seen growing evidence that the 
dangers to our country can come not only 
across borders, but from violence that gath-
ers within. There is little cultural overlap 
between violent extremists abroad and vio-
lent extremists at home. But in their disdain 
for pluralism, in their disregard for human 
life, in their determination to defile national 
symbols, they are children of the same foul 
spirit. And it is our continuing duty to con-
front them. 
‘‘After 9/11, millions of brave Americans 
stepped forward and volunteered to serve in 
the Armed Forces. The military measures 
taken over the last 20 years to pursue dan-
gers at their source have led to debate. But 
one thing is certain: We owe an assurance to 
all who have fought our nation’s most recent 
battles. Let me speak directly to veterans 
and people in uniform: The cause you pur-
sued at the call of duty is the noblest Amer-
ica has to offer. You have shielded your fel-
low citizens from danger. You have defended 
the beliefs of your country and advanced the 
rights of the downtrodden. You have been 
the face of hope and mercy in dark places. 
You have been a force for good in the world. 
Nothing that has followed—nothing—can 
tarnish your honor or diminish your accom-
plishments. To you, and to the honored dead, 
our country is forever grateful. 
‘‘In the weeks and months following the 9/ 
11 attacks, I was proud to lead an amazing, 
resilient, united people. When it comes to 
the unity of America, those days seems dis-
tant from our own. A malign force seems at 
work in our common life that turns every 
disagreement into an argument, and every 
argument into a clash of cultures. So much 
of our politics has become a naked appeal to 
anger, fear, and resentment. That leaves us 
worried about our nation and our future to-
gether. 
‘‘I come without explanations or solutions. 
I can only tell you what I have seen. 
‘‘On America’s day of trial and grief, I saw 
millions of people instinctively grab for a 
neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one 
another. That is the America I know. 
‘‘At a time when religious bigotry might 
have flowed freely, I saw Americans reject 
prejudice and embrace people of Muslim 
faith. That is the nation I know. 
‘‘At a time when nativism could have 
stirred hatred and violence against people 
perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaf-
firm their welcome of immigrants and refu-
gees. That is the nation I know. 
‘‘At a time when some viewed the rising 
generation as individualistic and decadent, I 
saw young people embrace an ethic of service 
and rise to selfless action. That is the nation 
I know. 
‘‘This is not mere nostalgia; it is the truest 
version of ourselves. It is what we have 
been—and what we can be again. 
‘‘Twenty years ago, terrorists chose a ran-
dom group of Americans, on a routine flight, 
to be collateral damage in a spectacular act 
of terror. The 33 passengers and 7 crew of 
Flight 93 could have been any group of citi-
zens selected by fate. In that sense, they 
stood in for us all. 
‘‘The terrorists soon discovered that a ran-
dom group of Americans is an exceptional 
group of people. Facing an impossible cir-
cumstance, they comforted their loved ones 
by phone, braced each other for action, and 
defeated the designs of evil. 
‘‘These Americans were brave, strong, and 
united in ways that shocked the terrorists— 
but should not surprise any of us. This is the 
nation we know. And whenever we need hope 
and inspiration, we can look to the skies and 
remember.

AMERICA IS EXPERIENCING AN 
ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
KELLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America is experiencing an energy cri-
sis. The price of oil, a gallon of gas, 
electricity, and natural gas are all top-
ping 7-year highs. But what does that 
really mean for the American people? 
It means less money to buy groceries 
and more money at the gas pump; it 
means less money to take care of your 
kids and more money to heat your 
home; and it means less money for 
your healthcare and more money for 
overhead to run your business. That is 
a terrible tradeoff for every American 
working hard to support their families. 
It is only happening because the 
Biden administration is intent on im-
plementing policies that make it hard-
er for American energy producers to 
develop cleaner, more affordable en-
ergy right here at home. 
President Biden must wake up and 
see that there is only one way to re-
verse this course: Embrace American 
energy. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE OBERLIN 
VILLAGE COMMUNITY 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the history and the 
legacy of the Oberlin Village commu-
nity. 
Founded in 1866, Oberlin Village is 
one of the last surviving antebellum 
settlements founded by free Black peo-
ple in North Carolina. 
After Reconstruction, the commu-
nity became a welcoming refuge for 
newly freed former slaves from the 
nearby Cameron plantation. 
It became much more than a town. 
The thriving municipality was home to 
rows 
of 
single-family 
houses, 
two 
churches, and a public school. It be-
came a symbol of land ownership for 
freedmen. 
The local post office, now located in 
a building owned by the Oberlin Bap-
tist Church, is still named after the 
plantation rather than this historic 
community. I urge the Postal Service 
to change the name to reflect the post 
office’s new location and to commemo-
rate the Oberlin Village community 
and its legacy. 
f 
BIDEN’S CRISIS CREATION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, Tim Murtaugh, a vis-
iting fellow at The Heritage Founda-
tion, correctly wrote: ‘‘President Joe 
Biden is drowning in a sea of crises of 
his own creation, and Americans are 
the ones who are paying the price. 
‘‘There’s an ongoing humanitarian 
and national security calamity at the 
southern border. 
‘‘Thirteen U.S. servicemembers are 
dead, and an unknown number of our 
citizens remain stranded in Afghani-
stan following Biden’s disastrous with-
drawal. 
‘‘Americans are not taking the mil-
lions of jobs available . . . as many 
have chosen the option of being paid by 
the government to stay home instead 
of working. 
‘‘And energy prices continue to rise, 
helping to drive mounting inflation 
. . . 
‘‘Such a callous dismissal of real- 
world issues . . . simply feeds the pre-
vailing belief that Biden simply is bad 
at his job.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
South Carolina Senate Finance Chair-
man Hugh Leatherman for a speedy re-
covery. 
f 
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
DELAYS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention to the signifi-
cant mail backlogs we are experiencing 
in northern Ohio, across the whole re-
gion, Cleveland to Toledo, impacting 
the timely and reliable delivery of 
mail. 
Postal 
employees 
do 
remarkable 
work every day to execute their mis-
sion. 
To the tens of thousands of military 
veterans who work for the Postal Serv-
ice, we owe you an enormous debt of 
gratitude for your continued loyal 
service to our Nation. 
However, the decision by the U.S. 
Postal Service Board of Directors and 
management to implement disastrous 
policies to consolidate processing cen-
ters and ship local mail hundreds of 
miles away to be sorted elsewhere is 
truly illogical. 
While we are finally seeing incre-
mental progress being made, our region 
is still in desperate need for construc-
tive solutions to the backups and slow 
processing people are enduring on the 
ground. 
I will continue working with my col-
leagues from across our country and 
across the aisle until we bring about 
new Postal Service leadership and fully 
restore the service our people and com-
munities richly deserve and expect. 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
last night on television, I listened as 
Jen Psaki—I don’t know whether it 
was from yesterday or a replay from 
something a month ago—wondered why 
President Biden should go to the bor-
der. Having been down there, I want to 
educate her as to why. 
First of all, she would find we have a 
shortage of Border Patrol. Well over 
10,000 unaccompanied minors a month 
are coming across the border, and be-
cause they have to deal with them, 
they are not able to guard the border. 
Rather than giving free college for 
illegals, you could get some more Bor-
der Patrol agents. 
Secondly, he would get to know that 
the Border Patrol agents are wonderful 
people, so that in the future, when 
agents on horses are charging a group 
of Haitians who are assaulting some 
woman, our hate-filled President does 
not attack the Border Patrol. 
Third, she can find out that immi-
grants are right now routinely throw-
ing away identification cards so that 
we can’t do background checks on 
them. 
Fourth, I always knew immigrants 
who tested positive for COVID are 
being let in. I was not aware that Bor-
der Patrol has a policy that we can 
never even force immigrants to take 
the tests. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

REMEMBERING VICTORIA BACA 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the life of Moreno 
Valley City Councilwoman, and true 
public servant, Victoria Baca. 
As the first Latina elected to the city 
council, Victoria broke barriers and 
paved the way for so many others to 
follow in her footsteps. 
I knew Victoria during her time on 
the city council and remember her as 
someone who was fiercely loyal to her 
community. 
Victoria also served on the board of 
the Moreno Valley Unified School Dis-
trict, where she was a strong advocate 
for special education services in the In-
land Empire and dedicated her time in 
office to protecting and uplifting stu-
dents. 
She genuinely cared about others and 
worked tirelessly to make a lasting dif-
ference. Her legacy with respect to edu-
cation, diversity, and economic growth 
in Moreno Valley will always be ad-
mired.

BIDEN PILES UP RED TAPE 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, it ap-
pears that the Biden administration is 
going to do everything it possibly can 
to destroy our economy and hurt work-
ing-class people. 
Headline 
in 
today’s 
Washington 
Times: ‘‘Biden piles up red tape after 
Trump’s trims: Long arm of regulation 
reaches businesses for vague objec-
tives.’’ 
‘‘President Biden accelerated the reg-
ulatory state on his first day in office 
by ordering agencies to consider aspi-
rational but vaguely defined goals and 
benefits when imposing new rules on 
businesses large and small. 
‘‘The order greenlighting regulations 
even when the benefits ‘are difficult or 
impossible to quantify’ sent shudders 
down the spines of CEOs. They fear 
business growth will be smothered in 
pursuit of vague objectives such as 
‘human dignity’ and ‘the interests of 
future generations.’ 
‘‘ ‘It is the most aggressive thing I 
have ever seen by an administration,’ 
said Doug Holtz-Eakin. ‘It is one thing 
to put out a bunch of regulations, but 
this changes the way regulation is 
done. It allows you to jam through any 
regulation you want regardless of the 
impact [on] the private sector.’ ’’ 
We know we are having historic in-
creased inflation and historic debt lev-
els and now regulations. It is a disaster 
coming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5799 
October 22, 2021 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and insert extraneous 
material on H.R. 3110, the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today the House has 
an opportunity to pass H.R. 3110, the 
Providing Urgent Maternal Protections 
for Nursing Mothers Act, or the PUMP 
for Nursing Mothers Act, a bipartisan 
bill that would strengthen workplace 
protections for nursing mothers. 
Nursing mothers should have a clear 
right to break time and a clean, pri-
vate space to pump breast milk at 
work. As we have heard from health ex-
perts and worker advocates across the 
country, these basic accommodations 
ensure that nursing mothers can bal-
ance their work, their health, and the 
health of their babies. 
Regrettably, many nursing mothers 
still do not have these protections. 
Under current law, millions of work-
ers—including farmworkers, transpor-
tation workers, and teachers—are cur-
rently excluded from Federal protec-
tions for nursing employees. 
The nursing mothers who are covered 
by existing law have limited recourse 
when their rights are violated. 
To close these gaps, the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act expands existing 
protections for nursing mothers for 
nearly 9 million employees who are 
currently left out. It provides nursing 
workers with access to meaningful 
remedies when employers fail to pro-
vide appropriate time and pumping 
space. 
Importantly, this bill includes an 
amendment to clarify that congres-
sional employees are covered by these 
protections and to address safety con-
cerns by including airline crew mem-
bers break time to pump during a 
flight. 
No working American should be 
forced to choose between going to work 
and staying healthy, so we must take 
this urgent step to support nursing 
workers and strengthen our economy. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administration 
Policy in support of H.R. 3110. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3110—PUMP FOR NURSING MOTHERS ACT— 
REP. MALONEY, D–NY, AND 8 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 3110, the Providing Ur-
gent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act. No new mother should face 
unfair treatment in the workplace because 
their employer refuses to provide them with 
reasonable break time and private, clean 
space needed to adequately express breast 
milk while at work, forcing them to choose 
between their health and the health of her 
child, and earning a paycheck. Yet millions 
of new working mothers, disproportionately 
working mothers of color, face this challenge 
every day. 
Congress recognized the importance of en-
suring that workers are able to have the 
time and space they need to express breast 
milk by passing section 4207 of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, also 
known as the 2010 Break Time for Nursing 
Mothers Act. The PUMP for Nursing Moth-
ers Act would ensure that millions of work-
ing mothers previously excluded from the 
2010 Break Time law are protected. By clos-
ing this gap, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act will ensure millions of nursing mothers 
have a clear right to pump at work. Without 
these protections, nursing mothers face seri-
ous health consequences, including risk of 
painful illness and infection, diminished 
milk 
supply, 
or 
inability 
to 
continue 
breastfeeding. 
H.R. 3110 is a bipartisan bill that would 
also require employers to pay an hourly em-
ployee for any time spent pumping if the em-
ployee is also working. The legislation would 
ensure that nursing mothers have access to 
remedies available for other violations of the 
Fair Labor Standards Act. Finally, the 
PUMP Act also gives employers flexibility to 
identify solutions that work for their spe-
cific business environment. For example, the 
bill requires employees to inform their em-
ployers about inadequate space to express 
breast milk 10 days before filing suit for vio-
lating the requirement. 
The Administration encourages the House 
to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legisla-
tion and looks forward to working with the 
Congress to fill the gaps in the law so that 
all new mothers who choose to breastfeed are 
guaranteed the workplace protections they 
deserve. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge support of the legisla-
tion and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 3110. 
This act puts overly burdensome, 
one-size-fits-all requirements on busi-
nesses. 
While I believe empowering women in 
the workplace is important, we must 
not saddle businesses with rigid poli-
cies that will open them up to legal ac-
tion. We, instead, must support flexible 
policies that allow women to thrive in 
the workplace. 
This bill’s flawed scheme and expan-
sive mandate do more harm than good 
and will further bog down businesses 
that are already struggling to recover 
from the pandemic. During this dif-
ficult time, the last thing small busi-
nesses need is more sweeping man-
dates. 
More than 2 million women left the 
labor force in 2020. Now more than 
ever, we need to advocate for flexible 
workplace policies that improve condi-
tions for, and empower, working moth-
ers. 
I fully support women who wish to 
enter and return to the workforce, and 
I understand the challenges that can 
come with this, especially for nursing 
mothers. Yet, I don’t believe one-size- 
fits-all mandates are beneficial, not for 
women and not for employers. 
Workplaces are as varied as the peo-
ple they employ. Putting every work-
place under the same standard, despite 
a job creator’s needs or ability to meet 
that standard, will ultimately be bad 
for the American worker. 
Airlines are just one example of an 
industry that will be negatively im-
pacted if this bill is signed into law. 
Under this bill’s rigid requirements, 
airlines may have to rethink plane de-
signs or modify aircraft to provide a 
private space, other than a bathroom, 
for nursing mothers to pump, as re-
quired under the bill. 
The rigid break requirements in the 
bill are also inappropriate for airlines 
because flight crews have varying re-
sponsibilities in preparation for and 
throughout flights, which ensure the 
safety and security of passengers. 
Exposing airlines and other busi-
nesses to such inflexible requirements 
will hurt struggling businesses. 
Further, not all nursing mothers 
have the same needs. Pretending that 
they do might be convenient, but it 
also demonstrates ignorance about the 
diverse circumstances that mothers are 
in. 
I wholeheartedly believe that it is 
possible to provide women with a 
healthy environment in which to work 
and simultaneously to allow businesses 
flexibility in providing accommoda-
tions. 
When I first entered the workforce, 
nursing-accommodation 
requirements 
for women in the workplace were not 
even on the horizon. Countless work-
places now provide such accommoda-
tions, and rightly so. Current law pro-
vides accommodations for hourly work-
ers. 
Creating a healthy place for women 
to thrive is important to us all, but 
there is a right way to go about this 
and a wrong way. H.R. 3110 is the 
wrong way. 
Most employers have their employ-
ees’ best interests at heart, but H.R. 
3110 treats our job creators as if they 
are out to harm the very women they 
depend on to keep their businesses run-
ning. 
Again, this is the wrong way to go 
about empowering women in the work-
place. 
This bill’s excessive penalties, expan-
sive mandate, and lack of clarity will 
create a perfect storm for frivolous 
lawsuits. Unfounded lawsuits cost busi-
nesses billions every year in the United 
States. We should do all we can to pre-
vent opening businesses up to harmful 
legal action. 
I would like to remind my colleagues 
that 
Representative 
MILLER-MEEKS 
submitted her bill, the Supporting 
Working Mothers Act, to the Rules 
Committee as an amendment to pro-
vide a commonsense alternative to the 
PUMP Act. 
That is a sensible amendment that 
meets the actual needs of nursing 
mothers without forcing overly burden-
some regulations on our job creators. 
That amendment, unlike the PUMP 
Act, expands access to nursing accom-
modations in the workplace without

relying on punitive mandates that ex-
pose businessowners to costly litiga-
tion. 
The Supporting Working Mothers 
Act adds nursing-accommodation cov-
erage for white collar executive, ad-
ministrative, or professional employ-
ees, ensuring that over 80 percent of 
currently exempt women are covered. 
That amendment also includes a fair 
and workable process to ensure accom-
modations are provided for nursing 
mothers by encouraging collaboration 
between workers and employers to 
identify and make improvements when 
accommodations are insufficient. 
Representative MILLER-MEEKS’ com-
monsense amendment serves nursing 
mothers in the workforce without sac-
rificing the well-being of our job cre-
ators. This is the right way to empower 
women. 
I am extremely disappointed that the 
Democrat majority refused to make 
the amendment in order. Democrats 
chose to stifle debate on this common-
sense approach to nursing accommoda-
tions in favor of a flawed mandate. 
Because the bill is impractical and 
overly punitive, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3110. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY), chair of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee and the 
lead Democratic sponsor of the bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his in-
credible leadership in this body. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3110, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act, a bipartisan bill I authored with 
Representative HERRERA BEUTLER. Our 
bill has also been introduced in the 
Senate by Senators MERKLEY and MUR-
KOWSKI. 
When I first came to Congress, work-
ing mothers would come to me, often 
in tears, and advocate for a place to 
safely pump breast milk. Often, they 
were fired, ridiculed, forbidden, or 
forced to pump milk in bathrooms. 
Since those years, I have worked for 
on-site lactation rooms, here in gov-
ernment and really everywhere in our 
country. 
In 1998, I passed a provision allowing 
State WIC agencies to purchase breast 
pumps for new mothers, making it 
easier for low-income moms to choose 
breastfeeding. 
In 1999, Congress passed my bill to 
guarantee the right to breastfeed on 
Federal property. 
Most recently, Senator MERKLEY and 
I passed the Break Time for Nursing 
Mothers as part of the Affordable Care 
Act. This act provides employees with 
critical protections to provide break 
time for nursing mothers and a private 
place to pump milk. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
we are considering today builds on the 
Break Time Act by protecting the 
nearly 9 million employees who were 
not originally included in these protec-
tions. Those covered by the PUMP for 
Nursing 
Mothers 
Act 
now 
include 
teachers, 
nurses, 
farmworkers, 
and 
software engineers, to name a few. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
would also ensure that nursing moth-
ers have remedies if their employers 
fire them or violate these breastfeeding 
protections. In addition, if an employee 
is fired for taking a break, the PUMP 
Act ensures that workers can seek re-
instatement. 
It also extends breastfeeding protec-
tions for 2 years, in line with rec-
ommendations from the World Health 
Organization. 
Over 150 organizations have endorsed 
this important legislation. I include in 
the RECORD
letters of support from 
some of those organizations, including 
the Center for WorkLife Law, and 
MomsRising, to name a few. 
WRITTEN
STATEMENT
OF
THE
CENTER
FOR 
WORKLIFE LAW BEFORE THE UNITED STATES 
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES—SEPTEMBER 
24, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The Center for WorkLife 
Law submits this letter to the U.S. House of 
Representatives in full support of the Pro-
viding Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) 
for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). 
The Center for WorkLife Law is a research 
and advocacy organization that seeks to ad-
vance gender, racial, and class equity in em-
ployment and education. We collaborate 
with employees, employers, attorneys, and 
government officials to identify practical 
and legal solutions to work-family issues. 
WorkLife Law’s 2019 report Exposed: Dis-
crimination Against Breastfeeding Workers 
found that shortcomings of the existing 
Break Time for Nursing Mothers law have 
caused lactating employees to face signifi-
cant obstacles at work. Even with the cur-
rent law’s protections, breastfeeding employ-
ees leaking milk have been denied permis-
sion to take pumping breaks; they have been 
fired just for asking; and refused privacy, 
forcing them to pump milk with their 
breasts exposed to coworkers, clients, and 
the public in physically unsafe conditions. 
Employees who do not receive the break 
time and private space they need can face se-
rious health consequences, including illness 
and painful infections, diminished milk sup-
ply, and weaning earlier than doctors rec-
ommend. Many employees also suffer eco-
nomic losses when they are fired or forced to 
resign following a request for lactation ac-
commodations. 
The PUMP Act would correct key short-
comings of existing law that undermine the 
economic security and health of women and 
their families. 
CLOSING THE COVERAGE GAP THAT EXCLUDES 
MILLIONS OF WORKERS 
Nearly 9 million women of childbearing 
age are currently excluded from the protec-
tions of the Break Time for Nursing Mothers 
Law, meaning they have no clear federal 
right to receive break time and private space 
to pump milk during the workday. This ex-
clusion was unintentional at the time the 
law was enacted. The resulting coverage gap 
is considerable and impacts employees in a 
wide range of occupations, including many of 
those working in the top two pink-collar oc-
cupations: nursing and teaching. The PUMP 
Act would correct this senseless exclusion to 
bring all workers whose employers are cov-
ered by the FLSA under the law’s protection. 
PROVIDING APPROPRIATE REMEDIES TO 
ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE 
Even when clear violations occur, the 
Break Time for Nursing Mothers provision 
cannot be counted on to deliver appropriate 
remedies in a court of law. Because employ-
ers cannot be held accountable for inten-
tional legal violations, noncompliance has 
been widespread. As one judge expressed in 
the case of an EMT who was fired simply for 
asking that she be given break time and 
space: ‘‘While the Court is sympathetic to 
Plaintiff’s argument that this renders [the 
Nursing Mothers law] ineffective, there is no 
support from the case law or DOL [Depart-
ment of Labor]’’ to provide a remedy. An-
other federal judge observed: ‘‘An employer 
faced with a request to allow an employee to 
take breaks to breastfeed may simply fire 
the employee rather than attempt to accom-
modate the request for breaks. And indeed, 
the Center for WorkLife Law has heard from 
too many workers whose employers have 
done exactly that. 
The PUMP Act would correct this absurd-
ity and encourage employers to follow the 
law by making remedies that are already 
available in other employment law contexts 
equally available to breastfeeding workers. 
However, the PUMP Act is not expected to 
lead to a significant increase in lawsuits. A 
recent analysis by the Center for WorkLife 
Law found that while enforceable laws in-
crease breastfeeding rates, they do not cause 
a meaningful increase in litigation rates. 
The study reviewed all cases filed in each 
state with enforceable lactation break time 
and space laws (similar to the PUMP Act) 
through 2020 and found: 
Litigation rates for violations of the state 
laws were extremely low. Over the combined 
forty-seven years that the four jurisdictions’ 
break time and space laws have been in ef-
fect, there were only six (6) cases total. 
The annual likeihood a private employer 
will be sued under a break time and space 
law is essentially zero (0.0002 percent). A 
business owner is over 25 times more likely 
to be struck by lightning in their lifetime. 
Notably, the state laws WorkLife Law 
studied do not include the additional em-
ployer protection found in the PUMP Act 
that gives businesses 10 days to correct space 
violations before any lawsuit can be filed, a 
provision that will further decrease the num-
ber of lawsuits that would be filed should the 
PUMP Act pass. 
The PUMP Act is a balanced approach that 
meets the needs of breastfeeding employees 
while also serving employers who make rea-
sonable attempts to follow the law. When 
employers have clear standards to meet, and 
appropriate consequences if they don’t, em-
ployers have shown that they are able to pro-
vide the break time and space that working 
mothers need. Complying with break time 
and space requirements is simple, and cre-
ative solutions exist in all industries. As de-
scribed by the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, employers that support 
breastfeeding with affordable solutions real-
ize cost savings from increased loyalty and 
retention, reduced sick time, and decreased 
health care and insurance costs. 
Our organization urges all members of 
Congress to vote in support because the 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act would ensure 
that all breastfeeding women have the full 
protection of the law and ability to meet 
their basic needs while away from their nurs-
ing babies during the workday. It is a simple 
solution that promotes maternal and child 
health, as well as the economic security of 
women and families.

RECTOR, MOMRISING
BEFORE
THE
UNITED 
STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES—SEP-
TEMBER 24, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: MomsRising submits this 
letter to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in full support of the Providing Urgent Ma-
ternal 
Protections 
(PUMP) 
for 
Nursing 
Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). 
MomsRising is a national online and on- 
the-ground 
grassroots 
organization 
with 
more than a million members nationwide. 
We work on a broad range of issues and poli-
cies to achieve economic security for all 
moms, women, and families in the United 
States. 
While nearly four out of five U.S. mothers 
start out breastfeeding, less than half are 
still breastfeeding at six months postpartum. 
One of the main causes for the drop-off in 
breastfeeding rates is the lack of break time 
and a private place to pump in the work-
place. MomsRising members around the 
country have shared their stories and pic-
tures about needing better places to pump 
breastmilk. 
Currently, federal law requires employers 
for most hourly wage-earning and some sala-
ried employees (nonexempt workers) reason-
able break time and a private, non-bathroom 
location to express breast milk for one year 
after the child’s birth, This is a great first 
step, but it leaves millions of workers with-
out any protections at all. We must close the 
gap in the law and expand protections for all 
breastfeeding mothers who work outside of 
the home. The PUMP Act will close gaps and 
include meaningful enforcement. 
Breastfeeding isn’t just good for moms and 
babies. The fact is that breastfeeding is good 
for the physical and economic health of our 
nation. Recent studies have shown if moth-
ers could meet current medical recommenda-
tions for breastfeeding it would save the US 
economy nearly $13 billion per year in 
paediatric 
health 
costs 
and 
premature 
deaths. 
With three-quarters of moms being the pri-
mary or co-breadwinner these days, we must 
close the gap in existing law and expand pro-
tections for all breastfeeding mothers who 
work outside of the home. Sadly returning to 
work is too often a significant barrier to 
breastfeeding, but we can do better. 
Please support all breastfeeding and work-
ing moms and support the PUMP Act. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
KRISTIN ROWE-FINKBEINER, 
Co-Founder & Executive Director, 
MomRising. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. As these organizations have 
demonstrated, without these protec-
tions, nursing mothers face serious 
health consequences, including the risk 
of painful illness and the inability to 
continue to breastfeed. 
Studies have shown the health bene-
fits for breastfed infants. It is really 
important and can prevent other dis-
eases. 
These basic protections would ensure 
that working moms who want to 
breastfeed can continue to do so and 
prevent nursing mothers from being 
singled out, ridiculed, or fired. 
This bill is an important step for 
work-family balance. We say we sup-
port families. Today is a vote for fami-
lies, work-family balance, and mothers 
and infants. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong 
‘‘yes’’ bipartisan vote.

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Dr. FOXX for yielding 
me time to speak on this important 
issue. 
As a mother and a physician, I under-
stand the tremendous value that nurs-
ing an infant brings both to the mother 
and the child. 
As the director of the Iowa Depart-
ment of Public Health, I attended con-
ferences and spoke on the need to en-
courage 
mothers 
to 
consider 
breastfeeding 
and 
the 
benefits 
of 
breastfeeding, 
be 
they 
nutritional, 
immunological, 
or 
the 
tremendous 
bond 
that 
occurs 
through 
breastfeeding. 
It is also why, despite being a work-
ing mother who was doing a general 
surgery internship and ophthalmology 
residency, I breast-fed both of my chil-
dren. Because I was a working mother, 
that included expressing breast milk 
by pumping. 
I understand and I am supportive of 
the collaboration between employers 
and nursing mothers to have a private 
place to do so at their place of employ-
ment. I recognize that H.R. 3110 is try-
ing to address this issue and provide 
accommodations for nursing mothers, 
which I wholeheartedly support, how-
ever, I feel the bill needs improvement. 
As it stands, H.R. 3110 puts a one- 
size-fits-all treatment of nursing ac-
commodations for different businesses 
and industries. The bill also puts exces-
sive penalties for minor or technical 
violations of the nursing-accommoda-
tion requirements in the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
These unreasonable penalties, com-
bined 
with 
compliance 
challenges 
posed by the mandate, will lead to 
costly and protracted lawsuits because 
of their adversarial nature. 
The result will be delayed accom-
modations for working mothers. Rath-
er than a collaborative arrangement 
between an employer and a nursing 
mother employee, this bill is punitive 
in nature. 
To address laws and H.R. 3110 and 
build on current law protections for 
nursing mothers, I submitted my bill, 
H.R. 4297, the Supporting Working 
Mothers Act, to the Rules Committee 
as an amendment. 
My bill is based on legislation intro-
duced in a previous Congress by the 
sponsor of the bill we are debating 
today. Unfortunately, the majority re-
fused to allow my amendment to even 
be debated on the floor. 
My amendment represents a work-
able, feasible, and reasonable approach 
to the Fair Labor Standards Act nurs-
ing-accommodation requirements. 
First, my amendment would have 
modified current law by providing cov-
erage to white collar executive, admin-
istrative, and professional employees, 
while also maintaining current law 
coverage of hourly employees. My bill 
also preserved the 50-employee undue 
hardship exemption threshold as a safe-
guard for small businesses. 
These provisions would ensure cov-
erage for over 80 percent of the women 
who are not currently covered by the 
Fair Labor Standards Act nursing-ac-
commodation requirement. 
The bill we are debating today, H.R. 
3110, significantly increases the pen-
alties for employer violations that are 
required for breastfeeding accommoda-
tions, regardless of attempts at compli-
ance. 
These penalties are disproportionate 
to the technical and unintentional Fair 
Labor Standards Act violations which 
could occur under this bill. 
My amendment would have preserved 
the authority of the Secretary of Labor 
to provide injunctive relief to address 
shortcomings and accommodations and 
assessable monetary penalties for re-
peat violations. 
However—and this is critical—my 
amendment also includes a provision 
establishing a collaborative process for 
employees and employers to create and 
improve accommodations in a timely 
fashion without relying on time con-
suming and expensive lawsuits. 
Because workplaces are not one size 
fits all, it is critical that legislation on 
nursing accommodations provide clear 
requirements that are adaptable to 
many kinds of workplaces, so that em-
ployers understand their obligations 
and are able to comply. 
Again, given my strong support of 
breastfeeding, pumping, and storing of 
breast milk, I am very disappointed 
that my amendment was not ruled in 
order by the majority and that Con-
gress did not take this opportunity to 
address the flaws in H.R. 3110. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington State (Ms. 
HERRERA BEUTLER), the co-chair of the 
Maternity Care Caucus and the lead 
Republican sponsor on the bill. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of our 
bipartisan bill, the PUMP for Nursing 
Mothers Act. 
Honestly, the whole goal of this leg-
islation is to protect a nursing moth-
er’s ability to provide for her infant by 
pumping at work. 
And let me be clear, this is a busi-
ness-friendly bill. This is current law. 
For those who are thinking we are 
shaking the Earth and doing something 
brand-new, it actually is current law. 
There were problems with the way the 
current law was written; it was actu-
ally put in the wrong place in code, and 
we are fixing that. 
So the way it is currently, you could 
be a mom who gets into working and

you have worked your way up into a 
career where you are salaried and you 
make a decent amount of money, but 
you were excluded from this legisla-
tion. You didn’t have the right to ex-
pect this, even though other workers 
did. 
We are simply making some of those 
changes to make sure that folks who 
were not eligible for overtime, like 
that working mom, would be covered 
under current law. 
This bill gives businesses clarity and 
predictability and allows small busi-
nesses to claim undue hardship exemp-
tions in recognition of the unique chal-
lenges that they face. 
Making sure our economy works is a 
huge priority to me, but we have to 
also recognize that working moms 
make up a significant portion—and 
should—of the workforce, and it is 
going to grow. 
I thank my colleagues for improving 
this bill to reflect its original intent 
with regard to businesses, namely, dif-
ferentiating between large corpora-
tions and mom-and-pop operations. 
As a mom of three young kids my-
self, I understand finding the balance 
of raising kids, going to work, and just 
simply finding a place to pump while 
working. 
My first child was a 28-week preemie. 
It was imperative for her to have 
breast milk; we were told this by her 
doctors. She could not handle formula, 
and they said it is imperative that you 
do what you can to breastfeed her. And 
I joke I am going to write a book 
called, Oh, the places I have pumped. I 
have pumped in trains, on planes, in 
automobiles, in some poor low-ranking 
officer’s office at the Pentagon, at a 
kibbutz in Israel on a codel; I mean, ev-
erywhere. And I can tell you, there are 
places that are clean and helpful, and 
it doesn’t have to be like the Taj 
Mahal; you just need something that is 
not crammed in a public toilet where 
people are flushing over you. 
So on a really serious note, this is a 
critical piece of legislation that is 
going to empower women in the work-
force to continue to provide for their 
families. 
Imagine a single mother not having 
that choice, she has to work, and 
maybe she wants to provide breast 
milk for her child or maybe she has to 
in a circumstance like mine. Making 
sure that mothers of infants and tod-
dlers can continue to do this in the 
workforce and continue to join the 
workforce is absolutely vital. 
With women making up over half of 
our Nation’s workforce, it is crucial 
that moms aren’t forced to choose be-
tween 
going 
to 
their 
job 
or 
breastfeeding their child. 
With the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce’s endorsement of this legisla-
tion, this bill seeks to help, not hinder, 
an employer’s ability to provide a safe 
space for moms to pump. 
I am proud to help lead this bipar-
tisan legislation with my colleague, 
Congresswoman MALONEY, so moms in 
southwest Washington and across this 
country can feel secure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD). The time of the gen-
tlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Washington. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD let-
ters of support from the United States 
Chamber of Commerce and the Na-
tional Retail Federation. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, September 28, 2021. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVE: The U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce strongly supports H.R. 3110, the Pro-
viding Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) 
for Nursing Mothers Act, as reported from 
the Education and Labor Committee and as 
anticipated to be be improved via manager’s 
amendment. We hope this legislation will be 
further refined as the legislative process con-
tinues to address the unique issues related to 
the air travel sector. 
This legislation would update the Break 
Time for Nursing Mothers Act, which be-
came law in 2010. This law amended the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to require em-
ployers with more than 50 employees to pro-
vide a space for mothers to either nurse or, 
more likely, to express breast milk. It also 
requires employers to provide reasonable 
breaks for workers to nurse. Because the leg-
islation amended the FLSA’s overtime provi-
sion, it did not cover workers exempt from 
overtime. It also lacks an enforcement 
mechanism. 
The PUMP Act would expand coverage to 
those workers currently exempt and would 
provide workers with a remedy if employers 
fail to provide accommodation or reasonable 
breaks. The bill as passed by the Education 
and Labor Committee and the manager’s 
amendment would improve upon the intro-
duced version of H.R. 3110 in several key 
areas: 
Employers would be allowed 10 days to im-
prove space allocated for nursing mothers 
before employees could proceed with seeking 
relief from the courts. This provision would 
assure that more employees can get the ac-
commodations they need in a timely manner 
rather than triggering a drawn out, costly, 
and uncertain litigation process. 
Department of Labor would be required to 
issue guidance that is consistent with the ex-
isting information from the Office on Wom-
en’s Health of the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ website in order to assist 
employers with compliance. 
The number of employees necessary for 
employers to be eligible for the hardship ex-
emption would be made consistent with 
other provisions of law. 
This legislation should be improved to pro-
vide a reasonable exemption for the air trav-
el sector. The limitations on space on air-
planes would make compliance with this leg-
islation impractical and in some cases im-
possible. We hope this issue is addressed as 
the bill makes its way through the legisla-
tive process. 
The PUMP Act is a win-win for nursing 
mothers and the companies that employ 
them. Employers would get clarity and a 
way to avoid litigation, and nursing mothers 
would be able to remain in the workforce. 
The bill as reported by the Education and 
Labor Committee and augmented by the 
manager’s amendment is the product of col-
laborative negotiations between employers 
and advocates for this bill. The Chamber is 
pleased to strongly support this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
NEIL L. BRADLEY. 
NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION, 
Washington, DC, October 12, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: On behalf of the Na-
tional Retail Federation, I write to express 
our support for and urge the passage of H.R. 
3110, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protec-
tions for Nursing Mothers (PUMP) Act. 
NRF, the world’s largest retail trade asso-
ciation, passionately advocates for the peo-
ple, brands, policies and ideas that help re-
tail thrive. From its headquarters in Wash-
ington, D.C., NRF empowers the industry 
that powers the economy. Retail is the na-
tion’s largest private-sector employer, con-
tributing $3.9 trillion to annual GDP and 
supporting one in four U.S. jobs—52 million 
working Americans. For over a century, 
NRF has been a voice for every retailer and 
every retail job, educating, inspiring and 
communicating the powerful impact retail 
has on local communities and global econo-
mies. 
For over a decade, federal law has required 
employers to provide nursing mothers with 
reasonable break times to express breast 
milk. Further, employers must designate a 
facility in which to do so, that is shielded 
from view and ‘‘free from intrusion from co-
workers and the public.’’ As enacted, only 
nursing mothers who are non-exempt from 
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) were 
covered by the new requirements. The PUMP 
Act would expand coverage to all nursing 
mothers. This legislation also includes im-
portant provisions that will ensure that em-
ployers are properly notified if it is alleged 
that they are not providing appropriate fa-
cilities for nursing, including a 10-calendar- 
day time period for employers to provide 
such facilities before any litigation can com-
mence. 
The PUMP Act is a sound piece of bipar-
tisan legislation that will allow nursing 
mothers to maintain their vital role the 
American workplace. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID FRENCH, 
Senior Vice President Government Relations. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Person Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished ranking 
member from North Carolina for yield-
ing. 
Person Speaker, I rise in strong oppo-
sition to the PUMP for Nursing Moth-
ers Act, or should I call it the pump for 
nursing persons act? I can’t keep up 
with the rules of this House. 
At a time, Person Speaker, when we 
have 10 million job openings, why does 
the Democrat majority have such con-
tempt and disdain for struggling busi-
nesses, job creators, and employers? 
With businesses already suffering 
from endless regulations and the re-
sulting costs passed on to consumers, 
not to mention being saddled with the 
vaccine mandates, endless COVID re-
strictions, why are Democrats relent-
lessly consumed with making things 
worse?

The fact is, Democrats are economi-
cally illiterate. They don’t understand 
that the government doesn’t have any 
money, they can only take it from tax-
payers, and businesses don’t truly pay 
taxes or pay for regulations. They have 
two choices: Close or pass on those 
costs to consumers. 
Democrats believe that employers 
are abusing and exploiting their work-
ers, and Democrats are working every 
day to punish them, with the result 
being more lost jobs, greater supply 
shortages, and higher inflation as we 
see around our country today. 
We all believe in an equal workplace 
for men and women, but I oppose legis-
lation that falsely victimizes employ-
ees and is truly just another payout for 
trial lawyers, otherwise known as 
Democrat donors. They are seeking to 
exploit these excessive new penalties 
on businesses. 
The fact is employers want happy 
and productive employees. They are 
working hard to attract and retain 
those workers. And they are already 
making these accommodations without 
the heavy hand of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
I encourage my colleagues across the 
aisle to visit a business or talk to an 
employer. 
This regulation was written by trial 
lawyers, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ and I will be doing the 
same. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD), the co-chair of the Black Mater-
nal Health Caucus. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
every mom returning to the workforce 
after childbirth should be provided the 
time and space that they need to safely 
and privately pump breast milk at 
work. 
As a nurse, I understand how critical 
breastfeeding is to the health of both 
mom and baby. 
Without sufficient workplace protec-
tions, breastfeeding employees are at 
risk of serious and painful health con-
sequences and reduced milk supply. 
They can also face harassment, docked 
pay, and even job loss. 
Yet each year, millions of workers, 
including 
teachers, 
nurses, 
farm-
workers, and salaried employees are 
denied this basic protection due to an 
unintended loophole in current law. 
I am grateful to Chairwoman MALO-
NEY for her leadership, and I am proud 
to join her in leading the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act to close the cov-
erage gap and ensure all breastfeeding 
moms are protected and supported as 
they return to work. 
This bill is bipartisan and has a 
broad coalition of support from public 
health, labor, and civil rights groups, 
as well as from the business commu-
nity. 
It is also urgently needed, providing 
commonsense, necessary protections 
for working moms, as well as more 
clarity and predictability for employ-
ers. 
Returning to work after childbirth 
already poses many inherent chal-
lenges for moms and their families, and 
we must remove barriers for parents 
making the best choices for their fami-
lies and themselves. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD three letters in support of the 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act from 
the National Education Association, 
the National Partnership for Women 
and Families, and the March of Dimes. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, September 24, 2021. 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The 3 million mem-
bers of the National Education Association, 
who educate and support 50 million students 
across the nation, urge you to vote YES on 
the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections 
(PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act, H.R. 3110. 
Votes on this issue may be included in the 
NEA Report Card for the 117th Congress. 
The 2010 Break Time law provided impor-
tant protections that ensured employees 
would have reasonable break time and a pri-
vate place to pump breast milk. However, 
the law excludes certain categories of em-
ployees, including educators; in fact, nearly 
one in four women of childbearing age is not 
covered by the Break Time law. The PUMP 
Act would: 
Protect the nearly 9 million employees 
who are not now covered by the Break Time 
law; 
Require employers to provide reasonable 
break time and a private, non-bathroom 
space for breastfeeding employees to pump 
during the workday; 
Provide employers with clarity on when 
pumping time must be paid and when it may 
be unpaid, leaving in place existing law pro-
tecting many salaried workers and clarifying 
that any time spent pumping while the em-
ployee is working must be counted as hours 
worked; and 
Ensure that nursing mothers have access 
to remedies that are available for other vio-
lations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
Decades of scientific research tell us that 
breastfeeding helps put children on the path 
to life-long health and wellness. This strong 
foundation, in turn, can pave the way for 
their future success in school. The PUMP 
Act supports children’s early development, 
while also recognizing that breastfeeding 
mothers are crucial breadwinners for their 
families. We urge you to vote YES on the 
PUMP Act.

MARC EGAN, 
Director of Government Relations, 
National Education Association.

DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: The National 
Partnership for Women & Families is a non- 
profit, non-partisan advocacy organization 
committed to improving the lives of women 
and families by achieving equity for all 
women. Since our creation as the Women’s 
Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have fought 
for every significant advance for equal op-
portunity in the workplace, including the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and 
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 
(FMLA). We write in strong support of H.R. 
3110, Providing Urgent Maternal Protections 
(PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act. This bipar-
tisan legislation will support breastfeeding 
employees and their families, improving in-
fant health and the economic security of 
women and families. 
Once pregnant workers return to the work-
place after giving birth, many will need the 
ability to pump breastmilk during the work-
day. While the Affordable Care Act requires 
employers to provide reasonable break time 
and a private, non-bathroom space for cer-
tain breastfeeding employees to pump, per-
sistent coverage gaps exist. Roughly one in 
four women of childbearing age are not cov-
ered by current law. Since breastfeeding is 
associated with a host of improved health 
outcomes, expanding these protections to 
the 9 million workers currently excluded 
from the Break Time for Nursing Mothers 
law is essential to support mothers in the 
workplace. In addition to closing the cov-
erage gap, the PUMP Act will also clarify for 
employers when pumping time must be paid 
and when it may be unpaid, and extend the 
remedies available for other violations of the 
Fair Labor Standards Act to nursing em-
ployees, ensuring that working parents’ 
rights are protected. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act is cru-
cial because it will fill the gaps in the Break 
Time for Nursing Mothers law, allowing 
breastfeeding employees to remain in the 
workforce 
while 
keeping 
their 
families 
healthy. It is time to clarify and strengthen 
existing federal protections for breastfeeding 
employees by passing the PUMP for Nursing 
Mothers Act. 
Sincerely, 
DEBRA L. NESS, 
President, National Partnership 
for Women & Families. 
MARCH OF DIMES, 
September 24, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,

Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER MCCARTHY, 
LEADER SCHUMER
AND LEADER MCCONNELL: 
On behalf of March of Dimes, the nonprofit 
organization leading the fight for the health 
of all moms and babies, we urge swift pas-
sage of the bi-partisan Providing Urgent Ma-
ternal 
Protections 
(PUMP) 
for 
Nursing 
Mothers Act (S. 1658/H.R. 3110). 
We began that fight more than 80 years ago 
as an organization dedicated to eradicating 
polio in the U.S., a goal that we achieved. We 
continue that fight today as we work to ad-
dress some of the biggest threats to moms 
and babies, such as premature birth and ma-
ternal mortality, through research, edu-
cation, programs and advocacy. 
March of Dimes’ ongoing work to improve 
maternal and infant health is more impor-
tant than ever as our nation is in the midst 
of a dire maternal and infant health crisis. 
Rates of preterm birth are increasing, the 
U.S. is one of the most dangerous places to 
give birth in the developed world, and there 
are unacceptable disparities in birth out-
comes between women and infants of color 
and their White peers. We also know, the 
health and well-being of mothers and infants 
are inextricably linked. By improving the 
health of, and conditions for, women before, 
during and between pregnancies, we can im-
prove outcomes for both them and their in-
fants. But we have many challenges before 
us. 
One of those challenges is ensuring the 
ability for a mother to feed her infant after 
returning to the workplace. When a new 
mother returns to work after having a baby,

she will need continued support in the work-
place 
to 
ensure 
she 
can 
continue 
to 
breastfeed her child if she chooses. Exclusive 
breastfeeding has a significant impact the 
health of the baby, as well as benefits for 
moms. However, returning to work can make 
continuing the breastfeeding relationship be-
tween mothers and their infants very dif-
ficult, especially if employers don’t provide 
employees with adequate break time and an 
appropriate space to express breastmilk dur-
ing the workday. 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included 
provisions that required certain employers 
to provide break time and a place for most 
hourly wage-earning and some salaried em-
ployee to pump at work. The Providing Ur-
gent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act would extend those supports 
to the 9 million employees that were ex-
cluded from the ACA’s protections and pro-
vide for enforcement of this benefit. These 
nurses, teachers, retail workers, and man-
agers across a number of industries deserve 
the same protections as other working moth-
ers. March of Dimes proudly endorses the 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (S. 1658/H.R. 
3110). 
Thank you again for the opportunity to ex-
press March of Dimes’ strong support for this 
bipartisan legislation under consideration, 
the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (S. 1658/ 
H.R. 3110). We urge the swift advancement of 
this important bill and look forward to its 
passage. 
Sincerely, 
STACEY BRAYBOY, 
Senior Vice President, Public Policy 
& Government Affairs. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank these groups for their support of 
the bill and for their tireless efforts on 
behalf of working moms. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 3110, the PUMP Act. 
Americans want nursing mothers to 
have adequate provisions in the work-
place. The fact is, they are already pro-
vided in the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
The bill before us consists of unrea-
sonable burdens on employers and pen-
alties that will end up disincentivizing 
job creation. 
At the same time that nursing moth-
ers deserve protections, employers de-
serve allowances for flexibility in their 
workplace. 
We are in the midst of an economic, 
supply chain, and employment crisis. 
We don’t need to put more hurdles in 
the way of businesses and employment. 
When I am in my district and I speak 
to business owners all around my dis-
trict, the number one thing I hear is we 
cannot find enough workers. Why are 
we going to put more strain on them? 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD), the co-chair of the Ma-
ternity Care Caucus. 
Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the PUMP 
Act to expand workplace protections 
for breastfeeding moms and ensure 
they have access to appropriate and 
necessary accommodations. 
Decades of research have shown that 
breastfeeding is one of the most cost- 
effective interventions for improving 
maternal and child health. 
Compared with formula-fed children, 
breastfed babies have a reduced risk of 
ear, skin, stomach, and respiratory in-
fections, sudden infant death syn-
drome, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, 
asthma, and childhood leukemia. 
However, while 84 percent of U.S. ba-
bies are breastfed at birth, only 25 per-
cent are still exclusively breastfed at 6 
months of age. 
I commend my colleague, CAROLYN 
MALONEY, for her career-long dedica-
tion to improving these breastfeeding 
statistics. 
Congresswoman 
MALONEY’s 
2010 
Break Time for Nursing Mothers law 
provided the first critical protections 
to ensure mothers would have reason-
able break times and a private place to 
pump breast milk. 
b 0945 
Mothers with this access to work-
place support have lower healthcare 
costs, absenteeism, and turnover and 
show improved job morale, satisfac-
tion, and productivity. 
However, that law unintentionally 
excluded 9 million women from these 
workplace 
protections, 
including 
teachers, software engineers, and many 
nurses. 
Expanding workplace protections to 
include these women is important be-
cause research clearly shows that with-
out protections, breastfeeding employ-
ees have increased risk of painful ill-
ness and infection, diminished milk 
supply, and are more likely to stop 
breastfeeding early. 
As cochair of both the Maternity 
Care Caucus and the Public Health 
Caucus, I am proud to be an original 
cosponsor of the PUMP Act, which is a 
commonsense solution to eliminating 
workplace barriers that interfere with 
successful breastfeeding. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
is critical to ensuring all mothers have 
the opportunity to reach their personal 
breastfeeding goals to protect their ba-
bies, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter of support from the 
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 
WRITTEN STATEMENT OF THE ACADEMY OF NU-
TRITION AND DIETETICS BEFORE THE UNITED 
STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SEP-
TEMBER 27, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The Academy of Nutrition 
and Dietetics submits this letter to the U.S. 
House of Representatives in full support of 
the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections 
(PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). 
Representing 
more 
than 
112,000 
credentialed nutrition and dietetics practi-
tioners, the Academy of Nutrition and Di-
etetics is the world’s largest organization of 
food and nutrition professionals. The Acad-
emy is committed to improving the nation’s 
health and advancing the profession of di-
etetics through research, education and ad-
vocacy. Our vision is a world where all peo-
ple thrive through the transformative power 
of food and nutrition. Our mission is to ac-
celerate improvements in global health and 
well-being through food and nutrition. 
The Academy’s impact goals include in-
creasing equitable access to food, nutrition 
and other life-style related services. As an 
organization that is overwhelmingly com-
posed of women in the workforce, the strug-
gle to balance professional responsibilities 
and motherhood is well-known to our mem-
bers 
as 
is 
the 
nutritional 
case 
for 
breastfeeding and its continuance despite re-
turning to work. Thus, for the Academy, the 
issue 
of 
workplace 
accommodations for 
breastfeeding women is both personal to our 
members and their health and professional 
given the unquestionably essential role of 
human milk in early nutrition for infants. 
For over a decade—truly since the passage 
of the Affordable Care Act—the Academy has 
advocated for legislation addressing work-
place accommodations for mothers doing 
their best to meet the demands of earning a 
wage, caring for their infants and protecting 
their own health but who work for employers 
not included in existing law. 
Women choosing to continue breastfeeding 
after returning to work should be supported 
in this very personal yet consequential deci-
sion that carries life-long outcomes for both 
mom and infant. 
It is unfortunate that such an important 
decision is often not supported or understood 
by employers who benefit directly. In one 
study, only 40 percent of mothers reported 
having access to both break time and a pri-
vate space to pump while on the job. There 
is also inconsistency regarding how employ-
ers meet legal requirements to accommodate 
breastfeeding workers, even for those cur-
rently covered by the law. As shared in the 
media, stories from women employees report 
janitorial and other closets as the designated 
pumping location and reveal barriers faced 
by moms requesting an unpaid break. 
A key recommendation of the 2020–2025 Di-
etary Guidelines for Americans is, ‘‘For 
about the first 6 months of life, exclusively 
feed infants human milk. Sadly, among 
women who work full-time, only 10% of 
those who started breastfeeding their babies 
will still be breastfeeding by the time their 
infant reaches six-month of age. The antici-
pation and apprehension associated with how 
to continue to breastfeed after returning to 
work prevents some moms from even initi-
ating breastfeeding. 
There are three key reasons that Congress 
should pass the PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act: 1) Human milk offers superior nutrition 
and health benefits compared to infant for-
mula, 
2) 
employers 
benefit 
from 
breastfeeding moms who return to work and 
3) increasing breastfeeding initiation and du-
ration are public health priorities of the 
United States. Examining the rationale more 
closely demonstrates the positive outcomes 
expected with passage of the bill. 
1. Human Milk Offers Superior Nutrition and 
Health Benefits Compared to Infant For-
mula 
The Academy has previously noted that 
‘‘. . . exclusive breastfeeding provides opti-
mal nutrition and health protection for the 
first 6 months of life and breastfeeding with 
complementary foods from 6 months until at 
least 12 months of age is the ideal feeding 
pattern for infants. Breastfeeding is an im-
portant public health strategy for improving 
infant and child morbidity and mortality, 
improving maternal morbidity, and helping 
to control health care costs. Breastfeeding is 
associated with a reduced risk of otitis 
media, gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, 
sudden infant death syndrome, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, 
obesity, 
and 
hypertension. 
Breastfeeding is also associated with im-
proved maternal outcomes, including a re-
duced risk of breast and ovarian cancer, type

2 diabetes, and postpartum depression. These 
reductions in acute and chronic illness help 
to decrease health care related expenses and 
productive time lost from work. 
2. Employers Benefit from Breastfeeding 
Moms Who Return to Work 
Aside from nutrition and the health bene-
fits to the mother and baby, employers gain 
from women who continue to breastfeed 
after returning to work. First, breastfeeding 
employees miss work less often. One-day ab-
sences to care for a sick infant or child hap-
pen twice as often for mothers who chose to 
feed their infants formula. Second, since 
breastfeeding is associated with lower health 
care costs for mother and baby, employers 
also benefit from lower medical insurance 
claims. One insurance company, CIGNA, 
found that 343 employees participating in a 
worksite lactation support program resulted 
in an annual savings of $240,000 in health 
care expenses, 62 percent fewer prescriptions 
and $60,000 savings related to absenteeism 
rates over a two-year period. Finally, for 
businesses that offer a worksite lactation 
program, there are even greater tangible 
benefits to the employer. These include 
lower turnover rates and absenteeism for 
working women, fathers and partners; addi-
tional health care savings; higher produc-
tivity and loyalty; as well as a positive pub-
lic image. 
3. Increasing Breastfeeding Initiation and 
Duration are Public Health Priorities of 
the United States 
Across federal agencies, significant re-
sources are appropriated and authorized to 
encourage mothers to initiate breastfeeding 
and to continue after returning to work. A 
few examples include: 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
In 2011 a landmark policy document, The 
Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support 
Breastfeeding, outlined measurable goals 
and objectives for stakeholders’ efforts to 
align national policy with public health 
goals. While progress has been made over the 
past decade because of the recommended ac-
tions, there continue to be gaps and opportu-
nities to address policies that support 
breastfeeding including those related to em-
ployment and the workforce. 
The Office of Women’s Health offers sup-
port for women through published guidance 
and notably for employers through its ‘‘Busi-
ness Case for Breastfeeding.’’ 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
The Women, Infants and Children’s Pro-
gram receives appropriated funds to support 
its peer counseling program and the program 
extends participation to women who con-
tinue to breastfeed for one-year post-partum. 
The 2020–2025 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans led by the USDA recently added 
new recommendations for children from 
birth to two years of age. As noted, a key 
recommendation is that for the first 6 
months of life, infants should be fed human 
milk. After 6 months of life, complementary 
foods and breastfeeding are recommended 
until one year of age. 
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND 
PREVENTION 
The Centers CDC has made breastfeeding a 
public health priority and encourages state 
health departments, hospitals and local com-
munities to implement public health goals 
and align resources to support breastfeeding 
rates for communities of color. ‘‘Because of 
the importance of breastfeeding for the 
health of mothers and babies, CDC supports 
breastfeeding through hospital initiatives, 
work site accommodation, continuity of 
care, and community support initiatives.’’ 
The federal government advocates for 
breastfeeding and its continuance for work-
ing women, but laws and regulations don’t 
make it easy for women in all sectors of the 
workforce to fulfill breastfeeding public 
health goals and objectives. 
Why will the PUMP Act help? 
It 
is 
reasonable 
to 
expect 
that 
if 
breastfeeding and workplace accommoda-
tions are seen as public health priorities by 
the federal government and tax-payer dollars 
are used to fund programs designed to en-
courage and support breastfeeding for the 
public, that policies protecting and advanc-
ing the interest of the government’s invest-
ment should be implemented. The PUMP Act 
is one such policy that will eliminate bar-
riers for women who are teachers, flight at-
tendants and other exempt workers. 
The bi-partisan PUMP Act will bring eq-
uity to nearly nine million women in the 
workforce and their families who currently 
lack protections as they seek to provide rec-
ommended nutrition to their new babies. 
Women in the workforce are striving for 
economic stability to help support their fam-
ilies. The country benefits from their con-
tributions to our economy. Instead of focus-
ing on what happens when employees need 
unpaid time to feed their baby as their doc-
tor, nutrition experts, and the U.S. govern-
ment recommend, consider what happens and 
the cost to our nation when they do not. 
Through WIC, the U.S. government provides 
services to approximately 53 percent of all 
U.S. infants. Infant formula is the most ex-
pensive item in WIC food packages and costs 
to the government exceeded $927 million in 
fiscal year 2010. The direct cost to the gov-
ernment of providing infant formula and the 
related indirect cost of employee turn-over, 
absenteeism and most importantly, the in-
creased health care costs of formula-fed in-
fants make this bill a win for all parties and 
protects the economic interest of the U.S. 
Perhaps then Federal Reserve Chair and 
current Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen 
said it best in an essay following her 2017 re-
marks at the ‘‘125 Years of Women at Brown 
Conference’’ sponsored by Brown University 
in Providence, Rhode Island: 
‘‘. . . a number of factors appear to be 
holding women back, including the difficulty 
women currently have in trying to combine 
their careers with other aspects of their 
lives, including caregiving. In looking to so-
lutions, we should consider improvements to 
work environments and policies that benefit 
not only women, but all workers. Pursuing 
such a strategy would be in keeping with the 
story of the rise in women’s involvement in 
the workforce, which has contributed not 
only to their own well-being but more broad-
ly to the welfare and prosperity of our coun-
try.’’ 
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 
urges all members of Congress to vote in sup-
port of this bill because it is the right step 
to support babies, mothers, employers and 
ultimately the health and prosperity of our 
nation. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
JEANNE BLANKENSHIP, MS 
RDN, 
Vice President, Policy 
Initiatives and Ad-
vocacy, Academy of 
Nutrition 
and 
Di-
etetics. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 leaves a 
whole host of unanswered questions for 
employers regarding their obligations 
under the bill as written. H.R. 3110 
threatens job creators with dispropor-
tionate penalties for technical or unin-
tentional violations of the FLSA’s ac-
commodation requirements. 
For example, are employers required 
to build a separate room to provide 
these accommodations? 
H.R. 3110 fails to answer this question 
or the circumstances and specifications 
an employer would need to know to 
comply with such a requirement, or 
how such requirements would interact 
with other Federal laws. 
For instance, the bill does not clarify 
whether the space must be compliant 
with Americans with Disabilities Act, 
ADA, accessibility requirements, or 
how it will fit in with the ADA require-
ments, such as clear path of travel. Nor 
does the legislation give appropriate 
guidance as to whether the space must 
be permanent or temporary. In addi-
tion, the remedies in H.R. 3110 go far 
beyond what is recoverable with re-
spect to other proven wage-and-hour 
and break violations under both Fed-
eral law and State laws. 
The expansion of remedies in the bill 
will increase litigation and result in a 
financial windfall for trial lawyers. But 
these penalties do not address the em-
ployees’ main interest in obtaining ap-
propriate break time and space. Ex-
panded monetary damages will un-
doubtedly lead to more litigation and 
the additional delays that litigation 
brings in already overburdened courts. 
It also should be noted that the De-
partment of Labor is better suited to 
enforce technical violations of the 
FLSA quickly and effectively; litiga-
tion is no solution. 
DOL has institutional knowledge of 
Federal 
labor 
laws, 
including 
the 
FLSA, and is equipped to provide accu-
rate guidance to employers. 
To understand the implications of 
H.R. 3110, one only needs to look at the 
proliferation of lawsuits for ‘‘gotcha’’ 
technical violations throughout var-
ious Federal and State wage-and-hour 
laws or the ADA to recognize that cost-
ly litigation will follow and positive re-
sults for employees will be delayed. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Civil Rights and 
Human Services Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the bipartisan 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act. 
Since 2010, the Affordable Care Act 
has required employers to provide 
nursing mothers with break time to ex-
press milk, as well as access to a pri-
vate non-bathroom space for pumping. 
Although this was a significant im-
provement 
for 
working 
moms—one 
that 
I 
didn’t 
have 
when 
I 
was 
breastfeeding my babies—the law still 
left 9 million workers uncovered, in-
cluding teachers, agriculture workers, 
engineers, and others. 
This coverage gap is unacceptable, 
and it means that each year millions of 
parents who choose to breastfeed must

decide between the health of their 
child and maintaining employment. 
The coverage gap has also dispropor-
tionately harmed Black and brown 
women, who represent 12 percent of the 
workforce but nearly 20 percent of 
women of childbearing age who are not 
covered by the existing break time pro-
vision. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
will address this coverage gap by sim-
ply amending the Fair Labor Standards 
Act to provide protections to workers 
who are not currently covered. 
As Representative HERRARA BEUTLER 
explained, this is current law. We are 
just closing a gap that is leaving too 
many nursing moms out. It will also 
clarify that if a worker is not relieved 
of their duties during the time spent 
pumping, then those hours must count 
as hours worked. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rights of women 
in the workplace and to help their fam-
ilies by joining me in voting for the bi-
partisan PUMP Act. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter in support of the bill 
from the United States Breastfeeding 
Committee.

OF
THE
U.S. 
BREASTFEEDING
COMMITTEE
BEFORE

HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES—SEPTEMBER 24, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, AND
ALL
MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. 
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES: 
The 
U.S. 
Breastfeeding Committee (USBC) submits 
this letter to the U.S. House of Representa-
tives in full support of the Providing Urgent 
Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing 
Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). 
The USBC is a coalition of more than 100 
national nonprofits, breastfeeding coalitions, 
community-based organizations, and federal 
agency partners that support a shared mis-
sion to drive collaborative efforts for policy 
and practices that create a landscape of 
breastfeeding support across the United 
States. We are committed to ensuring that 
all families in the U.S. have the support, re-
sources, and accommodations to achieve 
their breastfeeding goals in the communities 
where they live, learn, work, and play. 
We know that the vast majority of people 
become parents during their lifetime, and 
their needs and the needs of their infants are 
neither surprising nor difficult to meet if we 
plan appropriately. A simple and common- 
sense policy solution to address ongoing 
workplace barriers and inequities is within 
the reach of Congress through the Providing 
Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for 
Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110), which 
strengthens the existing Break Time for 
Nursing Mothers law and has bipartisan and 
bicameral support. 
HUMAN MILK: A PROVEN PREVENTION STRATEGY 
Breastfeeding is a primary prevention 
strategy that builds a foundation for life- 
long health and wellness, adapting overtime 
to meet the changing needs of the growing 
child. The evidence for the value of human 
milk feeding to overall health is scientific, 
robust, and continually being reaffirmed by 
new researcher. 
Human milk feeding is proven to reduce 
the risk of a range of illnesses and conditions 
for infants and mothers. Compared with 
commercial 
milk 
formula 
fed 
children, 
breastfed infants have a reduced risk of ear, 
skin, stomach, and respiratory infections; di-
arrhea; and sudden infant death syndrome. 
In the longer term, breastfed children have a 
reduced risk of obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, 
asthma, and childhood leukemia. Women 
who breastfed their children have a reduced 
long-term risk of type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, and breast and ovarian can-
cers. The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends infants be exclusively breastfed 
for 
about 
6 
months 
with 
continued 
breastfeeding while introducing complemen-
tary foods for at least 1 year. 
BARRIERS TO SUCCESS 
The great majority of pregnant women and 
new parents want to breastfeed, but signifi-
cant barriers in the community, health care, 
and 
employment 
settings 
can 
impede 
breastfeeding success. In 2017, the national 
breastfeeding initiation rate among infants 
was 84.1 percent, representing a 13.8 percent 
increase from 2001. However, by six months 
of age, only 25.6 percent of U.S. infants ex-
clusively breastfeed. Despite overall in-
creases in breastfeeding initiation and dura-
tion, deep racial, geographic, and socio-
economic disparities in breastfeeding rates 
persist. Compared to national averages, only 
73.7 percent of Black infants and 80.7 percent 
of 
Native 
American 
infants 
are 
ever 
breastfed, contributing to inequalities in 
maternal and infant health outcomes. Fur-
thermore, a distressing 60 percent of mothers 
report that they did not breastfeed for as 
long as they intended. 
Structural and environmental barriers can 
make it difficult or impossible for families 
to establish an adequate milk supply to sus-
tain human milk feeding at medically rec-
ommended levels. For many families, rather 
than being a matter of personal choice, in-
fant feeding practice is informed by cir-
cumstance. 
More than half of mothers enter or return 
to the labor force before their children turn 
one year old, with as many as one in four 
women returning within just two weeks of 
giving birth. When back at work or school, 
many discover that they are unable to pump 
breast milk as frequently as necessary or 
they have no choice but to pump in an un-
sanitary or unsafe location, such as a bath-
room. 
Economically-marginalized 
women 
and non-white women are more likely to re-
turn to work earlier than their more affluent 
white counterparts. Without necessary ac-
commodations, they are too often unable to 
produce enough milk for a caregiver to feed 
their child during separations and may not 
be able to maintain their milk supply. 
Breastfeeding 
families 
throughout 
the 
United States are facing barriers that make 
it difficult or impossible to start or continue 
breastfeeding—but it does not have to be this 
way. Public health initiatives, including 
legal and policy interventions and ap-
proaches designed to enable more infants to 
breastfeed, have the potential to markedly 
improve population health. 
CURRENT LAWS AND SIMPLE ACCOMMODATIONS 
ACROSS INDUSTRIES 
The Break Time for Nursing Mothers law 
(Break Time law), passed in 2010, provides 
critical protections to ensure that employees 
have reasonable break time and a safe, pri-
vate place to pump breast milk. All the same 
strategies that businesses use for any other 
type of break time, such as rest breaks, meal 
breaks, or medical breaks can be utilized to 
support breastfeeding employees. 
Businesses of all sizes and in every indus-
try have found simple, cost-effective ways to 
meet the needs of their breastfeeding em-
ployees as well as their business. The De-
partment of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) Office on Women’s Health hosts the 
Supporting Nursing Moms at Work resource, 
which provides a critical link between the 
need for workplace support for breastfeeding 
families and the need for implementation 
guidance for their employers. The online re-
source provides a user-friendly tool that em-
ployers can use to identify and implement 
industry-specific solutions to providing time 
and space accommodations that work from 
farm fields to grocery stores, and res-
taurants to offices. These examples are al-
ready helping employers and employees iden-
tify practical solutions that work for their 
business. 
In many workspaces, compliance is as sim-
ple as placing butcher paper or a curtain 
over a window in a managers’ office. In out-
door worksites, pop up tents or the cab of a 
construction vehicle are used to meet the 
needs of breastfeeding employees. To be 
functional, the pumping space simply needs 
to be furnished with seating and a flat sur-
face such as a desk, small table, or shelf for 
the breast pump. As long as the space is 
available each time the breastfeeding em-
ployee needs it, the employer is meeting the 
requirements of the law. If there are no 
breastfeeding employees, the employer does 
not need to maintain a space. 
GAPS IN CURRENT LAW AND IMPACT ON 
FAMILIES 
Unfortunately, the placement of the Break 
Time law within section 7(r) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) resulted in 
nearly 9 million women—nearly one in four 
women of childbearing age—being excluded 
from coverage. Those left unprotected in-
clude teachers, software engineers, and many 
nurses, among others. Without these protec-
tions, breastfeeding employees face serious 
health consequences, including risk of pain-
ful illness and infection, diminished milk 
supply, 
or 
in 
ability 
to 
continue 
breastfeeding. 
Over the past decade we have learned how 
to make breastfeeding and employment 
work, but the significant coverage gaps in 
the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law 
mean that workplace breastfeeding accom-
modation implementation is radically incon-
sistent. Employees of the same company and 
in the same building frequently do not have 
access to the same accommodations, and to 
figure out who must be accommodated can 
be complicated for businesses. 
In addition, little recourse is available for 
employees who are covered by the Break 
Time law to ensure they can use their rights. 
Section 7(r) of the FLSA does not specify 
any penalties if an employer is found to have 
violated the break time for nursing mothers 
requirements. This means that in most in-
stances, an employee may only bring an ac-
tion for unpaid minimum wages or unpaid 
overtime compensation and an additional 
equal amount in liquidated damages. Accord-
ing to the Request for Information on the 
Break Time for Nursing Mothers provision, 
which includes the Department of Labor’s 
preliminary interpretations of the law, ‘‘Be-
cause employers are not required to com-
pensate employees for break time to express 
breastmilk, in most circumstances there will 
not be any unpaid minimum wage or over-
time compensation associated with the fail-
ure to provide such breaks. 
A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO SIMPLIFY EXISTING 
LAW: THE PUMP FOR NURSING MOTHERS ACT 
A policy solution with bipartisan support, 
the PUMP Act would support breastfeeding 
employees while clarifying implementation 
for employers across the nation. The bill 
would strengthen the 2010 Break Time law by 
closing the coverage gap and providing rem-
edies for nursing mothers that are available 
for other violations of the FLSA. 
The Break Time for Nursing Mothers pro-
vision is written with language that provides

immense flexibility and does not require the 
construction of a permanent, dedicated lac-
tation space. The PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act would maintain this flexibility. More 
than half of all states have enacted legisla-
tion that impacts breastfeeding employees. 
For many of these states, the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act would have little to no 
impact on employer requirements. 
For over ten years, the U.S. Breastfeeding 
Committee has worked with organizations 
and government agencies on this issue. We 
have documented the experiences of workers 
and employers, seen the innovative solutions 
created by businesses of all sizes, and identi-
fied the legislative gaps that need to be ad-
dressed. After more than a decade of raising 
awareness and mobilizing action, one thing 
is clear: America needs the PUMP for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act. 
By aligning federal law with the needs of 
families and ensuring that employers have 
the comprehensive resources and support 
that they need, we can create a better to-
morrow together. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
NIKIA SANKOFA, 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 
U.S. Breastfeeding Committee. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, supporters of H.R. 
3110 claim the bill merely fills unin-
tended gaps in the nursing-accommo-
dation requirements signed into law in 
2010, but this description is not accu-
rate. 
H.R. 3110 imposes a flawed scheme 
full of unreasonable expanded man-
dates, including overly-broad coverage 
coupled with gratuitous and dispropor-
tionate penalties. The bill expands the 
Fair Labor Standards Act’s coverage of 
break time for nursing mothers to all 
143 million employees covered by the 
act. As a result, H.R. 3110 will require 
one-size-fits-all nursing accommoda-
tions and impose substantial compli-
ance burdens on a wide variety of 
workplaces and industries. 
Admitting this problem in the under-
lying bill, the manager’s amendment 
attempts to mitigate the bill’s require-
ments so that they are compatible with 
ensuring safety and security for airline 
passengers and flight crews. 
H.R. 3110 requires that airline em-
ployees have access to an enclosed area 
for pumping breast milk, even though 
aircrafts designs are regulated by the 
FAA for safety, security, and reli-
ability, with limited ability to add ad-
ditional enclosed space. Remote and 
rural airports also face unique chal-
lenges because of the smaller planes in 
use at those airports. It is even more 
challenging to provide a private space 
in a commercial aircraft other than a 
bathroom, as mandated by H.R. 3110. 
Additionally, many of these planes 
have small flight crews with few 
redundancies in duties. Under the bill, 
they would be hard-pressed to maintain 
appropriate staffing levels and access 
to services. Exposing businesses to in-
flexible and unworkable requirements, 
coupled with increased penalties for al-
leged violations, will clearly create 
new incentives for trial lawyers. 
H.R. 3110 will only encourage trial 
lawyers to file more lawsuits of ques-
tionable 
validity 
targeting 
unsuspecting business owners. Sup-
porters of H.R. 3110 say the bill is about 
providing women with better accom-
modations in the workplace, but the 
truth is the bill fails to live up to that 
promise. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, consideration of 
H.R. 3110 marks the latest in a series of 
affronts to small businesses perpet-
uated by House Democrats throughout 
the 117th Congress. Last month, Demo-
crat members of the Committee on 
Education and Labor voted to increase 
drastically the penalties on employers, 
including a 512 percent increase in Oc-
cupational Safety and Health Act pen-
alties and a whopping 900 percent in-
crease in Fair Labor Standards Act 
penalties on job creators, including 
small businesses. 
Democrats also voted to authorize 
the National Labor Relations Board to 
levy $50,000 and $100,000 fines on small 
business owners for business activities 
that are currently lawful. 
Republican Members offered several 
amendments at the committee’s rec-
onciliation markup to exempt small 
businesses from the devastating im-
pacts of those provisions. However, 
these commonsense amendments were 
voted down by committee Democrats 
on party-line votes. 
The bill we are debating today was 
reported out of committee with dis-
turbing implications for smaller em-
ployers. Currently under the FLSA, 
businesses with fewer than 50 employ-
ees may demonstrate that the FLSA’s 
nursing-accommodation 
requirements 
would impose an undue hardship. The 
FLSA’s unique hardship provision is an 
affirmative defense to claims that 
small businesses must demonstrate in 
court. 
Committee Democrats chose to cut 
the undue hardship exemption in half 
to fewer than 25 employees. While this 
Democrat affront to small business was 
corrected in the manager’s amend-
ment, more changes are necessary to 
protect small businesses fully. 
H.R. 3110 imposes excessive penalties 
for minor or technical violations of the 
FLSA’s 
nursing-accommodation 
re-
quirement, while failing to anticipate 
workplace realities in providing ac-
commodations. These excessive pen-
alties, combined with the high prob-
ability of minor or unintended infrac-
tions related to compliance with a 
complex mandate on hundreds of thou-
sands of new businesses, will lead to a 
proliferation of expensive and pro-
tracted lawsuits, resulting in delayed 
accommodations for workers. 
In contrast to the shortcomings of 
H.R. 3110, Dr. MILLER-MEEKS submitted 
a responsible substitute amendment for 
consideration, which implements com-
monsense and workable alterations to 
the FLSA’s nursing-accommodation re-
quirements. The Miller-Meeks’ amend-
ment adds nursing accommodation cov-
erage for white collar executive, ad-
ministrative, or professional employees 
while preserving FLSA treatment of 
unique and disparate workplaces. 
Her amendment also preserves the 
Secretary of Labor’s FLSA enforce-
ment 
authority 
to 
address 
short-
comings in workplace accommodations 
through injunctive relief or levy civil 
monetary penalties against repeat and 
willful violators. 
DR. 
MILLER-MEEKS’ 
amendment 
would not only ensure that the needs of 
small businesses are protected, but 
would also update FLSA nursing-ac-
commodation requirements in a way 
that meets the needs of both mothers 
and employers. 
It is disappointing and unfortunate 
that the Democrat leadership pre-
vented the Miller-Meeks’ amendment 
from being considered today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, if 
we adopt the motion to recommit, we 
will instruct the Committee on Edu-
cation 
and 
Labor 
to 
consider 
an 
amendment to exempt certain indus-
tries with unique workplace environ-
ments from the requirements in the 
underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). Is there objection to the 
request 
of 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas? 
There was no objection. 
b 1000 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, 
H.R. 3110 imposes one-size-fits-all nurs-
ing accommodation requirements on 
different kinds of work environments, 
including those found in the airline, 
shipping, and agriculture industries. 
As a mother of two who nursed both 
children while working, I understand 
the importance of having these accom-
modations in the workplace. 
Under current law, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act provides hourly employ-
ees with access to accommodations 
while providing for certain industry 
and job specific exemptions. This ap-
proach includes special protections to 
include the smallest of farms, which 
are not proportionally impacted by 
regulatory mandates such as the one 
we are debating today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5808 
October 22, 2021 
The mandate in H.R. 3110 would im-
pose the same requirements on all 143 
million employees covered under the 
FLSA. This would impose substantial 
compliance challenges and introduce 
safety concerns based on the nature of 
business operations in certain settings. 
For example, this would fail to account 
for the unique working conditions 
found in the aviation industry. 
H.R. 3110 requires that airline em-
ployees, who are currently exempt 
from FLSA breastfeeding accommoda-
tion requirements, have access to a 
space for pumping breast milk. This is 
despite the fact that aircraft designs 
are regulated by the FAA for safety 
and reliability purposes with limited 
ability 
to 
add 
additional 
private 
spaces. 
Modification of aircraft space would 
be prohibitively expensive and require 
the removal of airline seats. This re-
quirement is even more challenging for 
smaller planes with fewer passenger 
seats that service regional airports. 
Additionally, pilot and flight attend-
ant duties are heavily regulated by the 
FAA with few redundancies in duties 
among staff, complicating the ability 
of aviation businesses to maintain ap-
propriate staffing levels and access to 
services when faced with inflexible gov-
ernment-mandated breaks. 
Democrats acknowledged this prob-
lem in their manager’s amendment to 
H.R. 3110 but failed to mitigate the 
negative impacts the bill would have 
on critical passenger safety and secu-
rity functions, both on the ground and 
during flight. 
Because workplaces are not one-size- 
fits-all, it is critical that any legisla-
tion in this area preserves flexibility 
for airline, shipping, and small farm 
employers to work with their employ-
ees to develop best practices in meet-
ing individual workplace needs. 
Sweeping and overly prescriptive re-
quirements that do not adequately ad-
dress both the workplace environment 
and workplace needs will not lead to 
the best results for working mothers. 
Nursing 
mother 
accommodations 
should be encouraged, and the ongoing 
efforts of businessowners to ensure ac-
cess for their workers are to be ap-
plauded and supported. 
I am going to offer this motion to re-
commit to ensure certain businesses 
have the flexibility to be able to de-
velop nursing accommodations that 
meet the needs of their employees 
while accounting for unique working 
environments. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption 
of this motion to recommit. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 is not the 
right way to empower women in the 
workplace. 
I support expanding flexible nursing 
accommodations in the workplace for 
women, but not in such a way that will 
unnecessarily increase liability for em-
ployers without helping nursing moth-
ers. 
Furthermore, this bill levels exces-
sive penalties for minor technical vio-
lations, opening our job creators to ex-
pensive and spurious lawsuits. 
Dr. MILLER-MEEKS’ Supporting Work-
ing Mothers amendment is a respon-
sible alternative. It expands nursing 
accommodation coverage to a variety 
of workplaces but also maintains ex-
ceptions for unique workplaces. 
That is the kind of flexible pro- 
woman and pro-jobs solution we need. 
We have had enough of Democrats’ one- 
size-fits-all approach and overly broad 
mandates that hurt the very job cre-
ators we are relying on to help our 
economy recover from this pandemic. 
It is very disappointing that the major-
ity denied debate on a practical alter-
native that will meet the needs of 
working mothers. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3110. This 
bill would do much more harm than 
good. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD let-
ters in support of the bill from the 
AFSCME and the Association of Flight 
Attendants-CWA. 
AMERICAN
FEDERATION
OF
STATE, 
COUNTY
AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOY-
EES, AFL-CIO, 
Washington, DC, October 21, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.4 
million members of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees 
(AFSCME), I urge you to vote yes on the 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (R.R. 3110). 
This bill prioritizes both the physical and 
economic needs that new mothers must bal-
ance upon returning to work. It strengthens 
federal employment standards that protect 
working women who need break time and a 
private space, other than a bathroom, to ex-
press breast milk. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) cur-
rently requires employers with more than 50 
employees to provide a space for mothers to 
either nurse or express breast milk. Covered 
employers must also provide reasonable 
breaks for workers to nurse. An estimated 
8.65 million women of childbearing age are 
excluded from these nursing mother protec-
tions because they are not covered by wage 
and hour standards under the FLSA. Current 
law also lacks broader enforcement mecha-
nisms for workers denied these protections. 
H.R. 3110 improves current protections by: 
Expanding the number of nursing workers 
protected by the law. 
Extending the duration of the protections 
from one year after the child’s birth to two 
years after the employee gives birth or be-
gins providing breast milk for a nursing 
child. 
Limiting undue hardship exemption to em-
ployers with fewer than 25 employees, rather 
than employers with fewer than 50 employ-
ees under current law. 
Clarifying that banned workers can seek 
legal and equitable relief for their employ-
er’s failure to provide them with the needed 
break times and private space to express 
milk. 
We urge you to stand with working women 
and their families by voting to pass H.R. 
3110. 
Sincerely, 
BAILEY K. CHILDERS, 
Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
WRITTEN STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF 
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS-CWA (AFA), AFL-CIO 
BEFORE THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES—SEPTEMBER 27, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: The 
Association 
of 
Flight 
Attendants-CWA 
(AFA) AFL-CIO submits this letter to the 
U.S. House of Representatives in full support 
of the Providing Urgent Maternal Protec-
tions (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 
3110). 
AFA represents nearly 50,000 Flight At-
tendants at 17 airlines. Our union has ad-
vanced the Flight Attendant profession for 
75 years, beating back discrimination and 
improving wages, benefits, working condi-
tions, and aviation safety, health and secu-
rity in the aircraft cabin. When the profes-
sion began Flight Attendants could not be 
married or pregnant, among other discrimi-
natory conditions of employment. 
For years, AFA has identified the need for 
federal protections for nursing Flight At-
tendants because none exist. In 2010, the 
Break Time law, which amended the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to require that 
employers provide reasonable break time as 
well as a private place other than a bath-
room to express milk provided a monu-
mental step in the right direction. However, 
millions of nursing mothers were uninten-
tionally left out of this important piece of 
legislation. The PUMP Act finally rectifies 
this oversight and includes Flight Attend-
ants. 
In 2021, AFA conducted a survey of almost 
400 Flight Attendants to understand their 
perspective 
on 
pumping 
and 
expressing 
breast milk during the course of their work 
day. An overwhelming majority (86 percent) 
of Flight Attendant respondents indicated 
that they faced significant obstacles pump-
ing while on and off duty, as well as in be-
tween flights. As a result, 75 percent of 
Flight Attendant respondents decided to quit 
pumping and expressing breast milk before 
they planned to because it was too difficult 
to find the time, a private location, a clean 
environment, and access to cold storage for 
their milk. 
We support the PUMP Act because it will 
alleviate many of these obstacles for nursing 
Flight Attendant moms to ensure they have 
the right, along with the privacy, to pump 
and express milk. We realize this is a com-
plex issue for Flight Attendants who work in 
an unconventional workplace. However, we 
can and should do better to support these 
nursing mothers in the workplace. 
We urge all members of Congress to vote in 
support of H.R. 3110, the PUMP Act. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
STEVE SCHEMBS, 
Director of Government Affairs, Association of 
Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA). 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, it has now been 
more than a decade since Congress 
passed critical protections to guar-
antee nursing workers break time and 
private space to express breast milk at 
work. 
As we have heard today from Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle, these 
protections are essential to protecting 
the health of nursing workers and their

October 22, 2021 
families, yet nursing workers are con-
tinuing to suffer from gaps and weak-
nesses in the Federal law. 
The need to address these gaps is 
even greater today as our economy re-
covers from COVID–19. Millions of 
workers, particularly working moth-
ers, are looking to re-enter the work-
force after being forced out of their 
jobs during the pandemic. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act 
would provide workers with the peace 
of mind that they will not have to 
choose between returning to work and 
protecting themselves and their babies. 
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity to deliver on our promise to 
help all workers recover from the pan-
demic, stay safe, and succeed in their 
careers. This legislation will strength-
en existing law, improve the lives of 
nursing workers across the country, 
and help our economy get back on its 
feet. 
We know this program works because 
the provisions in this bill are already 
law on the Federal level and in several 
States, without the kind of problems 
that have been suggested that might 
happen—those have not occurred under 
present law—and without any explo-
sion of lawsuits. These provisions are 
already law, and there have not been 
lawsuits. 
The substitute offered by the minor-
ity does not expand to as many moth-
ers as this bill does, and it would actu-
ally roll back some protections they al-
ready have. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the gentle-
woman from Washington State (Ms. 
HERRERA BEUTLER) for their leadership 
on this bipartisan legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the PUMP for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
as chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce 
Protection; co-founder and co-chair of the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus; as one of the 
original cosponsors of the bipartisan PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act; and as the mother of 
Jeanelle and Billy. 
The issue before us today is one of equity 
and fairness. In our country, mothers often 
have to choose between providing for their 
families or nursing their babies. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act ensures 
that millions of working mothers have the ac-
cess and protections they need to nurse for as 
long as they choose to do so. 
So, why is this Bill so important? As the co- 
chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, I 
know how important it is to break down the 
barriers that hold nursing mothers and their 
children back from the best possible health 
outcomes. 
Every major medical authority strongly en-
courages nursing for at least the first year of 
life, as it provides significant health and nutri-
tional benefits to both the mother and infant. 
By closing an unintended loophole, the 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act provides pro-
tection and support to an additional 9 million 
working mothers who have been forced to 
choose between nursing and earning a pay-
check. 
Fundamentally, this bill says that nursing 
mothers should not be punished for making 
the best choices for their health, and the 
health of their children. 
Especially during this pandemic and Amer-
ica’s maternal health crisis, I urge each of my 
colleagues to cast a vote for this critical legis-
lation, and I urge the Senate to send it to 
President Biden’s desk. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support H.R. 3110, the ‘‘Pump for 
Nursing Mothers Act,’’ which will close an un-
intentional loophole in the 2010 Break Time 
for Nursing Mothers Act. 
The 2010 law requires employers to provide 
break time and a place for hourly wage-earn-
ing and some salaried employees to express 
breast milk at work for one year after the birth 
of the employee’s child. 
Unfortunately, this law unintentionally ex-
cluded a quarter of all working women—nearly 
nine million employees—from protection. 
H.R. 3110 closes this coverage gap by ex-
tending the law’s protections to cover salaried 
employees as well as other categories of em-
ployees currently exempted from protections, 
such as teachers, nurses, and farmworkers. 
H.R. 3110 would also provide employers 
clarity on paid and unpaid pumping time. 
The bill leaves in place existing law pro-
tecting many salaried workers from having 
their pay docked and clarifies that employers 
must pay an hourly employee for any time 
spent pumping if the employee is also work-
ing. 
Lastly, the bill would ensure that nursing 
mothers have access to remedies that are 
available for other violations of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
According to the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, women with children are 
the fastest-growing segment of the workforce, 
and balancing work and family is an important 
priority for all employees. 
More than 80% of new mothers in the 
United States begin breastfeeding, 1 and 6 in 
every 10 new mothers are in the workforce. 
New parents face an incredible amount of 
increased difficulties while juggling work, fam-
ily and mental and emotional tolls that are ex-
acerbated as a new parent. 
According to a study published in Reviews 
in Obstetrics and Gynecology, breastfeeding 
provides health benefits for not only infants, 
but also for mothers. 
For mothers, abstaining from breastfeeding 
has been associated with an increase in de-
veloping various types of cancers, type 2 dia-
betes, heart attacks, retained gestational 
weight gain and metabolic syndrome in adult 
women. 
For infants, not being breastfed is associ-
ated with infectious illnesses such as pneu-
monia, ear infections, gastroenteritis, and can 
increase the risk of developing childhood- 
onset obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, leukemia 
and SIDS. 
This bill will ensure that mothers will no 
longer be forced to choose between their own 
health, their infant’s health, and their income. 
This includes individuals like Melissa Hodg-
kins, who has had to bring suit against her 
employer simply to provide workers with a 
clean, private place and breaks to breast 
pump at work. 
Her coworkers were often of losing their 
paychecks to ask the airline to accommodate 
them; in fact, when some of her coworkers did 
ask for breaks and a place to pump, her em-
ployer actually prohibited them from pumping 
at work, and even forced them off the job with-
out a paycheck. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will stop 
such bad actions by employers and alleviate 
the disparities that currently exist between 
breastfeeding employees and their coworkers, 
sending a clear message that the workforce 
will protect and support women who opt to 
balance a career and motherhood. 
For these reasons, I encourage all Members 
to support H.R. 3110, the ‘‘Pump for Nursing 
Mothers Act.’’ 
[From ACLU, Sept. 30, 2021] 
THE PUMP ACT WOULD PROTECT NURSING 
WORKERS LIKE ME 
(By Melissa Hodgkins) 
I took Frontier Airlines to court for mak-
ing it impossible for me to pump breast milk 
at work. Other workers shouldn’t have to 
fight for their rights like I did. 
When started my career as a flight attend-
ant, I never imagined that I wouldn’t be able 
to continue breastfeeding after I went back 
to work. I thought that, like most work-
places, my airline would be required by fed-
eral law to provide workers a clean, private 
place and breaks to pump at work. (That’s 
thanks to a provision known as the Break 
Time for Nursing Mothers law.) 
But it turns out my employer isn’t. That’s 
because flight attendants are among the ap-
proximately 9 million women who are ex-
cluded from the law’s protection—along with 
other transportation workers, teachers, agri-
cultural workers, nurses, and many others. A 
bill before Congress right now—the PUMP 
for Nursing Mothers Act—would fix that. 
Congress should act now to pass it. 
I first realized the pickle I was in when I 
became pregnant with my first child and 
found out that my employer, Frontier Air-
lines, didn’t provide any accommodations for 
nursing moms. I’d watched other flight at-
tendant moms trying to make it work pump-
ing on the job—and I saw how stressful it 
was for them. 
They were too fearful of losing their pay-
checks to ask the airline to accommodate 
them. When some of my coworkers did ask 
for breaks and a place to pump, Frontier ac-
tually prohibited them from pumping at 
work, and even forced them off the job with-
out a paycheck. 
That was when I started to feel like Fron-
tier was making me choose between my ca-
reer and breastfeeding my baby. I believe 
breast milk is optimal for babies, and I want-
ed to give him those health benefits. At the 
same time, I didn’t feel great about pumping 
in an unsanitary airplane lavatory, and hav-
ing to scramble to find time to pump be-
tween flights, especially given my unpredict-
able schedule. I was worried I’d lose my job 
if I had to pump on duty and got reported. 
Even though I desperately wanted to keep 
nursing my baby, I just couldn’t see how I 
could make it work. It was a wrenching deci-
sion, but I decided I had no choice but to 
give up breastfeeding in order to go back to 
work and support my family. 
No woman should have to make that kind 
of decision. But because of the gap in cov-
erage under the current law, too many of us 
still do. The ACLU is representing me in a 
lawsuit arguing that Frontier’s treatment of 
pregnant and breastfeeding pilots and flight 
attendants is discriminatory. But if the air-
line had not been exempt from the duty 
under the existing federal Break Time Law 
to provide breaks and a clean place to pump, 
we probably would have never had to take 
Frontier to court over that in the first place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5810 
October 22, 2021 
The PUMP Act would give workers like me 
the protection we need: a clear requirement 
that all employers must provide workers 
who are nursing with the basic accommoda-
tions they need. Solutions exist in all indus-
tries—including airlines—that would allow 
employees to pump safely. And the bill 
would strengthen the law in other ways, ex-
tending protections from one year to two 
years, clarifying that it covers situations 
like adoption or stillbirth, and ensuring that 
when employers are not in compliance, there 
is a meaningful way to enforce it. 
The bill has bipartisan support in Con-
gress. Let’s make sure it becomes law so 
that all workers—no matter what industry 
they work in—have the choice to continue 
breastfeeding and the ability to get back to 
work. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Each further amendment printed in 
part D of House Report 117–137 shall be 
considered only in the order printed in 
the report, may be offered only by a 
Member designated in the report, shall 
be considered as read, shall be debat-
able for the time specified in the report 
equally divided and controlled by the 
proponent and an opponent, may be 
withdrawn by the proponent at any 
time before the question is put there-
on, shall not be subject to amendment, 
and shall not be subject to a demand 
for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. ROSS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
137. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. 4. REPORT. 
Not later than 24 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall submit a 
report to the Committee on Education and 
Labor of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions of the Senate that contains 
recommendations as appropriate to improve 
compliance among covered employers, in-
cluding what is known about employee 
awareness of the rights afforded to them by 
the amendments made by this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
support for my amendment. My amend-
ment to the PUMP for Nursing Moth-
ers Act would help ensure women have 
sufficient notice of the new protections 
afforded to them in this bill. 
By ensuring that eligible people are 
provided with sufficient informational 
resources, more women will be able to 
exercise their rights and the likelihood 
of employer defection will be reduced. 
In many places in this country, in-
cluding my home State of North Caro-
lina, it is easier to take a smoke break 
than for a mother to take a pump 
break. This is simply unacceptable. 
By passing the PUMP for Nursing 
Mothers Act, we can end this discrimi-
nation against breastfeeding workers 
and guarantee that no mother will 
have to choose between earning a liv-
ing and feeding her child. 
But a law is only as effective as its 
enforcement, and we have unfortu-
nately witnessed countless occasions 
where businesses have failed to inform 
workers of their rights. Just in this 
last year, the Department of Labor in-
vestigated six businesses in North 
Carolina for violations of breastfeeding 
rights under the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. 
My amendment would provide the 
necessary information to ensure these 
workplace violations do not continue. 
We owe it to our nursing mothers, 
their families, and our local commu-
nities to be vigilant about overseeing 
the implementation of this law. 
This is a gender equality issue, a 
labor rights issue, and an economic jus-
tice issue that demands our attention. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters from the director of La 
Leche and the National WIC Associa-
tion. 
WRITTEN STATEMENT OF DIANE THOMPSON, DI-
RECTOR OF LA LECHE LEAGUE ALLIANCE FOR 
BREASTFEEDING
EDUCATION
BEFORE
THE 
UNITED
STATES
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES—SEPTEMBER 24, 2021 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: La Leche League Alliance 
for Breastfeeding Education submits this let-
ter to the U.S. House of Representatives in 
full support of the Providing Urgent Mater-
nal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers 
Act (H.R. 3110). 
La 
Leche 
League 
Alliance 
for 
Breastfeeding Education (LLL Alliance) is a 
division of La Leche League International in 
the United States. While we receive our 
501(c)(3) tax-exempt status as a charitable 
organization through our association with 
LLLI, we are a separately incorporated enti-
ty. 
Representing over 1000 Leaders spread 
across 43 states, LLL Alliance provides re-
sources and support for La Leche League 
Leaders and Area Administrators, as well as 
information and support for parents. 
La 
Leche 
League 
believes 
that 
breastfeeding, with its many important 
physical and psychological advantages, is 
best for baby and mother and is the ideal 
way to initiate good parent-child relation-
ships. 
Breastfeeding is crucial to the health of 
both mothers and babies. It provides protec-
tions and health benefits for far longer than 
the duration of the breastfeeding relation-
ship. Why would the USA not want to en-
courage and support the feeding of human 
milk? Some of the advantages include for 
mothers: lower risk of breast cancer, lower 
risk of ovarian cancer, lower risk of rheu-
matoid arthritis and lupus, and less endo-
metriosis. For children: fewer instances of 
allergies, eczema, and asthma, fewer child-
hood 
cancers, 
including 
leukemia 
and 
lymphomas, lower risk of type I and II diabe-
tes, fewer instances of Crohn’s disease and 
colitis. See the CDC, American Academy of 
Pediatrics and the World Health Organiza-
tion. 
We have Leaders and parents that are sup-
ported who are denied the opportunity to 
pump at work because of the types of jobs 
they have. Especially affected are teachers 
in the K–12 system and nurses who are not 
currently covered. This can have several ef-
fects. Mastitis caused by not pumping—these 
leads to lost days at work and possibly the 
cessation 
of 
breastfeeding. 
It 
is 
dis-
appointing that those individuals who do so 
much caretaking can be deprived of care-
taking for their own children. 
Why would the PUMP act be helpful? 
Among other reasons it would close the cov-
erage gap. The bill would protect nearly 9 
million employees excluded from the 2010 
Break Time law by extending the law’s pro-
tections to cover salaried employees as well 
as other categories of employees currently 
exempted from protections. 
It would provide employers clarity on 
when pumping time must be paid and when 
it may be unpaid. The bill leaves in place ex-
isting law protecting many salaried workers 
from having their pay docked and clarifies 
that any time spent pumping while the em-
ployee is also working, a common occurrence 
for many employees, must be counted as 
hours worked. 
This is not a partisan issue—parents of any 
party benefit. 
La 
Leche 
League 
Alliance 
for 
Breastfeeding Education urges all members 
of Congress to vote in support because as 
stated above it closes gaps in the current 
law. Individuals should not have to choose 
between going to the bathroom or pumping. 
Thank you for your consideration.

SEPTEMBER 27, 2021. 
Re National WIC Association Support for the 
Providing Urgent Maternal Protections 
(PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 
3110). 
On behalf of the National WIC Association 
(NWA), the 12,000 service provider agencies 
we represent, and the approximately 6.3 mil-
lion women, infants, and young children our 
members serve, we write to express our 
strong support for the Providing Urgent Ma-
ternal 
Protections 
(PUMP) 
for 
Nursing 
Mothers Act (H.R. 3110). This legislation is a 
critical step towards ensuring healthy child 
development and postpartum health out-
comes for working mothers served by WIC. 
Because millions of nursing moms are in 
the workforce and need protections to pump 
breastmilk, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act is imperative for protecting the nation’s 
breastfeeding women, including WIC partici-
pants. The Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans, based on longstanding recommenda-
tions from the American Academy of Pediat-
rics, promotes exclusive breastfeeding for 
the first six months and encourages ongoing 
breastfeeding as complementary foods are 
introduced. More than half of mothers return 
to the paid labor force before their children 
are three months old, with as many as one in 
four returning within just two weeks of giv-
ing birth. Many of these mothers choose to 
continue breastfeeding well after their re-
turn to work to meet the standards reiter-
ated in the Dietary Guidelines—and those 
employees need to express (or pump) breast 
milk on a regular schedule. 
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-
gram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) 
is the nation’s leading breastfeeding pro-
motion 
program, 
serving 
about 
500,000 
breastfeeding women with a combination of 
professional and peer support. Over the last

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5811 
October 22, 2021 
two decades, WIC providers have worked to 
increase the rates of breastfeeding initiation 
amongst women participating in the pro-
gram by 30%. As WIC works to address soci-
etal, intergenerational, and historic barriers 
to breastfeeding, employment protections 
are vital for the 15.2 million women who live 
in households that earn less than 185% of the 
federal poverty line. 
According 
to 
the 
Surgeon 
General, 
breastfeeding protects babies from illnesses 
like ear, skin, and respiratory infections, di-
arrhea, and vomiting, as well as longer-term 
conditions such as obesity, type 1 and 2 dia-
betes, and asthma. Mothers who breastfeed 
for the recommended duration benefit, from 
lower risks of breast cancer, heart disease, 
and other ailments. Higher breastfeeding 
rates in the United States are associated 
with lower healthcare costs, with the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics projecting $13 
billion in health care savings if 90% of fami-
lies 
in 
the 
United 
States 
exclusively 
breastfed for six months. 
Research 
indicates 
that 
significant 
breastfeeding disparities are sustained by 
both income and race/ethnicity. Lower-in-
come women experience lower breastfeeding 
rates than middle-higher income women. 
Furthermore, Black women experience sig-
nificantly lower breastfeeding rates than 
White women and Latinas. Barriers to 
breastfeeding for these vulnerable groups in-
clude family and social pressures, a rapid re-
turn to work after delivery, lack of facilities 
to breastfeed or pump in the workplace and 
in public, and targeted marketing by the in-
fant formula industry. In order to further 
improve these rates, specifically amongst 
low-income women and women of color, 
workplace barriers to breastfeeding must be 
addressed. 
Passed in 2010, the Break Time for Nursing 
Mothers provision included in the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, provided 
critical protections to ensure that employees 
would have reasonable break time and a pri-
vate place to pump. Since the law was tied to 
language in the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA), millions of nursing mothers were 
left without an express statutory right to 
pump at work. Without these protections, 
nursing mothers face serious health con-
sequences, including risk of painful illness 
and infection, diminished milk supply, or in-
ability to continue breastfeeding. Employ-
ment is compatible with breastfeeding, and 
solutions to support nursing mothers exist in 
all industries. In fact, studies show that sup-
porting nursing mothers leads to lower em-
ployer health care costs, absenteeism, and 
turnover, as well as improved morale, job 
satisfaction, and productivity. Without pro-
tection, nursing employees are likelier to 
face harassment, reduced wages, and job loss. 
The fact remains that nursing mothers are 
suffering negative health consequences and 
being forced to choose between breastfeeding 
and earning a paycheck. The PUMP for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act would strengthen the 2010 
Break Time law by: 
CLOSING THE COVERAGE GAP 
The bill would protect nearly 9 million em-
ployees excluded from the 2010 Break Time 
law by extending the law’s protections to 
cover salaried employees as well as other 
categories of employees currently exempted 
from protections. Unfortunately, the 2010 
Break Time law’s placement within the part 
of FLSA that sets overtime meant that near-
ly 9 million women—nearly one in four 
women of childbearing age—were excluded 
from coverage and have no clear right to 
break time and space to pump breast milk 
under federal law. Those left unprotected in-
clude teachers, software engineers, and many 
types of nurses, among numerous others. The 
categories of employees excluded under 
FLSA predate the 2010 Break Time law, and 
were created specifically with overtime ex-
emptions in mind. There is no principled rea-
son why these working mothers should be in-
eligible to receive break time and space to 
pump breast milk under federal law. The 
PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act fixes this 
harmful error. 
PROVIDING
EMPLOYERS
CLARITY
ON
WHEN 
PUMPING TIME MUST BE PAID AND WHEN IT 
MAY BE UNPAID 
The bill leaves in place existing law pro-
tecting many salaried workers from having 
their pay docked, and clarifies that any time 
spent pumping while the employee is also 
working, a common occurrence for many em-
ployees, must be counted as hours worked. 
Under the existing Break Time law, breaks 
do not need to be paid unless they are con-
current with paid breaks. The PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act clarifies that although 
the breaks taken under the law are typically 
unpaid, if hourly workers are not actually 
relieved from duty while pumping, then that 
time should be counted as hours worked. The 
bill also specifies that it does not change ex-
isting 
protections 
preventing 
employers 
from deducting compensation from the sala-
ries of employees who are exempt from re-
ceiving overtime. 
PROVIDING REMEDIES FOR NURSING MOTHERS 
The bill would ensure that nursing moth-
ers have access to remedies that are avail-
able for other violations of the FLSA, bring-
ing this law into alignment with other re-
quirements that are familiar to employers. 
Another unintended consequence of the 2010 
Break Time law’s placement in the FLSA is 
that an employee who is denied break time 
and space has no effective remedy for the 
violation. An employer that violates the 2010 
Break Time law can be ordered to pay the 
employee ‘‘the amount of their unpaid min-
imum wages,’’ but violations of the Break 
Time law typically do not involve unpaid 
wages. This leaves those who are denied the 
ability to pump without any meaningful way 
to enforce their rights, or to address the neg-
ative health consequences (such as physical 
or emotional suffering from infections or 
early termination of breastfeeding) or finan-
cial harms (like unpaid leave or job loss) 
that they may suffer. In light of the many 
exemptions and the absence of an effective 
way to enforce the law’s requirements, it is 
no 
surprise 
that 
sixty 
percent 
of 
breastfeeding employees still did not have 
access to break time and space after the 2010 
Break Time law was in effect. The PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act fills the gaps in the 2010 
Break Time law so all breastfeeding employ-
ees receive the full protections of the law. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act rep-
resents the next critical step toward bring-
ing federal legislation into alignment with 
the nutrition and practical needs of our na-
tion’s families and their employers. On be-
half of WIC’s national network of lactation 
support professionals and the mothers that 
we serve, we urge your support for this vital 
legislation. 
Sincerely, 
THE NATIONAL WIC ASSOCIATION. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
does nothing to address the short-
comings of H.R. 3110. We do not need a 
GAO report to know that employers 
will face numerous challenges in com-
plying with the sweeping requirements 
imposed by H.R. 3110. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act en-
sures that hourly workers have access 
to time and space to pump breast milk, 
while exempting certain professions 
and industries with unique operating 
environments. 
Working mothers deserve proper ac-
commodations to nurse in a clean and 
safe environment without fear of losing 
their jobs, but failing to account for 
differing workplaces, as H.R. 3110 does, 
is not the way to help women. 
The 
bill 
imposes 
one-size-fits-all 
treatment on a wide variety of busi-
nesses and industries without pro-
viding feasible compliance options. 
H.R. 3110 would also impose new and 
excessive penalties for minor or tech-
nical violations of the FLSA’s nursing 
accommodation 
requirement. 
These 
unrealistic penalties, combined with 
compliance challenges resulting from 
the bill’s mandate, will lead to a pro-
liferation of costly and protracted law-
suits. The result will be delayed accom-
modations for workers. 
A report which acknowledges the 
complexities and liabilities inherent in 
H.R. 3110 and is released 2 years after 
the bill takes effect will do nothing to 
mitigate the bill’s failures. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise strongly 
in support of the amendment offered by 
Representative DEBORAH
ROSS
from 
North Carolina, and I thank her for her 
leadership in North Carolina and here 
in Congress for working mothers, for 
infants, for families. We need more 
work-family balance. We need more 
support for working mothers. 
We now know with COVID that many 
families are not going back to work; 
they are reassessing their values. When 
you have a child and you want to 
breastfeed, and there is no accommoda-
tion, there really is no way you can go 
back to work, so this is pro-business, 
pro-worker, and pro-family. 
Her amendment directs the U.S. Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, GAO, 
to conduct a study on how employers 
are complying with the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act. Even the best 
legislation must be monitored. 
I am excited about the opportunity 
to ensure that employers are pro-
tecting the rights of nursing mothers. 
It is pro-family when you protect our 
mothers and our children. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time, and I have the 
right to close. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to vote in support of my 
amendment and the bill. Both are es-
sential for our working mothers, for

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, we have

opinions of this bill and this amend-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-

working mothers and to businesses in

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MS. STRICKLAND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
137. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. 4. REPORT ON RACIAL DISPARITIES. 
The Comptroller General shall— 
(1) conduct a study on what is known about 
the racial disparities that exist with respect 
to access to pumping breastmilk in the 
workplace; and 
(2) submit to Congress a report on the re-
sults of such study containing such rec-
ommendations as the Comptroller General 
determines appropriate to address those dis-
parities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
STRICKLAND) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there are several 
contributing factors to why nursing 
mothers may choose not to breastfeed 
and pump milk when returning to 
work. They include inflexible work 
schedules 
that 
make 
nursing 
and 
pumping breast milk regularly dif-
ficult; the lack of accommodations to 
pump and store milk; and concerns re-
garding support from supervisors and 
colleagues to pump milk. 
In addition to these factors, women 
of color and low-income women often 
experience the need to return to work 
shortly after giving birth, in many 
cases earlier than 12 weeks, and they 
face additional barriers such as racial 
discrimination and bias whether inten-
tional or not. 
This is why I am proud to offer my 
amendment to H.R. 3110, the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act, the underlying 
bill that protects vulnerable workers 
by expanding access to breastfeeding 
accommodations in the workplace. 
This important piece of legislation 
advances our goals of equity in the 
workplace, and my amendment seeks 
to strengthen this bill by directing the 
GAO to conduct a study on the racial 
disparities that exist in access to 
pumping breast milk in the workplace. 
This amendment will also require 
that GAO submit a report to Congress 
on the results of this study with rec-
ommendations to address any dispari-
ties. 
Employers can begin to address these 
barriers by offering private lactation 
rooms, or nursing rooms, for both 
breastfeeding and pumping with proper 
cleaning and storage facilities such as 
a table, sink, and small refrigerator, 
providing employees with adequate 
pump breaks, allowing flexible work 
schedules, and guaranteeing paid fam-
ily leave. 
In fact, we can look to my home 
State of Washington as a prime exam-
ple of how to lead on this issue. In 2019, 
the State legislature passed and signed 
into law House Bill 1930, which goes 
one step further than the current Fed-
eral law by expanding pump break 
rights to include both salaried and 
hourly employees, requiring employers 
to provide a private space for pumping 
that isn’t a bathroom, and allowing 
mothers to get pump breaks for up to 2 
years after birth. Washington is also 
one of the very few States that pro-
vides people with up to 12 weeks paid 
parental leave after the birth or adop-
tion of a child. 
Yet, despite current Federal law, 
strong State-level protections such as 
the ones in Washington, and the gains 
that have been made in this area by 
employers in different sectors across 
our Nation, racial disparities in the 
workplace still exist for women wish-
ing to pump. My amendment aims to 
close this gap and equip Congress with 
the data it needs to create meaningful 
solutions. 
We must ensure that women and 
mothers everywhere and from all back-
grounds have the support they deserve 
in the workplace. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
the underlying bill, the PUMP for 
Nursing Mothers Act, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 exposes a 
sweeping, one-size-fits-all mandate on 
businesses of all sizes that is unwork-
able and unreasonable. The bill treats 
all nursing mothers and workplaces as 
if they are the same, despite known dif-
ferences in employees’ needs, industry- 
specific 
challenges, 
and 
employers’ 
abilities to meet the requirements. 
This amendment calls for a Govern-
ment Accountability Office study on 
racial disparities with respect to access 
to workplace accommodations to pump 
breast milk and for GAO to submit rec-
ommendations to Congress—after the 
bill becomes law. 
Madam Speaker, let me be clear, 
crystal clear. I abhor any type of dis-
crimination. There should be no place 
for discrimination in our country, in 
our employment, or anywhere. 
A study of this kind, however, should 
have been commissioned before the 
committee debated far-reaching legis-
lation to impose a flawed mandate on 
all businesses in the United States. In-
stead, H.R. 3110 was rushed to a com-
mittee markup within 2 weeks of intro-
duction. Democrats often put the cart 
before the horse, and this amendment 
does nothing to remedy the short-
comings of this legislation. 
Nursing women are not a monolith. 
They have unique needs that this legis-
lation ignores. H.R. 3110 is reductive 
and, working women deserve better. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD a letter from A 
Better Balance. 
SEPTEMBER 23, 2021. 
Re The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 
3110). 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of A Bet-
ter Balance, I write to express our strong 
support for the PUMP for Nursing Mothers 
Act (‘‘The PUMP Act’’; H.R. 3110) because no 
one in this country should have to choose be-
tween feeding their baby and earning an in-
come for their family. The PUMP Act will 
mean millions of workers, excluded under 
current law, will have adequate break time 
and space to express milk at work. The 
PUMP Act will further the health of our na-
tion’s parents, babies, and economy. Afford-
ing protections to workers so they can pump 
milk to feed this country’s children should 
be a priority for every member of Congress. 
We urge every member to support this bipar-
tisan legislation and vote yes on the PUMP 
Act. 
A Better Balance is a national legal advo-
cacy organization, using the power of the 
law to advance justice for workers, so they 
can care for themselves and their loved ones 
without risking their economic security. We 
founded A Better Balance fifteen years ago 
because we recognized that a lack of fair and 
supportive work-family laws and policies, or 
more broadly, a ‘‘care crisis’’ was harming a 
majority of workers, particularly women, es-
pecially Black and Latina women, in low-

wage jobs. In the case of nursing parents, too 
often, parents return to work without the 
supports they need to continue expressing 
milk at work and are forced to choose be-
tween giving up breastfeeding and maintain-
ing their employment. 
As I shared with the House Education and 
Labor Committee in my March 2021 testi-
mony: 
We hear over and over again on A Better 
Balance’s free legal helpline, new mothers 
returning to the workplace face unfair treat-
ment because their employers refuse to pro-
vide them with the time and space needed to 
express breast milk, forcing them to choose 
between a paycheck and providing breast 
milk for their child. Some workers reduce 
their schedules, are terminated, or are forced 
out of the workplace, foregoing vital income 
and familial economic security because their 
workplaces are so hostile to their need to ex-
press milk. Others simply stop breastfeeding 
altogether, sometimes even before entering 
the workplace, perceiving (typically cor-
rectly) the challenges as insurmountable. 
Too many who continue in their jobs strug-
gle with harassment, health repercussions, 
and dwindling milk supply to feed their ba-
bies. These challenges face many new work-
ing parents, but disproportionately low-wage 
working mothers of color. These harsh work-
place conditions for breastfeeding parents 
represent a fundamental unfairness and in-
equity in our legal system—and reinforce the 
stereotype that motherhood and employ-
ment are irreconcilable. 
One worker who recently called A Better 
Balance’s helpline, Sarah, is a certified 
medication assistant at a large long-term 
care facility in Kansas. Despite having thou-
sands of employees, her employer disparaged 
her and put up roadblock after roadblock 
when she needed to pump at work, telling 
her once ‘‘I gave my baby the bottle—I 
couldn’t imagine having a baby attached to 
me.’’ After her supervisor berated her for 
needing to pump, and she attempted to find 
a space in the office to pump to no avail be-
cause a co-worker walked in, told her to 
‘‘hurry up’’, and refused to leave the room, 
Sarah resorted to pumping in her car just 
once a day. Even then, her supervisor came 
to the parking lot to try and stop her from 
pumping. Because she was only allowed to 
pump once a day, she frequently became 
engorged and suffered painful clogged milk 
ducts. Meanwhile, at least of six Sarah’s co- 
workers took smoke breaks multiple times a 
day without comment or issue. The contrast 
is startling and deeply upsetting. 
Sarah is not alone in her struggle. I also 
shared Izabel’s story with the committee: 
Izabel, a dental assistant in North Caro-
lina, was fired shortly after submitting a 
doctor’s note requesting three 15-minute 
pumping breaks during her shift. Prior to 
submitting the note, she had requested 
pumping breaks and her employer told her 
she could only pump once per day during her 
lunch break—which did not medically meet 
her breastfeeding needs—even though there 
were roughly three other dental assistants 
working in the office who could have helped 
her with her job duties while she took 
breaks. Although likely covered by the 2010 
Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act, be-
cause of the law’s limited enforcement, 
Izabel’s ability to get her job back or be 
made whole were extremely limited. 
BEASTFEEDING HAS MYRIAD BENEFITS FOR PAR-
ENTS & BABIES BUT, AS WE KNOW FIRSTHAND, 
TOO MANY WORKPLACES LACK ADEQUATE PRO-
TECTIONS FOR WORKERS 
Breastfeeding 
is 
increasingly 
common 
among American parents. According to a re-
cent study by the United States Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention survey, more 
than 84 percent of infants born in 2017 were 
breastfed for at least some amount of time. 
The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommend exclusive breastfeeding for about 
6 months, and continuing breastfeeding 
while 
introducing 
complementary 
foods 
until a baby is 12 months old or older. At the 
same time, more than half of working par-
ents return to their jobs before their babies 
are three months old; twenty-five percent of 
workers return within just two weeks of giv-
ing birth. This means that working parents 
who wish to continue breastfeeding will need 
to pump milk on a regular basis upon return-
ing to work in order to continue feeding 
their children and to avoid serious health 
consequences. However, many parents re-
turning to work find it incredibly chal-
lenging to pump because they are not pro-
vided with adequate break time or space to 
do so. This may explain why, although 84 
percent of infants born in 2017 breastfed for 
some period of time, only slightly more than 
58 percent were still breastfeeding at six 
months. 
The health benefits of breastfeeding are 
numerous. As I outlined in my testimony: 
Research shows that breastfeeding has sub-
stantial health benefits for both mothers and 
babies. Breastfeeding protects babies from 
acute illnesses, such as infections and diar-
rhea, which can be serious especially in very 
young and vulnerable babies like those born 
preterm, as well as from longer-term condi-
tions like childhood obesity and asthma. 
Likewise, as Nikia Sankofa, the Executive 
Director of the U.S. Breastfeeding Com-
mittee, made clear in testimony before the 
House Subcommittee on Health, Employ-
ment, Labor, and Pensions and the Sub-
committee on Workforce Protections in Jan-
uary 2020, the health benefits for mothers 
who breastfeed are significant, and include 
lower risk of breast cancer and heart disease. 
Medical consensus urges breastfeeding in-
fants for at least their first year of life in 
order to achieve these health benefits. 
CURRENT FEDERAL LAW LEAVES BEHIND 
MILLIONS OF LACTATING WORKERS 
In 2010, Congress passed the Break Time 
for Nursing Mothers Act as part of the Af-
fordable Care Act. The law amended section 
7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 
U.S.C. 207) and affords workers ‘‘reasonable 
break time for an employee to express breast 
milk for her nursing child for 1 year after 
the child’s birth each time such employee 
has need to express the milk’’ and ‘‘a place, 
other than a bathroom, that is shielded from 
view and free from intrusion from coworkers 
and the public, which may be used by an em-
ployee to express breast milk.’’ 
While groundbreaking, the 2010 law has 
three critical problems: 1) it excludes mil-
lions of workers; 2) it has inadequate rem-
edies for employees whose rights have been 
violated; and 3) it lacks clarity around 
breaks and compensation. 
1. Current law excludes millions of nursing 
parents. The 2010 law is housed in the over-
time provisions of the Fair Labor Standard 
Act (‘‘FLSA’’) which means that those work-
ers exempted from overtime—nearly nine 
million women of childbearing age—are also 
excluded from the law’s protections. These 
millions of workers, including transpor-
tation workers, executive, administrative 
and professional workers, and many others, 
have no federal right requiring their em-
ployer to provide them break time and space 
to express breast milk. As I emphasized in 
my testimony, ‘‘There is no principled rea-
son why these employees should be denied 
the law’s protections: each industry is fully 
capable of standard or innovative solutions 
to ensure their employees do not have to 
choose between breastfeeding and their jobs. 
. . The U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health 
maintains an extensive and detailed website 
describing how various industries, such as 
restaurant and retail, can provide lactation 
break time and space, including video 
testimonials, employer best practices exam-
ples, and other resources. In 2021, there is 
simply no excuse not to meet the needs of 
breastfeeding workers.’’ 
2. Current law has inadequate remedies for 
workers who experienced violations. Given 
the current law’s placement in the overtime 
provisions of the FLSA, the remedy for vio-
lations of the Nursing Mothers law is mis-
aligned. Currently, the available remedy is 
to pay a worker any overtime owed to them. 
As I explained to the Education and Labor 
Committee in March, 
‘‘Such a remedy makes sense in the con-
text of overtime: an employee who works 
forty-five hours in a week without overtime 
pay should be compensated with the missing 
payment 
to 
be 
made 
whole. 
For 
a 
breastfeeding worker who has been denied 
time and space to pump, however, this rem-
edy is nonsensical. A breastfeeding worker 
who is told she cannot clock out to pump has 
been denied an unpaid break. Therefore, she 
has no entitlement to payment and the law’s 
contemplated 
remedy—compensation 
for 
wages—is meaningless to her . . . These 
weak enforcement mechanisms are antithet-
ical 
to 
the 
goal 
of 
ensuring 
that 
breastfeeding workers can get the timely ac-
commodations 
they 
need 
to 
continue 
breastfeeding and keep their jobs’’ 
3. Current law lacks clarity regarding 
pumping breaks and compensation. Under 
current law, pumping breaks that are not 
taken during a paid break do not need to be 
paid. However, often, workers who are pump-
ing may clock out but will still take phone 
calls, emails, or other work requests while 
pumping, and are then denied compensation 
for their time worked while pumping. Be-
cause the language in the law says that 
breaks may be uncompensated, confusion 
persists and violations can occur when em-
ployers continue to require employees to 
work while taking an unpaid pumping break. 
THE PUMP ACT WOULD CLOSE GAPS IN THE LAW, 
PROVIDE
APPROPRIATE
REMEDIES
FOR
EM-
PLOYEES, AND
GIVE
CLARITY
AROUND
COM-
PENSATION. ALTERNATIVE
PROPOSALS
FALL 
WELL SHORT OF THIS GOAL 
The PUMP Act will close the gaps in cur-
rent law and extend the 2010 law’s protec-
tions to nearly nine million employees who 
are currently uncovered, including nurses, 
teachers, and software engineers. Corporate 
leadership, coupled with employees, advo-
cates, and government agencies, have al-
ready devised innovative, affordable, and 
flexible solutions for nearly every workplace 
environment. In addition, the Committee on 
Education & Labor also added language at 
the bill markup requiring the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor to work with the Department 
of Health and Human Services to build out 
guidance for employers. 
The legislation will also provide employers 
additional clarity as to when break time can 
be unpaid, and will provide remedies that are 
already available for other FLSA violations 
if a worker’s rights are violated. At the Edu-
cation & Labor Committee mark-up of the 
bill, the Committee also added language en-
suring fairness for employers by requiring 
employees to inform their employers about 
inadequate space to express breast milk 10 
days before they file suit for violating the re-
quirement. The PUMP Act will benefit work-
ers and business alike, as there are well-rec-
ognized bottom-line benefits for employers

in providing break time and space for lac-
tating employees, such as reduced absentee-
ism, lower healthcare costs, and greater re-
cruitment and retention. This is why the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports this leg-
islation. 
At the Committee markup, the minority 
introduced an Amendment in the Nature of a 
Substitute, and subsequently, a bill which 
mirrored that substitute amendment. Now, 
there is an attempt to include this language 
again as a substitute amendment to this bill. 
Although encouraging to see members voice 
support for break time and space, this sub-
stitute amendment does not afford the pro-
tections that breastfeeding parents need be-
cause it does not address the two main prob-
lems that the PUMP Act is addressing. The 
alternative bill continues to exclude millions 
of workers from break time and space pro-
tections and continues to leave workers with 
no meaningful remedies. Supporting the al-
ternative bill and not the PUMP Act is hol-
low at best and offensive to working parents 
who need real protections. 
The PUMP Act will finally close the gaps 
in the law that have left too many working 
parents without the ability to pump at work 
and thrust into the painful position of choos-
ing between breastfeeding and their job. Con-
gress has the opportunity to right a funda-
mental wrong and pass the PUMP Act. We 
urge you to support nursing parents in a 
meaningful way and pass the PUMP Act. 
Sincerely, 
DINA BAKST, 
Co-Founder & Co-President, 
A Better Balance. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding and for her 
leadership on this important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
the amendment offered by Representa-
tive STRICKLAND from Washington. It is 
sensitive, important, and strengthens 
the bill. It directs the Comptroller 
General to conduct a study on racial 
disparities in breastfeeding and submit 
recommendations to Congress that ad-
dress those disparities. 
As a member of the Black Maternal 
Health Caucus, we are studying dis-
parities in this caucus on healthcare 
and the challenges that some women 
face. 
Breastfeeding contains many health 
benefits for children and for their 
mothers and should be accessible to all 
women no matter what their race, and 
we should study any disparity and try 
to strengthen access and availability. 
This is an excellent amendment, and 
I support the gentlewoman for her 
work and sensitivity. 
Ms. 
STRICKLAND. 
In 
closing, 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment 
that benefits all of us regardless of our 
political affiliation. This is a bipar-
tisan bill, it deserves our support as 
well as the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, let me 
reiterate again: I have no tolerance 
whatsoever for any type of discrimina-
tion in the workplace or anyplace else. 
However, if we are going to do a study 
about 
potential 
discrimination, 
it 
should be done before a bill is drafted, 
introduced, and voted on. 
This amendment does not improve 
the very bad underlying bill, H.R. 3110. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the amendment, vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the underlying bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
The question is on the amendment 
offered 
by 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for next 
week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
my friend, the majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
On Monday, the House will meet at 12 
p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for 
legislative business with votes post-
poned, as usual, until 6:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 
10 a.m. for morning hour and 12 p.m. 
for legislative business. 
And on Wednesday, the House will 
meet at 12 p.m. for legislative business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business. 
Madam Speaker, the House will con-
sider several bills under suspension of 
the rules. The complete list of suspen-
sion bills will be announced by the 
close of business today. 
With the short-term extension of the 
Surface 
Transportation 
Program 
through October 31, the House will aim 
to consider the bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act and the 
Build Back Better Act this work pe-
riod. 
In addition, the House will consider 
H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act of 
2021, sponsored by LUCY
MCBATH
of 
Georgia. That bill modifies and ex-
pands and reauthorizes, through fiscal 
year 2026, the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Program, which 
funds emergency shelters and supports 
related assistance for victims of do-
mestic violence. 
Madam Speaker, if time allows, the 
House may also consider H.R. 3992, the 
Protecting Older Jobs Applicants Act, 
which allows applicants to bring dis-
parate impact claims under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 
1967 when they experience discrimina-
tion while seeking a job. 
Lastly, additional legislative items 
may be possible when and if they are 
ready. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
gentleman. 
As 
we 
go 
through the bills that may come up 
next week—of course, we just finished 
a week bringing some bills to the floor, 
but as we look around the country, 
clearly the main concern we are hear-
ing from families are all of the various 
crises that are facing American fami-
lies. 
You have an inflation crises with 
goods of all kinds costing dramatically 
more when people go to buy things at 
the grocery store. If they try to get a 
new appliance, they are waiting longer, 
they are paying more money. 
You think about the energy crisis 
with families paying 50 percent more 
for gasoline, in some cases, with dra-
matic increases at the pump and the 
pain that it causes, especially lower in-
come families. 
The border crisis, where every day we 
see stories of thousands of people com-
ing across our border illegally. The At-
torney General was before the Com-
mittee 
on 
the 
Judiciary 
and 
he 
couldn’t even give a number of how 
many people have illegally crossed or 
plan to address it. 
The supply chain crisis that we see 
getting worse and worse with ships 
backed up, maybe almost all the way 
to China, because that crisis is not 
being addressed. 
So when you think about all these 
crises that families are angry about—it 
is hurting hardworking families, it is 
costing them, it is taking money out of 
their paychecks—there has not been a 
single bill brought to this floor last 
week. It doesn’t sound like any is being 
brought to the floor next week to ad-
dress any of those crises. 
I would ask the gentleman, would he 
be open to bringing actual legislation 
to the floor to address the various, se-
rious crises that families are facing 
today? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments 
and question. 
Let me say that I mentioned two 
bills that will have a very, very sub-
stantial impact on the welfare of 
Americans, of their families, of their 
health, and yes, even of their environ-
mental security in the Build Back Bet-
ter plan and the BIP plan, which is a 
bipartisan bill on the Senate side. 
I hope to bring both of those bills to 
the floor next week, if they are ready. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have help from 
your side on either of those bills so it 
is more difficult to get unanimity on 
our side of the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, I will tell my friend, 
all those problems that you mentioned, 
would be extraordinarily worse if we 
hadn’t passed the American Rescue 
Plan in March of this year, which 
helped families extraordinarily and 
generously to stay above water. Not a 
single person on your side of the aisle 
voted for those. 
So when the gentleman asked me, are 
we going to bring legislation to the 
floor, we brought it to the floor. You 
all 
opposed 
it, 
however—unfortu-
nately—that helped families, helped 
childcare, helped healthcare, helped 
health workers, helped States all to 
meet the pandemic that this adminis-
tration inherited. 
The pandemic was not the previous 
administration’s fault, obviously, but 
the failure to deal with it effectively 
was their fault. 
So I tell the gentleman that 5 million 
jobs have been created since this ad-
ministration took office. Some people 
lamented the 233,000 jobs last month, 
how awful that was. 
In the best year that Donald Trump 
had, that was his average production of 
jobs—in the best year he had, which 
was from January 2018 to January 2019. 
So I will tell my friend, we hope to be 
able to bring these bills to the floor. 
We think they will have a very sub-
stantial, positive impact. We inherited, 
of course, because of the pandemic— 
again, not the fault of any—well, we 
don’t know whether it was the fault of 
somebody purposely, but in any event, 
for whatever reasons, extraordinary 
amounts of people were laid off around 
the world. 
b 1145 
Then, because of the American Res-
cue Plan, we finally gave some people 
the resources that they could buy 
things that they had needed and want-
ed for them and their families, and now 
we have a supply shortage. 
The President acted through execu-
tive order, as the gentleman knows, to 
make sure that we had a 24/7 operation 
at the ports off Long Beach, off other 
ports in our country, to try to make 
sure that we, A, got goods on those 
ships that you say are to China—I 
don’t know whether they are to China, 
but there are a lot of them; you are ab-
solutely right on that—to get them 
offloaded, to get them on trucks, and 
to get them to where they could be dis-
tributed and available for businesses. 
Then, of course, we have a substan-
tial shortage of chips, which the gen-
tleman knows, which was caused by a 
lockdown for major producers—Singa-
pore being one—of chips. 
So, we are dealing with that. The ex-
ecutive is dealing with that as well. 
I very much hope the gentleman will 
help us get that legislation passed, 
which will make a major difference. 
Who says? Fourteen or 17 laureates 
who wrote to the White House and said 
if these bills passed, it is not only 
going to help jobs, it is not only going 
to help climate, it is not only going to 
help health, but it is also going to help 
bring down inflation, which is a prob-
lem. 
Why do we have inflation? Because 
we have too many dollars chasing too 
few goods, so prices go up. That is true 
of employment as well, which probably 
is good news in terms of salaries going 
up for people around the country. 
I tell my friend that we do have some 
very substantial, important legislation

October 22, 2021 
that we are trying to get done. It would 
be a lot easier to get it done if we had 
help from your side of the aisle. And 
your answer will be, well, it would be 
very helpful if you would take some of 
our ideas. I get that. 
I will also tell you, if the gentleman 
is concerned about all of those issues, 
if we don’t protect the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America, 
they will all get disastrously worse. 
And not one of you is prepared, in a 
debt that we all created, all of us, not 
all on the same thing—it may have 
been 
cutting 
revenues, 
increasing 
spending, this, that, and the other. 
We all essentially voted for very sub-
stantial spending last year to meet the 
crisis of the pandemic. All of us did. 
The CARES Act, the largest of those, 
$2 trillion, was unanimously passed by 
a voice vote in one instance. 
The only thing I would say to the 
gentleman is that we are very, very 
concerned about what is happening. We 
are very glad that we created 5 million 
jobs. Nine million jobs were lost the 
year before under Mr. Trump. He had a 
net loss of 2 million jobs over his 4 
years—a net loss of 2 million jobs. This 
President has a net gain, and we are 
going to try to continue that. I hope we 
get some help from your side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. 
SCALISE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
clearly, we stand ready to help on all of 
those 
issues. 
But 
had 
Washington 
spending and borrowing money solved 
the problem, we would not have any of 
these crises because trillions of dollars 
have been borrowed and spent under 
this administration. 
In the previous administration, we 
worked together on those budget deals, 
every one of them. The Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and the CARES Act 
were all very bipartisan, and it in-
cluded addressing the debt that went 
along with it. 
There has been nothing bipartisan in 
any of the debt that has been racked up 
under this administration. So if the 
gentleman is concerned about the full 
faith and credit of the United States, 
which we all are, then stop borrowing 
and spending trillions more dollars. 
Families get this, by the way. Fami-
lies know that if spending trillions was 
going to solve the problem, there 
wouldn’t be a problem because trillions 
have been borrowed and spent just 
from January to October. What they 
know is it is the very borrowing and 
spending of trillions of dollars in Wash-
ington that has exacerbated these 
problems. 
The inflation crisis would not exist if 
you didn’t have Washington borrowing 
and spending trillions more dollars, 
making it harder for people to get back 
into the workforce, making it harder 
for the supply chain to be addressed. 
What was inherited? I think we know 
what was inherited by the Biden ad-
ministration. We had energy domi-
nance the day President Biden took the 
oath of office. Not only were we pro-
ducing enough energy for our needs, 
but gas was less than $2 a gallon all 
across America. We were exporting oil 
and natural gas to our friends around 
the world. We were undermining our 
enemies around the world. 
Instead of President Biden begging 
OPEC and Russia to produce more oil, 
we were actually shipping oil and gas 
to our friends because we could produce 
enough for ourselves. We created great 
American jobs here at home. We had 
low-cost energy. 
By the way, the technological ad-
vances we made here in this country, if 
there is anywhere in the world where 
fossil fuel production is going to be 
done, you want it done here because we 
have actually lowered carbon emis-
sions. We were lowering carbon emis-
sions in America while producing more 
energy. Now we have become more reli-
ant on OPEC nations, on Russia. 
Not only is that bad for American 
families, but they are paying more at 
the pump because of that crisis created 
by President Biden’s actions. He inher-
ited an energy-dominant Nation. Now 
you have the President of the United 
States begging OPEC and Russia to 
produce more oil, which they are not 
going to do because they want oil to be 
over $80 a barrel, but they actually 
emit more carbon to produce the same 
oil. 
Oil is going to be needed to run an 
economy, any economy anywhere in 
the world. You want to make it here 
because we do it better than anybody 
else. But that is not what is being 
done. We have an answer for it. 
I know, last night, President Biden 
was asked specifically about this crisis 
that he created. His response was, ‘‘I 
don’t have a near-term answer’’ for 
high gas prices. 
Well, President Biden might not have 
an answer, but we do. We have a num-
ber of bills, and I know the gentleman 
has pointed it out. We have a number 
of answers. 
Here is one. H.R. 684 green-lights the 
Keystone pipeline. You want to talk 
about creating thousands of good jobs, 
private-sector 
money, 
more 
energy 
independence for America; this bill 
would do just that, and it would do it 
today. 
If pipelines were a problem—I know 
President Biden doesn’t want American 
pipelines, but he green-lighted the Rus-
sian pipeline, the Nord Stream II. So, 
clearly, it is not pipelines; it is Amer-
ican pipelines he doesn’t want. 
Why don’t we bring up H.R. 684 to 
create jobs and lower energy costs? 
H.R. 543 and H.R. 859 would both green- 
light more production in America that 
President Biden shut down. There was 
production going on all across Amer-
ica, really good, safe, environmentally 
sound production. Again, our standards 
are the best in the world. 
For people who want to bash Amer-
ica, go find a country that produces en-
ergy that does it better than America. 
We do it best. Yet, President Biden, 
through executive action, shut a lot of 
that production down. These bills 
would open that back up again. These 
bills would lower gas prices. 
I know President Biden isn’t inter-
ested in that because, in his own budg-
et, he specifically blocks the Corps of 
Engineers from doing infrastructure 
projects that would lower energy pro-
duction. President Biden blocks that. 
You would think OPEC would have 
come up with that idea or maybe Rus-
sia would have come up with that idea. 
No, that was President Biden in his 
own budget who said you can’t even do 
infrastructure projects if it lowers en-
ergy production. Who would come up 
with that? Yet, that is in his budget. 
Then you go to the border crisis, 
again, self-created. President Biden in-
herited a secure border. A wall was 
being built. You had agreements with 
South American and Central American 
countries. 
Remain in Mexico was a great policy 
that 
President 
Biden 
reversed; 
he 
blocked it. Did he block it because it 
was bad policy? No, it was working 
really well. It was an agreement be-
tween two neighboring countries. He 
just 
blocked 
it 
because 
President 
Trump did it. It was working, yet he 
got rid of it. He could go and reinstate 
that tomorrow. 
We have bills that would solve the 
border crisis. I will read a few of them 
off. 
H.R. 4828 is a bill I brought to the 
majority leader’s attention back a 
month ago, in September. This is a bill 
that deals with a number of problems 
facing our border today, and it would 
give more tools to our Border Patrol 
agents to secure our border. 
H.R. 471 is another bill I brought to 
the gentleman’s attention a month ago 
that would help secure America’s bor-
der, dealing with the crisis. 
None of these bills seem to draw the 
interest of the majority even though 
every one of them would address these 
very real crises facing families that 
were not around a year ago. 
President Biden inherited a secure 
border; he inherited energy dominance; 
and he inherited an economy that was 
recovering from the worst pandemic we 
have seen in lifetimes. Then, on top of 
that, there is a proposal to raise tril-
lions more in taxes, more in Soviet- 
style spending coming out of Wash-
ington 
that 
would 
make 
inflation 
worse. 
The gentleman is correct. We don’t 
support those ideas that would make 
inflation worse, that would raise gas 
prices even higher. But we bring a lot 
of good ideas that would address these 
crises. We just want to see these ideas 
brought to the floor. 
When you look at the floor schedule 
and there is nothing last week, next 
week, a month ago to address any of 
these crises, these are the things that 
families are having the hardest time 
with, and they are struggling. 
Inflation is the biggest tax on lower 
and middle-income families. President 
Biden promised he wouldn’t raise taxes 
on anybody making less than $400,000.

Yet, in the tax proposal that President 
Biden wants to bring forward by next 
week so that he can go fly to Europe 
and talk about other proposals that 
would make it impossible to produce 
energy 
in 
America, 
they 
include, 
among other things, a natural gas tax. 
That tax would fall the hardest on 
lower income families, not the million-
aires and the billionaires. It would be 
people making less than $60,000 that 
would be hit the hardest by a natural 
gas tax. Yet, it is in the bill. 
You talk about adding 83,000 IRS 
agents. Maybe some people in Wash-
ington think that is job creation. Most 
people in America have shivers running 
down their spines at the thought of the 
Federal Government, which now wants 
to track every transaction if they 
make more than $10,000 a year, to 
track all their transactions with 83,000 
new IRS agents. Again, maybe to some 
that is called infrastructure, but to 
most people, it is called a nightmare 
right before Halloween. 
Why don’t we bring bills to the floor 
to address these crises? If these aren’t 
the bills that the majority likes, let’s 
work on some other ones. All of these 
would address these problems, and 
many of them would get us back to the 
point where we were, where we had a 
secure border, where we had energy 
dominance, where we had jobs being 
created. 
Each of these last few months you 
have seen jobs created dramatically 
lower than what the projections were 
because there are all of these self-cre-
ated crises by the administration that 
are making it harder on hardworking 
families. It is the lowest income fami-
lies that are being hit the hardest by 
these failed policies and all the Big 
Government socialist spending coming 
out of Washington. We don’t need 
more. We need to actually go and con-
front the problem that is creating a 
debt crisis and all the other crises that 
families are facing. 
It is not going to be by spending 
more money and taxing people more. It 
is going to be by working to address 
each of them, starting at the root of 
the problem and what created them. I 
yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. I don’t think I can re-
spond, nor do I intend to respond, to 
each one of those assertions. I noticed 
that the gentleman totally ignored the 
facts. 
The 
presentation 
the 
gentleman 
made, Madam Speaker, was as if the 
Republican policies were in place, we 
would be in high cotton. 
Let me remind the gentleman, Don-
ald Trump was President; the Repub-
licans were in the majority, Madam 
Speaker; and over those 4 years, we 
lost a net 2.876 million people from 
jobs. The last 12 months of the Trump 
administration, 9,416,000 jobs were lost. 
Let me remind you, the best year you 
had, you had 2,820,000 new jobs. That is 
about an average of 235,000 jobs a 
month. Last month, when we were all 
wringing our hands because it came 
down substantially from expectations, 
it was 233,000. 
In other words, the wringing of the 
hands over the poor job performance 
you seem to reflect was the average of 
Mr. Trump’s best year. In fact, under 
this administration, helped by a bill, 
the American Rescue Plan, that every 
Republican voted against—what was 
the difference between the first five 
bills that were passed and the bill of 
2021 
that 
every 
Republican 
voted 
against? Donald Trump was President, 
and then Joe Biden was President. 
It is like the debt limit, Madam 
Speaker. They know the debt limit has 
to be raised, or all the things that the 
gentleman just referenced are going to 
be hurt very, very badly. 
Before you start criticizing people for 
not doing things to help, why don’t you 
stop hurting the ability of the United 
States to present a balanced fiscal pos-
ture to our own economy and to the 
rest of the world and have some cer-
titude that America is going to remain 
fiscally responsible and viable and pay 
its bills? I don’t know the answer to 
that question. Perhaps, Madam Speak-
er, the gentleman from Louisiana 
knows. 
b 1200 
The gentleman from Louisiana comes 
from a very important and critical en-
ergy producing State of our Nation. I 
don’t blame him for being concerned 
about energy. He ought to be. We all 
ought to be. But, very frankly, we 
ought to also be very concerned about 
global warming, which the national se-
curity apparatus of the United States 
of America, even during the Trump ad-
ministration, said was one of the big-
gest existential threats to the welfare 
of our people and the global commu-
nity. 
So, yes, we are very concerned about 
reaching an environment which is not 
dangerous for life on this planet. That 
is a very big issue for us. My friend is 
right, and we are going to deal with 
that in the Build Back Better plan. We 
are dealing with it, and we are dealing 
with it in the BIP plan. 
Now, the BIP plan is a plan to spend 
$1.2 trillion on infrastructure invest-
ment over the next 10 years which will 
make our country more competitive, 
will increase our ability to produce 
goods here in America, Make It in 
America, which will make us more 
independent 
and 
self-sufficient. 
We 
found during the pandemic we weren’t 
as self-sufficient as we should be and 
wanted to be. 
These bills that we are considering 
will do that. 
I don’t expect many Republicans to 
vote for it. Even the transportation bill 
that I think they ought to be for—Don-
ald Trump said he was going to spend 
$1 trillion, have a $1 trillion infrastruc-
ture program during his campaign, and 
then we went down to the White House, 
we had a meeting with him, and he 
said: No, $1 trillion is not enough, we 
ought to do $2 trillion. 
He did zero, Madam Speaker, zero 
when the Republicans were in charge. 
Zero. 
We are going to pass this infrastruc-
ture bill, and it is going to make a real 
difference. It is going to make a real 
difference on jobs, it is going to make 
a real difference on inflation, and it is 
going to make a real difference because 
we can increase the supply chain. It is 
going to make a real difference on the 
health of our globe. 
So I tell the gentleman that he raises 
a lot of issues, and I would hope his 
party would start returning to a sense 
of bipartisanship in dealing with legiti-
mate problems that the gentleman 
raises which we did in 2020. 
Now, we did. We were in the minor-
ity. We voted with President Trump. 
Actually, we were in the majority, but 
President Trump was President, and we 
helped support his and the Treasury 
Secretary’s objectives and our own ob-
jectives, and we came to an agreement, 
a bipartisan agreement. 
Very frankly, it is unbelievable to 
me, Madam Speaker, that in the debt 
limit the minority leader of the United 
States Senate—and, very frankly, the 
gentleman just said that we all under-
stand we don’t want to—I presume he 
doesn’t believe we ought to not raise 
our debt limit. I believe he wants us to 
pay our bills because he knows the cat-
astrophic impact if we don’t. But I 
don’t understand why they won’t sup-
port this. That is not an issue of Demo-
crat or Republican. We all created that 
debt in one form or another. Certainly, 
last year we did a big number because 
we thought we needed to meet the pan-
demic. We did, and we saved millions of 
jobs in the process. 
So my friend has these bills, we have 
bills, we are prepared to talk about 
proposals, as I have told my friend in 
the past. But, very frankly, there needs 
to be on some issues—that ought not to 
be political at all, like the debt limit— 
a statement that we are loyal to our 
country, not to Democrats. I said this 
the other day to the gentleman, the 
loyal opposition, not to Democrats, not 
to me as the majority leader, not to 
any of us, but to the country. 
I would implore my friend, because 
we are going to have to do the debt, we 
are going to have to do the omnibus, 
we are going to have to do the debt 
limit, we want to do Build Back Better, 
and we want to do the infrastructure 
bill, those are four pieces of big legisla-
tion we want to do before December 30, 
I am hopeful that we can get some co-
operation from the Republicans. 
I mentioned the debt limit because 
that is an issue that the gentleman 
came to us under the Trump adminis-
tration and asked us to help with. We 
knew it was critical for the interests of 
the country, and on three different oc-
casions we voted with the President at 
the Secretary of the Treasury under 
the Trump administration’s request 
and voted to make sure that America 
did not default on its bills. 
Can I ask if the gentleman will at 
least, Madam Speaker, indicate that

they will support making sure that 
America continues to pay its bills? 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
sure hope that the gentleman is con-
cerned not just about making sure the 
credit card bill is paid but making sure 
that the spending that maxed out the 
credit card is being done responsibly. 
There are some key facts the gen-
tleman left out in his conversation 
about how we got here. We got here be-
cause in January, one party, the Demo-
cratic Party—who is in the majority in 
the House, is in the majority in the 
Senate, and has control in the White 
House—made a decision—I don’t agree 
with the decision—but made a decision 
that they were going to go it alone on 
the spending side. They decided that 
they were going to go max out the 
credit card. We urged them not to do 
it. We still to this day are urging not 
to go and just spend trillions and tril-
lions more dollars. 
If my friend wants to work with us 
on what the responsible decision should 
be, we are right here. We have been 
here from the beginning. 
Madam Speaker, do you know, to 
this day President Biden has not met— 
we are in October, late October. Presi-
dent Biden has not met with the House 
Republican leadership on any of these 
issues—any of them. 
The gentleman referenced a number 
of opportunities where it was described 
we were there to help President Trump. 
The majority wasn’t just there to help 
President Trump, the majority was in 
the meetings when the decisions were 
being made. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
was not a partisan exercise. In fact, it 
was one of the most successful bipar-
tisan exercises I have seen Congress 
come together and do. Everybody was 
in the room making those decisions. 
They were all very important decisions 
and big decisions that involved a lot of 
money, and we all made those decisions 
together. We all voted for those bills 
together, and then, ultimately, the 
spending that went along with it, the 
debt that went along with it was part 
of that negotiation and we voted for it 
together. 
There has not been a decision made 
this year where the majority has nego-
tiated with the minority to figure out 
if we could come to an agreement, so 
the majority did it on their own and 
look, the majority had the votes to do 
it. 
But when the majority maxes out the 
credit card on their own, don’t come 
and chide our side and say: Well, you 
need to be there to pay the bill when 
we weren’t included in the decision to 
max out the credit card. And now that 
the credit card is maxed out, it is not 
as if there is an effort to slow down, in 
fact, it seems like it is full steam 
ahead, damn the torpedoes, spend tril-
lions of dollars more on additional 
things like, again, 83,000 more IRS 
agents. 
Madam Speaker, do you think any-
body on this side supports that? 
That is not something we support. It 
will rack up more debt, by the way. We 
don’t support it, but I guess the gen-
tleman expects we should pay for it 
even if we don’t support it. Maybe if 
there was a negotiation where both 
sides were part of it. 
SAM
GRAVES, who is the ranking 
member of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee, has not been 
included in any of these decisions on 
infrastructure. Yet, I am sure the gen-
tleman would expect him to vote for 
whatever comes out of a partisan exer-
cise. That is not how things work, and 
I know the gentleman knows that. 
Again, if the President wants to work 
with us— 
Mr. HOYER. The gentleman con-
tinues to say facts that are not true. 
Mr. SCALISE. Of course, those are 
true. 
Mr. HOYER. They are not true. 
Mr. SCALISE. We all negotiated on 
the three different debt ceiling in-
creases that happened under the Trump 
administration, including CARES and 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
They were very bipartisan. 
Does the gentleman disagree with 
that? 
Mr. HOYER. I do not disagree with it. 
Mr. SCALISE. Those are the facts. 
And so when the gentleman looked at 
those facts, the gentleman talked 
about jobs and COVID. Before COVID 
happened, we had the hottest economy 
maybe in the history of our country. 
Wages were up for every demographic 
group. Those are facts. The gentleman 
saw small businesses up and women- 
owned small businesses were up over 20 
percent. African-American unemploy-
ment was at its lowest level, Hispanic 
unemployment was at its lowest level, 
and then COVID came along. 
Maybe there is a reason why the ma-
jority won’t hold a hearing on the ori-
gin of COVID, but if the gentleman 
wants to just say because of COVID all 
of that is Donald Trump’s fault, clearly 
the economy shut down, and we worked 
to get it back going again, and it is 
coming back. Frankly, some of the ef-
forts to pay people not to work—and it 
is not just enhanced unemployment, it 
is a whole list of things—are hurting 
the recovery. 
But those things were happening be-
fore COVID hit a year and a half ago, 
and it was because of good, sound poli-
cies that got us a secure border and 
that got us energy dominance, and, 
frankly, it was things like that that 
helped us get the economy going again 
because it was creating good jobs. 
Keystone pipeline was moving for-
ward. Those are good union jobs, by the 
way, and that was ended by President 
Biden unilaterally. He never even tried 
to have a meeting and a conversation 
with us to see if we could come to an 
agreement. 
Again, I guess it is the prerogative of 
the majority. If the gentleman is in the 
majority, then the majority doesn’t 
have to talk to the minority. But just 
because the majority didn’t talk to the 
minority and they made decisions on 
their own about what they wanted to 
do, they didn’t try to reach an agree-
ment with us, to come to us after the 
fact when the majority has spent tril-
lions of dollars, it has wreaked havoc 
through our economy, it has led to in-
flation we haven’t seen in generations 
and gas prices we haven’t seen in dec-
ades, then the majority wants to come 
and not ask us how to fix it—we have 
got ideas on how to fix it—the majority 
asks us to pay the bill. 
Why don’t we work together on the 
front end and not rack up trillions 
more in spending? 
Because the things the gentleman 
talked about would rack up trillions 
more in spending which created these 
problems, and we were not a part of 
those conversations. I wish we were a 
part of the conversations and it was 
done in a bipartisan way. But, again, 
President Biden, 10 months into his ad-
ministration, has yet to sit down and 
meet with House Republican leadership 
to talk about any of these ideas and so-
lutions we could come up with together 
which is how it should be done. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The reason I said he was misstating 
the facts is we have a bipartisan bill. It 
wasn’t done by the Democratic leader-
ship. It, frankly, wasn’t done by the 
Republican leadership. It was done by 
Members of the United States Senate 
on the Republican side and on the 
Democratic side. 
That bill was sent over here with al-
most half of the Republicans in the 
United States Senate voting for it, and 
my friend’s leadership is lobbying 
against that infrastructure bill which 
would help all the issues the gentleman 
raised. 
My friend is urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
that, and he is threatening Members 
who are going to vote for it—maybe 
not very many—because they know it 
is a bipartisan bill. 
Mr. SCALISE. No one is being threat-
ened. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the 
whip is talking about bipartisanship. 
There has been so little bipartisanship, 
and when there is bipartisanship, their 
Members are disciplined. When there is 
bipartisanship on saying that it wasn’t 
a protest, it was an insurrection, there 
was no bipartisanship on that. 
It was a: ‘‘We don’t care what it was. 
We don’t care that some people were 
killed. We don’t really care that they 
were trying to stop the counting of 
votes for the President of the United 
States of America. It was just a pro-
test.’’ 
That is what former President Trump 
said the other day. What a bunch of 
hooey. There clearly has been a con-
scious decision made by the leadership 
on the other side of the aisle, Madam 
Speaker, against a bill that had 69 
votes in the United States Senate. We 
only have 50.

October 22, 2021 
And it is being lobbied against. Why? 
To hurt Joe Biden. 
Yes, they voted, Madam Speaker, for 
the five bills. 
Why? 
Because ultimately Donald Trump 
was for them. Not everybody voted for 
them, but the majority. And as I said, 
CARES, $2 trillion, absolutely essen-
tial, was passed. But the gentleman re-
fuses to answer the question except to 
say: Well, the credit card was maxed 
out. 
The credit card was maxed out by 
date in a couple of those votes which 
we helped as the responsible opposi-
tion, as we did with John Boehner and 
Paul Ryan when they couldn’t get 
votes to pass bills to keep government 
open or to keep the United States from 
defaulting. Yes, we cast the responsible 
vote. 
It is not a popular vote because it is 
demagogued, Madam Speaker. It has 
nothing to do with the debt. The debt 
happens when you pass spending or 
pass revenue cuts. That is what affects 
the debt, and that is what all of us do 
one way or the other. 
So we are all responsible and we 
ought to all be responsible. But the 
Senate leader on the Republican side of 
the aisle has said he is not going to do 
anything. 
Not only will he not do anything, 
Madam Speaker, he will not allow the 
majority to do it on their own because 
he is going to filibuster so it requires 
60 votes. We don’t have 60 votes. We 
have 51. 
b 1215 
Not only will they not do the respon-
sible thing on debt, which would ad-
versely affect, if we do not extend it, 
all the things that the minority whip 
lamented were wrong; it would all be 
adversely affected if, for the first time 
in history, Madam Speaker, we fail to 
extend the debt limit, which, by the 
way, very few countries have—one or 
two—because it is a phony issue. The 
debt is not phony, but the limit is con-
trolled by what budgets we pass, what 
tax cuts we pass, what policies we pass. 
Once we do that, we go in the store, 
or as JIM MCGOVERN, the chair of the 
Rules Committee said, we go in the res-
taurant and buy the steak. You need to 
pay for the steak. The argument, 
Madam Speaker, of, oh, well, you are 
proposing a lot of spending in the fu-
ture, is totally unrelated. The debt 
limit is caused by the debt that we al-
ready incurred. The two bills that we 
had, they don’t affect the debt limit. 
We have met it now, not when we 
passed these bills, not after we make 
that commitment. 
We have a debt limit coming up now 
on December 3, which was totally irre-
sponsible in and of itself, for political 
reasons only, coterminous with the 
funding of government. In 2019, when 
we took over, the government was shut 
down. We spent a lot of time opening it 
up. That hurt the economy. That hurt 
jobs. Now, at that point in time, it 
didn’t hurt inflation. And I have been 
amazed over the years, over the last 10 
years, that we haven’t had more infla-
tion for a number of reasons. 
But he didn’t answer the question, 
whether he would help on that. That is 
not for us. It is not for Democrats, not 
for Republicans. It is for our country. 
It is for our economy. It is for global 
fiscal stability. 
So I would hope at least in that 
area—not for us. I am not asking you 
to do it for me, Madam Speaker. I am 
not asking anybody to do it for me or 
for my party or for the President of the 
United States. MITCH MCCONNELL says 
it is the country and the global com-
munity that could not afford default, 
and that is true. 
Let me tell you, I think that is the 
first step to showing bipartisan respon-
sibility together; not for one another, 
but for our country, Madam Speaker. 
And I hope that at some point in time 
we can show that kind of good faith. 
I included this morning the remarks 
that President George W. Bush made in 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on the kind 
of America that he wanted to see. I 
would hope all of my Republican col-
leagues would read what George W. 
Bush had to say. It is so different from 
the rhetoric of the current leader of 
the Republican Party, Donald Trump, 
in terms of bringing us together as a 
country. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
would be happy to answer the question. 
It might not be the answer the gen-
tleman wants, but I would be happy to 
be part of an actual bipartisan negotia-
tion on how to solve our country’s 
debt. That has not happened. 
But if you look at the bill that the 
gentleman brought to this floor to deal 
with the debt over a month ago, it ab-
solutely dealt with spending, not that 
already happened, but that will happen 
in the future, including the trillions of 
dollars of debt-laden bills that spend 
more money in Washington. 
It picked a date, and the date that 
the gentleman put in the bill that was 
brought to this House floor was Decem-
ber 31, 2022. That is not spending we 
have already done. That is spending 
that the majority plans to do in a very 
partisan way, not just through this 
year but through all of next year. 
When we are not even included in 
those decisions, then you come and 
say, well, you should just be expected 
to pay for whatever we want to spend, 
trillions more, between now and the 
end of a year, over a year from now, 
that is not a negotiation. That is not 
even an attempt to want to work with 
the other side. 
Now, again, the gentleman is in the 
majority. In the Senate, they are in 
the majority, and the gentleman very 
well knows that both sides have the 
ability, if you want to do the spending 
on your own, to address the debt that 
would be created by all of that spend-
ing on your own. It doesn’t take 60 
votes. The gentleman is well aware 
that there is a legislative instrument 
that if all the spending wants to be 
done in a partisan way—and I am talk-
ing about the trillions that are still 
laying in front of us that the gen-
tleman said may come to the floor next 
week, not necessarily will, might come 
to the floor, might come to the floor a 
month from now, might come to the 
floor a year from now. And we won’t 
even be included in those negotiations, 
but we ought to be expected to vote for 
the debt that would be racked up by it? 
If the other side were being asked to 
do that, you know your majority 
wouldn’t go for that. But we wouldn’t 
do it. We would at least include you in 
a negotiation. If we didn’t want to, 
then we would be responsible for doing 
it on our own if we did the spending on 
our own. And the tools are there to do 
just that. 
Threatening to default on the Na-
tion’s debt when legislative instru-
ments are included in this majority to 
not have default is irresponsible. That 
threat keeps being thrown out there by 
the majority, even though the majority 
knows they could, with a majority vote 
in the House and a majority vote in the 
Senate, address the debt that wants to 
be racked up between now and next De-
cember. 
Again, I would urge that all of that 
new spending doesn’t happen, that we 
come together and negotiate what 
budget limits should be like we have 
done in the past under Republican and 
Democrat Presidents. Those were bi-
partisan deals. There has been no bi-
partisan attempt to do that this year. 
Why is there opposition to infra-
structure? Well, first of all, if there 
was a desire to do bipartisan infra-
structure, you are going to find a lot of 
takers over here. I know the gentleman 
made an assertion—probably not real-
izing it—but there would have been no 
threats, no threats made on our side of 
the aisle on a bill. 
Now, I see people being followed into 
bathrooms on the other side and all 
kinds of other things being done. There 
are no threats on this side. What we 
said is, we want an infrastructure ne-
gotiation. But the day that the deal 
was reached in the Senate with the 
President, he turned around about an 
hour later and undermined that deal by 
tying it, linking it, to the tax-and- 
spend bill. 
That is when it became a problem be-
cause taxing and spending trillions 
more dollars would be a problem to 
this country. It would hurt middle- 
class families and lower income fami-
lies to have that natural gas tax, to 
have all the additional inflation on top 
of the inflation they already see. It be-
came a problem for all of those rea-
sons, that package, not the individual 
bill. 
As the President himself has said 
multiple times, as the Speaker herself 
has said multiple times, it is not a 
standalone bill. It is not two stand-
alone bills. It is a package. They are 
married together at the hip. 
That is where the opposition comes 
from. By the way, there is a really

October 22, 2021 
good bipartisan infrastructure bill that 
is out there. S. 3011 came over from the 
Senate unanimously. $500 billion of in-
frastructure is authorized in this bill. 
If the gentleman would bring this up 
for a vote, it would probably fly over-
whelmingly. It would allow for, again, 
about $500 billion immediately that 
could be spent on infrastructure all 
across this country, plus an additional 
large sum next year—maybe $100 bil-
lion next year—on top of the $500 bil-
lion. 
It just passed out of the Senate 
unanimously; every Republican, every 
Democrat supported this bill. This is 
real infrastructure. This is not tied to 
some tax-and-spend bill that maybe the 
gentleman might think is a good idea. 
We surely don’t. We know how dam-
aging it would be to our country and to 
our economy and to middle and lower 
income families. 
This is a very bipartisan bill that 
could be bipartisan here, where we 
could be a part of a negotiation on 
something really good, where States 
wouldn’t have to wait months. They 
have the money ready to go today. 
This gives them the flexibility to make 
their own decisions on what is best for 
the infrastructure in each of these 
States. 
Maryland would be able to control 
their own destiny on over $1 billion. 
Louisiana would be able to control 
their own destiny on over $1 billion 
today if this bill passed. 
So, absolutely, we support real infra-
structure. If it is tied together and 
married to something that would be 
devastating to the economy, of course 
not. Maybe if the majority would look 
at delinking those two and abandoning 
the bill that would raise taxes—and 
even internally in the Democrat Cau-
cus those discussions have been going 
on. That is not just Republicans asking 
for that. There are a number of Demo-
crats asking for that, too. That would 
be a bipartisan initiative to say we are 
jettisoning this idea that we are going 
to raise hundreds of billions, if not 
multiple trillions—whatever the num-
ber—if it is $1 trillion, $5 trillion it 
would be devastating to our economy 
and middle-class families. 
Let’s abandon that and go work on 
something that would actually be real 
infrastructure that we could all rally 
behind. It would pass overwhelmingly. 
It would be good for the country. Presi-
dent Biden would get to sign it into 
law. We would support that. 
I ask the gentleman to look at S. 
3011, and if he is not a supporter of that 
plan that passed with 100 Senators, 
maybe there is a better idea. But this 
one is a really good one that got every 
Republican and every Democrat in the 
Senate earlier this week to say yes. We 
would be happy to say yes to it as well 
if we are given that opportunity. I 
yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
that bill passed the Senate Wednesday, 
so we will look at it, but we haven’t 
had a chance to look at it at this point 
in time. 
I want to get back—and I know this 
sounds like a broken record on the debt 
limit, but the gentleman makes the 
point, Madam Speaker, that somehow 
we have raised the debt to accommo-
date spending. That is what you always 
do because if you reach the debt limit, 
you are done. You stop Social Security. 
You stop veterans’ payments. You stop 
any support payments. You stop paying 
the armed services of the United 
States. That is the spending you stop 
when you can no longer incur debt. 
Why? Because we spent a lot of money. 
We put it on the credit card, and it is 
coming due. It comes due on a regular 
basis, and we have to pay it on a reg-
ular basis. 
The gentleman has voted for bills 
that do exactly what the bill he la-
mented, and none of his colleagues 
voted for, Madam Speaker, exactly 
what he asked us to do, extend it by a 
date, not a number, by a date. Then he 
hypothesizes, well, in that timeframe, 
you are going to incur additional ex-
penses. He is absolutely right. 
So, he is lamenting and giving as a 
reason for his not voting for it is be-
cause there are some proposals to 
spend money in the future. There are 
lots of them from all sides. 
Then he brings up this ‘‘tied to-
gether.’’ Let me tell you who has tied 
it together. The Republican leadership 
has tied these together. Yes, the Presi-
dent talked about it. He said, no, they 
are not tied together. He said, first of 
all, they are tied together, and then he 
said, no, I negotiated this bill; don’t do 
it. 
But I will tell the gentleman, as the 
majority leader who brings bills to the 
floor, their infrastructure bill passed 
overwhelmingly in a bipartisan vote 
and put together in a bipartisan vote 
Republicans, Democrats, and the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Now, he is the President of the 
United States. I know the gentleman 
voted against certifying his election in 
a bipartisan move, I suppose. 
But, Madam Speaker, that bill will 
be brought up separately, and you vote 
for that bill on its merits and vote 
against it on its merits. Do not hide be-
hind the fact that you don’t like some 
other bill. 
Donald Trump said he was going to 
do a trillion dollars on infrastructure 
to help our economy. He didn’t do it. 
Then he said it was going to be $2 tril-
lion. He didn’t do it. Republicans were 
in the majority. They controlled the 
House and the Senate. They didn’t do 
it. 
We have a bill they can vote for. I 
would urge them to vote for extending 
the debt limit so our country meets its 
full faith and credit obligations and for 
the infrastructure bill because I think 
it is a bipartisan bill negotiated by Re-
publicans, by Democrats, and by the 
President of the United States which 
will help our economy and, as I said 
and will reiterate, every issue that the 
gentleman raised, Madam Speaker, in 
his opening remarks. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman again for his 
comments. 
There is clearly a bipartisan bill on 
infrastructure that we would be happy 
to support, S. 3011. Nobody in the 
House on the Republican side was in-
cluded in any of those negotiations, in-
cluding the ranking member of the 
Transportation 
Committee 
who 
he 
himself has been urging a large bill. 
$450 billion was put on the table, 
which, by the way, if that were passed, 
it would be the largest infrastructure 
bill in the history of the United States. 
He was pushed out of the negotiations. 
Again, the majority has that ability 
because they are in the majority, but 
they surely never tried a bipartisan ne-
gotiation, 
as 
well 
the 
gentleman 
knows, on those prior budget agree-
ments. 
It wasn’t just voted for or against be-
cause of who was in the White House. 
It was voted for by both parties be-
cause the negotiation on what that 
spending limit was was agreed upon by 
the leadership of both sides. 
Mr. HOYER. That is not accurate, 
and you know it. 
Mr. SCALISE. The House, Senate, 
Republican, Democrat, we came to 
agreement on those budgets, and that 
is why the gentleman voted for it. That 
is why I voted for it, because it was a 
negotiated agreement. There was give 
and take on a number of items but ulti-
mately agreed by a date certain but 
under a budget agreement. 
b 1230 
There is a date certain of December 
31 of 2022 that has no bipartisan agree-
ment. We know what a lot of the spend-
ing will be, because trillions have al-
ready been spent that we were not in-
cluded in and we strongly opposed. The 
gentleman knew that when he brought 
the bills to the floor, but he wanted to 
bring them to the floor anyway be-
cause you had the votes. I get it. That 
is the way majorities work. 
But if you decide to exclude one 
party from negotiations and go spend 
the money anyway and then have a 
whole list of trillions more in spending 
down the road and include that in a 
bill, I don’t really think anybody ex-
pects the people who were pushed to 
the curb to vote for the credit card 
limit being increased with all the 
spending that is going to continue to 
be racked up—not that has already 
been racked up—that will be racked up 
between now and December 31 of 2022 is 
going to be done in a partisan way. 
That is what the record has been so far 
this year on the trillions that have al-
ready been added by bills passed by 
this majority. They weren’t bipartisan. 
Again, that is the prerogative of the 
majority. 
We have stood here ready. We have 
listed bill after bill to address crisis 
after crisis, none of which have been 
brought to the floor. We are still ready 
to go to solve these problems. We have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5822 
October 22, 2021 
talked about a bipartisan bill on infra-
structure that we can support. Ulti-
mately, the majority makes that deci-
sion. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, if this 
Congress had never met this year, we 
would have to extend the debt limit at 
some point in time this year. That is a 
fact. 
Mr. MCCONNELL has said it is incon-
ceivable that we would not extend the 
debt limit of the United States of 
America and fail our obligation under 
full faith and credit. As a matter of 
fact, the Constitution, in the 14th 
Amendment, says it shall not be ques-
tioned, but we have to take some legis-
lative action. 
The issue is what is our responsi-
bility to the United States of America, 
not all this argument that pretends 
that somehow some bills that are pro-
posed on spending or some that may 
have been passed this year, if they 
hadn’t 
been 
passed, 
somehow 
we 
wouldn’t have to do this. If anybody on 
either side of the aisle believes that to 
be the case, they ought to be defeated 
by their constituents because they 
don’t know what is going on here, on 
either side of the aisle. 
This is a very serious issue with re-
spect to jobs, infrastructure, inflation, 
healthcare, and environment. All of 
those will be adversely affected, and 
the global community itself, if we do 
not extend this debt. We can argue 
about the other issues, but there is no 
argument about this issue. 
Every 
Republican 
President 
has 
asked that this be done. Every Repub-
lican Secretary of the Treasury, since I 
have been in this Congress, 41 years, 
has asked that we extend the debt 
limit; every one of them, without fail. 
Every one of them has said—President 
Reagan on—that if we did not do it, the 
country’s economy, reputation, and 
well-being would be put disastrously at 
risk. 
I don’t want bipartisanship. I want 
patriotism. I want people committed to 
their country and their country’s well- 
being to stand up and say: I am not 
going to demagogue an issue that is so 
critically important to the welfare of 
my Nation. 
I say to the gentleman again: Ex-
actly what they passed when they were 
in the majority, and we voted for it, 
setting a future date—not a number, a 
future date. Exactly. We didn’t ask 
them to do anything more than we did. 
In terms of bipartisanship, I will 
again say: You have got a bipartisan 
bill negotiated in a bipartisan way that 
will be coming to this floor at some 
point in time, I hope earlier rather 
than later, separately—not tied to I 
don’t like this bill, I don’t like that 
bill, I won’t do this, I won’t do that, I 
won’t do the other—which will sub-
stantially grow jobs in our country and 
deal with the climate crisis in our 
country. 
I would ask you to support both of 
those propositions when they come to 
the floor in a show of bipartisan sup-
port for our country, not for each 
other, but for our country. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, we 
need to do this in a bipartisan way, 
which hasn’t happened. But partisan-
ship is not patriotism, and we have 
seen a lot of partisanship. 
I have served in leadership under 
three different Presidents now. When 
we had to negotiate how to come to-
gether on the priorities of our govern-
ment, how to properly fund things and 
deal with our debt, under President 
Obama, we had those bipartisan meet-
ings in the White House. When Presi-
dent Trump came in, we had those bi-
partisan meetings in the White House. 
Still to this day, late October, 10 
months into his Presidency, there has 
not been a single time where President 
Biden has brought a bipartisan group 
of our leadership together. 
I understand he has met with Demo-
crat leadership many times in the 
White House. Again, that is his prerog-
ative. He is the President; you are in 
the majority. If you want to do all of 
this in a partisan way, I don’t suggest 
it is healthy and I don’t suggest it is 
the right way. Every President I have 
served under in leadership has had bi-
partisan meetings to have these con-
versations and come to an agreement. 
That has not happened under this 
President. 
He ought to go and live by the words 
that he promised during the campaign, 
that he would work with both parties 
in a bipartisan way. To not have met 
with House Republican leadership once 
during his Presidency, 10 months in, is 
not an acceptable way to run this gov-
ernment. 
Then all of a sudden, things end up 
partisan, and everybody throws their 
hands up and goes: How did this hap-
pen? Just reach out. He is the Presi-
dent of the United States. If he says 
let’s go tomorrow, we will be there to-
morrow. But he won’t do that. We have 
asked for meetings. At some point they 
have to have them. 
Again, if he doesn’t want them to 
happen, that is his prerogative, because 
the same party controls all levers of 
government. But if the same party con-
trols all levers of government and 
wants to just toss aside the other party 
in either Chamber—oh, we worked with 
Senators. Even some of those Senators 
that were mentioned are not sup-
porting what is happening with debt, 
because there has been no negotiation 
with both parties on the debt, on the 
spending that gets us to the debt. So 
there can be proposals for trillions 
more in spending. If we oppose it, we 
have been very clear why we have that 
opposition. 
It wasn’t us that married those bills 
together. President Biden came here 
just two weeks ago. They said he was 
going to be closing the deal. He was 
going to be the closer. We were going 
to have a vote on the House floor. The 
Speaker promised there would be a 
vote on the House floor. 
Instead, at that meeting, it has been 
reported that he said the two bills are 
tied together. Since then, he said: I 
want both of them coming to me. He 
has tied them together. I wish he 
wouldn’t. That is the President’s pre-
rogative. He has made it very clear. 
The Speaker has made it very clear. It 
has not been our side that has done 
that. We want to separate those as a 
package, but they have been kept to-
gether as a package. Until then, at 
least we have been looking for other 
opportunities, and we found one in S. 
3011 that passed the Senate unani-
mously. That would be $500 billion in 
real infrastructure today. Every Gov-
ernor of every State would have the 
ability to start doing $500 billion in 
new infrastructure projects. We think 
that would be really good for our coun-
try. We support it. We are ready to ne-
gotiate. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this 
needs to come to an end, obviously, but 
I will tell you this, as I stand here, as 
somebody who sat on this floor on Jan-
uary 6 and the question was would the 
House perform its function of accepting 
the electoral college vote to elect this 
President—it wasn’t that there hadn’t 
been voices in the past who had raised 
questions. But there was no effort by 
Ms. Clinton, who received the majority 
of the votes, or Mr. Gore, who received 
the majority of the votes, to raise a 
question about the legitimacy of the 
election. 
But we had an insurrection incited 
by, invited by, and deployed by the 
President of the United States. So we 
didn’t start on a very good bipartisan 
basis, again, not because Republicans 
should have been happy that their can-
didate was not elected or any more 
than we were happy that our candidate 
was not elected in the Clinton and Gore 
campaigns. 
It was, at least, that we ought to up-
hold the constitutional principles. Vice 
President Pence did, and there were 
people in this Capitol on that night 
who wanted to see him, apparently, 
eliminated. That wasn’t a good bipar-
tisan start, Madam Speaker. The ma-
jority of Republicans voted against cer-
tifying the electoral college results in 
State after State. But we ought to put 
that behind us. That is done. What we 
are doing now is we are acting on be-
half of the country. 
The two issues that I dwelt on, be-
cause I think we have agreement on 
that, rhetorically and intellectually 
but not electorally, not in terms of 
voting, is the debt limit should never 
be breached and that we need to invest 
in infrastructure, two simple propo-
sitions. 
The Senate minority leader says: We 
should never breach the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America, 
but I won’t help you do it. I don’t get 
that. Frankly, it seems to be kind of ir-
rational. 
And

pled—as it is and was—and saying let’s 
vote for that. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, we

REMEMBERING SUMMER BARROW 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to speak on the House floor about 
Summer Barrow. 
Summer was born on July 4 and was 
named for the season. Her mother, 
Carey Colvin, said that Summer was a 
firecracker, she was vivacious, she 
loved to dance, she loved to sing, and 
she loved music. But Summer died of a 
fentanyl overdose in January of 2020. 
Summer’s 
substance 
use 
disorder 
began 
after 
she 
was 
prescribed 
oxycodone after a car accident, and 
when the prescription ran out, she 
turned to heroin. 
This vibrant young woman lost her 
life to a substance use disorder, and 
amid her loss, her mother, Carey, has 
turned to advocacy. 
In her honor, I was proud to intro-
duce the bipartisan Support Recovery 
for Addiction Act, legislation that 
would create a guaranteed funding 
stream for recovery support services 
and community organizations. 
Of her daughter, Carey said: ‘‘I know 
what she would want to say is: ‘Please 
get help.’’’ 
This bill would help deliver that help 
to others, just as Summer and so many 
others that we have lost to substance 
use disorder would have wanted.

RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, 
there comes a time to dispel the myth 
that we must choose between women’s 
rights and children’s rights. Now is the 
time because we can protect both. 
Sadly, abortion reveals society’s in-
ability to love, to protect, and to care 
for the most innocent and helpless 
among us. 
When we devalue life, our society suf-
fers. When we deem some to be non-
essential, we devalue their lives. 
I am strongly pro-life, and I consist-
ently stand up for the rights of the un-
born and the born. 
Our society is willing to and does 
care for the mother in need. Perhaps 
she is scared and alone. Americans 
across the country reach out to help 
mothers and the children that they are 
nourishing in their wombs. 
I must rise today to express my grave 
concern that our Democrat colleagues’ 
proposed spending bill lacks crucial 
protections that ensure that taxpayer 
funds do not pay for abortions. 
Without this protection, taxpayer- 
funded abortions not only harm us as a 
society but violate the religious free-
doms of thousands of Americans. 
The longstanding, bipartisan Hyde 
amendment ensures just that, that tax-
payer funds do not go toward abortion. 
However, the Democrats’ currently 
proposed 
multitrillion-dollar 
build 
back broke plan does not contain those 
lifesaving protections. 
In 
1994, 
then-Senator 
Joe 
Biden 
wrote, ‘‘Those of us who are opposed to 
abortion should not be compelled to 
pay for them.’’ 
In God we trust. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT PROVIDES 
CRITICAL SUPPORT TO FAMILIES 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, 7 
months ago, Democrats passed a his-
toric tax cut for middle-class families 
and lifted millions of children out of 
poverty. 
Since then, some of my conservative 
colleagues have had the audacity to 
complain that we helped too many 
children. 
In my district, here is what it means 
when 97 percent of families are eligible 
for the child tax credit: 
For Yvette, it means healthy food on 
the table. 
For Sara, it means being able to af-
ford her child’s preschool tuition. 
This money goes straight into our 
local economy, helping parents get 
back to work and build the future that 
their children deserve. 
But without a clean extension of the 
child tax credit, American families will 
lose this critical support just as the 
economy begins to recover. 
This tax credit isn’t a handout. It is 
about putting hard-earned tax dollars 
back in the pockets of working fami-
lies with children. 
For any of my colleagues who won’t 
vote to help their constituents, let me 
be clear: I will vote for the families in 
your districts and mine because our 
children deserve nothing less.

CONGRATULATING ADMIRAL 
FALLER ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the storied career of Admiral 
Craig Faller, commander of the U.S. 
Southern Command. 
Admiral 
Faller 
is 
a 
native 
of 
Fryburg, Pennsylvania, a small town 
located in Clarion County, in Penn-
sylvania’s 15th Congressional District. 
His naval career started in 1983, fol-
lowing his graduation from the U.S. 
Naval Academy with a degree in sys-
tems engineering. From there, he went 
on to serve during the Gulf war. 
During his service, Admiral Faller 
has held a variety of posts and posi-
tions, from supporting the United Na-
tions’ sanctions against Iraq and the 
humanitarian efforts following the dev-
astating tsunami off Indonesia to sup-
porting Operations New Dawn and En-
during Freedom. His service took him 
all over the world. 
Regardless of location, either on the 
sea or shore, Admiral Faller consist-
ently provided leadership and guid-
ance. 
Admiral Faller currently serves as 
commander of the U.S. Southern Com-
mand and will be retiring from the 
Navy at the end of this month. 
Admiral Faller, thank you for your 
service to the United States of Amer-
ica. Your dedication to our country is 
admirable. Enjoy your retirement. You 
deserve it. 
f 
MAKING AMERICA THE BEST 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it gives me great joy when I can come 
to the floor and really speak directly 
to the moms and dads and families that 
right now, as we stand on the floor, are 
probably looking to gather children 
from schools, looking at what they are 
going to do over the weekend, maybe 
doing grocery shopping and looking at 
the resources that they do have or do 
not have. 
It is important that we immediately 
pass the Build Back Better Act and 
that those who have a difference of 
opinion realize that it is always the 
greater good that America has always 
been about. When we have gone to war, 
we have not gone to war to be an of-
fender. We have gone to war to defend 
principles of democracy. 
I believe the Build Back Better Act 
will provide greater pricing of prescrip-
tion drugs, strengthening the Afford-
able Care Act, expanding Medicaid for 
some 12 States. The State of Texas 
happens to be one of them, where 
733,000-plus people are uninsured. These 
are working people. Expanding Federal 
Medicaid is going to help those people 
in States like Kansas and South Da-
kota. If they won’t speak for them-
selves, I will speak for America. 
In addition, the care economy really 
says that we must give childcare and 
universal kindergarten to people so 
that we can be advanced and our people 
can be helped. 
Finally, let me say that voting is im-
portant and crucial. We must pass vot-
ing rights. 
This is Build Back Better America, 
and build back makes America the best 
country in the world.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
BRAVERY OF CORPORAL DUANE 
E. DEWEY 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Cor-
poral Duane E. Dewey for his service, 
sacrifice, and dedication to our coun-
try. 
Corporal Dewey’s instinctive action 
and bravery saved the lives of a num-
ber of his fellow soldiers and earned 
him the highest military decoration for 
valor, the Medal of Honor. 
He began his service in the Marine 
Corps in 1951 when he enlisted for the 
duration of the Korean war. 
On April 16, 1952, Corporal Dewey and 
his fellow marines were engaged in a 
firefight where they were outnumbered 
more than 20–1. During this fight, Cor-
poral Dewey was wounded in the legs 
by an enemy grenade. While being 
treated for this injury, another grenade 
was thrown within reach. 
At 
a 
moment’s 
notice, 
Corporal 
Dewey grabbed the grenade and lit-
erally sat on it while pulling the medic 
who was treating him onto his body, 
using his body as a shield to save those 
around him. 
Amazingly, although he sustained se-
vere injuries from both grenades and a 
separate additional bullet wound to the 
abdomen, Corporal Dewey survived the 
fight. 
These actions of this great, brave, 
and courageous man earned Corporal 
Dewey the Medal of Honor, which I 
hold here today, his challenge coin. It 
was actually presented by President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower himself, the 
first one that he did personally, who 
notably remarked—accurately, I would 
say—that Corporal Dewey must have a 
‘‘body of steel.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Corporal Dewey is 
the epitome of an American hero. May 
we honor his legacy and never forget 
his selfless actions. 
f 
NO VACCINE MANDATE FOR OUR 
MILITARY 
(Mr. LONG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, in 1886, a 
product was brought online, Coca-Cola, 
and it remained one of the most pop-
ular products of all time until 1985, 99 
years later, when they came out with a 
great idea, New Coke. 
The problem is, New Coke was a ter-
rible idea, and 3 months later, they 
brought back what they call Classic 
Coke because of this terrible, terrible 
idea that had to be fixed. 
Making our military be vaccinated 
against their will is a terrible, terrible 
idea that needs to be fixed. 
Let me be clear. I have been vac-
cinated, and I have encouraged every-
one to talk to their doctors and see if 
the vaccine is right for them. But ulti-
mately, vaccination is a choice that 
shouldn’t be mandated on our fighting 
men and women. 
As of yesterday, 30 percent of our 
total 
force 
remains 
completely 
unvaccinated. Are we prepared to lose 
30 percent of the total force? How do 
we think that is going to impact mili-
tary readiness? The Pentagon, when 
they came out with this program, said 
it was for military readiness. Come on. 
Some branches of the military offer 
waivers for religious reasons, but what 
if a breastfeeding mother isn’t com-
fortable getting the vaccine? I have 
heard from several breastfeeding moth-
ers. 
This needs to be fixed. I ask all my 
colleagues to join me in this effort. 
New Coke is not working. 
f 
NO SPYING ON AVERAGE 
AMERICANS BY IRS 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to express my continued opposition to 
ELIZABETH WARREN and House Demo-
cratic efforts to expand the IRS to spy 
on everyday Americans’ bank accounts 
with transactions over $600. I know 
there has been talk of raising that to 
$10,000. I am opposed to all of this. 
Madam Speaker, the banks already 
have mechanisms in place to catch sus-
picious activity. Those are called SARs 
or specific activity reports. We don’t 
need additional tools by the IRS to 
harass everyday working Americans 
who are struggling to pay their bills. 
If the intention by the Democrats is 
to go after people who are billionaires 
and multimillionaires who are not pay-
ing their taxes, then spying on average 
Americans’ bank accounts with over 
$600 transactions is not going to do it. 
We have to do things in a better way. 
We have to focus the IRS’ time to 
where it is best served, and that is to 
focus on tax cheats, not everyday, av-
erage working Americans. I urge oppo-
sition to this infringement of our 
rights. 
f 
HYDE AMENDMENT SAVES LIVES 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express, once again, my sin-
cere dismay that Democrats continue 
to ignore the wishes of the American 
people by removing the Hyde amend-
ment and other life-affirming protec-
tions for the unborn from their bills, 
including their Big Government, so-
cialist 
tax-and-spend 
reconciliation 
bill. 
My 
constituents 
are 
righteously 
angry that Democrats in control of 
this body time and time again choose 
to violate the sanctity of life. More-
over, they are furious at the thought of 
their tax dollars being used to vio-
lently end the lives of millions of un-
born babies, millions of precious heart-
beats in the womb. 
Madam Speaker, you and I both 
know full well that the Hyde amend-
ment has saved lives. This is not just 
an opinion but a proven fact that sim-
ply cannot be ignored. 
I will always stand in support of the 
Hyde amendment and unapologetically 
fight for the sanctity of life. I urge my 
Democrat colleagues to abandon their 
political charade and restore the Hyde 
amendment in the bipartisan way it 
has been supported for almost 45 years. 
Again, I urge you to restore the Hyde 
amendment. 
f 
DR. FAUCI MUST RESIGN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, any 
trust that Dr. Fauci might have gained 
over the course of the pandemic is now 
completely out the window. He must 
resign and his case be referred for pros-
ecution for perjury. 
For the past year and a half, critical 
decisions for the whole country have 
hinged off of Dr. Fauci’s advice and de-
crees. Two Presidents have used his ad-
vice as the basis for our Nation’s re-
sponse to COVID–19. Yet, here we have 
clear proof that he has been inten-
tionally lying to Congress. 
How can any American trust his 
judgment or that he will tell them the 
truth when he can look Members of 
Congress in the eye and boldly lie 
about the gain-of-function research? 
Dr. Fauci has repeatedly testified in 
the House and Senate that the Na-
tional Institutes of Health did not fund 
research that was gain of function, and 
he had a heated exchange over the spe-
cific claim with Senator RAND PAUL. 
The NIH notified Congress that it 
was aware, as of 2018 and 2020, that 
EcoHealth Alliance did conduct gain- 
of-function research at the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology in China. This re-
search was not allowed under the 
grant’s rules. 
EcoHealth Alliance had also sought a 
grant from DARPA in 2018 but was de-
nied funding because they were worried 
that it might be potentially gain-of- 
function research. 
Dr. Fauci must resign and must be 
prosecuted. 
f 
CRISES IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we 
are living through interesting times. I 
understood that was also a curse, ‘‘May 
you live in interesting times.’’ We cer-
tainly are enduring that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5825 
October 22, 2021 
An article from the New York Post, 
October 18, 2021, is titled ‘‘Biden se-
cretly flying underage migrants into 
NY in dead of night.’’ 
Now, what we have come to see at 
the border in Texas is that this admin-
istration has learned that, gee, we have 
a record number of people pouring into 
this country illegally, but if we can 
ship them away from the border quick-
ly enough, people don’t see them 
amassed by the thousands. So if they 
don’t see them, no harm, no foul. 
b 1300 
I guess they are thinking if no one is 
in the forest to hear a tree fall, does it 
really fall? Well, the truth is, when you 
abandon the rule of law, then a Nation 
based on the rule of law will not last 
much beyond that. 
This is devastating to the country, 
and some would say, well, you know 
what, it is so compassionate to invite 
people. Well, when you hear from doc-
tors that probably 25 percent of the 
women they see have been raped along 
the way, you see children separated 
from their parents in order to come to 
this country to give them a better 
chance of staying in the United States 
so the parents can someday follow, you 
see people that become indentured 
servants of the drug cartels selling 
drugs, sex trafficking, human traf-
ficking, that is not very compas-
sionate. 
It seems the most compassionate 
thing that the United States Govern-
ment could do for our friends and 
neighbors to the south, would be to se-
cure our southern border so nobody 
comes in illegally. That would keep 
out the drugs, the fentanyl, those 
things that are killing 70,000 people a 
year in the United States. 
But the big thing for our neighbors 
would be that the tens of billions of 
dollars pouring across our border to 
the drug cartels that allows them to 
corrupt every level of Mexican Govern-
ment would stop and people wouldn’t 
have to live in fear of the drug cartels 
controlling Mexico, controlling coun-
tries to the south. That would be the 
compassionate thing to do. 
I yield to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
There are so many crises in this 
country right now. While many of us 
recognize that this President was a 
hard left radical, probably most of us 
underestimated the speed and the ef-
fectiveness with which he could ruin 
just about every situation, every issue 
in our country. 
It is hard, therefore, to identify what 
is the greatest threat to the country 
right now, what is the greatest crisis 
that faces our country right now—with 
no hope on the horizon, by the way, for 
any of them to get better under this 
administration; whether it is the vac-
cine mandates, things we couldn’t 
imagine just a year or two ago. 
When this President ran for office, he 
said he wouldn’t issue a vaccine man-
date if he would win, and now we see 
today where people are being laid off. 
Those who were heroes over the last 
year and a half are now zeros and are 
getting fired from their jobs. Those 
who kept us safe on a daily basis, the 
first responders, the healthcare work-
ers, our military. So is it the vaccine 
mandates? 
Is it the out-of-control reckless, irre-
sponsible, unprecedented spending that 
we see? I mean, we already have 28, $29 
trillion worth of debt, which is some 80 
to $90,000 per American and yet, we 
find ourselves today with the majority 
party trying to determine how they 
can come together for another 5, $6 
trillion, whatever the amount might 
be. Is it the spending? 
Is it our education system? Whether 
it is the product that we are not get-
ting with how much we spend on edu-
cation, the Federal mandates, the in-
trusion into local and State education. 
Whether it is the teaching of CRT or 
that sort of philosophy where there is 
transgender 
policy. 
Whether 
it 
is 
masks and vaccines on children, which 
as others have submitted—and I would 
agree—is child abuse with no dem-
onstrated 
medical 
justification 
for 
masks on children or vaccines for 
young adults who are at almost no risk 
from COVID. 
Are those the greatest issues? 
Is it foreign policy? We have got 
China saber-rattling, shooting off mis-
siles. We have the debacle in Afghani-
stan. North Korea, Iran, and Russia 
certainly have no reason to fear us 
under this President. 
Is it the 30 percent rise in violent 
crime while our police are at threat of 
their funding being reduced or they are 
being undermined and harassed? They 
are told to stand down in the face of 
looting and violence in their cities. 
Is it massive inflation? The hidden 
tax on every American, where their 
savings, their hard-earned resources, 
are being depleted by too many dollars 
chasing too few goods? 
Is it the breakdown of the supply 
chain and what that is going to mean 
in the coming months ahead? 
Is it our declaring war on American 
energy, forcing us to again depend on 
foreign provision from hostile nations 
for our energy; the jobs that are lost in 
that? The higher gas prices? 
But I submit to your point, Congress-
man GOHMERT, immigration, illegal 
immigration, and the invasion, the ab-
solute invasion at our southern border 
may be the biggest crisis. 
As you know well, the Constitution 
says in Article IV, Section 4: It is the 
responsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment to protect the States from inva-
sion, and that is clearly not happening. 
And I submit, as we talk about this 
issue, never in the history of our coun-
try has our own President inten-
tionally done more to harm the Nation 
than what this President has done with 
the invasion at our southern border. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
couldn’t agree more. And it is not com-
passionate to lure people, lure children 
into this country away from their par-
ents with some hope down the road 
maybe they get back together. That is 
not compassionate when you lure peo-
ple to their detriment. 
In fact, if the U.S. Government were 
susceptible to being sued by people 
that have been lured into the country 
to their detriment and by the open bor-
der policy that ends up causing them 
to be basically, totally under the con-
trol of the drug cartels, then there 
would be attractive nuisance lawsuits 
against this President and against our 
Federal Government for not securing 
our border and drawing people in who 
are then harmed. 
There are constantly people being 
found that are dead that tried to make 
it in, and yet, the drug cartels being so 
heartless, they don’t care if they die or 
not. But they do want to continue to 
add employees or indentured servants 
all over the country. 
It is just rather dramatic how this 
President, this administration is doing 
so much to aid and abet the drug car-
tels in getting their servants all over 
the country in cities and, yet, it is true 
we have Americans that are paying for 
the drugs, paying for sex trafficking, 
and we should be doing so much more 
as a Federal Government to prevent 
those things from happening. 
There is an article here from Politico 
of all places: ‘‘It’s not just Repub-
licans. Everyone’s mad at Biden over 
migration.’’ 
You have got Daily Mail from Octo-
ber 20: ‘‘Facebook admits users can 
share information on illegal immigra-
tion and being smuggled: Arizona At-
torney General calls for investigation 
into tech giant for ‘facilitating human 
and sex trafficking.’’’ 
So, once again, just like with our 
elections, you have got the Democrats 
in positions of power in the govern-
ment working hand in hand with the 
tech giants for something that is just 
terrible for human beings, and that is 
facilitating human and sex trafficking. 
Mr. GOOD. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. This is the 
greatest country in the world, as you 
know, Congressman GOHMERT. There is 
a reason why people from all over the 
world want to come to the United 
States. Never in the history of the 
world has a nation been more wel-
coming to immigrants, to people from 
all corners of the globe who are seeking 
a better life, seeking freedom. No na-
tion in the history of the world has 
given more opportunity to people of all 
backgrounds, all ethnicities, all na-
tionalities who come here legally seek-
ing to join us, to strengthen us as a na-
tion, to make us a stronger nation, a 
more perfect Union, people from all re-
ligions, 
all 
faiths, 
all 
races, 
all 
ethnicities 
seeking 
desperately 
to 
come to the United States of America, 
a country that is under assault for who 
it is as a nation by those on the left, by

October 22, 2021 
those on the other side of the aisle who 
condemn this country and want to 
change and transform this country into 
that from which these people are flee-
ing. 
I had a reporter say to me once, well, 
there is not an easy fix here to the im-
migration situation. And I said, well, it 
may not be easy, but it is simple: All 
we have to do is go back to the policies 
that were working a year ago that had 
largely defeated illegal immigration at 
our southern border. 
We know that walls work. I have had 
the privilege of going to the border 
three times, twice to Arizona and once 
to Texas, in my first nearly 10 months 
here serving in this Congress, some-
thing that apparently our President 
has never done, and our Vice President 
has certainly never done during her 
time as the ‘‘border czar.’’ 
But as I went and saw firsthand for 
the first time in my life—I had driven 
past the border previously just from a 
car and I could see the meager fence 
that was there before the previous 
President, but I had never actually got-
ten out and visited and walked and 
talked with the people who live there, 
the people who are subjected to this il-
legal invasion, these folks, some of 
which are very dangerous, but all of 
which are coming very desperately for 
different reasons, coming on their 
property, vandalizing, invading, threat-
ening, and in some cases, harming. 
I met with a rancher family who had 
a family member killed by an illegal 
alien. But meeting with ranchers, law 
enforcement officials, border patrol, 
those on the frontlines living with and 
then also working as best as they can 
under 
this 
administration—frankly, 
against this administration—to try to 
do what they can to deal with the bor-
der crisis. 
Walls do work. The enforcement that 
we had in place a year ago was work-
ing, ending catch and release, estab-
lishing MPP—the remain in Mexico 
policy—turning folks away through 
Title 42 policies. We were on the way to 
fixing our illegal immigration situa-
tion. 
But 
this 
administration 
with 
complicit help and support from this 
Democrat majority in this Congress is 
not just neglecting our southern bor-
der, not just failing to fix our broken 
illegal immigration situation, but they 
are part and parcel complicit and in-
tentional in facilitating this invasion, 
and as you know all too well, as you 
have already touched on, hiding it from 
the American people as they do it. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, as 
my friend has noted, there are so many 
crises that are going on right now. We 
have the economy being harmed even 
more by policies of this administration 
with the President and all of those 
working with him and for him demand-
ing that everyone be vaccinated. 
And the President himself has said 
we need to protect the vaccinated from 
the unvaccinated, and he said the way 
to do that is to make sure all the 
unvaccinated are vaccinated. 
So this administration’s solution is 
we have got to protect the vaccinated 
from the unvaccinated by making the 
unvaccinated get the vaccination. That 
does 
not 
protect 
you 
from 
the 
unvaccinated. It makes no sense. 
b 1315 
And some doctors have said, if some-
body put out a vaccine that killed 200 
people, they would immediately slam 
the brakes and say, Whoa, wait, let’s 
hold up. We have got to find out what 
the problem is here. But we know from 
reports that have been made that there 
are people that have died from having 
the vaccination. 
We are thrilled that the vaccines 
were produced so quickly. President 
Trump got a lot of the red tape out of 
the way. However, it ought to be a 
choice after talking, between a doctor 
and a patient, and the doctor under-
standing the risks inherent because of 
the biological makeup of this person 
for taking the vaccination, and then 
let the individual decide. 
But if the vaccination works as good 
as we were told originally it did, then 
there should be no vaccinated person 
really concerned about those that are 
unvaccinated because they would be 
protected. 
I am glad that the administration is 
starting to have cracks in their ada-
mant position that having had COVID 
and having antibodies is just not near-
ly as good as having a vaccination. I 
am glad they are starting to—some of 
them at least—observe the science, 
that it is probably a little better if you 
had COVID, had the antibodies, as far 
as your future and fighting it off. So I 
am encouraged by that. 
But then, I see this article from Oc-
tober 19. As we talked about before, the 
President, I believe, he is doing some-
thing illegal in saying you have got to 
have the vaccination. And then he 
comes out and says, we are going to 
have OSHA put together a rule requir-
ing everybody to have the vaccination. 
But the President, himself, does not 
sign an executive order, which could be 
taken to court. It is just the general 
policy of blackmailing companies, pri-
vate firms, that we are coming after 
you if you don’t force your employees 
to have the vaccination. It is really a 
bit insidious. You don’t even really 
give people a chance to file suit. You 
just state a policy you are going to fol-
low and then have everybody follow it, 
it makes it much more difficult to sue. 
But this article says, ‘‘OSHA will not 
enforce 29 CFR 1904’s recording require-
ments to require any employers to 
record worker side effects from COVID– 
19 vaccination.’’ The Biden administra-
tion is forcing you to take the jab in 
order to work. And simultaneously, the 
Biden administration does not want 
the employer to tell them about work-
ers who were injured by the jab. Sim-
ply more evidence that the vaccine 
mandate is not about your health. 
So that is a little disturbing. You 
would think if anyone cared about 
science and really cared about people, 
you would want to know about every 
abnormality, 
every 
adverse 
con-
sequence of taking the vaccination, be-
cause we are really concerned about in-
dividual health. But that is not this ad-
ministration. They are putting out 
that we don’t want to know things that 
are bad. 
I was informed about a person that 
had the vaccination, and immediately 
died after the vaccination; was full of 
blood clots—not one, but many. And 
the physician noted the cause of death 
was blood clots from a vaccination. 
And then the family was told the 
health official will not certify a death 
certificate if it blames the vaccination 
for the death. 
So the widow is in a real bind be-
cause you have got to have a death cer-
tificate in order to legally move for-
ward and get things changed after the 
person died. You got to show proof. 
And yet, the health officer refusing to 
attribute the cause of death to what it 
really was, according to the doctor, the 
vaccination. 
So that is pretty remarkable that the 
government does not want to do its job 
in protecting people. I would think 
that if someone in government really 
cared about people instead of caring 
about being a dictator, they would say, 
We want to know exactly what hap-
pened after a vaccination that went 
wrong and which vaccine was it so we 
can document which ones are safer 
than other vaccinations. But that is 
not, apparently, what is going on in 
this country right now. 
So we really need people stepping up 
and letting this administration know, 
letting their Members of Congress, 
their Senators know that they expect 
them to speak up. We want complete 
transparency. 
What 
works; 
what 
doesn’t work. We don’t want the gov-
ernment hiding things from us any-
more. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, once again, I’ll say how privileged 
we are to be among the some 5 percent 
of the world’s population that gets to 
live here, in spite of all the things that 
we are battling through and we are 
struggling through as a Nation, the cri-
ses we are facing, the tyranny of this 
current regime that is leading us. 
Our first President, who I believe was 
our greatest President, I believe di-
vinely inspired, appointed by God to be 
that first President for the United 
States, who would not be king, refused 
to be king. And instead, we find our-
selves today with one who seemingly 
would be king, if he could; or thinks 
that he is king, it seems, by actions. 
In a free country, which we still are, 
to some degree—— 
Mr. GOHMERT. To some degree. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. To some de-
gree, it is not the government’s role to 
protect us from ourselves. We choose, 
in a free society, to endure or be ex-
posed to some risks for our precious

freedoms. We are a Nation of the peo-
ple, by the people, for the people. A Na-
tion whose founding documents pro-
claim our God-given right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit—not the govern-
ment provided—but the pursuit of hap-
piness. 
And here we find ourselves today, 
something we could almost not have 
imagined even a year or two ago, where 
our most precious, most basic of free-
doms, have been under threat, under 
assault, or worse, stripping away from 
us in the name of a pandemic, in the 
name of an emergency. 
The American people should make no 
mistake, that COVID policy needs to be 
viewed through a long-term lens. There 
is no such thing as a one-time excep-
tion. What we will endure or accept or 
submit to today becomes the pattern, 
the model for the future. 
And, again, our most basic freedoms 
we have seen are freedom of movement, 
where we can go; our freedom of assem-
bly, who we can be with; our freedom 
to work and to provide for ourselves 
and our family, to open our business, 
to frequent a business, to worship. And 
then the most basic of freedoms of all— 
our freedom of our person. That we 
now have a President, again, who a 
year ago, because he would not have 
gotten elected otherwise, said he would 
not enforce a vaccine mandate, later 
said he did not have the authority to 
enforce a vaccine mandate. And you 
know better than I, constitutionally, 
has no authority to enforce this vac-
cine mandate. 
Setting aside whether or not it is 
helpful or justified medically, just 
speaking legally and constitutionally, 
the Federal Government has no author-
ity to do this. Certainly, the executive 
does not have the authority to act like 
a king and do this. And certainly, he 
does not have the authority to compel 
businesses to do that which he does not 
have the authority to do. 
And yet, we see a total disregard. 
This was a President that ran as the 
uniter in chief, and instead, he is the 
divider in chief, separating and divid-
ing people based on vaccine status. De-
manding that people disclose their 
most basic of personal information, 
whether or not they have received a 
vaccine, and then under threat of pen-
alty of their job and worse, not be able 
to, again, go where they want to go and 
do what they want to do, if they don’t 
comply with the heavy hand of the 
Federal Government. 
And in this terrible, terrible spending 
package, which is not just the trillions 
of dollars, but it is what is in it, one of 
many, many terrible things in it that 
the American people need to know 
about it is making the penalty for a 
business that doesn’t comply with this 
vaccine mandate up to $700,000 dollars 
per occurrence. 
And to your point, what a shame, 
what a travesty that our own govern-
ment is lying to us about COVID and 
about the vaccine. Here, we know that 
medicine and science is supposed to be 
challenged. It is supposed to be de-
bated. It is supposed to be learned 
from. We don’t want the same medicine 
from yesteryear. We want the very best 
from today, that we don’t just hold on 
to what was before. We get a medical 
diagnose that is troubling, we get a 
second opinion; we consult with more 
than one person. We learn. We estab-
lish the evidence. 
But as you know, this government, 
this Federal Government, this execu-
tive 
administration, 
with 
their 
complicit allies in the media and in Big 
Tech, shuts down any dissent—to your 
point—on the stated narrative, the ap-
proved narrative, no matter how many 
times over the doctor in chief, the ce-
lebrity doctor in chief is proved wrong 
or contradictory—whether it is on gain 
of function or whatever it might be— 
any dissent is shut down on the risks of 
the vaccine. And there are risks. 
And 
some 
people 
understandably 
make the decision that for them, be-
cause of their health, because of their 
youth, because of their exposure, or be-
cause they have natural immunity be-
cause they have already had COVID, or 
the religious reasons or whatever it 
might be, they decide they don’t want 
to have the vaccine. And this govern-
ment and their complicit allies that we 
have already mentioned, are lying to 
us that there are risks to the vaccine. 
They obviously have been lying to us 
about the efficacy of the vaccine, be-
cause as you made the great point, we 
are going to force the unvaccinated to 
get the vaccine that doesn’t protect 
the vaccinated from the unvaccinated. 
They are lying to us about the efficacy 
of masks. 
As you know, what we are forced to 
wear in this Chamber when we are not 
speaking at the lectern, pretending 
that a cloth mask makes a difference. 
There is medical documentation for 
that, which there is very little conclu-
sive evidence to that effect, as you 
know. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Yes, I yield to 
the gentleman. 
Mr. GOHMERT. I did read results of 
one study that indicated that if you 
wear a mask, you are two-tenths of one 
percent less likely to get COVID. So 
there is that. There is at least two- 
tenths of one percent that it is appar-
ently helpful but we don’t know the re-
sults of long-term wearing a mask, the 
additional CO2 that may be taken in, or 
germs that are kept in a mask that 
would have not been breathed in re-
peatedly. We don’t know the results of 
all that. 
That is fine, but that is still very dif-
ferent from forcing someone to have an 
injection, which we know can have 
very adverse effects. And that is why it 
ought to be an individual decision to 
make. 
b 1330 
But then again, it also contributes to 
a crisis in enough people doing jobs 
that allow us to have a supply chain 
that is intact and getting people the 
things that they need. 
Little did I know—you may have an-
ticipated it—but there were people 
making jokes after the Vice President 
had said several weeks ago—it may 
have been in August—that people need-
ed to get their orders in now so they 
would get things by Christmas. Wow. 
Apparently, they saw this coming. 
But the point that has been made by 
my friend about the various opinions 
from the same people, when it comes to 
Dr. Fauci, when it comes to the Presi-
dent, it is hard to find an issue that 
they haven’t been on more than one 
side of. 
Fauci would say, no, don’t use a 
mask. Yes, you should use a mask. And 
then he says, use a mask. And then he 
is saying at a baseball game you do not 
need to wear a mask, not social dis-
tance. 
He has given different opinions, and 
it reminded me of Winston Churchill’s 
comment about Keynes, the economist. 
Of course, a lot of people say that is 
Keynesian economics. But if you look 
back and do some research on the guy, 
often when he got into debate and was 
confronted that some theory he had 
wasn’t true and didn’t work, he would 
immediately take the other position 
and say he was not for that, he was for 
this. 
So Winston Churchill had once said— 
I believe this is close to verbatim. He 
said if you put two economists in a 
room, you would have three different 
opinions unless one of them was Sir 
Keynes, in which case you would have 
an unlimited number of opinions. I am 
getting 
that 
impression 
from 
Dr. 
Fauci. 
Apparently, even Dr. Fauci needs to 
come to grips with the fact that when 
he says the U.S. never funded any gain- 
of-function research—okay, the evi-
dence is there. He had us going for a 
while, but the evidence is in, and that 
is absolutely not true. 
Hopefully, in all the myriad of opin-
ions he has, he will come around and 
find the truthful opinion when it comes 
to his group contributing to gain-of- 
function 
research 
that 
helped 
weaponize the COVID virus. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
this 
administration, 
this 
executive 
branch of government, as you said, is 
weaponizing its agencies, its depart-
ments, its resources against the Amer-
ican people. 
On the COVID vaccine mandate that 
you were mentioning, what greater 
weapon can we use than to strip folks 
of their ability to earn a living? But it 
is part and parcel with this govern-
ment, this administration, this Presi-
dential regime which believes that the 
greatest threat to America is Ameri-
cans, conservatives, patriots, those 
who vote the wrong way, as they see it, 
those who might have supported the 
previous President, those who show up 
to school board meetings, those who 
don’t get a vaccine that they say you 
have to receive.

They are weaponizing the IRS. Here 
in this budget that they want to ap-
prove, the trillions of dollars, they 
want to hire some 85,000 more IRS 
agents so they can be more effective in 
their assault on the American people. 
Here we are turning the Federal Gov-
ernment against parents who show up 
at school board meetings to express 
their concern for their children or what 
is being taught in their schools, which 
they have to pay for, by the way, that 
they have to fund. 
You see that this administration 
looks with contempt upon the Amer-
ican people, with contempt upon our 
law enforcement and first responders, 
with contempt upon our military. They 
have told our military that the great-
est threat to the country, in addition 
to climate, is white supremacy in the 
military, racism in the military. We 
see the CRT forced upon our military, 
while we have the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs saying he wants to under-
stand what white rage is. 
I would like for him to understand 
what China is doing, what is going on 
in Afghanistan, what is up with North 
Korea, what is up with Iran, what is up 
with Afghanistan. Instead, they are fo-
cused on weaponizing the Federal Gov-
ernment 
and 
all 
of 
its 
resources 
against our very citizens. 
Mr. GOHMERT. My friend has such a 
great point. To have the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States jump into the 
issue of disagreements at school board 
meetings is absolutely astounding. We 
have record crime, especially in cities 
controlled totally by Democrats. Crime 
is going up tremendously. 
I know that Merrick Garland knows 
the Constitution, or at least he has at 
one time. He knows that there is no 
mention in the Constitution of a Fed-
eral role in education. Yet, he sends 
out a memo saying—basically, it is 
pretty intimidating—that we are going 
to start digging into these school board 
meetings and using the Justice Depart-
ment to go after people who have dif-
ferences of agreement that happen to 
agree with Dr. King that people should 
be judged by the content of their char-
acter and not by the color of their 
skin. 
Who would have believed that 40 to 50 
years after it seemed we were so close 
to Dr. King’s dream being realized that 
you would have an administration to-
tally committed to undoing Dr. King’s 
dream and going back to judging peo-
ple by the color of their skin instead of 
the content of their character? It is 
just shocking. 
Of course, the saying in Washington 
is and has been for many years, no 
matter how cynical you are, it is never 
enough to catch up. Well, we find out, 
after Attorney General Garland sends 
out the letter that he is going to go 
after these people that are in disagree-
ment, lo and behold, it turns out his 
son-in-law and daughter make a tre-
mendous amount of money selling 
things in support of critical race the-
ory, judging people by the color of 
their skin and not by the content of 
their character. 
It is Panorama Education Company 
founded by Xan Tanner. They sell sur-
veys to school districts, according to 
this article from Callie Patteson, that 
has a nationwide focus on ‘‘social and 
emotion climate,’’ which is interesting. 
I guess they are wanting that climate 
changed as well. 
With contracts in more than 50 of the 
100 largest school districts in the U.S., 
Panorama Education claims to be sup-
porting ‘‘13 million students in 23,000 
schools and 1,500 districts across 50 
States.’’ Panorama Education Com-
pany’s cofounder Xan Tanner is Attor-
ney General Merrick Garland’s son-in- 
law. 
It then goes on to talk about the 21 
different States where they are spread-
ing this stuff. Their surveys reportedly 
give justification for new curricula in 
schools, which parents have recently 
taken issue with, such as critical race 
theory. 
But since 2017, the company has 
raised $76 million from investors. Just 
last 
month, 
Panorama 
Education 
struck a $60 million private financing 
raise with General Atlantic. 
It is rather amazing. Just when you 
think you can’t get more cynical about 
what this administration is doing, we 
find out, gee, there is pecuniary gain 
afoot here on this issue of the Attorney 
General weighing in on school board 
meetings. Of course, that is kind of fly-
ing in the face of the idea that white 
supremacy and climate change are the 
two biggest dangers to America. 
For those of us that had incredibly 
good constitutional law professors, we 
know 
those 
professors 
would 
say: 
Where is the Federal nexus? There has 
to be some Federal reason, something 
that gives the Federal Government the 
right to come in and control school 
board meetings. 
Of course, shortly after I got here, I 
had a law that I was working on. Hav-
ing family involved in schools—my 
mother was a schoolteacher—I know 
back then the administrators had the 
teachers’ backs. But now, because of so 
many lawsuits so easily and quickly 
filed, administrators would say things 
to teachers like: Look, I realize this 
student is a total disruption to your 
class, but his mother or father, or both, 
will file lawsuits, and we don’t need a 
lawsuit, so just do the best you can. 
And that would disrupt the education 
of other students. 
My thought was, as a judge, I had 
what was called judicial immunity. 
You might not like my rulings, but you 
can’t just sue because you don’t like 
the rulings. It was judicial immunity. I 
thought, what if we created an edu-
cational immunity? You may not like 
what a school does, or a teacher or 
principal, but unless they have com-
mitted a crime, you can’t sue them. 
That would allow things to get to the 
place where they used to be. 
When I was growing up, if you had a 
problem with a teacher or some issue 
in the school, you went to the school 
board 
meetings—like 
the 
Attorney 
General is trying to stop now. If some-
body on the school board or too many 
on the school board didn’t see it as a 
problem, then you ran for the school 
board, got elected, and fixed it. 
But because of lawsuits, that has to-
tally changed the way schools have had 
to approach things. So what if we gave 
them educational immunity? I had 
asked the national education folks. 
They came and I made the presen-
tation, and I was totally shocked when 
they said: We are not sure that we 
could support that. I said, but it would 
keep your teachers from being sued at 
the drop of a hat. People could go com-
plain to the school board, but you 
couldn’t just go after a teacher. 
Well, it turns out, they eventually 
got back to me and said they wouldn’t 
be able to support that bill. I was just 
mortified—mystified, too. Why would 
they not be behind that? 
b 1345 
Then one of my friends who spent his 
life in education said, Louie, do you 
not understand the biggest cash cow, 
the biggest moneymaker for the teach-
ers unions, is liability insurance? 
If you take away their liability, then 
the teachers unions can’t sell and 
make money off of liability insurance. 
There goes that big cash cow. 
Yes, it would make life easier for 
teachers, but the unions, the people 
who are making money from union-
izing teachers, will not ever support 
something like that. 
So, just, again, going back to the old 
adage: No matter how cynical you get 
around here, it is not enough to catch 
up. I am constantly being reeducated 
on that issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend 
from Virginia. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman GOHMERT for al-
lowing me to participate with him. 
The final thing that I will add is we 
certainly have agreement and recogni-
tion, as I think most Americans do, 
that we have surrendered control of K– 
12 through college of our education sys-
tem to the hard left radicals, and it is 
refreshing to see parents engaged and 
parents standing up and saying that 
this is not what they are paying for 
and this is not what they are going to 
stand for. 
That is the silver lining of the pan-
demic, as more parents became aware 
of it. 
I will make one more reference to my 
final words here on the spending pack-
age that is being debated by the major-
ity as they are trying to come to an 
agreement to bring it to the floor for a 
vote. 
It would take it a step further, as my 
friend knows, it would take it to not 
only free community college, which is 
a step toward free college and probably 
eliminating 
faith-based 
institutions 
that wouldn’t be eligible for the free 
college, by the way—the marketplace

would probably eliminate them as fam-
ilies chose the free public education— 
but it would take it to the preschool 
and the childcare that is now proposed 
to be free. Faith-based institutions 
would not be eligible for the free 
childcare, daycare, and preschool. That 
is an assault on the choice that fami-
lies make. 
Then the requirement in this bill 
would be that daycare workers and pre-
school workers would have to have a 
college education, and that is an as-
sault on those home-based daycare and 
preschool facilities because this admin-
istration and their allies in academia 
are determined to get control of our 
children now from age 2 or 3 in pre-
school and beyond at your provided 
taxpayer expense. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for allowing me to be with him. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend from Virginia more 
than he can ever know, and I am glad 
he is here. 
But along the lines of rights that we 
have had, and that the Constitution 
has assured, we are finding civil lib-
erties still are being trampled. 
I have an article here by Glenn 
Greenwald, and it is just an excellent 
summary on what the title tells us: 
‘‘Civil Liberties Are Being Trampled 
By Exploiting ‘Insurrection’ Fears.’’ 
We have people in this body who are 
constantly referring to the insurrec-
tion on January 6. We have heard the 
President and others say that it was 
the worst attack on democracy ever. 
Even a person whom I don’t often agree 
with, FBI Director Christopher Wray, 
even he pointed out that, gee, it is kind 
of tough for those of us who recall 9/11 
to say January 6 was a worse attack on 
democracy. 
If you were just judging by time, I 
heard from Attorney General Garland 
and spinning the news, many, I think 2 
to 300, were charged with obstructing 
an official session of Congress for 4 to 
6 hours. But, Mr. Speaker, if you go 
back to June 22 of 2016, we had 26 hours 
of obstruction of an official session of 
Congress. Congress twice tried to go 
back into session and was prevented 
each time. It was about 26 hours before 
the efforts of so many to obstruct Con-
gress finally were withdrawn so we 
could have Congress again. 
I didn’t realize back then that this 
offense was out there. I knew there 
were many violations of House rules 
that went on, but then, Mr. Speaker, 
when you see, oh, my gosh, just ob-
structing Congress carries up to 20 
years in prison. I would be interested 
to know if any of those people who 
were obstructing an official session of 
Congress realized that they were com-
mitting a Federal felony carrying up to 
20 years in prison and up to a $250,000 
fine. 
But fortunately for them, Paul Ryan 
was Speaker and chose not to really do 
anything. Those are the kind of things 
that when the American public sees 
that people are doing things wrong who 
are supposed to be making the laws and 
following the laws and yet they are the 
worst violators, it is not helpful nor 
healthy for the country. 
I know one of my constituents—and I 
am not defending any crimes that have 
been committed—but he is a guy, he 
was on Ellen after rescuing dogs in a 
hurricane; he was arrested for his role 
in the Capitol. What I have learned 
from him and his family, gee, these 
people are being so mistreated. We 
have heard from other people. But we 
had a Federal judge here who said: 
Enough is enough. 
He finally held the warden in con-
tempt. As I understand, the warden has 
lost the job of being warden. 
There is an article from Sarah Lynch 
saying that the jail violated the civil 
rights of a U.S. Capitol riot defendant, 
but these folks not being allowed to— 
at least some of them—not to shave, 
not to get a haircut, and I thought we 
were decades past those days, because I 
know all the county jails with which I 
am familiar, they would make sure 
people were dressed out, had a haircut 
and shaved, if they wanted to, before 
they came to court, that they were not 
going to have them forced into an ap-
pearance like the Unabomber looking 
like some wild, crazy person making it 
easier for a jury to convict them be-
cause they looked like a Neanderthal. 
Yet, that is exactly what the D.C. Jail 
has been doing. 
It was reported that after the judge 
held the warden in contempt, that 
there was a late-night effort by the 
people at the D.C. Jail that, as I under-
stand it, is partially under the control 
of the Bureau of Prisons, but they sent 
people to start scrubbing the black 
mold that was causing problems for 
some of the prisoners, painted areas 
that were disgusting and that they let 
some of these folks who were arrested 
because of the January 6 events, let 
them know that we hold you account-
able and you are going to pay for it. 
Then some noted the terrible smell of 
cleaning fluid on their food that they 
couldn’t eat. Many are tired of eating 
bologna sandwiches for months and 
months in a row. 
I do know this: the reports we have 
been getting indicate that the folks 
here who are being held in pretrial con-
finement and are being punished—al-
though that is unconstitutional to pun-
ish somebody while they are awaiting 
trial and not having been convicted— 
that they are not treated nearly as 
well as bloodthirsty murderers who are 
being held in Guantanamo. 
I have been down there more than 
once. I have seen how things go there, 
and it is rather tragic that American 
citizens are being treated so much 
worse than individuals who want to de-
stroy America and who have killed and 
participated in the killing of thousands 
of Americans. 
Here is one from Gateway Pundit: 
‘‘Newly Released Video Shows January 
6 Political Prisoner Jeremy Brown 
Saving a Female Trump Supporter Who 
Was Trampled By Capitol Police.’’ 
That is from October 20. 
Here is an article that was this sum-
mer titled, ‘‘Six Months Since the Jan-
uary 6th Attack on the Capitol.’’ It 
points out that it works out to be an 
average of three defendants arrested 
every single day, including weekends, 
since January 6. Nearly 235 defendants 
have been charged with corruptly ob-
structing, influencing, or impeding an 
official proceeding, or attempting to do 
so. 
And this article from Sarah Lynch, 
October 13, ‘‘Jail Violated Civil Rights 
of Capitol Riot Defendant, U.S. Judge 
Says,’’ and a copy of that order. 
But AG Garland tried to blame D.C. 
for conditions at the jail and treatment 
at the jail when actually he is in 
charge of what happens to pretrial pris-
oners that the Department of Justice is 
going after. 
So nice try, but we need people here 
facing up to their responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just conclude 
with a comment that I never ever 
thought I would hear myself say, but 
after seeing the partisanship, the use of 
official position to help a daughter’s 
and son-in-law’s finances, thank God 
MITCH MCCONNELL didn’t bring him to 
be confirmed as a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
SCHNEIDER). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities 
toward the President.

GLOBALISM OR AMERICA FIRST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, this July 4 
we celebrated our 245th anniversary as 
a nation, and we, indeed, have a lot to 
celebrate. 
Margaret Thatcher once observed 
that while Europe was created by his-
tory, America was created by philos-
ophy. To Thatcher’s point, the United 
States is unique in history in that we 
are founded on the principle that we 
are all created equal and that our in-
alienable rights are not a grant from 
government, but they are endowed to 
us by God; and that a just form of gov-
ernment derives its power from the 
consent of the governed. 
These founding principles have made 
us a city on a hill and an example of 
freedom and liberty to the world. We 
truly hold a special place in history. 
Like every nation in history, we have 
had our challenges and we have made 
our mistakes. But we have introduced 
into humanity the model of a nation 
not defined by our government but by 
‘‘We the People.’’ 
With each generation we have per-
fected our understanding of what it 
means to realize that truth that all of 
us are created equal and that we are al-
ways working toward that more perfect 
union.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5830 
October 22, 2021 
A young nation in the scope of his-
tory, we stepped onto the world stage 
with unmatched confidence. Knowing 
that our cause was just, we pushed 
back against the designs of those in-
tent on world domination, Marxism 
and its authoritarian expression of 
communism and socialism, emerging 
victorious after World War II. 
When most nations throughout his-
tory would have required tribute, we 
instead offered the world the oppor-
tunity for partnership and peace, a 
world where trade among nations, even 
those nations that would oppose us, 
would be protected by U.S. strength. 
b 1400 
In this conflict and others since, we 
have sought friendship, not lordship 
with former foes, working often at our 
expense to build other nations. 
Free of political shackles, our sci-
entists have brought the world innova-
tion that has improved people’s lives. 
From the availability of electricity 
and energy, automobiles and airplanes, 
our advancements in medicine have 
saved lives the world over and im-
proved the quality of life for millions. 
We have reached for the stars, shar-
ing our newfound mysteries of our uni-
verse with our planet’s co-inhabitants, 
and with America’s rise, humanity has 
benefited. Here, for example, we see the 
life expectancy during what we have 
come to know as the American cen-
tury, has almost doubled, actually over 
doubled. 
While there is still work to be done, 
we can see that global abject poverty 
has declined dramatically during this 
time. And while there is legitimate de-
bate about our involvement in global 
conflicts, in the broader scope of his-
tory and humanity, we have overseen a 
period of relative peace. 
As you can see, our growth in mili-
tary strength has corresponded with 
historic lows in conflict fatalities dur-
ing what historians have called the Pax 
Americana. 
Indeed, for so many of us who are the 
recipients of these blessings, it could 
seem like these hard-earned, relative 
peace, and prosperity we enjoy as 
Americans and have shared with the 
world are guaranteed to us and that 
they will automatically endure for gen-
erations to come. To assume this would 
be a grave, arrogant, and costly mis-
calculation. 
Ronald Reagan once said that: 
‘‘Freedom is never more than one 
generation away from extinction. We 
didn’t pass it to our children in the 
bloodstream. It must be fought for, 
protected, and handed on for them to 
do the same, or one day we will spend 
our sunset years telling our children 
and our children’s children what it was 
once like in the United States where 
men were free.’’ 
We would be wise to reflect on his-
tory and take stock of this moment 
and see if there is, indeed, anything we 
can learn from history. It is notable 
that the average lifespan of super-
powers 
throughout 
history 
is 
just 
around 240 to 250 years, and as I men-
tioned at the outset, this July Fourth 
the United States celebrated our 245th 
anniversary. 
History would also tell us that there 
are fundamental reasons for the rise 
and fall of great nations. Historian and 
philosopher Will Durant wrote in his 
11-volume work titled, ‘‘The Story of 
Civilization’’ that, ‘‘A great civiliza-
tion is not conquered from without 
until it has destroyed itself from with-
in.’’ 
According to British historian and 
international relations scholar Paul 
Kennedy: 
Former great powers typically exhibit the 
same factors. . . . an overextension of the 
military and foreign liabilities, economic de-
cline of important manufacturing and agri-
cultural sectors, and fiscal irresponsibility. 
Does this sound familiar to us in this 
Chamber? But history also reveals to 
us that is there a cycle to the rise and 
fall of a great nation, a pattern, if you 
will, that typically the global power 
structure goes from a multipolar to a 
bipolar to a unipolar nation. 
Most recently we saw this coming 
out of World War II. Going into World 
War II, the world consisted of multiple 
great powers, Britain, Germany, Japan, 
and Russia struggling for preeminence. 
After the war, we moved to a bipolar 
world with the United States and the 
Soviet 
Union 
being 
the 
dominant 
forces. 
Then in 1991, the Soviet Union dis-
solved, resulting in the United States 
as the unipolar power fully ushering in 
what we now know as Pax Americana. 
Now, a multipolar world is not a 
great 
place 
to 
be. 
Historically, 
multipolar worlds have been much less 
stable. Commerce, freedom, travel, and 
navigation for people are hampered. 
Human flourishing is stifled as re-
sources are devoted to global struggles 
instead of innovations and improve-
ments in the quality of life like hos-
pitals, schools, and research. 
In spite of this, it should not surprise 
us that there are powers across our 
globe that take issue with America’s 
strong influence; that there are nations 
that would like to restructure the bal-
ance of power to diminish American in-
fluence and push us into a multipolar 
world. Indeed, this has been something 
that Iran has talked about for decades, 
and they have been vocal in their de-
sires and efforts to diminish U.S. influ-
ence and usher in a multipolar world. 
In Moscow on April 23, 1997, China 
and Russia signed the ‘‘Joint Declara-
tion on a Multipolar World and the Es-
tablishment of a New International 
Order’’ which states that: ‘‘The parties 
shall strive to promote the multi-
polarization of the world and the estab-
lishment of a new international order.’’ 
These nations have something in 
common. They have sought to consoli-
date and maintain their power, not 
through the guaranteeing of freedom 
for their people, but, rather, through 
authoritarian rule over them. 
As Americans, and certainly as pol-
icymakers, we would be gravely mis-
taken to recognize as morally equiva-
lent governing systems that seek to 
promote, protect, and preserve human 
liberty with these authoritarian sys-
tems that survived through the con-
traction of these human liberties. 
And while I may not agree with an-
other nation’s efforts to move us to-
ward a multipolar world, I certainly 
can understand them. I can understand 
their 
aspirations 
to 
diminish 
the 
United States’ influence and supplant 
it with their own. I can understand 
that they would strive to take the 
United States’ wealth and power for 
themselves. But what would be shock-
ing to most Americans, though, is to 
find that in addition to adversarial na-
tions, there are sources within our gov-
ernment that have been advocating for 
and working toward this multipolar ob-
jective for decades. 
They work to distort the American 
system, to gather wealth and power 
from the sweat, blood, and tears of 
hardworking, 
taxpaying 
Americans. 
Generations of freedom-loving Ameri-
cans, both in and out of uniform, have 
given their best under the assumption 
that this government had their best in-
terests in mind. 
In 2008, the United States National 
Intelligence Council released this re-
port: ‘‘Global Trends 2025: A Trans-
formed World.’’ 
In this report, the United States Na-
tional Intelligence Council declares: 
‘‘The unprecedented shift in relative 
wealth and economic power roughly 
from West to East now under way will 
continue. 
‘‘The 
United 
States’ 
relative 
strength—even in the military realm— 
will decline and U.S. leverage will be-
come more constrained.’’ 
They went on to explain the major 
causes for this. They said: 
‘‘In terms of size, speed, and direc-
tional flow, the transfer of global 
wealth and economic power now under 
way—roughly from West to East—is 
without precedent in modern history. 
This shift derives from two sources. 
First, increases in oil and commodity 
prices have generated windfall profits 
for the Gulf states and Russia. Second, 
lower costs combined with government 
policies have shifted the locus of manu-
facturing and some service industries 
to Asia.’’ 
So they said there are two major 
trends causing this massive shift in 
wealth from the American people to 
authoritarian 
regimes 
overseas; 
to 
summarize: ceding our oil and gas in-
dustry overseas and shifting domestic 
manufacturing overseas. 
Now, if the report were simply an 
honest look at trends—perhaps even a 
warning to us—I could appreciate that 
evaluation. But instead of making the 
necessary adjustments to counter this 
trend, our bureaucrats in D.C. em-
braced it and sought to help, aid in this 
fleecing of American wealth and tran-
sition toward a multipolar world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5831 
October 22, 2021 
As a matter of fact, the report called 
this transition ‘‘one of the world’s rel-
ative certainties.’’ The report, how-
ever, based these conclusions on as-
sumptions that we now know are false 
or, at best, incomplete. 
As a matter of fact, the Trump ad-
ministration showed us just how quick-
ly these assumptions could be upended 
as: The United States in a matter of 
months went from an energy dependent 
to an energy dominant Nation; and pol-
icy changes were put in place that 
began to encourage rather than dis-
courage companies to return to the 
U.S. soil, including manufacturing. 
Yet, those in entrenched places of 
power in our government continue to 
endorse this transition as inevitable 
and look down on those who don’t em-
brace this worldview of the sunset of 
America’s greatness as being inevi-
table. 
As a matter of fact, on July 22, 2009, 
in a speech given in the Ukraine then 
Vice President Joe Biden said of the 
Obama-Biden administration, ‘‘We are 
trying to build a multipolar world. 
. . .’’ 
We are trying to build a multipolar 
world. The Biden administration con-
tinues that effort in earnest today and 
they are doing it in a couple of dif-
ferent ways. They are earnestly at 
work to both prop up competing powers 
and also working to diminish American 
strength. 
Suddenly, as we consider more recent 
history, what has seemed like a series 
of policy missteps and blunders begins 
to make sense. We can now understand 
the stifling of energy production here 
at home while encouraging that same 
energy production overseas with far 
less environmental standards abroad; 
the tax and economic policies that 
drive American businesses and jobs 
overseas; the sending of billions of dol-
lars in foreign aid to prop up corrupt 
powers overseas. 
We can think about Afghanistan, and 
the withdrawal debacle, and the leav-
ing of billions of dollars of our best 
technology overseas, and the policies 
that discourage the American worker 
and stifle economic growth seem less 
like a tragic miscalculation and more 
like a plan. 
All of these factors contribute to this 
march toward multipolarism, that un-
precedented 
transfer 
of 
economic 
power, wealth, and influence from the 
American people to competing adver-
sarial regimes. Shall we call that a 
fleecing of the American people? 
In this time of turmoil in our Nation, 
the lurching from crisis to crisis, the 
American people have become disillu-
sioned with ‘‘leadership’’ from Wash-
ington, D.C. They have watched the 
fruit of their best efforts squandered 
away. They have watched their sons 
and daughters sent to fight endless 
wars with obscure objectives. Trillions 
have been spent by politicians with 
very few actual problems solved. 
The globalists in our government 
have been selling away our Nation’s 
treasure, the treasure that our parents, 
our grandparents, and their grand-
parents worked hard and fought for. 
This has become the real divide in 
our Federal Government. The contrast 
between 
a 
multipolar, 
globalist 
worldview that wishes to shame us out 
of our Nation’s strength and send 
America into her sunset years, or a 
world that believes that what is pre-
cious and right in America is worth 
preserving, and that we should aspire 
to be that moral beacon of liberty for 
the world to see: that city on a hill. 
Here is the good news. Never has a 
nation been so blessed with abundant 
natural resources, access to the Earth’s 
great oceans, a river system that 
waters our fertile grounds and facili-
tates commerce both in our Nation and 
to the world. 
We have a people who, unshackled by 
the burden of an overreaching govern-
ment, stand ready to do their best 
work; to apply themselves to the next 
generation of innovation and inven-
tion, of scholarship and learning; ready 
to develop the next generation of cures; 
to provide affordable food and fuel for 
our neighbors here at home and abroad; 
and, yes, also to stand ready to respond 
when those intent on tyranny, destruc-
tion, and world domination rear their 
ugly heads. 
The answer for our Nation and, in-
deed, for the world, is not the disman-
tling of the American system. It is not 
the embrace of socialist, progressive 
policies that have failed time and time 
again, leaving in its wake the shat-
tered dreams and lives of millions. 
It is not an America ducking its head 
in shame and retreating from its place 
of leadership. Rather, it is to embrace 
what has made America great in the 
first place. It is in a renewal of the 
American promise. It is in a return to 
our shared foundational values, albeit 
practiced more perfectly. 
It is in an embrace in our hearts and 
minds as Americans that we the people 
are what defines us as a nation; that we 
are one Nation under God with liberty 
and justice for all. 
This is the great work that lies be-
fore us as Americans, for those of us 
who serve in this Chamber, and to 
those for whom we represent. May our 
efforts be noble and just, and may God 
shed His grace on us. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF COL-
LEEN K. PHILLIPS UPON HER 
ELECTION 
AS 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
OHIO 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
AUXILIARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Colleen K. Phillips of Hamler, Ohio, 
upon her election as President of the Ohio 
American Legion Auxiliary. Colleen Phillips’s 
work has had a lasting influence on the Amer-
ican Legion Auxiliary and her community. She 
has proven herself as a leader and an advo-
cate for countless veterans and their families 
across the state of Ohio. 
Colleen has been a member of the Warren 
L. McIntire, Hamler American Legion Post 262 
for forty-three years. Her hard work and dedi-
cation helped establish the junior auxiliary at 
Hamler. Over the course of her career, she 
has held almost every office for the Auxiliary 
at the local, county, district, and state levels. 
Prior to this position, Colleen served as the 
Auxiliary’s First Vice President for the past two 
years. 
The mission of the American Legion Auxil-
iary of Ohio is to ‘‘honor the sacrifice of those 
who serve by enhancing the lives of our vet-
erans, military, and their families’’. Members of 
the Auxiliary strive to advocate for veterans, 
educate citizens, mentor youth, and promote 
patriotism and peace. As President, Colleen 
will engage in monthly meetings, prepare 
newsletters, perform outreach for the commu-
nity, and support the annual Buckeye Girls 
State program. Colleen has established chal-
lenging goals for the organization she plans to 
work towards during her year-long presidency. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Colleen Phillips on her 
assumption of duties as President of the Ohio 
American Legion Auxiliary and thanking her 
for service to our state. On behalf of the peo-
ple of the Fifth District of Ohio, I wish Colleen 
all the best as president and in her future en-
deavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. THEODORE ROOSEVELT 
LILLY, JR. 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Theodore 
‘‘Ted’’ Roosevelt Lilly, Jr. A beloved member 
of our community, Mr. Lilly’s life was marked 
by an unwavering commitment to spreading 
kindness and goodwill in the town of Oakboro, 
North Carolina. 
A lifelong resident of Oakboro, Mr. Lilly took 
a unique and selfless approach to serving his 
community. Aside from his brief work with 
Stanly Knitting Mills, Mr. Lilly never maintained 
formal or paid employment. Instead, he chose 
to serve the members of his community by 
spreading joy and benevolence. Every day for 
at least the last 30 years, Mr. Lilly walked 
through town to visit every business and talk 
with customers and employees. If he hap-
pened to miss an employee, he would return 
to the same business later that day to speak 
with the individual. While walking, he made it 
a goal to extend a friendly welcome to any 
passersby he encountered. Such dedication 
earned Mr. Lilly the title ‘‘Ambassador of 
Oakboro’’ and made him a household name 
among residents. 
Mr. Lilly’s steadfast commitment to building 
relationships with those in his community was 
undeterred. He extended great personal sac-
rifice by risking his own health and safety to 
complete his daily rounds. His family members 
often had to prevent him from walking in in-
clement weather, and he consistently ignored 
any pain associated with his kidney failure or 
diabetes in the process of completing his 
walks. 
Mr. Lilly passed away on October 19, 2021, 
and my thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily and all who knew and loved him. I join our 
entire community in gratitude as we honor his 
extraordinary life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Ted Lilly.

IN RECOGNITION OF TINA 
BALLARD 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Ms. Tina Ballard on her retire-
ment and thank her for 30 years of dedicated 
federal service. Most recently, she served as 
the Executive Director of the Commission, an 
independent federal agency responsible for di-
recting and managing the AbilityOne ® Pro-
gram through which federal activities purchase 
products and services from nonprofit agencies

Army Contracting and Acquisition Career Pro-
gram, Ms. Ballard was responsible for the re-
cruitment, training, education, and professional 
development of the contracting professionals 
who are part of the Army’s acquisition work-
force and industrial base policy. 
As Director of Combat Support Operations 
and the Deputy Executive Director of Contract 
Management Operations in the Defense Con-
tract Management Agency, she managed 
agency policy in multiple theatres of military 
operations. 
Ballard joined the Federal service as a Stay- 
in-School and continued her service as a col-
lege Cooperative (Co-op) Education student. 
Upon graduation, she began as Contract Spe-

the Aeronautical Systems Division, Wright-Pat-
terson Air Force Base She later transferred to 
Air Force Plant Representative Office, Boeing

four years with responsibility for more than 
200 personnel located in six countries. In Jan-
uary 1999, she accepted an assignment in the

of Defense. 
Ballard received her B.A. in English (1980),

the course of her career to the military, the 
commonwealth, and the country. On behalf of 
a grateful Nation, we wish her continued suc-
cess in her future endeavors.

STOP THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE 
MUSSELS ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA

Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I

measures to prevent the proliferation of 
invasive species in our nation’s waterways 
and surface water infrastructure like res-
ervoirs. 
Specifically, our bipartisan bill targets the in-
advertent introduction by recreational boating 
of invasive species from one federal reservoir 
to another. I thank former Congressman Ben 
McAdams (D–UT) for sponsoring this bill last 
Congress, which I have now taken over and 
improved. I also want to thank the following 
organizations for endorsing our bill: Western 
Governors’ Association, National Wildlife Fed-
eration, National Marine Manufacturers Asso-
ciation, American Sportfishing Association, 
Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Tahoe Re-
gional Planning Agency, and Association of 
Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 
Invasive species not only crowd out native 
wildlife but also cause billions of dollars in 
avoidable damage to our nation’s critical water 
infrastructure, particularly in western states 
like California. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
River Delta, I have seen the damage caused 
by invasive water hyacinth so dense you can 
literally walk on water. Proliferate quagga and 
zebra mussels clog water pipelines, reduce 
the capacity of canals, and damage dam oper-
ations for hydropower, water storage, and 
flood control. In 2007, California’s Department 
of Water Resources detected invasive quagga 
mussels in the State Water Project and the 
Colorado River Aqueduct, which supply water 
for communities in southern California. All it 
takes for these mussels to invade a new lake 
or waterway is a cup of contaminated water 
containing their microscopic larvae carried in-
advertently by a motorboat or recreational 
watercraft that has not been decontaminated 
properly. 
The 
best 
defense 
against 
spreading 
invasive aquatic species is simple: inspection 
and dry-docking or similarly effective treatment 
of contaminated watercraft for a few days until 
they are no longer a threat. Mandatory inspec-
tions by state wildlife agencies have proven 
effective at keeping these invasive mussels 
out of Lake Tahoe, one of the most popular 
recreational areas in the American West. 
Under current law, federal agencies lack a 
similar inspection authority to state wildlife 
agencies, which cannot conduct inspections 
on federal land such as National Parks and 
National Forests. 
Our bipartisan ‘‘Stop the Spread of Invasive 
Mussels Act’’ would ensure that federal land 
management agencies like the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, 
National Park Service, and U.S. Forest Serv-
ice have the authority to conduct these inspec-
tions. In addition, our bill would establish a 
new U.S. Bureau of Reclamation grant pro-
gram for inspection stations at federally man-
aged reservoirs. 
Madam Speaker, Congress can help to limit 
the spread of aquatic invasive species, protect 
our native wildlife, and reduce the need for 
more expensive remediation efforts. I urge all 
Members of the House to join us in cospon-
soring the ‘‘Stop the Spread of Invasive Mus-
sels Act.’’ 
CELEBRATING TEXAS SOUTHMOST 
COLLEGE’S 95TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Texas Southmost College (TSC) as 
they celebrate their 95th anniversary, making 
it the oldest institution of higher learning in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
Texas Southmost College is the first accred-
ited community college in the State of Texas. 
Originally named The Junior College of the 
Rio Grande Valley, TSC was established on 
August 9, 1926, with 84 students attending 
classes. In 1931 it was renamed the Browns-
ville Junior College, before its final renaming 
to Texas Southmost College in 1949. After a 
20-year partnership with University of Texas at 
Brownsville, TSC’s Board of Trustees voted to 
reestablish the college as an independent in-
stitution in 2011 and it was operating inde-
pendently by 2013. The campus, spanning 
over 48 acres, is located in Brownsville, Texas 
on the historic site of Fort Brown, the first 
United States military post in Texas. 
TSC was selected as a ‘‘Bright Spot’’ by the 
White House Initiative on Educational Excel-
lence for Hispanics in 2015 for its efforts to 
bridge the achievement gap and expand ac-
cess to quality higher education. In addition to 
offering high-quality programs that lead to ca-
reers that are in demand, TSC is the most af-
fordable institution of higher learning in the Rio 
Grande Valley, thanks to TSC’s Board of 
Trustees decision in 2013 to reduce tuition by 
40 percent. TSC currently offers two-year aca-
demic credential progression in over 50 pro-
grams of study for students pursuing bach-
elor’s degrees, and career and technical edu-
cation leading to industry certifications and as-
sociate degrees. They also offer dual-credit 
academic, career, and technical courses at no 
cost to students, saving families in the Lower 
Grande Valley $28 million in tuition and re-
lated fees since 2017. 
With a growth rate of 72 percent in the past 
four years, TSC is the fastest-growing commu-
nity college in the state of Texas, and their 
graduation rate outpaces the Texas state av-
erage by more than three percent. The Board 
of Trustees, along with TSC President Jesus 
Roberto Rodriguez, Ph.D., continue to set 
goals to ensure the long-term viability of the 
institution with a focus on fostering student 
success, leading regional workforce develop-
ment, enriching student experiences, enhanc-
ing community connections, and investing in 
each other. 
Texas Southmost College prides itself on 
fostering a welcoming environment and a 
sense of belonging for all. Madam Speaker, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
TSC on 95 years of invaluable service to the 
Lower Rio Grande Valley. Through education, 
community outreach and the promotion of indi-
vidual success, Texas Southmost College con-
tinues to strengthen the state of Texas’ pros-
perity and talent. 
HONORING STEVE KLINSKY’S 
LEADERSHIP 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Steve Klinsky for his commitment to 
our Nation’s prosperity and the education of 
our youth. Steve has served as Chairman of 
the Board of the American Investment Council 
for four years. Upon the conclusion of his term 
of leadership of the Council, we recognize 
Steve for his service, his philanthropy to his 
community, and his tremendous commitment 
to education reform. 
Steve founded New Mountain Capital in 
1999 and continues to lead the organization to 
help build better businesses, create jobs, and 
strengthen pensions. In fact, New Mountain’s 
responsible management strategy has led to 
the creation of over 49,500 jobs 
Additionally, for nearly 30 years, Mr Klinsky 
has served children in New York City and be-
yond by supporting afterschool programs and 
advocating for charter schools. Most notably, 
he founded the ‘‘Modern States’’ program 
which makes college educations accessible 
and free. Mr. Klinsky’s understanding of the 
importance of education to achieve the Amer-
ican Dream fuels his commitment to ensuring 
enrollment in Modern States’ courses are 
open to all people without regard to age, loca-
tion, family income, nationality, prior education 
or other barriers. Thanks to Mr. Klinsky’s pas-
sion for access to a college education, Modern 
States has helped more than 280,000 stu-
dents take free courses and work toward col-
lege degrees. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Steve Klinsky for his leadership.

RECOGNIZING MRS. CAROL 
CHANDLER 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mrs. Carol Chandler for her 
contributions to the agricultural community. 
Carol Chandler was called to give back to 
her community from an early age. After receiv-
ing degrees from the University of California at 
Davis and California State University at Fres-

RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSE 
FIND STEPHEN K. BANNON IN 
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in support of the rule governing 
debate for H. Res. 730, ‘‘Resolution Recom-
mending that the House of Representatives 
Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of Con-
gress for Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena 
Duly Issued by the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol.’’ 
On January 6th the domestic terrorists who 
beat law enforcement officers and breached 
the Citadel of democracy of the United States 
wore insignias of White supremacist groups, 
waved Confederate flags, hung a noose on 
the lawn, and they were shouting racial epi-
thets. 
According to published reports and his own 
public statements, Mr. Bannon had specific 
knowledge about the events planned for Janu-
ary 6th before they occurred: just before the 
day of the attack, Mr. Bannon told his lis-
teners: 
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. 
. . . It’s not going to happen like you think 
it’s going to happen. OK, it’s going to be 
quite extraordinarily different. All I can say 
is, strap in . . . You made this happen and 
tomorrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s 
get ready. So many people said, ‘Man, if I 
was in a revolution, I would be in Wash-
ington.’ Well this is your time in history. 
At 12:15 p.m. on January 6th he said to the 
assembled multitude on the Ellipse: ‘‘You will 
never take back our country with weakness.’’ 
Less than an hour later, at 1:10 p.m., he ad-
monished the crowd: ‘‘We fight like hell, and if 
you don’t fight like hell you will not have a 
country anymore.’’ 
At 
2:11 
p.m. 
the 
Trump-incited 
mob 
breached police lines on the west side of the 
Capitol. 
Madam Speaker, the assault on the U.S. 
Capitol by domestic terrorists and insurrection-
ists rightly takes its place as one of the dark-
est moments in our Nation’s history since the 
Civil War. 
Madam Speaker, the January 6th insurrec-
tion caused tragic loss of life and many inju-
ries, while leaving behind widespread physical 
damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional 
trauma for Members, Congressional employ-
ees, and the Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the Nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their 
ardent defenders and apologists across the 
aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Madam Speaker, we owe it not just to those 
who lost their lives during that day, but to all 
Americans to figure out exactly what hap-
pened and how that day came to be. 
We must understand that day in order to 
prevent the intended purpose of the January 
6th insurrection—to disrupt the Joint Meeting 
of Congress to tally the votes of presidential 
electors and announce the results to the Na-
tion and the world—from ever occurring again, 
because it was the greatest threat to the 
American Experiment since the Civil War 
when the pro-slavery forces decided to make 
war rather than let the Nation survive and the 
pro-freedom forces would accept war rather 
than let the Nation perish. 
The Select Committee has diligently contin-
ued in their duty to determine the causes and 
events that transpired during the insurrec-
tionist attack. 
Specifically, the Select Committee’s pur-
poses include: 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the Janu-
ary 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the 
United States Capitol Complex;’’ 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the inter-
ference with the peaceful transfer of power;’’ 
and 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes relating to ‘‘the influ-
encing factors that fomented such an attack 
on American representative democracy while 
engaged in a constitutional process.’’ 
In line with these purposes, the Select Com-
mittee requested information from Mr. Bannon 
central to its legislative purpose: 
On September 23, 2021, Chairman THOMP-
SON signed and transmitted a subpoena to Mr. 
Bannon, ordering the production of both docu-
ments and testimony relevant to the January 
6th attack on the Capitol. 
The subpoena required Mr. Bannon to 
produce the documents on October 7 and re-
quired his presence for deposition testimony 
on October 14. 
Mr. Bannon simply defied the subpoena— 
failing to produce the documents on October 7 
and failing to show up for the deposition on 
October 14. 
In a letter to Mr. Bannon’s counsel on Octo-
ber 15, Chairman THOMPSON noted that Mr. 
Bannon had not even attempted to provide the 
Select Committee any explanation for refusing 
to comply with the Select Committee’s de-
mand for documents and testimony on a 
range of subjects that do not involve commu-
nications with the former President. 
An individual who fails or refuses to comply 
with a House subpoena may be cited for con-
tempt of Congress, and in his October 8th let-
ter to Mr. Bannon’s counsel, Chairman THOMP-
SON warned Mr. Bannon that his continued 
non-compliance would put him in jeopardy of 
a vote to refer him to the House to consider 
a criminal contempt referral. 
Mr. Bannon’s failure to appear for deposition 
or produce responsive documents in the face 
of this clear advisement and warning by the 
Chairman constitutes willful failure to comply 
with the subpoena. 
The purpose behind seeking this information 
is because Mr. Bannon played a central role 
in organizing the January 6th attack on the 
Capitol, and understanding this role is essen-
tial to understanding the context in which the 
January 6th attack occurred. 
Mr. Bannon constructed and participated in 
the ‘‘stop the steal’’ public relations effort that 
motivated the January 6th attack. 
Mr. Bannon planned political and other ac-
tivities in advance of January 6th. 
Mr. Bannon participated in a ‘‘war room’’ of 
promoters and prominent supporters of the 
‘‘stop the steal’’ movement that met on Janu-
ary 5th. 
Mr. Bannon communicated with President 
Trump several times in advance of the Janu-
ary 6th attack, urging him to take measures to 
interfere with the count of electoral votes and 
to make January 6th a day of reckoning. 
In fact, according to published reports and 
his own public statements, Mr. Bannon had 
specific knowledge about the events planned 
for January 6th before they occurred: just be-
fore the day of the attack, Mr. Bannon urged 
his listeners: 
All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. 
. . . It’s not going to happen like you think 
it’s going to happen. OK, it’s going to be 
quite extraordinarily different. All I can say 
is, strap in . . . You made this happen and 
tomorrow it’s game day. So strap in. Let’s 
get ready. So many people said, ‘Man, if I 
was in a revolution, I would be in Wash-
ington.’ Well this is your time in history. 
In sum, Mr. Bannon appears to have played 
a multi-faceted role in the events of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and the American people are 
entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regard-
ing his actions. 
As recognized by the Supreme Court, ‘‘The 
power of the Congress to conduct investiga-
tions is inherent in the legislative process,’’ 
and that the subpoena power is a ‘‘public duty, 
which every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.’’ 
The contempt of Congress statute makes 
clear that a witness summoned before Con-
gress must appear or be ‘‘deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor’’ punishable by a fine of up to 
$100,000 and imprisonment for up to one 
year. 
Further, the Supreme Court has empha-
sized that the subpoena power is a ‘‘public 
duty, which every person within the jurisdiction 
of the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.’’ 
The Supreme Court also recently reinforced 
this clear obligation by stating that ‘‘when Con-
gress seeks information needed for intelligent 
legislative action, it unquestionably remains 
the duty of all citizens to cooperate.’’ 
Mr. Bannon has relied on no legal authority 
to support his refusal to comply in any fashion 
with the subpoena.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1134 
October 22, 2021 
Mr. Bannon’s refusal to comply with the 
subpoena is ostensibly based on his decision 
to ‘‘honor [former President Trump’s] invoca-
tion of executive privilege.’’ 
However, not only has former President 
Trump had no direct communication with the 
Select Committee, but also the Select Com-
mittee has not received any formal invocation 
of executive privilege from former President 
Trump as to Mr. Bannon. 
The Select Committee is seeking informa-
tion from Mr. Bannon on a wide range of sub-
jects that clearly cannot be covered by an as-
sertion of executive privilege. 
Mr. Bannon was a private citizen during the 
relevant period and the testimony and docu-
ments the Select Committee is demanding do 
not concern discussion of official government 
matters with the President and his immediate 
advisors. 
In sum, there is no reasonable argument 
that Mr. Bannon’s communications with the 
President regarding January 6th are the type 
of matters on which executive privilege can be 
asserted. 
Finally, there is no conceivable assertion 
that executive privilege could apply to other in-
formation sought that does not constitute com-
munications with Mr. Trump during his presi-
dency. 
Beyond 
communications 
between 
Mr. 
Bannon and Mr. Trump, the Select Committee 
seeks documents and testimony from Mr. 
Bannon regarding his own actions and inter-
actions with other private citizens relating to 
the events of January 6th. 
In light of this, rather than comply with Con-
gress’ inherent powers, and help heal the trau-
ma this Nation witnessed on January 6th, Mr. 
Bannon has simply refused to comply with the 
Select Committee’s subpoena. 
Madam Speaker, this should not be a par-
tisan issue; it is the very power of Congress 
to investigate matters of issue that is at stake. 
For this reason, I rise in support of the rule 
governing debate for H. Res. 730, ‘‘Resolution 
Recommending that the House of Representa-
tives Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of 
Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Sub-

colleagues to do the same.

Friday, October 22, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to congratulate the Howard University 
Medical Alumni Association (HUMAA) on its 
150th anniversary. 
Founded in 1871, HUMAA is one of the old-

first scholarship, $550. In recent years, 
HUMAA has been awarding $200,000 annu-
ally in scholarships. 
Today, HUMAA’s mission is to promote the 
mutual professional interests of the graduates 
of the Howard University College of Medicine 
(HUCM), assist in the development of HUCM’s 
programs and support the welfare of HUCM’s 
students. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
ANDREW G. URAM 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Andrew G. Uram, 
who passed away on October 3, 2021 at the 
age of 100. 
Growing up during the Great Depression, 
Andrew displayed an incredible work ethic and 
selflessness at a young age. His widowed 
mother, despite the privation of the times, in-
stilled in him the belief that it was better to 
give than to receive—a belief that would come 
to define Andrew’s life. He graduated from 
Butler High School in 1937 and went to work 
for Armco Steel, clocking in as much as pos-
sible. Following America’s entrance into World 
War II, Andrew put his career on hold and 
joined the U.S. Navy, serving as an Aviation 
Cadet. 
After returning from service in 1945, Andrew 
went to work for Metropolitan Life as an agent. 
In just a few years, he was promoted to the 
company’s field training division in New York 
City. In 1955, the company sent Andrew to 
Washington County, Pennsylvania to serve as 
a district manager in charge of 35 agents and 
10 clerks. At the time, he was the company’s 
youngest manager. In 1969, Andrew was hired 
as vice president at Mellon Bank’s Washington 
branch. At 65, he retired from banking and 
transitioned to commercial real estate. 
While he had a distinguished and successful 
professional life, Andrew would be the first to 
tell you his true passion was giving. Andrew 
became deeply involved with the Washington 
County Community Chest in 1956. By the mid- 
1960s, following their transition to the United 
Way, he was already bringing in $1 million for 
the organization. Andrew was also Chairman 
of the Catawba District of the Boy Scouts of 
America, President and Paul Harris Fellow of 
the Washington Rotary Club, Director of the 
Greater Washington Area Chamber of Com-
merce, and District Governor of Rotary, 
Andrew truly left his mark on southwestern 
Pennsylvania. He was instrumental in securing 
the donation of Heritage Reservation, where 
local Boy Scouts have camped for genera-
tions. Andrew also helped build the current 
home of the Citizen’s Library in Washington. 
The community consistently honored An-
drew for his generosity and leadership. The 
Jaycees gave him and his late wife, Julie, the 
Distinguished Service Award. The Boy Scouts 
named Andrew a Silver Beaver, their highest 
local honor. The Rotary Club of Washington 
not only gave him an international service 
award, but it also named the award in his 
honor. Notably, Andrew was named Philan-
thropist of the Year in 2016. 
Madam Speaker, Andrew Uram was an in-
credibly accomplished community leader, phi-
lanthropist, and one of the kindest people in 
Washington County. It was a privilege to have 
known him. Andrew is survived by his sons 
James, Paul, Thomas, and Matthew, as well 
as his grandchildren, Brooke and Andrew. 
Please join me and the Uram family in cele-
brating his life.

IN SUPPORT OF RULE GOVERNING 
DEBATE OF H.R. 3110, PUMP FOR 
NURSING MOTHERS ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support H.R. 3110, the ‘‘Pump for 
Nursing Mothers Act,’’ which will close an un-
intentional loophole in the 2010 Break Time 
for Nursing Mothers Act. 
The 2010 law requires employers to provide 
break time and a place for hourly wage-earn-
ing and some salaried employees to express 
breast milk at work for one year after the birth 
of the employee’s child. 
Unfortunately, this law unintentionally ex-
cluded a quarter of all working women—nearly 
nine million employees—from protection. 
H.R. 3110 closes this coverage gap by ex-
tending the law’s protections to cover salaried 
employees as well as other categories of em-
ployees currently exempted from protections, 
such as teachers, nurses, and farmworkers. 
H.R. 3110 would also provide employers 
clarity on paid and unpaid pumping time. 
The bill leaves in place existing law pro-
tecting many salaried workers from having 
their pay docked and clarifies that employers 
must pay an hourly employee for any time 
spent pumping if the employee is also work-
ing. 
Lastly, the bill would ensure that nursing 
mothers have access to remedies that are 
available for other violations of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
According to the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, women with children are 
the fastest-growing segment of the workforce, 
and balancing work and family is an important 
priority for all employees. 
More than 80 percent of new mothers in the 
United States begin breastfeeding, 1 and 6 in 
every 10 new mothers are in the workforce. 
New parents face an incredible amount of 
increased difficulties while juggling work, fam-
ily and mental and emotional tolls that are ex-
acerbated as a new parent. 
According to a study published in Reviews 
in Obstetrics and Gynecology, breastfeeding 
provides health benefits for not only infants, 
but also for mothers. 
For mothers, abstaining from breastfeeding 
has been associated with an increase in de-
veloping various types of cancers, type 2 dia-
betes, heart attacks, retained gestational

weight gain and metabolic syndrome in adult 
women. 
For infants, not being breastfed is associ-
ated with infectious illnesses such as pneu-
monia, ear infections, gastroenteritis, and can 
increase the risk of developing childhood- 
onset obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, leukemia 
and SIDS. 
This bill will ensure that mothers will no 
longer be forced to choose between their own 
health, their infant’s health, and their income. 
This includes individuals like Melissa Hodg-
kins, who has had to bring suit against her 
employer simply to provide workers with a 
clean, private place and breaks to breast 
pump at work. 
Her coworkers were often of losing their 
paychecks to ask the airline to accommodate 
them; in fact, when some of her coworkers did 
ask for breaks and a place to pump, her em-
ployer actually prohibited them from pumping 
at work, and even forced them off the job with-
out a paycheck. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will stop 
such bad actions by employers and alleviate 
the disparities that currently exist between 
breastfeeding employees and their coworkers, 
sending a clear message that the workforce 
will protect and support women who opt to 
balance a career and motherhood. 
For these reasons, I encourage all Members 
to support H.R. 3110, the ‘‘Pump for Nursing 
Mothers Act.’’

HONORING CHARLOTTE WINKKY IN 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
HER 
EIGHT-
IETH BIRTHDAY 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Charlotte Winkky in celebration of her 
eightieth birthday. 
Charlotte, daughter of Max and Gertrud 
Sommerfeld, was born on October 24, 1941 in 
Hamburg, Germany and came to the United 
States with her parents in 1949 as a ‘‘dis-
placed person’’. Charlotte’s father was a Holo-
caust survivor, and the family was given the 
opportunity to start a new life in America. 
Charlotte and her family arrived in Boston, 
Massachusetts in August of 1949 and then re-
located to Newburgh, New York. 
Charlotte graduated from Newburg Free 
Academy and received a Bachelor of Science 
Degree from New York State College at 
Cortland where she met her husband, Bill 
Winkky. Charlotte went on to earn her Master 
of Science Degree from Elmira College and 
thereafter, in 1960, Charlotte became a proud 
Naturalized Citizen. 
On June 23, 1963, Charlotte and Bill were 
married in New Windsor, New York and have 
spent fifty-eight joyful years together. Bill and 
Charlotte have a son and daughter who have 
gifted them with six wonderful grandchildren. 
Charlotte taught school for thirty-two years 
in Horseheads, New York and is active in nu-
merous organizations including as a charter 
and sustaining member of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum. She was a 
Chemung County Election Inspector for four-
teen years and volunteers for the Cancer So-
ciety and local nature center. She is also a 
member of B’nai B’rith International and 
League of Women Voters. 
In her eighty years of life, Charlotte has 
been a teacher, a friend, a volunteer, a loving 
and dedicated wife, mother, and grandmother 
who is deserving of recognition. 
It has been my utmost pleasure to person-
ally know Charlotte for decades and to see 
her dedication to her community, but even 
more importantly, the love and dedication she 
has for her family and friends. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor Charlotte Winkky on her eightieth birth-
day.

HONORING THE JEWISH WAR VET-
ERANS (JWV) DEPARTMENT OF 
MINNESOTA 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Jewish War Veterans 
(JWV) Department of Minnesota as members 
celebrate their 75th anniversary year. For 
three quarters of a century, the Minnesota 
JWV has been the premier voice for Jewish 
uniformed service members and veterans in 
Minnesota, upholding the national organiza-
tion’s mission to affirm the heroic and honor-
able service of Jewish veterans and fight 
against anti-Semitism. 
The national organization, Jewish War Vet-
erans of the United States of America, was 
founded by a group of 63 Jewish veterans of 
the Civil War in 1896 in response to a series 
of anti-Semitic comments made about Jewish 
service in the war. JWV is the oldest congres-
sionally chartered veterans’ organization and 
has grown to include over 15,000 members 
across the country. Saint Paul Post 162 is led 
by Commander Jim Hassing and was founded 
in 1938 by World War I veterans as the first 
Jewish War Veteran Post in Minnesota. In the 
following years, the official Jewish War Vet-
erans Department of Minnesota was created 
and today is home to two other posts; the 
Nilva-Dansky-Neff Post 331, led by Com-
mander Ben Weisbuch, and the Abrahamson- 
Biglow-Spector Post 354, led by Commander 
Stewart Mednick. 
Throughout its history, the JWV has gone 
above and beyond fighting anti-Semitism 
through their many avenues of service to vet-
erans and their families. They helped to estab-
lish the Jewish chaplaincy within the military 
and fought for the inclusion of grave markers, 
including the Star of David, in veteran’s ceme-
teries. They have stood up against the rise of 
Nazi Germany, campaigned for religious and 
racial protections in the 1944 GI Bill, and 
helped pass multiple bills that awarded Medals 
of Honor to Jewish service members. The 
JWV 
has 
also 
supported 
active 
duty 
servicemembers by sending care packages to 
troops during World War II, the Vietnam War, 
and after 9/11, during the wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. They also established the National 
Museum of American Jewish Military History in 
Washington, D.C. to serve as a tribute to the 
long and proud history of Jewish American 
military service. More recently, the JWV has 
been an active supporter for the Global War 
on Terrorism Memorial Foundation which 
would honor the sacrifices made by all those 
who have served in the nation’s longest con-
flict. 
As a congressionally chartered veterans 
service organization, the Jewish War Veterans 
Department of Minnesota is one of nine orga-
nizations that make up the Minnesota Com-
manders’ Task Force, a group created in 1988 
that meets regularly to discuss issues affecting 
veterans and their families across the state. 
The Minnesota JWV provides an important 
voice to this group as they act as advisory 
board to the Minnesota Commissioner of Vet-
erans Affairs and work to develop a unified 
Minnesota Veterans Legislative Agenda and 
establish Veterans programs throughout the 
state. It has been my distinct pleasure to work 
with this great organization over the years as 
a lifetime Auxiliary member of the VFW and 
the American Legion, and as a State Rep-
resentative and now as a Member of Con-
gress. 
Led today by Commander Lou Michaels, the 
Jewish War Veterans Department of Min-
nesota continues to be a valuable advocate 
for Jewish servicemembers and their families 
in the state of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in recognizing all members of 
the Jewish War Veterans Department of Min-
nesota as they celebrate their 75th year of 
service to the community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROBERT JULIANO

OF CONNECTICUT

tionately knew as Cool Bobby J. A longtime 
labor representative and an unmatched cham-
pion of workers, Bob’s efforts in Washington, 
D.C., were guided by his work in the 1960s 
and 1970s as an elevator operator on the 
West Side of Chicago. 
Bob believed deeply in the power of biparti-
sanship to protect workers. He came to Wash-
ington to serve as a legislative representative 
for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Inter-
national Union. He served as chairman and 
vice chairman of the U.S. Government’s Trav-
el and Tourism Advisory Board in the 1980s 
and 1990s. 
A fierce advocate in the labor movement 
and a friend to all—Bob shook hands and be-
came close with some of our nation’s top lead-
ers in the fight for labor equality. He worked 
with UNITE HERE to protect the health care 
benefits of retired miners and worked on near-
ly every major piece of labor legislation over 
the last four decades. 
Bob loved telling the story of an event he 
hosted at his house—‘a pizza competition.’ I 
brought the best pizza in the country from 
New Haven, CT, and he brought a deep-dish 
pizza from Chicago. The way he tells it, deep 
dish pizza won, but everyone in attendance 
knows New Haven pizza won by a landslide. 
Our pizza preferences may have differed, but 
as children of Italian immigrants, we created 
an unwavering bond.

OPENING OF THE JOSEPH H. 
VICARI SENSORY SPACE 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
earlier this week in my district in Ocean Coun-
ty, New Jersey, family members, friends, and 
service providers for children with autism 
marked the official opening of the Joseph H. 
Vicari Sensory Space inside the Toms River 
Branch of the Ocean County Library system. 
Like so many worthwhile endeavors across 
our country, this project had been slowed—but 
not stopped—by the impact of COVID–19. 
Originally due to open earlier this year, this 
Sensory Space is now fully operational and 
providing a new hub to boost learning experi-
ences for children with autism. 
Housed within the heart of the main branch 
of the county library system, the Joseph H. 
Vicari Sensory Space has been carefully de-
signed and supplied with special learning tools 
to help develop the senses, encourage com-
munication and social interactions, relieve 
stress and anxiety, and promote calmness and 
well-being in children with autism. The Sen-
sory Space offers a comfortable place and 
sends a positive message to people with vary-
ing degrees of sensory processing abilities 
who might feel inhibited in social environ-
ments. 
Having toured the new facility this spring 
with Ocean County Commissioner Joseph 
Vicari, Ocean County Library Director Susan 
Quinn and Ocean County Library Commission 
Chair Ruthanne Scaturro and several dedi-
cated library officials, I am confident that this 
space will not only serve those who visit ex-
ceptionally well, but will also inspire and serve 
as a model of how a community can expand 
learning opportunities and accommodate chil-
dren on the autism spectrum. 
The Sensory Space includes such innova-
tive features as: 
A touching wall that uses musical sounds, 
shapes, numbers and colors for visual and au-
ditory stimulation. 
A sensory canopy of billowing, magnetic 
fabrics that create an impression of clouds 
overhead. 
LED illuminators for aid in color recognition, 
sensory stimulation and visual attention. 
An ocean wave ceiling projector, which 
combines ambient or customizable audio with 
colorful light effects to enhance relaxation. 
A bubble tube calming device that cycles 
through hundreds of different shades of color. 
An LED light table and colorful jigsaw play 
box, which illustrates the effects of colors and 
light on everyday objects and passively en-
hances creative ability. 
A fiber optic color-changing light waterfall, 
providing tactile stimulation through touch and 
manipulation, 
and 
visual 
impressions 
of 
changing, bending lights. 
A colorful mat with matching cubes to build 
color recognition, stimulate imagination, exer-
cise gross motor skills and develop spatial 
reasoning. 
In addition to County Commissioner Vicari, 
Library Director Quinn and Library Commis-
sion Chairwoman Scaturro, other key individ-
uals who must be credited in the development 
and completion of the space include: Library 
Commissioner Susan Hutler; Assistant Library 
Director Sara Siegler; Facilities Manager Joe 
Cahill; Assistant Facilities Managers Michael 
Erickson and Barry DePaul; Toms River 
Branch Chief Librarian Rachel Lavoie-Dohn; 
Jackson Branch Librarian Wendi Smolowitz, 
Chair of the Library’s Autism Resources Com-
mittee, and Administrative Clerk Kelly Nichols. 
Nearly twenty-five years ago, Ocean County 
residents, Bobbie and Billy Gallagher, parents 
with two small children with autism, reached 
out to me looking for help and underscoring 
the fact that the federal government was doing 
next to nothing in providing support for re-
search, early education intervention and treat-
ments for children with autism. Armed with 
data and their own research, the Gallaghers 
helped me win approval of landmark federal 
legislation, the ASSURE Act of 2000—to cre-
ate a comprehensive federal program to com-
bat autism. 
Since then, Congress has enacted three ad-
ditional comprehensive laws I have written to 
provide significant federal resources for re-
search, education, and early intervention for 
children with autism. My most recent law, 
known as the Autism CARES Act of 2019, au-
thorized $1.8 billion through 2024 for research 
grants, awareness programs, surveillance, 
early detection and intervention, parental sup-
port and training for health care professionals. 
And for the first time, my new law will expand 
federal support to adults with autism. 
Over the last two decades, the support sys-
tems for children and families with autism has 
grown nationwide, with many community orga-
nizations leading the way. 
I am deeply grateful for the innovative, local 
grassroots efforts here in Ocean County—es-
pecially and including the Joseph H. Vicari 
Sensory Space, with its pioneering, state-of- 
the-art facility that will attract and support indi-
viduals with autism and his or her caregivers 
for many years to come.

SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO FREE IRAN SPEECH 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to include in the RECORD the following remarks 
by Michael R. Pompeo. former Secretary of 
State of the United States. Secretary Pompeo 
addressed the ‘‘Support Free Iran, U.S. To 
Hold Ebrahim Raisi Accountable for the 1988 
Massacre’’ on Monday, September 20, 2021, 
in Washington, D.C. Below is Secretary 
Pompeo’s speech. 
‘‘Thank you all so much. That’s an amaz-
ing welcome I hope you are as happy after 
my remarks. I think you will. 
Thank you, Amir, for that kind introduc-
tion. It is such a blessing for me to be with 
you all today. It is a special gathering that 
we can all be together to talk about an enor-
mous threat to the world and to freedom lov-
ing people. It’s truly an honor. 
Since I last spoke to you Ebrahim Raisi 
was formally installed as Iran’s latest so- 
called President. You are rightly gathered at 
this conference with the theme of demanding 
that he be held accountable for what hap-
pened in 1988, the massacre of political pris-
oners inside of Iran. And I want each of you 
to know today that I join with you in your 
cause! 
I came to know Raisi when I was the CIA 
Director. He should be prosecuted; not to-
morrow; not next week; not next year. Pros-
ecute him now. 
And of course, I will talk more about this. 
But I support a free Iran! Bless you for stay-
ing in the fight. 
Make no mistake, Make no mistake. 
Ebrahim Raisi, himself is personally respon-
sible for the mass execution of thousands of 
Iranian political prisoners, names of over 
5,000 have been published. The bodies of these 
brave men and women were dumped in un-
marked graves. And Because Iran has never, 
and likely under this regime will never allow 
an investigation into these killings, we do 
not know the true number of Iranians who 
were murdered. But it is almost certainly 
more than the 5,000 list of names that we 
have. 
Your actions, our actions supporting our 
love of the Iranian people must begin by 
holding Ebrahim Raisi accountable for his 
crimes against humanity. Remember he 
wasn’t an advisor; he wasn’t a foot soldier. 
He was an executioner. 
I know there are those in the audience who 
have family that were killed in Raisi’s mas-
sacre. Too, some of you have loved one and 
friends currently imprisoned, in Evin and 
elsewhere in Iran, and some, who have had 
loved ones simply disappeared or worse. We 
will never forget any of them and will pray 
for you and each of them. 
You know this character Ebrahim Raisi is 
exactly who Khamenei wants as President— 
someone who will do his bidding. Someone 
willing to brutalize and slaughter the Ira-
nian people at his command. This is not 
moving forward. It is moving backwards. 
It is only those who are resisting, both in-
side and out, who provide the hope for Iran. 
That is why this gathering and the work you 
do today is so important. 
The contrast between a government that 
serves its people rather than subjugates 
them is incredibly stark. We can see it. That 
should be all of our inspiration for freedom 
for the Iranian people. 
It’s has been almost eight months since I 
left office as the Secretary of State. When 
we left as Secretary of State, Iran was more 
isolated and the regime as weak than ever. 
However, I must say I’ve watched the events 
of the past weeks and months and I worry 
that events in Afghanistan and the posture 
of the current administration are allowing 
the regime to get ‘‘off the mat’’ and re- 
strengthen. I know the Iranian people do not 
want that. That is why we must keep pres-
sure on our representatives to forgo renego-
tiating the nuclear deal and avoid paying 
Iran ransom to either re-enter that deal or 
because they believe it would be a show of 
‘‘good will.’’ Good will is not something a 
terrorist regime understands. We must also 
ensure that advancements in the Iranian nu-
clear program are strictly monitored, and 
action taken whether that’s by the United 
States, other western nations or by the IAEA 
to ensure that they don’t just run out the 
clock on the path not only to a nuclear 
weapon but to a full nuclear program. 
I must say, over the last year or so of the 
pandemic the Iranian regime has used the 
coronavirus to continue crackdown on its 
own citizens. Its actions are not only igno-
rant but malevolent. They have used the 
pandemic to extinguish uprisings and subdue 
the Iranian people. This is totally unaccept-
able.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1137 
October 22, 2021 
As Americans, we know supporting the 
general welfare of our citizens is the duty of 
the government, and to subjugate them is 
horrific. 
And while we know that the Iranian re-
gime does not value freedom, we should at 
least expect the United States to value that 
freedom. You have all watched these last few 
weeks. Our credibility was called into ques-
tion in our disgraceful exit from Afghanistan 
and again questioned this past week when 
our own Secretary of State took down a 
tweet of support for the people of Hong Kong 
who were asking for freedom in their strug-
gle against the Chinese Communist Party. 
These demonstrations of the absence of re-
solve and lack of support for freedom-loving 
people are the welcome by terrorists and 
those oppressing the people of Iran. 
And yet we know that the more the gov-
ernment attempts to strengthen its hold 
over the people of Iran, the weaker it will be-
come. This is certainly the case today. Pro-
tests spurred by water shortages erupted in 
over half of the country’s provinces and pro-
tests have taken place in Ahvaz, in Tabriz, in 
Tehran, and in Isfahan, and other cities all 
across Iran. These protestors, these amazing 
freedom-loving people have shown consider-
able resilience and bravery in resisting the 
regime. And I know that in the end the Ira-
nian people will have a secular, democratic, 
and nonnuclear republic. 
The actions in 1979 were of course a key 
turning point. To understand Iran and its 
rightful place in history we must unpack 
what happened in 1979. I think this is why 
Iran will never return to rule by a dictato-
rial Shah or theocratic regime. This fight is 
the real fight and it began in those frightful 
first moments of the so-called revolution in 
1979. 
The central fight is the one in the streets, 
and in the mosques and in the minds of the 
Iranian people—it is the divide between the 
people and the organized opposition seeking 
freedom and democracy on one side, and the 
entirety of the regime on the other. 
Look I have been at this, but not as long as 
some of you. But I have been in this fight on 
the right side for over a decade now, my en-
tire life of decade of public service. 
Back in 2010 I spoke with many of you. I 
spoke of the Iranian people and their his-
tory, their kindness and their respect for 
reason, knowledge and respect for human 
life. The Iranian people are tolerant people— 
They have been a homeland for Arabs and 
Jews, Christians and Muslims right on Ira-
nian soil. This is the loveliness of the Ira-
nian people. 
The Iranians want to prosper in their faith 
and protect their families—this is as true in 
Tehran as it is in any place here in the 
United States and don’t ever forget that. 
There is a new leader, there’s a new elect-
ed. I say that word cautiously. The regime 
headed by the puppet Raisi and the IRGC is 
no less radical than the one left by the pre-
vious president It continues to be revolu-
tionary in its zeal. It is brutal. It is theo-
cratic. 
It is also craven and fearful of the Iranian 
people. It’s kleptocratic. Its leaders will and 
have killed their own by the thousands and 
then choose those who committed these mas-
sive atrocities, like Raisi, to now lead their 
terror organization and their regime. Its 
leaders can shoot down a civilian airliner 
killing hundreds of civilians and think noth-
ing of denying responsibility and hiding the 
black box that would unpack the clues and 
fingerprints of the regime’s leaders who 
caused the death of civilians. The leaders in 
Iran seek not only to dominate their own 
country and their own people, hut capitals 
from Baghdad to Tehran and from Damascus 
to Beirut and to Sanaa. All for the petty de-
sire to maintain their grip on power. 
When I last spoke to you, I noted that we 
must dismiss the Western conceit. I hear it 
even in this city which we are sitting today. 
It’s this western conceit commonly accepted 
in Brussels, in Paris, in Bonn and in too 
many places here in the United States that 
there are moderates inside of the regime. I 
never met one, nor read of one. This is im-
portant. The lie, that there are moderates 
inside of this regime. There are too many 
countries that play footsie with this ter-
rorist regime. The elections of last month 
should provide evidence that this claim of 
moderation is even possible within this re-
gime. We cannot have them fool us. These 
are but tiny actors occupying roles in the 
same show of force. 
We know the characters. The Ayatollah 
plays the father, keeper of the so-called revo-
lutionary faith and is the elder statesman 
‘‘protecting the revolution’’ from every 
threat—including the threats from the hea-
then secular inside and outside of Iran. 
Soleimani played the warrior-hero-role. De-
liverer of rights against made-up grievances 
from the near abroad and afar. The newly in-
stalled Foreign Minister, Hossein Amit- 
Abdollahian, was molded by Soleimani. This 
man, despite of the fact that he is a dip-
lomat, a Foreign Minister, make no mistake 
who he is. He is a staunch supporter of the 
‘‘Axis of Resistance,’’ the array of terrorists 
that Iran supports throughout the entire 
Middle East. He is a terrorist himself who 
would kill his own people to save the regime 
just as quickly as any other of the Aya-
tollah’s henchmen Don’t let that title of dip-
lomat fool anyone. 
Ebralum Raisi, a murderer of his own peo-
ple, will now take on the role as heir appar-
ent to the faith and determined negotiator 
who concurs America by getting the im-
moral sanctions placed upon the people lift-
ed and improving life for all. This will be the 
theatre of Ebrahim Raisi. These actors—each 
of them, all of them will keep this show 
going despite the audience wanting their run 
to end and they are prepared to use every 
power, to use the IRGC, to use the Basij and 
any tool to keep their grip over the Iranian 
people. 
There is nothing new about them. They are 
just the next generation of the regime, per-
haps even more radical than their prede-
cessors. Every one of them should be held ac-
countable, all of them should be held ac-
countable, for the tens of thousands of Ira-
nians they have murdered. 
And world leaders, I hope you are listen-
ing, should band together to reject Raisi; 
each of you, each of you should reject Raisi. 
You should refuse to engage with him, to ac-
knowledge him as a democratically elected 
president by the people—since he was no 
such thing. A good place to start would be by 
this week at the United Nations General As-
sembly, not too far from where we are all sit-
ting, holding Raisi accountable for his 
crimes against the people of Iran. It’s pos-
sible to do. 
Speaking of Raisi’s actions, Kumi Naidoo, 
Secretary General of Amnesty International 
(2018–2020), said in his remarks to the Call for 
Justice: ‘‘I served as the Secretary-General 
of Amnesty International during which time 
a report was brought out on this terrible 
tragedy and the tragedy of 1988 that we saw 
took place in Iran. Let us be very clear, what 
happened in 1988 was a totally brutal mas-
sacre of political prisoners, which is a crime 
against humanity.’’ This former leader of 
Amnesty closed with this. ‘‘And if you go 
with the definition, notwithstanding the 
technicalities, it amounts to genocide.’’ We 
know a bit about this. We have to keep the 
Iranian regime in a box. 
Contrast the current administration’s pos-
ture toward the regime with the one that the 
Trump administration had. Our mission was 
really very simple. We laid down 12 very sim-
ple demands, twelve requirements that made 
clear that if the Iranian regime failed to do 
that we would apply every American power 
and indeed we would build a coalition around 
the world to deny the regime the power to 
kill its own people and to foment terror 
around region and indeed around the world. 
This seemed so straight forward to me. We 
formed alliances to achieve these ends and 
supported Israel’s efforts to enhance our 
pressure campaign as well. 
This administration is returning to the 
roots of its past, It’s the Obama Policy 2.0. 
They are seeking to walk away from the sup-
port we had provided to the Iranian people 
just as they did in 2009, when the Iranian 
people demanded freedom and the adminis-
tration walked away from them. 
But here is the good news. The resistance 
forces in Iran, these noble Iranian patriots, 
are as strong as they have ever been, and 
they provide optimism for everyone around 
them who supports them. You do that too. 
You can actually see the effects of the last 
years of our work in their recent elections. 
Every more effort had to be made. The re-
gime became more desperate, the fraud had 
to be increased and the Iranian people could 
see it as plain as day. Since 1979, every elec-
tion in Iran has served only to give an ap-
pearance of republicanism to a corrupt, bru-
tal theocracy. The 2021 presidential election, 
however, was different. It is vastly different 
from those before it, primarily because it is 
taking place when the theocratic regime is 
at its most precarious state since it took 
power in 1979, and the people of Iran know 
this. Its prospects of survival are openly 
questioned by regime insiders and challenged 
by a restive, freedom-seeking nation. In 
short, you all know the math. Very few actu-
ally voted FOR Raisi. Turnout was the low-
est since 1979 marking a total rejection of 
the regime and its candidate. 
Even the regime admitted for the first 
time in 40 years that the majority of Iranian 
people stayed away from the ballot box. It 
was, in fact, a boycott of the regime—and 
the regime leader fear and know it. 
This boycott is evidence that the Iranian 
people pin no hope on elections as a conduit 
for substantive change. 
The program that we implemented also 
served to lay bare the regime’s economic in-
competence, systemic corruption, and out-
right plunder of the country’s wealth that 
have pushed 80% of the population below the 
poverty line. They see the corrupt ruling 
theocracy as their true enemy and the first 
and foremost cause of the economic crises. 
One of the most dominant slogans in the re-
cent uprisings has been, ‘‘Our enemy is right 
here; they lie when they say it is America.’’ 
History is replete with protest movements. 
As with all protest movements, flags were 
burned, right? This is what people do, but 
now, the most common flag being burned 
was not the Israeli or the American flag, but 
the flag of this evil regime. 
So, what is ahead? So how do we all move 
forward together? What is the path that we 
move down to? 
The regime is at its weakest point in its 
now 40 plus years of existence Iranians from 
every corner of the nation are seeing with 
their own eyes, the failure of the regime to 
deliver on the very promises that it made. 
The epic incompetence in handling COVID–19 
is on-going—vaccination in Iran is at among 
the lowest rates in the entire world not be-
cause the vaccine is not available, but be-
cause the regime refuses to accept vaccines 
from those prepared to give them to them. 
Indeed, they rejected it from the Trump ad-
ministration. This epic incompetence and 
quest for nuclear power has made it pariah,

has made Iran, the regime, pariah, even to 
its fellow Muslim countries in the region. 
It’s epic incompetence in simply ruining 
the nation has resulted in has made food and 
gas and the most basic staples unaffordable 
and the nation’s ability to respond to nat-
ural disasters like floods and earthquakes 
virtually nonexistent. The Iranian people are 
wise. They can see that Iran is not working 
The people know it. 
As for President Raisi, he is the not he 
President of the people of Iran. He is the 
President for the Ayatollah. His mission is 
clear. Inflict pain Frighten, continue to loot 
and plunder. Protect the clerics and protect 
the Republican Guards. He was chosen by the 
Ayatollah now because he is only 60 years 
old and thus could lead for the next two to 
three decades. I don’t believe that’s the fate 
of the Iranian people. These years will give 
him the time he needs to get his own people 
into place and demonstrate that the Su-
preme Leader wants him to have time to pre-
pare for the next phase of the of the so-called 
revolution. He will use the IRGC and his 
Qods Force to generate conflict externally to 
deflect attention and to maintain the nar-
rative of the oppressed. 
The path forward calls This calls for a 
clear response—the United States must lead 
the world, starting today, on this occasion, 
to hold him accountable for crimes against 
humanity that he committed. Any dealings 
with Raisi, would he tantamount to dealing 
with a mass murderer. This is not only im-
moral but counterproductive. All of us 
should make this crystal clear to our allies 
in Europe and Asia as well and hold them ac-
countable if they deal with this man that 
sent thousands of his country to execution in 
1988. 
It is worth noting that the apologists for 
the regime suggest that Raisi’s election and 
the power now in the hands of ‘‘hardliners’’ 
is a result of the American pressure on the 
regime. This is nonsense. Utter nonsense. 
The latter notion that of hardliners versus 
reformers or moderates is not remotely re-
flective of the total control of the Ayatollah 
over everything that so that nothing moves 
without his blessing inside of that country. 
As for whether pressure drives Iran to con-
tinue it authoritarian ways, it is obvious 
that Iran’s leadership has been static or 
trending right for two decades. 
The world often overstates its influence on 
domestic politics. It is the people of Iran who 
have the power. The Ayatollah has been very 
intent. Raisi demonstrates that IRGC gen-
eration is replacing the Revolutionary gen-
eration. Moreover, while Raisi and others 
have criticized this nuclear deal, it touches 
none of their equities. Thus, they get to use 
the deal politically and reap the benefits 
from the resources received to protect the 
Ayatollah and his henchmen. So, he will 
complain about the deal, he will use it to 
gain more concessions from a deal-hungry 
U.S., but won’t, in the end, block it. 
I worry, too, that the situation on the Ira-
nian border with Afghanistan will only 
strengthen the Iranian regime’s hand. The 
Iranians watched as the United States pro-
jected weakness and chaos as it withdrew 
from Afghanistan. And we know that the Ira-
nians thrive on weakness. We also know that 
it always emboldens our adversaries. 
The truth is that the present administra-
tion inherited an orderly plan for a draw-
down in Afghanistan based on firm condi-
tions to keep our people safe. And the people 
of our allies who were fighting in Afghani-
stan and alongside of us as well. 
The Administration ripped up that plan 
and turned it into a chaotic rush for exit. 
And thirteen brave Americans paid with 
their lives. 
I worry that same weakness will enable a 
blood thirsty Iranian regime to be even more 
harsh on its own people who oppose the re-
gime, and the American weakness will em-
bolden the ‘‘Axis of Resistance’’ to spark in-
creased terrorism in the Middle East and, in-
deed, all around the world. 
In fact, in the wake of our Afghanistan 
withdrawal, here is what Raisi said, ‘‘Amer-
ica’s military defeat and its withdrawal 
must become an opportunity to restore life, 
security and durable peace in Afghanistan 
Iran backs efforts to restore stability in Af-
ghanistan and, as a neighboring and brother 
nation, Iran invites all groups in Afghani-
stan to reach a national agreement’’ Let me 
translate that for you. Iran welcomes Af-
ghanistan as another tool in the terrorist 
hub of the ‘‘Axis of Resistance.’’ 
They don’t want good things for the Af-
ghan people any more than they want good 
things for their own people. They want the 
very power that they have so dearly clutched 
onto for these decades at the expense of the 
Iranian people. It is worth us all remem-
bering today that this is not the first con-
nection to external terror. The Ayatollah al-
ready hosts the most senior Al Qaeda leader-
ship in his country. Let me say that again: 
Al Qaeda international, the headquarters for 
Al Qaeda’s operational leaders that builds up 
plots across the world is not in Afghanistan 
is NOT in Afghanistan, it is not in the Af-
ghan border, it is not Pakistan—we know 
they are being hosted, protected, and oper-
ating today from Iran. 
And don’t forget this. The Ayatollah did 
not truly conduct a revolution, although he 
will claim that. No, revolutions move their 
people towards modernity and reason and to 
light, this was not a revolution, but a devo-
lution of the basic standards of human rights 
that the rich of history of Iran had promoted 
for decades and decades. 
There is not far from here, think tanks and 
salons and some of the nicer parties where 
there is this idea that there is no solution if 
the regime is overthrown. The Ayatollah— 
and many will tell you that you are better 
off with the devil you know. The Iranian peo-
ple don’t believe that for a second because it 
is fundamentally untrue. There are many 
paths forward and all of them are better for 
the Iranian people than the status quo. 
And preparing, as we are doing, preparing 
the transition to a New Iran is a task for 
today. We should start by securing the hu-
manitarian well-being of the Iranian people 
as they make this transition. Over the years, 
it has been demonstrated that the Iranian 
culture makes toppling governments a part 
of the national spirit. You should know that 
nearly 100% of ordinary Iranians believe the 
regime’s days are numbered. I believe that 
too. 
I am also deeply heartened by the fact that 
the Iranian people have made it abundantly 
clear that they are increasingly unafraid of 
the regime. Rather than punish Iran for its 
continued aggression against us and our 
partners in the Middle East, sadly, the Biden 
Administration is trying to get back to the 
nuclear deal with a much weaker hand. 
As was the case with the Trump Adminis-
tration, human rights and counter terrorism 
should be at the forefront of our policy, not 
appeasing the Iranian regime. 
We worked tirelessly to keep Iran from 
having a nuclear weapon and a nuclear pro-
gram. We have to apply pressure until they 
change, or until reforms which move Iran to-
ward a democratic form of government take 
place. We cannot shower the Ayatollah with 
money and economic benefits in the hopes 
that they won’t be used to inflict terror and 
oppression. We have seen this sad story be-
fore. This thinking is foolish and backwards. 
The program of sanctions and pressure that 
was employed by the Trump Administration 
needs to remain the model if we want to en-
sure the security of the American people and 
the freedom of the people of Iran. 
I pray that the United States will not in-
crease the resources the Ayatollah has at his 
disposal to do empower the theocracy. En-
gagement with the regime will lengthen the 
time that Iran and the regime has to behave 
as it has for these past decades denying basic 
human dignity 
Remember, the Ayatollah’s power grab was 
not so much a revolution but a devolution. 
It’s important to remember that. It was a 
lesson for me that I learned. And I must say 
I am hopeful. I am hopeful that the world 
has learned much about the theocracy in 
Iran these past few years. And it’s not that 
we didn’t know it before; you have all seen it 
before. Around the world, you can see that 
even in Europe the tide of tolerance for the 
regime is slipping. This is a good thing. 
We must continue to support the Iranian 
people as they fight for a freer and more 
democratic Iran in any way that they can. 
There is so much good work to do, and you 
all are doing today. 
In the end the Iranian people will have a 
secular, democratic, non-nuclear Republic. I 
pray that this day will come soon. It is a 
such a joy to be with you all today. I pray 
that these days will come soon with the Ira-
nian people with the support of Iranians liv-
ing all around the world—and those who re-
sist from within, they are noble people—that 
day will come sooner. I am committed to 
this cause; I know you everyone in this room 
is as well. May your mission be blessed, and 
the Iranian people protected and provided for 
always. It is a hopeful time, a deeply hopeful 
time, and a time to redouble our efforts. 
Thank you for having me here today. God 
bless you, and may God bless the Iranian 
people.’’
