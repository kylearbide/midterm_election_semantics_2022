how You have sustained our Nation in 
the past, we trust Your providence to

OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday evening, as everyone knows, the 
group of bipartisan Senators working 
on infrastructure finished the text of 
the bill. I immediately moved to make 
that text the base of the bill here on 
the floor, as promised. 
Last night, Democrats offered to 
begin the amendment process right 
away. 
There 
are 
three 
bipartisan 
amendments to the bill ready to con-
sider. Two were led by Republicans: a 
Rounds-Smith amendment and Thune- 
Tester amendment, and another from 
Senators PADILLA and MORAN. 
Let me be clear. These three amend-
ments would constitute only the first

tranche of potential amendments. The 
Senate can and should consider more 
amendments afterward. 
I encourage Senators from both sides 
of the aisle to submit potential amend-
ments to the bill. And, as we have al-
ready done several times this year—on 
the anti-Asian hate crimes bill and the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, 
just to name two examples—the major-
ity will work with the minority to put 
together packages of amendments for 
the Senate to vote on. 
At the moment, we need consent 
from our Republican colleagues to 
start the amendment process, and we 
await their answer. I hope we can use 
our time in the Senate efficiently. 
Let’s start voting on amendments. 
The longer it takes to finish the bill, 
the longer we will be here. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
number of our colleagues in both par-
ties worked through the weekend to fi-
nalize their draft agreement on a major 
bill for our Nation’s infrastructure. I 
want to thank the Senators who 
worked hard and long to get this effort 
this far already. 
I am confident that out of the 100 of 
us who serve in this body, 100 will be 
able to find parts of the legislation 
that we wish were different. But I be-
lieve our colleagues’ draft text pro-
vides a good and important jumping-off 
point for what needs to be a robust and 
bipartisan process out here on the 
floor. 
Infrastructure is exactly the kind of 
subject that Congress should be able to 
address 
across 
the 
aisle. 
Roads, 
bridges, 
waterways, 
airports—these 
things are not luxuries for the greatest 
Nation in world history. They are ne-
cessities. 
Necessarily, legislation like this will 
be big and complex. It will necessarily 
affect all 50 States. That is why, while 
I salute the hard work of our col-
leagues who produced the base text 
that is now before us, their conversa-
tions can’t be the Senate’s last word. 
Senators on both sides expect and de-
serve opportunities to have a say and 
to put their own State’s imprints on 
this major bill. 
Just as infrastructure itself is not a 
luxury but a necessity, the same goes 
for the Senate having a robust and bi-
partisan amendment process on legisla-
tion of this magnitude. 
Our full consideration of this bill 
must not be choked off by any artifi-
cial timetable that our Democratic col-
leagues may have penciled out for po-
litical purposes. Our bipartisan nego-
tiators have already been taking this 
task very seriously. The American peo-
ple need the Senate to continue taking 
it seriously, as well. 
On another matter, this bipartisan 
work on infrastructure just reinforces 
the recklessness of the purely partisan 
taxing-and-spending spree the Demo-
crats want to ram through next. 
Even before we get to this week, 
there is ample evidence the Senate is 
fully capable of passing policies that 
are actually smart, that actually make 
things better for American families, 
and to do so with bipartisan majorities. 
A year and a half ago, the Senate 
turned a blank sheet of paper into the 
CARES Act that saved our healthcare 
system, saved our economy, and poured 
money into Operation Warp Speed to 
help unlock vaccines in record time— 
overwhelming bipartisan support. 
A year ago, we passed the Great 
American Outdoors Act, a historic in-
vestment in our Nation’s national 
parks and national treasures—another 
very large bipartisan vote. Last De-
cember, there was yet another bipar-
tisan COVID rescue package, and just a 
few months ago, Senators once again 
compromised and passed a big bipar-
tisan bill addressing American com-
petitiveness versus China. 
There is nothing stopping policies 
from earning bipartisan support here in 
the Senate, when they deserve it. Bills 
that deserve to pass the Chamber are 
not having a hard time passing. 
So the fact that our Democratic col-
leagues will immediately pivot to a 
staggering, 
reckless, 
tax-and-spend 
spree that will not earn a single Repub-
lican vote, well, that tells Americans 
everything they need to know. 
This 50–50 Senate, a very narrowly di-
vided House, and a President who 
promised unity and togetherness have 
decided they want to respond to an en-
vironment of uncertainty and inflation 
with a sprawling $3.5 trillion socialist 
shopping list and a huge set of painful 
tax hikes. That is their plan. Our 
friend and colleague, the junior Sen-
ator from Vermont, may not have won 
the Democratic Presidential nomina-
tion, but his ideology sure has won the 
war. 
So, in the next few days, the Demo-
cratic leader says they will start the 
process of ramming through this awful, 
awful package. They want to respond 
to a border crisis with amnesty. They 
want to respond to runaway inflation 
and soaring costs for families with 
even more reckless spending, printing, 
and borrowing. They want to respond 
to a growing worker shortage by turn-
ing a tax credit for working parents 
into permanent welfare with no work 
requirement. They want to respond to 
an uneasy economic recovery with 
massive tax hikes and a whole catalog 
of Green New Deal mandates and regu-
lations so Washington bureaucrats can 
run the country. 
So, if what Senate Democrats are 
planning to do next were a good idea, it 
would read like one; and it would smell 
like one; and it wouldn’t require a 
hyperpartisan high-wire act from Sen-
ate Democrats to pull it off. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
SOCIALISM 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, ‘‘social-
ism,’’ it is a label we hear a lot. It has 
been around a while—a long time—but 
in American politics, it is kind of ap-
plied in an unusual way. The notion 
that every American would pay into an 
insurance fund so that everyone who 
retired could live in basic dignity—we 
called it Social Security as Democrats; 
the Republicans called it socialism. 
Do they want to remove Social Secu-
rity as a socialist program? I don’t 
know. I listened carefully as the Re-
publican leader started talking about 
the weaknesses of the Democratic phi-
losophy. 
And then, in the 1960s, Lyndon Baines 
Johnson looked around America and 
saw a new class of impoverished Ameri-
cans growing by the day. They were 
our parents and grandparents. And he 
decided one of their biggest problems 
was paying for their medical expenses 
and their prescription drugs eventu-
ally. So he proposed a Federal program 
called 
Medicare 
for 
everyone 
who 
reached the age of 65 in America, re-
gardless of whether they were rich or 
poor. Boy, think about that. 
The critics called that socialism—the 
notion that we would help everybody, 
that we would collect money during 
their work experience and then take 
care of our parents and grandparents so 
they could live longer, more independ-
ently. Socialism. 
Now, we are discussing—and we are 
at an early stage—changing that Medi-
care Program to extend its benefits to 
include fundamental and basic things 
that have been sitting there for dec-
ades waiting to be addressed. Eye-
glasses, hearing aids, dental work—we 
know what a difference those things 
make in the lives of everyone but how 
critically important they are to those 
who are elderly. 
And, yes, the junior Senator from 
Vermont has proposed that we extend 
Medicare benefits to include those pro-
tections, but he is not alone. Moderates 
within the Democratic caucus across 
the board agree, it is time to take a se-
rious look at that, and the Republican 
leader tells us we are flirting with so-
cialism again. 
I don’t think that a poor, elderly per-
son without dentures who can’t eat 
their food can be ignored—or that help-
ing them is socialism. 
I might add one thing that is impor-
tant. He cites the CARES Act. I re-
member it well. It was a little over a 
year ago, it was last year. The pan-
demic was just kicking off, and it was 
proposed. This CARES Act, it was over 
$1 trillion. It might have been the big-
gest bill when it was passed. It was pro-
posed with the Trump administration, 
with a Democratic Congress, and it 
ended up with a strong bipartisan roll-
call. I voted for it. Virtually every

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5531 
August 2, 2021 
Democratic Senator joined every Re-
publican Senator to make it a reality: 
billions of dollars to deal with the pan-
demic. Socialist? I don’t think so. It 
was America coming together to ad-
dress a crisis. That is exactly what 
happened. 
So what happened when we had a new 
President, when Donald Trump was 
gone—and, yes, he is gone, despite the 
fact that he doesn’t know it. What hap-
pened when we had a new President 
who decided he wanted to put together 
a rescue plan? This rescue plan ad-
dressed some fundamentals. It ad-
dressed 
the 
promise 
that 
Donald 
Trump made, that $1,400 was coming to 
families. Really? Sounds socialistic to 
me. 
But it was the Trump idea and it was 
the Biden rescue plan that pulled it off. 
And the vaccines—and we can only 
thank the Lord and the great research-
ers who put that together—but it was 
only just a theory and inventory. But 
President Biden found a way to admin-
ister the COVID–19 vaccines across 
America, a dramatic effort. That was 
paid for by the American Rescue Plan. 
And the money loans for businesses to 
get started after the pandemic, money 
for schools to make sure they are safe 
when the kids return to them this fall. 
When the American Rescue Plan was 
put together by President Biden and of-
fered in this Chamber, I am sorry to re-
port that not one Republican Senator 
supported it. I hope they have had sec-
ond 
thoughts 
since 
then. 
Admin-
istering the vaccines has given us hope 
in America, and I hope more people 
will take advantage of it. But that was 
bipartisanship 
that 
really 
hit 
the 
rocks. It took the Democrats and 
KAMALA HARRIS to make a difference. 
When I hear about socialism and bi-
partisanship from the other side, how 
far would they go in ending programs 
which have historically been labeled as 
‘‘socialistic’’? 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, on a completely dif-
ferent topic but somehow related, Sen-
ators spend a lot of time in airports 
and in airplanes, even in COVID–19 
times. The Presiding Officer knows 
that well. I spend a lot of time in air-
ports. O’Hare, I can take you on a tour. 
Springfield is a small airport. Reagan 
National Airport here, I am familiar 
with it as well. 
But I always thought to myself, as I 
traveled years ago, that one of the 
worst airports in America, sadly, was 
LaGuardia. 
Oh, 
what 
a 
wreck. 
LaGuardia was just way underutilized 
and lacked all the modern develop-
ments we expect at an airport, but, lo 
and 
behold, 
that 
has 
changed. 
LaGuardia is finished now, and it is 
beautiful. It has many things that 
many airports would only aspire to 
have, as it should, because it is not 
only serving a great city, but it is also 
named after a great man, Fiorello La 
Guardia. 
He stood 5-foot-2, but he was a giant. 
As mayor of New York City during the 
Great Depression and World War II, he 
took on political corruption and orga-
nized crime. He did some things that 
are still talked about. When the news-
paper workers went on strike, he read 
the funnies to the kids so they could 
keep up with them. 
He did something else, too. He 
oversaw investment in public works, 
including investments in roads, high-
ways, and tunnels, that changed the 
landscape of America’s largest city. 
Fiorello La Guardia famously said: 
‘‘There is no Democrat or Republican 
way to fix a pothole.’’ 
He understood, when it comes to the 
most basic responsibilities of govern-
ment, political labels shouldn’t matter. 
Building and maintaining roads and 
bridges helps all of us. 
I think Mayor Fiorello La Guardia 
would be happy to know that we have 
created a blueprint for America’s eco-
nomic future. Against the odds, we now 
have before us a bipartisan plan to 
build the physical backbone of the 21st 
century American economy. In these 
times when there is so much political 
disagreement, just getting this far is a 
remarkable achievement. I look for-
ward to a productive debate and hope-
fully a vote this week. I am hopeful we 
can meet the deadline because the fact 
is, America can’t wait any longer for 
this Senate to take action. Our roads 
and bridges are crumbling beneath our 
feet. 
Last week, I brought to this floor a 
photo of a bridge that collapsed 2 
weeks ago in a small rural town in Illi-
nois known as Seneca. A man was driv-
ing his pickup truck across the bridge 
when the bridge collapsed. The picture 
showed his red pickup truck precar-
iously straddling the two halves of the 
broken bridge. Luckily, some Good Sa-
maritans came to his rescue. 
Any of us, at any time, could be that 
man on the bridge. More than 47,000 
American bridges are judged to be 
structurally deficient, including 2,000 
in my State of Illinois. The legislation 
we are voting on this week will start to 
repair them. It includes the largest in-
vestment in American bridges since the 
creation of the Interstate Highway 
System. Imagine that. 
It also includes the largest invest-
ment in clean water infrastructure 
ever. Do we need it? Well, think of 
Flint, MI, and think of the story today 
in the Chicago papers about the dis-
covery of PFOS contamination in 
water supplies across my State. That 
isn’t all. 
We can replace the old lead service 
lines that poison drinking water. So 
many 
homes 
and 
businesses 
and 
schools and churches are served by lead 
pipe service lines, and there is no toler-
able amount of lead that can be in 
water. 
I want to thank my colleague TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH. She has been a real leader 
on this issue, and I think all of us owe 
her a debt of gratitude that it is in-
cluded in this legislation. 
Chicago has more miles of lead water 
pipes than any city in America. I am 
not bragging. I am just stating facts. 
But Chicago isn’t alone. These lead 
pipes are in big cities and small towns 
all across the Nation. Listen to this. 
The bipartisan plan includes the larg-
est investment in passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak in the 1960s. 
You 
know 
President 
Joe 
Biden 
wouldn’t forget Amtrak, nor would 
TOM CARPER or CHRIS COONS. It is the 
largest investment in public transit in 
American history. I was just out at the 
ribbon-cutting—well, several recently 
in Chicago. Naturally, people were not 
riding the CTA and Metro and other 
rail opportunities as they once did be-
cause of COVID–19, but it is coming 
back, and we want to make sure those 
stations are safe and make sure they 
are accessible for people with disabil-
ities. 
With this bill, in my State, the Chi-
cago Transit Authority and transit 
agencies downstate will be able to buy 
new, more efficient buses and railcars 
and modernize tracks and rail stations. 
It will expand the capacity of the blue 
line at O’Hare, completing the red line 
south extension, which has been a 
dream for decades. 
This plan includes $25 billion to mod-
ernize 
Illinois’ 
airports, 
including 
money for O’Hare’s terminal expan-
sion. Believe me, we can use it. We 
have done a lot with the runways— 
magnificent investments there. Now, 
we have got to make sure the termi-
nals keep up with that modernization. 
Remember the cargo ship that ran 
aground at the Suez Canal, causing 
major delays worldwide in shipping, 
costing companies and, ultimately, 
customers millions of dollars? Well, 
this 
infrastructure 
plan 
will 
keep 
America’s economy moving and our 
shipping lanes open by modernizing our 
ports, locks, and dams. 
We are not just repairing old infra-
structure; we are building new infra-
structure. This plan includes the larg-
est investment in clean energy in infra-
structure in America’s history. If there 
was ever a moment in time—with the 
world literally burning up—for us to 
get serious about climate change, this 
is that moment, and this investment 
responds to it. 
In America, the biggest source of 
greenhouse gases is transportation. We 
can change it. This plan is a start. 
In the town of Normal, IL—yes, there 
is a Normal, IL—a company called 
Rivian 
bought 
an 
old, 
abandoned 
Mitsubishi automobile factory 5 years 
ago. They now have started production 
on electric cars and delivery vans, the 
cars of the future. 
Is this going to go anywhere? Does 
anybody believe in electric vehicles? 
Well, 15 percent of Rivian is owned by 
Ford Motor Company. If you have 
heard of a company called Amazon, 
they invested $1 billion in Rivian. They 
ordered 120,000 delivery vans. There are 
2,000 people working there now, twice 
the number who were working when 
Mitsubishi left. They aspire to double

that number again and to make pro-
duction really accessible all across the 
country. 
That is not the only story I could tell 
about electric vehicles. Illinois is in a 
position to be a global leader in elec-
tric cars. Argonne National Laboratory 
in the Chicagoland area has really led 
American research in battery tech-
nology and recycling batteries. That is 
the future. If you don’t believe me, just 
watch the ads on television where they 
are advertising the new Ford F–150 
Lightning, an electric truck. They 
don’t have any available now, but they 
invite you to sign up to buy one next 
year. 
With this plan, we can build a net-
work of electric vehicle charging sta-
tions, where drivers can charge their 
cars for a fraction of what it costs to 
fill a gas tank today and without the 
harmful emissions. It really is the fu-
ture that we are trying to assist with 
this important infrastructure bill. 
Importantly, this plan will help con-
nect every American to reliable high- 
speed internet. Over 60 percent of the 
American people say that access to 
high-speed internet is as important as 
electricity to them and some say it is 
even more important than water. It 
has become that integral to a success-
ful life for business. No matter where 
you live, the internet puts the world at 
your fingertips. Your children can 
learn from home, you can connect to 
healthcare providers when you need 
them, and businesses can reach the 
global marketplace. 
One last point. This plan will help us 
protect America’s infrastructure, our 
economy, and American families from 
21st-century threats of climate change, 
extreme weather, and cyber attacks. It 
is the largest investment in resilience 
of physical and natural systems in 
American history. 
With this plan, we can create thou-
sands 
of 
good-paying, 
family-sup-
porting jobs, and the majority of these 
jobs may not require a college degree. 
Perhaps that 2 extra years of commu-
nity college, which we hope to include 
in the next bill, will be just what a per-
son needs to get a good-paying job, set-
tle down, and raise a family—the 
American dream. And we can lay the 
foundation for a long-term economic 
boom if everyone pulls together. 
These are smart, prudent, necessary 
investments that will pay dividends for 
years to come. I want to thank the 
President. He was really all in in the 
negotiation of this bill. Without his 
leadership, we wouldn’t be here. I also 
want to thank the bipartisan group of 
Senators who worked with the White 
House to produce this agreement. I 
have come to know them. I partici-
pated in some of the early meetings 
and listened to them through the delib-
eration. There were times when I want-
ed to wring their necks, and there were 
times when I wanted to pat their 
backs. But they never quit trying, and 
today, we have a bill before us that is 
a dramatic achievement, and it is a bi-
partisan achievement. 
I think the number was 17 of the Re-
publicans who voted for us to move for-
ward on this debate. I hope those 17 can 
hold together with the Democrats to 
see this bill to its successful conclu-
sion. 
Remember 
Fiorello 
La 
Guardia’s 
statement that there is no Democratic 
or Republican way to fill a pothole? 
But there is a smart way to build the 
physical backbone of an economy. This 
is the right start. This bipartisan plan 
hits the sweet spot. I thank our many 
Republican colleagues who have joined 
with the Democrats to advance this de-
bate. Isn’t that what America has been 
waiting for? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. While he is still on the 
floor, I want to thank my friend and 
colleague. He and I came together in 
the House of Representatives a million 
years ago. We were part of the class of 
1982, a huge class—over 80 Democrats 
and Republicans. It has been a joy to 
serve with him, and I especially am 
proud of him—the words he has just 
said here today, healing words, uniting 
words—and we are grateful for his lead-
ership. 
Colleagues, the Senate is now consid-
ering the substitute amendment to 
H.R. 3684, the INVEST Act, and I rise 
today to urge our colleagues to join 
Senator CAPITO, who is sitting to my 
right, and me in debating the legisla-
tion, 
offering 
improvements 
where 
needed to it, and then voting for its 
adoption. 
In February of this year, at my en-
couragement, President Biden invited 
Senator 
CAPITO, 
Senators 
CARDIN, 
INHOFE, and me, all senior members of 
the Senate Committee on Environment 
and Public Works, over to the White 
House right after he was inaugurated 
President to discuss the need to make 
bold investments in our Nation’s crum-
bling infrastructure. 
Sitting in the Oval Office that day, 
as I am sure the ranking member of 
our committee remembers, we were 
joined in person by the Vice President 
of the United States, KAMALA HARRIS, 
and we were joined virtually by Sec-
retary 
of 
Transportation 
Pete 
Buttigieg. I still want to call him 
Mayor Pete, but he has actually turned 
out to be a pretty good Secretary of 
Transportation as well. 
Because of our committee’s long-
standing tradition of bipartisan work 
on infrastructure, my colleagues and I 
already knew as we headed into the 
White House meeting that our Nation 
had fallen woefully short—woefully 
short—in maintaining and developing 
the critical infrastructure that sup-
ports us, our families, and our econ-
omy. But don’t take my word for it. 
Don’t take my word for it. The Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers’ 2021 re-
port card for America’s infrastructure 
gave our Nation’s infrastructure an 
overall grade of C-minus. In recent 
years, that rating has been as low as D- 
plus, a D, D-minus. Still, a C-minus is 
nothing to brag about; rather, it is a 
wake-up call to get our act together at 
a time, if you will, to move it on up. 
Move it on up. 
That is what our new President 
called on us to do that day in order to 
help America move on up and move 
ahead. Without casting aspersions or 
affixing blame, he made it clear that 
America hadn’t been getting the job 
done on this front for years and that by 
working together—working together— 
we could do something about it, while 
creating millions of new jobs—a lot of 
them without college degrees—at the 
same time. 
He asked us—leaders on the Senate 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works—he asked us to help jump-start 
the effort by getting to work on 
crafting and reporting to the full Sen-
ate surface transportation legislation, 
along with legislation to repair and up-
grade drinking water and water sanita-
tion infrastructure, as soon as we 
could. 
Working together with all 20 mem-
bers of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee—10 Democrats, 10 
Republicans—that is exactly what we 
did in record time and with record lev-
els, historic levels, of investment. 
After soliciting input, I am sure my 
colleague from West Virginia recalls, 
from all 50 States—all 50 States—we 
crafted and then unanimously for-
warded our water infrastructure bill 
out of committee to the full Senate— 
unanimously. There, it was debated, 
amended, and adopted by a vote of 89 to 
2—89 to 2; you don’t hear that every 
day—on April 29, 2021. 
With that behind us, we turned our 
attention to surface transportation 
legislation—roads, highways, bridges, 
climate—and 
unanimously 
reported 
our surface transportation bill to the 
full Senate by Memorial Day, the fast-
est the committee has ever acted, I am 
told, on such legislation. 
I have thanked Senator CAPITO so 
many times, she is probably getting 
sick of it, but I want to thank her 
again, and I want to thank every mem-
ber of our committee with whom we 
were privileged to serve on the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee, 
along with the members of our staffs, 
some of whom are gathered here today, 
for their remarkable work on these im-
portant, bipartisan bills. 
Speaking of staff, I look over my 
shoulder, and I see of our people right 
behind me. I look over the other shoul-
der, and I see some Republican staff 
over on the other side. 
I especially want to pause and just 
thank our Environment and Public 
Works staff director, Mary Frances 
Repko; our chief counsel, Greg Dotson; 
as well as Rebecca Higgins, who leads 
our transportation team; and Kenneth 
Martin and Jordan Baugh as well. 
A special thank-you to John Kane 
and Annie D’Amato, who ably led our 
efforts on water infrastructure; to 
Laura Haynes Gillam, our leader on

climate; and finally to my indefati-
gable chief of staff, Emily Spain. I 
practiced that word all night to make 
sure I got it right. 
I hasten to add that we couldn’t get 
any of this done without Senator CAP-
ITO and the strong, bipartisan support 
we received from her, from the EPW 
minority staff director—I see him sit-
ting over there—Adam Tomlinson— 
Adam, thank you—and his hard-work-
ing team; I won’t mention them all, 
but Murphie Barrett, affectionately 
known as Murphie Brown, and Travis 
Cone and Jess Kramer. 
You know, you would expect the 
chair of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee or the ranking mem-
ber to be proud of their committee’s 
work, and we certainly are, but we 
aren’t the only ones who have worked 
hard to write the legislation that is be-
fore us today, not by a long shot. 
I want to commend the bipartisan 
work of the Commerce Committee and 
the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, along with the efforts of 
the Banking Committee. 
I especially want to thank the bipar-
tisan group we affectionately refer to— 
Senator DURBIN already has—affection-
ately refer to them, at least most of 
the time, as the G–22, led by Senators 
ROB
PORTMAN
of Ohio and KYRSTEN 
SINEMA of Arizona. I want to thank 
them and the other 20 Senators—half 
Democrat, half Republican—for their 
Herculean efforts to make this com-
promise legislation a reality; working 
not just with folks here and over in the 
House but also at the White House as 
well, with the President and the Presi-
dent’s team. 
In the Navy, we have—one of my fa-
vorite sayings in the Navy is ‘‘Bravo 
Zulu.’’ When somebody does extraor-
dinary work, what we would say is 
‘‘Bravo Zulu.’’ I would certainly say 
that on this occasion. 
Of course, we all recognize that infra-
structure 
encompasses 
much 
more 
than 
water, 
roads, 
highways, 
and 
bridges. In truth, it touches on the ju-
risdictions of many of our commit-
tees—many of our committees. That is 
why the legislation we are considering 
today is extraordinary. It is a com-
prehensive infrastructure investment 
package that encompasses water, high-
ways, roads, bridges, transit, rail, air-
ports, ports, power systems, dams, 
broadband, cyber security, ecosystem 
restoration, and more. 
I would like to pause here for just a 
moment to remind all of us who serve 
in this body, along with the people we 
are privileged to represent, that infra-
structure is also intensely personal, 
and when it does not work, our people 
suffer, their children suffer, and their 
livelihoods suffer. We all know that 
those who suffer most are those who 
have been shortchanged by the pat-
ently inadequate investments we have 
made for too many years. 
In rural parts of Southern Delaware, 
communities like Ellendale have strug-
gled for years to find and afford safe al-
ternatives 
to 
increasingly 
polluted 
drinking water wells. Ellendale is not 
alone. Across our country, hundreds, 
maybe 
thousands 
of 
communities 
struggle with access to clean water and 
wastewater treatment, including my 
native West Virginia, now represented 
by our colleagues SHELLEY CAPITO and 
JOE MANCHIN. 
Our communities across this country 
are torn asunder by—too many places 
across this country are torn asunder by 
highways that have divided and dis-
rupted neighborhoods across our Na-
tion. In my hometown of Wilmington, 
DE, construction of I–95 literally tore 
communities apart, cutting off access 
to neighbors, parks, and economic op-
portunity. We can begin to heal those 
wounds—in places like Baltimore and 
Philadelphia 
as 
well—heal 
those 
wounds with the projects we enable in 
this legislation. 
The truth be known, almost all of 
our colleagues have stories like this to 
share—communities beset by raging 
wildfires fueled by climate change; 
thousands of acres of farmland lost to 
flooding; more than a third of the crops 
in Iowa destroyed by hurricane-force 
winds last year; kids without access to 
the internet for want of broadband ac-
cess; and families struggling to deal 
with legacy pollutants in the land and 
water where they live. 
In the near future, I hope we will 
take some time to celebrate the sig-
nificant steps we are taking to rewrite 
these stories with this legislation be-
fore us. But I want to take a moment 
or two here today, if I may, to drill 
down into some of the most meaningful 
provisions reported unanimously out of 
our committee, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, this year. 
Let’s start with the Drinking Water 
and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 
2021. 
It is clear that the programs we have 
now, despite our best efforts, aren’t 
sufficient to meet the needs of many of 
our communities, particularly those 
who simply can’t afford to participate 
in the revolving loan programs of their 
States in order to upgrade increasingly 
inadequate drinking water and waste-
water facilities. 
As our ranking member knows, if 
communities borrow money out of the 
revolving funds, water funds—one for 
drinking water and one for sanitation, 
water 
sanitation—the 
communities 
that borrow money, take money out of 
them, they are expected to pay that 
money back. There are, as we know, a 
lot of communities that are just too 
impoverished to ever do that. We have 
decided not just to bemoan that but to 
actually do something about it. That is 
what we have done with this legisla-
tion—provide them with an oppor-
tunity to receive a grant to clean up 
their water, their drinking water, and 
to deal with their wastewater. Millions 
of Americans are going to be able to do 
that, to deal with these challenges, and 
we are going to help. 
This bipartisan legislation works to 
address this crisis by authorizing more 
than $55 billion—$55 billion—for pro-
grams that will create jobs and make 
our communities healthier by building, 
repairing, upgrading, and modernizing 
our Nation’s aging drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure systems—$55 
billion dollars. 
Here is how. First, the measure takes 
the historic step of reauthorizing the 
Clean Water State Revolving Loan 
Fund for the first time in 35 years—35 
years. It does so while increasing fund-
ing levels for the first time since 1987. 
This legislation also reauthorizes the 
Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, 
a program whose reauthorization ex-
pires at the end of this year. You will 
recall that this is the fund that helps 
to ensure that clean water flows from 
our faucets when we turn on the spigot. 
To help resolve a historic injustice in 
water infrastructure investment, more 
than 40 percent of this bill’s invest-
ments are targeted to help disadvan-
taged communities. The bill appro-
priates $15 billion in new funding to re-
place lead service lines. And particu-
larly for our country’s rural areas, in-
cluding Native Alaskan villages, Tribal 
communities, and low-income neigh-
borhoods, our bill invests another $1 
billion in programs to connect house-
holds to drinking water and waste-
water systems and services. 
This legislation does far more than 
just fix what is broken. To borrow a 
phrase from our President, it truly 
does enable us to build back better by 
fortifying water infrastructure in the 
face of our new and worsening climate 
reality. 
Sadly—sadly—our future is one with 
more severe weather events like hurri-
canes, like floods, droughts, and bit-
terly cold weather. I wish it weren’t 
true, but it is. It is a future with ever 
more people living on the frontlines of 
sea level rise, like Louisiana, which, on 
average, if you can believe this, Lou-
isiana loses a piece of land to the sea 
roughly the size of a football field 
every 100 minutes—every 100 minutes. 
To that end, the bill before us pro-
vides a combined $500 million to make 
our water infrastructure system more 
resilient and more adaptable in the 
face of extreme weather events. Within 
that historic investment is a new $125 
million program which will for the first 
time provide grants to communities 
seeking to fortify their wastewater sys-
tems against climate change’s impacts. 
This is not just a bill to spend and 
build but legislation that will direct 
our Agencies to build and spend more 
wisely. We know that investment and 
innovation as envisioned in this bill be-
fore us can have a profound impact on 
our economy, creating jobs and fos-
tering growth for entire communities. 
We can, in short, seize the day in the 
face of so much adversity. Seize the 
day. Carpe diem—or, as we say in Dela-
ware, Carper diem. 
It is fair to say there is also much we 
can and will do to invest in our Na-
tion’s highways, roads, and bridges. 
Our Surface Transportation Reauthor-
ization Act increases the baseline for

August 2, 2021 
funding our surface transportation pro-
grams by more than one-third to $303 
billion over the next 5 years—$303 bil-
lion. On top of that, the legislation will 
invest over $60 billion in new funds for 
roads, bridges, and multimodal pro-
grams over these 5 years. This invest-
ment will repair and rebuild our roads 
and bridges with a new focus on cli-
mate change mitigation, resilience, eq-
uity, and safety for all users, including 
cyclists and pedestrians. 
Every day, motorists cross bridges in 
poor conditions in too many parts of 
our country 170 million times. Every 
day. Every day. A hundred and seventy 
million times a day. Some 40 percent of 
the bridges in our country are in need 
of repair or replacement, including 
nearly 500 bridges in Massachusetts, 
3,000 in Pennsylvania, and God knows, 
more in our State as well. 
At the current pace of investment in 
bridges, it would take nearly 40 years— 
40 years—to tackle the current backlog 
of bridges in poor condition. That is 
right—40 years. That is why today we 
consider legislation to provide a $40 
billion 
investment 
to 
address 
our 
daunting bridge repair backlog. 
Our legislation also includes for the 
first time in a Senate reauthorization 
bill a climate title with provisions 
dedicated to curbing harmful green-
house gas emissions, while ensuring 
that the investments we make are 
more resilient to climate change-en-
hanced extreme weather events be-
cause, like it or not, it is coming our 
way. 
As many of you know, the transpor-
tation sector is the largest source of 
carbon emissions in our Nation; almost 
30 percent just from one source: cars, 
trucks, and vans. If we want to save 
our planet, and we do, for our children 
and grandchildren, we have to tackle 
this major contributor to the climate 
crisis with a special zeal. 
The bill we marked up in our com-
mittee, the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, this spring by, 
again, a 20-to-0 vote put us on the right 
track, dedicating $18 billion toward re-
ducing our carbon emissions and in-
cluding $2.5 billion for building electric 
vehicle charging and hydrogen fueling 
stations on highways and in locations 
like schools, workplaces, parks, and 
publicly accessible areas for commu-
nities. This bill also adds another $5 
billion for EV charging and hydrogen 
fueling stations to help us transition to 
a zero-emission future. 
A lot of people have heard about and 
talked about electric vehicle charging 
stations. Not so many people have 
mentioned hydrogen. Hydrogen is a big 
part and will play a major role in re-
ducing our carbon emissions, particu-
larly with midsized trucks and larger 
trucks, and also when we talk about re-
ducing carbon emissions in the indus-
trial sector. So stay tuned. There is a 
lot more to come on that front. 
A great thing about our clean hydro-
gen investment in vehicles propelled 
with hydrogen, with the technology 
that we have developed, it creates an 
emission from these vehicles, but it is 
water, H2O. I am told it is water we can 
actually drink. Think about that. 
We can also drive down emissions and 
curb pollution by supporting conven-
ient, healthy alternatives to driving. 
Bicycling and walking are not only af-
fordable modes of transportation but 
healthy ones as well—an important 
consideration in a nation where all too 
many Americans are dying from med-
ical conditions tied to obesity. 
Sadly, far too many Americans live 
in neighborhoods where there are no 
safe bike lanes and crosswalks. Trag-
ically, in 2019 alone, over 7,000 pedes-
trians and bicyclists lost their lives in 
traffic 
accidents—over 
7,000 
pedes-
trians. I would wager that many Mem-
bers of this body actually knew one or 
more than one of those victims or their 
families personally. So I am grateful 
that our bill works to address these 
needless deaths head-on. The question 
is, How? By providing a 70-percent in-
crease in funding for programs that de-
velop safe, accessible pedestrian and bi-
cycle pathways across our Nation and 
by authorizing almost $17 billion in 
funding for highway safety improve-
ments. 
I also want to note here some of the 
critical investments in infrastructure 
that are outside of the EPW Committee 
jurisdiction and the important work 
that those committees did to bring this 
bill to the floor. 
First, a note of appreciation for the 
portion of the legislation that was au-
thored by the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, led by Senators MARIA CANT-
WELL and ROGER WICKER. As one of the 
tens of thousands of Americans who 
commute to work on the east coast by 
taking Amtrak almost daily, I am en-
couraged to see that this bill invests in 
our railways across the Nation. This 
legislation not only provides $6 billion 
in grants to the Northeast Corridor to 
address 
Amtrak’s 
deferred 
mainte-
nance needs, it also provides another 
$16 billion for Amtrak’s national net-
work and another $41 billion in grants 
to improve passenger rail performance 
and safety. 
I also want to applaud the chairman 
of the Senate Banking Committee and 
others both on and off the committee 
who worked tirelessly to advance ro-
bust funding for public transit infra-
structure in order to make it possible 
for millions of people to get to work 
and home again every day. 
Transit and rail are both critical 
components of our climate change re-
sponse, providing low- and zero-emis-
sion travel choices. This bill, our bill, 
reauthorizes and grows our transit pro-
grams, while also providing more than 
$5 billion in grants for State and local 
agencies to purchase electric and low- 
emission transit buses. 
Our colleagues on the Senate Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, led 
by Senators MANCHIN and BARRASSO, 
crafted legislation to help support and 
clean up our Nation’s energy infra-
structure. Investments made in this 
bill will work to make our electric grid 
more reliable and resilient, support 
families and businesses to become 
more energy efficient, while helping to 
clean up our Nation’s old and aban-
doned mines and wells that leak toxic 
pollution and methane emissions. 
The bill before us this week also in-
cludes investments in battery recy-
cling and zero-emitting technologies, 
including a program much like the one 
passed out of our EPW Committee last 
year that supports our existing nuclear 
power fleet, which collectively pro-
duces—get this—half of our Nation’s 
carbon-free electricity. 
While there is much to celebrate in 
this product of our bipartisan efforts, 
more work still needs to be done. Col-
lectively, we have incorporated badly 
needed climate provisions in surface 
transportation, water, power, and a 
number of other infrastructure pro-
grams, but in truth, we have, in the 
words of Robert Frost, miles to go be-
fore we sleep—miles to go before we 
sleep. 
With the words of Robert Frost as a 
reminder, all of us who serve here to-
gether understand that every race won 
begins with a first step and ends with a 
final one. With the enactment of this 
legislation, we will be taking not one 
but a number of important steps—a 
number of important steps. 
In the days ahead, we will move a 
good deal closer to the finish line in a 
race with a dangerously changing cli-
mate that we simply cannot afford to 
lose. That is why I will be examining 
the budget resolution closely in the 
days ahead to ensure that we are de-
voting the resources necessary to put 
climate change on the run as we ad-
vance environmental justice. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t add that 
we must not shy away in the days 
ahead from working hard to agree on 
how to honestly and thoughtfully pay 
for the investments that need to be 
made. In the words of a colleague from 
West Virginia—words of a former State 
treasurer of a small State on the east 
coast who now serves in this body, 
‘‘Things that are worth having are 
worth paying for.’’ 
But the key message of this day is 
that we have pushed through earnest 
disagreements, varying priorities, and 
much 
headache 
and 
heartache 
to 
achieve a truly singular success in tak-
ing on a number of major infrastruc-
ture challenges facing our Nation. We 
have elected to work together to ad-
dress the obvious—to repair and up-
grade much of our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture in order to better position Amer-
ica to succeed in an ever more competi-
tive global economy and to survive in 
an ever more dangerous world due to 
the climate crisis. 
Senator CAPITO and I have served to-
gether on this Committee for a number 
of years, and she succeeds Senator 
JOHN BARRASSO, who for a number of 
years was the chair and I was the rank-
ing member. I will never forget—and

August 2, 2021 
you probably won’t either, Senator—we 
won’t forget the words of attorney Rob 
Wallace, who is also from Wyoming, a 
friend of Senator BARRASSO’s, and he 
was nominated, I think, to be Assistant 
Secretary of the Interior. He focused 
on, 
among 
other 
things, 
national 
parks, wildlife, and fish and wildlife. I 
never forget what he said in his con-
firmation hearing. He commented on 
the history and the tradition of our 
committee as one where we actually 
work together and like each other even 
though we don’t always agree on the 
issues. We work together to get things 
done. He said these words. He said: ‘‘Bi-
partisan solutions are lasting solu-
tions.’’ That is what he said. ‘‘Bipar-
tisan solutions are lasting solutions.’’ I 
thought at the time, well, he really 
nailed it. And I hope, with this legisla-
tion, we will nail it, too, because a lot 
of Americans are counting on us to do 
just that. 
With that, I am happy to yield the 
floor again to—I am tempted to call 
her our wingwoman; she calls me her 
wingman—to my colleague and friend 
and ranking member of this com-
mittee, who has been great to work 
with. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want 
to begin by thanking the chairman of 
our EPW Committee. We work tremen-
dously well together. 
He gave a great speech right there, 
outlining not only the difficulties that 
we had reaching consensus but really 
how the building blocks of what we are 
embarking on today really came from 
the bipartisanship that we have shown 
at EPW with our surface transpor-
tation and our water bills. 
I think, you know, by having those 
building blocks in place, it has led us 
to where we are today. 
And I do remember that first meeting 
with President Biden in the White 
House. It is not every day you get to go 
to the White House and sit in the Oval 
Office and talk to the President of the 
United States and Vice President. But 
we started out with basically saying 
that we can do this, we want to do this, 
and bipartisanship can work, particu-
larly on areas that we traditionally 
work together on, but also on areas 
that are of critical need to our coun-
try. And we never really sort of lost 
our focus on that, and neither did the 
President. 
So here we are today, really meeting 
that challenge that he sort of laid 
down before us over 6 months ago. And 
with the building blocks that us and 
Commerce and others have put into 
place, we find ourselves with the great 
hard work of the bipartisan group and 
a great place of—at a point at which we 
can discuss these, amend these, and 
look at these on the Senate floor, as we 
should be doing. 
So after months and months of nego-
tiating, the time is finally here. A lot 
of people, in pun, said we would never 
get here. As a matter of fact, I had an 
interview on national TV about 3 or 4 
months ago, when I was leading the ef-
fort for the Republicans, and the com-
mentator said: Well, I will believe bi-
partisanship on infrastructure when 
pigs fly. 
So watch out. They are flying. 
So we are debating this historic bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. The Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act is 
the product of countless hours, as the 
chairman said; late nights; and more 
than a couple of tough conversations. 
And I want to include not just our staff 
but a lot of staffs throughout the Sen-
ate, whether it is the Finance Com-
mittee, Approps Committee, Commerce 
Committee, Banking Committee, EPW 
Committee, Energy Committee, all-en-
compassing—a lot of our staffs have 
been working through the weekends 
sleeplessly to try to get us to today. 
We debated the definition of infra-
structure. We actually talked about 
that at the White House on the day we 
went to see the President and what 
that scope should look like and the 
pricetag and, very important, how to 
pay for it. 
I think that nobody, probably, of the 
100 of us thinks this bill is absolutely 
perfect. It never would be. And there is 
always a saying going around that, if 
we all thought it was perfect, there is 
something wrong with it. 
So delivering for the American peo-
ple is more important than our news-
paper headlines today. We can make a 
historic investment in our Nation’s in-
frastructure with this bill. It reflects 
our commitment to keeping Americans 
safe, as the chairman mentioned; im-
proving our global competitiveness; 
and growing our economy and creating 
jobs. This legislation gives States both 
the certainty in funding to plan for big 
projects, but also that flexibility in 
spending to cater to unique needs. 
What you need in Georgia is different 
than what you need in Delaware, or my 
other colleague from Montana would 
differ from what we need in West Vir-
ginia. This bill is a product that the 
American people can be proud of and 
one that will benefit them and the next 
generation. This is not a one-and-done. 
The impacts of this bill will go on 
through a generation. 
So after we had the meeting with the 
President—the bipartisan meeting—the 
President put out his American Jobs 
Act. He actually challenged my party, 
the Republican Party, to come up with 
a reaction to his American Jobs Plan. 
And I took up that challenge, along 
with the ranking members of the rel-
evant committees. So that would be 
Senators WICKER, TOOMEY, BARRASSO, 
CRAPO, and Senator BLUNT, and we 
went back to the White House. And I 
was talking to Senator CARPER the en-
tire time through this process to make 
sure that our surface transportation 
bill, which we were in the midst of ne-
gotiating, was going to be the building 
block on which we could formulate a 
bipartisan agreement. And the Drink-
ing Water and Wastewater bill had al-
ready passed out this entire body 89 to 
2. 
So we decided—and the President was 
very much in the conversation and the 
will to get this done. So our Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act had already passed, as I said, 
unanimously. We passed it on the floor, 
89 to 2. And we were making steady 
progress on our Surface Transportation 
Reauthorization bill. 
At this point, the talks between the 
President and me and our working 
group, as Republicans, began to falter, 
and the bipartisan group picked up 
with the President. I am really, really 
glad and proud of their efforts that 
they were able to come to an agree-
ment that is before us today. As I am 
going to reiterate again because I 
think we are going to be saying this a 
lot, I am glad that the basis of this are 
the two bipartisan bills that came out 
of the EPW Committee. 
There are several provisions I would 
like to highlight as we begin this proc-
ess. 
Roads and bridges are what we think 
of when we think of infrastructure. We 
talked a lot about this over the last 
several months. As ranking member of 
the EPW Committee, one of my top pri-
orities, along with Chairman CARPER, 
is the reauthorization of the Surface 
Transportation Reauthorization bill. 
We worked painstakingly; and those 
were a lot of sleepless nights, too, for 
many of us and our staffs, in par-
ticular, to write a bill to meet our 
transportation needs. And the chair-
man outlined a lot of what his prior-
ities were, and I am going to talk 
about some of what the priorities that 
I had, sharing his priorities as well. 
I came to the table with several 
major priorities for that bill, and I am 
proud to say that each one of them is 
in this bill that we are getting ready to 
consider. I wanted a robust investment 
in our Nation’s roads and bridges. 
Nothing bugs people more, literally, 
than driving into a pothole when they 
know they are paying a gas tax and 
when they know they are trying to do 
their best to support their State and 
local to repair their roads. But it is, I 
think, the least, I think, that Ameri-
cans—as they are going to work or 
going to school or going shopping— 
would expect that they could be safe as 
they are traveling. 
I came to the table, and we did a ro-
bust $303.5 billion over 5 years for the 
Federal-Aid Highway Program, which, 
as the chairman said, is a 35-percent in-
crease over current law. That invest-
ment 
represents 
historic 
funding. 
These are historic levels of funding for 
our roads and bridges and provides 
States that long-term certainty that 
they need to plan and complete a 
project. I am sure the chairman has 
projects in his State that have been on 
the burner, waiting to be done or par-
tially finished, and they can’t get the 
investment because they can’t get the

long-term investment that we provided 
in our bill. 
So I specifically made funding for our 
Nation’s bridges a priority. West Vir-
ginia has so many bridges. It is a small 
State, but we have got a lot of hills and 
valleys, so we need a lot of bridges. 
One recent report said that 21 per-
cent of West Virginia’s bridges are in 
poor condition. Another report says 
that 13 percent of our interstate 
bridges are in poor condition. So that 
latter figure of the interstate bridges is 
the highest one in the Nation. Our bill 
created a new bridge program. We 
worked hard with our colleagues to 
make sure that there is a massive infu-
sion, which there is, on top of what we 
had in our bill in the appropriations 
package. 
The overall package includes $40 bil-
lion in dedicated resources for bridges. 
This is the single largest investment in 
bridge infrastructure since the con-
struction of the Interstate Highway 
System. This is money that will make 
a difference for West Virginia and the 
rest of the Nation. 
Second, I wanted to preserve the 
flexibility for our States and localities 
to use Federal funds to meet their own 
unique transportation needs. That pri-
ority is reflected in the fact that 90 
percent of the EPW bill’s funding will 
be provided to our States through the 
formula—that means the predictability 
of the formula that every State has re-
lied on over the last several transpor-
tation bills. That is important because 
it lets States use the Federal dollars to 
address their own priorities. As I said, 
we have different priorities, from con-
gestion in urban areas to economic 
growth in small towns. 
And third, I wanted to make sure 
that all parts of our Nation—not just 
urban areas, but the rural areas—ben-
efit from transportation grant pro-
grams. Rural areas can sometimes 
struggle when it comes to receiving 
competitive grants. 
It is hard to show cost-benefit anal-
ysis. It is hard to show how many peo-
ple are being served. But these trans-
portation corridors are so vital. That is 
why I am very pleased that the EPW 
bill creates a new $2 billion rural grant 
program that will dedicate resources to 
something very important to me—the 
Appalachian 
Development 
Highway 
System, or the ADHS—and other crit-
ical projects across rural America. 
We also worked together to provide 
additional dedicated funding for the 
ADHS in the broader legislation. 
So what does that mean for my home 
State? 
That means that this funding will aid 
the completion of Corridor H, which is 
the connector to the eastern and cen-
tral parts of our State with the Metro 
and DC area and opening up more op-
portunities for economic growth and 
tourism. So if you are coming from the 
DC area, you can just slice right 
through the center of the State where 
you can ski Whitewater, see the beauty 
of our State, or bring your business. 
How about that? 
Finally, we hear a lot—everybody 
hears a lot—from folks back home that 
it just takes way too long to develop a 
project. We sometimes think some-
times the bureaucracy is our worst 
enemy when it comes to building our 
infrastructure. So we prioritized im-
provements for the project delivery 
process to help road and bridge projects 
advance from the planning stage to the 
completion stage much more rapidly. 
I am excited about reforms we had in 
our EPW bill. Particularly, our bill 
codifies the One Federal Decision pol-
icy, making it easier for project spon-
sors to work through the Federal envi-
ronmental review process—not skirting 
any environmental review, but just ex-
pediting it so it can go quicker, which 
means more development, more consid-
erations, but also more efficiency on 
how you spend your dollars. 
The EPW bill makes other common-
sense reforms, like allowing States to 
be reimbursed for utility relocation 
necessary for a project while the re-
view process is ongoing, or even estab-
lishing deadlines for Federal Agencies 
to make decisions. 
These are a few examples of the 19 
sections included in the robust project 
delivery section of our EPW bill. 
Additional provisions in the broader 
legislation will extend the FAST–41 
permitting reforms to help us build 
other types of infrastructure more effi-
ciently. 
So my key priorities: Robust invest-
ment in roads and bridges, flexibility 
for—and certainty for—our States; re-
sources for rural communities and es-
pecially the ADHS, and project deliv-
ery improvements are all reflected in 
the EPW bill and across the broader 
package we are considering. 
I am extremely proud of the work we 
did on our committee to produce this, 
and I think it will make significant 
benefits to our Nation’s infrastructure. 
I am also going to talk about our 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act. The chairman went into 
more detail on it, but you can see it is 
very far-reaching. It is the largest, 
most robust investment in new areas 
around this very crucial area. We have 
authorized 
$35 
billion 
for 
water 
projects across the country with a 
focus on upgrading aging infrastruc-
ture. It invests in innovative tech-
nologies and provides assistance to 
rural and low-income communities to 
help them keep their water safe and 
clean. The bill provides that flexibility 
I talked about so that both rural and 
urban areas can best address their 
needs. 
The most significant investments are 
in the Drinking Water and Clean Water 
State 
Revolving 
Funds, 
otherwise 
known as SRFs. Our former Governors 
in the body would know all about 
SRFs, how important they are. They 
maximize the authority to the States 
to determine how best to address their 
own challenges with a revolving loan 
fund to facilitate additional future in-
vestments. 
When this water legislation was 
voted on by the Senate, 89 Senators 
supported it. Senators recognized that 
the legislation will help thousands of 
communities to improve their health, 
safety, and standard of living. I am 
very pleased that this bill before us 
again is a part of this package—a part 
of the larger package—so we can make 
sure that it gets to the President’s 
desk. 
I am glad that the overall package 
we are considering represents the larg-
est investment in clean drinking water 
in our Nation’s history. 
It also has some niche things in there 
that are important to me. Just what 
we hear anecdotally in our State, we 
are wasting water in our State. We 
have leaky old pipes that just leak out 
50 percent of the water from the treat-
ment facilities to the home. What a 
waste. Think about our friends in the 
West and how precious water is in cer-
tain areas. What a wasteful thing that 
is. So we addressed some of that into 
our bill. 
There are a number of other provi-
sions in this large package that will be 
significant wins for West Virginia and 
the Nation. I launched my Capito Con-
nect initiative in 2015, to help expand 
broadband infrastructure in West Vir-
ginia. Many communities that lack 
adequate broadband service are strug-
gling economically. And I see my fel-
low Senator from Montana—we had 
talked about this endlessly on the 
Commerce Committee and how abso-
lutely important it is. 
Many communities that lack ade-
quate broadband service are struggling. 
It is impossible to compete for new jobs 
if a community cannot offer good 
internet service—I mean, it is just a 
necessity—causing these areas to fall 
further and further behind. So, today, 
education, tourism, healthcare, all re-
quire high-speed internet service. 
Broadband is core infrastructure, and 
this legislation recognizes that. It is a 
major broadband investment that will 
tremendously help close the digital di-
vide in this country. We will get it to 
the last house. We will get it to the 
last business. 
Additionally, significant funding is 
included in this package to improve 
our Nation’s airports. 
Funding for the Corps of Engineers 
will improve our water resources infra-
structure, our locks and dams. We rely 
a lot on that as you are going knew 
down the Ohio Canal, the Big Sandy in 
through West Virginia. 
Reorganization of the AML Program 
will provide billions of dollars to clean 
up abandoned mine sites. Another new 
program will provide resources to clean 
up orphaned oil and gas wells. Both 
programs will have a positive effect in 
this country and particularly in my 
State. 
The items I have highlighted are 
major wins for West Virginia and the 
Nation. They are investments in the 
next generation, ensuring America con-
tinues to compete on the global stage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5537 
August 2, 2021 
I would like to thank Senators 
PORTMAN and SINEMA for their leader-
ship on this legislation and the entire 
bipartisan working group for their 
hours and hours of long work. 
I would especially like to thank—and 
we are going to be together a lot here 
in the next several days—my counter-
part, ‘‘Carper diem,’’ Chairman CARPER 
of the EPW Committee. 
I would also like to thank President 
Biden for his commitment and his will-
ingness to see this bipartisan work 
product through. I would like to add 
that I would like to thank the Presi-
dent’s staff because I know that they 
have committed hours and hours to 
this effort, beginning with me and end-
ing where we are today. 
I hope this isn’t the end. I mean, I 
hope this is the beginning of things 
that we are going to be doing together. 
I hope this isn’t a one-and-done. I hope 
this is the beginning of all good things. 
The American people elected us to do 
this tough work. Tough compromises 
are necessary to develop and pass bi-
partisan bills, and I believe this legis-
lation is a major positive step. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues as we begin the amendment 
process so that we can advance this 
package. 
I would like to join with Chairman 
CARPER in thanking our staff members 
who have worked so hard on the EPW 
bill. 
As the Senator mentioned, I see his 
staff over there and part of my staff 
over here. 
At the risk of picking one of my fa-
vorite children off the EPW Com-
mittee, I am going to name my entire 
staff because they all had a hand in 
this. So I would like to thank Lauren 
Baker; 
Murphie 
Barrett; 
Libby 
Callaway; Georgianna Clemmons, who 
is going to be a mom in about a month; 
Marli 
Collier; 
Travis 
Cone; 
Sarah 
Delavan; Will Dixon; Elizabeth Horner; 
Max Hyman; Tyler Jenkins; Jess Kra-
mer; Jake Kennedy; Matt Lupes; Kayla 
McMurry; 
Taylor 
Meredith; 
Jacob 
Mitchell; 
Kelley 
Moore; 
Katherine 
Smith; and my staff leader, Adam 
Tomlinson—I will give him an extra 
check because he is an amazing per-
son—Travis Voyles; and Andy Zock for 
their tireless efforts that have helped 
advance this committee’s infrastruc-
ture legislation. 
On my personal office team, I would 
like to thank my chief of staff, Joel 
Brubaker, and JT Jezierski for their 
leadership. 
I say to the Senator that I also want 
to thank his staff. We have worked 
really well. You and I work well to-
gether, but our staffs really do, I think, 
rely on one another. And that is the 
way it should be. 
I would like to especially thank Mary 
Frances Repko because she has devoted 
many hours and time—she and Adam— 
I don’t know how many times they 
have talked on the phone, but it is 
many, many, many—Rebecca Higgins, 
John 
Kane, 
Greg 
Dotson, 
Laura 
Gilliam, Jordan Baugh, Heather Dean, 
Mackie 
McIntosh, 
Annie 
D’Amato, 
Kenneth Martin, and Tyler Hoffman- 
Reardon for their dedication for this 
process as well. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARPER. I am going to ask 
unanimous consent, if I could just in-
sert one quick comment, Mr. Presi-
dent? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Ranking Member Sen-
ator CAPITO has mentioned very gra-
ciously the names of all of our staff. 
I was here this weekend. She was 
here this weekend. And there were peo-
ple here working this weekend, not just 
our staffs on the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, not just on 
the Appropriations Committee, just 
staffs like here in this body. Folks 
throughout the building, throughout 
the complex, they were here working. 
They have children. They have spouses. 
They have parents. They have other 
obligations. They were here working. 
And we would be remiss if we didn’t 
mention that. 
The other thing I want to say is, as 
Ranking 
Member 
Senator 
CAPITO 
knows, I go back and forth on the train 
a lot of days, much like Joe Biden used 
to do. And almost every week some-
body says to me on a platform either in 
Delaware or here in DC waiting for the 
train: Why can’t you guys work to-
gether? Why can’t you folks just work 
together? 
I just wish that they could be here to 
participate, to listen, to hear that, ac-
tually, we do work together. And when 
the chips are really down—pandemic, 
terrible situation, 15, 16, 17 months’ ago 
especially, we worked together in an 
almost unanimous way. And we are 
working together here on some things 
that are extraordinarily important. 
The other thing I would say, and I re-
minded the President of this just the 
other day, this is not all on the Federal 
Government. You know, whether it is 
climate change, whether it is meeting 
our infrastructure needs, whether it is 
a pandemic, this is a shared responsi-
bility, and the Federal Government 
really bears a lot of responsibility. 
We have a responsibility especially 
to lead, but there are States involved. 
And as a recovering Governor—States 
were involved, counties, and cities. 
Nonprofits were involved. And it is all 
of us working together. 
We have a Home Depot just a couple 
of blocks from our house, Senator CAP-
ITO. And when I think of—whether it is 
cities and towns or counties where 
they have responsibilities to meet, I 
like to say: You can do it; we can help. 
Like they say at Home Depot: You can 
do it; we can help. And there is a lot of 
good help here. 
To the folks around the country who 
need the help, we are going to help. 
You can do it, but we can help, and we 
will. 
I would just say, in closing—I see the 
Senator from Montana is here, a great 
Member of this body, a great Member 
from Montana, and a great member of 
the Approps Committee, and the chair 
as well. I just want to say thank you 
for all of your involvement in this ef-
fort, all of your involvement, as part of 
this G–22, with some sanity and some 
common sense at times when it was 
really needed and just tenacity. 
The fellow who normally stands at 
this podium is our leader, Senator 
SCHUMER, our majority leader. He 
spoke earlier this morning. And Sen-
ator MCCONNELL
spoke from where 
Senator CAPITO was speaking. Not ev-
erybody expected Senator MCCONNELL, 
a Republican leader, to vote in favor of 
the motion to proceed to the bill. He 
did. And that encouraged others, 16, 17, 
18 other Republicans to join in voting 
for the motion to proceed. We don’t 
proceed unless we have 60 votes, and 
that was just hugely helpful. 
And to CHUCK
SCHUMER, who was 
just—this guy, he just doesn’t give up. 
I have known and worked with him for-
ever, and I am very proud of his leader-
ship. I know he will be glad when this 
is all over, and he can maybe go home 
and get a good night’s sleep. 
But for his family who is willing to 
share and his kids’ willingness to share 
him with all of us, especially, thanks. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I do 
want to thank Senator CARPER
and 
Senator CAPITO for managing this bill. 
I say to the Senators, I very much 
appreciate what you guys have done up 
to this point and what you are going to 
do over the next 3 or 4 days. 
Mr. President, I rise today for the 
same reason that—several months ago, 
I worked with four other Democrats 
and five Republicans to try to get 
something done to address the infra-
structure of this country. Why? Be-
cause infrastructure is important. 
Let me take you back 60 years. Sixty 
years ago, it was 131⁄2 miles to the clos-
est patch of pavement from my farm. 
Then, I was about 4 or 5 years old. I re-
member riding with my dad in a 1954 
GMC 300 truck on that dirt road haul-
ing wheat to town as he weaved around 
piles of gravel that were in the middle 
of that road. 
And I asked my father: Why are 
those piles of gravel there? 
He said: They are working to pave 
this road. 
I said: What does that mean—being a 
4-year-old. 
He said: Well, remember the stretch 
of road, the 150 or 200 yards that we 
drive on to get to the elevator right be-
fore the elevator? 
And I said: Yes. 
This road is going to be all like that. 
And I thought, wow. 
And it was. It got paved. It got paved 
for the first 8 miles out of town, and 
that was pretty neat. 
We were 51⁄2 miles from pavement 
then, which was a great improvement. 
Some 10 years later, a little more 
than 10 years later, that final 4 miles

August 2, 2021 
was paved so that we could access that 
highway. 
So why is that important? That is 
important because not only did it re-
duce our costs on the farm in things 
like tires and pins and bushings and 
ball joints, but it made our farm more 
profitable. Because of the investments 
that my grandfather and my father’s 
generation made, not only did it help 
them at the time, but it helps me to 
this day. 
That was my first introduction to in-
frastructure, and that is why, several 
months ago, I realized that after 15 
years in this body and people from both 
sides of the aisle talking about infra-
structure, that it was well past time to 
get something done on infrastructure 
because I knew it was economically 
important; I knew it would create jobs; 
and I knew it would help sustain com-
munities all across this country. 
So what is in this legislation? Why is 
this legislation so important? Well, let 
me tell you. It is about the economy. It 
is about creating jobs. It is about mak-
ing sure that we can compete in this 
worldwide economy that we live in, 
how we can maintain our position as 
the world’s premier economy in this 
world. 
So how does it do it? Well, it starts 
by repairing and modernizing our roads 
and bridges, our airports, our transit 
systems. That is critically important 
for an economy. 
In my particular case, I live a long 
ways away from our customer base. So 
when I jump in the truck and I go to 
town and I use that piece of pavement 
that was put down 50 years ago, that is 
important. When I cross that bridge 
that crosses the Marias River, when I 
haul grain to Fort Benton or Great 
Falls—without that bridge, I couldn’t 
access my markets. Without those 
highways, I cannot access my markets. 
So it is critically important we keep 
our aging bridges and roads and air-
ports up to snuff. 
And then, this also makes an incred-
ibly important investment in our aging 
water systems. Where I come from, 
they call it dryland agriculture. This 
year, it is a little dryer than we want 
because we are in the middle of a 
drought. But the truth is, even if you 
are looking for drinking water or irri-
gation water or any water, it is hard to 
come by. 
As our Native American friends have 
told us many, many times, water is 
life. And so infrastructure to get water 
to the point where we can utilize it is 
critically important. This bill is a 
major investment in water infrastruc-
ture. 
And I would say one other thing. 
Whether you live in the West or wheth-
er you live in the East, our water sys-
tems in this country are worn out be-
cause we haven’t done what our par-
ents and grandparents have done. We 
have allowed them to decay without in-
vesting in this infrastructure, which is 
what we are doing today with this 
package. 
Then 
we 
talk 
about 
broadband, 
which, if we can get this bill across the 
line, I believe it will fix the broadband 
accessibility issues in this country. 
We came through the pandemic, and 
we saw how important broadband was 
for distance learning, for telehealth, 
for opportunities for businesses to ex-
pand their customer base. This bill will 
help 
expand 
high-speed 
internet 
throughout this country, both urban 
and rural. 
I will tell you, there is a lot of work 
that needs to be done in my home 
State of Montana when it comes to 
broadband. 
Then there is the grid. If we are 
going to move forward with electric ve-
hicles—and they are coming—then we 
have to have an electrical grid that 
will support those electric vehicles. 
Without improvements to the elec-
trical grid, we will be behind the eight 
ball all the time when it comes to, for 
example, the electric pickup that Ford 
is putting out. 
I will say, in my lifetime, I will prob-
ably have an electric tractor on the 
farm because this technology is moving 
so quickly that it is real. 
This package does much more than 
that. I just wanted to touch on those 
few things. But it is done without in-
creasing your taxes, which is really im-
portant because, right now, as we see 
our economy moving forward, we need 
to keep it going in that direction. 
Ultimately, as I said before, this bill 
comes down to the economy; it comes 
down to creating jobs and putting 
America to work; and it is about our 
national security. It allows us to be 
able to compete with China in a way 
that we are losing right now. 
I have heard people come to the floor 
and say: Do you know what? Infra-
structure is good, but we don’t need it. 
We don’t need it right now. 
Well, all I have to say is, if you be-
lieve that, take the keys to the car out 
of your pocket—known as our econ-
omy—and give them to China, because 
you are giving this economy away, and 
you are going to make China the lead-
ing economic power in this world. 
Then there is the issue of bipartisan-
ship that has been talked about a lot 
today already. The truth is this bill 
has made some news because Demo-
crats and Republicans actually worked 
together. They actually compromised. 
Nobody got everything they want, but 
everybody won. 
And as I have told many media out-
lets, this shouldn’t be news, but in this 
day and age, it is. Hopefully, this will 
set an example so that we can have 
much more bipartisan legislation going 
forward. 
And, in that regard, I want to thank 
my colleagues for their dedication to 
this 
effort 
over 
the 
last 
several 
months, the G–10—Senators PORTMAN, 
SINEMA, COLLINS, WARNER, ROMNEY, 
MANCHIN, 
CASSIDY, 
SHAHEEN, 
MUR-
KOWSKI—all of you folks who sat with 
me in the same room, and we battled it 
out. Sometimes, the conversation has 
been fun. Sometimes, it has not been so 
much fun. But the truth is every one of 
these folks wanted to get to yes, and in 
the end we did get to yes. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER. I 
want to thank him for his patience, not 
something that he is known for. But he 
has been incredibly patient as this bill 
has been debated and changed and 
moved forward, particularly over the 
last week, although I will say that he 
pushed the envelope and made sure we 
were tending to business even before 
that, because I think Senator SCHUMER 
also wants to see this bill come to fru-
ition. 
I also need to thank the administra-
tion, the folks who represent President 
Biden in his negotiations. And I am 
going to name names: Louisa Terrell, 
Brian Deese, Steve Ricchetti. These 
folks were incredible resources, and 
they were incredibly helpful, and this 
bill would not have happened without 
their input. 
I also want to thank all the staff 
members, both in the personal offices 
and the committees, from both sides of 
the aisle, who gave up their weekends 
and worked late into the night over 
and over and over again. I have said 
this before. I will say it again. The 
staff does the work; the Senators take 
the credit for it. The fact is that our 
staffs really rolled up their sleeves and 
really performed in a way that every 
American would be proud. 
Look, over the next 3 or 4 days, we 
have the opportunity to prove that the 
U.S. Senate can do big things and still 
function. The process we have been 
through hasn’t been pretty. I don’t 
think it is supposed to be pretty. But it 
has been worth the while. 
I would say the world is watching, 
both our allies and our adversaries. Our 
allies want us to succeed. Our adver-
saries want us to fail. I would say to 
everybody in this body, on both sides of 
the aisle—and we did get a 67-vote ma-
jority to move forward with this bill: 
Let’s show them that America can 
function again. Let’s get this bill 
passed. Let’s get it over to the House. 
Let’s get it to the President’s desk for 
his signature. 
With that, I yield, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is good 
to see the Senate taking up a genu-
inely bipartisan bill this week. A group 
of Members from both parties have 
spent weeks developing this legisla-
tion, and we saw the result of their 
work in the bipartisan support for pro-
ceeding to this bill. 
Now, we need to let that bipartisan 
process continue. We need to give 
Members who weren’t a part of the bi-
partisan group a chance to weigh in, 
and that means making sure that we 
have a robust amendment process. 
I know the majority leader is eager 
to get through this legislation and on 
to the Democrats’ next piece of what is 
partisan legislation, and that is a $31⁄2 
trillion tax-and-spending spree, but

that is not a good reason for rushing 
this infrastructure bill through the 
Senate. 
This is an enormous bill. It is more 
than 2,700 pages long, and the legisla-
tive text was just released last night. 
To start with, Members need time to 
digest this legislation, and then Mem-
bers need the opportunity to offer 
amendments. 
The bill before us today is a genu-
inely bipartisan bill, and I am very 
grateful for the tireless efforts of the 
Members who put in so many long days 
and nights—and weekends, I might 
add—to get us to this point. 
Like a lot of our colleagues, I spent 
the weekend here in Washington as the 
bipartisan group worked through many 
final drafting issues, and I appreciate 
the fact that the members of the group 
took the time to get the bill as right as 
possible before introducing it. 
But this legislation was still put to-
gether by only a handful of Senators. 
And unlike traditional highway bills, 
there are major pieces of this legisla-
tion that haven’t been through the 
rigor of a committee process. 
So all Members deserve the chance to 
weigh in. A number of Senators have 
raised legitimate concerns about this 
legislation, such as whether the pro-
posed pay-fors are sufficient to keep 
this legislation from driving up our 
debt, and they deserve to have the 
chance to air those concerns and offer 
possible solutions. 
Infrastructure legislation is some of 
the most essential legislation that we 
consider. Commerce in this country de-
pends on the strength of our infrastruc-
ture, from up-to-date electric grids to 
well-maintained 
airports 
and 
train 
tracks, ports and waterways, and roads 
and bridges. 
We need to get this legislation right, 
and that means giving Members ample 
time to examine the details of the bill, 
and it means giving Members the 
chance to address any problems in the 
bill through a meaningful amendment 
process. We shouldn’t sacrifice ade-
quate time on this bill merely because 
the Democratic leader would like to 
spend next week jamming a 100-percent 
partisan piece of legislation through 
the U.S. Senate. 
Let’s honor the bipartisan process 
that has gotten us this far by finishing 
this infrastructure bill with a robust, 
bipartisan amendment process. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
TRIBUTE TO CARISSA MOORE 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, last 
week, the world saw something that it 
had never seen before: surfing as an 
Olympic sport. The story of how this 
happened begins with a native Hawai-
ian named Duke Kahanamoku. 
Duke was a natural athlete. He 
learned to swim at Waikiki Beach, and 
he went on to win five Olympic swim-
ming medals, including three golds. He 
was an innovator who pioneered some-
thing called the ‘‘Kahanamoku kick,’’ 
or the flutter kick, now used by most 
freestyle swimmers. 
He was a visionary who, after win-
ning gold at the 1912 Stockholm Olym-
pics, pressed the International Olympic 
Committee to make surfing an Olym-
pic sport. He traveled the world to pro-
mote surfing, bringing it to the conti-
nental United States and Australia and 
elsewhere, and became known as the 
father of modern surfing. 
But, more than anything else, Duke 
Kahanamoku was an ambassador of 
aloha and the spirit of Hawaii. A re-
porter once asked him if it was a bigger 
thrill to win gold medals or ‘‘ride some 
of those giant waves,’’ and he answered 
that surfing was a bigger thrill. 
One century later, Duke’s vision of 
Olympic surfing became reality, and 
there is nothing more fitting than Ha-
waii’s own Carissa Moore winning the 
first Olympic Gold Medal. 
If you want to see what the embodi-
ment of aloha looks like, look no fur-
ther than Carissa Moore. Like Duke, 
she shares his native Hawaiian roots 
and started surfing at Waikiki Beach 
as a young child. By the time she 
reached high school, she was already 
world-class. 
She 
attended 
my 
alma 
mater, 
Punahou, a school that has graduated 
more than 30 Olympians and President 
Obama. Carissa also became the young-
est person ever to win a world surfing 
title, at age 18, and went on to win 
three more. 
Today, she stands alone as the 
world’s top-ranked surfer, but it is not 
just talent that sets her apart. There is 
a saying that the best surfer is the one 
having the most fun, and that is un-
questionably the case with Carissa. She 
is actually the best surfer, and she is 
also having the most fun. 
She has this incredible combination 
of speed and power in the water and a 
remarkable humility that she carries 
with her everywhere that she goes. She 
is an intense competitor who wants to 
win every event that she enters but 
also wants to see her opponents and, 
more importantly, the sport of surfing 
itself succeed. 
She has a passion to be admired and 
a joy that is infectious. She is, in 
short, the rare athlete who must be 
seen to be believed. And I know be-
cause I have seen it in Hawaii, and now 
the whole world knows too. 
After she won the gold medal last 
week, 
Carissa 
spoke 
of 
Duke 
Kahanamoku. ‘‘It was beautiful to see 
his dream come true a century later,’’ 
she said. She might as well have been 
speaking for all of Hawaii. 
So, today, we honor Duke and the in-
credible legacy that he left. We honor 
Carissa Moore for her athleticism and 
her commitment to inspire the next 
generation of surfers, especially young 
girls, and we celebrate the sport of 
surfing finally getting the recognition 
that it deserves. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
am on the floor this afternoon as we 
are waiting to learn when we might be 
able to proceed to a series of amend-
ments as they relate to the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act. 
This is a significant measure, one 
that I have been very proud to be in-
volved with for a period of time, work-
ing with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle in our working groups—G–10, G– 
22—working with the committee chair-
man and ranking member, working 
with other Members to get where we 
are today, which is a long-awaited— 
really, a long-away—investment in our 
Nation’s infrastructure. 
I know that Members are looking 
through the significant legislation that 
is in front of us. You don’t need to take 
my word for it. You can look at the 
number of inches of the document in 
front of me. It is significant. 
Mr. President, I would suggest to you 
the need in this country is significant 
when it comes to investments in our 
Nation’s infrastructure—our core infra-
structure—what we define to be our 
roads, our rails, our bridges, our ports, 
our water and sewer, our broadband. I 
think we recognize that we talk a lot 
in this Chamber and perhaps on the 
other side, as well, and Presidents have 
come and gone and all talked about the 
need for more investment in our infra-
structure. But truth be told, we really 
haven’t done a real wholesale effort to-
ward that goal until this year. We saw 
significant work come out of commit-
tees this year. 
I want to commend the chairman of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, Senator CARPER, my friend 
from Delaware. His committee worked 
hard, not only on the surface transpor-
tation measure but also the water in-
frastructure measure that had passed 
through. 
We have seen other good work in 
other areas of infrastructure. 
I am on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee. That committee 
was able to move out a significant— 
what we call the power infrastruc-
ture—piece that became one of the an-
chor tenets, if you will, within this 
measure. 
There has been good, collaborative 
work through the committees. Then 
that has been built on by Members, 
again, across the aisle over these past 
months to get us to where we are 
today. 
I ask Members, as they are going 
through the bill itself, the language 
that we had hoped we would get a little 
bit 
earlier 
for 
colleagues 
to 
go 
through—but in fairness, we really 
needed to take the time to make sure

August 2, 2021 
that we had gotten it right. It really 
does matter. So it did cause some delay 
that we wish we could have avoided, 
but we are where we are. 
It is Monday afternoon, and what I 
am hearing from colleagues is that 
they want an opportunity to engage in 
this process. Many in this body have 
not been part of the working groups. 
Perhaps, they weren’t part of the com-
mittees that had advanced some of 
these pieces of legislation that we have 
incorporated. They want to be partici-
pants, and rightly so. This is the time 
to do just that. 
I think it is everyone’s intention 
that we have a robust amendment 
process moving forward. I am actually 
looking forward to this. I have had the 
opportunity on this floor several times 
now to be able to manage energy bills, 
natural resources bills, bills that have 
been significant, bills on which we have 
actually been able to have a pretty de-
cent amendment process. 
Sometimes, in fairness—sometimes— 
that amendment process caused things 
to derail for a period of time. We don’t 
want to do that in this instance, not at 
all. But it is not very often that we 
really do have a true and a meaningful 
amendment process. We are going to 
have an opportunity for that with the 
budget resolution coming forward. But 
I think, for the most part, most of us 
know that there is a lot of messaging 
that goes on. This is not about mes-
saging. This is about delivering results 
for the American people. This is about 
creating jobs as we build out legacy in-
frastructure that is needed around the 
country. 
Highways. 
We 
all 
know—we 
all 
know—that our highways are in need of 
help and support. The provisions that 
we have included in this measure for 
roads and bridges will be significant as 
we 
attend 
to 
the 
many 
damaged 
bridges that we see around the country, 
that really do present a threat to pub-
lic safety. Let’s get on them. We know 
our highways, in so many areas, are in 
serious disrepair, and in certain areas, 
we need to be doing more to help build 
out that highway infrastructure to 
ease the congestion to allow for greater 
efficiency, to allow us, as Americans, 
to do more of the things that we want 
to do, whether it is to spend more time 
with your family, be more productive 
at your work, but let’s have an effi-
cient system. 
We have a little over 14,000 miles of 
public roads in Alaska. I can tell you 
that, as we look to my State’s roads 
and the condition and the shape that 
they are in, I know that we need in-
vestments in this space, but I also 
know that it is not just about roads 
and bridges. We also allow for things 
like replacements of culverts for the 
community—actually, the community 
that I was born in—in Ketchikan. I just 
met with the community leaders, and 
they shared with me that some of these 
culvert replacement projects are as 
key and critical to them as anything 
else that they have going on. And so 
recognizing that what we are doing is 
allowing for greater safety, greater ac-
cess through our support for highways, 
for bridges, for things like culverts, for 
pedestrian safety initiatives, I think 
we all want to do more in that area. 
Alaskans probably fly more than we 
drive. Our reality is some 80 percent of 
our communities are not connected by 
road, and the geography, the expanse 
that we deal with, is that we are just 
not going to be connected that way. 
But we don’t need to be connected that 
way when we can be connected by the 
air and when we can be connected over 
the water. And so this legislation is, 
again, very important to those who fly. 
And when I talk about flying, you 
know, sometimes these are small bush 
carriers, moving mail and groceries 
and people to medical appointments. 
But the fact that we have $15 billion in 
formula funding for the FAA Airport 
Improvement Program, this is going to 
be key. This helps with everything 
from runway lighting to navigation, 
taxiway initiatives. These are ways 
that the 400 public airports in Alaska 
are going to be able to move out on a 
more efficient basis, if you will, some 
of the necessary safety upgrades that 
they have in front of them. And, again, 
us, it is not just about the land-based 
airports; we also have the sea-based 
areas that we worry about. We have 
some 114 sea-based airports that we 
refer to. 
So recognizing that not every airport 
is like a Dulles or a DCA here, what we 
are able to do for our small hub air-
ports, our nonhub airports, our nonpri-
mary 
airports—communities 
of 
all 
sizes, because, again, whether you are 
in Bethel or Utqiagvik or wherever you 
may be throughout the State, all sizes 
are not the same here. So making sure 
that we are able to accommodate that 
is going to be important. 
I have mentioned that we are also 
connected on land, air, but also by sea, 
and for those of us who are in coastal 
States—the Senator from Delaware has 
a coastline, has ferries—people move 
around by ferries. We rely on our Alas-
ka Marine Highway System. There are 
some 30, 35 different communities 
where that really is their connector. 
That is how the kids move the high 
school basketball team. That is how 
the church groups move. That is how 
you pick up the groceries at Costco in 
Juneau, and you put them on the ferry 
to go over to Angoon. It is how people 
shop. It is how they—it is their road. It 
is the Alaska Marine Highway System, 
and so recognizing the support that we 
can provide for our ferry systems, 
whether it is in Alaska or Delaware or 
places in between, is, again, an impor-
tant opportunity for us. 
We recognize that as we provide sup-
port for those technologies that will 
allow us to move people more effi-
ciently and more cleanly, there is a lot 
of emphasis from this administration, 
particularly, with focus on EVs. Well, 
in this measure, we not only have pro-
visions 
as 
they 
relate 
to 
clean 
schoolbuses but also to alternative fuel 
ferries. Recognizing that we have some 
opportunities, whether it is an EV 
ferry that might run from Haines to 
Skagway or an alternative fuel, we 
want to be thinking forward into the 
future. 
One of the pieces of this measure— 
this very significant infrastructure 
bill—that a lot of work has gone into is 
the water and wastewater title. This is 
significant. This is significant. We saw, 
not too many years ago, the situation 
in Flint, MI, with lead pipes. We have 
been working to address many of those 
issues for a period of time, and rightly 
so. We provide significant funding— 
more than $180 million over 5 years— 
for the water and wastewater projects 
in Alaska through the Clean Water 
State Revolving Fund and the Drink-
ing Water State Revolving Fund pro-
grams. These are significant for us. 
In so many parts of the State, we are 
either faced with unserved commu-
nities, when it comes to water and 
wastewater, or vastly underserved. And 
when I say unserved, we kind of know 
what it means in the broadband sense, 
but let me explain to you what it 
means in the water and sewer place. It 
means that you don’t have running 
water in your home; you don’t have a 
toilet that flushes. You have a commu-
nity well where people go, and they fill 
up their cherry jugs and haul it back. 
It means that for sanitation, for using 
the bathroom, the bathroom is effec-
tively a Home Depot bucket. If you are 
fancy, you have a toilet seat on it. But 
it is the responsibility of somebody in 
the family to haul that bucket out and 
dump it. 
I have shared pictures on the floor 
here of what that really means in a 
community 
to 
have 
no 
water—no 
water, no sewer system. Thirty-two out 
of a hundred ninety rural Alaska vil-
lages are currently in this situation. 
I received a voice mail, over the 
weekend, from one of Alaska’s mayors 
from a smaller community—on the 
road system, though. And she shared 
with me—and I owe her a call back— 
but she shared with me—she said: You 
know, there are so many people in my 
community who don’t have running 
water. And, again, this is a community 
that is on the road system between An-
chorage and Fairbanks. And so how we 
can help address what most would say 
is pretty basic infrastructure, is pretty 
basic healthcare needs when it comes 
to water and sanitation, there is sig-
nificant funding in this measure for In-
dian Health Service’s sanitation facili-
ties. 
I am the ranking member on the In-
dian Affairs Committee. I have been on 
this committee since I came to the 
Senate 19 years ago. I have seen, over 
the years, the efforts that we have 
made to try to address the water and 
sanitation needs in Indian Country in 
Alaska with our Native villages. Our 
reality that we face is we are still in an 
extreme deficit when it comes to our 
Tribal communities. The reality is that

August 2, 2021 
we have left them behind when it 
comes to something like modern-day 
water and the wastewater systems. And 
so the unprecedented investment in 
sanitation infrastructure is one that, I 
think, is significant and incredibly im-
portant because we are seeking to clear 
all the known project needs. 
Now, people will say that is aggres-
sive, but let me tell you, when you go 
to some of these communities and you 
hear the concerns from the people in 
the village about how they are sup-
posed to keep their families from con-
tracting this virus, when this first sim-
ple step is to wash your hands, and 
they say: Water is pretty precious 
around here because we don’t have a 
sink to wash our hands in. And so the 
effort here to catch up—and I don’t 
even like to use those words in that 
sense. We have to do right by our Na-
tive people, and the effort here, I 
think, is key and critically important. 
Another area that I am pleased that 
working with the committee of juris-
diction, led by Senator CARPER, that 
there has been a focus on—and this is 
something that Ranking Member CAP-
ITO
has been keenly focused on, as 
well—and this is the PFOS contamina-
tion through our clean water and our 
drinking water programs. 
I also recognize that there is a focus 
on small and disadvantaged commu-
nities. I have one small community 
down in southeast Alaska, Gustavus. It 
is the community that is right next to 
the Glacier Bay National Monument 
area, and the PFOS in their little com-
munity, near the airport area, is some-
thing that is a major and significant 
concern for that tiny, small, little 
community. So making sure that, 
again, these programs—the funding 
that we are helping to advance—is 
good, whether you are an urban area 
with 100-year-old pipes that need re-
placement or you are a community 
that has lacked the original infrastruc-
ture in the first place, how we are able 
to ensure that the needs of our small 
communities are met as well is signifi-
cant, and I think it is an important 
part of this legislation. 
I mentioned broadband as being that 
other connector. We connect by way of 
transportation systems. We get that. 
But, nowadays, if you are not con-
nected—if you are not connected by the 
broadband availability, the ability to 
communicate elsewhere—your econo-
mies are limited; you are limited. I 
mentioned the fact that so many of the 
communities in my State are not con-
nected by a road and probably will not 
be in my lifetime. And they are not 
seeking that as an answer, but they do 
want to be connected to the rest of the 
world. They want to know that for the 
crafts that they are able to make at 
home, they have the ability to, per-
haps, sell them to a broader audience. 
Maybe it is on your own little website, 
selling to folks in the lower 48 or glob-
ally. But you can’t do that. You can’t 
do that if you don’t have the connec-
tion. 
And so the recognition that the 
grants 
for 
the 
deployment—the 
broadband deployment—with minimum 
allocation to each State are important, 
but also recognizing a focus on these 
high-cost areas for deployment. I am 
just saying, if you are looking for a 
high-cost area for deployment, look no 
further than Alaska. It is not some-
thing that we are proud of; it is a re-
ality. But part of the tragedy that we 
see is that, in many communities, 
broadband has arrived. The internet is 
there, but people can’t afford to use it. 
We have heard in the height of the 
pandemic last year a reality that fami-
lies could not—could not connect be-
cause the cost to do so was just prohib-
itive, 
which 
meant 
that 
children 
weren’t gaining that full access to the 
information. It meant that if you were 
trying to work from home, that you 
couldn’t do that. And so it is a reality 
that it is not just about access, but ac-
cess has to mean some level of afford-
ability. 
So the focus in this broadband piece, 
I think, is critically important as we 
look to the provisions in the Middle 
Mile Infrastructure grants; as we look 
to 
the 
support, 
again, 
for 
Tribal 
broadband, recognizing, again, that 
this is an area that has been chron-
ically underfunded in the past. 
There is so much that—when you 
think about how solid infrastructure 
allows you to have an economy. In An-
chorage, we host what we call Alaska’s 
port. And it is a significant port. Obvi-
ously the largest one in the State. But 
it is through the Port of Alaska that 
over 85 percent of the goods, the com-
modities come into the State, and then 
they are distributed either by truck or 
by rail, air, but they are moved out 
from there. And we know what an eco-
nomic driver that port is to not only 
Anchorage, but to the State as well. 
But it is not just big ports; it is also 
the smaller ports. We have got more 
coastline than any State in the coun-
try. 
And, again, if you don’t have the 
roads, how are you getting in? 
You are maybe flying in by small air-
plane, but more likely your materials 
are barged up during the summer 
months. That is how you get the lum-
ber. That is how you get the snow ma-
chine or the four-wheeler to go out and 
do your hunting. 
Our reality is that our ports have to 
work in every size community, and so 
knowing that there will be additional 
support for remote and subsistence 
harbor construction is going to be so 
key—so key—to these small, small, lit-
tle communities for whom, if they 
didn’t have this, they have got noth-
ing. 
You can’t move fish out, you can’t 
move fish in; you can’t move goods in, 
you can’t move goods out. Everything, 
then, is flown in; and think about what 
that means if everything is flown in. It 
is crazy, wicked expensive. And you are 
talking about a—you are talking about 
a sheet of sheetrock, the fact is that if 
you are—if you are flying in your ma-
terials, it is almost impossible to be 
able to afford any of it. 
There is so much, again, when I 
think about ways that we help to build 
our communities, help build our econo-
mies, help create jobs through infra-
structure. 
And I spent a lot of time focused on 
energy initiatives, and I am pleased 
with the work that came out of the En-
ergy Committee that is focused in 
these various areas that drive the level 
of innovation that we will need as we 
are working to be more efficient, to 
have cleaner energy sources, and to 
really be more competitive. 
We effectively took the Energy Act 
that we passed last—at the end of last 
Congress and we helped to build out 
many of the provisions that were con-
tained in that act, whether it is the ad-
vanced reactor demonstration project; 
more on hydropower and marine en-
ergy research; funding for geothermal, 
wind, solar energy; the energy storage 
demonstration 
projects—so 
much, 
again, that is focused on what do we 
need to do to really be not only for-
ward-leaning and innovative, but effi-
cient to allow for a more competitive 
role globally. 
When you think about our Nation’s 
grid infrastructure and resiliency, you 
don’t need to close your eyes and imag-
ine what can happen when your grid 
fails. 
Unfortunately, as we are seeing—as 
we 
are 
seeing, 
whether 
they 
are 
wildfires, whether we are seeing brown-
outs with the extreme heat, our reality 
is that our grid infrastructure needs 
support. We need to have that resil-
iency that we all talk about. And, 
again, I am going to stand up for the 
small grids, the smaller utilities who 
face the same pressures that you might 
have in an integrated grid back here, in 
fact, even maybe more so. 
If you are a small, stand-alone com-
munity, you are your own grid. You 
need to have a level of resilience and 
the ability to make sure that people 
are not literally freezing in the dark. 
And so the effort that we have in-
cluded with regards to our set-aside for 
small utilities, these are—these are 
significant initiatives. 
I have mentioned resilience a couple 
different times. I think sometimes peo-
ple think that that is a word that is 
overused, but I will tell you, we can’t 
be doing enough when it comes to resil-
ience. 
We have included in this measure a 
provision that we entitled ‘‘Tribal Cli-
mate Resilience.’’ This is funding that 
is included to really help with those 
threatened communities. Many we see 
in my State, but certainly I hear from 
colleagues in other States who are see-
ing the same concerns as communities 
are more threatened due to—whether it 
is erosion, as we are seeing in Alaska, 
or flooding, but support to assist with 
climate resilience, adaptation projects, 
as well as community relocation. 
I will wrap up by just a little bit 
more commentary on the resilience

piece. We are seeing in the West incred-
ible drought right now. We are seeing 
the extent of these forest fires from Or-
egon going east. But I think it is im-
portant for colleagues to know that, 
again, when we are taking about infra-
structure and resilience, we also are 
acknowledging 
natural 
resource-re-
lated infrastructure and what more we 
might be doing with wildfire manage-
ment, ecosystem restoration. 
And so to make sure that there is 
support for things like mechanical 
thinning, fuel breaks, other activities 
to reduce the risk of wildfire, whether 
it is on our Forest Service lands or any 
of our public lands, but also the con-
cerns, then, when the fire knows no 
boundary as to whose lands they are. 
Certainly in Alaska we saw the ben-
efit of fuel breaks as they were imple-
mented on the Kenai. We had a pretty 
significant fire several years back, the 
Funny River Fire, and we saw full well 
what that fuel break really did to help 
protect property and life. 
The bill also includes precommercial 
thinning, which, again, is important in 
a host of different areas, not the least 
of which in my State on the Tongass. 
But I think we do a good job to make 
sure that when we are talking about 
infrastructure, we are recognizing the 
core infrastructure of—whether it is 
legacy 
projects, 
like 
roads, 
rails, 
bridges, but also recognizing that in-
frastructure has impact to our lands 
and how we ensure that there is greater 
resilience, again, greater protections, 
and ensuring that it is addressed per-
haps more broadly. 
So there is much good in this bill. 
There is not everything that I would 
have wanted, most certainly. There are 
a lot of things in it that, in fairness, I 
wish weren’t in it. There are some 
pieces that I look at and I say ‘‘way 
over the top,’’ but I have to acknowl-
edge I come from a State where infra-
structure is just a little bit different. 
We don’t have a big public transit 
system, so I look at the transit dollars, 
and my immediate jump is: Way too 
much. Don’t need this. 
But I recognize that in a collabo-
rative process, in a negotiated process, 
you have got to hear the views back 
and forth of all of your colleagues, and 
you take some things and you leave 
some things behind in a give-and-take 
process. 
And so just as my colleagues have 
listened to me convey the urgency of 
need for more support for the Tribal 
programs when it comes to infrastruc-
ture, whether it is on water and sanita-
tion or broadband, they heard the ur-
gency there; whether it was recog-
nizing 
that 
not 
all 
infrastructure 
projects are big in terms of their size, 
but they are big for that small commu-
nity; to know that the fishing commu-
nity of Craig is going to be able to 
build out that little harbor there. 
And so I have asked my colleagues to 
listen to the concerns of a very rural 
State like Alaska, a State where our 
infrastructure is very unique, and they 
have had an open mind and a view to-
wards not only recognizing how unique 
Alaska is, but recognizing the unique 
needs of rural America. 
So we have a compromise product in 
front of us, and it is a significant prod-
uct, and we are now at a place where 
we want colleagues to join us in this 
product, weigh in with your good ideas. 
Let’s move some good amendments. 
But I would suggest that the sooner we 
start moving with these amendments, 
the better it will be for us and this 
process here, but also for the American 
public. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while 
the Senator from Alaska is still here, I 
have been sitting here listening to a 
tour de force. God, what a wonderful, 
wonderful speech and clearly from the 
heart. 
The Presiding Officer and I are recov-
ering Governors, and the Senator’s fa-
ther was a recovering Governor at one 
time; and, actually, one of the smart-
est things he ever did, he appointed his 
daughter to serve—when there was a 
vacancy in the Senate, he appointed 
Lisa to serve at that vacancy. 
And 2 years later, Tony Mills, who 
was Governor of Alaska, ran against 
her. Tony is one of my closest friends. 
We were Governors together for 6 
years, and I said: Oh, my God, this is a 
hard choice. 
And it was a hard choice for the folks 
from Alaska to make as well. 
And Lisa was elected to the Senate 
and served with distinction. And when 
she ran for reelection as a Republican, 
I think, was defeated in a primary, and 
then turned around and ran a write-in 
campaign that I will never forget. I am 
sure she won’t either. 
And in a write-in campaign, in one of 
the cleverest political maneuvers I 
have ever seen—MURKOWSKI is not an 
easy name to write in. Not everybody 
in Alaska, even though a famous name, 
knew how to write ‘‘Murkowski.’’ 
My recollection is the Murkowski 
campaign folks were smart enough to 
distribute fliers and messages through-
out the State that had a picture of—a 
drawing—a cartoon of a cow on skis, 
with a bubble coming out of the cow’s 
mouth with the word ‘‘Mur’’—‘‘Mur 
cow ski.’’ Then she won, rather hand-
ily, her write-in race and still is with 
us today. 
We talked a lot here today about 
bridges. When I was in college, I was 
actually a Navy midshipman, and I was 
driving down to Florida to visit my 
parents and close friend, and we drove 
across a bridge across the Ohio River. I 
want to say—actually, I think the date 
was 1967. December 15, 1967, we were on 
our way to my parents in Florida, and 
the next day the bridge that we had 
gone across collapsed into the Ohio 
River between Point Pleasant, WV, and 
Conagua, OH, and 46 people were killed. 
Forty-six people were killed. I will 
never forget that. Whenever we talk 
about the need to address our poor con-
dition bridges, I remember that. And 
for the folks who had lost loved ones 
that day, they remember that too. 
We have gone through some troubled 
waters here in the Capitol and the Sen-
ate and in the House and in our coun-
try in recent months, weeks, years, and 
there is still trouble. And it is great to 
have a bridge over troubled waters, 
like you, to carry us through. And I 
just want to thank you for your great 
work in so many different ways but 
also with respect to the gang of 22 and 
keeping people on track. You make 
your family proud, and I think all of us 
proud, so thank you. Thank you. 
I have been joined by a fellow from 
Louisiana, and I understand we are 
also going to be joined shortly by the 
fellow from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, 
who is going to come to the floor any 
minute, I think, to give his remarks. 
And I don’t know if the gentleman 
from Louisiana is here to speak shortly 
or not, but we look forward to what-
ever he has to say. 
We are now joined by the Senator 
from Ohio, successor to George Voino-
vich, who was both a Senator and a 
Governor. I had a great conversation 
with him in Ohio last week, and I am 
very grateful to him for his extraor-
dinary leadership through these trou-
bled waters, and there will be another 
one of those bridges over troubled 
waters. 
I am happy to yield the floor to Sen-
ator PORTMAN. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Chairman CARPER, 
thank you. Thank you for managing 
this important legislation and all the 
work you have put into it. 
You know, I asked my team today: 
Can you give me a sense of how much 
of this underlying legislation we are 
talking about on the floor this week 
that was already written? In other 
words, what did Senator CAPITO, Sen-
ator CARPER, and others on the EPW 
Committee, as an example, already 
write with regard to this surface trans-
portation bill that we are simply pick-
ing up in this legislation and moving 
forward to be sure it gets reauthorized, 
certainly before September 30, and we 
hope far before that. And about half of 
the pages of the bill is language that 
was written through the committee 
process here. Now, some may be happy 
to hear that, and some may be unhappy 
to hear that, but that is the truth. 
And, frankly, it made our job easier be-
cause a lot of the hard work was done. 
In the case of the legislation that 
Senators CARPER
and CAPITO
shep-
herded through their committee with 
regard to our highways and bridges, it 
was a 20-to-nothing vote, as I recall, 
out of committee, unanimous. So we 
thought it was appropriate for us not 
to tell them how to do their job but to 
help them by picking up that legisla-
tion, and as they have improved that 
legislation, their underlying authoriza-
tion legislation, and ensure that it is

included in the package. And I appre-
ciate Senator CARPER and Senator CAP-
ITO working with us on that even over 
the past few weeks. So, yes, we have 
added more on top of it because we be-
lieve our Nation needs a shot in the 
arm. We have enormous infrastructure 
needs. But without Senator CAPITO and 
Senator CARPER’s involvement, 20 to 
nothing out of committee, we wouldn’t 
be where we are today, and that is the 
foundation upon which this was built. 
So, again, I know that is not under-
stood by everybody, but that is a fact. 
And our Nation’s infrastructure does 
need the help. And this legislation, the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act before us right now, is an unprece-
dented investment. It is historic, but it 
is that because a historic investment is 
needed. It is important to note that we 
did so without raising taxes on the 
American people or causing further in-
flation in an already overheated econ-
omy. I heard some of my colleagues on 
my side say: Gosh, I want to support 
you, but I am worried about the spend-
ing and its impact on inflation. Well, 
this is what the economists would call 
supply-side spending. This is long-term 
spending for capital assets that may 
last 40, 50, 70 years. Think of a bridge 
or think of another infrastructure 
project like a big water infrastructure 
project. So it is a different kind of 
spending. It is not going to be spent 
over the next year. In fact, very little, 
if any, will be spent in the next year, 
but it will be spent over time—over 5, 
10 years for these kinds of projects. 
That is the kind of money that goes 
into building infrastructure and build-
ing jobs. Therefore, again, on the sup-
ply side rather than the demand side of 
the economy, as economists would say, 
it is not stimulating the economy in 
that way; it is growing the economy 
long term. 
Most economists who have looked at 
this, including economists like Doug 
Holtz-Eakin, who used to be here at 
CBO, or an economist like Michael 
Strain at the American Enterprise In-
stitute or the Penn work-study at the 
University of Pennsylvania. They all 
say the same thing, which is that this 
is actually counterinflationary kind of 
spending. That is important. 
I will say that this is needed because 
we are falling behind as a country, and 
every State has its own needs here. I 
will tell you what my needs are in the 
State of Ohio, which is that we make a 
lot of stuff. So our factory workers who 
make tanks and cars and washing ma-
chines, we want to be sure that our in-
frastructure works to be able to get 
that to market. Sometimes that mar-
ket is the United States, and some-
times it is overseas. Therefore, our 
ports are important but so is our rail 
and so are our highways. Our farmers— 
we have got a lot of farmers in Ohio 
who plant crops. We want to make sure 
that those crops can get to the ele-
vators so that the grain can get out. 
We have a lot of people in Ohio who 
live in cities and commute. And so the 
mom who is looking at her commute 
every day and saying, ‘‘Why do I get 
stuck in traffic at rush hour both ways 
and have to spend all this time in the 
car when I could be spending it with 
my kids,’’ wouldn’t it be great to im-
prove those highways and those bridges 
to be able to reduce the amount of time 
that someone is stuck in a car? So this 
is about helping our country at a time 
when we need it. 
There is probably no better example 
of that than broadband because think 
about the child in Appalachian Ohio 
who has no Wi-Fi service—like none. I 
am not talking about slow Wi-Fi; I am 
talking about no Wi-Fi. I look at my 
colleague 
from 
West 
Virginia 
and 
think of all the counties in West Vir-
ginia that are in the same shape that 
they are in Eastern Ohio. We are ex-
panding broadband in an unprecedented 
way. The deployment of broadband into 
the rural community but also access in 
the more suburban and urban commu-
nities, that is really important because 
that child now can be able to do the 
schoolwork at home. And during the 
pandemic, of course, this has been a 
huge issue, but it is an issue every day. 
Rather than having to drive with her 
mom to the local library, which some 
girl might have to do in Appalachia to 
find a Wi-Fi signal, she can actually 
get it at home because of this deploy-
ment we have provided here, which is 
unprecedented. 
So all of this is in this. It is all part 
of it. It is important. 
The American Society of Civil Engi-
neers has given our Nation a report 
card every year. Our report card right 
now is a C-minus. We get a C-minus. 
Now, I did get a couple C’s in high 
school and college, so I don’t think C’s 
are always terrible, but I don’t want 
our infrastructure to get a C, much less 
a C-minus. 
They estimate that somewhere in 
America there is a water break every 2 
minutes. Water infrastructure is part 
of this. They also estimate that 43 per-
cent of our public roads are in poor or 
mediocre condition. This hasn’t im-
proved in years. 
We are now listed 13th in the world 
for infrastructure in the most recent 
rankings 
by 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum. They, every year, look at all 
these countries around the world and 
say, where do you rank? The United 
States is right up there. I think Singa-
pore and the United States are some of 
the most competitive countries in the 
world, in terms of all the analysis they 
do, but not on infrastructure. On infra-
structure, it drags us down because, 
frankly, we haven’t invested as other 
countries have. 
The number out there that people use 
is that China spends four times more 
than we do as a percent of their econ-
omy on infrastructure. I think it is ac-
tually higher than that from the num-
bers I have seen. But let’s say it is four 
times more. China gets it. They know 
infrastructure is important for eco-
nomic growth. I talked earlier about 
how it makes the economy more effi-
cient and therefore more productive 
and therefore you have more tax rev-
enue generated. They get that. We have 
allowed our infrastructure to get to the 
point where we are not competitive as 
a country with so many others, not 
just developed countries either. 
We have cut back funding over the 
years, and so it is probably no wonder 
this has happened. The Aspen Eco-
nomic Strategy Group calculated that 
as of 2017, our total spending on infra-
structure across the public and private 
sectors hit its lowest point since at 
least 1947. So relatively speaking, we 
have less expenditures on infrastruc-
ture, and this lack of investment has 
real impact. Historian Henry Petroski 
estimates that the delays caused by 
traffic congestion alone cost our econ-
omy more than $120 billion every year. 
So I talked about the mom who is 
commuting and not being able to spend 
more time with her kids because she is 
sitting in her car—$120 billion a year is 
the economic impact. That is impor-
tant, too. One 2017 study by the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers esti-
mated there was a total infrastructure 
gap of more than $2 trillion that we 
need to address by 2025; otherwise, we 
could lose nearly $4 trillion in GDP, 
economic growth, that we otherwise 
would have produced as a country. 
Now, those are big numbers. Those 
are big numbers. These are the engi-
neers who say we have a gap of $2 tril-
lion we need to address by 2025. Ours is 
$550 billion over the next 5 years—his-
toric levels. Some would say it may 
not be enough. I think it is. And you 
will hear a lot about this, this week, 
all the different places where the infra-
structure investments are made. But 
others would say we need to do even 
more. You can see that there is a need 
for renewed infrastructure. 
Let me give you a really specific ex-
ample, and it is one reason I am inter-
ested in this project, honestly. For, 
gosh, 25 years now, we have been talk-
ing about fixing our bridge in Cin-
cinnati, OH. It is called the Brent 
Spence Bridge. It is where I–75 and I–71 
come together, so think about all the 
commercial traffic. Actually, 3 percent 
of the Nation’s commerce goes over 
this one bridge every year. It is a huge 
economic issue for us in Greater Cin-
cinnati. There is congestion there 
every day. It is a bottleneck. The 
bridge is busy. In fact, it is carrying 
twice the number of cars that it was 
built to carry already. 
There are no shoulders anymore on it 
because they tried to expand the lanes 
as much as they can. We recently had 
two trucks crash there partly because 
there is no shoulder, and the safety 
problems are huge on that bridge. It 
took the bridge out for a couple 
months—a huge economic impact, huge 
economic impact. This bridge, again, 
for 25 years, people have said: We have 
got to replace this bridge. It is not 
safe. It is not big enough. It doesn’t 
connect 71 and 75 in the way that it

should for our commercial activities. It 
is a bridge that has been deemed by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation as 
‘‘functionally obsolete.’’ That sounds 
pretty dramatic—‘‘functionally obso-
lete.’’ Unfortunately, again, these acci-
dents continue to happen because it is 
not safe. You have got 160,000 vehicles 
on it rather than the 80,000 per day it 
was designed to accommodate. It needs 
to be fixed, but it is really expensive, 
and the local community and the State 
just simply can’t do it alone. 
There are critical pieces of infra-
structure like the Brent Spence Bridge 
in States all over our country, from 
roads 
to 
railroads, 
to 
ports, 
to 
broadband networks that all need up-
grades to stay competitive in this glob-
al economy. It is no surprise, then, 
that infrastructure is an area where 
the American people really do want ac-
tion. They get it on this one. They 
want us to come together as Repub-
licans and Democrats and fix this prob-
lem. 
There was a recent poll by CNBC say-
ing 87 percent of Americans think it is 
important we invest in improving our 
crumbling roads and bridges. There was 
another poll that came out a couple 
months later, a very recent poll, say-
ing—again, this is a CBS poll—87 per-
cent of Americans support more Fed-
eral spending on repairing roads and 
bridges. Two polls, 2 months apart, 
same number, 87 percent. Eighty-seven 
percent of the American people don’t 
agree on anything, but they do agree 
on this, which is let’s fix our infra-
structure. Let’s do what Presidents in 
modern times have all said we ought to 
do: President Bush, President Obama, 
President 
Trump, 
President 
Biden. 
President Trump had a proposal for $1.5 
trillion. Ours is $550 billion. President 
Trump is a developer, a builder, and he 
understood the need for infrastructure 
investment, 
but, 
frankly, 
Congress 
didn’t work with him to get that done. 
There were also issues about how that 
was to be paid for. But I commend 
President Trump for raising that issue. 
He ought to be given some credit be-
cause we might not be talking about it. 
At the end, he continued to say we 
need to invest big time in infrastruc-
ture. 
Then President Biden, in his cam-
paign, said the same thing, and when 
he took office, he said the same thing: 
We need to do an infrastructure plan. 
His original plan wasn’t one that Re-
publicans could support because it had 
huge tax increases in it and it had a lot 
of infrastructure that wasn’t core in-
frastructure. That is why we came to-
gether as a bipartisan group. 
Senator CAPITO is here. She worked 
with the White House on this to try to 
come up with a way to move forward, 
and, again, that helped create the foun-
dation for what we have done here. 
But the point is, Republicans and 
Democrats alike over the years have 
said the same thing, which is, it is 
time; let’s fix this infrastructure. 
Finally, we are giving infrastructure 
the help it needs and deserves and giv-
ing the American people, more impor-
tantly, the infrastructure that they 
want. And it is a good investment. One 
2014 University of Maryland study 
found that each dollar spent on infra-
structure can generate a return of as 
much as $3 to the U.S. economy—$1 in, 
$3 out. It is smart spending if done cor-
rectly. That explains again why Presi-
dent Trump put forward the $1.5 tril-
lion package, why President Biden put 
together a package, and why Demo-
crats and Republicans alike up here on 
Capitol Hill talked about infrastruc-
ture for years. 
American workers need infrastruc-
ture. They don’t need new taxes. That 
is why, in this proposal, again, we say: 
Let’s take the taxes out. Let’s pull the 
core infrastructure out so it is more fo-
cused on what is really needed, and 
let’s do it on a bipartisan basis. That is 
what we do in this proposal. 
The pro-growth policies put in place 
by Congress through the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act of 2017 was very good for our 
economy in every respect. Wages went 
up, lowest poverty rate since we start-
ed keeping track of it back in the 1950s. 
It had a lot of very good things. Unem-
ployment was at historic lows for 
many groups, including Blacks and 
Hispanics. It was an overall 15-year low 
in unemployment. 
We have to be sure that we are not 
raising taxes now because we went into 
this pandemic with a strong economy, 
and we have to come out of it with a 
strong economy. But infrastructure is 
something that we should do without 
raising taxes. 
There was a lot of discussion, after 
President Biden talked about infra-
structure, as to whether it could be 
partisan or bipartisan. There were 
some people saying: Let’s put it in 
what is call reconciliation, where you 
don’t need a single Republican vote. I 
applaud President Biden and Repub-
licans and Democrats in this Chamber 
for saying: You know what, this is one 
where we ought to be able to get to-
gether. If you can’t get together on a 
bipartisan 
basis 
on 
infrastructure, 
where can you? 
That is why we were able to figure 
out a way—again, without raising 
taxes and focusing on core infrastruc-
ture—to ensure that the critical infra-
structure we rely on every day—our 
roads, our bridges, our railways, our 
electrical grids, our water supplies, our 
broadband and more—will get fixed. 
Again, 87 percent of the American peo-
ple are looking for us to do that. It is 
no wonder. Go home and talk to the 
people you represent in your State, and 
they will tell you this is one where we 
can come together. We need to deal 
with the infrastructure challenges we 
face and the digital divide that is out 
there. 
What this does not include is a grab 
bag of social spending priorities that 
the Democrats want to include in the 
other bill they are talking about, 
which is the $3.5 trillion spending pro-
posal they unveiled earlier this month, 
and that is an important point my col-
leagues should not miss. 
The President has said that the $3.5 
trillion package, the so-called rec-
onciliation package, will not include 
more core infrastructure funding. In 
other words, the President has said: I 
propose $2.65 trillion. The bipartisan 
group pulled out core infrastructure 
and said it is going to be $550 billion. I 
am now not going to put the additional 
amount I wanted into reconciliation. 
Simply put, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, coming together to focus 
on the core part of this, without taxes, 
have ensured that the ‘‘lot more’’ is 
not going to be spent both on core in-
frastructure and on so-called social in-
frastructure with huge tax increases in 
another package. So this is the best 
thing for the American economy by 
far, to have a bipartisan proposal. 
The President has said that we are 
not going to double-dip. In other words, 
infrastructure won’t be in the next 
package. He said that privately, he said 
that publicly, and I believe he will 
keep his word on that. Certainly, those 
of us who were involved in this will en-
sure that that is not part of the agree-
ment that is violated. 
So we are seeing these studies come 
out that show that this is the right ap-
proach for the economy. We talked 
about the University of Pennsylvania 
Wharton School of business proposal 
that says our proposal will actually in-
crease the economy, raise wages for 
workers, and actually lower our na-
tional debt over the longer term. 
Again, because of this feedback loop we 
talked about earlier, it makes the 
economy more efficient, more produc-
tive, grows the economy, and more rev-
enue will be coming into the economy, 
and, again, we do so without raising 
taxes. 
A Democratic economist, Larry Sum-
mers, and many on the Republican side 
of the aisle have been warning for 
months about inflation. Again, as I 
said 
earlier, 
this 
is 
counterinfla-
tionary. 
The bottom line is that the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act will 
provide a historic investment in hard 
infrastructure, with input from a bi-
partisan 
group 
of 
Senators, 
while 
avoiding the tax hikes and the reckless 
spending proposed by the Biden admin-
istration. 
Importantly, for the sake of future 
bipartisan hearings here in Congress, 
this is an infrastructure plan that al-
lows us to avoid the repeat of the 
COVID–19 $1.9 trillion spending bill 
that passed under the partisan process 
called reconciliation. It demonstrates 
to the American people that, in fact, 
we can figure out how to work together 
to get big things done. President Biden 
said he wanted to work in a bipartisan 
way. Well, this is a great example of it. 
It is a genuine effort on behalf of Re-
publicans and Democrats to find com-
mon ground and move our country for-
ward. 
I am committed to working with my 
colleagues here in the Senate to see

this legislation through to the end. We 
have come a long way, and I believe we 
are close to achieving a historic vic-
tory for the American people. I encour-
age all of my colleagues to join us in 
supporting this Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act so that we can truly 
make an important bipartisan invest-
ment in the next generations of Ameri-
cans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I am really on the record oppos-
ing 
President 
Biden’s 
decision 
to 
abruptly withdraw troops from Afghan-
istan, and I oppose it for the same rea-
sons many of the world’s most re-
spected military officials oppose it. 
We knew our allies would suffer. The 
Taliban have burned their way through 
Afghanistan and staked a claim on 
much of the territory that we have now 
abandoned. We created a void, and the 
Taliban walked right on in. 
Last week, we watched as another of 
our adversaries planted their own flag 
in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
tweeted this picture from a meeting be-
tween Chinese Communist Party offi-
cials and the Taliban. That is correct, 
Wednesday of last week. They even 
went so far as to say they are hopeful 
that the Taliban will embrace a peace-
ful and more inclusive approach to gov-
ernment. 
It was a nice piece of performance art 
from a government recently accused of 
genocide. But this is what the CCP 
does best—fill the void, throw up a dip-
lomatic facade, and seize as much 
power as they possibly can seize as 
quickly as they can do it. 
Back home in Tennessee, we have felt 
the ripple effects of Beijing’s creeping 
dominance. You know, when most peo-
ple think of a foreign threat, they 
think of an army or a spy ring, but 
what we need to understand is that 
these threats are much more subtle. If 
you don’t know what you are looking 
for, you will end up missing it. 
Back in the midnineties, when I was 
the executive director for the Ten-
nessee Film, Entertainment and Music 
Commission, we were already fighting 
a losing battle against Chinese intel-
lectual property theft. Now, this might 
not seem like a matter of national se-
curity, but for the songwriters and pro-
ducers and creators who fell victim to 
it, it was a matter of economic secu-
rity. This theft made them vulnerable. 
It made multiple industries vulnerable 
in our State, including the auto indus-
try, auto parts, aviation, water sports. 
They all started to feel the effects of a 
dishonest Chinese Communist Party, 
and therefore, it made our country’s 
economy vulnerable. The same goes for 
those playing whack-a-mole with the 
pirates and counterfeiters selling sto-
len or outright fake merchandise. 
It is a serious vulnerability. Some-
times those vulnerabilities are more 
obvious, however. For example, when 
the novel coronavirus sent us into 
lockdown, we were finally able to draw 
attention to how much control Beijing 
has over healthcare in America. They 
have a stranglehold on our supply 
chains for active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients and medical supplies. 
I introduced the SAM-C Act last year 
with Senator MENENDEZ. That legisla-
tion would protect those supply chains 
and bring production back to the 
United States. This threat didn’t spon-
taneously evolve; it is the result of 100 
seemingly small vulnerabilities that 
our adversaries in Beijing had found a 
way to exploit. How did it happen? 
Well, it has a lot to do with their slow 
takeover of international organiza-
tions—namely, the United Nations. 
Since 1971, the Chinese Communist 
Party has exploited hopes that mem-
bership in the U.N. would force them to 
behave like a normal country, but the 
reality of the situation is that Chinese 
diplomats control 4 out of 15 special-
ized U.N. agencies and many other sub-
sidiary offices. Even more importantly, 
the CCP is flooding the U.N. with lower 
level staff, which means they have 
strength in numbers that we do not 
have. They have seized far too much 
power for comfort. 
Since 2007, Chinese diplomats have 
led the U.N. Department of Economic 
and Social Affairs, which means they 
have also controlled the direction of 
the U.N.’s development programs. 
By 2015, they had gained enough in-
fluence to make development synony-
mous with Belt and Road Initiative 
projects, which, as we all know, are 
debt 
trap 
schemes 
for 
Beijing’s 
leveraging against struggling nations. 
This is a debt trap scheme. 
In 2014, China placed a diplomat at 
the top of the International Tele-
communication Union. Since then, the 
ITU has more or less been Beijing’s 
mouthpiece. They promote Chinese 
companies, Chinese telecom standards, 
and, of course, support Beijing’s at-
tempts to monopolize communications 
infrastructure in countries stuck in 
debt traps. It is all connected. 
Since their admission to the U.N., 
the CCP has practically achieved im-
munity from accountability for human 
rights violations. The NGO China has 
used for years to whitewash their bar-
baric treatment of Tibetans is now a 
U.N.-accredited organization. 
In 2018, when the United States with-
drew from UNESCO, who was waiting 
in the wings to become the largest fi-
nancial contributor to global edu-
cation? You are right. It was China. 
They have used their stranglehold on 
the Department of Economic and So-
cial Affairs to officially silence the 
Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang. They used 
their status as members of the Human 
Rights Council as cover for horrendous 
human rights violations in Tibet, Inner 
Mongolia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and on 
the Mainland. 
In 2019, we confirmed whistleblower 
testimony that revealed the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights sent the names of activists crit-
ical of the Chinese Communist Party 
straight to Beijing. 
And last year, we watched the World 
Health Organization praise Beijing for 
lying to the world about the severity of 
the disease that would eventually 
cause a deadly global pandemic. 
We are in damage control mode. By 
the end of 2021, the U.N. will hold nine 
elections for heads of specialized agen-
cies and five for major funds or pro-
grams. We control exactly none of 
these positions. 
Our task is twofold. First, we must 
fill these voids. We don’t have a choice. 
But we must also inject accountability 
by holding ourselves accountable for 
the integrity of our own relations with 
the U.N. and foreign countries. 
Last week, I introduced the U.N. 
Transparency and Accountability Act, 
which will strengthen America’s influ-
ence as a key U.N. member nation and 
expose the threat adversarial countries 
pose to international organizations. 
My colleague, Congressman MICHAEL 
MCCAUL, from Texas has companion 
legislation ready to go in the House, 
and there is no sane reason why we 
shouldn’t see these bills come up for a 
vote sooner rather than later. 
We are going to find out exactly who 
these bad actors are. We are going to 
flood the U.N. with Americans to stop 
them. And we are going to account for 
every single penny we contribute to 
U.N. projects. And then we are going to 
make the reports on all that spending 
available to the American taxpayer 
who is footing the bill. No more hiding. 
The bottom line is that we can’t win 
this war without brute force. There is 
no weapon that can neatly cut the 
strings Beijing is pulling. Ceding free-
dom has consequences. The ripple ef-
fect created in Geneva and Brussels 
and New York and Washington can and 
will destroy the lives of people half a 
world away. 
As effective as diplomacy can be, we 
are alone in this one. We are respon-
sible for safeguarding our freedom. 
As President Reagan once said, Free-
dom is always one generation away 
from extinction. ‘‘It has to be fought 
for and defended by each generation.’’ 
There is no kicking the can down the 
road. Once it is gone, it is gone. There 
is no better voice for human rights 
than the United States. And if we do 
not speak up, we give every other na-
tion on the planet an excuse to stay si-
lent also. 
No one will come to our rescue if our 
supply chains are compromised. No one 
will come to the rescue of Tennessee 
innovators and companies if their sup-
ply lines are compromised by the Com-
munist Chinese. And no one else is 
going to make sure our children and 
grandchildren don’t fall into one of 
Beijing’s debt traps. 
Perhaps we should keep that in mind 
this week as we take up all 2,700-plus 
pages of the infrastructure package. If 
ever there was a time for restraint,

this is it. The threat is staring us in 
the face, and I fear that my Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
are 
missing 
the 
threat. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, when I go back to my hometown 
of Alabama, I usually ask the people: 
What is the most important to you? 
Every day, what is the most important 
to you? 
And, usually, there is a consensus of 
three things: a good job, schools for 
their kids, and safe neighborhoods for 
their families. That is always what 
they talk about. 
You know, the fulfillment of these 
basic aspirations is a foundation of a 
quality of life, the foundation of the 
American dream. 
In my relatively short time up here, 
I have noticed people in this building 
often lose sight of those three basic 
items. We waste time bickering over 
things that, at the end of the day, don’t 
much matter in the grand scheme of 
things. We engage in bitter partisan 
commentary, all in the hopes of scor-
ing political points. 
Folks back home can’t relate to this 
because they don’t have the luxury to 
waste time on cheap talk. 
We are witnessing a nationwide surge 
in crime as we speak. In the last year, 
homicides have risen upwards of 30 per-
cent—this is unprecedented—and dou-
bled the largest previous increase of 13 
percent since 1968. 
There is always more than one factor 
to 
consider 
when 
analyzing 
crime 
trends, but the effect of some Demo-
crats’ anti-police rhetoric has been per-
fectly clear. Just take a look at what 
is happening across our country as we 
speak. 
For the last year, we have heard 
some Democrats at every level talk 
about wanting to defund the police, 
take money away from them; we have 
too many of them. In many cities they 
control, Democrats succeeded in reduc-
ing policy budgets. They have been 
very successful. They have told police 
to stop doing their jobs, to stop enforc-
ing certain laws. 
I have heard Democrats say that they 
want to replace cops with social work-
ers. You know, while I understand the 
well-intentioned desire to address the 
root cause of crime, instead of just fo-
cusing on the fallout, leaving our po-
lice underfunded and ill-equipped is not 
the solution. 
If someone is attempting to break 
into my house, I am not calling a so-
cial worker to come perform an evalua-
tion and to develop a treatment for the 
assailant. I am not doing that. 
Too often, we have seen elected offi-
cials take the side of radicals burning 
property, 
looting 
small 
businesses, 
over the men and women who wear the 
badge and have sworn to serve and pro-
tect our communities. And now we are 
seeing the consequences all across the 
country. 
As one report notes, in New York 
City, murders have increased 47 per-
cent since 2020. Tickets and routine ar-
rests dropped by 90 percent, but re-
quests for police intervention went up 
by 50 percent. But the police won’t go. 
They are not wanted. 
Murders in Los Angeles this year are 
up 22 percent, and shootings are up 59 
percent. But arrests in Los Angeles 
have dropped 37 percent since 2020, and 
are down even more this year. 
In Chicago, murders were up 33 per-
cent this year. Last weekend alone, 12 
people were killed and 63 more were 
shot—the latest in a string of deadly 
weekends 
this 
summer. 
And 
carjackings in this city have tripled in 
the last year. 
Why would you buy a car in Chicago? 
It is going to get stolen. It makes no 
sense. 
In Minneapolis, where cries to defund 
the police are loudest, murders are up 
69 percent. It turns out that when pro-
testers, activists, mainstream media, 
and elected officials told cops they are 
not wanted, it is not just the officers 
who heard them; criminals also were 
listening. And the American people are 
paying the price. 
Also, the defund rhetoric from the 
left is having a severely negative effect 
on police morale—an ‘‘all-time low,’’ 
some officers say. According to an NBC 
survey of 200 police departments, offi-
cer retirements are up 45 percent and 
resignations are up 18 percent this 
year. 
Why would anybody get up and put a 
uniform on in the morning with a 
badge on their chest and a gun on their 
side and go to work in this climate of 
crime? 
We have to take our hat off to the 
men and women who are actually doing 
this and doing the best job they can. 
Some police chiefs have had enough. 
The Chicago police superintendent said 
their court system continued to release 
the violent criminals in their jails, 
‘‘making us all less safe.’’ 
The District of Columbia Police, 
right here in our hometown, said: ‘‘[We 
cannot continue to] coddle violent 
criminals.’’ 
Amen. But the ugly truth is there is 
a deliberate attempt to coddle these 
violent criminals, and it is bankrolled 
by the most radical fringe in the Demo-
cratic Party. 
District attorneys are the local pub-
lic officials who determine whether and 
how the government will prosecute 
criminals, from petty theft to violent 
crime—district attorneys. There has 
been a big movement to elect ultra- 
radical liberal district attorneys in big 
cities across the country. They have 
succeeded in Philadelphia, San Fran-
cisco, Boston, and just right across the 
river in Fairfax County, VA. 
These rogue prosecutors—and they 
are rogue—are refusing to prosecute all 
sorts of crimes, like theft, disorderly 
conduct, and trespassing. 
Well, what is their job? 
It is to prosecute. But not these pros-
ecutors. This isn’t just opposing the 
men and women who wear the badge. 
These radical leftists are opposing the 
very idea of enforcing the law. The 
prosecutor’s job is to enforce the laws 
that are written, not rewrite the laws 
on the books. But these DAs are choos-
ing to follow the law as they see fit. 
They know better than anybody else, 
ignoring what the people’s representa-
tives have passed. 
In San Francisco, District Attorney 
Chesa Boudin said his office wouldn’t 
prosecute theft under $950. The result 
has been people robbing stores in broad 
daylight. We have all seen it on TV, 
going in the store, just grabbing all 
you can get and not running out the 
door, but walking out the door. If the 
cops are called, they don’t show up. 
They know they are not going to do 
anything about these. 
But probably the worst of all is in 
Boston. Rachael Rollins, elected DA in 
Boston in 2018, released a list of crimes 
that her office would, by default, move 
to dismiss when they came to court; we 
are not going to prosecute these: tres-
passing; shoplifting; theft under $250; 
disorderly conduct; drug possession 
with intent to distribute; malicious de-
struction of property; breaking and en-
tering, so long as the defender was try-
ing to sleep or escape the cold; resist-
ing arrest. 
And that is not even the entire list. 
What do they need a DA for? 
So if a violent felon could steal $200 
worth of goods, have large amounts of 
drugs, break into someone’s home, re-
sist arrest—and the DA’s office would 
not even bother to prosecute these 
crimes. Makes a lot of sense to me. 
If all of that sounds crazy to you, you 
are right. But these are the actual poli-
cies and the real-world effects. 
And now Rollins, this same district 
attorney in Boston, who decided she is 
just going to take a vacation than 
being a district attorney and not try to 
convict anybody, this Ms. Rollins has 
been appointed by President Biden to 
be the U.S. Attorney for Massachu-
setts. He is giving the person who de-
criminalized resisting arrest and all 
these other laws a promotion. That is 
from our President. I wonder what Fed-
eral crimes she will decide aren’t worth 
processing. 
There is surely somebody in Boston 
who can do the job. 
Yet President Biden is the only one 
saying Republicans are lying. He said 
that just a couple of weeks ago about 
Democrats wanting to defund the po-
lice. He said it is Republicans. 
I will tell you what is also not help-
ing to make our neighborhoods safer: 
the growing crisis at our southern bor-
der—absolute shame. And the Biden ad-
ministration completely, completely 
lacks the urgency to fix it, and it is 
getting worse every day. I guess no-
body cares. 
We have already surpassed 1 million 
illegal 
immigrants 
since 
President 
Biden was inaugurated. And remember, 
this data is looking at the illegal im-
migrants and the drugs that Customs

and Border Protection catches. We 
don’t know how many have slipped by 
or how many pounds of dope have 
slipped by. We just know the ones that 
we have caught. 
President Biden is only making mat-
ters worse, folks. As our colleagues on 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
ment Affairs Committee found, the 
Biden administration is spending $2 bil-
lion to not build a wall. We are paying 
$2 billion. Taxpayers in this country 
are paying $2 billion to not build a 
wall. That is right. That is $3 million, 
every day, of your taxpayer money 
wasted just to not build something 
that would help fix this crisis. 
The bare minimum we should expect 
to happen at the border would be to 
make sure illegal immigrants we do ap-
prehend have a court date so a judge 
can review their asylum claim. I mean, 
that is common sense. But, according 
to a recent report, 50,000 illegal immi-
grants have been released into the 
United States in the last few months 
without a court date. Yet only 13 per-
cent of those have bothered to show 
back up—13 percent. We are going to 
trust them to come over here and just 
do it on their own. That is not going to 
happen. 
At best, this hurts those who come 
into this country actually looking to 
plead their asylum case. Congress 
needs to pass my bill, S. 1007, that 
would require the DHS to provide a no-
tice to appear before releasing the ille-
gal immigrants into our country. It 
just makes common sense. But, as we 
have seen, too many folks in charge 
don’t have any common sense when it 
comes to enforcing the law. 
Everybody can see violent crime ris-
ing in big cities. They can see the 
Biden administration turning a blind 
eye to a continually growing catas-
trophe on the southern border. The 
American people are right to question 
President Biden and the Democrats’ 
commitment to the rule of law, to 
question their commitment to keeping 
our citizens and neighborhoods safe. 
I am painting a pretty bleak picture 
here, but my job is to call it like I see 
it. But there are things we in the Sen-
ate can do to make the situation bet-
ter. We can do things here, right in this 
room right here, to make things better. 
It starts with everybody fully sup-
porting our law enforcement because, if 
we don’t, one day we are going to re-
gret it. We need to improve morale and 
recruit the best and brightest in our 
police forces to keep our communities 
safe. 
We should also empower all law en-
forcement to address the negative ef-
fect at our border. This is the local and 
State police. The Empowering Law En-
forcement Act that I introduced would 
give them the power to take over for 
ICE. 
My bill would grant this and give 
them the authority to investigate and 
identify an illegal immigrant who has 
entered the U.S., which we at this mo-
ment don’t have. If the Biden adminis-
tration won’t enforce the law, let’s give 
local and State law enforcement the 
opportunity to do it. 
Folks, wanting safe communities is 
something every American wants and 
deserves. We elect public officials. We 
pay taxes and trust our governments to 
ensure safety for the greatest number 
of people possible. 
It is pretty much impossible to have 
good jobs and good schools if you don’t 
have safe neighborhoods, and it doesn’t 
take a rocket scientist to see that. If 
the people don’t feel safe, their govern-
ment and we as government officials 
have failed to perform its most basic 
function. Failure of this is not an op-
tion. 
So to reverse this rise in crime, let’s 
support the very people who have put 
their lives on the line every day. I cer-
tainly do, and I encourage the Presi-
dent and Members of this body to sup-
port every member of our law enforce-
ment. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise in support of the legislation that is 
before us, the bipartisan infrastructure 
package. I applaud all of those who 
have worked so hard so that we could 
have this legislation before us. 
It is desperately needed when we look 
at the status of our infrastructure 
today, the aged systems that we have 
across our Nation. In Maryland, we 
have some infrastructure that dates 
back over a century and a half ago. 
We need a generational investment 
to modernize our infrastructure, and 
the legislation before us does exactly 
that. It will make the United States 
more competitive and create a lot of 
good-paying jobs. It will deal with the 
growing 
backlog 
of 
infrastructure 
projects that we have in each one of 
our States. 
I applaud the work that brought us 
to this point. I particularly am pleased 
that the legislation incorporates the 
work done by the Environment and 
Public Works Committee as it relates 
to transportation, infrastructure, and 
water infrastructure. 
I particularly want to acknowledge 
the leadership of our committee, Sen-
ators CARPER and CAPITO. I was proud 
to be the chair of the subcommittee on 
infrastructure, working with Senator 
CRAMER
and 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH, 
which contributed greatly, particularly 
to the water infrastructure. 
I also want to applaud the leadership 
of President Biden. It was his leader-
ship that has brought us to this mo-
ment, his vision for America’s future, 
what we need, and he found a way for 
us to move forward on modernizing in-
frastructure. 
So let me first, if I might, talk a lit-
tle bit about the transportation parts 
of this bill that I am particularly 
pleased about. Clearly, we see a signifi-
cant increase in our investments in 
roads, bridges, transit systems, rail, 
airports, ports, and waterways. We can 
talk about some of the specifics, and I 
am going to do that. 
But first I want to applaud the ef-
forts that we have made to move for-
ward in new directions. This bill, for 
the first time, in a major reauthoriza-
tion of our surface transportation, ac-
knowledges the realities of climate 
change. We know what is happening in 
our 
communities. 
The 
increasing 
amount of flooding, droughts, wildfires, 
and extreme weather events are fright-
ening to all of us. 
In my State of Maryland, I can point 
to one community, Ellicott City, which 
has seen two 100-year floods in less 
than 24 months. The situation is dire, 
and we need to act on it. 
The legislation before us provides $18 
billion in reducing carbon emissions 
and strengthening resilience and build-
ing electric charging stations and al-
ternative fuel infrastructure. That is 
what we need to do, and I am pleased 
that the legislation addresses those 
issues. 
In a second area, I was pleased that 
this bill has a significant increase in 
the 
transportation 
alternative 
pro-
grams that I authored. This increased 
funding will make it easier for our 
local governments to move forward on 
projects that are important to their 
priorities. We are talking about better 
sidewalks and bike paths and dealing 
with safety. 
We are seeing an alarming increase 
in fatalities on our highways and roads 
and community roads. The TAP pro-
gram will allow us to deal with those 
issues. We all need to be able to get 
around our community without using 
our cars, and the TAP program makes 
this a priority so we can enjoy our 
communities and we have local deci-
sion making in the use of our transpor-
tation funds. 
I am also very pleased that this legis-
lation has a justice component to it. I 
worked long and hard with Senator 
CARPER and others in dealing with re-
connecting our communities that had 
been divided because of highways that 
had been put in a community that did 
not help that community. When we 
find out the communities that are 
most disproportionately affected, they 
are generally minority communities. 
I will give you a good example. Let 
me use my hometown of Baltimore 
City. A highway was built in the 1960s 
that was never completed. We call it 
the ‘‘highway to nowhere.’’ It is the 
Franklin-Mulberry Corridor. If you go 
to West Baltimore, you will see this 
gully that is a blight to the commu-
nity. It divides communities. Three 
thousand residents, mostly African- 
American, are directly impacted by 
this ‘‘highway to nowhere.’’ It isolates 
neighborhoods such as Harlem Park. 
This legislation provides a billion dol-
lars as a start to reconnecting commu-
nities that have been divided by high-
ways. 
I know this is good news for the peo-
ple of Baltimore and these commu-
nities and, for other communities

around the Nation where the transpor-
tation program has hurt their commu-
nity, not helped their community. 
As I pointed out, there is increased 
investments in all of our modes of 
transportation. 
This past week, I was with Secretary 
Buttigieg in Baltimore and with Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN. The Port of Balti-
more is the economic engine of our 
community. Hundreds of thousands of 
jobs directly depend upon it. Baltimore 
is prepared for the super-Panamax. 
Thanks to the partnership with the 
Federal Government, this legislation 
will allow us to be more competitive in 
our ports, creating more jobs in our 
community. 
I also pointed out the Howard Street 
Tunnel that was recently authorized 
under an INFRA grant, which will 
allow double-stacking going through a 
tunnel that is over 100 years old, 
through downtown Baltimore. This will 
make our community much more com-
petitive. This bill provides additional 
funding for INFRA grants. 
And then Maryland, like every State 
in this Nation, has significant backlogs 
in dealing with our bridges. I can men-
tion the American Legion Bridge, right 
around here, or the Johnson Bridge, in 
Southern Maryland, and the list goes 
on and on and on. This bill will allow 
us to get to some of those bridges. 
Let me talk a moment, if I might, 
about transit. We need public transit. 
Our workers need to be able to get to 
work. We need to be much more sen-
sitive to our environment and getting 
people out of their automobiles. We 
waste too much time in congestion. I 
can’t tell you how many hours are 
wasted every day because of unneces-
sary congestion. Transit—public tran-
sit—helps us deal with those chal-
lenges. 
This bill takes a quantum leap for-
ward on the transit programs. I was 
particularly pleased that it includes a 
reauthorization of the WMATA pro-
gram for the transit system in this re-
gion. I call it the Nation’s transit sys-
tem, since it is used so much by Fed-
eral workers in order to get to work. It 
extends the authorization of $150 mil-
lion a year from the Federal Govern-
ment through this decade. 
Particularly, I want to thank my col-
leagues in this region, Senators WAR-
NER and KAINE and VAN HOLLEN. The 
four of us worked together to make 
sure we got the reauthorization in-
cluded in this legislation. 
Then, I want to acknowledge and I 
want to thank particularly Senator 
BROWN for his help on this. There is 
now language in this bill that will 
allow those lines that were previously 
eligible for capital contributions but 
did not go forward to be able to be re-
considered for Federal partnerships in 
capital construction on transit. 
We have a rapid rail line in Balti-
more City, known as the Red Line, 
that was stopped by our Governor. We 
are hopeful that we can restart that. It 
is needed for dealing with public tran-
sit in Baltimore. That project would 
then now be eligible for consideration 
for Federal funding. And I would hope 
that the leadership in Maryland would 
take advantage of this opportunity and 
put the Red Line back in the equation. 
I want to talk a little bit about water 
projects. The Environment and Public 
Works Committee bill that we worked 
on, which is the basis of this bill on 
water infrastructure, passed this body 
by a vote of 89–2. It deals with the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act, increasing funding in all 
those categories. 
We have tremendous backlogs in 
water infrastructure in our commu-
nity. We have waterlines that are over 
100 years old still being used in our 
communities. This bill will help us deal 
with that backlog. It includes author-
izations that I sponsored, including af-
fordability. 
I want to thank Senator WICKER, my 
cosponsor on this. 
This would allow grants so that low- 
income families can afford their water 
bills. I can tell you that in Maryland 
and in many other communities around 
the Nation, people can no longer afford 
their water bills because so much pres-
sure has been put on the ratepayers. 
This bill will set up a pilot program 
similar to a LIHEAP program to help 
low-income families deal with their 
water costs. 
I also authored an authorization bill 
for resiliency grants with Senator CAP-
ITO to deal with extreme weather con-
ditions and cyber security issues, and I 
was pleased to see that included in the 
legislation. 
I do want to express my disappoint-
ment. There are things in this bill I am 
sure all of us are not satisfied with. I 
was disappointed that the bill does not 
fund those new authorized programs, as 
was included in the legislation that 
passed this body and was recommended 
by the Environment and Public Works 
Committee. I hope we will have a 
chance during the appropriations proc-
ess to get funding for these new au-
thorized programs. 
I was pleased that President Biden’s 
initiative to remove lead pipes was in-
cluded. I can tell you that in Balti-
more, we have significant lead pipe 
issues, particularly in our school sys-
tem, and I am glad to see that those 
programs will be funded. 
I was pleased also that we are moving 
ahead on PFOS, which is a pollutant in 
our community as a result of Federal 
installations. I was pleased to see that 
we will be able to move forward in 
that. 
And then broadband, we all know we 
need broadband infrastructure. It is in-
cluded in this bill. The Brookings Insti-
tution indicates that in the spring of 
2020, when we went into lockdown in 
our schools, 12 million out of 55 million 
students did not have access to classes 
online. That is a shocking number, and 
look at what they lost during this past 
year. 
In Maryland, it is estimated that as 
many as 324,000 people in rural Mary-
land do not have access to broadband, 
and 96,000 households in the Baltimore 
region 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
broadband. We must do better. Our 
goal should be that every house should 
have access to high-speed internet, af-
fordable 
internet. 
This 
legislation 
moves us forward on both access and 
affordability on broadband. That is 
critically important, and I am glad to 
see that it is included. 
As much as I support this legislation, 
I have to express my disappointment as 
to how this bill is paid for. As chair-
man of the Small Business Committee, 
I helped develop the programs that 
helped small businesses during COVID– 
19. They were lifesavers for small busi-
ness. It saved small businesses. It saved 
our community. It saved jobs, and it 
saved the growth engine for innovation 
in our community. 
One tool that we used that was ex-
tremely important was the Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan Program and Ad-
vance Program. Over 4 million EIDL 
loans have been granted, in excess of 
$230 billion. These grants help save 
businesses. These loans help save busi-
nesses. These are for the smaller of the 
small businesses. They are the ones 
that use it. These are low-interest, 30- 
year loans. We have had 6 million small 
businesses take advantage of the EIDL 
Advance Program, $23 billion. These 
are the differences between staying 
afloat or going under. The GAO esti-
mated this past week that 86 percent of 
the EIDL loans went to our most vul-
nerable small businesses, 10 employees 
or less. 
So why am I talking about it? Be-
cause this bill takes away the $13.5 bil-
lion from the EIDL Program—the 
EIDL loan program—just at the time 
where we have small businesses that 
are going to need these loans. We see 
an increase in wildfires. Hurricane sea-
son is coming. We are not through 
COVID–19 yet, and yet they take away 
these funds. These are the most lever-
aged funds we have available. For the 
few Federal dollars we put into it, we 
leverage much larger amounts of loans. 
Do we really want to cut back on the 
ability 
to 
help 
small 
businesses 
through these long-term loans? Unfor-
tunately, taking this money away does 
exactly that. 
In addition, it takes $17.5 billion from 
the Advance Program under EIDL. 
These are the grants that go to small 
businesses that can’t afford to take out 
loans. 
Now, we know under a previous ad-
ministration, they put a $150,000 cap on 
the EIDL loan program and $1,000 per 
employee on the Advance Program. 
Well, the Biden administration wants 
to increase the size of the loans up to 
the first $500,000 and then $2 million 
but also to give $10,000 to the busi-
nesses that need it the most under ad-
vances. 
We have taken this money away—in 
total, about $35 billion. It is going to 
make it virtually impossible for us to 
be able to do what we need to do for

small businesses. That is not right, and 
we are going to need to do something 
about it. 
I might point out that we have the 
Restaurant Revitalization Act—and ev-
eryone here was very proud to help our 
restaurants—that has been oversub-
scribed. We are going to need a lot 
more money to be put into that pro-
gram. Yet you are taking away our ca-
pacity in this bill to help fund small 
businesses. That is not right, and I 
hope I will continue to work with my 
colleagues so we can find a path for-
ward to help America’s small busi-
nesses. 
We all talk about helping small busi-
nesses. Here is one example where we 
took the step in the wrong direction. 
We don’t have to choose between build-
ing modern infrastructure or helping 
small businesses. We can do both, and I 
am disappointed at this moment that 
we are not going to be able to do every-
thing we need to do to help the small 
business communities in our country. 
I hope I will be able to revisit this at 
a later time. But it doesn’t dull my en-
thusiasm for this very important legis-
lation that I urge my colleagues to 
support. It will make a quantum leap 
forward in America’s competitiveness 
and create more jobs for America’s fu-
ture. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
would like to rise and speak to the in-
frastructure bill that is before us and, 
specifically, about a component of the 
infrastructure bill. My colleague, ear-
lier, Senator TUBERVILLE
from Ala-
bama, said that when he goes home he 
speaks to people in his State, and he 
always gets a consistent message. I, 
too, get that consistent message: bet-
ter jobs, greater safety for their fam-
ily, and a better future for our country. 
And this infrastructure package ad-
dresses those concerns. 
Now, the infrastructure package is 
about roads and bridges and highways, 
ports and waterways, increased access 
to broadband in areas that don’t have 
it now, flood mitigation, coastal res-
toration. These are things that will 
contribute to better jobs, more safety, 
and a better future for our country. 
But, first, let me dispel some myths. 
There are some misconceptions out 
there about this bill. One misconcep-
tion is that it is somehow the same as 
the $3.5 trillion bill that people have 
heard about that Democrats have pro-
posed, increasing taxes to a record 
basis and increasing our national debt 
when obviously we are pushing up on 
the debt limit. This is not that bill. 
This bill is about roads and bridges 
and broadband and flood protection. 
That bill is about everything else. This 
bill is about improving the quality of 
life for our families and improving the 
future for our country. That bill is 
about a sugar high on an economy 
which is already in an inflationary 
mode. These are two different bills. So 
I am speaking about the one that has 
86-percent approval in two straight 
polls by the American citizens. 
The other concern is that this will 
contribute to inflation. Again, that is 
confusing it with the $3.5 trillion wish 
list that my Democratic colleagues 
have. No, the bill that we are pro-
posing, with $550 billion in new spend-
ing over 5 years for roads, bridges, and 
highways, is judged to not be infla-
tionary, to actually improve our econ-
omy over time. Lastly, that somehow 
this infrastructure bill that we propose 
is somehow Republicans playing along 
with Democrats in a way that is bad 
for our country. 
Let me point out that President 
Trump proposed a $1.5 trillion infra-
structure bill. We put up $550 billion in 
new spending. He proposed $1.5 trillion. 
Only 5 percent of his was paid for, 
whereas ours is paid for. 
To make the point, this is something 
that Republicans have proposed in the 
past, that Democrats have proposed in 
the past, and this version is something 
which Democrats and Republicans can 
support. It is paid for, and it does help 
the American people. How does it help 
the American people? It gives them 
better jobs, increases the safety of 
their families, and gives a better future 
for our country. 
Let me give some ideas about how 
that can occur. There is $110 billion for 
roads, bridges, and highways, not just 
to repair some, to construct some oth-
ers, but also for the safety of those 
that are being rebuilt or being built— 
$110 billion. 
We speak about jobs and safety and a 
better future. Clearly, we talked about 
safety. Think about the jobs that will 
be created by this construction of these 
highways. Think about the better fu-
ture because these roads and bridges 
will last for decades. Some person who 
is now a child will drive over a bridge 
as an adult, and her life will be better 
because of the highway that this 
money paid for. 
There is $10 billion for ports and wa-
terways, those liquid highways that 
take our goods from our country to 
around the world and bring those goods 
from around the world back to our 
country, along the way creating jobs 
for hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans. 
By the way, transporting products by 
water is the most environmentally 
sound way to transport goods. 
This investment in our ports and wa-
terways—again, creating jobs, increas-
ing the safety—also gives us a better 
future for our economy, a better future 
for our workers, a better future for our 
families, and a better future for our 
country. 
There is $16 billion for the Army 
Corps of Engineers for, among other 
things, to address coastal erosion, 
which is occurring nationwide. My 
State has lost more land mass than 
any other State in the Nation. My 
State has lost as much land as is in the 
entire State of Delaware. But other 
States are losing land, too. 
I saw a picture recently of the Gold 
Coast, that very swank area in the city 
of Chicago on Lake Michigan, and it 
showed how the coastline had eroded 
over time, and now, waves from Lake 
Michigan are lapping up onto the road 
in front of these very expensive apart-
ment complexes. This is not on the At-
lantic, the Pacific, or the Gulf of Mex-
ico; this is on a Great Lake. I saw an-
other picture of the beach off of North 
Carolina, which in the last 150 years 
has receded—I think it is 500 feet. So 
homes that formerly had a distant view 
of the water now have waves coming up 
to their lawn. That is happening na-
tionwide—no place more than my State 
in Louisiana. 
This bill makes a significant invest-
ment in coastal erosion and protecting 
those people who live on the coastlines. 
It will create jobs as this is addressed. 
It will increase the safety of those 
folks who live in such areas. It gives a 
better future for our country. 
There is $65 billion for broadband, 
prioritizing those places without serv-
ice and those places with poor service. 
I think of a place in my own State; for 
example, Opelousas, LA, a small town 
on I–49. Think of a parent there who 
wants her daughter to be able to study 
Mandarin Chinese. There might be peo-
ple there who speak Mandarin Chinese, 
but they are not the people teaching 
school. If she has broadband internet, 
she gets the same educational experi-
ence as someone who lives in New Orle-
ans or Baton Rouge or Shreveport. We 
need to give every child in this country 
the same access to that educational op-
portunity. 
I am a doctor. Most people know 
that. I also think of the expansion of 
telehealth 
and 
telemental 
health. 
Right now, our country has a shortage 
of adolescent psychiatrists. If we have 
rural broadband or broadband in areas 
of our cities which are currently poorly 
served, the adolescent psychiatrist can 
be in her office in Lafayette, LA, doing 
a visit, an interview with a child who 
lives in DeRidder. A place that won’t 
have a pediatric or adolescent psychia-
trist has access to real-time visits be-
cause of the money that is in this bill. 
Economic development. I once spoke 
to somebody who was thinking of set-
ting up a distribution center in North 
Louisiana in a place ideally situated to 
get all the towns around, but it did not 
have broadband internet. With this 
bill, 
that 
economic 
development 
project takes root because now that in-
vestor has the ability to manage inven-
tory to receive orders and to commu-
nicate with drivers, all because rural 
broadband has been made a reality— 
creating jobs, increasing safety, giving 
that community and our country a bet-
ter future. 
Let me just mention one more thing 
in the economic aspect and safety as-
pect of this. There is money for sewer, 
water, and for drainage. If I think of 
the four corners of my State, but I am 
sure every person could think of the 
four corners of their State—and I think

of Hawaii as being a round State, so I 
am not sure I even think of those four 
corners—but if I think of New Orleans, 
Shreveport, Monroe, and Lake Charles 
and all points in between, there was a 
pent-up demand to address water and 
sewer and drainage. This bill puts the 
money out there, which can be com-
bined with other appropriations, which 
can meet the needs for those folks in 
my community. 
I also want to emphasize some of the 
environmental aspects of this bill. We 
have billions being put forward to 
Superfund and brownfield sites. Now, 
Louisiana has 27 priority sites of those 
nationwide requiring funding for the 
Superfund or brownfield. 
We also have 4.75 billion to cap aban-
doned oil wells. That will improve con-
ditions not only in Louisiana but 
across the Nation. 
It also includes the bill I wrote with 
Senator COONS of Delaware called the 
SCALE Act. The SCALE Act helps 
build this carbon dioxide pipeline that 
will take CO2
from these manufac-
turing plants that are producing a 
product that emits CO2, and it would 
build pipelines to sequester that carbon 
dioxide beneath the ground or to allow 
that CO2 to be used in another product 
line, putting to work pipefitters, de-
creasing the carbon intensity of our en-
vironment, and giving a better future 
for our planet—jobs, safety, and a bet-
ter future. 
I have already mentioned the $16 bil-
lion going to the Army Corps of Engi-
neers for coastal restoration and other 
projects. 
This bill is an example of what Con-
gress should do. It is focused upon jobs 
and safety and a better quality of life. 
This is good for the American worker. 
It is good for American families. It is 
good for the United States of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in a 
State as big as mine, reliable transpor-
tation infrastructure is absolutely es-
sential. We are home to both the larg-
est network of highways, as well as the 
largest number of bridges in the coun-
try. We are also a major hub for im-
ports and exports both along the gulf 
coast and the southern border. 
As we continue to welcome more new 
Texans every day, the strain on our in-
frastructure is growing. It takes a lot 
of planning and maintenance to get all 
29 million Texans, our visitors, and 
crucial cargo around the State safely 
and efficiently. When you add in 
broadband, airports, levees, waterways, 
it is easy to see how big an under-
taking this entire process is. 
I continue to hear from my constitu-
ents back home, like I am sure we all 
do, about the need for Federal funding 
to help repair, maintain, and expand 
infrastructure across our States. But 
we just can’t keep adding expenses to 
the taxpayers’ credit card. We have to 
figure out how to pay for it. 
Earlier this year, President Biden 
floated his idea for an absolutely mas-
sive infrastructure bill totaling $2.6 
trillion. It included a broad range of 
controversial and, frankly, overpriced 
programs, all funded by massive tax 
hikes on the American taxpayer. 
The good news is, that is not the bill 
we are considering today. A bipartisan 
group of our colleagues worked with 
the White House to find common 
ground and get a bill to the floor with 
support from both sides. The 2,700-page 
text was just released last night, and I 
know, like everybody else, I am still in 
the process with my staff of evaluating 
just how it will impact my State and 
our Nation. 
Our colleagues who negotiated and 
drafted this legislation put in a lot of 
long hours and hard work to reach an 
agreement. I commend them for their 
efforts. 
I am eager to see a score from the 
Congressional Budget Office to provide 
a better understanding of the true cost 
of this legislation. But even the pro-
ponents who negotiated this deal con-
cede that, at least before the $118 bil-
lion transfer from the general revenue 
fund last night, that even then, only 
about half of it was paid for. 
I believe there, so far, have been 
some missed opportunities, one being 
reforms to the highway trust fund 
itself. For years, the highway trust 
fund has faced major shortfalls and, to 
a serious degree, Texans have footed 
the bill for those shortfalls because we 
are one of the States that receive less 
than we contribute. For every dollar 
we put in the highway trust fund, only 
95 cents comes back to my State. That 
is not the same treatment of every 
State. In fact, we received the lowest 
rate of return than any other State. 
I don’t think it is a stretch to say it 
is unfair that Texans subsidize infra-
structure projects in every other State, 
but that is only part of the issue here. 
The highway trust fund has been oper-
ating in the red for more than a dec-
ade. The current state of the highway 
trust fund is unsustainable, and unless 
something changes, we are going to be 
in dire straits—even more dire straits 
in just a few years. 
The importance of the highway trust 
fund is that we have always believed in 
a user fee model when it comes to in-
frastructure. The people who use it are 
the ones to pay to maintain it and ex-
pand it. But rather than make reforms 
to the formula to make the fund sol-
vent, this bill throws more borrowed 
money at the problem. 
As I said, just this morning, I learned 
that another $118 billion was proposed 
to be transferred to the highway trust 
fund with no reforms to help put it 
back on sound financial footing. This is 
quite a step away from the user fee 
model where those who use the infra-
structure are the ones who pay for it. 
This is a transfer from general revenue, 
from the taxpayer, into the highway 
trust fund. This inclusion was a big 
surprise to me, and in all the conversa-
tions we have had about this legisla-
tion over the past several weeks, I 
didn’t hear a word about a highway 
trust fund bailout. 
The massive bill, as I said, was 
dropped last night, and we are still try-
ing to comb through the 2,700 pages of 
text, which, at this point, appears to be 
full of surprises, and I will just men-
tion one of them. 
This 
bill 
should 
not 
be 
rushed 
through the Senate without providing 
all Members a chance to read it, to un-
derstand it, and offer their suggestions 
to improve it. I have been working 
with some of our colleagues on amend-
ments to this legislation to provide le-
gitimate pay-fors. Since this bill didn’t 
go through the regular committee 
process but was really cobbled together 
by a negotiation—again, in a bipar-
tisan fashion that I commend for their 
efforts—but it makes it all the more 
important that since this is the first 
time that many of us have seen the en-
tire 2,700-page bill, that it be subject to 
an open amendment process. 
This legislation will have impact on 
every State in the country, and every 
Member of the Senate should have the 
opportunity to weigh in and offer 
changes. Members of the bipartisan 
group have committed to a process 
that allows Senators on both sides to 
offer changes to this bill, and in the 
days ahead, I hope the majority leader 
will allow that to happen, and we will 
have a robust amendment process. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, my State is no stranger to tragedy. 
In recent years, we have experienced 
hurricanes, tornadoes, a crippling win-
ter freeze, and other natural disasters 
that have tested our resiliency. Sadly, 
too, some of our communities have ex-
perienced mass shootings. 
Tomorrow, Texans will mark a sol-
emn anniversary: 2 years since a gun-
man stormed into a Walmart in El 
Paso, TX, and opened fire. Twenty- 
three people died; dozens were injured; 
and the lives of countless El Pasoans 
were forever changed. My friend, the 
former mayor, Dee Margo, said at the 
time: 
Hate will not overcome love. Hate will not 
define who we are. 
This shooting was, undoubtedly, hate 
in its purest form. The shooter was a 
White supremacist who carried out an 
act that could only be described as do-
mestic terrorism. Our Hispanic neigh-
bors and friends were purposely tar-
geted, and both Texans and Mexicans 
were killed by this wicked individual. 
In the face of this pure evil, El 
Pasoans responded with love. Off-duty 
surgeons and doctors rushed to the hos-
pital to save as many lives as they 
could. El Pasoans were comforted by 
their 
faith 
leaders, 
like 
Father 
Marquez, who stayed up all night with 
17 families and sat beside them as they 
were told their loved ones had not 
made it. And hundreds of Texans lined 
up to give blood. I was proud to be one 
of those 3,000 donations at the Vitalant 
centers in El Paso and Las Cruces. 
A young El Pasoan, Ruben Martinez, 
was just in sixth grade when this mass

shooting took place. In the days that 
followed, he created the El Paso Chal-
lenge, where he and his mom performed 
23 random acts of kindness in honor of 
the 23 victims. Two years later, they 
are still keeping up that tradition and 
recently gave out roses at San Jacinto 
Plaza to remind people to spread love 
and kindness. 
El Paso, a community that saw the 
face of evil, unequivocally chose love, 
and I am grateful to Texans like Ruben 
who have continued to make the 
choice, day after day, to honor the 
lives of the 23 whom we lost. 
As we remember the lives that were 
lost just 2 years ago and the families 
and the victims that many of us com-
forted in the hospitals in the aftermath 
of this, we are also—we also carry the 
painful reminder that justice has not 
yet been served. Last week, the Federal 
hearing for the accused shooter was 
postponed until November, and the 
State’s case continues to await a trial 
date due to delays stemming from 
COVID’s impact on our court system. 
My heart is with the families and 
friends looking for closure who must 
now deal with this additional delay in 
justice being served. 
I know I speak for all Texans when I 
say that the 2-year anniversary ap-
proaches tomorrow; that, as it ap-
proaches, we all stand in solidarity 
with El Pasoans and remember the en-
during strength and spirit of this vi-
brant community. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Penn-
sylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I 
wanted to offer some remarks about 
two of our former colleagues who 
passed away, and I know many have al-
ready spoken about both of their lives 
and their contributions, their public 
service. And so I am not speaking 
today about the pending legislative 
business but just wanted to make sure 
that I took some time today to talk 
about both of these individuals. I will 
go in the order of their passing just in 
the last week, really. 
The first is the former Senator from 
Wyoming, Mike Enzi, who served in 
this institution since being elected in 
1996 and then left the Senate after 2020 
was concluded. I will have a longer 
statement that I will ask consent to 
put in the RECORD. But I just wanted to 
share some personal reflections be-
cause sometimes, when you outline 
someone’s career in a position, whether 
it is in government or otherwise, that 
doesn’t really tell the story about who 
they were, and we all have different 
impressions, but it is remarkable how 
often, in the last couple of days, Mem-
bers of both parties in the Senate have 
commented on Mike Enzi as a person. 
I said last weekend at the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, of which he and I were both 
members and overlapped for a number 
of years, that Mike Enzi was the par-
agon of decency, and that is probably 
an understatement. ‘‘Decency’’ isn’t a 
word that is often attached to public 
officials, unfortunately, but in Mike’s 
case, it applied. He was a decent human 
being and treated everyone with re-
spect, and we could all learn more than 
one lesson from the way he treated 
people and the way he conducted him-
self as a person and the way he con-
ducted himself as a U.S. Senator. 
Just in terms of work, a number of us 
can share stories about issues we 
worked with Mike on. I can share one 
or two. 
One, in particular, I remember a bill 
that had not been ‘‘reauthorized.’’ That 
is another fancy Washington word for 
taking a policy or taking a program 
and, in a sense, reinstituting it by up-
dating it and, maybe, getting author-
ization to have either new policy or 
new appropriations or additional ap-
propriations. But we wanted to reau-
thorize the Perkins Career and Tech-
nical Education Program, but the bill 
had not been acted on. The proposal, 
the bill itself, or versions of the bill 
were around for something like, oh, 
gosh, about 12 years, between 2006 and 
2018, before we finally got it done. 
I won’t walk through the policy but 
just share a personal story that, when 
Mike Enzi and I were working on the 
Senate version of it—there was another 
version in the House very similar, if 
not identical, but it needed work in 
both Chambers—we were working with 
then-Chairman Alexander, Lamar Alex-
ander and the ranking member, PATTY 
MURRAY. So the four of us had to work 
very hard to get it done. But once it 
was done, I remember standing here on 
the floor, and Mike Enzi was standing 
on that side of the floor talking about 
what we had done. And as I was paying 
tribute to his work and commending 
him, I thought: My goodness. I may be 
getting him in trouble back home by 
having a Democrat compliment him so 
much, and he was complimenting my 
work. But I remember that because it 
was a typical—in some ways, a very 
typical Mike Enzi work product. It de-
fied resolution for a long time, but he 
stayed at it, and he stayed in the room, 
so to speak, until we had it done. 
So I want to thank him for that work 
that will allow more and more Ameri-
cans to have the opportunity to have 
that career in technical education that 
they would not have or at least not 
would have it in the manner that the 
bill set forth, which was a dramatic 
and substantial improvement in that 
kind of career in technical education, 
from a Federal Government perspec-
tive. 
The final thought that I will share— 
because I want to be brief because I 
also have a statement to submit—are 
on our budget votes. 
As many Americans know, if they are 
watching—and 
maybe 
they 
aren’t 
watching when we do a budget resolu-
tion, but it is vote after vote, hour 
after hour, often well into not just the 
evening but well into the next morn-
ing. And to preside over that, as Mike 
was at the time as the chairman of the 
Budget Committee, I just recall him 
standing at the lectern, hour after 
hour, having to comment on every 
amendment, whether he opposed it or 
supported it, and if he opposed it, of 
course, he had to make an argument 
against it. That is part of the job of 
being the chair, standing there all 
those hours. 
But even when he was making the 
case against Democratic amendments, 
which was often, and stating his oppo-
sition, there was no snarl; there was 
no—rarely political rhetoric. He would 
just state his objections very forth-
rightly and very soberly and then move 
on. There was no finger-pointing, no 
demonization of the other point of 
view. So I always appreciated how he 
did that in an environment where there 
often is that kind of invective flying 
back and forth. 
So, Mike Enzi, when I say he was the 
paragon of decency, that applied to his 
whole life, and we know how terribly 
his family must miss him and how his 
State mourns the loss of Mike Enzi, 
but that loss was felt in a bipartisan 
fashion here on the Senate floor and 
within the Senate family. 
Madam President, today, I wish to 
pay tribute to the distinguished life 
and career of Senator Michael B. Enzi, 
who passed away on July 26, 2021. Sen-
ator Enzi was an honorable public serv-
ant and decent man who always had a 
kind word for everyone in our shared 
office hallway in the Russell Senate Of-
fice Building. I was privileged to have 
spent 13 years working alongside him. 
While Senator Enzi was born in 
Bremerton, WA, in 1944, he grew up in 
Wyoming, the same State he would de-
vote more than four decades of his life 
to by serving in local, State, and Fed-
eral Government. He graduated with a 
bachelor’s degree in accounting from 
George Washington University in 1966. 
Senator Enzi was dedicated to his edu-
cation and his sense of civic responsi-
bility, and he earned an MBA in retail 
marketing from the University of Den-
ver in 1968 while also serving in the 
Wyoming Air National Guard from 1967 
to 1973. After receiving his graduate de-
gree, he followed his father’s footsteps 
and worked as a shoe salesman and 
business owner. 
Senator Enzi’s long career in govern-
ment started when he was elected 
mayor of Gillette, WY, in 1974. He 
served in the Wyoming State Legisla-
ture as a member of the House of Rep-
resentatives and State Senate begin-
ning in 1987. He was elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 1996 and would go on to serve 
4 consecutive terms. It was during the 
110th Congress that we became col-
leagues and began our committee work 
together, first on the Senate Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs and later on the Com-
mittee on Finance and the Committee

on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. Senator Enzi loved ‘‘solving 
problems for folks in Wyoming and 
America,’’ and I am honored to have 
had the opportunity to work with him 
on bipartisan solutions to help Ameri-
cans. 
The passing of Senator Enzi is a ter-
rible loss for his wife, Diana; his chil-
dren, Amy, Emily and Brad; his four 
grandchildren, Trey, Lilly, Megan, and 
Allison. He will be dearly missed by his 
family, friends, and former staff. I echo 
my Senate colleagues and fellow citi-
zens when I say that we are grateful for 
his service to our Nation. May he rest 
in peace. 
REMEMBERING CARL LEVIN 
Madam President, and then just some 
additional comments on another col-
league we lost this year, this time a 
Democratic Senator, Carl Levin, who 
served the people of Michigan starting 
in 1978—I think, almost immediately 
after serving on the city council in De-
troit—and I will submit a statement 
about his life as well. 
But Carl, as well, was decent and 
honorable, and I have no doubt that 
people in both parties had that same 
impression of him, dealing with him— 
again, I will say—as a person and as a 
U.S. Senator, as a public official. 
Carl Levin had a work ethic which 
was second to none. I don’t ever re-
member him in a setting where he 
wasn’t working. It was as if he was 
never relaxed and kind of turned off. 
He was always on the floor, trying to 
get support for an amendment, trying 
to get support for a bill. And the dif-
ference between Carl and many of us is 
that he knew the detail of that bill 
sometimes as well or better, maybe, 
than the staff. He knew every part of 
the policy. If he were allowed to be on 
the Senate floor, with his jacket off, he 
would roll up his sleeves. 
Someone was telling a story the 
other day how that was kind of an 
image we had of Carl; that his sleeves 
were always rolled up when he was 
working, but, of course, on the Senate 
floor, he wasn’t allowed to do that. But 
it was emblematic, I think, that rolling 
up of his sleeves when he was traveling 
or addressing constituents or the like— 
it was emblematic of his work ethic 
and the scholarship that he put into 
the work he did for the people of Michi-
gan and often for, of course, the work-
ers. There have been stories that have 
been told in the last couple of days 
about him carrying around his union 
card when he worked in a factory as a 
young man. 
He never forgot those workers. It 
wasn’t just a symbol of a union card in 
his wallet; he never ever stopped fight-
ing 
for 
them—workers in Detroit, 
whether they are autoworkers or oth-
erwise. 
So that is something we pay tribute 
to today, and his work on behalf of 
those who were powerless or those with 
little power, those who don’t have a 
lobbyist, those who don’t have the op-
portunity to influence legislation di-
rectly—Carl Levin always made sure 
that their voice was heard. 
And as much as he was a supporter— 
and I think a consistent and strong 
supporter—of a strong national secu-
rity, no Member of the Senate could 
say they did more than Carl Levin to 
support our national security, both in 
terms of what he supported, but in 
terms of his leadership on the Armed 
Services Committee, and ultimately as 
the chair of the committee, working in 
a very bipartisan fashion to keep us 
safe, working with Senators like John 
McCain and others, Democrat and Re-
publican alike. 
But even though in the midst of—or 
in the course of supporting national se-
curity you deal with big institutions, 
big defense contractors, big, powerful 
interests that he worked with and 
made sure were part of the best na-
tional security in the world, he was 
also very tough on those same big in-
stitutions; because, as many of you 
know—many people here in the Senate 
know, Carl was the chairman of what is 
known 
as 
the 
Permanent 
Sub-
committee on Investigations, maybe 
the most powerful subcommittee in the 
entire U.S. Senate, or at least for many 
years it was. 
And as the chairman of that sub-
committee, Carl Levin held the feet of 
powerful interests—held their feet to 
the fire over and over again with a 
cross-examination skill that very few 
Senators would possess, even Senators 
who were good lawyers. 
And Carl Levin would not let those 
powerful interests up for air if he 
thought they had information that he 
needed to extract from them in the 
public interest. And anyone who ap-
peared before him knew how tough he 
could be on the most powerful people 
and the most powerful institutions in 
the country, if not in the world. 
So we appreciate Carl Levin’s de-
cency and the honorable service that 
he rendered, but we also appreciate 
how hard he fought for people who 
didn’t have power. 
Mr. CARPER. Would the Senator 
yield the floor? 
While the Senator is still on the 
floor, we are talking about the serious 
side of Carl, and there is also a lighter 
side of Carl, as you know, and I just 
want to recall one of those today. 
I was elected to—been State treas-
urer and elected to Congress in ‘82, and 
one of the Members of my professional 
class was Sandy Levin, Carl’s brother— 
his older brother—who apparently had 
run for Governor—not successful—and 
later on got elected to the House, and 
I think he served as the Ways and 
Means Committee chair. 
But, anyway, so I got to meet Carl 
pretty early, although he didn’t join 
me here until about 20 years ago. But 
he is from Detroit and that area and 
loves the Detroit—loved the Detroit Ti-
gers, and so do I. And try to figure out 
why an Ohio State boy would end up 
being a big Tigers fan, but I was. 
Ended up on the Homeland Security 
Governmental Affairs Committee, and 
he was in charge of the Subcommittee 
on Investigations, and I ended up being 
the 
chairman 
of 
the 
committee; 
worked pretty close with Tom Coburn 
and others. 
And Carl asked me—he said he want-
ed me to come up—as chairman, he 
wanted me to come up and tour the 
border—the U.S.-Canadian border, and 
right there by Detroit on boat, by 
water, by helicopters, and so forth. 
I said: Sure. Count me in. 
We just had one—just one heck of a 
day. It was a lot of fun and very in-
formative. Got to spend time with 
Coast Guard people and others just 
very much involved in our border secu-
rity. 
And late in the day, it was opening 
day of baseball season, and the Tigers 
were playing in Minnesota, the opening 
game. It was an afternoon game. 
And after we had finished our day’s 
activities, it was moving on toward 
suppertime. He said: Let’s go to this 
area of Detroit where they have all 
these Mexican restaurants, and we will 
have dinner. 
And when we got to the restaurant, 
the Tigers game was on the radio, and 
he said let’s have a couple of libations 
and sit in his car and listen to the Ti-
gers game, and so we did. 
And the game—we were in the 7th or 
8th inning. We stayed until the very 
end, and it turned out to be a very 
sweet ending and the Tigers won the 
ballgame and we had a couple libations 
and some laughs. And then we went in-
side, and for, like, six bucks we bought 
two of the biggest dinners I have ever 
seen, and I had a wonderful time. 
But I loved Carl. Loved Sandy too. 
And the idea that Carl has left us is 
real sad. Barbara, his wife, wonderful 
woman, thank her for sharing her hus-
band with us. 
Here is an issue, on a more serious 
note, called beneficial interests, which 
involved shell corporations and some 
criminal people who are doing unto-
ward—maybe 
illicit, 
illegal 
things. 
They are using shell corporations to 
try to do those bad activities. And 
there was a question about who should 
have the authority, who should be re-
sponsible for making sure that no ne-
farious activities were taking place be-
cause of these shell corporations. 
Delaware happens to be a State 
where there are a lot of corporations. I 
think half of the New York Stock Ex-
change, half of the Fortune 500 are in-
corporated in Delaware. So we had a 
real interest in doing this, but doing it 
in a way that doesn’t unduly burden 
the State. 
This was an issue that we didn’t let 
come between our friendship. This was 
an issue that lasted and lasted and 
lasted and lasted. 
And Carl, when he went to meet our 
Maker, about a year or so before, we 
resolved that issue, and it took years 
to resolve that issue. And he was tena-
cious, his staff was tenacious, and, 
frankly, so were a lot of other folks, 
but we got the job done in a way that

I think protects the public interest and 
makes sure that government, State 
and local and Federal, are doing their 
job. 
And so, Carl, if you are listening, 
buddy, our Tigers are doing better this 
year, and hopefully they will continue 
to. 
But thank you for raising those 
points. 
Mr. CASEY. I want to thank the sen-
ior Senator from Delaware for those 
kind, personal reflections about Carl 
Levin. 
Madam President, today I wish to 
pay tribute to the life and career of 
Senator Carl Levin, who passed away 
on July 29, 2021. As the longest-serving 
senator in Michigan history, Senator 
Levin was a role model as a person and 
as a public official. 
Senator Levin was born on June 28, 
1934 in Detroit, MI, the city he would 
call home for his entire life and contin-
ually fight for during his six terms in 
the Senate. I am proud to say that he 
received his bachelor’s degree in polit-
ical science at Swarthmore College, 
which is located in my home state of 
Pennsylvania, in 1956. During his un-
dergraduate education he worked as a 
taxi driver and on an auto factory line. 
He would continue to keep his union 
card in his wallet for many years, a 
habit emblematic of his commitment 
to American workers. After graduating 
from Harvard Law School in 1959, he 
practiced law for several years before 
becoming an assistant attorney general 
and general counsel for the Michigan 
Civil Rights Commission, beginning his 
long career as a defender of civil rights. 
Senator Levin first entered elected 
office as a member of Detroit City 
Council in 1969. In 1978, he was elected 
to the U.S. Senate, where he would 
earn a reputation as an effective legis-
lator, tenacious investigator and per-
son of integrity. He understood that 
serving in political office is a public 
trust and demanded the same degree of 
accountability and transparency from 
corporations and government that his 
constituents came to expect from him. 
Whether on the floor of the Senate or 
abroad during our trip to Afghanistan 
and Pakistan in 2008 when he served as 
Chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Armed Services, Senator Levin led 
with humility and a sharp intellect. 
Senator Levin’s service in the Senate 
was the kind of public service we 
should all emulate and his death is a 
loss for our Nation and, of course, his 
loving family. My thoughts and pray-
ers are with his wife, Barbara; his three 
daughters, Kate, Laura and Eric; his 
six grandchildren; and his nephew, Con-
gressman Andy Levin, as they mourn 
his passing. May we all learn from Sen-
ator Levin’s example, and may he rest 
in peace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
AMENDMENT NOS. 2133 AND 2162 TO AMENDMENT 
NO. 2137 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing amendments be called up to the 
substitute and be reported by number:

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
don’t have an objection. I just wanted 
to say to the—to Chairman CARPER 
here and others in the bipartisan group 
and all of us here: We are ready to get 
this thing started. 
This is a great way for Members to 
say what they like and what they don’t 
like, and the amendment process is on 
its way. 
Thank you. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
would say thank you to the ranking 
member for those comments. I, too, am 
ready to get to work. This is a good 
way to do it, a couple of amendments 
that I think a lot of us can support. 
But I appreciate the consent to lock 
in votes on these two amendments. We 
will start with these and work to have 
votes on others as well, hopefully soon-
er rather than later. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

H.R. 3684 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to bring atten-
tion to the wildfires raging in our 
Western States, devastating commu-
nity after community. I am also here 
to call on my colleagues to use the on-
going 
infrastructure 
discussions 
to 
take the swift, bold action necessary 
not just to confront the current crisis 
but to address the root cause and help 
save others from having to endure 
similar fires and tragedies in the fu-
ture. 
For nearly a month now, the Bootleg 
Fire, pictured here, has been the big-
gest of 91 fires burning across 12 
States. It has been raging in Southern 
Oregon. It has burned about 415,000 
acres. Translate that into square miles. 
That is 646 square miles. Translate 
that. That is an area about 20 miles 
wide and 30 miles long, half the size of 
the State of Rhode Island reduced to 
ash and smoke. 
It is ranching country. There are not 
a lot of developed communities, but 
you still have a lot of homes getting 
burned, at least 161 homes; double that 
or roughly double that in outbuildings. 
Hundreds of vehicles have been de-
stroyed. Thousands of families have 
been forced to evacuate. 
This fire grew so large, it started 
generating its own weather system. 
Think about that. Usually, we watch 
the weather to see how the weather is 
going to influence the fire. Will rain 
and storms slow them down? Will hu-
midity slow them down a little? Will 
dry, hot conditions help them grow or, 
worst of all, hot and dry with wind? 
Well, that is not the case with the 
Bootleg Fire, which created these mas-
sive clouds rising more than 30,000 feet 
into the air, and as the air surges up, 
then below it, it pulls in air from all 
around, which feeds oxygen to the in-
ferno. Then, when that air cools and 
drops down, it pushes the bottom air 
out, spreading sparks like some living 
monster sucking in fire, intensifying 
oxygen, and then spewing out fire- 
spreading embers as the air cools and 
descends. It even generates its own 
lightning storms and spawns fire torna-
does, swirling vortexes of heat and 
flame. 
Fires are an annual occurrence in Or-
egon, but decade after decade, they are 
getting a lot worse. There are two 
major reasons for this. Climate chaos 
is one, and poor forest management is 
the other. The forests, due to climate 
chaos, are drier and more prone to fire. 
Why are they drier? Because, well, car-
bon dioxide from burning fossil fuels 
and methane gas leaking out of our 
natural gas systems are heating the

planet. So we have to pivot quickly and 
transition to renewable energy to stop 
it from getting worse. 
But that is a discussion really for an-
other day. Let’s focus today on the sec-
ond part of the challenge, which is for-
est management. 
When fires erupt, we put them out as 
fast as we can, trying to prevent dev-
astating fires like the Bootleg Fire. 
But the result of putting fires out fast 
over decade after decade after decade is 
that a lot of fuels build up on the floor 
of the forest. 
In addition, we have a lot of forests 
that are second-growth forests, with 
trees planted very close together, and 
they all grow up at about the same 
height and their canopies are touching 
each other, which makes it very easy 
for the fire to spread from tree to tree 
to tree. 
So you throw in the combination of 
longer, hotter, dryer summers and sec-
ond-growth forests, and you have the 
perfect recipe for infernos like the big 
fires we have been seeing out West. 
To reduce the risk of these dev-
astating fires in the short-run, we have 
two basic tools. One is, we reduce the 
grass and undergrowth that fuels the 
fire—we sometimes call that mowing— 
and then we do prescribed burns, and 
the second is, we thin the forest. 
Now, thinning the forest works bet-
ter in some forests than in others. For 
ponderosa pine, it works really well. 
You spread out those pine trees. They 
would never have grown so close to-
gether. In the old days, when fires reg-
ularly swept through, they would kill 
the younger trees. The older trees 
would survive, widely spaced trees. 
They would burn up the fuel on the 
floor of the forest, and it worked well. 
Other forests—wetter forests, Douglas 
fir forests, other types of forests—we 
are still trying to figure out exactly 
the best way to do forest management 
to reduce fire risk. The Bootleg Fire 
did show the effect of these types of ef-
forts. 
Over the last decades, ecologists have 
been working in the Sycan Marsh Pre-
serve. They have been thinning out the 
forest, and they have been using pre-
scribed fires. So they have been reduc-
ing the number of ponderosa pines to 
make it a less fire-prone forest. 
As the Bootleg Fire came into the 
preserve, firefighters on the ground re-
port the flames didn’t jump as easily or 
readily from treetop to treetop; they 
went back to the ground. Going back 
to the ground, where there had been 
prescribed fire, they didn’t burn as 
quickly. The fire moved a lot more 
slowly, and, in addition, it is easier for 
firefighters to get into the front of the 
fire. 
So the thinning and burning of the 
Sycan Marsh Preserve are strong proof 
of why we need to use these tools, with 
science-informed adjustments resulting 
in the most effective strategies for dif-
ferent kinds of forests. But, again, 
those strategies may not work as well 
in other types of forests, and we need 
the best science. I have asked the head 
of the Forest Service to get us the best 
science so we can apply the best strate-
gies to make different types of forests 
more fire-resilient. 
But we need to be able to fund such 
efforts on a much more massive scale. 
Out in Oregon, we have 2.3 million 
acres that have been approved environ-
mentally to be treated that aren’t 
treated because we haven’t had the 
funds. So this infrastructure bill is an 
opportunity to address so much of the 
work that needs to be done to make 
the forest more fire-resilient. 
Well, I am pleased to say that the bill 
is going to have quite a bit in it, and I 
really am pleased with this. I have 
been pushing for this for years, that we 
need to spend not millions but billions 
of dollars in forest management. So $8 
billion of wildfire-related funding is in-
cluded, and that will go out through 
the Forest Service and the Department 
of the Interior; $2.4 billion for haz-
ardous fuels reduction efforts; $2.1 bil-
lion for efforts to restore ecosystems 
on a broader scale in a fashion that 
will help reduce the vulnerability of 
the forests and other ecosystems to 
fire; $1 billion to help fund wildfire 
mitigation activities for at-risk com-
munities; $650 million for rehabili-
tating areas burned by fires; and $600 
million to give firefighters the pay 
raises they deserve and to increase the 
year-round workforce. 
For years, I have been saying that 
one of the problems we have is a big at-
trition rate for firefighters. They go 
out for a season, and then the job is 
over, and they have to find other jobs. 
When they find those other jobs, well, 
they are not there to fight the fire the 
next season. Crew bosses are essential. 
You don’t want to lose these experi-
enced crew bosses. 
So what is the answer? Well, part of 
the answer is, let’s create year-round 
jobs with decent pay so that when you 
are not doing firefighting directly, you 
are doing fire prevention by working 
on forest management projects, and I 
think that idea is starting to gain 
some traction. 
We also have funding in here to in-
crease the collaborative forest land-
scape 
restoration 
projects, 
CFLR 
projects. A CFLR collaborative brings 
together the stakeholders from every 
perspective—from the environmental 
side, from the timber side, from all 
sides in between—and they work out 
what they refer to as a prescription for 
a specific forest. 
They go out, and in the beginning, 
when they don’t really have a great 
trust relationship, they go out to-
gether, and they will go through the 
acreage and mark the trees. Then later 
on, as the trust grows, they write the 
prescription, and they know it will get 
implemented as they desire, and they 
can get a lot more work done. Do you 
know what? It means this thinning op-
eration, this forest treatment oper-
ation, stays out of the courts. That is 
very important because if we are just 
treating forests through timber sales 
that are always hung up in disputes in 
the courts, we are not getting the job 
done. 
This effort to increase the role of 
these collaboratives puts people in the 
room who have been traditional oppo-
nents. They are talking to each other, 
and they are working out plans to-
gether. They find out they actually 
sometimes like each other. So we need 
a lot more of these collaboratives. 
We have in Oregon close to two dozen 
collaboratives. Only four are federally 
funded. So by increasing the funding, 
we enable more collaboratives to do a 
lot more work, and that would be a 
very good thing. 
I spoke to the billions of dollars, but 
you know what—these couple billion 
dollars is not enough. I will be intro-
ducing legislation modeled on the 
Great American Outdoors Act to fund 
$30 billion in hazardous fuel treatments 
across our public lands over the next 5 
years. That is closer to the scale we 
need to undertake to manage these for-
ests. 
It used to be you thought about, well, 
when do I want to go out and hike on 
the Pacific Crest Trail? Well, August 
has the least chance of rain. Now it is 
like whatever you do, think twice 
about going out in August because you 
will be dodging forest fires. It has hap-
pened to my wife Mary and me a num-
ber of times now. We planned to hike in 
the southern part of the Pacific Crest 
Trail, and twice we had to move to the 
northern part. We hiked in the north-
ern part twice and had to dodge forest 
fires. One time, it was the fire that 
erupted and put the whole Columbia 
Gorge on fire. They had fireworks on 
the Fourth of July. 
Just last year, we were hiking start-
ing on the Warm Springs Reservation, 
and other hikers said: Hey, did you 
know that there is already a fire on the 
Warm 
Springs 
Reservation—right 
where we were. Well, the wind was 
blowing the other way. We hadn’t 
smelled the smoke. You are out of cell 
phone range. You are up in the moun-
tains. We hadn’t heard that. But it re-
flects the fact that you have to worry 
now when hiking because the forest is 
so vulnerable. It is so dry. It so easily 
turns into a fire that can move very 
quickly, especially if there is a wind. 
I have worked to get funding for the 
National Guard to be able to help fight 
fires over the last 4 years, including 
1,500 members of the Oregon National 
Guard who have been trained. They 
have been out helping on this Bootleg 
Fire, so that is great. We have been 
working to enable FEMA to deliver dis-
aster assistance more quickly to the 
communities impacted by catastrophic 
fires. 
And we have sat to recognize that we 
need to tackle the issue of smoke. We 
didn’t used to talk about smoke in Or-
egon, but it was smoke from burning 
our grass seed fields, because the way 
to get grass seed very pure was to burn 
fields every year. So we had this haze

throughout the summer. Well, it was 
very unhelpful to people’s health to be 
breathing that smoke. So eventually 
we said: No, no, no, we are not going to 
burn the fields in that fashion. 
But now we have the smoke from the 
forest fires, and—wouldn’t you know 
it—when I was home last weekend, I 
expected to see a lot of smoke. There 
was a previous moment where I drove 
600 miles during the Labor Day fires 
last year, and I never got out of the 
smoke for 600 miles. This time, I was in 
blue skies. And then I looked and saw 
that the weather patterns were driving 
the smoke from our fires into Montana, 
and it was going up in the jet stream. 
It was swirling around. There was a lot 
of smoke here in DC from the fires out 
West. 
Well, so it is a national issue. In fact, 
I guess the index for air quality in New 
York City surged to 157, and anything 
above 100 is pretty dangerous. But that 
just shows the level of challenge that 
we are addressing. 
So we need to tackle the smoke, and 
that is why I am introducing the 
Smoke-Ready Communities Act and 
the Wildfire Smoke Emergency Dec-
laration Act. We need to recognize the 
threat not just from the fires but also 
the impact of the smoke on commu-
nities. So we need to have a way to re-
spond and create a national emergency 
related to it. We need to prepare our 
communities to be ready for the 
smoke, to have some kind of air-fil-
tered locations where people with asth-
ma and other healthcare conditions 
can escape and get to clean air when 
the air quality drops so dramatically. 
And we need to protect our farm 
workers. So I will be introducing the 
Farmworker Smoke and Heat Protec-
tion Act. We lost one of our farm work-
ers due to heat when this heat dome 
struck Oregon a couple of weeks ago. 
There in Portland, where my house is, 
it was 116 degrees, plus a wind that was 
blowing that turned it into a hairdryer. 
You stepped outside, and you were just 
watching the plants just shrivel up. 
And we were fortunate. We converted 
our gas furnace to a heat pump so that 
we could heat our house with renew-
able electricity rather than fossil fuels. 
The side benefit is we got air-condi-
tioning. So we had air-conditioning for 
the first time. But so many houses in 
Oregon don’t have it. Think about the 
impact of 116-degree heat in a place 
where it is rare to have a single day 
ever break 100 degrees during the sum-
mer. 
So we need Federal standards related 
to smoke. We need to work with the 
Occupational Health and Safety Ad-
ministration to ensure that farm work-
ers get the assistance they need to be 
able to work safely. 
I can’t underscore enough the impor-
tance of us coming together as a nation 
to tackle these western fires. At this 
moment, the fire season is just begin-
ning in Oregon. It feels like we have 
been in it forever. It is just July. We 
have 
August, 
September, 
October. 
Well, we just turned the calendar onto 
August—August, September, October. 
We had fires starting early in the year, 
as early as March, burning late in the 
year. In California, it is a year-round 
proposition already, and Oregon isn’t 
far behind. 
My fervent hope is that with fires en-
gulfing Oregon and California and 
Idaho Montana and others, it will be a 
wake-up call that we need in this 
Chamber to realize that we have a re-
sponsibility to act and to act quickly. 
We have an opportunity to make an 
impact, but we have to have the policy 
knowledge and the political determina-
tion to take that quick action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2133 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
understand Senator CARPER
has al-
ready called up the amendment 2133. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is correct. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak 
on this important bipartisan amend-
ment. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Senators 
LANKFORD, MORAN, ROUNDS, SCHATZ, 
FEINSTEIN, and SMITH for joining me in 
this effort. 
Tribal communities face grave and 
unjust disparities in access to all kinds 
of infrastructure, but the disparities 
and access to healthcare and health in-
frastructure are increasingly stark. 
This amendment is very simple. It is 
common sense, in my opinion. It is a 
technical fix that would allow urban 
Indian organizations to use the Indian 
Health Service funds that they already 
receive for infrastructure and facilities 
improvements. 
So I want to be clear. This amend-
ment would not give urban Indian or-
ganizations more funding or take away 
funding from anybody else. It would 
simply give them additional flexibility 
to use the funding they already receive 
for necessary infrastructure improve-
ments. 
Urban Indian organizations provide 
culturally competent care for over 70 
percent of American Indians and Alas-
ka Natives who live in urban centers. 
Many of those served live in low-in-
come, medically underserved areas. Ac-
cording to recent congressional testi-
mony from the Indian Health Service, 
‘‘expanding the current authority to be 
consistent with the authority for other 
government contractors. . . . would 
allow [urban Indian organizations] to 
make renovations, construction, or ex-
pansion of facilities necessary to im-
prove the safety and quality of care 
provided to urban Indian patients.’’ 
In fact, the Deputy Director of the 
Indian Health Service went on to state: 
Providing [urban Indian organizations] 
with broader authority . . . to improve 
their health care facilities will assist 
in providing the high quality, safe, and 
culturally relevant health care for the 
Urban Indian population.’’ 
This amendment, I believe, is par-
ticularly relevant in the midst of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, when items like 
ventilation, 
along 
with 
social 
distancing and other infrastructure up-
grades, are desperately needed. This is 
an easy, no-cost, bipartisan way to 
help ensure that this package bolsters 
infrastructure in Indian Country, be-
cause no infrastructure package would 
be complete without robust, strategic 
improvements to Tribal infrastructure. 
It has the support of the chairman and 
ranking member of the Indian Affairs 
Committee, which just held a hearing 
on this issue last month, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2162 
Mr. 
TESTER. 
Madam 
President, 
thanks for the recognition. I want to 
start by thanking Senator JOHN THUNE 
on this amendment. He and I cospon-
sored this together. 
There is incredible investment in 
broadband infrastructure in this bill. 
For obvious reasons, the pandemic has 
taught us that we need to have better 
broadband service if we are going to be 
able to have distance learning, if we 
are going to have telehealth, and if we 
are going to have businesses have it 
and give them the opportunities to be 
able to expand their customer base. 
Well, the challenge out there is work-
force, and what this bill will do is it 
will help us better understand how 
many folks are actually going to need 
to be hired to train on this enormous 
endeavor. It will not only help with 
workforce, but it will also help to 
make sure working conditions are safe 
and the folks are fairly compensated 
for a hard day’s work. 
Look, the broadband provisions in 
this bill are landmark and will create 
good-paying jobs not only during the 
building of the infrastructure but also 
well on for decades and decades past. 
We need to make sure every commu-
nity is included and nobody is left be-
hind. This amendment will help us 
achieve those goals. I would encourage 
my colleagues to support it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

for the quorum call be rescinded.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

AMENDMENT NO. 2162 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote in relation to the 
Thune-Tester amendment, No. 2162. 
The Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, amend-
ment No. 2162 would aim to address the 
workforce needs of the telecommuni-
cations industry and increase the num-
ber of workers available to deploy 5G 
technology and broadband services to 
rural areas across the Nation. 
In order to reap the benefits of 5G, we 
must have a skilled workforce in place 
to deploy the infrastructure necessary 
to support this new technology. 
Importantly, 5G technology will re-
quire not just traditional cell phone 
towers, but small antennas called 
small cells that can often be attached 
to existing infrastructure, like utility 
poles or buildings. Wireless providers 
will need to install roughly 800,000 
small cells around the Nation to sup-
port this nationwide 5G network. And 
some estimates suggest we will need an 
additional 20,000 tower climbers alone 
for installation of this wireless infra-
structure. 
In addition, after installation, every 
one of these small cells will have to be 
monitored and maintained, which will 
require a substantial increase in the 
telecommunications workforce. 
This amendment will help identify 
ways in which we can expand the num-
ber of workers enrolled in 5G training 
programs and identify ways to grow 
the 
telecommunications 
workforce 
well into the future. 
This amendment received unanimous 
support by the Commerce Committee 
earlier this year, and I would encour-
age my colleagues here to do the same. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to associate myself with the words of 
JOHN THUNE: Listen to THUNE, vote yes. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2162 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from New Jersey (Mr. BOOKER)

commercial buildings for space heating, 
water heating, cooking, or other purposes; or 
‘‘(2) to compel the adoption of model build-

Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

AMENDMENT NO. 2180 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to address the 
amendment on which we will be voting 
in the next 15 or 20 minutes. It is the 
Barrasso amendment to No. 2137. It has 
to do with building codes in the bill 
that is on the floor tonight for our dis-
cussion and debate, the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
There is money in this bill that is 
being debated today for building codes, 
and this amendment is quite simple. It 
is a consumer protection amendment, 
and it just says no money—no money 
in this bill—can be used to bar natural 
gas hookups to your home. You can’t 
block commercial use, residential use, 
and new constructions. So no money in 
the bill can be used to restrict or pro-
hibit the direct use of natural gas in 
residential and commercial buildings 
in support of it—space heating, water 
heating or cooking, and for other pur-
poses. And you can’t also use money to 
compel the adoption of modern build-
ing energy codes. Those are local deci-
sions that are made. 
Why I come to the floor to speak spe-
cifically about that is that people all 
around the country are very concerned 
about what is in this bill and how it is 
going to affect them at home and how 
they live and their pocketbooks. No 
matter where you are from, people are 
saying: How is this going to impact 
me? 
People who are living under the 
times of this massive inflation that 
they are hitting—they are paying more 
for groceries, they are paying more for 
gasoline, and now they are looking at, 
if they come out with building codes 
that block natural gas hookups, what 
is that going to do to the cost of en-
ergy to heat their home, to cook, and 
all of those sorts of things? 
And for people who are not nec-
essarily tuned into this who may be 
Members of this body but who don’t 
think about how so many of the deci-
sions here impact hard-working Amer-
ican families, I come to a story that 
was in this morning’s Wall Street Jour-
nal. The headline is ‘‘Natural-Gas 
Phaseouts Are Facing Resistance.’’ 
And there is a reason they are facing 
resistance. They are facing resistance 
because people do not want to have to 
pay more money for energy to heat 
their homes, to cook, and all of those 
things. 
And the article points out that Mas-
sachusetts is emerging as a key battle-
ground in this U.S. fight over whether 
to phase out natural gas for home 
cooking and heating, with fears of un-
known costs. That is what people are 
concerned about—unknown costs and 
unfamiliar technologies fueling much 
of the opposition as the country is 
being encouraged to go all electric. 
So what we are seeing is that more 
towns around Boston are debating 
measures to block or limit the use of 
gas in new construction, and they talk 
about climate change as a reason for 
that. Well, builders and realtors will 
tell you that construction costs go up 
and the cost of heating and cooking go 
up if you are not allowed to use natural 
gas in the construction. As a matter of 
fact, a study by a subsidiary of the Na-
tional Association of Home Builders, 
published this year, estimated that 
building all-electric homes in the cold-
er climates of Denver, CO, the Rocky 
Mountain West, and Minneapolis—as 
part of their study, they say it may 
cost at least $11,000 more to build those 
than it would if you could allow them 
to be built for the use of gas. 
So they are saying: Wait a second. 
Before you drive up the cost of buying 
a new home, before you drive up the 
cost of cooking and heating your home, 
let’s let people make some decisions 
for themselves. They don’t need Wash-
ington telling us what we need to do 
and what we can do. 
Major cities right now, including San 
Francisco, Seattle, Denver, and New 
York, have enacted or proposed meas-
ures to ban or discourage the use of 
natural gas in new homes and in build-
ings. This is 2 years after Berkeley, one 
of the most liberal bastions of the 
country, passed the first such prohibi-
tion in the United States. 
And, as you can imagine, when these 
things are coming out of California, a 
State with the highest electricity costs 
in the country, a State with ongoing 
blackouts because of their lack of en-
ergy effectiveness and efficiency and 
all of the mandates related to energy 
and sky-high prices, the efforts have 
sparked 
a 
backlash—no 
surprise— 
prompting some States to make gas 
bans illegal. 
So I am coming to the floor with this 
amendment to point out that, as we 
are working on bipartisan legislation 
and there is money in the bill for build-
ing codes, no money can be used to pro-
hibit natural gas hookups to homes, 
commercial construction, residential, 
and new construction, because con-
sumers have to have a say in this. 
It shouldn’t be government saying: 
We know better than you do. We will 
spend your money. We will make deci-
sions about how you get to spend your 
hard-earned money. 
And it is coming from the State of 
Wyoming where a significant produc-
tion of natural gas is affordable, reli-
able, available, and people want to use 
it. They want to use it because they 
know the value to them and their fami-
lies and their way of life. They don’t 
want Washington coming in and say-
ing: No, you can’t do it because we 
know better than you do. 
And I hear a lot about that at home 
in Wyoming—people saying to Wash-
ington: You don’t know better than we 
do. We don’t need you telling us. 
The bill doesn’t say that it is going 
to tell them. We just want to make 
sure that by adopting this amendment, 
the building codes do not bar the use of 
natural gas hookups to your home. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2180 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
rise to urge my colleagues to vote 
against this Barrasso amendment be-
cause there is nothing in the under-
lying provision that would in any way 
promote prohibiting natural gas, and 
that is what Senator BARRASSO is sug-
gesting is in the bill. 
Now, if it were such as Senator BAR-
RASSO says, I don’t think we would 
have received strong letters of support 
for this specific provision from both 
the National Association of Home 
Builders and the American Gas Asso-
ciation. 
I have the letters right here. I would 
actually like to read from the Home 
Builders’ letter. 
The Home Builders support section 
5101, which was the original section in 
the Energy bill as it passed the com-
mittee. 
Cost-Effective codes implementation for 
efficiency and resiliency. 
And this is the important point: 
This section promotes technical assistance 
and funding for code adoption while main-
taining the flexibility for state and local 
governments to deliver safe, energy efficient, 
and affordable housing. 
Why would we want to get in the way 
of what States and communities are al-
ready doing? 
I ask unanimous consent that both of 
these letters be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

efforts to increase energy efficiency and re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions without strin-
gent energy code mandates that will increase 
housing prices for American home buyers. 
NAHB strongly supports climate change 
programs that recognize and promote vol-
untary, above-code compliance for energy ef-
ficiency programs. There are several pro-
grams, certifications, and other options that 
are incorporated into this legislation that 
promote verifiable reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions. Specifically, NAHB supports 
Section 5101, Cost-effective codes implemen-
tation for efficiency and resiliency. This sec-
tion promotes technical assistance and fund-
ing for code adoption while maintaining the 
flexibility for state and local governments to 
deliver safe, energy efficient, and affordable 
housing. 
We commend your leadership on this vital 
legislation and look forward to working as a 
partner with all levels of government to en-
courage energy efficiency. 
Thank you for your consideration on this 
matter.

JAMES W. TOBIN III. 
AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION,

Hon. JOE MANCHIN III, 
Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JOHN BARRASSO, 
Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
MANCHIN
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER BARRASSO: On behalf of the Amer-
ican Gas Association (AGA), we appreciate 
your Committee’s consideration of the legis-
lative proposal to address energy infrastruc-
ture throughout the country—the Energy In-
frastructure Act. AGA is committed to re-
ducing greenhouse gas emissions through 
smart innovation, new and modernized infra-
structure, and advanced natural gas tech-
nologies that maintain reliable, resilient, 
and affordable energy service choices for 
consumers. With these principles in mind, we 
are pleased to support Subtitle B—Hydrogen 
Research and Development, Section 5002— 
Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Cap-
italization Grant Program, and Section 
5101—Cost-Effective Codes Implementation 
for Efficiency and Resilience within the En-
ergy Infrastructure Act. 
AGA, founded in 1918, represents more than 
200 local energy companies that deliver clean 
natural gas throughout the United States. 
Nearly 180 million Americans and 5.5 million 
businesses use natural gas in all fifty states 
utilize natural gas served by an infrastruc-
ture base that is unrivaled in the world. 
The use of natural gas, in combination 
with energy efficiency and renewable gases— 
such as hydrogen—has contributed to U.S. 
energy-related carbon dioxide emissions de-
clining to the lowest levels in three decades. 
Furthermore, methane emissions from nat-
ural gas utility distribution systems have 
declined 73 percent since 1990, even as nat-
ural gas utility companies added more than 
760,000 miles of pipeline and approximately a 
customer every minute. 
We appreciate the work your Committee is 
doing to advance legislation that would put 
in place fuel neutral approaches to address-
ing the country’s energy infrastructure 
needs. The natural gas industry has a proven 
track record of reducing emissions through 
energy efficiency and innovation, and we 
look forward to continuing to work with you 
on these important issues. 
Sincerely, 
GEORGE LOWE. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. As many of my col-
leagues know, it is unprecedented to 
get the American Gas Association, the 
National Association of Home Builders, 
and the energy efficiency advocates all 
in agreement, and that is the result of 
the extensive negotiations that went 
into this section of the bill that Sen-
ator BARRASSO would overturn. 
Now, 
Energy 
Chairman 
MANCHIN 
wasn’t able to get here to speak to this 
provision and this amendment, but he 
opposes it. And if he were here, he 
would say: ‘‘Let’s not mess with a good 
thing.’’ 
This provision doesn’t ban—it doesn’t 
even touch natural gas. So I strongly 
support the bill as written and urge my 
colleagues to vote no on this amend-
ment. 
I yield the floor. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the vote that is scheduled 
begin immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Seeing none, without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2

TRIBUTE TO KEITH AND LINDA 
HAMILTON 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at 
the 109th Wyoming State Fair, Senator 
LUMMIS and I will have the pleasure of 
introducing Keith and Linda Hamilton 
as 2021 inductees to the Wyoming Agri-
culture Hall of Fame. 
Growing up as the fourth generation 
on the Hamilton Ranch, Keith’s agri-
cultural involvement holds deep roots 
in working to advance agricultural 
leadership and conserve natural re-
sources important to the western life-
style. In 1975, Keith joined the Wyo-
ming Farm Bureau and began taking 
on leadership positions in 1981 as the 
Big Horn County Farm Bureau vice 
president. In 1988, Keith joined the Wy-
oming Farm Bureau Federation board 
of directors and represented Big Horn, 
Fremont, 
Hot 
Springs, 
Park, 
and 
Washakie Counties as the northwest 
district director until 2010. 
In addition to serving the agricul-
tural community through the Wyo-
ming Farm Bureau, Keith has been 
very active in serving on public lands 
boards, wildlife working groups, and 
livestock 
organizations. 
Keith 
has 
given his time to the Big Horn Basin 
Sage Grouse Working Group, the Big 
Horn County Predator Management 
Board, and is the past chairman of the 
Wyoming 
State 
Grazing 
Board. 
Through his work, the wildlife of Wyo-
ming is left more abundant for future 
generations. 
As Mark Anderson, current chairman 
of the Wyoming State Grazing Board 
observed, ‘‘Keith is currently our val-
ued representative on the Wyoming 
Board of Directors to the National 
Public Lands Council and he is the 
type of person I would like to have as 
a neighbor.’’ 
The 
Hamilton 
Ranch 
and 
Keith 
would not be as successful as it is 
today were it not for his wife, Linda. 
Linda has a servant’s heart and has 
dedicated her time and efforts to many 
events and organizations within the 
Hyattville community. She served as a 
founding member of Wyoming Agri-
culture in the Classroom as well as on 
their board of directors. She has also 
served on the board of directors for 
Northwest 
College 
alumni, 
the 
Hyattville Methodist Church, and the 
Wyoming Association of Conservation 
District. Linda held the important role 
as a spokesperson for conservation dis-
tricts in both State government and 
the legislature. Linda leads with a self-
less volunteerism, a community-based 
spirit, and an outstanding work ethic. 
In addition to their involvement in 
civic activities, Keith and Linda Ham-
ilton’s love and dedication for agri-
culture show both in their dedication 
to organizations, as well as in the im-
provement 
of 
operations 
on 
their 
ranch. The Hamilton Ranch was recog-
nized as the 1998 Environmental Stew-
ardship Award winner, as well as a Wy-
oming Centennial Ranch in 2015. Both 
of these reflect the nature of Keith and 
Linda as leaders in agriculture. 
The Hamiltons were one of four oper-
ations to initially enroll in the Wyo-
ming Stewardship Program in 1982. 
This program opened the door for the 
Hamiltons to work closely with agen-
cies such as Wyoming Game and Fish 
Department, Wyoming Department of 
Agriculture, Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, U.S. Forest Service, and Natural 
Resources Conservation Service on im-
proving ranch operations. The Ham-
ilton Ranch continues their involve-
ment with these agencies today, lead-
ing the way for agricultural innovation 
and collaboration in Wyoming. 
Keith and Linda are longtime mem-
bers of the Wyoming Wool Growers As-
sociation, Wyoming Stock Growers As-
sociation, and past members of the 
Mountain States Lamb Co-op. 
With the Hamilton family’s unwaver-
ing commitment to our State, it is 
with great honor to induct them into 
the 
Wyoming 
Agriculture 
Hall 
of 
Fame. Keith and Linda Hamilton rep-
resent the best of Wyoming courage, 
optimism, and the Western Code. They 
have represented Wyoming’s interests 
with dedication and distinction for 
many years. My wife, Bobbi, joins me 
in congratulating Keith and Linda 
Hamilton as 2021 inductees into the 
Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JIM LOGAN 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, today I 
am honored to recognize my good 
friend Dr. Jim Logan, who is being in-
ducted into the Wyoming Agriculture 
Hall of Fame. Since the Wyoming Agri-
culture Hall of Fame was established in 
1992, 67 agriculture leaders have been 
recognized for their substantial con-
tributions to our great State. I speak 
for many when I say Dr. Logan is more 
than deserving of this distinguished 
honor. He built an outstanding career 
in Wyoming and has risen to the high-
est ranks of his profession. Beyond his 
professional success, he exemplifies 
what it means to be an outstanding 
Wyoming citizen. 
Dr. Logan began his studies at the 
University of Wyoming in 1969 and con-
tinued his education at Colorado State 
University earning his doctor of veteri-
nary medicine degree. Upon gradua-
tion, he returned home to Riverton, 
WY, and joined a veterinary medicine 
practice. He later opened his own prac-
tice, and for over 40 years, he gra-
ciously served his community. During 
that time, he established a strong rep-
utation among Wyoming’s farmers and 
ranchers. He quickly excelled and be-
came a reputable leader in his profes-
sion. 
After developing extensive knowl-
edge and expertise in his field, he gen-
erously offered many years of service 
to the State of Wyoming. Dr. Logan 
served the Wyoming Livestock Board 
in many capacities, including as the 
State veterinarian. The agriculture 
community in Wyoming is grateful for 
Dr. Logan’s contributions and his com-
mitment to health and safety for an in-
dustry that makes up the very fabric of 
Wyoming culture. 
As a member of various working 
groups 
and 
regulatory 
boards, 
he 
helped address some of the most press-
ing issues affecting our State. He was a 
central figure in the development of 
Wyoming Brucellosis Designated Sur-
veillance Area regulations. With any 
decision, he constantly kept the best 
interest of Wyoming’s livestock pro-
ducers in mind. For this, we are thank-
ful. 
I would also like to mention that Dr. 
Logan has exceeded all expectations in 
what it means to be a leader in the 
community. His passion for agriculture 
has inspired the next generation of 
farmers and ranchers. Dr. Logan is a 
proud supporter of 4–H and FFA, serv-
ing as a mentor and instructor to 
young people with a heart for agri-
culture. He has also taken on many 
other leadership responsibilities on 
several State and national industry as-
sociations and committees, including 
the American Veterinary Medical Asso-
ciation, American Sheep Industry As-
sociation, and the Western States Live-
stock Health Association. Outside of 
the agriculture industry, he served as 
the chairman of the Riverton Memorial 
Hospital Board.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5560 
August 2, 2021 
Earlier this year, Dr. Logan an-
nounced his retirement as the Wyo-
ming State veterinarian. While his re-
tirement is a true loss for farmers and 
ranchers across the State, no one is 
more deserving of a happy and joyful 
retirement. I want to offer my deepest 
congratulations on a successful career. 
It is my privilege to recognize Dr. 
Logan’s achievements and honor his in-
duction to the Wyoming Agriculture 
Hall of Fame. Wyoming is grateful for 
his decades of service and respect the 
personal sacrifices that were made for 
the State. 
Dr. Logan, your contributions and 
dedication will always be remembered. 
As you start your retirement, you can 
be proud of the work you have done, 
but also know that you still have a 
long ride to enjoy. Happy Trails.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION HEALTH LAW SEC-
TION 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, in 1996, 
the health law section of the American 
Bar Association was created to en-
hance the practice of health law and 
improve the understanding and devel-
opment of Federal and State health 
laws and regulations. The members of 
the ABA health law section represent 
all aspects of the healthcare and life 
sciences industry, comprising a diverse 
group of lawyers in the private sector, 
government service, and academia. The 
health law section provides thought 
leadership on all issues within the 
healthcare industry and advocates for 
sound public policy. In addition, its 
members have played prominent roles 
in developing programs to train advo-
cates for victims of breast cancer, in 
providing pro bono legal services to in-
dividuals through medical-legal part-
nerships, and in seeking improvements 
in the delivery of mental healthcare 
and treatment of substance use dis-
orders. 
I ask that the Senate recognize the 
tremendous accomplishments and con-
tributions of the members of the Amer-
ican Bar Association health law sec-
tion and extend its best wishes for 
many years of continued service to the 
healthcare and life sciences industry.∑

TRIBUTE TO BUD OLSON 
∑
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Bud Olson of Teton County as Mon-
tanan of the Month for his service to 
our country during World War II. 
Bud was a member of the 82nd 
Airborne’s 325th Glider Infantry Regi-
ment, which participated in Operation 
Overlord, better known as D-Day. Dur-
ing that fateful operation, the 325th 
Glider Infantry Regiment sustained 
many crash landings, including Bud’s 
glider. 
Bud was the sole survivor after his 
glider crash landed. Following this 
tragic event, Bud went on to help se-
cure the bridge in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, 
which was the first village in France to 
be liberated by the Allies. Bud contin-
ued his service in campaigns through-
out France, Holland, and Belgium and 
took part in the liberation of the 
Wobbelin concentration camp. 
Military service has always had an 
influence on Bud. He is a 60-year mem-
ber of the Choteau American Legion. 
For many years, Bud had ‘‘D Day 44’’ 
on the license plate of his car. 
After the war, Bud returned to Teton 
County where he and his wife, Vi, 
worked the family’s ranch outside of 
Choteau and has been an active mem-
ber of his community. He served as a 
Teton County commissioner for 15 
years, from 1965 to 1980. Bud has been 
an avid supporter of Choteau School 
District’s athletics program, attending 
games in town and even traveling to 
cheer on his beloved Bulldogs. 
Bud celebrated his 100th birthday on 
July 29, 2021. In celebration, Choteau 
Mayor Chris Hindoein declared it ‘‘Bud 
Olson Day.’’ Residents were encouraged 
to fly flags in honor of Bud and to wear 
maroon and gold acknowledging his 
support of the Bulldogs. 
Bud epitomizes the heart of a vet-
eran—a Montana hero—whose selfless 
service will not be forgotten. On behalf 
of a grateful nation, I want to thank 
Bud for his service to our country, and 
I wish him a very happy 100th birth-
day.∑

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SLCC 
MEN’S 
SOCCER 
NATIONAL 
CHAMPION-
SHIP VICTORY 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the incredible ath-
letic achievements of the Salt Lake 
Community College men’s soccer pro-
gram. This past season, their hard 
work 
and 
collective 
determination 
earned them the NJCAA Division One 
national championship title following 
a thrilling overtime victory in the 
final match. 
The Salt Lake Bruins accomplished 
this feat after an undefeated con-
ference season, tallying an ultimate 
record of 16–1-1 under the impressive 
leadership of Mark Davis and the en-
tire coaching staff. On their path to 
the final, the Bruins were crowned 
champions of Region 18, West District, 
and the Scenic West Conference. 
On June 10, 2021, Davis and his tal-
ented squad of young athletes, a union 
of Utahns and international footballers 
proudly representing the Bruins ban-
ner, faced top ranked Iowa Western in 
the final. Despite conceding early, the 
Bruins clawed back thanks to a sensa-
tional left-footed strike by Ryen Jiba. 
In overtime, Paul Richnow headed 
home the game winner to deliver the 
program its first ever championship 
trophy. 
Champions are forged by years of su-
preme dedication to individual and col-
lective improvement on and off the 
pitch. These athletes of diverse back-
grounds demonstrated their ability to 
excel as one team, and they should be 
immensely proud of their accomplish-
ment. For their efforts, Bruins players 
and coaches earned numerous acco-
lades, including Mark Davis being 
named SWAC and West District Coach 
of the Year, as well as Coach of the 
Tournament. His staff, including Cassie 
Ulrich, 
Ty 
O’Connor, 
and 
Jordan 
Carver, earned United Soccer Coaches 
Staff of the Year and four All Amer-
ican selections. Sophomores Levonte 
Johnson, Samuel Owusu, and Paul 
Richnow were named NJCAA First 
Team All Americans, and Richnow also 
earned MVP of the National Tour-
nament. An additional 12 players have 
committed to playing at the NCAA 
level. 
Individual performances and acco-
lades are built on the strong founda-
tion of a great team. Recently crowned 
champions also include freshman Jose 
Arellano, Christian Olivares, Daniel 
Tareke, 
Mason 
McRae, 
Taimu 
Okiyoshi, Jermaine Muirhead, Sergio 
Martinez, 
William 
Greener, 
Negue 
Kante, Santiago Delfino, Ethan Cole-
man, Hogeun Jee, Kai Phillip, and 
Samson Ahisu. Sophomores also in-
clude Omar Gomez, Freddy Cano, Bran-
don Cervantes, Jason Chavez, Andres 
Bermudez, Azriel Johnson, Johnathan 
Castro, and Rafael Calderon. 
I extend my congratulations to the 
entire SLCC men’s soccer program for 
their historic season and wish them the 
best of luck in their continued athletic 
and academic pursuits.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROGER BEGIN 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize a constituent 
and friend, Roger Begin. Roger serves 
as the Honorary Consul of France in 
Providence. In September, the French 
Government will award him the Legion 
of Honor, the country’s highest order 
of merit, for his long and distinguished 
career in public service. I congratulate 
Roger on earning this recognition and 
thank him for his many contributions 
to civic life in Rhode Island. 
As the Honorary Consul of France, 
Roger is a liaison to the French Gov-
ernment and helps Rhode Islanders 
with passports, immigration, and other 
government business. Roger previously 
had a lengthy and productive career in 
public service. A son of Woonsocket 
and graduate of CCRI and Bryant Uni-
versity, he was elected to the Rhode Is-
land House of Representatives at the 
age of 19. After serving several terms, 
he went on to win election as Rhode Is-
land’s general treasurer and then Lieu-
tenant Governor. 
I served as legal counsel to Governor 
Bruce 
Sundlun 
during 
tumultuous 
years of crisis and reform, while Roger 
was Lieutenant Governor. Serving in 
government in times of crisis is a bond-
ing experience. 
Outside of his time in government, 
Roger has served on the boards of 
many mission-driven organizations in 
our community. From the Meeting

Opportunity Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. lll02. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Driving a vehicle is an essential aspect 
of the daily lives of most people in the 
United States. 
(2) Driving is often required to access jobs 
and healthcare, take care of family, get gro-
ceries, and fulfill other basic responsibilities. 
(3) In many small cities, towns, and rural 
areas that do not have public transportation 
and ridesharing alternatives, driving is often 
the only realistic means of transportation. 
(4) Even in cities with public transpor-
tation and ridesharing options, individuals 
vulnerable to infection during the COVID–19 
pandemic and those complying with public 
health guidance regarding social distancing 
are increasingly reliant on driving as their 
primary means of transportation for essen-
tial travel. 
(5) In the United States, millions of Ameri-
cans have had their driver’s licenses sus-
pended for unpaid court fines and fees. 
(6) A person whose driver’s license is sus-
pended or revoked for unpaid fines and fees 
will often find it more difficult to earn a liv-
ing and therefore pay the debt owed to the 
government. 
(7) The barrier to employment posed by 
driver’s license suspensions and revocations 
for unpaid fines and fees is especially prob-
lematic during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
when the unemployment rate is the highest 
it has been since the Great Depression. 
(8) Drunk and dangerous driving are some 
of the leading causes of death and serious 
bodily injury in the United States, and pro-
moting safety on the roads is a legitimate, 
necessary, and core governmental function. 
Suspending a license for unsafe driving con-
duct presents different considerations than 
suspending a license for unpaid fines and 
fees. Suspending a license for unsafe driving 
is an appropriate tool to protect public safe-
ty. Policymakers also may consider alter-
natives to suspension of a license for unsafe 
driving such as ignition interlock device pro-
grams. 
(9) According to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, every year on 
average, over 34,000 people are killed and 
2,400,000 more people are injured in motor ve-
hicle crashes. Some of the major causes of 
these crashes include speeding, impaired 
driving, and distracted driving. Nearly half 
of passenger vehicle occupants killed in 
crashes are unrestrained. The societal harm 
caused by motor vehicle crashes has been 
valued at $836,000,000,000 annually. The en-
actment of, enforcement of, and education 
regarding traffic laws are key to addressing 
unsafe behavior and promoting public safety. 
(10) However, most driver’s license suspen-
sions are not based on the need to protect 
public safety. 
(11) In the State of Florida, 1,100,000 resi-
dents received a suspension notice for unpaid 
fines and fees in 2017 alone. 
(12) Between 2010 and 2017, all but 3 States 
increased the amount of fines and fees for 
civil and criminal violations. 
(13) In the United States, 40 percent of all 
driver’s license suspensions are issued for 
conduct that was unrelated to driving. 
(14) In 2015, the State of Washington cal-
culated that State troopers spent 70,848 
hours dealing with license suspensions for 
non-driving offenses. 
(15) The American Association of Motor 
Vehicle Administrators estimated that ar-
resting a person for driving with a suspended 
license can take 9 hours of an officer’s time, 
including waiting for a tow truck, trans-
porting an individual to jail, filling out pa-
perwork, making a court appearance, and 
other administrative duties and accordingly 
Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste 
called non-driving suspensions a ‘‘drain on 
the system as a whole’’. 
(16) The Colorado Department of Motor Ve-
hicles determined that suspending driver’s 
licenses for offenses unrelated to driving 
consumed 8,566 hours per year of staff time 
in the Department. 
(17) Many States impose a significant fee 
for reinstating a suspended driver’s license, 
such as Alabama, where the fee is $275. 
(18) Driving on a suspended license is one 
of the most common criminal charges in ju-
risdictions across the country. 
(19) Seventy-five percent of those with sus-
pended licenses report continuing to drive.

(20) It is more likely that those people are 
also driving without insurance due to the 
costs and restrictions associated with ob-
taining auto insurance on a suspended li-
cense, thereby placing a greater financial 
burden on other drivers when a driver with a 
suspended license causes an accident. 
(21) The American Association of Motor 
Vehicle Administrators has concluded the 
following: ‘‘Drivers who have been suspended 
for social non-conformance-related offenses 
are often trapped within the system. Some 
cannot afford to pay the original fines, and 
may lose their ability to legally get to and 
from work as a result of the suspension. 
Many make the decision to drive while sus-
pended. The suspension results in increased 
financial obligations through new require-
ments such as reinstatement fees, court 
costs, and other penalties. While there is a 
clear societal interest in keeping those who 
are unfit to drive off the roads, broadly re-
stricting licenses for violations unrelated to 
an individual’s ability to drive safely may do 
more harm than good. This is especially true 
in areas of the country that lack alternative 
means of transportation. For those individ-
uals, a valid driver license can be a means to 
survive. Local communities, employers, and 
employees 
all 
experience 
negative 
con-
sequences as a result of social non-con-
formity suspensions, including unemploy-
ment, lower wages, fewer employment oppor-
tunities and hiring choices, and increased in-
surance costs.’’. 
(22) A report by the Harvard Law School 
Criminal Justice Policy Program concluded 
the following: ‘‘The suspension of a driver’s 
or professional license is one of the most per-
vasive poverty traps for poor people assessed 
a fine that they cannot afford to pay. The 
practice is widespread. Nearly 40 percent of 
license suspensions nationwide stem from 
unpaid fines, missed child support payments, 
and drug offenses—not from unsafe or intoxi-
cated driving or failing to obtain automotive 
insurance. Suspension of a driver’s or profes-
sional licenses is hugely counterproductive; 
it punishes non-payment by taking away a 
person’s means for making a living. License 
suspension programs are also expensive for 
States to run and they distract law enforce-
ment efforts from priorities related to public 
safety. License suspensions may also be un-
constitutional if the license was suspended 
before the judge determined the defendant 
had the ability to pay the criminal justice 
debt.’’.

(a) FINDINGS; PURPOSE.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(A) sudden increases in funding for pur-
chases of federally owned capital assets are 
difficult to fit within funding available 
under discretionary spending limits; 
(B) failure to recapitalize or replace Fed-
eral capital assets on a regular schedule ulti-
mately increases the cost to taxpayers of de-
livering services; 
(C) in appendix J, entitled ‘‘Principles of 
Budgeting for Capital Asset Acquisitions’’, of 
Circular A–11, the Office of Management and 
Budget recommended combining assets in 
capital acquisition accounts to accommo-
date spikes in funding capital acquisitions; 
(D) in the document entitled ‘‘Budgeting 
for Federal Investment’’ and dated April 15, 
2021, the Congressional Budget Office states 
that there is, ‘‘a budgetary incentive to opt 
for short-term leases even if they are more 
expensive than long-term leases or pur-
chases,’’ and identifies a Federal Capital Re-
volving Fund as a potential solution; and

(i) shall remain available until expended; 
(ii) shall be used solely to pay the costs of 
an eligible agency project; and 
(iii) may not be transferred or repro-
grammed for any other purpose. 
(B) RETURN OF UNUSED AMOUNTS.—Any por-
tion of a purchase transfer that is not nec-
essary to pay for the total cost of an eligible 
agency project shall be returned to the Fund, 
as follows: 
(i) 
TIMING.—Any 
unobligated 
purchase 
transfer amounts shall be returned to the 
Fund— 
(I) after the relevant eligible agency 
project is substantially complete, as deter-
mined by the applicable purchasing agency; 
and 
(II) by not later than 2 years after the date 
on which the most recent outlay of funds 
from the purchase transfer by the purchasing 
agency occurred. 
(ii) UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS.—If, after the re-
turn of unused purchase transfer amounts 
under clause (i), there occurs an upward ad-
justment to a previously incurred obligation 
for the eligible agency project, the Fund 
shall provide to the applicable purchasing 
agency an expenditure transfer for the up-
ward adjustment in an amount equal to the 
lower of— 
(I) the amount returned under clause (i); 
and 
(II) the amount of the upward adjustment 
to the previously incurred obligation. 
(6) LIMITATIONS.— 
(A) AVAILABILITY
OF
AMOUNTS.—Notwith-
standing any appropriations Act making 
amounts available for a purchase transfer 
under this subsection, if the amount made 
available to the applicable purchasing agen-
cy for the first repayment amount relating 
to the purchase transfer is less than the 
amount required by subsection (e)(2) for the 
fiscal year, the amount transferred from the 
Fund to the purchasing agency shall be equal 
to the product obtained by multiplying— 
(i) that first repayment amount; and 
(ii) the number of years in the applicable 
repayment period under subsection (e)(3). 
(B) ANNUAL MAXIMUM.—The total amount 
appropriated for a fiscal year for new pur-
chase transfers under this subsection shall 
be not more than an amount equal to the 
sum of— 
(i) $2,500,000,000; and 
(ii) the total amount, if any, by which the 
amounts appropriated for purchase transfers 
during any preceding fiscal years were less 
than the amount described in clause (i). 
(C) HIGHER PROJECT COSTS.—If the amount 
appropriated from the Fund for a purchase 
transfer under this subsection is insufficient 
to pay the full costs of the eligible agency 
project that is the subject of the purchase 
transfer, an amount in excess of the appro-
priated amount may be transferred from the 
Fund to the applicable purchasing agency 
only if— 
(i) the additional transfer is approved in 
advance by an appropriations Act; and 
(ii) the purchasing agency has— 
(I) received an appropriation of an addi-
tional amount for the adjustment to the re-
payment amount under subsection (e)(2)(B); 
and

(D) EFFECT
OF
SUBSECTION.—Nothing in 
this subsection requires any unaffected agen-
cy to receive approval from the Adminis-
trator, or to achieve compliance with section 
3307 of title 40, United States Code, before ac-
quiring real property pursuant to an existing 
authority of the unaffected agency for pur-
poses of this section. 
(7) EXCESS PURCHASE TRANSFER AMOUNTS.— 
In any fiscal year during which the total 
amount of purchase transfers approved to be 
appropriated from the Fund exceeds an 
amount equal to the lesser of the amount 
available in the Fund and the annual limita-
tion described in paragraph (6)(B) for that 
fiscal year— 
(A) each purchase transfer approved by an 
appropriations Act for the fiscal year shall 
be reduced by a uniform percentage, to be 
calculated by the Administrator in a manner 
that ensures that the excess is eliminated; 
and 
(B) the Administrator may not transfer 
from the Fund an amount equal to more 
than the reduced purchase transfer amount 
calculated under subparagraph (A). 
(8) ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.—On receipt of a 
purchase transfer, a purchasing agency shall 
pay to the Administrator from the purchase 
transfer a 1-time administrative fee in an 
amount equal to not less than 0.03 percent of 
the total cost of the eligible agency project 
that is the subject of the purchase transfer. 
(e) REPAYMENTS TO FUND.— 
(1) AGREEMENT REQUIRED.—As a condition 
of receiving a purchase transfer from the 
Fund, a purchasing agency shall enter into a 
written agreement with the Administrator 
under which the purchasing agency shall 
agree to make annual repayments to the 
Fund in accordance with this subsection. 
(2) AMOUNT.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), the amount of an annual repayment to 
the Fund by a purchasing agency under this 
subsection shall be an amount equal to the

provided to the purchasing agency; by 
(ii) the number of years in the repayment 
period, as determined under paragraph (3). 
(B) ADJUSTMENT.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—In any case described in 
clause (ii), after a purchasing agency repays 
to the Fund the applicable repayment 
amount, the Administrator shall adjust the 
repayment amount owed by the purchasing 
agency for each fiscal year thereafter by 
such uniform amount as the Administrator 
determines to be necessary to ensure that 
the sum of all repayments (including any re-
payments already paid to the Fund) by the 
purchasing agency is equal to the actual cost 
of the eligible agency project of the pur-
chasing agency. 
(ii) DESCRIPTION.—A case referred to in 
clause (i) is any case in which— 
(I) the actual cost of the eligible agency 
project of the purchasing agency is less than 
the purchase transfer to the purchasing 
agency; 
(II)(aa) the actual cost of the eligible agen-
cy project of the purchasing agency is great-
er than the purchase transfer to the pur-
chasing agency; and 
(bb) an additional purchase transfer in an 
amount equal to the amount of the dif-
ference has been approved in advance in an 
appropriations Act; 
(III) the total amount of repayments by

payment amount described in subparagraph 
(A); or

amount is appropriated to the purchasing 
agency pursuant to paragraph (5)(A).

under this subsection not less frequently 
than annually during the period described in 
paragraph (3).

be appropriated to each purchasing agency 
such sums as are necessary for the repay-
ments owed by the purchasing agency to the 
Fund under this subsection for each fiscal 
year during the period— 
(i) beginning in the first fiscal year during 
which amounts are transferred from the 
Fund to the purchasing agency under sub-
section (d)(3)(C); and 
(ii) ending on the last day of the repay-
ment period determined for the purchasing 
agency under paragraph (3). 
(B) TREATMENT.—The receipt by a pur-
chasing agency of amounts made available 
pursuant to subparagraph (A) for a fiscal 
year shall be considered to be a legal obliga-
tion of the purchasing agency during that 
fiscal year to make a repayment to the Fund 
in accordance with this subsection.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the objective of the Federal highway 
program has been to facilitate the construc-
tion of a modern freeway system that pro-
motes efficient interstate commerce by con-
necting all States; 
(2) the objective described in paragraph (1) 
has been attained, and the Interstate System 
connecting all States is near completion; 
(3) each State has the responsibility of pro-
viding an efficient transportation network 
for the residents of the State; 
(4) each State has the means to build and 
operate a network of transportation sys-
tems, including highways, that best serves 
the needs of the State; 
(5) each State is best capable of deter-
mining the needs of the State and acting on 
those needs; 
(6) the Federal role in highway transpor-
tation has, over time, usurped the role of the 
States by taxing motor fuels used in the 
States and then distributing the proceeds to 
the States based on the perceptions of the 
Federal Government on what is best for the 
States; 
(7) the Federal Government has used the 
Federal motor fuels tax revenues to force all 
States to take actions that are not nec-
essarily appropriate for individual States; 
(8) the Federal distribution, review, and 
enforcement process wastes billions of dol-
lars on unproductive activities; 
(9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly 
to all 50 States, regardless of the different 
circumstances of the States, cause the 
States to waste billions of hard-earned tax 
dollars on projects, programs, and activities 
that the States would not otherwise under-
take; and 
(10) Congress has expressed a strong inter-
est in reducing the role of the Federal Gov-
ernment by allowing each State to manage 
its own affairs. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to provide a new policy blueprint to 
govern the Federal role in transportation 
once existing and prior financial obligations 
are met; 
(2) to return to the individual States max-
imum discretionary authority and fiscal re-
sponsibility for all elements of the national 
surface transportation systems that are not 
within the direct purview of the Federal 
Government; 
(3) to preserve Federal responsibility for 
the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System 
of Interstate and Defense Highways; 
(4) to preserve the responsibility of the De-
partment of Transportation for— 
(A) design, construction, and preservation 
of transportation facilities on Federal public 
land; 
(B) national programs of transportation re-
search and development and transportation 
safety; and 
(C) emergency assistance to the States in 
response to natural disasters; 
(5) to eliminate to the maximum extent 
practicable Federal obstacles to the ability 
of each State to apply innovative solutions 
to the financing, design, construction, oper-
ation, and preservation of Federal and State 
transportation facilities; and 
(6) with respect to transportation activi-
ties carried out by States, local govern-
ments, and the private sector, to encour-
age— 
(A) competition among States, local gov-
ernments, and the private sector; and 
(B) innovation, energy efficiency, private 
sector participation, and productivity.

TITLE IV—MISCELLANEOUS 
Sec. 401. National Environmental Policy Act 
modifications. 
Sec. 402. Repeal of Davis-Bacon wage re-
quirements. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the objective of the Federal highway 
program has been to facilitate the construc-
tion of a modern freeway system that pro-
motes efficient interstate commerce by con-
necting all States; 
(2) the objective described in paragraph (1) 
has been attained, and the Interstate System 
connecting all States is near completion; 
(3) each State has the responsibility of pro-
viding an efficient transportation network 
for the residents of the State; 
(4) each State has the means to build and 
operate a network of transportation sys-
tems, including highways, that best serves 
the needs of the State; 
(5) each State is best capable of deter-
mining the needs of the State and acting on 
those needs; 
(6) the Federal role in highway transpor-
tation has, over time, usurped the role of the 
States by taxing motor fuels used in the 
States and then distributing the proceeds to 
the States based on the perceptions of the 
Federal Government on what is best for the 
States; 
(7) the Federal Government has used the 
Federal motor fuels tax revenues to force all 
States to take actions that are not nec-
essarily appropriate for individual States; 
(8) the Federal distribution, review, and 
enforcement process wastes billions of dol-
lars on unproductive activities; 
(9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly 
to all 50 States, regardless of the different 
circumstances of the States, cause the 
States to waste billions of hard-earned tax 
dollars on projects, programs, and activities 
that the States would not otherwise under-
take; and 
(10) Congress has expressed a strong inter-
est in reducing the role of the Federal Gov-
ernment by allowing each State to manage 
its own affairs. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to provide a new policy blueprint to 
govern the Federal role in transportation 
once existing and prior financial obligations 
are met; 
(2) to return to the individual States max-
imum discretionary authority and fiscal re-
sponsibility for all elements of the national 
surface transportation systems that are not 
within the direct purview of the Federal 
Government; 
(3) to preserve Federal responsibility for 
the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System 
of Interstate and Defense Highways; 
(4) to preserve the responsibility of the De-
partment of Transportation for— 
(A) design, construction, and preservation 
of transportation facilities on Federal public 
land; 
(B) national programs of transportation re-
search and development and transportation 
safety; and 
(C) emergency assistance to the States in 
response to natural disasters; 
(5) to eliminate to the maximum extent 
practicable Federal obstacles to the ability 
of each State to apply innovative solutions 
to the financing, design, construction, oper-
ation, and preservation of Federal and State 
transportation facilities; and 
(6) with respect to transportation activi-
ties carried out by States, local govern-
ments, and the private sector, to encour-
age— 
(A) competition among States, local gov-
ernments, and the private sector; and 
(B) innovation, energy efficiency, private 
sector participation, and productivity.

Federal 
agency 
shall consider for the purpose of a supple-
mental environmental impact statement 
new information received after the close of a

mental environmental impact statement is 
final; and 
‘‘(II) if applicable, an earlier date after

cumstances that warrant the granting of the

lic health, safety, and the environment, and 
the potential for significant negative effects

‘‘(i) JUDICIAL REVIEW.— 
‘‘(1) 
STANDING.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, a plaintiff may only 
bring a claim arising under Federal law 
seeking judicial review of a portion of the 
NEPA process if the plaintiff pleads facts 
that allege that the plaintiff has personally 
suffered, or will likely personally suffer, a 
direct, tangible harm as a result of the por-
tion of the NEPA process for which the 
plaintiff is seeking review. 
‘‘(2) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law and except as provided 
in subparagraph (B)(ii), a claim arising under 
Federal law seeking judicial review of any 
portion of the NEPA process shall be barred 
unless it is filed not later than the earlier 
of— 
‘‘(i) 150 days after the final agency action 
under the NEPA process has been taken; and 
‘‘(ii) if applicable, an earlier date after 
which judicial review is barred that is speci-
fied in the Federal law pursuant to which the 
judicial review is allowed. 
‘‘(B) NEW INFORMATION.— 
‘‘(i) 
CONSIDERATION.—A 
Federal 
agency 
shall consider for the purpose of a supple-
mental environmental impact statement 
new information received after the close of a 
comment period if the information satisfies 
the requirements for a supplemental envi-
ronmental impact statement under the regu-
lations of the Federal agency. 
‘‘(ii) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BASED ON NEW 
INFORMATION.—If a supplemental environ-
mental impact statement is required under 
the regulations of a Federal agency, a claim 
for judicial review of the supplemental envi-
ronmental impact statement shall be barred 
unless it is filed not later than the earlier 
of— 
‘‘(I) 150 days after the publication of a no-
tice in the Federal Register that the supple-
mental environmental impact statement is 
final; and 
‘‘(II) if applicable, an earlier date after 
which judicial review is barred that is speci-
fied in the Federal law pursuant to which the 
judicial review is allowed. 
‘‘(C) SAVINGS
CLAUSE.—Nothing in this 
paragraph creates a right to judicial review. 
‘‘(3) REMEDIES.— 
‘‘(A) PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTIONS
AND
TEM-
PORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clause (ii), in 
a motion for a temporary restraining order 
or preliminary injunction against a Federal 
agency or project sponsor in a claim arising 
under Federal law seeking judicial review of 
any portion of the NEPA process, the plain-
tiff shall establish by clear and convincing 
evidence that— 
‘‘(I) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the 
merits; 
‘‘(II) the plaintiff is likely to suffer irrep-
arable harm in the absence of the temporary 
restraining order or preliminary injunction, 
as applicable; 
‘‘(III) the balance of equities is tipped in 
the favor of the plaintiff; and 
‘‘(IV) the temporary restraining order or 
preliminary injunction is in the public inter-
est. 
‘‘(ii) ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS.—A court 
may not grant a motion described in clause 
(i) unless the court— 
‘‘(I) makes a finding of extraordinary cir-
cumstances that warrant the granting of the 
motion; 
‘‘(II) considers the potential effects on pub-
lic health, safety, and the environment, and 
the potential for significant negative effects 
on jobs resulting from granting the motion; 
and 
‘‘(III) notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, applies the requirements of Rule 65(c) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
‘‘(B) PERMANENT INJUNCTIONS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clause (ii), in 
a motion for a permanent injunction against 
a Federal agency or project sponsor a claim 
arising under Federal law seeking judicial 
review of any portion of the NEPA process, 
the plaintiff shall establish by clear and con-
vincing evidence that— 
‘‘(I) the plaintiff has suffered an irrep-
arable injury; 
‘‘(II) remedies available at law, including 
monetary damages, are inadequate to com-
pensate for the injury; 
‘‘(III) considering the balance of hardship 
between the plaintiff and defendant, a rem-
edy in equity is warranted; 
‘‘(IV) the public interest is not disserved 
by a permanent injunction; and

agency in a statement required under this 
title is the grounds for which the plaintiff is

sion is likely to result in specific, irrep-
arable damage to the environment.

SHOWING.—A court may 
not grant a motion described in clause (i) un-
less— 
‘‘(I) the court makes a finding that ex-
traordinary circumstances exist that war-

SEC. 71201. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Making Ob-
ligations Right by Enlarging Payments In 
Lieu of Taxes Act’’ or the ‘‘MORE PILT 
Act’’. 
SEC. 71202. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) Congress agreed with recommendations 
of a Federal commission that, if Federal land 
is to be retained by the Federal Government 
and not contribute to the tax bases of the 
units of general local government within the 
jurisdictions of which the land is located, 
compensation should be offered to those 
units of general local government to make 
up for the presence of nontaxable land within 
the jurisdictions of those units of general 
local government; 
(2)(A) units of general local government 
rely on the stability of property tax reve-
nues; and 
(B) Federal programs that are subject to 
the annual appropriations process, such as 
the payment in lieu of taxes program, offer 
far less certainty than property taxes as a 
form of revenue for units of general local 
government; 
(3) Federal agencies have determined that 
payments to units of general local govern-
ment under the payment in lieu of taxes pro-
gram are far lower than what would be due 
to units of general local government under 
tax equivalency; 
(4) payments under the payment in lieu of 
taxes program help units of general local 
government carry out vital services, such as 
firefighting, police protection, public edu-
cation, construction of public schools, con-
struction of roads, and search-and-rescue op-
erations; and 
(5) the technology exists to more accu-
rately approximate what the taxable value of

land held by the Federal Government would 
be if that land were taxable by units of gen-
eral local government. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress 
that 
the 
Federal 
Government 
should— 
(1) determine the amount that payments 
under the payment in lieu of taxes program 
would be if those payments were equivalent 
to the tax revenues that units of general 
local government would otherwise receive 
for the same land; and 
(2) compensate those units of general local 
government accordingly. 
SEC. 71203. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) ENTITLEMENT LAND.—The term ‘‘entitle-
ment land’’ has the meaning given the term 
in section 6901 of title 31, United States 
Code.

SEC. 4. PRESERVATION OF STATE, LOCAL, AND 
TRIBAL 
AUTHORITIES 
WITH 
RE-
SPECT TO CIVIL UNMANNED AIR-
CRAFT SYSTEMS. 
(a) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) Using its constitutional authority to 
regulate commerce among the States, Con-
gress granted the Federal Government au-
thority over all of the navigable airspace in 
the United States in order to foster air com-
merce. 
(B) While the regulation of the navigable 
airspace is within the Federal Government’s 
domain, the Supreme Court recognized in 
United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), 
that the Federal Government’s regulatory 
authority is limited by the property rights 
possessed by landowners over the exclusive 
control of the immediate reaches of their 
airspace. 
(C) As a sovereign government, a State 
possesses police powers, which include the 
power to protect the property rights of its 
citizens. 
(D) The proliferation of low-altitude oper-
ations of unmanned aircraft systems has cre-
ated a conflict between the responsibility of 
the Federal Government to regulate the nav-
igable airspace and the inherent sovereign 
police power possessed by the States to pro-
tect the property rights of their citizens. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) in order for landowners to have full en-
joyment and use of their land, they must 
have exclusive control of the immediate 
reaches of airspace over their property; 
(B) the States possess sovereign police 
powers, which include the power to regulate 
land use, protect property rights, and exer-
cise zoning authority; and 
(C) the Federal Government lacks the au-
thority to intrude upon a State’s sovereign 
right to issue reasonable time, manner, and 
place restrictions on the operation of un-
manned aircraft systems operating within 
the immediate reaches of airspace. 
(b) REQUIREMENTS
RELATED
TO
REGULA-
TIONS AND STANDARDS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—In prescribing regulations 
or standards related to civil unmanned air-
craft systems, the following shall apply: 
(A) The Administrator shall not authorize 
the operation of a civil unmanned aircraft in 
the immediate reaches of airspace above 
property without permission of the property 
owner. 
(B) Subject to paragraph (2), in the case of 
a structure that exceeds 200 feet above 
ground level, the Administrator shall not au-
thorize the operation of a civil unmanned 
aircraft— 
(i) within 50 feet of the top of such struc-
ture; or 
(ii) within 200 feet laterally of such struc-
ture or inside the property line of such struc-
ture’s owner, whichever is closer to such 
structure. 
(C) The Administrator shall not authorize 
the physical contact of a civil unmanned air-
craft, including such aircraft’s take-off or 
landing, with a structure that exceeds 200 
feet above ground level without permission 
of the structure’s owner. 
(D) The Administrator shall ensure that 
the authority of a State, local, or Tribal gov-
ernment to issue reasonable restrictions on 
the time, manner, and place of operation of 
a civil unmanned aircraft system that is op-
erated below 200 feet above ground level is 
not preempted.
