PRAYER 
Rabbi Hannah Spiro, Hill Havurah, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
Creator of all, at this time when 
Jews around the world are preparing 
for Purim—for a time of confronting 
hate and persecution with courage, 
pride, and a sense of humor—help us 
find that laughter and that love for 
ourselves and one another, even when 
the world seems to be crashing down 
around us. 
When the world is upside down, teach 
us 
how 
to 
cartwheel, 
audaciously 
adapting and returning rooted, always 
back to who we truly are. 
May our bold open-heartedness bring 
forth a world of peace, of righteous-
ness, and of jubilation for our families, 
for our communities, for our Nation, 
and for all who dwell on Earth. 
We know that every soul deserves 
peace. We know that every soul de-
serves celebration. May we be Your 
vessels to bring that time about quick-
ly and in our day. 
And let us say: 
Amen.

JOINT 
EXPLANATORY 
MATERIAL 
STATEMENT 
ON 
THE 
INTEL-
LIGENCE 
AUTHORIZATION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2022, 
SUB-
MITTED BY MR. SCHIFF, CHAIR-
MAN 
OF 
THE 
HOUSE 
PERMA-
NENT 
SELECT 
COMMITTEE 
ON 
INTELLIGENCE 
The following is the Joint Explanatory 
Statement (the ‘‘Explanatory Statement’’) 
to the Intelligence Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2022 (‘‘the Act’’), which has been 
included as Division X of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2022. The Explanatory 
Statement reflects the result of negotiations 
and disposition of issues reached between the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
(‘‘SSCI’’) and the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence (‘‘HPSCI’’) (to-
gether, the ‘‘Committees’’). The Explanatory 
Statement shall have the same effect with 
respect to the implementation of the Act as 
if it were a joint explanatory statement of a 
conference committee. 
The 
Explanatory 
Statement 
comprises 
three parts: an overview of the application of 
the annex to accompany this statement; a 
statement on anomalous health incidents; 
and unclassified congressional direction. 
PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX 
AND SCHEDULE OF AUTHORIZATIONS 
The classified nature of U.S. intelligence 
activities prevents the Committees from 
publicly disclosing many details concerning 
their final decisions regarding funding levels 
and policy direction. Therefore, in addition 
to the Schedule of Authorizations a classi-
fied annex to the Act—referred to here and 
within the annex itself as the ‘‘Agree-
ment’’—has been prepared to describe in de-
tail the scope and intent of the Committees’ 
actions. 
The Agreement supersedes the classified 
annexes that accompanied H.R. 5412 and S. 
2610; and reconciles differences between the 
Committees, with respect to the National In-
telligence Program (NIP). The Agreement 
also makes recommendations for the Mili-
tary Intelligence Program (MIP) and the In-
formation 
Systems 
Security 
Program 
(ISSP). The Agreement authorizes the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) to obligate and ex-
pend funds not altered or modified by the 
classified Schedule of Authorizations as re-
quested in the President’s budget, subject to 
modification under applicable reprogram-
ming procedures. 
The classified Schedule of Authorizations 
is incorporated into the bill pursuant to Sec-
tion 102. It has the status of law. The Agree-
ment supplements and adds detail to clarify 
the authorization levels found in the bill and 
the classified Schedule of Authorizations. 
The Committees view direction and rec-
ommendations, whether contained in the Ex-
planatory Statement or in the Agreement, as 
requiring 
compliance 
by 
the 
Executive 
Branch. 
PART II: STATEMENT REGARDING ANOMALOUS 
HEALTH INCIDENTS 
From the time the Committees received 
the first ‘‘Havana Syndrome’’ reports, the 
Committees have focused intently on the 
anomalous health incidents (‘‘AHIs’’) that 
have afflicted United States Government 
personnel, including many in the Intel-
ligence Community (IC) and other United 
States Government personnel. Provisions of 
the Act reflect that continuing, bicameral 
and bipartisan effort. 
The Biden Administration also has pursued 
its own initiatives. As directed by Congress, 
it earlier this year appointed a senior offi-
cial, within the National Security Council, 
to oversee the government’s response to 
AHIs. Additionally, in recent months, a 
widely-discussed assessment concluded that 
a majority of reported AHIs can be explained 
by medical conditions or environmental or 
technical factors, and that it is unlikely that 
a foreign actor—including Russia—is en-
gaged in a sustained, global campaign in-
volving hundreds of incidents without detec-
tion. But the assessment left other cases un-
explained, including a small subset that the 
IC continues to scrutinize most closely. 
Around the same time, an IC panel of ex-
perts determined that certain AHIs cannot 
be explained by environmental or medical 
conditions, but could be due to external 
stimuli. While acknowledging important in-
formation gaps, the panel further determined 
that pulsed electromagnetic energy—and, in 
some cases, ultrasound—plausibly might ex-
plain AHIs’ core characteristics; and that 
psychosocial factors alone could not account 
for those characteristics, though they might 
cause some other incidents or contribute to 
long-term symptoms. 
These findings advance the United States’ 
understanding of AHIs. But these findings 
are also heavily qualified, tentative, and 
based on a developing and incomplete body 
of evidence and scientific and medical 
knowledge. Most important, as the Commit-
tees wish to stress, these recent develop-
ments do not justify shifting the Executive 
Branch’s AHI-related activities into a lower 
gear, or discrediting the reports of AHI vic-
tims. 
The core work on AHIs—to include exam-
ination of a potential role by one or more 
foreign actors—must continue apace. As 
with prior inquiries into complex and murky 
intelligence problems, unraveling the AHI 
mystery fully may take time. It might be 
years before the United States reaches defin-
itive conclusions about exactly who, or 
what, is behind AHIs. 
The Administration has acknowledged that 
a great deal remains to be done. Indeed, 
much more evidence will have to be gath-
ered. Plausible theories regarding responsi-
bility for AHIs will have to be weighed 
against a record that will grow and change 
over time, and potentially may have to be 
revisited if circumstances warrant. And no 
plausible theory should be ruled out or 
downplayed prematurely. 
Success will depend on many factors. 
Among other things, it will be important to 
have a well-resourced cadre of ‘‘cross- 
cleared’’ individuals, at all relevant IC ele-
ments and other Executive Branch organiza-
tions, who can readily review and analyze all 
relevant intelligence and information, and 
without hindrances. The Committees long 
have emphasized this, with respect to AHI 
and many other priority intelligence mat-
ters. However, the Executive Branch has yet 
to take all necessary steps, to do away with 
excessive compartmentation and unneces-
sary bureaucracy; and to ensure that, for 
AHI and for other vital missions, the right 
people consistently and easily can access 
necessary information. That will have to 
change. 
Treatment also must remain a matter of 
highest priority. All AHI victims must be en-
couraged to file prompt reports of their expe-
riences, and without fear of being disbelieved 
or dismissed. They and their families must 
receive the highest quality medical and 
other care and must receive that care imme-
diately. Thus far, some bureaucratic road-
blocks to the provision of care have been re-
moved—but there is no excuse for any to re-
main. They must be dismantled. And new 
ones must not be erected. 
Above all, there can be no slowing down, in 
the investigation into AHIs and in the treat-
ment of AHI victims and their families. To 
do so would risk signaling—to those individ-
uals, to the broader IC workforce, and to the 
wider world—that, though it prioritized the 
issue most highly for a discrete time, the 
United States is ‘‘moving on’’ from AHIs. 
That cannot be allowed to happen. And the 
Committees will continue to conduct vig-
orous oversight, to prevent it from hap-
pening. 
PART III: UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL 
DIRECTION

porates by reference, and the Executive 
Branch shall comply with, all direction con-

DAVE MURPHY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Friday, March 11, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Dave Murphy 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Dave Murphy is a student at Arvada West 
High School and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Dave Mur-
phy is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Dave Murphy for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-

IN 
HONOR 
OF 
THE 
EXTRAOR-
DINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF 
MRS. BEATRICE PRICE 
TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 11, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the remarkable life and legacy of Be-
atrice Muse Price, a pioneering Army nurse to 
the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, 
who passed away at age 98 on March 4, 
2022. 
Mrs. Price was born the second of six chil-
dren on January 21, 1924, in Bessemer, Ala-
bama, to the late Henry and Frances Muse. 
Graduating from Hale County Training School, 
she went on to attend Grady Memorial School 
of Nursing in Atlanta, Georgia, where she 
graduated in 1944 as a Registered Nurse. She 
continued her education at the University of 
Maryland, Tuskegee University, and Miles Col-
lege. 
Mrs. Price began her career in nursing, 
serving as a chief nurse for a private hospital 
in Detroit, Michigan. She then joined the Army 
Nurses Corps in WWII, serving as a 2nd Lieu-
tenant then later as 1st Lieutenant. During her 
time in the military, Mrs. Price was assigned to 
care for the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the first 
African American military aviator unit in the 
United States Army. From 1944 to 1948, Mrs. 
Price showed exemplary courage and service 
to the Tuskegee Airmen, earning her the pres-
tigious Congressional Gold Medal along with 
the men she cared for. Her heroic military 
service to our country broke many barriers for 
future generations of Black nurses. 
Mrs. Price had a stellar 42-year career in 
nursing. After her discharge in 1948, she went 
on to work in the U.S. Public Health Service 
for three years. Then, she spent the next 34 
years working as a nurse at the Birmingham 
VA Medical Center. She was ultimately pro-
moted to be the Night Nursing Supervisor, a 
position she held for twenty years until she re-
tired on January 2, 1988. 
Mrs. Price received countless awards for 
her remarkable leadership and contributions to 
the nursing profession. In 1985, VA depart-
ment heads in Birmingham selected Mrs. Price 
as the first recipient of the distinguished Ad-
ministrator’s Award for Excellence in Nursing. 
In 2011, Mrs. Price was selected by America’s 
oral history project, StoryCorps, to create an 
audio recording of her incredible life story. She 
also received national recognition in 2013, 
from the international Black nurse’s sorority. 
Chi Eta Phi, for being a True Nursing Pioneer. 
Throughout her life, Mrs. Price was a faithful 
servant leader. She was an active member of 
the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, serving for 
over sixty years as a member of the Dea-
coness Board, founder of the Wellness Min-
istry, and co-founder of a Sunday School 
class. 
Mrs. Price is preceded in death by her hus-
band of 37 years, Charles E. Price, Sr; par-
ents Henry and Mary Frances Muse; sister, 
Ruth Outland; two brothers Eugene Muse and 
Theodore 
Muse, 
Sr.; 
two 
stepdaughters 
Norma Jean Price and Charlotte Price; and 
granddaughter, April Price. She is survived by 
one daughter Gill Hickman (G. Michael); two 
sons Joseph Diop (Betty Ann) and Michael 
Price (Anita); two surrogate daughters Karen 
Beverly West (John ‘‘Bev’’) and Amelia Jones; 
a daughter-in-law Sherrell Price; one brother 
Henry Muse, Sr. (Eulasteen); one sister Annie 
Bell Dawson; ten grandchildren Angela Terry 
(Anthony), Kimberly Crago (Stephen), Michael 
B. Hickman, Bennie Stephen Hurst (Fred-
erica), Mannye Franklin (Preston), Arianne 
Price, Ashley Price, Tyler Price, Serena 
James, and Yolanda Roberts; one surrogate 
granddaughter Anniko ‘‘Nicole’’ Richardson 
(Jay); seven nieces and nephews John 
Outland, Jr. (Patricia), Monica Chambers, 
Kenneth Muse, Theodore Muse Jr. (Marquita), 
Arleen Livingston, Darlene Davis, Anita Muse; 
best friend and colleague Juanita Hixon; dear 
friends Leona Steward and Veronica Pettway; 
and a host of great-grandchildren, cousins, 
friends and church members. 
On a personal note, Mrs. Price was a 
source of great inspiration for me and so 
many young black women. A trailblazer and 
pioneer in the field of nursing, she was de-
voted to her church, her family, and her serv-
ice to this nation. A woman of tremendous 
faith, Mrs. Price served honorably during 
World 
War 
II 
alongside 
the 
legendary 
Tuskegee Airmen. As Alabama’s first Black 
Congresswoman, it was my high honor to be-
stow upon her a Congressional Gold Medal for 
her courage, bravery, and exemplary service. 
I was also elated to host Mrs. Price in Wash-
ington at the State of the Union in 2013. For 
all of her accomplishments, Mrs. Price was al-
ways gracious, sweet, compassionate, and 
humble—always helping others with a smile 
and an extended hand. I am eternally grateful 
for our friendship, mentorship, and special 
bond. I want to thank her family for sharing 
her with the world. May we find comfort in 
knowing that she lived a full blessed life, and 
her legacy will live on in the hearts and ac-
tions of those she impacted. Rest in Peace 
and Power, thy good and faithful servant. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Mrs. Beatrice Muse Price and her dedicated 
service that helped transform American His-
tory.

of the American Village to be an American his-

American Village, an 188-acre campus in 
Montevallo, Alabama, became chartered in 
1995 and has since educated and inspired 
over 750,000 children as well as adults across 
the southeastern United States. American Vil-
lage has welcomed thousands of public visi-
tors each year for a true American Experi-
ence. 
Before founding American Village, Tom 
earned his bachelor’s degree, with honors, in 
history and political science from the Univer-
sity of Montevallo and his master’s degree in 
political science from Mississippi State Univer-
sity. 
Tom Walker is the former City Manager of 
Northport, Alabama, and served as the Spe-
cial Assistant to the President of the University 
of Montevallo. He is also the former Vice 
Chair of the Board of Trustees at the Univer-
sity of Montevallo and was the founding chair 
of the AL Higher Education Partnership. 
Since founding the American Village, Tom 
has received numerous awards and honors. In 
2017, he was one of only sixteen private citi-
zens appointed to the Semiquincentennial 
Commission to organize the 250th birthday 
celebration of the United States of America. In 
December of 2020, Tom was conferred the 
Honorary Doctor of Laws by Troy University. 
He is a past recipient of the American Bar As-
sociation’s highest national award for excel-
lence in K–12 law-related education. He is the 
recipient of the DAR Medal of Honor and the 
SAR Gold Citizenship Medal, the highest na-
tional honors awarded by the National Soci-
eties of the Daughters of the American Revo-
lution, and of the Sons of the American Revo-
lution, respectively. He has received numerous 
other state, regional and national awards and 
was named as Birmingham Citizen of the Year 
by The Women’s Committee of Birmingham in 
2014. 
Tom once said, We must build good citizens 
and leaders who will cherish these ideals, and 
thereby learn to love our country, and what an 
incredible job of that he has done these past 
35 years working with the students of the 
southeast. 
Upon his retirement, Tom looks forward to 
spending more time with his wife, Betty, three 
children: his son, Matt and wife Candace; his 
daughter, Jane Herndon and her husband 
Josh; and his son Jefferson, along with his 
grandson, Wells Thomas Herndon. He will 
continue to maintain an office and an active 
part-time Founder and Director-Emeritus posi-
tion at the American Village, as he continues 
to prepare the nation’s youth to become lead-
ers. 
Since my own appointment to the United 
States 
Semiquincentennial 
Commission, 
I 
have had the honor to serve alongside Tom. 
I have grown to admire and respect his great 
love for American history, his solid values and 
his strong faith in God, which are the founda-
tions that have made this nation great. It has 
been a privilege to work with him on this com-
mission, but more importantly to call him my 
friend. I look forward to his continued service 
in that role. 
As a community leader, educator, and 
friend, Tom Walker has touched the lives of 
countless Americans, including myself. There-
fore, I ask you to join with me in congratu-
lating Tom Walker on an inspirational 35 years 
of work and service to Montevallo, the State of 
Alabama, and the United States of America.

HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 11, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, on Thursday, 
March 3, 2022, this body considered amend-
ments and final passage of H.R. 3967, the 
Honoring our PACT Act. One amendment 
voted on before this chamber was Mr. Ryan of 
Ohio’s amendment number 23 which added 
the text of the SFC Heath Robinson Burn Pit 
Transparency Act to the bill. 
While I did not support final passage of this 
bill, I did support several of amendments of-
fered to it. Amendment 23 was one such 
amendment. Due to error on the House floor, 
my amendment was incorrectly cast as no. 
This was an error and I rise today to correct 
my vote and indicate that I intended to vote 
yes, in favor of amendment 23. While I have 
issues with the underlying bill, this amendment 
was a strong addition to ensure we provide an 
adequate level of care to our nation’s veterans 
who are suffering from toxic exposure during 
their service to this country. 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate that I intended 
to vote in favor of amendment 23.

HONORING 
FEDERAL 
HEALTH 
WORKERS DEPLOYED TO SPAR-
ROW HOSPITAL IN LANSING 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 11, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the heroic caregivers at Sparrow 
Hospital in Lansing, Michigan, including the 
Department of Defense medical team which 
has been providing critical assistance as the 
hospital has grappled with a surge in COVID 
patients over the last few months. 
In early February 2022, as the omicron vari-
ant drove case levels to new heights, a team 
of 23 federal medical personnel, including phy-
sicians, registered nurses, and respiratory 
therapists, arrived in Lansing to provide much- 
needed help to Sparrow’s staff. The team has 
spent the past month providing invaluable aid 
to the hospital’s overtaxed Emergency Depart-
ment, and in other areas of the hospital over-
whelmed by extraordinarily high patient vol-
umes. This team has worked alongside Spar-
row’s staff with grace, grit, and profes-
sionalism, and they have been invaluable to 
the hospital’s service to the Greater Lansing 
area. Michigan’s healthcare heroes, including 
the staff at Sparrow Hospital, have been on 
the frontlines of this battle for the past two 
years under the most intense and stressful 
conditions. But their commitment to the safety 
and health of our community never wavered. 
I’ve heard stories of caregivers who have held 
the phone to the ear of a dying patient so a 
family could say goodbye; others who have 
developed special relationships with patient’s 
loved ones; and some who have worked with 
tireless dedication only to break down in their 
cars at the end of the day from what they’re 
living through. 
Sparrow Specialty Hospital leaders even or-
ganized a wedding ceremony—bringing deco-
rations from home and filling in the wedding 
party—for a COVID patient who realized the 
shortness of life and decided to marry his 
longtime love as soon as possible. While the 
dedication shown by our health workers is re-
markable, so too is the emotional and physical 
strain they’ve been put under. 
The brave men and women of the military 
are called to serve their country, and we are 
so grateful to this team for the immense relief 
they have provided in the battle against this 
invisible enemy. I will never forget the cheers 
and tears I saw firsthand as the team arrived, 
in uniform, marching down Sparrow’s hallway. 
I knew immediately they would feel right at 
home alongside the mission-driven team at 
Sparrow, and that this partnership would yield 
much-needed hope and relief. 
We are so grateful to all who have cared for 
and comforted COVID patients and their fami-
lies through two years of unrelenting de-
mands, and to this remarkable partnership be-
tween the Department of Defense medical 
team and Sparrow Hospital. On behalf of a 
grateful community and nation, it is my great 
honor to record their remarkable service to 
Mid-Michigan so that their actions may be 
known to all.
