BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate gavels back in for another 
busy week of an exceedingly busy work 
period. There is a lot we must continue 
working on to lower costs for the 
American 
people; 
strengthen 
healthcare and prescription drug costs, 
make sure they are low; confirm highly 
qualified nominees; protect our funda-
mental rights; and fortify U.S. national 
security interests. None of this is easy, 
but we are moving ahead. 
In a few hours, the Senate will take 
another important step towards finally 
passing our bipartisan chips and inno-
vation bill by voting to invoke cloture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3620 
July 25, 2022 
After more than a year of hard work on 
fixing U.S. chip supplies and boosting 
American scientific innovation, we are 
on the brink of closing the book and 
passing these critical investments into 
law. 
If cloture is invoked, Members should 
plan to vote on final passage as early 
as tomorrow evening or Wednesday. 
When signed into law, the impacts of 
this bipartisan chips and innovation 
bill will last years, if not decades. It 
will mean an increase in American 
jobs, increased manufacturing here at 
home, relief for our supply chains, and 
lower costs for the American people. 
Of course, we will also preserve 
America’s security interests. One of 
the most important struggles of this 
century will be the fight for global 
semiconductor supply. Sadly, America 
is lagging behind. A recent article from 
the Wall Street Journal revealed that 
the Chinese Communist Party is plan-
ning 
31 
major 
semiconductor 
fabs 
planned over the next few years in a 
bid to become the world’s leader in new 
chip factories. American chip pro-
ducers are working hard to match this 
output, but they are waiting for Con-
gress to finish work on this bill. Tens 
of billions of dollars and countless 
good-paying jobs are at stake. For that 
reason, I am glad we are close to push-
ing this bill over the goal line. 
Of course, there is a lot more to cele-
brate about this bill. The bipartisan 
science provisions—many of which I 
authored in partnership with Senator 
YOUNG under the Endless Frontier Act 
more than 2 years ago—will unleash a 
new wave of American scientific inno-
vation that will last and create mil-
lions of good-paying jobs for decades to 
come. 
We will invest tens of billions to 
strengthen the National Science Foun-
dation and plant seeds to cultivate the 
tech hubs of tomorrow in regions of the 
country that have tremendous poten-
tial but have long been overlooked. 
When we invest in science jobs, that 
will keep America No. 1. 
For decades, the United States was 
consistently the world leader in inno-
vation and scientific research because 
we made the investments necessary to 
stay on top, and the result was mil-
lions and millions of good-paying jobs 
that made us the strongest economy on 
Earth, the envy of the world. In the 
last decade, unfortunately, we have 
slipped from our place on the moun-
taintop. This bill will help us recapture 
that goal and that dream. 
The 21st century will be won or lost 
on the battleground of technological 
innovation. This is perhaps the most 
competitive era in human history. Will 
American workers, will American tech, 
will American ingenuity shape the 
world over the next hundred years in 
the same way that we have shaped it in 
the last hundred? 
I believe we can. I believe we must. 
When we pass this bill, I believe we 
will. Let’s move forward today. 
HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, now on healthcare 
reforms 
and 
reconciliation: 
Senate 
Democrats continue our work to ad-
vance legislation that will lower costs 
and improve the lives of tens of mil-
lions of American families. 
Last week, Democrats and Repub-
licans held our bipartisan prescription 
drugs Byrd bath meetings with the 
Parliamentarian. As a reminder, this 
important preliminary step will clear 
the 
way 
for 
passing 
our 
reforms 
through the reconciliation process. I 
want to thank Chairs WYDEN, SANDERS, 
and MURRAY and the tireless work of 
their Finance, Budget, and HELP Com-
mittee staffs for working around the 
clock on this important effort. 
If you want to fight inflation, then 
you should support passing this much 
needed proposal on lowering prescrip-
tion drug costs. Here is why: For the 
first time ever, we will empower Medi-
care to negotiate the price of many ex-
pensive and vital prescription drugs, 
directly lowering what patients and 
taxpayers pay for these drugs. We will 
cap Americans’ out-of-pocket drug ex-
penses to $2,000 a year. Medicare will 
offer free vaccines and additional sup-
port for the low-income elderly. And, 
crucially, we will ensure that millions 
don’t see their healthcare premiums 
skyrocket in the coming months. 
Let me say it again because it is key, 
and I say it to our Republican col-
leagues across the aisle. If you want to 
help Americans better afford their 
healthcare and medications, then you 
should support passing this bill. 
United States citizens pay more, on 
average, for prescription drugs than 
any other people on Earth, all for the 
exact same medicines that other coun-
tries use. The Democratic plan will fi-
nally help change that. 
Too many in this country find them-
selves in the confounding indignity of 
having to choose between getting their 
prescription drugs filled or putting 
food on the table for their families. The 
Democrats’ 
plan 
will 
finally 
help 
change that. 
And even as working Americans 
struggle 
to 
afford 
high-quality 
healthcare and medications, the Na-
tion’s largest pharmaceutical compa-
nies face little accountability for jack-
ing up prices on consumers. Again, the 
Democrats’ plan will help change that. 
For months, we have heard Repub-
licans complain and complain about 
the need to lower costs for the Amer-
ican 
people. 
Well, 
Democrats 
will 
present the Senate with a proposal 
that will do precisely that in a very big 
way. What will they choose on the 
other side of the aisle? Will they work 
with us to lower the costs for prescrip-
tion medications? Will they shore up 
our healthcare system and prevent dev-
astating price hikes? Will they finally 
join us holding Big Pharma account-
able? 
This isn’t complicated. Senators can 
vote to lower costs, or they can vote 
for higher costs. The American people 
will be watching. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the past year and a half, Wash-
ington Democrats have continually 
found new ways to be wrong about the 
U.S. economy. Last springtime, Demo-
crats insisted their plan to dump $1.9 
trillion onto the economy would not 
cause inflation. 
Here was the Democratic leader in 
March of 2021: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near term, are very real. 
And here was President Biden: 
The biggest risk is not going too big . . . 
it’s if we go too small.’’ 
Well, obviously, they were entirely 
wrong. Their reckless spending fueled 
the worst inflation in 40 years. As Ms. 
Alvarado, a teacher and mother of 
three, explained to a reporter—here is 
what she said: 
When I say, ‘‘OK, we cannot buy anything 
this week or else we’ll go into overdraft,’’ 
[my husband] says, ‘‘No, what are you talk-
ing 
about? 
We’re 
both 
working. 
That 
shouldn’t happen.’’ 
Well, it shouldn’t have happened, but 
it is exactly what Democrats’ policies 
have inflicted on working families in 
this country. 
Every time I fill up our van, I’m flab-
bergasted— 
Ms. Alvarado explains— 
I’m always worrying. . . . I can postpone 
the mortgage by two weeks, but then it be-
comes two more weeks, and then all of a sud-
den they’re calling you. 
After Democrats’ policies that did 
cause inflation, they moved on to their 
next wrong prediction. President Biden 
admitted inflation did, in fact, exist 
but said it was ‘‘expected to be tem-
porary.’’ That one didn’t work out ei-
ther. That was over a year ago. 
Then, 7 months ago, in early Decem-
ber, President Biden promised inflation 
had peaked—wrong again. It didn’t 
peak in December. It just kept getting 
worse. Inflation set a fresh new 40-year 
high just last month. 
These same folks are preparing for 
yet another battle against reality. In 
advance of the GDP numbers coming 
out later this week, the Biden adminis-
tration has begun their latest project: 
a frantic effort to redefine the word 
‘‘recession.’’ The White House pub-
lished a whole explanation insisting 
that even if the new data suggested our 
country is in recession, we actually 
won’t be. 
It is almost beyond satire. The White 
House isn’t focusing their energies on

correcting their mistakes and making 
the economy better for working fami-
lies who are hurting. Instead, their pri-
ority is telling everybody things aren’t 
as bad as they look or feel. They want 
working Americans like Ms. Alvarado 
to believe Democrats’ spin instead of 
their own lying eyes. 
I guess the whopping 42 percent of 
Americans who say they are struggling 
to stay where they are financially are 
supposed to read the White House press 
release and cheer up. The same people 
who said inflation wouldn’t happen and 
then said it would be transitory and 
then said it had peaked last year are 
now insisting we aren’t heading into a 
recession. Well, draw your own conclu-
sions. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, staring down the barrel of the eco-
nomic disaster they have created, 
Washington Democrats still don’t ap-
pear to be pumping the brakes on their 
reckless agenda. For example, the 
same Democrats who spent our country 
into inflation are now angling to regu-
late our medical cures industry into 
fewer new cures and fewer lifesaving 
treatments. 
American researchers and manufac-
turers are the driving force behind cut-
ting-edge treatments that the entire 
world relies on. American innovators 
are leading the races to cure terminal 
illnesses like Parkinson’s and Alz-
heimer’s. 
The entire world benefits from our 
genius, but, in particular, the Amer-
ican people get first and fastest access 
to the latest new treatments, cures, 
and medical marvels. But the Demo-
crats’ pursuit of prescription drug so-
cialism could put all of this at risk. 
Arbitrary, 
top-down, 
government 
price controls would dry out the wells 
of American innovation to the tune of 
hundreds of billions of dollars in lost 
research and development, and Amer-
ican patients would feel the pain. The 
cost of breakthrough cures is measured 
in dollars, but the cost of neglecting 
them would be measured in lost years 
of American life. 
One academic analysis pegged that 
true cost at a cumulative 331.5 million 
years. 
Let me say that again: One expert 
says the negative effects of Democrats’ 
proposal on medical research would 
cost a collective total of 331.5 million 
cumulative years of life. 
In other words, their proposal would 
eventually destroy as many years of 
Americans’ lives as there are Ameri-
cans to live them. 
Just 2 years ago, Democrats were lin-
ing up with Republicans and the rest of 
the country to cheer the American re-
searchers and innovators who were 
driving the race for a COVID–19 vac-
cine—a race they finished in record 
time. 
The American people know what it 
looks like when lifesaving advances 
happen right here at home. Unfortu-
nately, they may be about to find what 
happens when they don’t. 
BURMA 
Madam President, now, on one final 
matter, over the weekend, Burma’s 
long and difficult struggle toward de-
mocracy and freedom took another 
dark step backward. The brutal mili-
tary junta controlling Burma exe-
cuted—executed—four 
political 
pris-
oners, including the well-known activ-
ist Ko Jimmy and Phyo Zeya Thaw, a 
former elected official and protest mu-
sician—yet more innocent bloodshed 
for the crime of dissenting against the 
junta’s illegitimate rule. 
This is yet another atrocity in a long 
list of horrors committed by the junta 
with no legitimacy, no regard for the 
sanctity of human life, and no respect 
for its fellow citizens. It provides even 
further evidence that the junta does 
not fear any consequences for its ac-
tions—not from internal chaos, not 
from civil war, not from its neighbors, 
not from the so-called international 
community. 
The United States has led efforts to 
support Burma’s people and to impose 
costs and consequences on the junta. 
Clearly, it is time for Burma’s neigh-
bors to shoulder a larger burden as 
well. It is time for ASEAN states to 
step up, individually and collectively. 
As the junta plunges Burma deeper 
into chaos and civil war, the turmoil 
will affect the entire region. It is Bur-
ma’s neighbors who have the most eco-
nomic influence over the junta, and it 
is Burma’s neighbors who have the 
most at stake. 
Do they want a failed state wracked 
by civil war like Syria on their bor-
ders? Do they want a Russian- or Chi-
nese-backed 
client 
state 
in 
their 
midst? 
If they will not step up and impose 
meaningful costs on the junta, the 
Biden administration should use au-
thorities already given to it by Con-
gress to sanction Burma’s energy sec-
tor, including Myanmar Oil and Gas 
Enterprise, notwithstanding the con-
cerns of those neighbors. 
The people of Burma are risking 
their lives and, in some cases, losing 
their lives to defend their freedom. The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
to 
prioritize democracy and human rights 
in its foreign policy. Here is an oppor-
tunity to demonstrate that it means 
what it says. 
So in sum, it is time for Burma’s 
neighbors to act. If they do not, the 
Biden administration should sanction 
Burma’s 
energy 
and 
other 
major 
sources of revenue for the junta. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
JANUARY 6 HEARINGS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, like 
17 million other Americans, I watched 
the January 6 committee in its latest 
session last Thursday night. For 2 
hours, I was there watching closely as 
they presented witnesses and evidence 
of the obvious. It reminded me that our 
committee—the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee—last October released a report 
that showed in alarming detail how 
former President Donald Trump tried 
to bully the Justice Department into 
overturning an election which he lost. 
Our report showed just how aggres-
sively the defeated President tried to 
hold on to power, how some with the 
Justice Department were actually con-
spiring to help him, and how hard the 
Department’s leadership had to work 
to prevent Trump’s illegal scheme from 
succeeding. 
We knew when we produced our re-
port that it was just one chapter in an 
intricate plot to subvert America’s de-
mocracy. 
In eight public hearings over the last 
6 weeks, the House Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6 Attack on 
the U.S. Capitol has laid out in clear 
and chilling detail more chapters in 
the plot to overturn the 2020 Presi-
dential election. 
The facts are damning. What makes 
them even more shocking and credible 
is that they have been revealed, under 
oath, not by former President Trump’s 
political foes but by people who once 
believed in him—people who worked 
with him for years, close aides, advis-
ers, even his own family members. 
I am sure you remember January 6, 
2021. Those of us who were in this 
Chamber will never forget it. 
We were here in the Senate to count 
the electoral ballots forwarded from 
the States to the Senate and the House 
to confirm the results of the 2020 Presi-
dential election. We heard the furious 
mob outside. They attacked Capitol 
Police officers with hockey sticks, iron 
bars, toxic bear spray, flagpoles—what-
ever weapons they could find. The 
Trump mob was on the march. They 
smashed windows and doors, broke into 
this Capitol Building. 
Capitol Police officers ordered the 
Senators to evacuate the Chamber im-
mediately. I remember it well. They 
first told us: Well, wait here. This will 
be a safe room. Ten minutes later, they 
said: Leave through these back doors 
as quickly as you can; the mob has 
taken over the Capitol. We rushed to a 
secure location. 
For hours, as the Capitol Police and 
DC Metropolitan Police battled the 
mob in brutal hand-to-hand combat, we 
asked the same questions: Where is the 
protection? Where is the National 
Guard? Where is the President? Donald 
Trump set this carnage in motion by 
riling up his supporters with the Big 
Lie and ordering them to march on the 
Capitol. We thought to ourselves, Why 
won’t he tell them to stop? This has 
gone too far. 
The public hearings of the January 6 
Committee have answered the question 
in frightening detail. Where was the 
President? We now know from last 
Thursday’s 
hearing, 
Donald 
Trump 
knew within 15 minutes of finishing his 
remarks that the mob was on its way 
to attack this building and the people 
inside. What did he do? What did Don-
ald Trump do for 3 hours 7 minutes? He 
sat in his private dining room next to 
the Oval Office watching the violence

on TV. He refused to contact his na-
tional security leaders to defend the 
Capitol of the United States of Amer-
ica. He refused pleas from congres-
sional leaders of both parties, from his 
own staff and family, from his allies in 
the media at FOX News to call off the 
mob. He refused to walk less than 60 
seconds to the White House briefing 
room to make a simple statement ask-
ing for the violence to stop. He was si-
lent, and he watched FOX News every 
second of that 3 hours 7 minutes. 
We learned that members of Vice 
President Pence’s Secret Service detail 
actually thought that they might die 
as they confronted this mob. As some 
of those agents made what they feared 
might be their last calls to their fami-
lies to tell them that they loved them, 
President Donald Trump sent out a 
tweet telling the mob Vice President 
Pence had betrayed them. Instead of 
calming the riot, Donald Trump poured 
gasoline on the fire. 
Illinois 
Representative 
ADAM 
KINZINGER, a Republican member of the 
January 6 Committee, summed it up 
well. He said: 
Trump didn’t fail to act . . . he chose not 
to act. 
Only when it was clear that his coup 
had failed did Donald Trump reluc-
tantly record a video telling his sup-
porters to leave the Capitol and go 
home. And he carefully chose his 
words—we can tell from the outtakes— 
not to concede the Big Lie. There was 
not a word of condemnation about the 
violence, not a word of concern for the 
police officers who battled that mob to 
protect our safety and our democracy. 
More than 140 police officers—Capitol 
Police, DC Metropolitan Police—suf-
fered serious injuries on January 6. 
Where is this President who loved law 
and order? Silently watching on FOX. 
Over the next few days and weeks, 
sadly, several officers who defended the 
Capitol died. Not a word from former 
President Trump. 
In the committee’s earlier hearings, 
we learned how the President had ig-
nored his own aides and advisers and 
relentlessly pressed false claims of 
voter fraud, listening to his ‘‘gifted’’ 
legal counsel, Rudy Giuliani, even 
when he was told repeatedly that these 
claims were wrong. 
We learned how he pressured Vice 
President Pence to go along with the 
plan to overturn his loss even after he 
was told by the experts around him: 
President Trump, it would be illegal. 
We learned how President Trump 
pressed elected leaders in key States to 
change the vote totals in their States. 
When that failed, he pressed allies to 
send false slates of electors that would 
make him the winner. 
He learned how to summon a mob to 
Washington and turned them loose on 
this building, even after being told the 
mob was carrying weapons. And even 
after all the harm his Big Lie has done 
to our democracy, he is still relent-
lessly peddling it. 
Outtakes aired by the House com-
mittee last week showed on the day of 
insurrection, he still refused to say the 
election is over. This little man just 
can’t bring himself to accept reality. 
Wisconsin’s Assembly Speaker, who 
happens to be a Republican, said Don-
ald Trump called him to urge him to 
overturn the State’s vote in the 2020 
election. When did he call him? Two 
weeks ago. He is still on a rampage. 
The Senate will soon consider a bi-
partisan Electoral Count Reform Act 
to make it plain that a Presidential 
election 
cannot 
be 
overturned 
by 
wrongful partisan interference by a 
Vice President or any State or congres-
sional officials. I support this effort. 
Senators KLOBUCHAR, KING, and I of-
fered our own ideas several months ago 
on this anticipated Electoral Count 
Act reform. I hope that this bipartisan 
effort can get 60 votes in the Senate. 
I hope that 10 Republicans will join 
us in modernizing this law so it works 
for today. It was written in haste in 
the middle of political controversy in 
the 19th century. Some of the sections 
of that law are almost unintelligible. 
Let’s clarify it. Let’s give the Amer-
ican people an assurance that we 
learned a lesson on January 6, 2021, and 
in the election that preceded it. And in 
that lesson, we learned that the Amer-
ican people want their votes to count 
accurately, honestly, and fairly. 
Ultimately, however, the only way 
we can protect our elections and our 
democracy is by respecting the rule of 
law and the will of the American peo-
ple and telling them the truth. By lay-
ing out the truth clearly for the Amer-
ican people and for history, the Janu-
ary 6 Committee is performing an in-
valuable public service. They deserve 
our respect. 
One closing comment. There wasn’t 
supposed to be a committee in the 
House. Madam President, you remem-
ber and I do, too, the proposal was for 
a bipartisan Commission to be created 
to investigate this travesty on January 
6 as they investigated 9/11—take poli-
tics out of it, take elected officials out 
of it, bring together people who are re-
spected from across the political spec-
trum, and get to the bottom of it. That 
proposal for a bipartisan Commission 
was stopped by Republican leadership 
in the House and the Senate. After all 
of the statements they made express-
ing outrage over January 6, when it 
came time to appoint the Commis-
sion—bipartisan Commission—they re-
fused. There is only one conclusion you 
can draw: They don’t want to face the 
truth. They don’t want the truth to be 
on the record from a bipartisan Com-
mission. Luckily, in the House of Rep-
resentatives, the January 6 Committee 
has achieved that, and there is more to 
come. 
I might add, people say: Why didn’t 
the Senate Judiciary Committee take 
this on? That is a very valid question. 
The difference is this. In order to issue 
a subpoena from the Senate Judiciary 
Committee in such a committee hear-
ing, we need to have agreement from at 
least one Republican member of the 
committee. We had no assurance that 
that agreement would be offered. So I 
supported the January 6 Committee in 
the House, and I am glad that they 
moved forward as they have. 
ABORTION 
Madam President, it was a month 
ago the Dobbs decision was handed 
down. One of the most controversial 
issues in American politics is the issue 
of abortion and reproductive health. 
We know that Justice Alito’s opin-
ion, a 6-to-3 decision, overturned Roe v. 
Wade. Since then, we have been trying 
to sort out the impact of that decision 
on America. There are many things 
that have happened which have been 
shocking—the fact that they have 
called into question some of the things 
that we had accepted for 50 years as 
constitutionally guaranteed rights. 
Yes, there was a 10-year-old girl who 
was viciously raped and turned up 
pregnant in the State of Ohio. And, 
yes, under the law in the State of Ohio 
because she was 6 weeks 3 days preg-
nant, she couldn’t qualify for a proce-
dure to terminate her pregnancy in the 
State of Ohio. She had to go to Indi-
ana, the neighboring State. There were 
those who disputed that it ever hap-
pened and denied that such a thing 
could occur. As it turned out, they 
were wrong. It did happen. I was sad-
dened to read that one of the leaders in 
the right to life movement said she 
should carry that baby to term—a 10- 
year-old girl. 
Madam President, I am sure you have 
seen a lot of 10-year-old young people. 
I have seen them, too, even in my 
household, one of my grandchildren. At 
that age, you are still questioning 
whether they can cross a busy street 
without help. And to think someone 
would say she should carry that baby 
to term ignores her own health and ig-
nores the reality of that situation. 
That is the kind of rhetoric we are 
hearing from people who are proposing 
a national ban on abortions. 
I was reading this morning an article 
in the New York Times. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have this New York Times 
article printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AFTER ROE, URGENT QUESTIONS ABOUT 
CANCER CARE 
(By Gina Kolata) 
In April of last year, Rachel Brown’s 
oncologist called with bad news—at age 36, 
she had an aggressive form of breast cancer. 
The very next day, she found out she was 
pregnant after nearly a year of trying with 
her fiance´ to have a baby. 
She had always said she would never have 
an abortion. But the choices she faced were 
wrenching. If she had the chemotherapy that 
she needed to prevent the spread of her can-
cer, she could harm her baby. If she didn’t 
have it, the cancer could spread and kill her. 
She had two children, ages 2 and 11, who 
could lose their mother. 
For Ms. Brown and others in the unlucky 
sorority of women who receive a cancer diag-
nosis when they are pregnant, the Supreme

July 25, 2022 
Court decision in June, ending the constitu-
tional right to an abortion, can seem like a 
slap in the face. If the life of a fetus is para-
mount, a pregnancy can mean a woman can-
not get effective treatment for her cancer. 
One in a thousand women who gets pregnant 
each year is diagnosed with cancer, meaning 
thousands of women are facing a serious and 
possibly fatal disease while they are expect-
ing a baby. 
Before the Supreme Court decision, a preg-
nant woman with cancer was already ‘‘enter-
ing a world with tremendous unknowns,’’ 
said Dr. Clifford Hudis, the chief executive 
officer at the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology. Now, not only the women but also 
the doctors and hospitals that treat them, 
are caught up in the added complications of 
abortion bans. 
‘‘If a doctor can’t give a drug without fear 
of damaging a fetus, is that going to com-
promise outcomes?’’ Dr. Hudis asked. ‘‘It’s a 
whole new world.’’ 
Cancer drugs are dangerous for fetuses in 
the first trimester. Although older chemo-
therapy drugs are safe in the second and 
third trimesters, the safety of the newer and 
more effective drugs is unknown and doctors 
are reluctant to give them to pregnant 
women. 
About 40 percent of women who are preg-
nant and have cancer have breast cancer. 
But other cancers also occur in pregnant 
women, including blood cancers, cervical and 
ovarian 
cancer, 
gastrointestinal 
cancer, 
melanoma, brain cancer, thyroid cancer and 
pancreatic cancer. 
Women with some types of cancer, like 
acute leukemia, often can’t continue with a 
pregnancy if the cancer is diagnosed in the 
first trimester. They need to be treated im-
mediately, within days, and the necessary 
drugs are toxic to a fetus. 
‘‘In my view, the only medically accept-
able option is termination of the pregnancy 
so that lifesaving treatment can be adminis-
tered to the mother,’’ said Dr. Eric Winer, 
the director of the Yale Cancer Center. 
Some oncologists say they are not sure 
what is allowed if a woman lives in a state 
like 
Michigan, 
which 
has 
a 
law 
that 
criminalized most abortions but permits 
them to save the life of the mother. Does 
leukemia qualify as a reason for an abortion 
to save her life? 
‘‘It’s so early we don’t know the answer,’’ 
said Dr. N. Lynn Henry, an oncologist at the 
University of Michigan. ‘‘We can’t prove that 
the drugs caused a problem for the baby, and 
we can’t prove that withholding the drugs 
would have a negative outcome.’’ 
In other words, doctors say, complications 
from a pregnancy—a miscarriage, a pre-
mature birth, birth defects or death—can 
occur whether or not a woman with cancer 
takes the drugs. If she is not treated and her 
cancer gallops into a malignancy that kills 
her, that too might have happened even if 
she had been given the cancer drugs. 
Administrators of the University of Michi-
gan’s medical system are not intervening in 
cancer treatment decisions about how to 
treat cancers in pregnant women, saying 
‘‘medical decision making and management 
is between doctors and patients.’’ 
I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor and 
bioethicist at Harvard, is gravely concerned. 
‘‘We are putting physicians in a terrible 
position,’’ Mr. Cohen said. ‘‘I don’t think 
signing up to be a physician should mean 
signing up to do jail time,’’ he added. 
Oncologists usually are part of a hospital 
system, Mr. Cohen said, which adds a further 
complication for doctors who treat cancers 
in states that ban abortions. ‘‘Whatever 
their personal feelings,’’ he asked, ‘‘what are 
the risks the hospital system is going to 
face?’’ 
‘‘I don’t think oncologists ever thought 
this day was coming for them,’’ Mr. Cohen 
said. 
Behind the confusion and concern from 
doctors are the stories of women like Ms. 
Brown. 
She had a large tumor in her left breast 
and cancer cells in her underarm lymph 
nodes. The cancer was HER2 positive. Such 
cancers can spread quickly without treat-
ment. About 15 years ago, the prognosis for 
women with HER2 positive cancers was 
among the worst breast cancer prognosis. 
Then a targeted treatment, trastuzumab, or 
Herceptin, completely changed the picture. 
Now women with HER2 tumors have among 
the best prognoses compared with other 
breast cancers. 
But trastuzumab cannot be given during 
pregnancy. 
Ms. Brown’s first visit was with a surgical 
oncologist who, she said, ‘‘made it clear that 
my life would be in danger if I kept my preg-
nancy because I wouldn’t be able to be treat-
ed until the second trimester.’’ He told her 
that if she waited for those months her can-
cer could spread to distant organs and would 
become fatal. 
Her treatment in the second trimester 
would be a mastectomy with removal of all 
of the lymph nodes in her left armpit, which 
would have raised her risk of lymphedema, 
an incurable fluid buildup in her arm. She 
could start chemotherapy in her second tri-
mester but could not have trastuzumab or 
radiation treatment. 
Her next consult was with Dr. Lisa Carey, 
a breast cancer specialist at the University 
of North Carolina, who told her that while 
she could have a mastectomy in the first tri-
mester, before chemotherapy, it was not op-
timal. Ordinarily, oncologists would give 
cancer drugs before a mastectomy to shrink 
the tumor, allowing for a less invasive sur-
gery. If the treatment did not eradicate the 
tumor, oncologists would try a more aggres-
sive drug treatment after the operation. 
But if she had a mastectomy before having 
chemotherapy, it would be impossible to 
know if the treatment was helping. And 
what if the drugs were not working? She 
worried that her cancer could become fatal 
without her knowing it. 
She feared that if she tried to keep her 
pregnancy, she might sacrifice her own life 
and destroy the lives of her children. And if 
she delayed making her decision and then 
had an abortion later in the pregnancy, she 
feared that the fetus might feel pain. 
She and her fiance´ discussed her options. 
This pregnancy would be his first biological 
child. 
With enormous sadness, they made their 
decision—she would have a medication abor-
tion. She took the pills one morning when 
she was six weeks and one day pregnant, and 
cried all day. She wrote a eulogy for the 
baby who might have been. She was con-
vinced the baby was going to be a girl, and 
had 
named 
her 
Hope. 
She 
saved 
the 
ultrasound of Hope’s heartbeat. 
‘‘I don’t take that little life lightly,’’ Ms. 
Brown said. 
After she terminated her pregnancy, Ms. 
Brown was able to start treatment with 
trastuzumab, along with a cocktail of chem-
otherapy drugs and radiation. She had a 
mastectomy, and there was no evidence of 
cancer at the time of her surgery—a great 
prognostic sign, Dr. Carey said. She did not 
need to have all of her lymph nodes removed 
and did not develop lymphedema. 
‘‘I feel like it has taken a lot of courage to 
do what I did,’’ Ms. Brown said. ‘‘As a moth-
er your first instinct is to protect the baby.’’ 
But having gone through that grueling 
treatment, she also wondered how she could 
ever have handled having a newborn baby 
and her two other children to care for. 
‘‘My bones ached. I couldn’t walk more 
than a few steps without being out of breath. 
It was hard to get nutrients because of the 
nausea and vomiting,’’ she said. 
The Supreme Court decision hit her hard. 
‘‘I felt like the reason I did what I did 
didn’t matter,’’ she said. ‘‘My life didn’t 
matter, and my children’s lives didn’t mat-
ter.’’ 
‘‘It didn’t matter if I lost my life because 
I was being forced to be pregnant,’’ she said. 
Mr. DURBIN. I want to read this be-
cause it tells you the complications 
that have been created by what seemed 
like a very simple decision overturning 
a previous Supreme Court case. This 
writer, Gina Kolata, wrote an article 
entitled ‘‘After Roe, Urgent Questions 
About Cancer Care.’’ It was in Sunday’s 
New York Times, July 24, 2022. I was 
struck by this article because it sug-
gests the complexity of this issue and 
the real-world impact of this decision: 
In April of last year, Rachel Brown’s 
oncologist called with bad news—at age 36, 
she had an aggressive form of breast cancer. 
The very next day, she found out she was 
pregnant after nearly a year of trying with 
her fiance to have a baby. 
She had always said she would never have 
an abortion. But the choices she faced were 
wrenching. If she had the chemotherapy that 
she needed to prevent the spread of her can-
cer, she could harm the baby. If she didn’t 
have it, the cancer could spread and kill her. 
She had two children, ages 2 and 11, who 
would lose their mother. 
For Ms. Brown and others in the unlucky 
sorority of women who receive a cancer diag-
nosis when they are pregnant, the Supreme 
Court decision in [Dobbs], ending the con-
stitutional right to an abortion, can seem 
like a slap in the face. If the life of a fetus 
is paramount, a pregnancy can mean a 
woman cannot get effective treatment for 
her cancer. One in a thousand women who 
gets pregnant each year is diagnosed with 
cancer, meaning thousands of women are fac-
ing a serious and possibly fatal disease while 
they are expecting a baby. 
Before the Supreme Court decision, a preg-
nant woman with cancer was already ‘‘enter-
ing a world with tremendous unknowns,’’ 
said Dr. Clifford Hudis, the chief executive 
officer at the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology. Now, not only the women but also 
the doctors and hospitals that treat them,

therapy drugs are safe in the second and

This woman decided to terminate her 
pregnancy, take the cancer therapy, 
and save her life. She closes with the

matter, and my children’s lives didn’t mat-
ter. 
‘‘It didn’t matter if I lost my life because 
I was being forced to be pregnant,’’ she said. 
That is the reality today. I hear my 
colleagues come to the floor with abso-
lute certain moral clarity on this issue. 
I have learned during the course of my 
life and my public life that there is not 
that element of certainty when it 
comes down to real life. And to jeop-
ardize the health and safety, even the 
life of the mother in this circumstance, 
to leave doctors wondering if they have 
criminal liability for professional med-
ical care is something this Nation 
should never see. But we face it now, 
and it is up to us to show leadership 
and come together, I hope, and bring 
back the constitutional protections 
that have been the case for 50 years in 
this country. 
I yield the floor.

CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as I 
was preparing to come to the floor, I 
was going to say we are going to have 
a vote tonight to proceed to fill a 
major gap in our national security, al-
though it looks like Mother Nature and 
the weather may prevent a vote to-
night, and it may be tomorrow. But, 
still, I expect in the next couple of days 
for us to address a major gap in our na-
tional security. 
More than a year and a half after the 
original CHIPS Act became law, we are 
finally approaching the finish line in 
the race to fund it. 
You may recall that it was June of 
2020 that Senator WARNER, the senior 
Senator, a Democrat from Virginia, 
and I introduced the CHIPS for Amer-
ica Act to address a frightening supply 
chain vulnerability when it comes to 
the most advanced semiconductors in 
the world, 90 percent of which come 
from Asia, and 60 percent come from 
Taiwan. 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin re-
cently wrote a letter to congressional 
leaders 
saying 
that 
‘‘funding 
the 
CHIPS Act is critical to our national 
defense,’’ and last week, former Sec-
retary of State and CIA Director Mike 
Pompeo also urged Congress to pass 
this funding, saying: 
The cost of compromise on this bill pales 
in comparison to the costs we will suffer if 
we allow the Chinese Communist Party to 
one day own and control access to our most 
critical technologies. 
I agree with both of these state-
ments, one by a Democrat appointee, 
another by a Republican appointee. 
Chips underpin virtually all the tech-
nology that we use that keeps us safe 
at home and protects our troops 
around the world. And for those not 
conversant with the role semiconduc-
tors play, these microprocessors under-
pin literally everything that has an off- 
and-on switch, and obviously our de-
pendency on that kind of technology 
will do nothing but increase in the 
days and months and years ahead. 
From our major military assets, like 
the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter, to ev-
eryday technologies that keep our 
troops safe, like advanced body armor, 
semiconductors are key. Keeping a 
ready and dependable supply chain of 
these defense assets requires a lot of 
semiconductors, and right now, we are 
mainly looking to other countries to 
manufacture them. 
As a matter of fact, the United 
States of America makes zero percent 
of the most advanced semiconductors 
in the world. We depend on outsourcing 
virtually all of the manufacturing to 
other countries and produce none of 
them here. Roughly 75 percent of the 
semiconductor manufacturing globally 
is concentrated in China and East Asia, 
and 100 percent of the world’s most ad-
vanced chipmaking capacity is located 
in only two places—Taiwan and South 
Korea. As I said, Taiwan commands 92 
percent 
of 
the 
world’s 
advanced 
chipmaking, and the United States 
makes zero. 
You might wonder, How did we find 
ourselves in this situation? Well, I 
think it was probably the supply chain 
vulnerabilities 
that 
we 
saw 
from 
COVID–19 that called into question this 
assumption that just because some-
thing could be made cheaper some-
where else in the world, that that nec-
essarily checked all the boxes. Well, it 
does if all you are depending on is 
China to make toys for our children or 
other nonessential items, but when you 
are talking about the very brains be-
hind the technology we need, ranging 
from our cell phone, as I said, to our 
most sophisticated military weapons, 
it does not check all the boxes to say 
we will just import those from abroad, 
where they can be made cheaper, be-
cause that vulnerable supply chain, if 
disrupted, could cause not only a se-
vere economic depression in America 
but also threaten our national security 
directly. 
If access to those chips were cut off 
or restricted, we would be up a creek 
without a paddle. We couldn’t produce 
a stockpile of Javelin missiles to sup-
ply Ukraine or produce the radios and 
communications devices that keep our 
troops and our allies connected. That is 
why shoring up this domestic supply, 
this manufacturing capacity, is a key 
national security priority, and this is 
the best way to protect one of our most 
critical supply chains and ensure our 
military readiness will not be com-
promised by the People’s Republic of 
China 
or 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, which has threatened, by the 
way, to invade Taiwan, where the vast 
majority 
of 
these 
advanced 
semi-
conductors are made. But it wouldn’t 
necessarily require a military inter-
vention. It could be another pandemic, 
it could be a natural disaster—any-
thing that might block our access to 
these advanced semiconductors. 
While closing that national security 
gap is the top priority here, we can’t 
ignore major economic consequences 
that this legislation will deliver as 
well. 
When I introduced this legislation 
with Senator WARNER from Virginia, 
who is chairman of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, on which I also 
serve, our focus was on national secu-
rity. Obviously, many of our States 
will be winners when it comes to the 
economic consequences of this legisla-
tion as well. Texas has been, for exam-
ple, a longstanding leader in the semi-
conductor industry and is home to 
more than 200 chip manufacturing fa-
cilities that employ 29,000 Texans. For 
years, our State has reaped the bene-
fits of semiconductor manufacturing. 
Most of these are what are called leg-
acy chips. They are the older chips 
where you are not as concerned about 
miniaturization 
or 
compactness 
or 
power—things that, for example, run 
our refrigerators or TV sets or other 
consumer electronics or maybe even 
our cars. 
We are already seeing the types of in-
vestments that this chips bill will fi-
nally bring. Earlier this summer, Texas 
Instruments, in the metroplex in Dal-
las-Fort Worth, broke ground on the 
first of four new fabs in Sherman, TX, 
about an hour north of Dallas. This is 
part of a $30 billion investment that is 
expected to create some 3,000 more 
jobs. The mayor of Sherman, where 
this is located in Northeast Texas, de-
scribed it as ‘‘a watershed day,’’ noting 
that ‘‘it’s hard to have a frame of ref-
erence for a $30 billion investment in a 
town of 50,000 people.’’ 
Sherman isn’t the only town in Texas 
preparing for a major chips boom. Last 
fall, I joined leaders from Samsung—a 
South Korean company with a large fa-
cility already in Austin, TX—when 
they announced a $17 billion additional 
investment in a new chip fab in Taylor, 
TX, just outside of Austin. That facil-
ity is expected to directly create more 
than 2,000 high-tech jobs, as well as 
thousands of other related jobs, once it 
is operational because these fabs, or 
manufacturing facilities, are not stand- 
alone; they are part of what ultimately 
will become an ecosystem of suppliers 
and other affiliated industries that will 
be built up around them, creating 
thousands more jobs. 
But we also learned from Samsung 
that they are not likely to stop there if 
we pass this CHIPS for America fund-
ing this week. Samsung is currently 
considering whether to expand its in-
vestment to include 11 new chipmaking 
facilities in Central Texas. 
If it moves forward with this plan, 
which, again, depends on our passage of 
this legislation this week, it could lead 
to nearly $200 billion in additional in-
vestments and create 10,000 jobs. 
I know that is tough to comprehend— 
the economic growth and sweeping ben-
efits that would come with a $200 bil-
lion investment and 10,000 new jobs; 
but as exciting as these potential in-
vestments are, there is something even 
better. This is just the beginning. 
Companies around the world are eye-
ing Texas and the United States for 
new investments in chipmaking. Ap-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3625 
July 25, 2022 
Infineon, GlobalWafers, GlobiTech, and 
a number of other companies are look-
ing at building or expanding their fa-
cilities in Texas or other parts of the 
country. 
GlobalFoundries, for example, is in-
vesting $1 billion to boost production 
in New York. Intel plans to build a $20- 
billion facility of two fabs in Ohio. And 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company—TSMC, as it is called—is 
building a $12-billion plant in Arizona. 
They have already broken ground on 
that plant, but they made it clear that 
their willingness to make that invest-
ment and complete that fab will de-
pend on our passage of the CHIPS for 
America Act. 
And once this legislation passes, I ex-
pect more good news to follow. This is 
not just good news for our individual 
States, but also for our national econ-
omy and our global competitiveness. 
We are not used to providing these 
kinds of financial incentives to busi-
nesses, but when it costs 30 percent less 
to build these manufacturing facilities 
across the seas in Asia and our access 
to that supply chain is potentially 
jeopardized by very real threats, it is a 
necessary investment for us to make. 
And we are seeing other places around 
the world providing similar incentives, 
for example, in the European Union. 
But that doesn’t necessarily solve our 
supply chain problem. We need the jobs 
and that investment here in America 
for us to be truly safe and secure and to 
reap the economic benefits of this in-
vestment. 
On the economic front, this funding 
has the support of many groups on the 
outside, including the bipartisan sup-
port that I mentioned earlier; in my 
State, the Texas Association of Busi-
ness; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
for example; and we have heard from 
the National Governors Association, 
which is a bipartisan organization of 
U.S. Governors; as well as the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors, which represent 
State and local leaders across the 
country. 
My 
Governor, 
Governor 
Abbott, 
called this bill ‘‘an opportunity to lock 
even greater economic potential.’’ 
So I am proud to support this legisla-
tion. After all this time, I will be espe-
cially glad when the finish line is in 
sight and we cross it successfully later 
this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
like the Senator from Texas, I wish to 
speak about the so-called chips bill, 
but my perspective is, to say the least, 
a little bit different. 
To my mind, what the chips bill rep-
resents is the question of whether or 
not we will have priorities in this coun-
try that represent the needs of working 
families and the middle class or wheth-
er this institution, the entire Congress, 
is totally beholden to wealthy and pow-
erful corporate interests. 
I do not argue with anyone who 
makes the point that there is a global 
shortage 
in 
microchips 
and 
semi-
conductors, which is making it harder 
for manufacturers to produce the cars, 
the cell phones, the household appli-
ances, and the electronic equipment 
that we need. This shortage is, in fact, 
costing American workers good-paying 
jobs and raising prices for families. 
And that is why I personally strongly 
support 
the 
need 
to 
expand 
U.S. 
microchip production. 
But the question that we should be 
asking is this: Should American tax-
payers provide the microchip industry 
with a blank check—blank check—of 
over $76 billion at the same exact time 
when semiconductor companies are 
making tens of billions of dollars in 
profits and paying their CEOs exorbi-
tant compensation packages? 
That really is one of the questions 
that we should be asking, and I think 
the answer to that is a resounding no. 
This is an enormously profitable indus-
try. 
According to an Associated Press ar-
ticle that I read today, Senator ROM-
NEY, reflecting the views, I think, of 
many—I think Senator CORNYN made 
the same point—but Senator ROMNEY 
was quoted as saying that when other 
countries subsidize the manufacturing 
of high technology chips, the United 
States must join the club—must join 
the club. 
‘‘If you don’t play like they play, 
then you are not going to be manufac-
turing high technology chips, and they 
are essential for our national defense 
as well as our economy,’’ Senator ROM-
NEY said. 
Now, I find the position of Senator 
ROMNEY and others to be really quite 
interesting because I personally have 
been on this floor many, many times 
urging the Senate to look to other 
countries around the world and learn 
from those countries. And what I have 
said is that it is a bit absurd that here 
in the United States we are the only 
major country on Earth not to guar-
antee healthcare to all of their people. 
And Senator ROMNEY says ‘‘join the 
club,’’ and I agree. Let’s join the club 
and not spend twice as much per capita 
on healthcare as the Canadians, as the 
British, as the French. Let’s join that 
club and guarantee healthcare to all 
people, rather than making the insur-
ance companies billions in profits 
every single year. 
Senator 
ROMNEY
says 
‘‘join 
the 
club,’’ and I agree. We should join the 
club in terms of higher education. Ger-
many 
today, 
and 
other 
countries 
around the world, make sure that their 
young people can go to their colleges 
and universities tuition-free so that 
they don’t have to leave school 40, 50, 
or $100,000 in debt. Let’s join the club. 
Let’s do what Germany and other 
countries are doing, which makes emi-
nent sense in every sense of the word. 
Let’s guarantee the right of all of our 
kids, regardless of their income, to get 
a higher education. Let’s join the club. 
And there is another club that I 
think we might want to join, among 
many others. We are the only major 
country—virtually the only country on 
Earth—that does not guarantee paid 
family and medical leave. There are 
women today in the United States of 
America having a baby, and they will 
be back at work in a week because they 
need the income—no guaranteed paid 
family medical leave. There are people 
getting fired today because their kids 
are sick. They have to make the choice 
whether they hang on to their jobs or 
take care of their sick kids. 
Let’s join the club. Let’s do what not 
only every major country on Earth 
does in terms of guaranteed paid fam-
ily and medical, but what virtually all 
countries, including some of the poor-
est, in the world do. 
But I gather the problem is that to 
join those clubs in terms of universal 
healthcare, in terms of paid family and 
medical leave, in terms of free tuition 
and public colleges and universities, we 
are going to have to take on powerful 
special interests, and they make cam-
paign contributions. And that is not 
what the Senate does. 
When it comes to joining the club 
with other countries giving blank 
checks to large corporations, that is a 
club that, unfortunately, many of my 
colleagues here feel comfortable in 
joining. 
So, 
apparently, 
when 
corporate 
America needs a blank check of $76 bil-
lion, we do what other countries are 
doing. 
There is a lot of talk about the 
microchip crisis facing this country 
but, amazingly enough, very little dis-
cussion about how we got to where we 
are today. One might ask: OK, if there 
is a crisis, how did it happen? Well, 
let’s review some recent history. This 
is really quite amazing. 
Over the last 20 years, the microchip 
industry has shut down over 780 manu-
facturing plants and other establish-
ments in the United States and elimi-
nated 150,000 American jobs while mov-
ing most of its production overseas. 
And, by the way, they did that after 
they received a Federal grant and loans 
much smaller than what we are talking 
about today. 
So here is the absurd situation that 
we are in. The crisis is caused by the 
industry shutting down in America and 
moving abroad. And today, what we are 
doing is saying: We are going to give 
you a blank check to undo the damage 
that you did. 
Let me just give you a few examples. 
We don’t have a whole lot of informa-
tion on this. Between 2010 and 2014, 
Intel laid off approximately 1,400 work-
ers from the Rio Rancho, NM, chip fa-
cility and offshored 1,000 jobs to Israel. 
According to the Oregon Bureau of 
Labor and Industry, Intel laid off more 
than 1,000 workers in Oregon between 
2015 
and 
2016. 
Texas 
Instruments 
outsourced 400 jobs from their Houston 
manufacturing facility to the Phil-
ippines in 2013. Micron Technology has 
repeatedly cut jobs in Boise, ID, includ-
ing 1,100 in 2003 and another 1,100 in

S3626 
July 25, 2022 
2007; 1,500 in 2008; and in 2009, the com-
pany 
stopped 
manufacturing 
some 
types of chips entirely and laid off 2,000 
workers. 
In other words, in order to make 
more profits, these companies took 
government money and used it to ship 
good-paying jobs abroad. Now as their 
reward for causing the crisis that we 
are in, these same companies are in 
line to receive a massive taxpayer 
handout to undo the damage they did. 
Wow, that is a heck of a policy. You 
bribe companies to undo the damage 
that they caused. 
It is estimated in total that five 
major semiconductor companies will 
receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer 
handout: Intel, Texas Instruments, Mi-
cron Technology, Global Boundaries, 
and Samsung. These five companies 
alone made $70 billion in profits. 
You know, I find it interesting. I 
have heard Senators here on the floor 
talk about entitlements. When we help 
working people, when we help poor peo-
ple, there are all kinds of require-
ments—work requirements, reporting 
requirements, drug testing require-
ments, you name the requirements 
when the Federal Government helps 
working people or low-income people. 
Well, what are the requirements at-
tached to this handout for large profit-
able corporations? The answer is zero. 
The company that will likely benefit 
the most from this taxpayer assistance 
is Intel. In 2021, last year, Intel made 
nearly $20 billion in profits. 
You know, it just does astound me. 
You have heard people come to the 
floor and say: We can’t help working 
parents with their kids. We don’t be-
lieve in those entitlement programs. 
We can’t guarantee healthcare to all 
people. We are not an ‘‘entitlement so-
ciety.’’ But a company that, last year, 
made $20 billion in profits, they are en-
titled to what we estimate will be be-
tween $20 and $30 billion in Federal 
funding. During the pandemic and dur-
ing the last several years, Intel had 
enough money to spend $16.6 billion not 
on research and development, not on 
building new plants in America but on 
buying back its own stock to reward 
its 
executives 
and 
wealthy 
share-
holders. So here is the absurd moment 
that we are in. As I mentioned a mo-
ment ago, it is estimated that Intel 
will receive between $20 and $30 billion 
in Federal funding. Yet, within the last 
several years, the same company spent 
over $16 billion on stock buybacks, and 
there is no guarantee in this bill that 
they and other companies that receive 
these grants will not continue to do 
stock buybacks. 
This is the way a corrupt political 
system works, and I hope everybody 
understands it. 
Over the past 20 years, Intel has 
spent over $100 million on lobbying and 
campaign contributions. That is a lot 
of money, $100 million, but this is what 
a corrupt political system is about. For 
$100 million in lobbying and campaign 
contributions, they are going to get at 
least $20 billion in corporate welfare. 
That, I would argue, is a pretty good 
investment. That is what goes on here 
not only with the microchip industry 
but with the pharmaceutical industry, 
the fossil fuel industry, the insurance 
industry—huge amounts of money in 
lobbying and campaign contributions. 
The pharmaceutical industry has 1,500 
paid lobbyists right now, right here in 
Washington, DC, which is why we pay 
the highest prices in the world for pre-
scription drugs. 
I find this extraordinary. Maybe I am 
the only person here who does, but, to 
me, it is rather amazing. 
A little over a week ago, the CEO of 
Intel, 
a 
gentleman 
named 
Pat 
Gelsinger, who earns something like 
$179 million a year in compensation— 
not a bad salary—did an interview on 
CNBC’s ‘‘Squawk Box’’ program. I 
think to listen to that interview tells 
us everything we need to know about 
oligarchy and arrogance and the state 
of American politics. 
This is what Mr. Gelsinger said on 
TV. I love this. 
My message— 
Mr. Gelsinger’s message— 
to congressional leaders is ‘‘Hey, if I’m not 
done with the job, I don’t get to go home. 
Neither should you. Do not go home for Au-
gust recess until you have passed the CHIPS 
Act. Because— 
Now listen to this— 
‘‘I and others in the industry will make in-
vestment decisions. And do you want those 
investments in the U.S. or are we simply not 
competitive enough to do them here and 
we’’— 
The industry— 
‘‘need to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get 
the job done. Do not go home for August re-
cess without getting these bills passed.’’ 
In other words, what he is telling you 
is, point blank, who is the puppet and 
who is the puppeteer. Don’t go home 
this August until you give us $76 bil-
lion because, if you don’t do that, we 
are going to go to Asia, and we are 
going to go to Europe. 
That is the state of American poli-
tics—and not only of American poli-
tics, I would say. It is equally true in 
other countries that are also held hos-
tage by large, multinational corpora-
tions. 
Let us be clear. The CEO of Intel is 
saying, if you don’t give his industry a 
$76 billion blank check and his par-
ticular company up to $30 billion, that 
despite, no doubt, their profound love 
for America—I am sure they have got 
big American flags all over the place 
and their patriotism and their concern 
for the needs of the military and the 
healthcare industry, which, in fact, 
need these sophisticated chips. If we do 
not give them this bribe despite their 
love of America and their concern 
about our national defense—you heard 
Senator CORNYN talking about national 
defense, and he is right in that this is 
a national defense issue. Despite all of 
that and all of their love for America, 
they are willing to go to Asia and go to 
Europe in order to make even more 
money. 
As I said last week, I am, thankfully, 
not a lawyer, but that sure sounds like 
extortion to me. Mr. Gelsinger’s words 
sure sound like extortion. What he is 
saying is, if you don’t give his industry 
$76 billion, they are out. They are not 
going to build in the United States, 
and they are going to go abroad. 
So I have a few questions for Mr. 
Gelsinger and the other microchip 
CEOs. 
If Intel and the others receive a cor-
porate welfare check from the tax-
payers of America, are they willing to 
commit today that they will not 
outsource American jobs overseas? Yes 
or no? 
If this legislation passes, will Intel 
and the others commit today that they 
will not spend another penny on stock 
buybacks to enrich wealthy share-
holders but will, instead, spend that 
money to create jobs in the United 
States? 
If this legislation goes into effect, 
will Intel and the others commit today 
that they will stay neutral in any 
union organizing campaign, like the 
one being waged at Intel’s microchip 
plant in Hillsboro, OR? 
If this legislation goes into effect, 
will Intel and the others commit today 
that they are prepared to issue war-
rants for the Federal Government so 
that the taxpayers of America get a 
reasonable return on their invest-
ments? 
These grants are going to provide a 
whole lot of profit for these companies. 
It seems to me the taxpayers should 
benefit as well. 
If Intel and the others were prepared 
to say yes to any of these questions, I 
don’t think that they would be lob-
bying against my amendment to im-
pose these very same conditions to this 
legislation. 
Let me simply conclude by saying 
this: I worry not only about this bill; I 
worry about the precedent that it 
states, that it allows. What the prece-
dent is, is that any company that is 
prepared to go abroad and that has ig-
nored the needs of the American people 
will then say to the Congress: Hey, if 
you want us to stay here, you had bet-
ter give us a handout. 
We manufacture virtually all of our 
laptop computers in China. We manu-
facture virtually all of our cell phones 
in China. Pass this legislation, and I 
expect all of these guys and others will 
be back here, saying: We want for our 
industry 
what 
you 
did 
for 
the 
microchip industry. 
So the bottom line is here: Yes, we 
need to rebuild the microchip industry 
in the United States but not as a hand-
out. Let us sit down and work on intel-
ligent industrial policy. Let us work on 
a series of agreements that protect the 
American 
taxpayer 
and 
American 
workers and not just wealthy stock-
holders. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3627 
July 25, 2022 
forward to end the debate on the bipar-
tisan chips and innovation bill. Unfor-
tunately, a number of severe thunder-
storms on the East Coast have dis-
rupted the travel plans of a significant 
number of Senators. To give Members a 
chance to get back into town safely, I 
am going to delay tonight’s vote on the 
bipartisan chips and innovation bill 
until tomorrow morning. I remain 
hopeful that we can remain on track to 
finish this legislation ASAP. 
PACT ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, in the meantime, I 
will now file cloture on another bill 
that will dramatically improve the 
lives of millions of American veterans, 
the PACT Act, which, when signed into 
law, will be one of the biggest expan-
sions of veterans’ healthcare benefits 
in decades. 
As my colleagues already know, be-
cause of a technical error, the House of 
Representatives was unable to take up 
our version of this bill that we passed 
in the spring. The House has now fixed 
their error and has returned the PACT 
Act back to the Senate. By filing clo-
ture, we should be able to pass this bi-
partisan piece of legislation before the 
week is done. 
Our nation’s veterans have waited 
long enough to get the benefits they 
need to treat complications from toxic 
exposure in the line of duty. So we 
have every reason in the world to get 
this bill done with the same bipartisan 
support as the first time around. 
Again, I want to thank particularly 
Senators TESTER and MORAN, who led 
the way to pass this bill earlier this 
year, thank all of our colleagues and 
our veterans and veterans service orga-
nizations for helping push this bill 
through Congress. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—H.R. 4346 
Madam President, now I ask unani-
mous consent that notwithstanding 
rule XXII, the cloture vote with re-
spect to H.R. 4346 occur at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader, fol-
lowing consultation with the Repub-
lican leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. For the information 
of the Senate, we expect the cloture 
vote with respect to the CHIPS and 
science legislation to occur around 11 
o’clock a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, July 
26. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, I have a cloture motion to the 
motion to concur at the desk.

ture motion having been presented 
under rule XXII, the Chair directs the 
clerk to read the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows:

and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 3359) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time,

f 
PACT ACT OF 2022—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I was 
in the Chamber and heard Senator 
SANDERS’ speech. I appreciate his pas-
sion about globalization and what he 
and I—it brought back—and I spoke to 
him after he spoke. It brought back to 
me the memories of standing shoulder 
to shoulder—he in his second term, I in 
my first—against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and then a few 
years later standing shoulder to shoul-
der with him in opposition to PNTR, 
Permanent Normal Trade Relations, 
with China. 
And we know what that meant, espe-
cially in my State and especially in the 
industrial Midwest, especially in places 
that the Presiding Officer represents 
and places like East St. Louis and 
downstate Illinois and so much of the 
industrial plants that were steel, espe-
cially east of Chicago and Indiana and 
Illinois. 
We are on the verge of a big win for 
Ohio, a win that will create jobs, will 
bring down prices, and bring home sup-
ply chains. 
As a kid growing up in Ohio, I walked 
the halls of Johnny Appleseed Junior 
High School with the sons and daugh-
ters of union workers: electricians, 
electrical workers at Westinghouse, 
sons and daughters of autoworkers 
from General Motors and machinists 
from Ohio Brass and carpenters and 
pipefitters and electricians who built 
our city and service these large compa-
nies. 
But by the time I graduated from 
Mansfield Senior High School, those 
plants were shutting down one after 
another. 
Why? 
Because 
corporate 
America wanted cheap labor. 
First, they went to anti-union States 
in the South. A plant might shut down 
in Mansfield or Barberton, OH, and 
move to Alabama; a plant might shut 
down in Shelby, OH, or Springfield, OH, 
and move to Georgia; a plant might 
shut down in Toledo or in Wadsworth, 
OH, and move to North Carolina or Ar-
kansas or Virginia. They went to anti- 
union States. They went to anti-union 
States with low wages. But do you 
know what? Then those CEOs, all pay-
ing themselves a really, really good in-
come, raising—you could see already, 
then, the average pay for a worker. In 
those days, when I was, I guess, in jun-
ior high school, a CEO made about—the 
plant manager made about 25 times 
what the worker made or even a small-
er proportion of that. Now it is hun-
dreds of times what workers make be-
cause 25 times what workers made just 
wasn’t enough for a lot of these compa-
nies. 
So then they shut down a lot of these 
factories in the anti-union, right-to- 
work South, and they moved to Mex-
ico. They wanted NAFTA to pass—the 
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment—so they could do it. They want-
ed 
PNTR—the 
Permanent 
Normal 
Trade Relations with China—to pass so 
they could go to China; always in the 
name of efficiency, always in the name 
of we have just got to be more effi-
cient, always in the name of efficiency. 
As you know, Madam President, ‘‘effi-
ciency’’ is business school speak for 
‘‘pay our workers less.’’ 
Those CEOs—and some of you re-
member these nicknames. These CEOs 
earned the names of ‘‘Chainsaw Al’’ 
and ‘‘John the Cutter’’ and ‘‘Larry the 
Knife’’ and ‘‘Neutron Jack.’’ To the 
CEOs themselves, they may kind of 
like those names, but they were not be-
stowed on them out of respect; they 
were given those nicknames because 
they were willing always to cut the pay 
of workers in Mansfield, OH, and hurt 
those families and partially destroy 
those communities. They were always 
willing to do that. So their companies 
made more money, and they got bigger 
paychecks, and all the executives in 
the corporate suites all did much, 
much better. The workers didn’t, the 
communities didn’t, but who really 
cared.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3628 
July 25, 2022 
They lobbied Congress to make out-
sourcing easier, and politicians were 
all too happy to do their bidding; first, 
with NAFTA, as I said, then Perma-
nent Normal Trade Relations with 
China. That transformation hollowed 
out manufacturing in Ohio and parts of 
the Presiding Officer’s State in Illinois 
throughout the Midwest, and then— 
here is where it hits us most poign-
antly in our face today—ended up with 
too long, too fragile supply chains that 
stretched all over the world. 
So, first, my friends’ families, my 
friends’ parents lost their jobs and 
ended up in jobs making a third less or 
half less, and the communities were 
never really—many of these commu-
nities never really recovered, these 
proud communities. But now, today, 
everyone is paying for those decisions 
to go overseas and to shut plants in 
Ohio and in the United States to go 
overseas. Now everyone is paying with 
higher prices. 
Why? A big reason for the inflation 
we see today is decades of offshoring 
our supply chains. We need to bring 
that production back home. 
That is what this bill is all about— 
investing more in America, making 
more in America, particularly the most 
critical inputs that cause the most 
problems right now, like semiconduc-
tors. 
Think about that. Think about these 
American companies. They were found-
ed in America. The investment, the re-
search was done in America, but think 
about this technology that started in 
this country, was probably patented in 
this country, was developed by Ameri-
cans or immigrants to our country, and 
got tax incentives from our country, 
but then these companies began to 
move offshore. 
Today, semiconductors that were in-
vented in the United States, 90 percent 
of them are made overseas. We only 
make 10 percent of semiconductors in 
this country. We make 10 percent of 
semiconductors, but we make zero per-
cent of the highest end semiconductors 
because these companies all thought, 
Well, there are more profits overseas. 
That is the hand we are dealt now. 
Over the past year, Ohio manufactur-
ers have faced severe shortages and 
long waits for semiconductors. Ford 
and GM plants in Ohio are forced to 
implement short-term plant closures 
because of chip shortages. 
Ohio manufacturers rely on semi-
conductors. They all suffer when there 
is a shortage. Let me just list some of 
these companies. I believe I have been 
in every one of these factories or these 
companies: Ford in Lima, OH, a city 
just like Mansfield where I grew up; 
Ford in Avon Lake, I used to live 3 
miles from that plant; Jeep in Toledo, 
my wife and I drive a Jeep made in 
America with union workers; Navistar 
in Springfield; Whirlpool in Clyde, I 
have been to that plant maybe five or 
six times, fought alongside them on en-
forcing trade rules; Kenworth in Chil-
licothe; GE in Evandale, near Cin-
cinnati; STERIS in Mentor; Nucor in 
Marion; ArcelorMittal in Cleveland; 
Cleveland-Cliffs 
in 
Toledo, 
in 
Coshocton, right across the river from 
Steubenville in Weirton, WV. Half the 
workers there are Ohioans. 
These businesses and their workers 
need chips. The United States invented 
the semiconductor. We started the in-
dustry. Ninety percent are made over-
seas. We allowed that to happen be-
cause of the corruption of this place, 
where people were happy to vote to 
give tax breaks to companies to move 
overseas for whatever reason. Too 
many Presidents, from Trump all the 
way back to Clinton, went along with 
those corporate interests as those com-
panies betrayed us and moved overseas. 
What does that mean today? It 
means 
higher 
prices; 
it 
means 
backorders; and it means we are all 
paying too much for too many prod-
ucts. 
The CHIPS Act is about reshoring 
those supply chains, investing in Ohio 
manufacturing, 
and 
bringing 
down 
prices for every American. 
It is not enough to invent technology 
here. We have seen it over and over. 
Take a look at the label on a phone, on 
any smartphone. It probably says ‘‘De-
veloped 
in 
California,’’ 
‘‘Made 
in 
China.’’ 
‘‘Developed 
in 
California,’’ 
that means the invention was in Cali-
fornia, the research was in California 
with U.S. investment of tax dollars, 
one way or the other, but then they 
made it in China. Why? Because they 
wanted cheap labor, and they can make 
more money by making it in China. 
Now they raise the price because the 
supply chain is spread all over the 
world. 
So we get tech jobs in Silicon Valley 
but not the production jobs we need 
throughout the country because, frank-
ly, people on the coast don’t think a 
lot about what is happening in the in-
ternal part of the country—and that is 
not good enough. 
Our national security and our eco-
nomic competitiveness depend on hav-
ing a vibrant domestic manufacturing 
sector, not just a tech development 
sector 
on 
the 
coasts. 
When 
you 
outsource production, you outsource 
innovation along with it. 
We keep doing this. It is not like 
these companies where the production 
is happening are stupid people. These 
are smart people too, and they are 
going to take our inventions and our 
innovation—because we know so much 
of innovation takes place on the shop 
floor—they are going to pass us with 
their brainpower and their innovation 
and their inventions. 
Ohioans know that ideas and im-
provements come directly from the 
shop floor. That is why we were so good 
at it in the forties and fifties and six-
ties and seventies and eighties. It is 
why this bill invests in our great asset, 
the greatest asset, American innova-
tion, American workers. 
It allows Intel to move forward in Co-
lumbus—10,000 good-paying jobs up and 
down the supply chain. This historic 
investment is going to impact far more 
than just Central Ohio. When you es-
tablish an industry like this, it has rip-
ple effects around the State, around 
the region, and around the country. It 
is not just these jobs, it is the way they 
attract other suppliers. They incubate 
talent that in turn attracts other busi-
ness, the way it used to be in this coun-
try. It is just the beginning. We will 
see a lot more companies create a lot 
more jobs. Ohioans know how to make 
things. We know what that means. 
For our country, it is a decision to 
invest in American ingenuity, Amer-
ican workers, American communities. 
It is a big win for Ohio. It is a big win 
for the American industrial Midwest. It 
is a big win for our country. It is what 
I have been fighting for my whole ca-
reer: good-paying jobs. When you love 
this country, you fight for the people 
who make it work. 
More 
manufacturing 
innovation, 
more technology stamped ‘‘Made in 
Ohio’’—it is how we bury the term 
‘‘Rust Belt.’’ 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, Americans across the country are 
canceling their vacations, watching 
their 401(k)s shrink, and they are wor-
rying about their week’s grocery bill. 
Families are making very tight budg-
ets, and they are having to stick to 
them because the prices have risen to 
historic highs. The price of ground beef 
is 36 percent higher than it was this 
time last year, as much as a steak din-
ner this time last year if you are buy-
ing hamburger meat. Businesses are 
raising prices on consumers in order to 
make ends meet. And if the costs of 
goods and basic services weren’t high 
enough, skyrocketing gas prices have 
driven everything even higher. 
This is our economic reality of now 
and for the future for the next few 
years. My colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle and all of us need to start 
discussing ways to help our country 
and ease the economic strain, but we 
are not doing that this week or next 
week before we go on recess. For some 
reason, we are hatching plans to spend 
more taxpayer money to pay for pro-
gressive policies and programs that 
might be needed, but the American 
taxpayers need help, and they need it 
now. Americans are suffering, and the 
Federal Government is not doing its 
part to help in the economic plan. 
Let’s take a step back and talk about 
how our economy got to this point with 
record inflation. We all remember 2020. 
The economy was humming along, and 
then a global pandemic hit all around

July 25, 2022 
our country and the world. It halted 
everything. It halted production. The 
economy was shut down. It came to a 
screeching halt—something none of us 
has ever seen. 
But by the end of the year, the econ-
omy was showing signs of life. We were 
starting to open back up, and we were 
starting to move around, get people 
back to work, and get things hopefully 
back to normal in the very near future. 
As we rounded the corner, our Demo-
cratic colleagues, who took control of 
the House and the Senate and the 
White House, inherited an economy 
that wasn’t great but was getting bet-
ter. But instead of allowing free-mar-
ket forces to return us to prosperity 
coming out of this pandemic, President 
Biden, in his rookie year of office, was 
like a kid in a candy store. I can re-
member it like it was yesterday. 
He decided to go on a spending spree. 
He unveiled a plan to pump trillions of 
dollars into our Nation’s economy in 
an unprecedented amount of govern-
ment spending. Mere months after Con-
gress passed the first COVID relief bill 
in December of 2020, our colleagues on 
the left began crafting a new bill for 
more Federal spending in early 2021— 
again, just a few months after the first 
COVID relief bill was passed in Decem-
ber. 
The left disguised a litany of progres-
sive policies and programs as pandemic 
relief—I will never forget it—pandemic 
relief. But in reality, as of now—$2 tril-
lion—less than 9 percent of the bill was 
targeted to COVID-related spending—9 
percent. 
Larry Summers, who was Presidents 
Clinton and Obama’s top economic ad-
viser, said the Democrats’ spending 
package ‘‘set off inflationary pressures 
of a kind we have not seen in a genera-
tion.’’ He was exactly right. But Demo-
crats pressed forward anyway and 
passed their so-called COVID relief bill, 
amounting to almost $2 trillion in 
spending—2 trillion. The result: Infla-
tion began to soar. This injection of 
Federal stimulus into an economy that 
was already recovering was an eco-
nomic train wreck. A lot of people saw 
it coming, even the expert economists. 
Production came to a screeching halt 
during the pandemic, causing supply to 
plummet. Democrats’ efforts to pump 
excessive stimulus into the economy 
caused demand to skyrocket. In short, 
supply went down and demand went up. 
The result of low supply and high de-
mand has been the worst inflation our 
Nation has seen in decades. 
Despite President Biden’s Treasury 
Secretary claiming that the infla-
tionary spike was just going to be tem-
porary, prices continued to climb. And 
despite the very real, very clear evi-
dence that their spending was the 
cause, Democrats moved into the fall 
of last year engaged in a discussion of 
even spending more. 
In November 2021, Majority Leader 
SCHUMER said: ‘‘Want to fight infla-
tion? Then support Build Back Bet-
ter’’—referring to the name of their 
next massive spending package. 
Our Democratic colleagues dismissed 
rising prices, saying they were a result 
of corporate greed. President Biden 
claimed: ‘‘Inflation has everything to 
do with the supply chain.’’ But he 
made no mention—no mention—of all 
the millions and billions of dollars that 
he had just spent. 
Our colleagues on the left pointed 
fingers at everything but themselves 
and their reckless spending agenda, 
and now Democrats are trying to tell 
Americans that they will lower con-
sumer prices by increasing government 
spending—again. 
And, 
again, 
that 
makes no sense. It makes zero sense, 
no economic sense. 
Yes, as our country is under increas-
ing economic stress, Democrats are re-
viving talks to spend more, which will 
further increase inflation. So let’s be 
clear on this: This did not work last 
year, and it is not going to work now. 
Spending more taxpayer dollars on pro-
gressive policies is not the answer. It 
wasn’t the answer last year, it is not 
going to be the answer this year, and it 
is going to cause inflation to even go 
up higher. 
Senate 
Democrats’ 
attempt 
to 
rebrand what was once known as Build 
Back Better is a last-minute attempt 
to deliver on failed far-left policy pri-
orities before folks head on home and 
back to the ballot box in November. 
This is President Biden’s last-ditch 
effort to enact his administration’s so-
cial 
priorities. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 
Democrats are trying to put lipstick on 
a pig and have working-class Ameri-
cans pay the price. It should be telling 
to every American that the adminis-
tration does not think of how they can 
help but how they can hide, how they 
can try to hide behind a blame game 
and convince you, the American tax-
payer, the American people, that your 
economic pain is caused by something 
other than their actions. 
The buck stops here in this room, not 
anywhere else. How they want to re-
make the country into a socialist state 
and have the taxpayer foot the bill is 
the direction we are headed. 
Well, I can’t say this more plainly: 
Raising taxes to enact a liberal wish 
list on policies in the face of a poten-
tial recession is a very, very, very bad 
idea. Americans and businesses would 
be forced to bear the brunt of billions 
of dollars in new spending, which would 
be paid for by raising taxes. For 6 
months in a row, Main Street busi-
nesses have faced double-digit infla-
tion, causing optimism to plummet to 
the lowest point in nearly 50 years. 
President 
Biden 
recently 
boasted 
that his spending was ‘‘changing peo-
ple’s lives.’’ The President left out that 
it was changing people’s lives not for 
the better but for the worse. 
My colleagues, Americans are strug-
gling. All over this country, they are 
struggling. Families are using their 
savings to pay for basic bills. Would-be 
retirees are delaying their retirement 
after they have watched tens of thou-
sands of dollars vanish from their re-
tirement accounts. 
Farmers, family farms, are shoul-
dering the burden of rising input costs 
like seed, fuel, and fertilizer. We have 
got worse things coming if this con-
tinues to happen to our farmers. 
Small businesses are losing profits 
and making unwanted layoffs to stay 
afloat. We are going to lose a lot of 
small businesses, and small businesses 
made the United States of America. 
If Democrats pass their reconcili-
ation bill, nearly 62 percent of Ala-
bama’s small businesses and 1 million 
employees will be at risk of tax in-
creases that they cannot handle in this 
inflation. I have been hearing from 
small businesses and small business 
owners across my State every day. 
They are worried about their liveli-
hoods and are threatened by the eco-
nomic policies of this administration. 
Let’s find ways to bring inflation 
down, not find ways to take inflation 
up. And that is exactly what we are 
doing in this Chamber. 
One business owner in Sterrett, AL, 
told me that his earnings had gone 
down this year 50 to 60 percent. 
It is truly astounding how the Demo-
crats can look their constituents in the 
face and say that now is a good time to 
inject more spending into the economy 
just so they can pay for more progres-
sive policies. It is absolutely absurd. 
They are expecting blank checks to be 
paid and be paid for by hard-working 
American taxpayers. They can’t afford 
it. We are out of money. We are broke. 
And we need to quit spending the tax-
payers’ money. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
are putting their agenda above the best 
interests of the American people, and 
it is cruel. 
The solution to this mess, this huge 
mess that we have gotten into, is to 
cut taxes, cut regulations, and cut 
spending—just the opposite of what the 
Democrats are trying to do. Just the 
opposite. To change American lives for 
the better, Democrats should abandon 
any—any—discussion of another tax or 
another 
spending 
spree. 
Americans 
have had enough. They have had 
enough of this. They want the Amer-
ican people in this country to survive, 
and they want us to quit spending 
money. It is time for us to listen to the 
people who own this country and not 
the Federal Government, which thinks 
they own this country. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Utah. 
LIEUTENANT RIDGE ALKONIS 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, just last 
night, U.S. Navy LT Ridge Alkonis was 
forced to leave his wife and three chil-
dren and report to a Japanese prison. 
An American serviceman had to ex-
plain to his children that although he 
had done absolutely nothing wrong, he 
had to leave them, and he had to leave 
them to be incarcerated in a prison on 
foreign soil for 3 whole years—a prison 
inside a land that he had been asked to 
serve in by his country, to protect that 
country. And now he is in prison in

July 25, 2022 
that country, having been ordered to 
prison by that country even though he 
had done nothing wrong. 
While serving his country in Japan, 
Lieutenant Alkonis, a man who loves 
the country of Japan, who has spent 
years there, who had spent years there 
many years before the U.S. Navy had 
assigned him to serve in Japan—he 
served there for 2 years as a mis-
sionary. He learned the language. Both 
as a missionary and as a member of the 
U.S. Navy, he has continued his acts of 
community service in every commu-
nity where he has lived and served. He 
is a model, an upstanding citizen in 
every respect. He is a decent, kind, in-
telligent, hard-working officer, and a 
loving husband and father. 
It is while serving in Japan that he 
was involved in a car accident. It was a 
car accident that resulted from a trag-
ic, unforeseeable, unforeseen medical 
emergency. 
Now, that accident left two people 
dead. I speak sincerely when I say that 
my deepest sympathies go out to the 
victims of that accident, along with 
their families and their friends and 
their loved ones. I can’t begin to imag-
ine their sense of loss and confusion 
and hurt and even anger associated 
with the horrific accident. 
It is important to note, however, that 
this was, in fact, an accident. In no 
way, shape, or form do the facts of the 
case suggest otherwise—quite to the 
contrary. All of the facts in evidence 
indicate that this is what happened, 
and yet the Japanese court continues 
to 
insist 
that 
Lieutenant 
Alkonis 
somehow had some culpability, that he 
did something wrong. They continue to 
float the false narrative that he fell 
asleep while driving as a result of his 
own carelessness or negligence. That 
simply is not true. 
The accident occurred at 1 p.m. a lit-
tle over a year ago—at 1 p.m. in broad 
daylight. Lieutenant Alkonis was well 
rested and had no reason to be tired or 
drowsy. In fact, he was having a con-
versation with his daughter when he 
passed out midsentence. He remained 
unconscious despite his daughter’s re-
peated attempts to yell and scream and 
kick the seat. Alkonis did not wake in 
response to his daughter’s cries, nor 
did he wake even upon impact when 
the accident occurred. No matter how 
deep a sleeper, anyone would be awak-
ened by either of these events, but he 
didn’t. He remained unconscious even 
after the collision. 
It is important to note that eye-
witnesses reported that Lieutenant 
Alkonis’s color had drained from his 
face, which is precisely consistent with 
what would happen with someone who 
has suffered from a syncopal episode 
like this one. He was too weak to even 
open his car door after he finally re-
gained consciousness in the wake of 
the accident. 
It is simply disingenuous that Judge 
Kumiko Maesawa would offer such a 
simplistic view by stating that Alkonis 
should have pulled over if he felt 
drowsy. It flies in the face of the evi-
dence and the experiences of everyone 
at the scene, including—and espe-
cially—his family, who were present at 
the time. The comments are even more 
egregious considering the fact that the 
Japanese authorities didn’t even so 
much as bother to conduct a thorough 
investigation into the medical event 
following the crash. They appear to 
have been willfully inclined to dis-
regard pretty clear indications of a 
medical 
emergency. 
Apparently, 
it 
wasn’t what they wanted to find. So 
they didn’t find it. So they didn’t con-
duct the thorough investigation that 
needed to be conducted. He was even 
denied a medical evaluation before the 
Japanese police subjected him to 26 
days of rigorous detention and custo-
dial interrogation before he was so 
much as charged. 
This is not how friends treat each 
other. This is not how one friendly na-
tion treats another nation when one 
nation sends its best and its brightest 
and its bravest, including people like 
LT Ridge Alkonis, to go and fight to 
protect that country. That is not how 
we treat each other as nations. 
The U.S. Navy did conduct an inves-
tigation, the same kind of investiga-
tion that should have been conducted 
by the Japanese authorities but the 
Japanese authorities didn’t conduct. 
And in that investigation the U.S. 
Navy, very thorough in its approach, 
concluded that Lieutenant Alkonis, in 
fact, lost consciousness, and the loss of 
consciousness was attributed in that 
thorough investigation to something 
known as acute mountain sickness. 
There were no drugs in his system. 
There was no alcohol in his system. 
Nothing like that had anything to do 
with this crash. And yet, even after the 
Navy concluded that he was not at 
fault, Lieutenant Alkonis did every-
thing within his power to remedy the 
situation, because being the brave, pa-
triotic, decent, kind, loving American 
that he is, he was heartbroken over the 
fact that an accident had occurred that 
he was involved in and that two people 
had lost their lives. 
You know, there is a tradition in the 
Japanese culture, a tradition that is in 
so many respects admirable. It is 
known as the ‘‘gomenasai’’ tradition. 
Under 
the 
‘‘gomenasai’’ 
tradition, 
when something awful happens, there 
is an attempt made by those involved 
in an incident or resulting in loss. You 
go to the family, the loved ones of the 
deceased, and offer something to offset 
it. We may think of it in rough terms 
here as a crude approximation of res-
titution. It is not exactly that, but it is 
a significant, profound gesture of re-
morse of the fact that the incident hap-
pened at all. In fact, he paid over $1.5 
million to the victims’ families, more 
than what would ordinarily be consid-
ered 
customary 
within 
the 
‘‘gomenasai’’ tradition. 
He has expressed deep and sincere re-
morse, and despite all of this, despite 
all 
of 
his 
efforts 
through 
the 
‘‘gomenasai’’ process, despite all of 
these mitigating circumstances, de-
spite the deep remorse, and despite the 
noble, unblemished record of distin-
guished service to the U.S. Navy and to 
Japan, despite using every resource at 
his disposal to make things right, he is 
still in prison. 
I find it nothing short of inexcusable 
that an American who experienced a 
medical emergency should be treated 
so poorly by an allied nation that he is 
protecting. Japanese nationals con-
victed of the same crime are routinely 
granted leniency. In fact, 95 percent of 
similarly charged defendants get a sus-
pended sentence; meaning, even if they 
are charged, even if they are convicted, 
95 percent of them don’t actually have 
to do prison time because their sen-
tence has been suspended. 
Clearly, the Japanese judicial system 
is trying to make an example of Lieu-
tenant 
Alkonis, 
perhaps 
stemming 
from a history of disputes over our sta-
tus of forces agreement. But I will note 
here that those disputes have abso-
lutely nothing to do with Lieutenant 
Alkonis. No, he is being targeted here 
because he is an American and because 
he was in the unfortunate position of 
having suffered a medical emergency 
that resulted in tragedy. 
This is no way for a friendly nation 
to treat a friendly nation. These con-
versations are difficult because we 
have a great relationship with Japan. 
We have been allies for a long time. We 
have had a good relationship under our 
status of forces agreement. So these 
conversations are difficult, but not in 
spite of the fact that our Nations are 
friendly but because they are friendly, 
we need to have difficult conversations, 
just as sometimes it is only a friend 
who can approach a friend and speak 
the truth. 
How, I would ask, can we possibly en-
sure justice for the thousands of Amer-
ican men and women who serve our 
country abroad when they face preju-
dice because of their status as Ameri-
cans and as American servicemen and 
servicewomen? 
Lieutenant Alkonis represents our 
best—our very best, the best of the 
best. If our servicemembers can’t get 
fair treatment from the country they 
have been tasked to defend—especially 
those who, like Lieutenant Alkonis, 
represent the very best ideals of the 
U.S. Navy—then maybe it is time to re-
visit key portions of our status of 
forces agreement with Japan. If their 
due process protections aren’t suffi-
cient to protect someone like Lieuten-
ant Alkonis, to make sure that he has 
an adequate opportunity to build his 
case, to prepare to meet his accusers, 
to gather exculpatory evidence, then 
something is wrong with the status of 
forces agreement. 
I am still not entirely convinced—not 
at all—that there weren’t violations of 
the status of forces agreement. In fact, 
it appears that there were here. But to 
the extent the status of forces agree-
ment is insufficient to deal with those,

then we need to reopen that because 
this is too high a price to pay. 
We are willing to make sure that 
there are consequences to people who 
disobey a law, who engage in bad be-
havior on foreign land. But to have a 
situation like this one, where someone 
through no fault of his own, just as a 
result of a tragic medical emergency of 
which he had no prior warning whatso-
ever, to have him sent to prison for 3 
years bereft of his friends, his family, 
his career that he so deeply loved, his 
children, to whom he is everything— 
this is wrong. We deserve better than 
this from an allied nation, especially a 
nation with which we have such a gen-
erally good relationship, as we do with 
Japan. And so I sincerely hope and 
pray that Ambassador Emanuel, Sec-
retary Blinken, and the Department of 
Defense will immediately take every 
step possible to negotiate with their 
Japanese counterparts and bring Ridge 
home. 
I call upon the President of the 
United States to intervene directly 
with his counterpart and bring Ridge 
home. I call upon all sympathetic ears 
within the sound of my voice to plead 
not only with decision makers in Japan 
but with almighty God to bring Ridge 
home. We need that to happen. It is not 
just about Ridge Alkonis and his fam-
ily. It is about the security and con-
fidence needed by every service family 
in the American Armed Forces. De-
ployed whether in Japan or anywhere 
else, they need to know that we have 
their backs. They need to know that 
while they are in the service of the 
United States of America, we will 
watch out for them; that when a for-
eign country makes a tragic mistake, 
as they have done here, we will con-
tinue to advocate for them until we 
bring them home. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in 
the effort to bring Ridge home. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the Senate floor once again 
this evening to talk about the brutal 
and illegal, unjustified invasion of 
Ukraine by Russia and what we can 
do—what more we can do here in this 
Chamber and this Congress to be able 
to help the people of Ukraine. 
This is the updated map that tells 
the story of what is going on on the 
battlefield. You can see this light-blue 
color here indicates that the Ukraine 
forces are on the move and making 
progress. But in the meantime, Russia, 
back in 2014, took Crimea, part of the 
Donbas. Now they have taken more of 
that territory. 
So the fighting we will talk about to-
night that is most fierce is taking 
place here in the east and now increas-
ingly here in the south. This is where 
the battlefield is, but that is not the 
only place where things are happening. 
Remember, 
this 
is 
a 
country— 
Ukraine—that just wants to live in 
peace with its neighbors. It has no in-
terest in war. And this is Russia’s as-
sault on that country, starting in 2014 
and now in this larger assault. But it is 
not just here on this battlefield. Russia 
is actually sending missiles into the 
heart of Ukraine. 
You see this town here, Vinnytsia. 
This is where, recently, a missile ex-
ploded, killing civilians, children. Last 
week, I talked about Liza, the young 
girl who was killed in that bombing. 
Everyplace in Ukraine is subject to 
this kind of bombing. We have heard 
from Kharkiv. We have seen it in Kyiv 
and 
other 
towns 
all 
throughout 
Ukraine. 
Another part of this brutal assault on 
Ukraine has to do with blocking the 
ports. Here is Odesa. This is the largest 
port. But there are several ports along 
here that have been blocked by the 
Russians. The Russian Navy is not al-
lowing exports from Ukraine to be sent 
to the rest of the world. This, of 
course, is hurting Ukraine’s economy, 
which is the whole idea. But it is also 
preventing the export of millions of 
tons of grain, which is creating a glob-
al food crisis, threatening the lives of 
millions of people around the world, 
particularly in Africa where they rely 
heavily on Ukrainian grains coming 
out of these ports. 
After weeks of discussions—really, 
the last couple of months—finally, on 
Friday, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and 
the United Nations agreed to facilitate 
the export of Ukrainian grain. Accord-
ing to the U.N. Secretary General An-
tonio Guterres, who has been working 
on this for months, this provides a 
‘‘glimmer of hope’’ in alleviating the 
global food security crisis. 
One part of the agreement that was 
reached in Turkey was that Russia 
would not attack facilities in these 
Ukrainian 
cities. 
Specifically, 
the 
agreement prohibited ‘‘any attacks 
against merchant vehicles and other ci-
vilian vessels and port facilities en-
gaged in’’ the export of Ukrainian agri-
cultural products. So there is an agree-
ment to allow the grain to go but also 
a specific agreement not to attack 
merchant vessels, civilian vessels, port 
facilities that were involved in export. 
The ink was quite literally barely 
dry when Russia violated the terms of 
that agreement. Within 24 hours, the 
Russians 
fired 
four 
missiles 
at 
Ukraine’s largest port, Odesa, which, 
again, is critical to exporting the grain 
from Ukraine. By striking the port in-
frastructure, they violated the agree-
ment right after signing it. 
Here is the port. You can see the 
damage that was caused. There were 
actually four missiles fired from war-
ships into Odesa. Two of them were 
intercepted 
by 
anti-aircraft 
weap-
onry—thank God—but two destroyed 
part of Odesa’s port infrastructure, 
therefore violating the agreement. 
I guess we all learned that Russia 
can’t be trusted, so we shouldn’t be 
surprised. 
But 
violating 
its 
inter-
national obligations less than 24 hours 
after agreeing to them may be a new 
low. 
Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s Am-
bassador to the United States, put it 
well this weekend when she said: 
We will do everything in order to perform 
and fulfill our part of the deal. When Russia 
is violating it, they are clearly showing who 
they are and that they need to be stopped. 
She went further and said: 
Everything Russia is doing in Ukraine is a 
violation of pretty much every international 
law. Attacking a sovereign country . . . is a 
war crime. 
She is right. Ambassador Bridget 
Brink, our Ambassador to Ukraine, 
also criticized Russia for this brazen 
attack. She said: 
The Kremlin continues to weaponize food. 
Russia must be held accountable. 
I talked before on this floor about 
this specific Russian attack on the 
grain bins in Odesa and other port cit-
ies, where they literally have targeted 
food that is supposed to go to starving 
people. 
President Putin apparently believes 
that this global food and energy secu-
rity crisis—the two crises—are to his 
advantage. He is seeking to pressure 
energy dependent Europeans and pres-
sure countries which rely on Ukrainian 
grain to join him in forcing Ukraine to 
surrender. 
Fortunately, it is not working. Coun-
tries in the region, in fact, are rallying 
around Ukraine more than ever. Why? 
Because they know they could be next. 
Vladimir Putin has said his ambition 
is to fully restore the borders of the old 
Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. 
And in recent years, he has learned the 
lesson that the West may not stand in 
his way. 
A few global leaders, as an example, 
stood up to President Putin when he 
invaded Georgia, a country that con-
tinues to be, in part, occupied by the 
Russians. That was 2008. And not 
enough stood up to him in Ukraine in 
2014 when, as we saw in this previous 
map, Russia brazenly invaded and took 
over Crimea and parts of the Donbas. 
When it comes to 2022, it has been 
different so far. And we should com-
mend all those countries that have 
stood up and stood with us. We now 
have a chance to actually stop this as-
sault, to stop what Russia has been 
doing, and to teach them a different 
lesson, to protect Ukraine and other 
countries in the region that Russia 
may have set its sights on. 
The free world has rallied. Freedom- 
loving 
countries—almost 
50—from 
around 
the 
world 
have 
come 
to 
Ukraine’s aid. Specifically, over 42 of 
them have provided military assist-
ance; others have provided humani-
tarian aid by way of food and nutrition 
and economic health. 
The weapons that have been provided 
have made it easier for Ukraine to de-
fend itself, to take out some of the

Russian artillery that was sitting back 
and firing on the Ukrainian positions 
with immunity because it was so far 
back the Ukrainian artillery couldn’t 
reach it. The new weapons have been 
helpful in dealing with that. 
The U.S. has provided Ukraine with a 
specific weapon to help in that regard 
called the High Mobility Artillery Sys-
tems, or HIMARS, and they have been 
critical to the Ukrainian military as 
they hold off the Russian invaders and 
allow the Ukrainian military to be on 
the offensive in some of these areas. 
A step in the right direction came 
last week. I commend the administra-
tion for sending Ukraine four more 
HIMARS systems. They now have 12 in 
operation and four more units on the 
way to the front lines. That is good, 
but they need more. What the analysts 
suggest is they need 40 or 50 just to be 
able to push the Russians back. 
Officials in Ukraine have made the 
need for these systems clear, by the 
way, for a long time—since early 
March. I have echoed that need since 
that time. Why? Because I was hearing 
it directly from the Ukrainians, from 
their military experts. 
So it took us a while, but it turns out 
the Ukrainians were right; these sys-
tems are effective. GEN Mark Milley, 
who is the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, has said that the 
HIMARS strikes are ‘‘steadily degrad-
ing the Russian ability to supply their 
troops, command and control their 
forces, and carry out their illegal war 
of aggression.’’ That is from General 
Milley. 
The Ukrainians are an effective force 
when they are armed with the right 
weapons. Officials have said that with 
the help of HIMARS, Ukraine has 
taken out Russian command posts, am-
munition depots, air defense sites, 
radar and communications nodes, and 
long-range artillery positions. These 
are all ‘‘high value’’ targets, and de-
stroying them has saved Ukrainian 
lives and saved some of the shelling of 
Ukrainian cities. 
There also seems to be some progress 
in sending Ukraine other tools to help 
them fight, particularly in the air. The 
U.S. Air Force top general hinted last 
week that Ukraine may get fourth-gen-
eration fighter jets from the United 
States or from other allies, and he left 
open the option to train Ukrainians on 
how to use them. These fourth-genera-
tion fighter jets could include U.S. F– 
16s, the Gripen from Sweden, the 
Rafale 
from 
France, 
and 
the 
Eurofighter from the European Union. 
Some of Russia’s most devastating 
strikes, of course, have come from the 
air, either from aircraft or from mis-
sile strikes. Earlier in the war, you re-
member, there were many who talked 
about 
creating 
a 
no-fly 
zone 
in 
Ukraine. That never happened. 
NATO was not willing to move for-
ward with the no-fly zone. But by pro-
viding Ukraine with advanced aircraft, 
we could empower Ukrainian fighter 
pilots to impose their own no-fly zone 
over critical areas of the country. 
Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Sec-
retary of Defense Lloyd Austin and to 
General Milley urging them to expedite 
more military assistance to Ukraine, 
including 
‘‘fourth-generation 
fighter 
aircraft and necessary flight training.’’ 
The reason we included that in our bi-
partisan letter is because we had heard 
from Ukrainian fighter pilots who 
came over here several weeks ago and 
met with us. 
I am the cofounder and cochair of the 
Ukrainian Caucus. We put together a 
meeting. It was very powerful to hear 
their words. But they said they know 
how to fly these planes. And with re-
gard to the details, they could learn 
them quickly. And it would make a 
huge difference. 
It has made a huge difference with 
what they have, which are aging Soviet 
aircrafts, MiGs, and not enough of 
them. But we have got to move quickly 
if we do this because we have to keep 
Russia from gaining more ground. And 
we have to save more lives. 
Training Ukrainian pilots on modern 
Western aircraft will take some time; 
and, as we have seen, even a day delay 
can mean the difference between life 
and death. So let’s get started. 
There is also the battle being waged 
on energy, and that is, in a sense, just 
as important as what is happening on 
the battle front. Why? Because Russia 
gets its funds from energy proceeds. 
That is what is funding the war ma-
chine. And they continue to leverage 
Europe’s dependency on their oil and 
gas as a political and economic weap-
on. 
This is plainly seen as President 
Putin continues to play games with 
Europe’s gas supply. Europe depends on 
Russia for, now, about 20 percent of its 
natural gas imports. That is down from 
around 40 percent last year—so a sig-
nificant reduction, reducing by half 
their dependency. 
But with regard to that 20 percent, 
President Putin is tightening his grip 
and retaining his leverage on Europe 
by decreasing supplies, by driving 
prices upward, and by lining his war 
chest even further. By the way, his at-
tempts to divide NATO, the North At-
lantic 
Treaty 
Alliance, 
have 
not 
worked. 
Over 
Russian 
objections, 
NATO will soon be expanding rather 
than dividing or contracting. 
Instead of splintering last Tuesday, I 
was proud to vote in committee to ad-
vance the ratification of Finland and 
Sweden’s NATO applications. 
As Republican Leader MITCH MCCON-
NELL said recently ‘‘adding these na-
tions into the fold will only strengthen 
us.’’ I agree. 
Finland, by the way, has the Euro-
pean Union’s longest border with Rus-
sia. It has a very capable air force and 
other parts of its military. In response 
to Russia’s aggression, they have in-
creased their defense spending by 70 
percent, and Sweden is targeting mili-
tary spending at the NATO commit-
ment level of 2 percent GDP as soon as 
possible and already possesses an inno-
vative and effective defense industry. 
In fact, the Swedish weapons that are 
in the market today are some of the 
most advanced in the world. Adding 
Finland and Sweden to NATO will 
strengthen the alliance’s security in 
the north, particularly the Arctic re-
gion and the Baltic Sea. 
I just learned a little while ago that 
we are going to vote on their applica-
tions to join NATO here on the Senate 
floor this week or next week. That is 
great news. I hope my colleagues will 
join me in a prompt and strong show-
ing of support, and I think they will. 
This is going to be one of the things 
that brings this Congress together, be-
cause this is in all of our interest—in 
NATO’s interest, in America’s interest, 
and certainly in Ukraine’s interest. 
It 
is 
a 
clear 
demonstration 
to 
Ukraine that NATO’s open-door policy 
is alive and well and that the alliance 
will continue to welcome applicant 
countries that meet the criteria for 
membership. I believe NATO should 
begin that process with Ukraine, allow-
ing them to enter the next step of 
NATO membership by earning what is 
called the Membership Action Plan, 
the MAP process. This plan provides a 
formal roadmap for NATO membership 
that is long overdue, in my view. 
We need to show Ukraine the world 
stands with them. And NATO is a de-
fensive alliance. NATO is about pro-
tecting countries in the region. 
Last week, Congress had the privi-
lege to hear from someone who knows 
how critically important it is that we 
stand with Ukraine right now. We 
heard from Olena Zelenska, President 
Zelenskyy’s wife. She gave a very pow-
erful speech to the Congress about the 
horrors of the war and about the des-
perate need for more advanced weapons 
from the United States and allies. 
She painted a vivid picture of life in 
Ukraine right now. Her moving words 
about her own family and about the ef-
fects this traumatizing war has etched 
in the memory of Ukraine’s children I 
thought was particularly poignant. 
She said Ukraine needs weapons to 
wage a war, ‘‘not [to be used to wage a 
war] on somebody else’s land, but to 
protect one’s home and the right to 
wake up alive in that home.’’ 
‘‘To protect one’s home and the right 
to wake up alive in that home.’’ That 
is what this is about. 
In a TV interview during her visit 
here, Ms. Zelenska talked about the 
trauma children have faced and said 
that she hopes their childhood can be 
given back to them at some point. She 
said: 
Before the war, my [nine-year-old] son 
used to go to folk dance ensemble. He played 
piano. He learned English. He of course at-
tended sports club. 
Now, she said: 
The only thing he wants to do is martial 
arts and [learn] how to use a rifle. 
It is a 9-year-old boy. 
At the Polish border and at the 
Moldovan border, I have had the oppor-
tunity to visit with refugees as they 
have come across from Ukraine. It is

all women and children, grandmothers, 
mothers, aunts—the men staying be-
hind to fight. 
This war is taking away these kids’ 
childhoods and replacing them with 
war-torn 
memories. Those children 
who fled Ukraine in the early stages of 
the war are now growing up, making 
friends, and going to schools in foreign 
countries. Seven or 8 million Ukrain-
ians left Ukraine. They are far from 
home, and they want to go home. 
And those who stayed in Ukraine are 
in constant fear that the next Russian 
missile may hit their home, their town, 
their city. Many will never have the 
opportunity to get their childhood 
back. 
First lady Olena Zelenska has even 
started her own initiative to address 
the serious mental health impacts of 
Russia’s war against her country. Al-
though underreported in most media 
outlets, Russia has forcibly deported 
millions of Ukrainians to Russia or 
Russian-controlled 
territory 
in 
the 
Donbas, including hundreds of thou-
sands of children. 
Once outside of Ukrainian territory, 
these children are taught to be Rus-
sian, not Ukrainian, in a deliberate at-
tempt by Russia to wipe out the na-
tional and cultural identity of Ukrain-
ians. 
Combined with Russia’s consistent 
denial of the existence of Ukraine’s na-
tionhood and identity, these actions 
must be acknowledged for what they 
are: genocide. And it is important that 
the United States and the rest of the 
world recognize these acts as such. 
That is one reason why the world 
must call out Russia for what is hap-
pening in Ukraine. Last Thursday, five 
Senate colleagues and I joined Senator 
RISCH, the top Republican on the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee, on 
which I served, in introducing a bipar-
tisan resolution condemning Russia’s 
actions in Ukraine as genocide. 
I know ‘‘genocide’’ is a really power-
ful word. It has a long history, and it 
has serious implications. Many people 
are understandably hesitant to use it. 
But the facts in Russia’s atrocities are 
clearly genocide. 
Article 2 of the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide defines genocide as 
any of several acts ‘‘committed with 
intent to destroy, in whole or in part, 
a national, ethnic, racial, or religious 
group.’’ 
Two of the acts in the definition are 
‘‘killing members of the group’’ and 
‘‘causing bodily or mental harm to 
members of the group.’’ Only one of 
those criteria is necessary for genocide. 
Russia all too clearly fits all of these 
parts of the definition of genocide. 
Its forces have killed and wounded 
innocent civilians all across Ukraine. 
Last week, I spoke about little Liza 
who was killed in Vinnytsia. This is 
the aftermath of the bombing in 
Vinnytsia. I have also heard about the 
‘‘target practice’’ that Russian soldiers 
have bragged about that they did in 
Severodonetsk, shooting at innocent 
civilians like it was some kind of a 
game. 
And we cannot forget the horrors of 
Bucha, where Russian forces massacred 
over 1,300 innocent civilians, some with 
hands tied behind their backs. This in-
cluded 31 children. And the mental toll 
of this war has, of course, also been ex-
treme. 
Our Senate resolution also includes a 
clause about my resolution from 2018 
commemorating the 85th anniversary 
of Holodomor, the Soviet Union’s fam-
ine genocide against Ukraine from 1932 
to 1933. Unfortunately, Russia has a 
history of committing genocide against 
the people of Ukraine, and that con-
tinues to this day. 
The world needs to let the Russian 
commanders and the Kremlin officials 
know we see the war crimes being com-
mitted, and they are being recorded. 
Perhaps that would have some sort of 
effect on what actions they take. 
The trickle-down effects of this war 
are heart-wrenching. We have all seen 
the images, the videos on social media 
of innocent civilians caught in the 
crossfire. But not only that, it is what 
this war has created: the countless 
children who are now orphans. 
I have talked about this in the past, 
but according to Under Secretary of 
State Victoria Nuland: 
Russia makes orphans, and then steals 
those orphans, up to 1,000 Ukrainian kids 
being stolen and taken and given to Russian 
families to potentially never be found by 
their families. 
That is very concerning. Let me say 
that again. She is saying that Russia 
takes these orphans and steals them 
and gives them to Russian families to 
potentially never be found by their 
Ukrainian families. 
So there are all these young boys and 
young girls who watch their fathers 
and their brothers and their uncles 
and, sometimes, their moms go to war. 
Many of them never come back home. 
There 
are 
young 
boys 
like 
Ms. 
Zelenska’s, 
a 
9-year-old, 
who 
now 
wants to be a soldier. And there are the 
children who will never be with their 
family in Ukraine again. 
That is where we are today. A merci-
less authoritarian who needs to flex his 
power against a nation that just wants 
to live peacefully—nothing more than 
to live in peace with their neighbors. 
This is a struggle between freedom 
and democracy and self-determination 
on the one hand and aggression and 
conquest 
and 
tyranny, 
authoritarianism on the other. 
Our choice is clear. At this critical 
juncture, let’s continue to work with 
our allies to provide Ukraine with what 
they need to protect that homeland, to 
defend that democracy. We need to 
help Ukraine, and we need to do more, 
and we need to do it now. We need to 
move quickly. We need to live up to 
these important words from Ukraine’s 
First Lady last week. When she was 
here in the Congress talking to us, she 
said ‘‘While Russia kills, America 
saves.’’ 
Let’s continue to save. Let’s con-
tinue to save lives every day, and let’s 
save our democratic ally Ukraine—a 
proud nation that is simply fighting for 
its survival. 
I yield the floor.

cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability.

capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing advanced, long-range 
strike systems for employment from Royal 
Australian Air Force (RAAF) air platforms 
including, but not limited to, the F/A–18F 
Super Hornet and F–35A Lightning II. Aus-
tralia will have no difficulty absorbing this

The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Orlando, FL. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Australia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–120C–7/8 Advanced Medium 
Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is a su-
personic, air launched, aerial intercept, guid-
ed missile featuring digital technology and 
micro-miniature 
solid-state 
electronics. 
AMRAAM capabilities include look-down/ 
shootdown, multiple launches against mul-
tiple targets, resistance to electronic coun-
termeasures, and interception of high and 
low-flying and maneuvering targets. The 
AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, function refresh of 
the AIM–120C–7 and is the next generation to 
be produced. 
2. The Joint Direct Attack Munition 
(JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts ex-
isting unguided free-fall bombs into an accu-
rate, adverse weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. 
The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, 
which contains the Inertial Navigation Sys-
tem (INS) and a Global Positioning System 
(GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical 
cover, which allows the JDAM to improve 
the accuracy of unguided, General Purpose 
(GP) bombs. The Guidance Set, when com-
bined with a warhead and appropriate fuze, 
forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU) and 
gives the bomb an adverse weather capa-
bility. The JDAM weapon can be delivered 
from modest standoff ranges at high or low 
altitudes against a variety of land and sur-
face targets during the day or night. The 
JDAM is capable of receiving target coordi-
nates via preplanned mission data from the 
delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors 
(i.e., FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, 
or from a third-party source via manual or 
automated aircrew cockpit entry. 
The KMU–556 is the tail kit for a GBU–31 
fitted with a 2,000LB (Mk–84 GP) bomb body. 
3. GBU–48 Enhanced Paveway II (EP–II) is 
a maneuverable, free-fall, laser-guided bombs 
(LGBs) that guide to reflected laser energy 
from the desired target. The ‘‘enhanced’’ 
component adds GPS guidance to the laser 
seeker. This dual-mode capability allows the 
weapon to operate in all weather conditions. 
The LGB is delivered the same way as a nor-
mal GP warhead, except the semi-active 
guidance corrects for employment errors in-
herent in any delivery system. Laser des-
ignation for the weapon can be provided by a 
variety of laser target markers or designa-
tors from the air or ground. The Enhanced 
Paveway system consists of a non-warhead- 
specific Enhanced Computer Control Group 
(ECCG), a warhead-specific Air Foil Group 
(AFG) that attaches to the nose and tail of 
GP bomb, and a fuze. The weapon is pri-
marily used for precision bombing against 
non-hardened targets. 
The GBU–48 is a 1,000LB (MK–83 GP) bomb 
body fitted with the MXU–667 AFG and 
MAU–210 ECCG to guide to its laser-des-
ignated target. 
4. The FMU–139 Joint Programmable Fuze 
(JPF) is a multi-delay, multi-arm and prox-
imity sensor compatible with General Pur-
pose blast, frag, and hardened-target pene-
trator weapons. The FMU–139 settings are 
cockpit selectable in flight when used with 
numerous precision-guided weapons. It can 
interface with numerous weapons, including 
GBU–31 and GBU–48. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
7. A determination has been made that Ku-
wait can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.

this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Kuwait.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING JARED DON 
RICKER 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I honor 
Jared Don Ricker, of Caldwell, ID, who 
passed away unexpectedly on June 12, 
2022, at the far too young age of 42. He 
is deeply missed by his family and 
many friends and remembered as a 
wonderful man, great father, kind lis-
tener, and fun companion. 
I came to know of Jared through two 
of his three brothers, Bryan and Cam-
eron, who have both served as members 
of my staff. Bryan represented me as a 
regional director for southwest Idaho. 
Cameron is chief clerk of the Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs, a position he served in 
when I was chairman of the committee. 
I extend my deep condolences to 
Jared’s many loved ones, who include 
his wife Brianna Lynn and four chil-
dren: Jackson Don, Brice Laney, Camp-
bell Zoe, and Collins Bree. My prayers 
for God’s comfort are also with Jared’s 
parents, Don and Peggy, as they mourn 
the loss of their son, Jared’s other 
brother, Chase, and Jared’s many other 
family members and friends. 
Jared, who was born on February 8, 
1980, and graduated from Nampa High 
School, was a fellow Eagle Scout. He 
shared this proud achievement with his 
son, Jackson. Jared also served a mis-
sion for the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in Columbus, OH. 
After returning from his mission, he 
met and married the love of his life 
Bri, and they made a beautiful family 
together. He earned his associate de-
gree in multimedia and worked with 
his employer of 15 years, Iliad Media 
Group, as the IT director and sup-
porting engineer. 
Jared shared his love and laughs gen-
erously with his family, friends, co-
workers, 
and 
all 
those 
who 
were 
blessed to be a part of his life. He was 
a fun-loving and deeply caring father, 
husband, son, brother, uncle, son-in- 
law, brother-in-law, and friend. He 
loved his children dearly, their pas-
sions and talents, and he loved serving 
others, sharing the gospel and making 
connections. His obituary movingly 
notes, ‘‘He showed his love by filling 
your soul and your belly . . . Jared al-
most always had a smile on his face. 
Everyone was a friend to him. He left 
anyone he met a better person.’’ Those 
who knew him recall his kindness, gen-
erosity, and humor. Jared is remem-
bered as a great listener with a heart of 
gold. 
We are so fortunate to have had 
Jared’s light glow so brightly in our 
world. My heart goes out to all those 
who loved him, as we honor his life, 
mourn his loss, and cherish his loving 
memory.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM KUNTZ 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Tom Kuntz of Carbon County for his 
unwavering dedication to the Red 
Lodge community and his 30 years of 
public service to the people of Montana 
through his selfless firefighting career. 
As a graduate from both the National 
Fire Academy Executive Fire Officers 
Program and Ithaca College, Tom 
brought his skills and passion to the 
Treasure State when he first moved to 
Montana in 1992 and began what would 
become a distinguished career in fire-
fighting. He now serves as the chief of 
the Red Lodge Fire Department and 
has been an active leader in responding 
to the fires and natural disasters that 
have impacted the community over the 
years. 
Notably, Tom served as a key player 
in responding to the 24,000-acre Robert-
son Draw Fire that blazed through Car-
bon County in June of 2021. Roughly 1 
year after the community faced the 
devastating wildfire, they were hit 
with 
historic 
flooding, 
which 
has 
wreaked havoc throughout the county. 
Referred to as ‘‘the 500-year flood,’’ the 
high waters have caused catastrophic 
damage to people’s homes, properties, 
businesses, and public infrastructure. 
Tom acted swiftly, working on the 
frontlines to help mitigate the wreck-
age and help members of the Red Lodge 
community. 
Tom and his wife Eliza also serve the 
community through their various res-
taurant 
and 
hospitality 
businesses 
which have become staples in down-
town Red Lodge and attract both locals 
and visitors from near and far. They 
also raised their two daughters to be 
involved in public service, and they 
regularly help out at the family busi-
nesses. 
It is my honor to recognize Tom 
Kuntz for his dedication to keeping the 
people of Red Lodge safe through a 
seemingly relentless series of natural 
disasters and for his many years of 
public service to the great State of 
Montana. Tom, thank you for all you 
do help our communities prosper and 
stay safe. You make Montana proud.∑

REMEMBERING DANIEL J. 
WHITFIELD 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Daniel J. Whitfield, a ‘‘happy warrior’’ 
in the conservative movement whose 
dynamic personality and disarming 
humor brought countless conservative 
activists together in friendship for the 
cause of liberty. 
In addition to Dan’s engaging pres-
ence 
at 
conferences, 
networking 
events, and small gatherings, he was 
also a gifted writer and communicator 
who channeled his mastery of the 
English language into high-impact di-
rect mail fundraising appeals and— 
later—gripping fiction. 
Dan was born in Birmingham, Eng-
land, on September 14, 1982, to Michael 
and Jennifer. He was a lifelong lover of 
liberty, joining the UK Conservative 
Party at the age of 14. He proudly dis-
played a photo of the Right Honourable 
Baroness, Margaret Thatcher, on his 
bedroom wall. 
After graduating from Nottingham 
University, Daniel earned a M.A. in 
history from the University of Wis-
consin-Milwaukee. Dan moved to the 
Washington, DC, area shortly there-
after for an internship at the Leader-
ship Institute. Dan soon joined the LI 
staff full-time, where he built up his re-
sume by empowering conservative ac-
tivists to become leaders while devel-
oping lifelong connections across the 
conservative movement in the United 
States. 
After more than 2 years at LI, Dan 
became a copywriter for the Eberle 
Communications Group, a job he cher-
ished from the start as it allowed him 
to stay in the U.S., where he would be 
able to pursue a career as well as his 
future wife, Nena Bartlett. Dan re-
mained a longtime volunteer faculty 
member for LI, giving generously of his 
time to train hundreds of conservatives 
to become better writers. 
Daniel dreamed of having a big fam-
ily and, after a truly unique courtship, 
began building one with his wife, Nena, 
in 2014. 
Dan and Nena brought three beau-
tiful girls into the world: Dagny Joy, 
Magnolia Jennifer, and Zora Katherine. 
Dan’s incredible spirit shines through 
in each of his daughters. 
In addition to starting a family, 
Dan’s other life ambition was to be-
come a published author. He achieved 
his goal with his first book, ‘‘Eagle As-
cending,’’ published by TouchPoint 
Press. His second book, ‘‘The Spider’s

humously next year. 
Dan touched the lives of countless 
thousands of conservative activists in 
the United States and across the pond. 
His roots may have been in Notting-
ham, but Dan Whitfield was American 
through and through. Anyone lucky 
enough to have met Dan even for just 
a moment is better for it. Dan’s per-
sonal warmth and professional accom-
plishments have left an indelible mark 
on countless people around the world. 
He will be greatly missed.∑

REMEMBERING WILLIE ELDRAGE 
ARTIS 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a highly regarded busi-
ness leader, mentor, and community 
leader from Flint, MI: Mr. Willie 
Eldrage Artis, founder and owner of 
Genesee Packaging, who passed away 
on June 2, 2022, at the age of 88. Mr. 
Artis made an immeasurable impact as 
a partner to the automotive industry, 
on the Flint community, and the State 
of Michigan over the past 40 years. It is 
a privilege and a sorrow both to recog-
nize him here today and celebrate his 
lifework and many achievements. 
Born in 1934, Willie spent the first 18 
years of his life living with his parents 
in Memphis, TN, amid the height of the 
South’s Jim Crow Era. Though dif-
ficult, these years instilled in Willie an 
unfailing work ethic and the ability to 
stand up for himself and his rights, 
even in the most difficult of cir-
cumstances. After leaving for Chicago, 
Willie began working on the manufac-
turing floor of the Triangle Container 
Corrugated Company, learning the ins- 
and-outs of the packaging business 
from the ground up. He brought this 
knowledge with him when he moved to 
Flint in 1964 and began working for 
Flint Boxmakers. In just 2 years, he 
was promoted to manufacturing man-
ager. 
In 1979, Willie and a fellow colleague 
of color took advantage of the recently 
issued minority business programs ad-
ministered by General Motors to lever-
age their years of expertise and open 
Genesee Packaging. Since its forma-
tion, Genesee Packaging has been a 
place of opportunity for the commu-
nity to gain employment and increased 
access to economic achievement for 
customers and employees alike. 
His energetic service to the Flint 
community and State of Michigan in-
cluded his membership with the Michi-
gan Minority Business Development 
Council, Genesys Health Systems, the 
Flint Public Library, and the Flint 
Business and Development Council. In 
1989, he was appointed to serve on Gov-
ernor 
James 
Blanchard’s 
entrepre-
neurial business commission, was in-
ducted into the Junior Achievement 
Business Hall of Fame in 2001, and in 
2005 received special recognition from 
Governor Jennifer Granholm for his 
many contributions to the State of 
Michigan. Additional recognition for 
his work in minority business develop-
ment and civil rights came from then 
President Bill Clinton, the U.S. Senate, 
the Michigan House of Representatives, 
the State of Michigan, and the city of 
Flint. 
In October of 2019, Willie published 
his memoir in a book titled ‘‘From Jim 
Crow to CEO: The Willie E. Artis 
Story,’’ where he shared his lessons 
from life and business as one of Amer-
ica’s most honored industrialists. His 
story embodies that of the American 
dream, rising up from poverty through 
determination and hard work, embrac-
ing entrepreneurship and becoming a 
sought-after partner by top corpora-
tions and even the White House during 
the Obama administration. 
I cannot understate the impact that 
Mr. Artis has had on the city of Flint 
and State of Michigan. A pillar of 
strength and leadership throughout the 
community and the embodiment of 
generosity to those who knew him per-
sonally, Willie will no doubt be missed, 
but his legacy will endure. I ask you to 
join me—and Willie’s beloved wife 
Veronica, their children, and their 
grandchildren—in recognizing and cele-
brating his life and numerous accom-
plishments. I hope that each of us can 
find some comfort in the precious mo-
ments and memories that were shared 
with him.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 718—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK OF JULY 19 
THROUGH 
JULY 
25, 
2022, 
AS 
‘‘BLACK 
MATERNAL 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
AWARENESS 
WEEK’’ 
AND SUPPORTING THE GOAL OF 
RAISING AWARENESS AND UN-
DERSTANDING AROUND MATER-
NAL 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
CONDI-
TIONS AS THEY AFFECT BLACK 
INDIVIDUALS 
Mr. OSSOFF submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 718 
Whereas 1 in 8 women and 1 in 6 Black 
women will suffer from a maternal mental 
health condition at some point during their 
lifetimes; 
Whereas maternal mental health and sub-
stance 
use 
disorder 
conditions 
initially 
present during pregnancy or the year fol-
lowing childbirth, stillbirth, or miscarriage, 
and include depression, anxiety, obsessive 
compulsive disorder, psychosis, and other 
conditions; 
Whereas suicide and overdose caused by a 
maternal mental health or substance use dis-
order condition contribute to the rising ma-
ternal mortality rate; 
Whereas non-Hispanic Black individuals 
are 3 times more likely to have a maternal 
death than white individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas untreated maternal mental health 
conditions cost the United States economy 
$14,200,000,000 each year due to productivity 
loss, preterm births, child behavioral and de-
velopmental costs, and other health-related 
costs; 
Whereas maternal mental health condi-
tions 
impair 
mother-infant 
interactions 
causing negative behavioral, cognitive, and 
emotional impacts on the infant; 
Whereas untreated maternal depression 
during pregnancy leads to a higher risk of 
preterm and low birth weight delivery and 
infant mortality; 
Whereas many health professionals receive 
limited or no formal training on providing 
culturally appropriate maternity care in di-
verse communities; 
Whereas 50 percent of individuals with a 
maternal mental health condition never re-
ceive treatment, and Black women are less 
likely than white women to access or con-
tinue treatment, or refill a prescription for a 
maternal mental health condition; 
Whereas best practices for the prevention 
and treatment of maternal mental health 
conditions include collaborative and cul-
turally and linguistically appropriate models 
of group prenatal or postpartum care; 
Whereas 
addressing 
maternal 
mental 
health conditions is integral in reaching the 
Healthy People 2030 goals of the Department 
of Health and Human Services of a 10 percent 
reduction of the maternal mortality rate, 
maternal illnesses and complications due to 
pregnancy, and the preterm live birth rate; 
and 
Whereas more research on Black maternal 
mental health outcomes and care, existing 
State and other programs, and innovative 
maternity care models designed to reduce ra-
cial and ethnic disparities in maternal 
health outcomes is needed to inform evi-
dence-based treatments, promote prevention 
and recovery support efforts, facilitate early 
identification, dispel stigmas and barriers to 
care, and provide insight on illness causation 
and the effects of maternal mental health 
conditions on infants and communities: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of July 19 through 
July 25, 2022, as ‘‘Black Maternal Mental 
Health Awareness Week’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Black 
Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week to 
raise public awareness and understanding 
around maternal mental health conditions 
and their disproportionate impact on Black 
women and families; 
(3) recognizes the need for culturally and 
linguistically appropriate prevention, inter-
vention, treatment, and recovery support 
services for individuals affected by maternal 
mental health conditions; 
(4) acknowledges the need for further re-
search on maternal mental health treatment 
models that are effective in reducing racial 
and ethnic disparities in health outcomes; 
and 
(5) encourages Federal, State, and local 
governments and citizens of the United 
States— 
(A) to support Black Maternal Mental 
Health Awareness Week through programs 
and activities; and 
(B) to promote public awareness of mater-
nal mental health conditions as those condi-
tions affect Black individuals.

sory board of the applicable agency estab-
lished under section 20003(b)(2), shall grant

diction for enforcement or implementation;

tor shall grant the entire application.

part and specify in the final decision which 
covered provisions are waived. 
(E) RECORD OF DECISION.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after receiving a copy of an application 
under subparagraph (A), an applicable agen-
cy shall approve or deny the application and 
submit to the Director a record of the deci-
sion, which shall include a description of 
each likely health and safety risk, each risk 
that is likely to cause economic damage, and 
the likelihood for unfair or deceptive prac-
tices to be committed against consumers 
that the covered provision the applicant is 
seeking to have waived protects against, 
and— 
(I) if the application is approved, a descrip-
tion of how the identifiable, significant 
harms will be mitigated and how consumers 
will be protected under the waiver; 
(II) if the applicable agency denies the 
waiver, a description of the reasons for the 
decision, including why a waiver would like-
ly cause health and safety risks, likely cause 
economic damage, and increase the likeli-
hood for unfair or deceptive practices to be 
committed against consumers, and the like-
lihood of such risks occurring, as well as rea-
sons why the application cannot be approved 
in part or reformed to mitigate such risks; 
and 
(III) if the applicable agency determines 
that a waiver would likely cause health and 
safety risks, likely cause economic damage, 
and there is likelihood for unfair or decep-
tive practices to be committed against con-
sumers as a result of the covered provision 
that an applicant is requesting to have 
waived, but the applicable agency deter-
mines such risks can be protected through 
less restrictive means than denying the ap-
plication, the applicable agency shall pro-
vide a recommendation of how that can be 
achieved. 
(ii) NO RECORD SUBMITTED.—If the applica-
ble agency does not submit a record of the 
decision with respect to an application for a 
waiver submitted to the applicable agency, 
the Office shall assume that the applicable 
agency does not object to the granting of the 
waiver. 
(iii) EXTENSION.—The applicable agency 
may request one 30-day extension of the 
deadline for a record of decision under clause 
(i). 
(iv) EXPEDITED REVIEW.—If the applicable 
agency provides a recommendation described 
in clause (i)(III), the Office shall provide the 
applicant with a 60-day period to make nec-
essary changes to the application, and the 
applicant may resubmit the application to 
the applicable agency for expedited review 
over a period of not more than 60 days. 
(4) NONDISCRIMINATION.—In considering an 
application for a waiver, an applicable agen-
cy 
shall 
not 
unreasonably 
discriminate 
among applications under the Program or re-
sort to any unfair or unjust discrimination 
for any reason. 
(5) FEE.—The Office may collect an appli-
cation fee from each applicant under the 
Program, which— 
(A) shall be in a fair amount and reflect 
the cost of the service provided; 
(B) shall be deposited in the general fund of 
the Treasury and allocated to the Office, 
subject to appropriations; and 
(C) shall not be increased more frequently 
than once every 2 years. 
(6) WRITTEN AGREEMENT.—If each applica-
ble agency grants a waiver requested in an 
application submitted under paragraph (1), 
the waiver shall not be effective until the ap-
plicant enters into a written agreement with 
the Office that describes each covered provi-
sion that is waived under the Program. 
(7) LIMITATION.—An applicable agency may 
not waive under the Program any tax, fee, or 
charge imposed by the Federal Government. 
(8) APPEALS.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If an applicable agency 
denies an application under paragraph (3)(E), 
the applicant may submit to the Office 1 ap-
peal for reconsideration, which shall— 
(i) address the comments of the applicable 
agency that resulted in denial of the applica-
tion; and 
(ii) include how the applicant plans to 
mitigate the likely risks identified by the 
applicable agency. 
(B) OFFICE
RESPONSE.—Not later than 60 
days after receiving an appeal under sub-
paragraph (A), the Director shall— 
(i) determine whether the appeal suffi-
ciently addresses the concerns of the appli-
cable agency; and 
(ii)(I) if the Director determines that the 
appeal sufficiently addresses the concerns of 
the applicable agency, file a record of deci-
sion detailing how the concerns have been 
remedied and approve the application; or 
(II) if the Director determines that the ap-
peal does not sufficiently address the con-
cerns of the applicable agency, file a record 
of decision detailing how the concerns have 
not been remedied and deny the application. 
(9) NONDISCRIMINATION.—The Office shall 
not unreasonably discriminate among appli-
cations under the Program or resort to any 
unfair or unjust discrimination for any rea-
son in the implementation of the Program. 
(10) JUDICIAL REVIEW.— 
(A) RECORD OF DECISION.—A record of deci-
sion described in paragraph (3)(E) or (8)(B) 
shall be considered a final agency action for 
purposes of review under section 704 of title 
5, United States Code.

waive every covered provision requested by 
the covered entity. 
(D) FINAL DECISION.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clause (ii), the 
head of an applicable agency, or a designee 
thereof, who receives a copy of an applica-
tion under subparagraph (A) shall, with the 
consideration of the recommendations of the 
advisory board of the applicable agency es-
tablished under section 20003(b)(2), make the 
final decision to grant or deny the applica-
tion. 
(ii) IN PART APPROVAL.— 
(I) IN GENERAL.—If more than 1 applicable 
agency receives a copy of an application 
under subparagraph (A)— 
(aa) the head of each applicable agency (or 
their designees), with input from the advi-
sory board of the applicable agency estab-
lished under section 20003(b)(2), shall grant 
or deny the waiver of the covered provisions 
over which the applicable agency has juris-
diction for enforcement or implementation; 
and 
(bb) if each applicable agency that receives 
an 
application 
under 
subparagraph 
(A) 
grants the waiver under item (aa), the Direc-
tor shall grant the entire application. 
(II) IN PART APPROVAL BY DIRECTOR.—If an 
applicable agency denies part of an applica-
tion under subclause (I) but another applica-
ble agency grants part of the application, the 
Director shall approve the application in 
part and specify in the final decision which 
covered provisions are waived. 
(E) RECORD OF DECISION.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after receiving a copy of an application 
under subparagraph (A), an applicable agen-
cy shall approve or deny the application and 
submit to the Director a record of the deci-
sion, which shall include a description of 
each likely health and safety risk, each risk 
that is likely to cause economic damage, and 
the likelihood for unfair or deceptive prac-
tices to be committed against consumers 
that the covered provision the covered entity 
is seeking to have waived protects against, 
and— 
(I) if the application is approved, a descrip-
tion of how the identifiable, significant 
harms will be mitigated and how consumers 
will be protected under the waiver; 
(II) if the applicable agency denies the 
waiver, a description of the reasons for the 
decision, including why a waiver would like-
ly cause health and safety risks, likely cause 
economic damage, and increase the likeli-
hood for unfair or deceptive practices to be 
committed against consumers, and the like-
lihood of such risks occurring, as well as rea-
sons why the application cannot be approved 
in part or reformed to mitigate such risks; 
and 
(III) if the applicable agency determines 
that a waiver would likely cause health and 
safety risks, likely cause economic damage, 
and there is likelihood for unfair or decep-
tive practices to be committed against con-
sumers as a result of the covered provision 
that a covered entity is requesting to have 
waived, but the applicable agency deter-
mines such risks can be protected through 
less restrictive means than denying the ap-
plication, the applicable agency shall pro-
vide a recommendation of how that can be 
achieved. 
(ii) NO RECORD SUBMITTED.—If the applica-
ble agency does not submit a record of the 
decision with respect to an application for a 
waiver submitted to the applicable agency, 
the Office shall assume that the applicable

cy

not 
unreasonably 
discriminate 
among applications under the Program or re-
sort to any unfair or unjust discrimination

the Treasury and allocated to the Office, 
subject to appropriations; and 
(C) shall not be increased more frequently 
than once every 2 years. 
(6) WRITTEN AGREEMENT.—If each applica-
ble agency grants a waiver requested in an 
application submitted under paragraph (1), 
the waiver shall not be effective until the 
covered entity enters into a written agree-
ment with the Office that describes each cov-
ered provision that is waived under the Pro-
gram. 
(7) LIMITATION.—An applicable agency may 
not waive under the Program any tax, fee, or 
charge imposed by the Federal Government.

appeal sufficiently addresses the concerns of 
the applicable agency, file a record of deci-
sion detailing how the concerns have been 
remedied and approve the application; or 
(II) if the Director determines that the ap-
peal does not sufficiently address the con-
cerns of the applicable agency, file a record 
of decision detailing how the concerns have 
not been remedied and deny the application.

cations under the Program or resort to any
