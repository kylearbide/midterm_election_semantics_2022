Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2020 
No. 185 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
God of us all, we give You thanks for 
each person working in these Halls and 
the sacrifices they make. Bless our 
Members, staffers, clerks, custodians, 
and all those weary on the campaign 
trail. 
May we be humbled by this awesome 
task of lawgiving. Kindle in us the spir-
it of Moses—the first lawgiver pictured 
in this very Chamber. As a baby, Lord, 
You know he nearly lost his life be-
cause of an abuse of power. Save us 
when we fall into the folly of Pharaoh, 
worrying more about our own rights 
than those we are to protect and serve. 
Then Moses, as a common laborer 
and murderer, was called by You. Help 
us see the gifts of each person we en-
counter in our work today, especially 
those with whom we disagree. 
At that burning bush, You told Moses 
You heard the cries of Your people. 
Help us listen to Your children in need 
from communities overwhelmed by the 
coronavirus to counties facing fires and 
floods. Give us the compassion, cour-
age, and wisdom to offer real help and 
hope. 
Amen and amen.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. WILLIE LEE LAWSON III 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of my dear 
friend and pillar of the South Florida commu-
nity, Mr. Willie Lee Lawson III. Willie sadly 
passed away on September 29, 2020. He will 
be deeply missed by those who knew and 
loved him. He was born in Americus, Georgia, 
to parents who instilled in him the importance 
of serving his community at an early age. 
Eventually, Willie and his family moved to 
Pompano Beach, Florida, where he would 
start to put those lessons to use as a commu-
nity advocate. 
Willie was a selfless leader who served mul-
tiple terms as the President of the Miami-Dade 
and North Broward County NAACP, respec-
tively, and as the Chair of the Minority Busi-
ness Council, New Alliance of Interactive 
Leaders & Supporters (NAILS) Founder & 
President, Advanced Certified Toastmaster, 
and committee leader for First-Time Home-
buyers Program. 
His dedication and passion for his commu-
nity and colleagues was perhaps only outdone 
by the love he felt for his family. However, 
even here, Willie took the knowledge and love 
that came from being a parent and husband 
and used it to support the people around him. 
Whether it was a parent in need of help with 
a child who was in legal trouble, an employee 
who was wrongfully terminated from their job, 
or Black children in need of support in school, 
Willie always made time for anyone who need-
ed his help. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my heartfelt con-
dolences to Willie’s wife, Marie; and his chil-
dren, Kimberly, Keisha, Miraj, and Willie. I 
pray they find comfort during this extremely 
difficult time. Willie will be dearly missed.

NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA MONTH 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate October as Na-
tional Spina Bifida Awareness Month; and to 
pay tribute to the numerous individuals and 
their families across our country living with this 
condition. 
Spina Bifida is the nation’s most common 
permanently disabling birth defect compatible 
with life. According to the March of Dimes, 
about 1,645 babies are born with this condi-
tion in the United States each year, with the 
prevalence beinq highest in the Hispanic pop-
ulation. Known as a neural tube defect, Spina 
Bifida stems from a hole in the spinal cord that 
occurs because the spinal column fails to 
close properly during development in the 
womb; and, therefore, this condition impacts 
virtually every major organ system in the body. 
Children born with Spina Bifida typically under-
go dozens of surgeries before they become 
adults. Adults living with Spina Bifida face a 
myriad of physical and mental health com-
plications, as well as other challenges, such 
as unemployment and limited access to quality 
primary and specialty care. 
Over the last three decades, we have made 
some strides in preventing the birth defect and 
managing the care of those born with this con-
dition. In response to research that showed 
the incidence of Spina Bifida could be reduced 
by up to 70 percent with the addition of folic 
acid in a woman’s diet, the United States Pub-
lic Health Service recommended that all 
women of childbearing years should take 400 
micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent hav-
ing a pregnancy affected by a neural tube de-
fect. Based on this recommendation, I intro-
duced the Folic Acid Promotion and Birth De-
fects Prevention Act, which was passed into 
law as part of the Children’s Health Act of 
2000. This Act authorized a program within 
CDC to provide professional and public edu-
cation for folic acid awareness. In 1998, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration required 
that folic acid be added to enriched grain 
products such as bread, pasta, rice, and ce-
real to increase the likelihood that women 
would have sufficient folic acid in their diet be-
fore becoming pregnant. And, in 2016, after 
years of advocacy with the FDA and the corn 
masa industry, folic acid fortification of corn 
masa flour was finally begun to target His-
panic communities that consume more corn 
masa products than grains. But there is still 
much work to be done to ensure adequate 
consumption of this critical nutrient that can 
prevent neural tube defects. 
There are currently an estimated 166,000 
individuals in the United States living with 
Spina Bifida, approximately 65 percent of 
whom are adults. This disease is now wit-
nessing its first generation of adults, an in-
credible milestone, considering that the origi-
nal designation of Spina Bifida as a childhood 
condition meant that the vast majority of chil-
dren born with this condition did not experi-
ence life beyond youth. And while a genera-
tion of adults is an achievement worth cele-
brating, unfortunately there remain many 
unmet needs and additional health challenges 
affecting this medically fragile population. 
As individuals develop, their clinical needs 
change, as should the type of care, and often 
the type of medical professional they see for 
that care. One of challenges faced by adults 
with this condition is that while we have a co-
ordinated system of care designed to treat 
children with Spina Bifida in the United States, 
there is no equivalent for adults. Thus the 
‘‘graduating child’’ enters into a very fractured 
medical system where individuals struggle to 
find physicians willing to provide treatment. 
Unfortunately, many of these physicians lack 
basic knowledge of this complex condition, 
and hence thousands of young to middle-aged 
adults are left with few options other than to 
seek care in the emergency room, while some 
continue to see their pediatric care team at 
Spina Bifida Centers, which are designed for 
children. 
In recent years, the Spina Bifida community 
has seen a growing incidence of sudden death 
in its over 25 population. There is speculation 
that this sudden loss of life has something to 
do with the central nervous system, but the 
cause or causes remain unknown. There has 
been much energy and resources devoted to 
ensuring that people with Spina Bifida can ex-
perience full lives that are not cut short by this 
condition. As such, we must explore and un-
derstand this sudden death phenomenon so 
we can reverse this troubling trend. Moreover, 
we must support—and expand investment in— 
research to address other issues related to 
Spina Bifida and associated secondary and 
co-morbid conditions, such as hydrocephalus, 
latex allergy, neurogenic bladder, develop-
mental delay, and impaired executive func-
tioning. 
The CDC’s National Spina Bifida Program is 
the sole federal program tasked with improv-
ing the care and outcomes for people with 
Spina Bifida. In 2008, the Spina Bifida Pro-
gram created a National Spina Bifida Patient 
Registry (NSBPR) to collect the scientific data 
needed to evaluate existing medical services 
for spina bifida patients, and to provide clini-
cians, researchers, patients, and families a 
‘‘window’’ into what care models are effective 
and what treatments are not making a meas-
urable difference. Building on this in 2014, the 
Spina Bifida Program funded the development 
of a Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network 
(SBCCN) to identify and to disseminate ‘‘best 
practices’’ for the care of people with Spina 
Bifida at all ages. These programs are con-
tinuing to improve quality-of-life and outcomes 
for people with this birth defect, but their full 
potential has been constrained due to flat fed-
eral funding over the last six years. Additional 
funding could expand the number of clinics 
participating in the registry, and increase the 
amount of information reported, which in turn, 
will provide further insights into how to con-
tinue to improve care and outcomes for people 
with Spina Bifida. 
People with Spina Bifida deserve no less 
than the rest of us as we age. During a life-
time, someone with Spina Bifida will face at 
least a $1,000,000 in medical expenses, in-
cluding multiple surgeries, and most can ex-
pect to spend much of their lives in a wheel-
chair or walking with braces. We must ensure 
that adults with Spina Bifida can receive evi-
dence-based medical care tailored for their 
condition and receive that care in age-appro-
priate, non-emergency settings. I call upon my 
Congressional colleagues to prioritize in-
creased funding for the CDC Spina Bifida Pro-
gram to ensure that it will be poised to best 
guide the health care community in optimal 
treatment options for people living with Spina 
Bifida.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
SMALL 
BUSINESS 
COVID–19 
DEBT 
RE-
LIEF EXTENSION ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
the small business loan debt relief provision, 
as passed in the CARES Act, has expired with 
money still left in the fund. As we all know, 
small businesses have greatly suffered due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. According to a re-
cent Washington Post article, one in five small 
businesses have closed this year, with many 
more expected. For the small businesses that 
remain open, the SBA loan debt forgiveness 
has proven to be a lifeline. The SBA has paid 
6 months of principal, interest, and any associ-
ated fees that borrowers owe for all current 
7(a), 504, and Microloans, as well as new 
7(a), 504, and Microloans. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is putting extraor-
dinary strain on our smallest businesses—the 
very businesses who are the backbone of our 
economy. Small businesses have taken the 
biggest hits and need continued direct relief 
during this unprecedented time. That’s why I 
have been fighting to provide relief through the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), and the 
SBA debt relief program. These programs 
have proven to be effective to mitigate the 
consequences of the pandemic, however, 
small businesses continue to need our support 
and we must not turn our backs on them. 
Local economies are re-opening, but an ex-
pected second COVID–19 wave means small 
business owners will face additional uncertain-
ties and burdens in the coming months. That 
is why I am introducing the Small Business 
Debt Relief Extension Act to offer small busi-
ness owners up to a 6-month extension on the 
debt relief they are receiving on their 7(a), 
504, and Microloans. Additionally, my bill en-
sures that the entirety of the $17,000,000,000 
appropriated to this program in the CARES 
Act be used for its intended purpose. The bill 
accomplishes this in two ways: 
Businesses who are currently receiving or 
have (over the past 6 months) received the 
subsidy be granted a 6-month extension for a 
total of 12 months of debt relief; and Busi-
nesses who do not currently have a SBA loan 
and that apply up to March 30, 2021, receive 
a 6 month subsidy. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Small Business Debt Relief Ex-
tension Act.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF 
THE 
ROTARY 
CLUB 
OF 
BRYAN, TEXAS 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100 year anniversary of The 
Rotary Club of Bryan, Texas. 
Originally chartered in 1921, with only twen-
ty-five founders; today, the club has grown to 
include a membership of approximately 150 
people from all areas of Brazos County. The 
Bryan Rotary Club is passionately dedicated 
to its mission to ‘‘provide service to others; 
promote integrity; and advance world under-
standing, goodwill, and peace through our fel-
lowship of business, professional, and commu-
nity leaders.’’ 
From the beginning, the Bryan Rotary Club 
has had a broad membership from the twin 
cities of Bryan and College Station, bringing 
together a service-oriented mix of business 
and local professionals, as well as faculty and 
administrators from Texas A&M University. 
Some notable events hosted by the club in-
clude its annual golf tournament, an annual 
beans and rice dinner, and the annual New-
man 10 awards, which recognize the signifi-
cant community contributions of Brazos Valley 
businesses. 
In addition to celebrating local businesses, 
the Club is committed to supporting cultural 
activities, such as the Opera and Performing 
Arts Society Series, funding of the Bryan Her-
itage Society and Stage Center, as well as the 
club’s very own ‘‘Singing Club.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the Rotary Club of Bryan 
has had a significant and positive impact on 
the Brazos Valley during its 100-year history. 
Throughout this time, the club has grown con-
siderably, and it has never forgotten its strong 
commitment to community service. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
this significant milestone and their contribu-
tions to our community. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women who 
protect our security and liberties, and for our 
first responders who keep us safe at home.

HONORING C.T. WRIGHT 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Dr. C.T. Wright, 
who passed away in October 2020. A longtime 
resident of Arizona, Dr. Wright was a commu-
nity leader, pastor, and criminal justice advo-
cate. He was the embodiment of the American 
Dream and devoted his life to preaching unity 
and making Arizona a better place for all. 
From his work as chairman of the Arizona 
Board of Executive Clemency to his civic and 
religious pursuits, Dr. Wright was a force for 
good and his enduring legacy is his love for 
Arizona. 
Born in Social Circle, Georgia, Dr. Wright 
lived many lives as a day laborer in the Geor-
gia cotton fields, scholar, elementary school 
teacher, college professor, university presi-
dent, and leader in criminal justice reform. 
Through all of this, he learned firsthand the 
value of persistence, open-mindedness and 
hard work—and how crucial they are in build-
ing better communities. These lessons refined 
his character and took him around the world. 
After working in Africa, Dr. Wright decided 
to bring his message of unity and civility to Ar-
izona, a place he called ‘‘the greatest state on 
the planet.’’ His voice would often echo 
through the chamber and halls of the Arizona 
State Senate, in rooms of state GOP meetings 
and into the stands at campaign rallies when 
he delivered passionate prayers to members 
of a nation he saw as greatly divided—but not 
beyond repair. Throughout his years here, Dr. 
Wright quickly became a landmark member 
and advocate for Arizona’s African-American 
community and earned his place as a dele-
gate in political conventions, a member of the 
Arizona Electoral College, the Fountain Hills 
Unified School District Governing Board, chair-
man of the Arizona Board of Executive Clem-
ency and many other honors. 
After being appointed to the Board of Exec-
utive Clemency in May 2014, Dr. Wright 
helped give a second chance to inmates and 
their families through compassionate early re-
leases. It was one of many positions Dr. 
Wright used to bridge the gap between faith 
and politics and help everyday Arizonans and 
political leaders make environments that en-
courage 
inclusivity, 
understanding 
and 
progress. Dr. Wright wasn’t afraid to be out-
spoken but was reluctant of recognition. He 
wanted his work to speak for itself, and it has. 
His impact on his community was commemo-
rated with the Congressional Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in 2019. 
As he leaves us, we should remember that 
he leaves us with lessons to act on and words 
to live by, ‘‘Behold how good and how pleas-
ant it is together, together in unity.’’ I thank Dr. 
Wright for his life’s work, and Godspeed.

HONORING COMMANDER THOMAS 
KOEPPE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Commander 
Thomas Koeppe for his exemplary dedication 
to his community, and to mark his retirement 
from the Hercules Police Department after 
more than 27 years of committed service. 
Originally from El Cerrito, California, Com-
mander Koeppe began his service as a police 
officer for the city of Hercules in 1993. Since 
joining the force, Commander Koeppe has 
risen through the ranks of the Hercules Police 
Department, serving as a Training Officer, 
Special Response Officer, and Police Ser-
geant before becoming a Police Commander 
in 2012. In 2018, he also briefly served as 
Acting Police Chief, leading the department 
during a time of transition. 
Commander 
Koeppe 
has 
consistently 
earned the respect and admiration of his col-
leagues and the public, and has been recog-
nized countless times for his service to his 
community. In 1995, he was awarded the 
Medal of Valor for arresting a dangerous indi-
vidual after a long and dangerous car chase. 
He also led his department in driving under 
the influence (DUI) arrests and was honored 
by both the department and Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving for his efforts to curtail the dan-
gers of drunk driving. His dedication to the city 
is non-stop, as evident by the fact that he has 
received the Iron 96 award, given to those 
who do not use any sick leave, for 20 con-
secutive years. 
Commander Koeppe is not only an es-
teemed member of the police department, but 
he also plays an active role in his community.

On top of his professional role, he is a mem-
ber of Rotary Club International, the City Liai-
son for Special Olympics Northern California, 
and co-founder of the Hercules Swim Club. 
Commander Koeppe is a prime example of a 
community-focused officer who is committed 
to building vital ties with the community mem-
bers whom he is protecting. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Commander 
Thomas 
Koeppe is an outstanding law enforcement of-
ficer and model citizen who has served with 
honor throughout his nearly three decades of 
duty. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
honor him today.

REMEMBERING MYRA STILES 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember my friend and a local and na-
tional Democratic Party stalwart, Myra Stiles, 
who passed on Friday at the age of 84. Mrs. 
Stiles was active in Democratic Party politics, 
joining the Volunteer Women’s Roundtable 
shortly after arriving in Memphis with her hus-
band, Robert, months after the assassination 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968. She 
went on to become an officer, president, and 
treasurer of the Democratic Women of Shelby 
County, and served in positions with the 
Shelby County Democratic Executive Com-
mittee, as well as President of the Tennessee 
Federation of Democratic Women. She always 
had the Democratic women’s annual Christ-
mas Party at her home—a wonderful gath-
ering of friends in the holiday season. Mrs. 
Stiles was also a longtime member and chair 
of the Shelby County Election Commission, 
first elected in 1987. No one in the last 30 
years has done more guaranteeing access to 
the ballot and free and fair elections in Shelby 
County than Myra Stiles. She was also special 
assistant to William Farris when he served as 
chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party 
(1978–1981). Mrs. Stiles was active in the po-
litical campaigns of Harold Ford, Sr.; Harold 
Ford, Jr.; Beverly Marrero; Mary Wilder; and 
many others on the national, state, and local 
levels. She was instrumental in my campaigns 
going back to 1976, when I was a candidate 
for the state Constitutional Convention from 
the Midtown district. She was an enthusiastic 
supporter in all my subsequent races for the 
state Senate and later for Congress with her 
prominent and well-recognized yard signs on 
McLean. Mrs. Stiles attended four Democratic 
National Conventions and two presidential in-
augurations. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland 
proclaimed February 20, 2016 ‘‘Myra Stiles 
Day’’ for her dedicated service to the city and 
its citizens. Since 2003, Mrs. Stiles had been 
an active member of Mothers of the NILE, an 
organization which works to reduce the num-
ber of children entering the juvenile justice 
system. Mrs. Stiles loved politics, the demo-
cratic process and Democratic principles and 
her community will long remember her dedi-
cated service. I extend my profound condo-
lences to her children Allison, Sarah and Rob-
ert, and their families, and to her many friends 
and colleagues. She did important work and 
will be missed. 
CELEBRATING CAIRO GEORGIA’S 
150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the City of Cairo, Georgia, 
located in Grady County, in my Congressional 
district, as they celebrate and commemorate 
their 150th Anniversary. The city was founded 
in 1835 and incorporated as a town in 1870 
and a city in 1905. In 1906, it was designated 
as the county seat for the newly formed Grady 
County. It is an honor and a privilege to have 
represented the City of Cairo since my elec-
tion to Congress in 1992. 
There was a commemoration event held on 
Monday, October 26, 2020, at 6 PM during the 
Cairo City Council Meeting. The city has 
served as the catalyst to improve the quality of 
life for thousands of citizens. 
The City of Cairo is a city that is steeped in 
a rich history and accomplishments that reflect 
the absolute best that our nation has to offer. 
Cairo, Georgia, was first settled in the early 
1800s by William Hawthorne, a Baptist 
Preacher. Hawthorne cut a forty-mile trail 
through the area. Another early settler was 
Henry Miller, who moved to what was then 
Thomas County. He had a stagecoach stop. 
By 1860, The Atlantic and Gulf Railroad had 
bought land from residents Nancy and Malachi 
Collins, as well as from Phoebe and Wash-
ington Baggett. In 1866, H.H. Tooke and 
James H. Hayes sold land so that the town 
could be founded. 
In 1862, Seaborn Anderson Roddenberry 
bought land from Mr. Miller and began his 
medical practice in a horse-drawn buggy by 
selling his open-kettle sugar cane syrup. By 
1867, Roddenberry had a medical office and 
opened a general store and people from near 
and far bought syrup from large barrels and 
filled their own jars with his molasses. The 
nickname of the local Cairo High School is the 
Syrupmakers and Syrupmaids because of the 
importance of this industry in the formation 
and vitalization of this community. The Cairo 
plant of the Roddenberry Company was 
closed in 1993, and now serves as a regional 
community center. 
The town council began meeting in 1871, 
and its first mayor was Wiley Pearce. Many 
dedicated men and women have served in 
elective office since the beginning of this his-
toric town. The city is now led by Mayor How-
ard Thrower, III, and a five-member city coun-
cil. 
The city has not strayed from the foundation 
that was set by its early leaders with an atten-
tiveness to the needs of the people above all 
else. Dr. George Washington Carver once 
said that ‘‘How far you go in life depends on 
your being tender with the young, compas-
sionate with the aged, sympathetic with the 
striving, and tolerant of the weak and strong 
because someday in your life, you will have 
been all of these.’’ 
The City of Cairo, Georgia, has overcome 
storms and difficult situations, but has stood 
the test of time. Through dedicated community 
servants, they have sought to meet the needs 
of their community and to move it forward for 
the betterment of all of its citizens. This city 
holds dear to the values that make this com-
munity and our country great—God, country, 
and family. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
this community in Congress and I look forward 
to seeing their growth and progression in the 
years to come. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in commending and congratulating the City 
of Cairo for 150 years of dedicated service to 
God, the citizens of Cairo, and humankind.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
ARMED 
FORCES DEFERRED TAX RELIEF 
ACT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Armed Forces Deferred 
Tax Relief Act, legislation that will require the 
Department of Defense (DoD) to cover any 
additional 
taxes 
incurred 
by 
our 
brave 
servicemembers as a result of President 
Trump’s reckless Presidential Memorandum 
issued on August 8, 2020. 
President Trump’s Memorandum instructed 
the Secretary of the Treasury to use his au-
thority to defer Social Security payroll taxes 
between September 1, 2020, and December 
31, 2020. The resulting Internal Revenue 
Service Notice postpones the collection of 
these taxes until the period beginning on Jan-
uary 1, 2021, and ends on April 30, 2021. This 
will result in our servicemembers paying dou-
ble the tax, or 12.4 percent, each month of the 
first quarter of 2021. 
Many private businesses have opted out of 
the deferral, but the DoD has forced our 
servicemembers to participate, sticking them 
with a large tax bill coming due in the new 
year. My legislation will require the DoD to re-
imburse our servicemembers for any addi-
tional taxes withheld as a result of this Admin-
istration’s willful ignorance.

REVEREND SH’KUR FRANCIS 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Reverend Sh’Kur Francis 
of the New Hope United Methodist Church. 
This church was founded 136 years ago, and 
Rev. Francis represents a new optimism for 
the New Hope Church. 
With an upbringing from Charleston and 
Gullah-Geechee roots, Reverend Francis rep-
resents the Lowcountry well in upstate South 
Carolina. He will celebrate his sixth year of 
ministry there on November 15, 2020. Rev-
erend Francis has been able to help the con-
gregation grow and challenge previously held 
thoughts, to great success. Since his tenure 
as minister, the church attendance rate has 
nearly tripled. 
Reverend Francis has been an activist his 
whole life and uses his ministry to talk about 
important social justice issues. His devotion 
calls to mind Isaiah 1:17, where we are told, 
‘‘Learn to do good; seek justice, correct op-
pression; bring justice to the fatherless, and 
please the widow’s cause.’’

INTRODUCTION OF THE RESOLU-
TION EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION 
OF 
THE 
MONTH OF NOVEMBER 2020 AS 
‘‘PANCREATIC 
CANCER 
AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to introduce a resolution today 
with my colleague from California and Chair-
woman of the Health Subcommittee of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, Congress-
woman ANNA ESHOO. Our resolution raises 
awareness about pancreatic cancer and the 
importance of increased Congressional fund-
ing for research by expressing support for the 
designation of the month of November 2020 
as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. I am 
also pleased that our colleague in the Senate, 
Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Is-
land, has introduced a Senate companion to 
this resolution. I am grateful for Congress-
woman ESHOO
and Senator WHITEHOUSE’s 
leadership in helping to combat pancreatic 
cancer. 
This year alone, pancreatic cancer has 
killed two American icons: our colleague Con-
gressman John Lewis and Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Pancreatic can-
cer recently killed baseball legend Bob Gib-
son, and it continues to sicken thousands of 
Americans fighting every day to survive this 
disease. This includes our colleague, Con-
gressman ALCEE HASTINGS, who is currently 
fighting a courageous battle against this hor-
rible cancer. Accurately described as a silent 
killer, this disease does not have an early de-
tection test, so unfortunately, by year’s end, 
pancreatic cancer will have killed an estimated 
47,050 Americans and is the third largest 
cause of cancer-related death in our county. 
As COVID–19 continues to rob us of more 
than 222,000 of our fellow Americans, pan-
creatic cancer continues to devastate thou-
sands of American families and communities. 
In my home state of Indiana, nearly 1,000 
Hoosiers will be killed by pancreatic cancer by 
year’s end, and almost 2,000 Hoosiers will be 
newly diagnosed with this terrible disease. Na-
tionwide, an additional 57,600 Americans will 
be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year. 
These horrific statistics highlight how few 
tools exist to detect this disease and, as a re-
sult, the immense pain and suffering it causes. 
Alarmingly, pancreatic cancer still has no early 
detection test to quickly and accurately deter-
mine the presence of this cancer. As a result, 
it is very difficult to detect this cancer before 
it has advanced to later—and more deadly— 
stages. Tragically, sixty-six percent of pan-
creatic cancer patients live less than one year 
following their diagnosis, This was the case for 
our colleague Congressman John Lewis, who 
was killed by pancreatic cancer less than a 
year following his diagnosis. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has also high-
lighted how longstanding health disparities and 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
care 
results 
in 
dispropottionate numbers of infections and 
deaths from this virus in communities of color. 
Sadly, the same is true with pancreatic can-
cer. The incidence rate for pancreatic cancer 
among Black Americans is twenty percent 
higher than that of any other racial demo-
graphic and the death rate is seventeen per-
cent higher for Black men than for white men. 
In this way, the lack of pancreatic cancer early 
detection research accelerates the racial in-
equities in our health care system, with dev-
astating consequences for minorities. 
To help detect pancreatic cancer earlier and 
to help address racial inequities, the 116th 
Congress has a unique opportunity to make 
historic investments in pancreatic cancer re-
search at the Department of Defense (DoD). 
Congress can do this by enacting the $15 mil-
lion in pancreatic cancer research funding— 
first introduced through my amendment with 
Congresswoman ESHOO—and then passed by 
the full House. Within this research funding, 
DoD will include early detection research as a 
major funding priority to help more patients 
detect this deadly disease early. In fact, if di-
agnosed early, the five-year survival rate for 
pancreatic cancer patients is above 80%. 
However, our provisions have not yet passed 
the Senate, and current pancreatic cancer re-
search funding remains at a fraction of the 
level that our fellow Americans struggling with 
this disease deserve. That’s why it is so crit-
ical that we raise awareness about how dead-
ly and destructive this cancer is to our Amer-
ican family, and why increasing pancreatic 
cancer research is critical to lowering this dis-
ease’s deadliness. 
Moreover, at a time when our country is 
having a national conversation about the deep 
disparities in access to health care for Black 
and Brown people during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Congress must do everything within 
our power to improve health outcomes through 
research and treatment, and that includes 
pancreatic cancer. And in order to ensure that 
we improve outcomes, we need to raise 
awareness with the American public and our 
colleagues in Congress about just how deadly 
this cancer is and why we need to find early 
detection tools, effective treatments and re-
duce this disease’s disproportionate impact on 
communities of color. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to sup-
port this resolution, and I urge my colleagues 
in the Senate to support our companion reso-
lution introduced by Senator WHITEHOUSE.

HONORING RONNIE LOPEZ 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Ronnie Lopez, 
who passed away on Sunday, August 23, 
2020, at the age of 73. Ronnie was an Ari-
zona trailblazer; a champion for the Latino 
community; and a consequential leader who 
broke economic, social, and political barriers 
to forge a stronger path forward for our state. 
Born in the spring of 1947, in Miami, Ari-
zona, Ronnie was quick to seize new opportu-
nities and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, at the 
age of 20, where he investigated discrimina-
tion cases for the Arizona State Civil Rights 
Commission. Ronnie’s passion for public serv-
ice took many forms—from helping launch in-
fluential organizations, such as Chicanos Por 
La Causa and Valle del Sol, to serving as a 
Justice of the Peace and eventually becoming 
the chief of staff to then-Governor Bruce Bab-
bitt. He was always at the forefront of change, 
breathing life into ideas conceived from the 
purpose of placing people above all else. 
Ronnie cherished his role as a father, 
grandfather, and husband—and to him, family 
extended beyond relatives to include friends 
and neighbors, and he wove those values 
deeply within his work to strengthen the bonds 
within our community. He committed himself to 
the causes and people he believed in, meeting 
every opportunity ‘‘all in,’’ as he would say. It’s 
what made him unique—a leader who stood 
with us regardless of the challenge, the friend 
we could count on, and the mentor we all 
looked up to. Ronnie’s relentless advocacy 
was inimitable, and it led to his lifelong friend, 
the late Representative Ed Pastor, being elect-
ed as the first Hispanic American to represent 
Arizona in Congress. While Ronnie credited 
others for his successes, insisting he stood on 
the shoulders of giants, he was always the 
first hand to reach out and lift others up with 
him. 
His legacy will forever be a part of Arizona, 
reminding us of how much stronger we all 
stand when we are ‘‘all in.’’ I thank Ronnie, 
and Godspeed.

HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 27, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Today, I rise to celebrate 
and honor the exceptional contributions of 
Margarita ‘‘Maggie’’ and Eugene Dawson III. 
This year, I was honored to nominate Maggie 
and Eugene for the 2020 Angels in Adoption 
award, which recognizes the efforts of Ameri-
cans who advocate for children in need of a 
family. 
Maggie and Eugene experienced an un-
imaginable family tragedy. They welcomed 
their eight nieces and nephews to live in their 
home just two days after the children’s mother 
lost her life at the hands of their father. The 
couple knew their nieces and nephews would 
need a home surrounded by family to heal 
from this trauma. 
Together with their two biological children, 
Maggie and Eugene have created a safe 
place and secure family unit, ensuring the chil-
dren have a chance to grow up with their sib-
lings and cousins. In 2017, Maggie and Eu-
gene were given permanent custody of the 
seven minors. 
Now, as a family of 12, the Dawsons serve 
as an inspirational example of how families 
can thrive, even in the darkest of times. They 
represent the very best of Central Washington. 
I am proud to represent them in Congress, 
and I encourage all Americans to look to the 
Dawsons as an example of what makes our 
community strong.
