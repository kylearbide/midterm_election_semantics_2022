SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2020 
(Legislative day of Monday, October 19, 2020) 
The Senate met at 12 noon, on the ex-

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, You are our God. We can stay 
composed even in a storm because of 
Your presence. We need You and stay 
thirsty for You, for Your power and 
glory uplift us. Your steadfast love is

Your Name for as long as we live. 
Lord, empower our Senators to run 
toward life’s challenges and hardships, 
knowing that they are never alone. 
Satisfy their souls with good things

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
to speak for 1 minute as in morning 
business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IOWA HARVEST SEASON 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Across Iowa this 
weekend, farmers will be in their fields 
as they continue the 2020 harvest sea-
son. Iowa farmers have now harvested 
all but about 10 percent of our soy-
beans and 30 percent of our corn. 
Because I am in Washington, DC, this 
weekend with the confirmation of 
Judge Barrett, I won’t be able to give 
my social media followers my weekly 
update 
on 
the 
2020 
hashtag 
‘‘CornWatch’’ 
or 
hashtag 
‘‘SoybeanWatch’’ 
series 
from 
the 
Grassley farm. The purpose of this 
weekly series is to give people who 
have never stepped foot on a farm an 
idea of the complexities that go into 
planning, growing, and harvesting a 
bountiful crop. 
Between COVID–19 supply chain dis-
ruptions, drought, and a derecho, the 
86,000 Iowa farm families have faced 
one of the most challenging years in 
recent memory. Farmers are only 2 
percent of the population, but they 
provide food, fuel, and fiber for the 
other 98 percent. 
I want to send my best wishes to 
farmers and their families as we are 
nearing the final stretch of the harvest 
season. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the Senate took the first step 
toward concluding our consideration of 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court. The judge 
is one of the most brilliant, admired, 
and impressive nominees for any public 
office in a generation. Tomorrow, we 
will vote on advancing her nomination 
toward final confirmation on Monday. 
Our recent debates have been heated, 
but, curiously, talk of Judge Barrett’s 
actual credentials or qualifications has 
hardly featured in it. The Democratic 
leader summarized his view yesterday: 
‘‘It’s not about qualifications’’—his 
words. 
Instead, our Democratic colleagues 
have tried to claim the Senate’s proc-
ess itself is not legitimate. These 
claims are supposed to lay groundwork 
for 
radical, 
institution-wrecking 
changes down the road. 
But, of course, they are not true. We 
live in a constitutional Republic. The 
legitimacy of an outcome does not de-
pend on the feelings it provokes in poli-
ticians. Let me say that again: The le-
gitimacy of an outcome does not de-
pend on the feelings it provokes in poli-
ticians. Legitimacy comes from prece-
dence, rules, and, ultimately, the Con-
stitution. 
Let’s restate a few facts for pos-
terity. No. 1, there is no inconsistency 
between the Republican Senate’s deci-
sion in 2016 and our decision to confirm 
Judge Barrett this year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6420 
October 24, 2020 
Here is what I said in my very first 
floor speech following the death of Jus-
tice Scalia: ‘‘The Senate has not filled 
a vacancy arising in an election year 
when there was divided government 
since 1888, almost 130 years ago’’—not 
setting some new precedent, just stat-
ing a fact. 
Fifteen times in American history, 
during a Presidential election year, 
new Supreme Court vacancies have 
arisen and Presidents have made nomi-
nations. Seven of those 15 times, voters 
had elected an opposite-party Senate 
to check and balance the sitting Presi-
dent. Not surprisingly, in those situa-
tions, only two of the seven were con-
firmed, and none since 1888. The other 
eight times, the same party controlled 
the Senate and the White House. Seven 
of those eight were confirmed—all but 
one. The one exception unraveled in a 
scandal. 
We followed precedent in 2016, and we 
are following precedent this week. 
No. 2, it has been claimed that Chair-
man GRAHAM broke the rules by report-
ing out Judge Barrett’s nomination— 
not so. As the Parliamentarian con-
firmed on Thursday, standing rule 
XXVI and Senate precedent are crystal 
clear. If a majority of a committee is 
physically present and votes in favor of 
a nomination, reporting it to the floor 
is a valid action, irrespective of what 
committee rules may say. 
Chairman GRAHAM didn’t even vio-
late the rules of his own committee. 
Past chairmen of both parties have 
done precisely what Chairman GRAHAM 
did on Thursday morning. In 2014, for 
one example, Chairman LEAHY and the 
committee’s 
Democratic 
majority 
voted multiple Federal judges to the 
floor without two members of the mi-
nority present—just a few years ago. 
Nothing remotely unprecedented took 
place—not in committee, not on the 
floor. 
No. 3, timing. Some colleagues kept 
repeating the absurd claim that this is 
the most rushed confirmation process 
in history. Well, that is flatout false. 
From the announcement of the nomi-
nation to the start of hearings, eight 
Supreme Court nominations in the last 
60 years moved more quickly than this 
one. Eight in the last 60 years moved 
more quickly than this one. Then, from 
the end of the hearing to the com-
mittee vote, half of all confirmations 
since 1916 actually moved faster than 
this one. 
Justice John Paul Stevens was con-
firmed in 19 days, from start to finish; 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, in about 
4 weeks. In the past, Justices have been 
confirmed in 1 week; some in 1 day. 
There is no argument that Judge 
Barrett’s nomination has moved at a 
breakneck pace. Facts are facts. 
No. 4, contrary to what has been 
claimed, the Senate has absolutely 
confirmed Supreme Court nominees 
later in Presidential election years 
than this one. Multiple Justices were 
confirmed after elections had already 
happened. We have had multiple Su-
preme Court Justices confirmed in De-
cember of election years. Senates have 
even confirmed nominees for lameduck 
Presidents who just lost. That is an-
other nonissue. 
All of these false claims embarrass 
those who repeat them, but the most 
important point is this: In this coun-
try, legitimacy does not flow from the 
whims of politicians. Legitimacy does 
not depend on which political party 
makes 
that 
decision. 
Legitimacy 
comes from traditions, rules, and the 
Constitution. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
spent months obsessively demanding 
that our President repeatedly acknowl-
edge that the election will be legiti-
mate even if he loses. But here in the 
Senate, with this confirmation process, 
Democrats are flunking their own test. 
Let me say that again. Democrats 
want President Trump to keep repeat-
ing that the election will be legitimate 
regardless of whether he wins, but here 
in the Senate, the very same people are 
saying our vote on Monday will only be 
valid if they like the outcome. 
Our Republic cannot abide any polit-
ical faction making ‘‘illegitimate’’ a 
sloppy 
synonym 
for 
‘‘we 
are 
not 
happy.’’ Of course, they are not happy. 
That doesn’t make anything about this 
illegitimate. 
That kind of recklessness leads down 
a road that none of us should want to 
travel. That is why I keep correcting 
the record, even though it might seem 
silly. After all, if Republicans have the 
votes, why not ignore our colleagues 
and their statements and move on? I 
have chosen not to do that. It remains 
our duty to separate right from wrong, 
fact from fiction, for the good of the 
Senate and for our country. 
Judge Barrett’s confirmation process 
has followed every rule. It has followed 
the Constitution in every respect. We 
have abided by the norms and tradi-
tions dictated by our history, and we 
are going to vote tomorrow. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just 
heard the Republican leader say there 
is no inconsistency between what the 
Republicans are doing now with Amy 
Coney Barrett’s nomination and what 
they did with Merrick Garland in 2016. 
Who would believe that? The contradic-
tion is glaring. The contradiction will 
be a stain on the leader’s forehead and 
on the entire Republican caucus if it 
continues. 
We just heard another warped, dis-
torted, and convoluted history lesson 
from Leader MCCONNELL. We know how 
defensive he is about the blatant, 180- 
degree, hypocritical turn he has made 
on Supreme Court nominations, but a 
distorted, warped history lesson will 
not remove the stain. 
Only one thing will, Leader MCCON-
NELL: Withdraw the nomination of 
Amy Coney Barrett until after the 
election, plain and simple. 
Now we meet here in a rare Saturday 
session because there is nothing—noth-
ing—remotely normal about the Re-
publicans’ drive to confirm Judge Bar-
rett to the Supreme Court only days 
before a Presidential election. 
Four years ago, the entire Repub-
lican Senate said it was a principle— 
that was their word, ‘‘principle’’—that 
Supreme Court Justices should not be 
confirmed 
in 
Presidential 
election 
years. Leader MCCONNELL said: ‘‘The 
American people [deserve a choice] in 
the selection of their next Supreme 
Court Justice.’’ That is the principle 
they insisted the Senate must follow, 
and they declared that this principle 
bound the Senate not to consider the 
nomination of Judge Garland even 
though it was 8 months before the 
Presidential election of 2016. 
Well, here we are today, just a few 
days from another Presidential elec-
tion. More than 50 million Americans 
have already voted, and that number 
will only increase between today and 
Monday—the date of Judge Barrett’s 
confirmation vote. Americans are wait-
ing in line now, patiently, at early vot-
ing locations around the country, to 
cast their ballots in Arizona and North 
Carolina, in Maine and Colorado, in 
Iowa and Kansas, in Georgia, Alaska, 
and Kentucky, in 26 States where early 
voting centers are open and in another 
15 States where early votes can be 
dropped off at election offices. 
In my home State of New York, 
where today marks the first day of 
early voting, it may look a little dif-
ferent this year. The lines are longer, 
not just because of enthusiasm but also 
because they are more socially distant. 
Everyone should be wearing a mask. 
But as we speak, millions of Americans 
are using their voices to say who they 
want to have select Supreme Court 
Justices. 
At the same time, when the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate is ram-
ming through the lifetime appointment 
of a Justice who will make hugely 
impactful decisions about their lives 
and freedom, Leader MCCONNELL has 
the temerity to say there is no con-
tradiction between Merrick Garland 
and how they treated him and Amy 
Coney Barrett and how they are treat-
ing her. Give me a break. Our col-
leagues are saying to the American 
people: You get no say. You get no 
choice. 
Four years ago, when a Democratic 
President nominated a Justice, the Re-
publicans professed to care about giv-
ing the American people a voice—not 
so now, not when a Republican-nomi-
nated Justice is on the line, not when 
their own political power is at stake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6421 
October 24, 2020 
What became of that high-minded prin-
ciple the Republican Senators em-
braced so fervently in somber tones? 
Just 4 years ago, Leader MCCONNELL 
and they told the Nation that the Sen-
ate must heed the voices of the Amer-
ican people when they vote. Where on 
Earth did that principle go? What prin-
ciples govern their current mad rush to 
confirm another Trump Justice 8 days 
before this Presidential election? 
If this process has revealed anything, 
it is that the supposed Republican prin-
ciple was a farce—no principle at all 
and never was. It was a naked, oppor-
tunistic, transparent, cynical, last- 
ditch grab for power. Of course, it is 
the continuation of their shameful, 
lockstep 
subservience 
to 
President 
Trump—the most unprincipled Presi-
dent in American history. This will go 
down as the most partisan, most hypo-
critical, and least legitimate Supreme 
Court nomination in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Once again, Leader MCCONNELL, when 
you talk about history—a distorted, 
one-sided view, that is all you give—it 
doesn’t erase what you have done. It 
stares the American people in the face. 
They know it. We know it. We all know 
it, and history will know it. 
It is a very dark moment for the Sen-
ate, and I am ashamed that the Repub-
licans are going along with this. This, 
again, will be the most partisan, most 
hypocritical, and least legitimate Su-
preme Court confirmation in our Na-
tion’s history. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 925 
Mr. President, now let’s look at the 
status of our country. It is even less 
justified in light of that. 
We had a record number of COVID in-
fections yesterday. Let me repeat—a 
record number. Are Senate Republicans 
doing anything about that? No. This is 
not a regional crisis like before. These 
spikes are now widespread, across the 
whole country, putting all of our Na-
tion at risk. In fact, in per capita 
terms, I believe North and South Da-
kota have the highest in the Nation. I 
read this morning that beds are run-
ning out, and we are not doing a thing. 
In the past month, there has been a 
35-percent increase in the number of 
Americans hospitalized with COVID. 
COVID is now the third leading cause 
of death in the United States. In coun-
tries like Germany and Japan and Aus-
tralia, COVID isn’t close to being in 
the top 10. Experts like Dr. Fauci are 
predicting, 
unfortunately, 
or 
pro-
jecting that we could hit 400,000 Amer-
ican deaths this year and that the 
darkest and worst days of this pan-
demic, unfortunately, are ahead of us, 
not behind us. 
The next huge wave of this pandemic 
is not looming; it is here. We cannot af-
ford to wait, but are the Republicans 
doing anything about it? No. There are 
tens of millions of Americans out of 
work, and businesses are failing every 
day. Are Senate Republicans doing 
anything about that? No. There are for-
eign powers, particularly Russia, try-
ing to undermine our elections. Are the 
Republicans 
doing 
anything 
about 
that? No. They are too focused on im-
plementing 
their 
deeply 
unpopular 
agenda through the courts because 
they know they could never get it 
through the Senate. Most of them 
wouldn’t even vote for it. 
Today, we are going to give the Re-
publican majority in the Senate the op-
portunity to consider critical legisla-
tion that has, so far, languished in 
Leader MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard. Many bills that are just sitting 
here, awaiting action, that were passed 
in the House—many with bipartisan 
support—are waiting for Senate action. 
We should be doing that, not rushing 
through this nomination while people 
are voting and wanting their choices to 
be listened to, not the Republican Sen-
ate’s choice. 
So we are going to start with com-
prehensive legislation that addresses 
the 
most 
serious 
problems 
facing 
America right now, the Heroes Act, 
which would deliver urgent and nec-
essary relief to the Nation and to the 
people who are suffering. The Heroes 
Act would have a comprehensive re-
gime for testing and tracing of $75 bil-
lion—the money that is needed but 
that this administration never gave. In 
fact, there is $9 billion sitting there 
from what we approved months ago in 
the CARES Act that they have not 
even given out yet, so incompetent are 
they. 
I saw Donald Trump in the debate. 
He said: Oh, it will go away. He has 
been saying that since January. That 
is why people know he is an incom-
petent President during the most dif-
ficult of times. Yet he still says it. 
We need that money. We need money 
to open up our schools safely and 
soundly. That takes extra money. The 
school districts can’t afford it. We need 
ventilation, more buses, PPE, often-
times more teachers, hotspots so that 
people can get Wi-Fi when they don’t 
have it in their own homes, and so 
much more. 
We need money to prevent people 
from being evicted from their houses. 
They have lost their jobs through no 
fault of their own, and they are getting 
kicked out either as a renter or as a 
mortgagor. The Heroes Act deals with 
that. 
We need money to help our small 
businesses—and not just a few. The res-
taurants, stages and venues, broad-
casters and newspapers, nonprofits and 
rural hospitals—all left out of the Re-
publicans’ proposal—are in the Heroes 
bill. 
There is money for unemployment. 
The $600 pandemic unemployment kept 
10 million people out of poverty. It has 
pumped money into the economy as 
well as given people who are not 
wealthy at all an ability to get by. 
That is in the Heroes bill, and there is 
so much more. 
There is money to make sure our 
elections are guarded and safe. There 
are provisions that allow for the census 
to be counted in a fair way. 
All of that is in the Heroes bill. The 
American people so much want us to 
pass it, but Leader MCCONNELL will not 
even put it on the floor for a debate. 
If Leader MCCONNELL and his Repub-
lican majority had an ounce of concern 
for average American families, they 
would halt this sham Supreme Court 
process and join us in taking up the 
critical pieces of legislation which my 
colleagues and I will be putting on the 
floor all afternoon. In each case, we are 
not asking the Senate to pass it; we are 
simply asking to debate it. We are ask-
ing them to overrule Leader MCCON-
NELL and put these bills on the floor 
and let there be a debate and let there 
be amendments. That is all we ask dur-
ing the most desperate—desperate—of 
times. 
All we ask is for the ability to debate 
something that really matters to the 
American people instead of rushing 
through a judge, a Supreme Court 
nominee, when the American people 
want the decision to be made by them, 
not by Republican Senators, not when 
her views on key issues only represent 
an extreme minority of the American 
people. 
Mr. President, in order to proceed to 
the consideration of H.R. 925, Heroes 2, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The majority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, the minority leader 
is requesting to move to legislation 
after having repeatedly, this week, re-
quested and asked for votes to adjourn 
multiple times—leave town. Now, all of 
a sudden, he wants to legislate. 
I think there is a serious question 
about the sincerity of the minority 
leader’s request here. And, frankly, to 
his point, the U.S. Senate has now 
twice—and most recently this week, on 
Tuesday—Tuesday this week—voted on 
legislation that would do all the things 
that he says that he wants to do: Help 
people who are unemployed; we voted 
on a bill that had unemployment insur-
ance for people who are unemployed. 
Help small businesses; we had a bipar-
tisan agreement on the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program to provide assistance 
to small businesses, and that was 
blocked by the Democrats earlier this 
week. It had money in there, resources 
on a bipartisan, agreed-upon objective, 
and that is more money, more re-
sources, for schools and universities to 
open safely—$100 billion in there for 
schools to open safely. They blocked it. 
They objected. 
It had money in there for farmers, 
something that is important to the 
Presiding Officer and to me as well. 
They blocked it. 
It had money in there for the Postal 
Service, something that his side has 
been saying repeatedly we need to ad-
dress. They blocked it. We had that 
vote this week. 
We have taken up legislation exactly 
along the lines of what the Democratic

October 24, 2020 
leader is asking for, and they have con-
sistently blocked it. 
And then to say: Well, let’s adjourn; 
we have had multiple votes on adjourn-
ing. This isn’t serious, and he knows it. 
This is all about politics. This is a 
bogus issue to detract the Senate from 
the work at hand, which is to confirm 
a well-qualified judge to the Supreme 
Court, who had a ‘‘well qualified’’ rec-
ommendation from the American Bar 
Association, 
which 
the 
Democratic 
leader in the past has said is the gold 
standard—the gold standard when it 
comes to processing and considering ju-
dicial nominations. So let’s see this for 
what it is, call it out for what it is. 
And the bill he is calling up, by the 
way, from the House of Representa-
tives, if you look at all the stuff it has 
in it—and this is the all-or-nothing ap-
proach that they are advocating right 
now—tax cuts for Manhattan million-
aires? They are always complaining 
about tax cuts for the rich. This is tax 
cuts for millionaires in New York and 
California. Blue State bailouts for his 
State of New York. Think about that. 
Is that really what the American peo-
ple think we ought to be voting on 
right now when they are unemployed, 
small businesses need help? 
And that is the other thing. The bill 
he is calling up—trying to call up right 
now has no assistance in there for the 
PPP program, the very program that 
everybody around the country has said 
has provided enormous assistance to 
small businesses, kept them in busi-
ness, and there are other businesses 
who need that help. He talked about 
wanting to help businesses that are 
going out of business. Well, that bill 
that he is trying to call up right now 
doesn’t include assistance for small 
businesses. 
So, anyway, this is clearly an at-
tempt to detract the Senate from the 
work at hand, which is to consider a 
very well-qualified nominee to the U.S. 
Supreme Court—one of the Senate’s 
most important constitutional duties 
and responsibilities, and we intend to 
stay focused on that. 
And if the leader is genuinely inter-
ested, he could let us get on the bill 
that we tried to call up earlier this 
week 
that 
deals 
with 
all 
the 
coronavirus relief issues that he men-
tioned earlier, all of which are bipar-
tisan issues—every single one of them 
on that list. But that isn’t what this is 
about. This is about politics. 
So, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just a 
few quick points. 
No. 1, no one is—we are not talking 
about, and the American people are not 
about qualifications. We are talking 
about views on issues. 
Do the American people want their 
healthcare taken away from them? 
Amy Coney Barrett has said that she 
disagrees with the decision to keep it. 
Do the American people—do Amer-
ican women want the right to choose 
taken away from them? Amy Coney 
Barrett, in the past, has said she would 
do that. 
Do the American people want to 
make it even harder to form a union so 
they might get some good pay? Amy 
Coney Barrett. How about gun safety? 
She is to the right of Scalia. 
The issue on Amy Coney Barrett is 
twofold, and nothing they say changes 
it. No. 1, her views on the issues are so 
far and so extreme that she does not 
represent even the views of the people 
in this body on the Republican side; 
and, No. 2, if they feel that the Amer-
ican people want her, let them vote and 
decide—the very same thing my friend 
from South Dakota and everyone else 
said with Merrick Garland. We know 
hypocrisy when we see it. We know 
contradictions when we see them. 
And on the bill—yes, let’s debate it. 
But their bill is inadequate on testing, 
inadequate on small business, inad-
equate on schools. We went to school 
administrators. No money for State 
and local governments, and I dare say 
to my friend from South Dakota, a po-
lice officer, a firefighter, someone who 
picks up the garbage or drives the 
buses needs help in South Dakota, if it 
is a red State, or New York, if it is a 
blue State. It is despicable, when the 
bill goes for all States, to say: ‘‘It is 
just for blue States.’’ That is the kind 
of divisiveness that Donald Trump has 
created in this country. It is why so 
many people don’t like him, and what 
our Republican colleagues, unfortu-
nately, since he has become President, 
have followed through on. 
Our bill is far more comprehensive. It 
deals with the needs. Very little money 
for testing, very little money for State 
and local governments, no money to 
help restaurants or stages or non-
profits or rural hospitals, no money for 
hospitals, in general. 
So the bottom line is very simple. 
Ours is a broad, comprehensive bill. 
Theirs is a narrow, skinny bill done to 
appease 20 Republican Senators who 
wanted no money—no money. And they 
won’t even debate that either. 
So I say to my good friend from 
South Dakota, and he is my friend, we 
have one view. The American people 
are for a $2 trillion bill, a recent poll 
showed—60, 70 percent. They have a 
much narrower view, based on a hard- 
right philosophy. 
Bring this bill to the floor, and let’s 
debate it. It passed the House. It is the 
only thing that has a chance of getting 
done, and if you want to make amend-
ments to cut back on the money and 
help we need, we welcome that debate, 
but don’t just block something that 
has a real chance of becoming law as 
opposed to the farcical exercise they 
engaged in on Tuesday on a totally 
partisan bill that got not a single 
Democratic vote. Let’s have a debate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I could 
just make one quick observation here, 
first off, the funding that was provided 
in the Republican bill wasn’t incon-
sequential. It was $650 billion. 
And to the Democratic leader’s point 
about the people in this country want 
what is now a $2.4 trillion bill—boy, I 
can tell you, I haven’t seen that any-
where, and maybe there is some polling 
out there that indicates that. But I 
think if you ask the question: Would 
you want to spend $2.4 trillion dollars 
if you knew you were borrowing it 
from your children and grandchildren, 
you might get a different answer. 
And the truth of the matter is, we 
have gone $3.5 trillion—all borrowed 
money, all added to the debt—already 
to address coronavirus relief. 
That being said, we did bring a bill 
up that was another $650 billion, and 
the Democrats blocked it. Why? Be-
cause it didn’t spend enough, and they 
didn’t think it spent enough on the 
things that they thought it ought to 
spend money on. 
Well, if that is the debate, let’s get 
on our bill. Let’s start at the $650 bil-
lion base level, and they can offer 
amendments to increase funding. 
By the way, we did have funding in 
there for testing and vaccines—signifi-
cant amounts of money negotiated by 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER, the chairman of 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. But if that is what 
they want to do, then let’s start there, 
and then they can have an opportunity 
to debate it and offer amendments, but 
they have blocked even getting on the 
bill—not the bill itself, even debating 
it. 
So when he says: We want to have a 
debate, we could have had a debate. All 
they had to do was let us get on the 
bill, and then we could be offering up 
and debating and discussing these var-
ious amendments that they want to 
offer. 
But I would argue that all the things 
that our bill includes are things that 
are important to the American people. 
It was a targeted bill. It was a fiscally 
responsible bill. And, yes, it got 52 out 
of 53 Republicans to vote for it—not a 
single Democrat. Why? Because the 
Democrats have an all-or-nothing ap-
proach, and they want to hold this 
process hostage to get a leftwing agen-
da of items included in the legislation, 
many of which—many of which have no 
relationship 
whatsoever 
to 
the 
coronavirus. 
So the leader’s point—and, by the 
way, with respect to the judge, yes, 
Judge Barrett is, I think, everything 
that the American people want to see 
in a Supreme Court Justice. And for 
him to get up here and say that she 
doesn’t have views that are supported 
by the American people, I don’t under-
stand exactly that argument because 
my understanding of what a judge is 
supposed to do is to take the facts of 
the case, apply the law, apply the Con-
stitution in an impartial way, and 
apply those as written—not to try and 
get some perceived outcome or result 
or policy preference. That is not what 
judges do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6423 
October 24, 2020 
What you heard him say is exactly 
why we have a difference of opinion 
about the judiciary in this country be-
cause they view the judiciary as an 
auxiliary legislature where you go to 
get outcomes and results that you 
can’t get through the two political 
branches of our Government. 
Well, that is not what the judiciary 
is. The judiciary is supposed to be inde-
pendent. It is supposed to be a fair ar-
biter—it calls balls and strikes and 
doesn’t try and step on the scales or 
write the rules of the game. That is 
what a judge is supposed to be. 
So they don’t like this Justice or this 
judge, I should say—hopefully, soon to 
be Justice—because they think she is 
going to rule a certain way on par-
ticular cases, and they have no idea 
about that. 
I mean, think about it. The same ar-
gument has been made against Repub-
lican nominees to the Supreme Court, 
literally, for the last 30 or 40 years. 
Every single time a Republican Presi-
dent nominates an individual to the 
Supreme Court, the Democrats and the 
left get up and say: They are going to 
cut healthcare. They are going to de-
stroy healthcare. They were saying 
that about Justices on the Supreme 
Court that vote with their wing more 
than anybody else. They said that 
about Chief Justice Roberts. He was 
going to kill healthcare. He was going 
to destroy healthcare for millions of 
Americans. 
He cast the deciding vote to uphold 
the Affordable Care Act, otherwise 
known as ObamaCare. 
So they don’t know what a judge is 
going to do. But I know what she is 
going to do because she has proven it 
as a judge on the appellate circuit, the 
Seventh Circuit, as an academic, in her 
writings, that she believes the role of a 
judge is to take the facts of a case, 
apply the law, apply the Constitution, 
as written, impartially, and to render a 
decision. 
That, to me, is what I think every 
American believes we ought to have in 
a Supreme Court Justice. So, yes, this 
may be fair game for them to come 
down here and offer up all these mo-
tions that we are going to hear repet-
itively today, none of which has any-
thing to do with the issues that they 
are going to say they want to talk 
about but everything to do with the 
fact that we are considering an incred-
ibly well-qualified—not by my opinion 
but by everybody who has ever worked 
with her, including the dean of the 
Notre Dame Law School who hired her, 
the ABA—the American Bar Associa-
tion—which passes judgment on all 
these nominees, her colleagues on the 
Seventh Circuit, staff, everybody this 
person has ever interacted with, stellar 
recommendations. This is an incredibly 
qualified individual and somebody, by 
the way, who I think can be relatable 
to the American people because she 
deals with the same issues that all 
Americans do, trying to raise seven 
kids. Imagine that. 
Imagine trying to organize her sched-
ule around seven kids, continue to be a 
professional, and do exceptional work. 
She is highly qualified, a ‘‘towering 
intellect,’’ she has been described by 
her colleagues. 
So that is what this is about. It is 
about trying to block a well-qualified 
Justice to the Supreme Court simply 
because they don’t like the process. 
And I understand that, but this is a 
constitutional process. This is a va-
cancy. 
The Constitution doesn’t follow the 
political calendar when it comes to fill-
ing vacancies, and, as you heard Leader 
MCCONNELL
point out earlier today, 
precedent on this issue, on confirming 
a nominee by a President to a vacancy 
created in an election year, the prece-
dent falls all one way, if you go back 
throughout history. 
So just so people know, every time 
they get up and offer a unanimous con-
sent request to call up a piece of legis-
lation, it has nothing to do with the 
legislation, because they have already 
moved to adjourn multiple times this 
week, meaning they want to get out of 
town. They don’t want anything to do 
with this Supreme Court. So they are 
going to get up and say Republicans 
are blocking this or that. As I pointed 
out, the first one that was offered was 
a bill to deal with the coronavirus and 
provide relief to people across this 
country, which, by the way, we just 
voted on 2 days ago—3 days ago here in 
the U.S. Senate. They blocked even 
getting on the bill—not considering the 
substance of it, which, by the way, as I 
said, includes a lot of bipartisan objec-
tives and priorities; they blocked even 
considering. 
So that is what this is about, and I 
expect that is what we are going to 
hear today, tomorrow, and the next 
day, but it is not going to deter us from 
the important work we have at hand. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully to the Senator from 
Kentucky in his statement on the floor 
this morning. It was a lengthy defense 
of the procedure that is being followed 
in terms of the nomination of Amy 
Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. It 
is not the first time he has made this 
historic defense, and clearly he is going 
to continue. He obviously feels that he 
is on the defense when it comes to ex-
plaining. I think he is. I think every-
one remembers Merrick Garland and 
the pronouncement by Senator MCCON-
NELL and all of the Republican Sen-
ators that Barack Obama did not have 
the authority in the last year in office 
to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. 
We sent the name ‘‘Merrick Garland’’ 
to the Hill. Senator MCCONNELL let the 
word go out that he would not even 
meet with the man in his office. He 
would not show him the respect of 
meeting with him. Two or three Repub-
lican Senators broke with that com-
mand from Senator MCCONNELL. Most 
went right along. It was a very low mo-
ment. It is one we haven’t forgotten 
and I don’t believe the American peo-
ple have forgotten, because we have re-
written the rules. Now when it comes 
to a Republican President, Senator 
MCCONNELL says, why, of course he can 
fill the vacancy. He can even fill it 
while votes are being cast in his reelec-
tion campaign. It is an enormous de-
parture from 4 years ago, and Senator 
MCCONNELL comes to the floor regu-
larly to try to explain it away, and it 
just doesn’t work. He will keep trying. 
He has no alternative. 
But if most Americans tuned in to 
this session this morning and after-
noon, I am not sure they would dwell 
on the rules of the Senate or the rules 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
They would probably be asking them-
selves and members of their family a 
very basic question: What is wrong 
with the Senate? Doesn’t the U.S. Sen-
ate know what is going on across 
America? 
This morning’s New York Times 
front page: ‘‘New Peak for US Cases: 
Over 82,000 in a Single Day. 13 States 
Endure Their Worst Week Yet—Warn-
ings of a Cold-Weather Surge.’’ 
The article—of course referring to 
COVID–19—says: 
The United States is in the midst of one of 
the most severe surges of the coronavirus to 
date, with more new cases reported across 
the country on Friday than on any other sin-
gle day since the pandemic began.’’ 
We sit here arguing about the rules 
of the committee and the rules of the 
Senate and who came first and who 
shot 
whom. 
The 
American 
people 
would like us to focus on something 
that has real relevance to their lives. 
Listen to some of the things that 
were reported this morning in this 
newspaper about what is going on 
across America when it comes to this 
coronavirus: 
On Thursday, the same day that 
President Trump said the coronavirus 
was ‘‘going away’’ and Joseph Biden 
warned of a ‘‘dark winter ahead,’’ the 
United States recorded one of its high-
est daily totals of new cases—75,064. By 
Friday evening, a new peak in the pan-
demic had been reached when more 
than 82,000 cases in a single day were 
reported 
nationwide, 
breaking 
the 
daily record set on July 16 by more 
than 3,000 cases. Thirteen States have 
had more new infections in the past 
week than in any other 7-day stretch. 
Hotspots are emerging across the coun-
try. Officials in Kentucky—Kentucky— 
announced more than 1,470 cases on 
Thursday, the biggest 1-day jump in 
that State. More than 1,300 cases re-
ported in Colorado—another single day 
record. In the State of Washington, 
Governor Jay Inslee tweeted that the 
State had passed the 100,000-case mark, 
adding that ‘‘we all need to commit to 
having fewer, shorter, safer inter-
actions, especially as the weather 
keeps us inside more often. 
Mr. President, that is what is hap-
pening in America. It is not what is

October 24, 2020 
happening on the floor of the Senate. 
We are embroiled in a political con-
troversy over a Supreme Court nomi-
nee instead of focusing on the deadly 
situation that is going on across our 
Nation. 
I have spoken to Governor Pritzker, 
the Governor of Illinois, regularly 
about his battle to try to find equip-
ment and treatment for the people in 
our State. It is a lonely, unpopular bat-
tle that he fights. This Governor in Il-
linois and Governors across the Nation 
have to stand up—if they are respon-
sible—have to stand up and say to the 
people, the residents of their States, 
some things they don’t want to hear. 
I don’t like wearing these masks— 
most people don’t—but it is a simple, 
effective way to dramatically decrease 
the spread of this virus. I don’t like the 
notion of social distancing, and I cer-
tainly don’t like the idea of being away 
from my grandkids and the rest of my 
family, but if it means keeping them 
alive, I will do it, as painful as it may 
be. These are the simple, basic things 
that we are now debating from one end 
of America to the other. 
This 
coronavirus 
situation 
has 
reached such a terrible state that yes-
terday, when the director of public 
health for the State of Illinois gave her 
daily briefing—Dr. Ezike is her name. 
She is a wonderful African-American 
doctor who has just been steadfast 
through this whole battle against the 
pandemic. In the middle of her presen-
tation about what was facing our 
State, she broke down crying. I would 
have too. She turned her back for a 
moment and tried to compose herself. 
She could barely finish her press con-
ference. She begged the people of my 
State of Illinois: Please, if for no other 
reason, for the sake of the healthcare 
professionals who risk their lives to 
treat these people, please help us put 
an end to this virus. 
Last Saturday, a week ago today, one 
of my dear friends for years and years 
was feeling sick. She called her daugh-
ter and said: I think I need to go to the 
hospital. Her daughter took her to the 
major hospital not far from their home 
for admission because of lung prob-
lems. The hospital would not accept 
her. All the rooms were full. She then 
went to the second largest hospital in 
the area, asking if she could be admit-
ted and treated. They would not accept 
her. All the rooms were full. She fi-
nally made it into the third hospital. 
She survived until Tuesday morning, 
when she passed away. 
In the United States of America, that 
someone who had health insurance, 
was prepared to pay, could not even be 
admitted to major hospitals because of 
this coronavirus pandemic—and we are 
sitting here on the floor arguing about 
who was appointed by which President 
100 years ago? Do you wonder why peo-
ple look at the Senate and say: You are 
irrelevant. You are not even addressing 
the issues we care about. 
And the procedural play here means 
nothing. Oh, I offered an amendment, 
and you voted no. People, at the bot-
tom line, say: Grow up and do some-
thing to help America. 
We know what it takes to reach an 
agreement, as we found on March 26 
when we passed the CARES Act. It 
passed in the Senate by a vote of 96 to 
nothing—a bipartisan, strong vote, not 
a single dissenting vote—$3.3 trillion to 
address this pandemic and our econ-
omy. We rose to the occasion. I went 
home, and people were amazed. You 
mean you actually did something in 
the Senate? Yes, we did. 
How did we reach that point? It 
wasn’t through the regular order; it 
was through honest, serious negotia-
tion that took place between the White 
House and the leaders in Congress. But 
since then—since then—we have not 
seen that. There has been one group 
who has stayed away from all of the 
negotiations around the table. The 
White 
House 
is 
there. 
Secretary 
Mnuchin is there. Speaker PELOSI is 
there. CHUCK SCHUMER, the Democratic 
leader of the Senate, is there. The Re-
publicans have refused to sit down and 
negotiate at the table. 
That is how it gets done around here. 
People sit down and work out their dif-
ferences and put a bill on the floor and 
pass it 96 to nothing. But Senator 
MCCONNELL has steadfastly refused to 
attend 
these 
negotiating 
sessions. 
KEVIN
MCCARTHY, the House Repub-
lican leader, joins him. So they boycott 
the sessions and come to the floor with 
a take-it-or-leave-it, partisan amend-
ment in order to cover some political 
concerns back home. What a shame. 
What a waste. 
When Senator MCCONNELL announced 
just a few days ago to the White House, 
stop negotiating; there will be no bill 
before the election; there will be no 
COVID relief before the election, peo-
ple back in Illinois said to me: What is 
he thinking? Doesn’t he understand the 
reality of what is going on in States 
like Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and 
across the Nation, the infection rate, 
the death rate, hospitals being pushed 
to the limit? No. Clearly that is not a 
priority for Senator MCCONNELL and 
Senate Republicans. The priority is not 
the millions who are at risk. The pri-
ority is not the hundreds who are 
dying. The priority is one Supreme 
Court nominee. So we are bound to 
spend 5 straight days on that issue and 
not a minute of that time dealing with 
COVID–19. How do you explain that to 
the American people? I don’t believe 
you can. 
I could go through the lengthy his-
tory—I will put it in the record—of this 
Barrett nomination, but I will just 
state that when it comes right down to 
it, we cannot explain how we are going 
to leave here Monday night voting on 
one nominee but empty-handed when it 
comes to COVID–19. There is no ex-
cuse—no excuse for that. That is where 
we find ourselves. 
I want to tell a story on why the 
nomination of Amy Coney Barrett di-
rectly links up with my concern about 
this pandemic. Having lost 220,000 
American lives, my concern and the 
concern of everyone is to keep our fam-
ilies safe. The first question we ask one 
another is, You do have health insur-
ance, don’t you? It is the obvious ques-
tion. 
I remember a time in my own life, 
newly married, law student, my wife 
and I blessed with a little girl who 
came pretty quickly, and she was pret-
ty sick, and we had no health insur-
ance—no health insurance. She was 
treated by local hospitals here in 
Washington, where I was going to law 
school, and they called me in one day 
and said: Well, since you don’t have 
any health insurance, you have three 
options: You can declare bankruptcy 
with all these medical bills. 
I said: That doesn’t sound right to 
me. I haven’t even taken the bank-
ruptcy course in law school. What else? 
Well, you could file—we think you 
qualify for welfare, Medicaid. 
That doesn’t sound right either. I am 
training to be a lawyer. I am supposed 
to end up with a good paying job at 
some point in my life. Going on welfare 
in law school? What is the other op-
tion? 
Well, the only other option is, we will 
total up all your bills, and you can pay 
them back to us over a period of years. 
It took us 10 years—10 years to pay 
those bills because I had no health in-
surance. Did I remember that moment? 
I remembered it for the rest of my life, 
to be a father and a husband without 
health insurance and a sick baby, 
thinking, my goodness, is this going to 
keep the good doctors away? Will she 
get the treatment she needs to survive? 
That is what we are up against now, 
because the Affordable Care Act, which 
I voted for 10 years ago on this floor, 
extended health insurance to 23 million 
Americans—600,000 in the State of Illi-
nois—and it changed health insurance 
for everybody because now the health 
insurance companies have lost some of 
their tricks of the trade. They can no 
longer put a lifetime limit on how 
much they pay out. They can no longer 
discriminate against a person because 
they happen to be a woman. They can 
no longer discriminate based on pre-
existing conditions. They have to pro-
vide family health insurance, the op-
tion to keep kids on the policy until 
they reach the age of 26. That affects 
all policies. 
So what has been the approach of the 
Republicans, particularly this Presi-
dent? He wants to eliminate that. What 
I have just described, he wants to 
eliminate. Don’t take my word for it; it 
has been filed in a case across the 
street, Texas v. California. A group of 
Republican attorneys general came for-
ward and said: We want to eliminate 
the Affordable Care Act. And the Presi-
dent said: I am going to join you. Let’s 
get rid of it. 
They tried to, on the Senate floor, in 
2017. It is one of those moments etched 
in my memory, sitting down there at 
that desk. I looked at that door over

October 24, 2020 
there, and it opened at 1:30 a.m., and 
John McCain, Republican Senator from 
Arizona, walked through that door, 
stood in the well. He could barely lift 
that right arm, which had been shat-
tered when he was a prisoner of war. He 
lifted it just enough to say ‘‘no.’’ That 
‘‘no’’ saved the Affordable Care Act 
from being eliminated by the Senate. 
So where do they turn if they can’t 
get it done in Congress? Off to the 
courts. And why is that important in 
terms of this nomination of Amy 
Coney Barrett? Because they are bound 
and determined to fill that vacancy on 
the Court before November 10. Why No-
vember 10? Because that is the day the 
Court takes up the oral arguments on 
the future of the Affordable Care Act. 
And if she is not in her black robe lis-
tening to that argument, by tradition 
she can’t vote on whether to eliminate 
it or not. 
She sent plenty of signals in the past 
about what she feels about the Afford-
able Care Act. To my friend from 
South Dakota who says, ‘‘You don’t 
know how she is going to rule,’’ there 
is some truth to that. She could change 
her mind. But I will tell you, if you 
were a betting person, you would say 
the statements that she made criti-
cizing Chief Justice Roberts for saving 
the Affordable Care Act and other 
statements that she has made about 
the law itself suggest that she will not 
be a friend when she has the oppor-
tunity to vote. 
Do we take that seriously on behalf 
of 600,000 people in Illinois? You bet we 
do. It directly relates to this pandemic 
and the opportunity for people across 
this country to have the coverage they 
need. 
I am going to tell a quick story about 
one of them. I have a photo of her here 
that I want to share with people. It is 
a situation that she faces. I am sorry 
that I don’t have that in front of me, 
but I am going to tell the story any-
way, as I remember it. 
Her last name is Danenberger. She is 
from New Berlin, IL. She is an amazing 
young woman. She is battling breast 
cancer. 
Here it is. Thank you. 
When we cut corners when it comes 
to the Affordable Care Act, Susan 
Danenberger is one of the victims. She 
is a fifth-generation farmer and wine 
maker. She has a great little vineyard 
and a great little restaurant, and I 
have been out there with my family. 
She is also a two-time cancer fighter 
with stage IV metastatic breast cancer. 
She has been through the gauntlet of 
medical procedures, treatments, and 
complications of recent years—a dou-
ble mastectomy, radiation, IV, chemo, 
pulmonary embolisms, lung infections, 
and more. Her oral chemo medications 
alone have cost her thousands of dol-
lars every single month, even with in-
surance. 
As a business owner, Susan offers in-
surance to her employees. She was re-
lieved to learn, when opening her new 
health policy, that the ACA guarantees 
that she gets coverage even with that 
medical history. It also allows her 23- 
year-old son to stay on the family plan. 
Here is what she says to me: 
Most of the time I feel driven. Making wine 
and running a winery is more than just a job. 
It’s my purpose. I am more scared than I pre-
tend to be, and that is how I make it 
through. I pretend that everything is OK. 
But this year, it is harder to pretend that ev-
erything is going to be OK. I am worried 
about the future. I am worried about money. 
I am worried that I won’t be able to afford to 
fight cancer. I am worried about taxes, 
health insurance changes, and being at the 
mercy of insurance companies. 
For Americans like Susan, with a 
family, a business, and preexisting con-
ditions, there is so much at stake with 
this case pending before the Supreme 
Court and the judges and Justices who 
will vote on it. 
Susan, bless you—she just can’t af-
ford for this Court to strike down the 
Affordable Care Act. Where will she 
turn? 
Oh, but you must conclude it. Dur-
bin, you are not telling us the whole 
story. Tell us about the Republican al-
ternative to the Affordable Care Act. 
Tell us about their substitute, the one 
that is going to save everybody so 
much money and provide all the same 
coverage—tell us about that. Well, I 
sure would like to, but I can’t because 
it has never been written down on 
paper, ever. There is no Republican al-
ternative. They are bound and deter-
mined to kill ObamaCare with no sub-
stitute. That is why John McCain 
voted no. He said: We owe it to the 
American people to give them an alter-
native. Sadly, sadly, unfortunately, 
there is still no alternative. 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
earlier 
today, 
noted that there are a lot of other 
things we should be taking up at this 
moment in time. I am going to men-
tion a few here this morning. These are 
measures which passed the House of 
Representatives 
sometimes 
months 
ago, sometimes over a year ago, and 
sent to the desk of Senator MCCON-
NELL. They were never taken up. They 
have been sitting there while we have 
done little or nothing on the floor of 
the Senate except entertain his judi-
cial nominations. 
The first one is personal to me—not 
that it affects me personally or legally, 
but it is related to a bill that I intro-
duced a long time ago. On June 4, 2019, 
the House of Representatives passed 
H.R. 6, the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act, with a strong bipartisan vote, 
giving a path to citizenship to Dream-
ers. I introduced the first DREAM Act 
19 years ago. I have been reintroducing 
on this ever since. 
These are young immigrants brought 
to the United States as toddlers, in-
fants, and children. The Dream and 
Promise Act has now been sitting on 
Senator MCCONNELL’s desk for more 
than a year—more than a year. On 
June 22, I sent a letter signed by all the 
Democratic Senators calling on Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to finally bring it up 
for a vote, and, 4 months later, Senator 
MCCONNELL has not even responded. 
We sent our letter after the Supreme 
Court rejected President Trump’s ef-
fort to end deportation protections for 
Dreamers. In the opinion by Chief Jus-
tice Roberts, here is what he said about 
the actions of the Trump administra-
tion on DACA. Here is what he said: ar-
bitrary and capricious. That was the 
description. 
I joined with Senator Dick Lugar, a 
Republican, years ago, asking for the 
President to create DACA. President 
Obama responded by creating it by Ex-
ecutive order. Sadly, President Trump 
eliminated it, and, literally, hundreds 
of thousands of young people have 
their fate in doubt because of it. 
The same thing is true when it comes 
to temporary protected status for peo-
ple in the United States. 
This 
administration 
has 
been 
a 
scourge when it comes to the issue of 
immigration, particularly inspired by 
Stephen Miller, a person I could never, 
ever understand. They have decided to 
be as mean as possible and cruel when 
it comes to people who are in this 
country 
having 
left 
horrible 
cir-
cumstances at home. 
Now is the time for us to take up this 
measure and to start the debate. It 
isn’t as if we have so much else to do. 
What we should be doing is to make 
sure that we do this. 
So, in order to proceed in consider-
ation of H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act, I ask unanimous con-
sent the Senate proceed to legislative 
session. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
JOHNSON). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I have only been 
here a little under 2 years, and in the 
time that I have been here, it has been 
disappointing that when it comes to 
real 
attempts 
to 
make 
legislative 
progress, so often I see that we are far 
apart in terms of how we want to go 
about it. 
I came here from a State like Indi-
ana, where serving in our State legisla-
ture and running a business for 37 
years, we seemed to get things done. 
Even though we were divided, of 
course, like most legislative bodies are, 
we came together and did things that 
made a difference for our constituents. 
In the time before the impeachment 
saga came along, COVID, and civil un-
rest, I thought many of us were putting 
our shoulders to the grindstone—and I 
am on committees like Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions—wanting 
to weigh in on talking about some of 
things the Democrats have brought up 
about healthcare. And, to me, again, I 
think it brings in front of us dif-
ferences in approach, certainly. 
I am a believer that rather than try-
ing to get government even more in-
volved in certain things, that we might 
look at what actually works in the real 
world and works in many States, in-
cluding healthcare, which I agree is 
probably the No. 1 issue we face in the 
country. It was the No. 1 issue when I 
was running a business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6426 
October 24, 2020 
I think there is so much com-
monality, in the sense that we have a 
broken healthcare system. We some-
times, as conservatives, are slow to 
maneuver and may not be interested in 
doing things that need to be done, but 
I think there is a time and a place for 
that. I was pleased to see, I think, that 
70 or 80 Senators weighed in on trying 
to fix healthcare. But what interrupted 
that progress was several months of an 
impeachment saga that proved to go 
nowhere, and then we have been con-
fronted with the biggest health crisis, 
certainly, in a century—other issues. 
But, in this case, I think, to me, try-
ing to cut to the chase, this is clearly 
a sequence of maneuvers that is trying 
to interject in a process of getting one 
of the most qualified judges across the 
finish line to become a Supreme Court 
Justice. 
I think the American people are 
watching, too. They see what goes on 
here. They see that, year after year, we 
seem not to deliver results. When it 
comes to stuff that should be simple— 
when it is clear, based upon the creden-
tials, especially, of someone like Amy 
Coney Barrett, who comes from my 
State, who has done such an out-
standing job as an appellate judge, has 
impeccable credentials, and to where 
now this is being litigated not on the 
merits of who she is and how she will 
handle herself as a Supreme Court Jus-
tice—it has gotten so partisan. I think 
that really does turn people off. 
I think this is more a sequence that 
maybe we are both guilty of, to where 
we do not roll up our sleeves and get to 
the heart of the matter. I was happy to 
be the first Republican to come across 
and acknowledge that climate is an 
issue. I formed the Climate Caucus and 
got six other Republicans to do it. I 
think we have to be engaged in the key 
issues of the day. Again, as I said ear-
lier, we sometimes are slow to come to 
the discussion, but in the time that I 
am going to spend here, I would hope 
that we do legislation in the time that 
is there to do it and not try to interject 
it into a process like this. 
I am so happy that we have this in a 
situation where we are going to get her 
voted in on Monday, and, in the mean-
time, I think that any of the attempts 
that are made by the other side to be-
labor the point just shows the Amer-
ican public what is wrong with this in-
stitution. 
So, that being said, I do think that 
she is a qualified nominee to the Su-
preme Court. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that we do not belabor the proc-
ess, and I object to proceeding to legis-
lative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will 
say to the Senator from Indiana, I rec-
ognize that he is new to this body, and 
what he has seen in the Senate is not 
the Senate that I was elected to. 
There was a time—the Senator may 
find it hard to believe—when we actu-
ally brought bills to the floor. We al-
lowed amendments. Before that, of 
course, the committee had done its 
work. We allowed amendments on the 
floor up or down, and we ended up de-
liberating and voting on measures. If 
they passed here, we then had a con-
ference, and, miraculously, at some 
point, they became law. That has not 
happened here for a long, long time, 
and I don’t think you have seen it. 
Maybe the Defense authorization bill is 
as close as it gets, though we don’t 
have active amendments there. 
In this circumstance, on this bill 
which I brought before the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee 18 years ago—18 
years ago—it has passed the House of 
Representatives and is sitting on Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s desk for a year. It 
has been referred to the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, and I cochair the Im-
migration Subcommittee with your 
colleague, who is standing to your 
right, from Texas. We have met once in 
the last 2 years—once—and have never 
taken this up. So for the sake of the 
people affected by it, asking that it 
come to the floor is not an unreason-
able request. Their lives are tied up in 
it. 
So I would love to see regular order. 
We haven’t seen it in so long. Most peo-
ple wouldn’t recognize it. But I under-
stand your objection. 
I have a series, but I am only going 
to make one more unanimous consent 
request because I see Members waiting 
to speak. This one is very relevant and 
very timely. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 4617 
Mr. President, we know that foreign 
election interference continues to be a 
real threat in America. Just this week 
we learned of a foreign influence cam-
paign carried out by Iran in which 
fake, menacing emails were sent to 
Democratic voters who were told to 
vote for Trump or ‘‘we will come after 
you.’’ The origin, we are told by intel-
ligence agencies, is Iran. 
FBI Director Wray has said that Rus-
sia has been ‘‘very active in its efforts 
to influence the election’’ and seeks to 
‘‘denigrate Democratic nominee Joe 
Biden’’—two countries up to their el-
bows in trying to make a mess of our 
election campaign. 
It is well past time to address this 
threat. We spend a time of lot talking 
about it. We could do it today by pass-
ing the House-passed SHIELD Act. 
This is a bill passed in the House of 
Representatives that would establish a 
duty to report election interference 
from foreign entities so the FBI and 
the Federal Election Commission are 
aware when foreign powers are offering 
unlawful—unlawful—election 
assist-
ance to campaigns and other political 
committees. 
This bill would restrict the exchange 
of campaign information with foreign 
entities by making it illegal to offer 
nonpublic campaign material to for-
eign governments and those linked 
with foreign governments. 
The bill would improve transparency 
by applying existing campaign adver-
tising requirements to online adver-
tisements, and it would close critical 
loopholes in the law to further limit 
political spending by foreign nationals 
and foreign governments to try to in-
fluence the outcome of a U.S. election. 
Finally, the bill would prohibit de-
ceptive practices about voting proce-
dures to stop individuals from pro-
viding false information about voting 
rules and qualifications for voting. 
In light of these ongoing threats to 
both Presidential candidates, President 
Trump as well as Vice President 
Biden—this is a bipartisan attack. 
They are not just going after Demo-
crats or Republicans; they are going 
after all of us. Isn’t it about time we 
said that we are fed up with it, and it 
has to stop? That is all this bill does. It 
is bipartisan. 
In order to proceed to the consider-
ation of this bill in time for it to affect 
the outcome of this election, perhaps, 
H.R. 4617, the SHIELD Act, I ask that 
we proceed to consideration of it to 
prevent foreign interference in elec-
tions. I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to legislative ses-
sion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right object, as I said earlier, the 
Senate is currently considering the 
nomination of a highly qualified nomi-
nee to be an Associate of the Supreme 
Court. This request is another proce-
dural move just to belabor the process. 
They voted to adjourn until after the 
election four times this week, so, obvi-
ously, this bill, even though it may 
have merits that we need to discuss, 
should not be done in this format. 
Continuing to consider this highly 
qualified nominee to the Supreme 
Court is the utmost, most important 
thing that we should do here. There-
fore, I object to proceeding to legisla-
tive session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 4995, H.R. 
4996, AND H.R. 1585 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, H.R. 4995 
is one that passed the House from Rep-
resentative ENGEL to help address ma-
ternal health gaps and disparities in 
rural communities. The bill would pro-
vide grants at HHS to networks of 
healthcare 
providers 
and 
academic 
partners to expand obstetric capacity 
and improve trainings in underserved 
rural areas. 
The trainings would help to address 
implicit bias, which—more so than eco-
nomic status, health status, or edu-
cation level—can contribute to health 
negative outcomes for moms and their 
babies. 
Due to lack of specialists and geo-
graphic gaps, maternal health out-
comes in rural Illinois are worse than 
in urban areas. So when it comes to re-
sponding to and tackling the urgent 
health 
challenges 
of 
the 
moment,

alongside 
addressing 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, these bills can help close the 
disparities and gaps that exist in 
health care in America. 
H.R. 4996, sponsored by Congress-
woman ROBIN
KELLY
from Illinois, 
passed the House in September. It 
closely mirrors a provision in legisla-
tion I have introduced in the Senate, 
the MOMMA Act. This critical legisla-
tion addresses our Nation’s uncon-
scionable disparities in maternal and 
infant mortality by ensuring mothers 
can maintain access to care and pre-
vent pregnancy-related complications. 
The U.S. is 1 of only 13 countries in 
the world where the maternal mor-
tality rate is worse now than it was 25 
years ago. Nationwide more than 700 
women die every year as a result of 
their pregnancy, and more than 70,000 
others suffer severe, near-fatal com-
plications. Across the country, women 
of color are four times more likely to 
die from pregnancy-related complica-
tions than white women. The COVID–19 
pandemic has magnified these racial 
and ethnic health disparities that al-
ready existed. These gaps in our health 
system are unacceptable. 
Medicaid covers half of the births in 
Illinois. This policy would help thou-
sands of mothers in Illinois and nation-
wide by enabling Medicaid to provide 
coverage for low-income mothers for 
up to 1 year, compared to the current 
limit of 60 days. It is time we turn the 
page on this unacceptable inequity in 
our healthcare system and address a 
real need across America. 
H.R. 
1585, 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act was signed into law 26 
years ago, and it must be reauthorized. 
This law has been a lifeline for sur-
vivors of domestic violence and sexual 
assault in my State of Illinois and 
across the country. Over a year ago, 
the House voted to reauthorize and 
strengthen VAWA. But the Republican- 
controlled Senate has refused to bring 
this bill to the floor for a vote. 
For many Americans, home is not al-
ways a safe place, and the COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
presented 
particular 
challenges for people facing abusive 
situations and domestic violence. It is 
shameful that Leader MCCONNELL has 
refused to call this critical reauthor-
ization to the Senate floor for a vote. 
It is long past time for the Senate to 
renew and strengthen VAWA. 
In order to proceed to the consider-
ation H.R. 4995, the Maternal Health 
Quality Improvement Act of 2020; H.R. 
4996, the Helping MOMS Act of 2020; 
and H.R. 1585, the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I object 
to proceeding to everything en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on 
Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee advanced the nomination of 
Judge 
Amy 
Coney 
Barrett 
unani-
mously. It was unanimous because our 
Democratic colleagues sought to boy-
cott the meeting. But what they basi-
cally did was expedite consideration of 
her nomination. 
It was really kind of puzzling to see 
the chairs that were set aside for our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
filled 
with 
large, blown-up pictures, and I will sort 
of get to that in a moment, the false 
narrative that we have seen here be-
cause our colleagues cannot success-
fully attack the character or the quali-
fications of this incredible nominee to 
this seat on the Supreme Court. 
Judge Barrett discussed everything 
from the separation of powers to the 
free expression clause of the First 
Amendment. Many of us marveled at 
her knowledge and her ability to recall 
facts and legal decisions without so 
much as even a note in front of her. 
It is no surprise that the American 
Bar Association, which the minority 
leader has called the gold standard, 
gave her their highest rating. 
The chair of the Standing Committee 
on the Judiciary said: ‘‘[I]n interviews 
with individuals in the legal profession 
and community who know Judge Bar-
rett, whether for a few years or dec-
ades, not one person uttered a negative 
word about her character.’’ 
That assessment is in line with the 
glowing letters of support we have seen 
from her former colleagues and stu-
dents whose political philosophies and 
beliefs fall across the entire political 
spectrum. 
What we have repeatedly heard is 
about Judge Barrett’s brilliance, her 
strong character, her great tempera-
ment, and her impressive humility. 
Judge Barrett, I am convinced, will 
serve our Nation well in the Supreme 
Court. 
It is clear that the mountains of evi-
dence stand in sharp contrast to the 
portrait our colleagues across the aisle 
have attempted to paint of this nomi-
nee. Democrats have tried to claim 
that she is somehow ‘‘too radical,’’ de-
spite the fact that in her 3 years on the 
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, she 
has agreed with her colleagues 95 per-
cent of the time in the 600 cases they 
have decided. 
Back in 2017, when she was nomi-
nated to the Seventh Circuit, she was 
attacked explicitly because of her 
Catholic faith, even though our col-
leagues know that under the Constitu-
tion, no religious test is permissible, 
really suggesting that because of her 
faith, she couldn’t follow her oath to 
decide cases on the facts and the law 
that come before her—truly insulting 
and completely out of character with 
the person we saw in Judge Barrett in 
front of the Judiciary Committee. 
Our colleagues even went so far as to 
hold up a chart with more than 100 
cases listed and claimed that Judge 
Barrett would overturn every single 
one of those precedents. There is cer-
tainly no evidence of that. Nothing in 
the record would suggest it. With her 
fidelity to the law, do you think she 
would be so reckless? Well, of course 
not. There is just no evidence to sup-
port it. 
But we know that because they 
couldn’t attack her on the merits, they 
decided to use fearmongering instead. 
Through 
innuendo, 
misinformation, 
and 
intellectually 
dishonest 
argu-
ments, they have been trying to stoke 
fears about how she may rule on a case 
she has not even heard yet. This is sort 
of a sky-is-falling argument, a Chicken 
Little argument. 
It really has more to do with the way 
our Democratic colleagues view the ju-
dicial branch. They view it as another 
political branch, as opposed to an apo-
litical branch that is supposed to inter-
pret the law and the facts and decide 
cases on their own merits. 
Instead of addressing her judicial phi-
losophy, our Democratic colleagues ea-
gerly shared their plan, should she be 
confirmed, to pack the Supreme Court 
with additional Justices to give them 
the 
political 
results 
they 
cannot 
achieve with the current composition 
of the Court. 
This is something that Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg explicitly condemned, saying 
that this would turn the Supreme 
Court into just another political body. 
You can imagine if Democrats, when 
they are in power, decide to add addi-
tional judges who may decide cases in 
the way they would like to see them 
decided, the temptation would be great 
for the other side of the aisle to add 
judges to the Supreme Court. It would 
completely destroy what has been 
rightly called the crown jewels of our 
Constitution, and that is our inde-
pendent judiciary. 
For many Americans, the idea of mu-
tating our only apolitical branch of 
government is absolutely terrifying. 
So, not surprisingly, our colleagues 
across the aisle have tried to rebrand 
and call this rebalancing the Court. 
Back home, this is what we call put-
ting lipstick on a pig. 
Using words like ‘‘rebalance’’ is a 
way to obscure, really, what their goal 
is. They want to seize what they view 
as an unaccountable body and use it to 
secure wins they can’t win in the rough 
and tumble of the legislative process. If 
you can’t win an election, if you can’t 
win a vote in Congress, well, get the 
Supreme Court, get the judiciary to 
bail you out. That is not the appro-
priate role of judges or the judiciary 
under our Constitution. 
Our Democratic colleagues seem ab-
solutely fearful about judges who will 
actually apply the law as written. They 
want somebody to impose a result that 
they wish were required. 
They want judges to evaluate cases 
not by the letter of the law but 
through the same lens of personal and 
political biases. In short, they don’t 
really want a fair and impartial judge

like Judge Barrett. They want a guar-
anteed result. 
Our Democratic colleagues repeat-
edly pushed Judge Barrett to say how 
she would rule on future cases. They 
asked her to share her personal views 
on 
controversial 
issues. 
They 
de-
manded a commitment from her to 
recuse herself from specific cases. But, 
once again, Judge Barrett proved why 
she is the right person for this job. She 
followed the precedent set by former 
and current Justices and respectfully 
refrained from answering those sorts of 
provocative questions. 
Contrary to what our Democratic 
colleagues believe, Supreme Court Jus-
tices are not life-tenured superlegisla-
tors. They are obligated to apply the 
law as written—no favors, no biases, no 
predetermined outcomes. That is what 
Judge Ginsburg said when she was con-
firmed, and that is why it is so impor-
tant to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. 
She has artfully demonstrated her 
understanding of the role of the judici-
ary and shown she has the tempera-
ment, the intellect, and the experience 
to serve on the Nation’s highest Court. 
She won’t impose her personal be-
liefs. She said that time and again. And 
to suggest that she would somehow 
violate her judicial oath in a future 
case is inconsistent with everything we 
have come to know about Amy Coney 
Barrett. 
She won’t impose her personal be-
liefs. She won’t try to favor one side or 
the other, and she won’t legislate from 
the bench. That is exactly the kind of 
nominee that Republicans and Demo-
crats should want on the High Court. 
So I look forward to supporting 
Judge Barrett’s nomination on Mon-
day, when we finally vote to confirm 
her. 
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
Mr. President, briefly, on another 
matter, in Thursday’s Presidential de-
bate, former Vice President Joe Biden 
said he wants to transition the United 
States from the oil industry. Actually, 
Governor Abbott appropriately said: 
No, Joe Biden wants to transition hun-
dreds of thousands of Texans from 
their paychecks. 
What Joe Biden is sending is a not 
too subtly coded message that he 
wants to end our energy industry as we 
know it. This is an industry that, ac-
cording to one study, directly or indi-
rectly supports one out of every six 
jobs in my State and is a pillar of our 
State’s economy. 
Through tax revenue, high-paying 
jobs, and downstream economic gains, 
communities across Texas reap sub-
stantial benefits from our thriving oil 
and gas industry every day, and those 
benefits reach beyond our borders or 
the borders of any other energy-pro-
ducing State. 
That is because of the hard-working 
men and women on rigs, in fields, and 
in refineries. Because of their work, 
the American people have access to re-
liable and affordable energy. 
In places like California and New 
York, folks can’t turn on their lights, 
fill up their gas tanks, or hop on an 
airplane without ever thinking about 
the men and women who made that 
seemingly simple task possible. 
Now we are seeing our Democratic 
colleagues fighting to leave these en-
ergy sources in the dust. They are talk-
ing about switching to renewables, as if 
it were as simple as turning on a light 
switch. 
In Texas, we literally believe in an 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy policy. We 
produce more electricity from wind en-
ergy, from wind turbines, than any 
other State in the Nation. But we know 
what the reality of the kind of transi-
tion that Vice President Biden has 
talked about would mean. We got a 
taste of how disastrous it would be ear-
lier this year. 
When the coronavirus pandemic hit, 
the need for Texas’s greatest natural 
resource plummeted. With fewer cars 
on the road and fewer planes in the 
sky, oil and gas producers were left 
with a lot of supply and not much de-
mand, and that is when the layoffs 
began. 
A new report by Deloitte found that, 
between March and August of this 
year, about 107,000 energy workers were 
laid off, and that doesn’t include the 
countless workers who had their pay 
cut or who were temporarily fur-
loughed. 
To make matters worse, the study 
found that as many as 70 percent of 
those jobs might not even come back 
by the end of 2021, and that is if we con-
tinue business as usual. 
If the Vice President’s plan to de-
stroy our energy industry were en-
acted, these workers would have no 
jobs to come back to, and it would be 
only the beginning of the cascading 
negative economic consequences. 
Many Americans aren’t old enough to 
remember 
the 
1970s 
energy 
crisis, 
which put our energy dependence in 
this country in the spotlight. The situ-
ation was so bad that gas stations were 
serving 
customers 
by 
appointment 
only. Some States banned neon signs 
to cut down on energy use. A number of 
towns asked their citizens not to even 
put up Christmas lights. 
It was a cold, hard dose of reality 
that brought America’s energy depend-
ence to light and underscored the need 
to increase our domestic resources and 
wean ourselves off of the dependency 
on foreign oil. And that is exactly what 
we did. We placed a ban on the export 
of crude oil at that time to grow our 
reserves here at home. 
With the shale revolution and tech-
nological advancements in the energy 
sector, in recent years, though, produc-
tion has skyrocketed. Then it became 
abundantly clear it was time to lift the 
export ban, which we did. 
Almost 5 years ago, I voted here in 
the Senate to lift that 40-year-old ex-
port ban, and until COVID–19 hit, we 
were seeing major gains. Last Novem-
ber, for the first time on record, the 
United States exported more crude oil 
and fuel than we imported. 
Now that we have reached, really, 
what you could call energy self-suffi-
ciency, our Democratic colleagues are 
eager to impose policies that would 
send us right back to the 1970s and that 
Orwellian energy crisis and wreak eco-
nomic havoc in the process. 
Really, I think Vice President Biden 
has succeeded in alienating all sides on 
this topic because he has been flipping 
and flopping back and forth about 
fracking bans, whether it would apply 
across the board or just to Federal 
lands. But KAMALA HARRIS, his running 
mate, has been abundantly clear and 
completely consistent. She said last 
year: ‘‘There’s no question I am in 
favor of banning fracking.’’ 
But whether Democrats are talking 
about a transition, a fracking ban, or 
the Green New Deal, these proposals 
will kill the goose that laid the golden 
egg—our oil and gas industry—and 
send the economy into a tailspin. They 
would bankrupt my State, with the 
best economy in the country. 
A study by the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce estimates that a fracking ban 
would cost our State nearly 3.2 million 
jobs by 2025. The annual cost of living 
would go up more than $7,000. Unem-
ployment would skyrocket, tax rev-
enue 
would 
plummet, 
and 
the 
prepandemic economy that made us 
the envy of the world might never re-
cover. 
The only thing this so-called transi-
tion would lead to is a dire economic 
picture for Texas—and I believe the 
rest 
of 
the 
country 
as 
well—and 
unaffordable or unreliable energy re-
sources. 
I want to be clear; I support efforts 
to drive down emissions. That is why 
this shale gas revolution has been so 
good for the environment, by reducing 
emissions dramatically. 
The U.S. energy-related emissions 
dropped by almost 3 percent last year, 
largely due to the increased use of nat-
ural gas for power generation. 
I also support renewable energy. As I 
said, Texas is the No. 1 producer of 
electricity from wind. But even the 
strongest 
supporters 
of 
renewable 
sources of energy can tell you right 
now renewables are not capable of pro-
viding the energy that our Nation 
needs. As we all know, the Sun does 
not always shine, and the wind does 
not always blow. So wind turbines and 
solar panels can’t fill the need, particu-
larly with about 270-plus million cars 
on the road and an airline industry— 
not to mention our national defense— 
that depends on fossil fuels to run their 
engines. 
Last year, renewables accounted for 
only 17.5 percent of our total elec-
tricity generation. For comparison, 
natural gas alone accounts for more 
than double that. While the develop-
ment 
and 
expansion 
of 
renewable 
sources is important and something 
that I support, we simply can’t cut our 
nose off to spite our face by denying 
ourselves access to, really, what is a 
gift, which is our natural resources and 
fossil fuels.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6429 
October 24, 2020 
Right now, we have hope that, once 
daily commutes and nonessential trav-
el resume, more Texas energy workers 
will be back on the job and our econ-
omy will rebound. But if our country 
were to implement the policies advo-
cated by leading Democrats, particu-
larly their Presidential and Vice Presi-
dential nominee, that hope would alto-
gether disappear. 
This is not the time, if ever there was 
a time, to implement heavy-handed, 
short-sighted government policies like 
that. Our energy industry is still reel-
ing from the impact of the coronavirus, 
and our Democratic colleagues’ disas-
trous policies would not make that bet-
ter; it would make it worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
am glad I was here to hear the wise 
words of the Senator from Texas. I 
look at our region, in the Tennessee 
Valley, compared to California. Cali-
fornia is moving ahead with a policy a 
lot like Vice President Biden’s. They 
have got a high goal for powering that 
whole State on wind and solar and clos-
ing their nuclear plants. 
What is happening in California? 
Rates are going through the roof, and 
they are having rolling blackouts. 
What is happening in Tennessee and 
the Tennessee Valley? The TVA has 
very wisely expanded nuclear power so 
that it is more than 40 percent of our 
electricity. 
Of course, nuclear power is totally 
emission-free—no carbon, zero carbon— 
it is reliable, and it is, by far, most of 
the carbon-free electricity we produce 
in this country. The combination of 
that nuclear power, hydropower, and 
natural gas in Tennessee has given us 
one of the cleanest areas. In the East 
Tennessee area where I live, I can see 
the mountains clearly now because pol-
lution control is on all the coal plants. 
So we need a realistic energy policy, 
not a fanciful one. We don’t want roll-
ing blackouts throughout the country 
like California has because they have 
adopted exactly the policy that Vice 
President Biden is advocating. 
VACCINE SAFETY 
Mr. President, I come to the floor to 
speak on another subject. I want to 
talk about science and vaccines. 
The Governors of New York and Cali-
fornia have announced they are cre-
ating their own State review panels to 
review COVID–19 vaccine data as it be-
comes available. New York Gov. An-
drew Cuomo said: ‘‘Frankly, I’m not 
going to trust the Federal Govern-
ment’s opinion.’’ 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom 
has Stated the vaccine won’t be dis-
tributed in California until it is re-
viewed by a State panel of experts. The 
Governor of California said on October 
20: ‘‘Of course, we won’t take anyone’s 
word for it.’’ 
Every day, Americans take the word 
of Food and Drug Administration’s ca-
reer scientists on the safety and effec-
tiveness of the prescriptions they ap-
prove when we purchase 3.8 billion pre-
scriptions a year. Let me say that 
again. We take the word of the FDA ca-
reer scientists every day when we pur-
chase 3.8 billion prescriptions each 
year. 
I asked Dr. Stephen Hahn, the FDA 
Commissioner, on September 23, about 
the safety of a potential COVID–19 vac-
cine. He was testifying on COVID–19 in 
front of the Health Committee, which I 
chair and of which the Senator from 
Indiana is a valued member. I asked 
him: 
Dr. Hahn, who makes decisions about safe-
ty and efficacy at the FDA? Do you do it? Do 
career scientists do it? Or does the White 
House do it? 
Dr. Hahn replied: 
Career scientists at the FDA do it. That’s 
very clear. I’m briefed on all major medical 
product decisions. Overruling a center’s deci-
sion is a very rare event. I have expressed on 
multiple occasions my intention, and have 
done so during this COVID–19 pandemic, to 
make sure that those decisions are made by 
career scientists in the centers. 
I followed up by asking Dr. Hahn’s 
confidence in taking a COVID–19 vac-
cine himself. I said: 
You referred to this, but once FDA ap-
proves a vaccine, and as we’ve said today, 
we’re going to have tens of millions of doses 
ready, none can be distributed until FDA ap-
proves it. Will you be willing to take that 
vaccine for you and for your family? 
He replied: 
Absolutely. Yes. Mr. Chairman, I have 
complete and absolute faith in the expertise 
of the scientists who are terrific at FDA. If 
they were to make a determination that a 
vaccine would be safe and effective, I would 
do that. And I would encourage my family to 
take the vaccine. 
Those are the words of the man 
whose job it is to finally approve any 
COVID–19 vaccine. 
But then, at the beginning of this 
month, as FDA was preparing to issue 
additional guidance on the data needed 
from 
vaccine 
developers 
to 
dem-
onstrate safety and efficacy for an 
emergency use authorization, there 
were serious questions about whether 
the White House was politicizing the 
FDA’s approval of vaccines for COVID– 
19. 
The FDA had submitted its guidance. 
That guidance was written by career 
scientists. Those scientists had decades 
of experience, and what they wrote 
were the standards that were going to 
be used for the approval of vaccines 
against COVID–19. 
Then news reports of White House in-
terference came out which suggested 
the White House was going to change 
the FDA guidance or that the White 
House was not going to allow the FDA 
to release its own guidance. Many were 
concerned about that, including me. 
The New York Times, on October 5, 
had a big headline: ‘‘White House 
Blocks 
New 
Coronavirus 
Vaccine 
Guidelines.’’ And it went on to say, 
‘‘The F.D.A. proposed stricter guide-
lines for emergency approval of a 
coronavirus vaccine, but the White 
House chief of staff objected to provi-
sions that would push approval past 
Election Day.’’ That was the New York 
Times. 
And FOX News said: ‘‘Trump admin-
istration to block FDA guidelines that 
could delay coronavirus vaccine.’’ That 
is FOX News. ‘‘The FDA proposed 
stricter guidance last month that could 
prolong the timeline for a vaccine,’’ 
FOX News said. 
There were many stories to this ef-
fect. I could barely leave my office 
without some reporter asking me if I 
was concerned about this, about the 
politicization of the vaccine review 
process. 
So I telephoned White House Chief of 
Staff Mark Meadows, and I asked him 
about it. I said to him: ‘‘Please do not 
interfere with the standards set by the 
career scientists at FDA for the ap-
proval of a COVID–19 vaccine.’’ The 
White House did exactly what I urged 
the White House to do. The White 
House respected the decisions of the ca-
reer scientists. They did not change 
one word of the standards set by the 
career scientists for the approval of 
COVID–19 vaccines. 
So I would suggest that the Gov-
ernors of New York and California do 
the same. They should show the same 
respect to the FDA career scientists 
that the White House did. Undermining 
the FDA’s gold standard of safety and 
efficacy by setting up State review 
panels could delay approval, discourage 
Americans from taking the vaccine, 
and cost lives. 
There is a reason why we Americans 
rely on the Federal Government’s Food 
and Drug Administration for the safety 
and efficacy of vaccines. In 1902, Con-
gress decided, when it passed the Bio-
logics Control Act, that the Federal 
Government should regulate vaccines 
after tragic incidents of children dying 
from contaminated diphtheria anti-
toxin and smallpox vaccines. 
This law charged the Federal labora-
tory that would later become the Na-
tional Institutes of Health in 1930 with 
ensuring the ‘‘safety, purity, and po-
tency’’ of biologic products such as 
vaccines. 
Then, in 1972, the regulation of vac-
cines moved to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, to what is now called the 
Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research. 
FDA, therefore, has had almost 50 
years of experience to refine the proc-
ess for reviewing safety and efficacy 
for vaccines, including what data to 
look at and how to design clinical 
trials to prove that the vaccines work 
and that the vaccines are safe. 
Earlier this week, the FDA convened 
independent scientific and medical ex-
perts to discuss this. They talked 
about the development, authorization, 
and approval of vaccines for COVID–19. 
This is not a new process for assessing 
vaccines. The FDA routinely convenes 
these type of independent panels to 
help inform its review. Dr. Peter 
Marks, head of the Center for Biologics

October 24, 2020 
Evaluation and Research, at FDA, 
wrote this about the vaccine advisory 
committee’s role on FDA’s website: 
The committee will hear presentations 
from experts in COVID–19 disease and vac-
cine development, as well as from career 
FDA scientists. Topics will include studies 
needed to support authorization or approval, 
post-marketing safety studies needed fol-
lowing an approval, and what would be nec-
essary for ongoing safety monitoring fol-
lowing issuance of an emergency use author-
ization for COVID–19 vaccine. 
Dr. Marks continued: 
There will also be a part of the meeting 
during which members of the public will 
have an opportunity to speak and provide 
input, and this will be followed by a thor-
ough discussion of the issues by the com-
mittee members. The members of this com-
mittee are external scientific and public 
health experts from around the country, spe-
cializing in fields such as immunology, virol-
ogy, infectious diseases, pediatrics, vaccine 
development, and vaccine safety. 
This meeting, and any other FDA ad-
visory committee meeting, can be 
viewed by the public. At the Senate 
Health Committee hearing on Sep-
tember 23, where FDA Commissioner 
Stephen Hahn testified, I reviewed the 
three steps that have to happen before 
FDA will approve a vaccine: No. 1, 
independent experts overseeing clinical 
trials 
determine 
whether 
there 
is 
enough data available for the FDA to 
review. 
No. 2, after demonstrating safety and 
efficacy based on clinical trials, the 
vaccine manufacturer submits an ap-
plication to the FDA. 
And No. 3, FDA experts conduct their 
review and make the final determina-
tion whether or not it is safe and that 
it works. 
In other words, no one knows when 
the vaccine will be ready to distribute. 
No one knows that, even Dr. Hahn. And 
why does he not know it? Because 
there is this elaborate, independent, 
public process established by career 
scientists, with not a word changed by 
the White House, that will review the 
data and then make a decision. Be-
cause of the work of Congress and the 
administration, tens of millions of 
doses are being manufactured. So when 
that approval comes—whether it is No-
vember, December, or January—there 
will be tens of millions of doses of vac-
cine ready to distribute to the Amer-
ican people. But that approval won’t 
come until the career scientists’ rules 
are followed. 
The FDA is considered the gold 
standard in the world, in part because 
it is one of the few regulatory agencies 
in the world that looks at detailed clin-
ical trial data as part of its review, 
rather than summaries of clinical trial 
data. 
The FDA Division making the deci-
sion to approve or authorize a vaccine 
for COVID–19 is led by experts with 
decades of experience, including Dr. 
Peter Marks, whom I mentioned, the 
head of the Center for Biologics Eval-
uation and Research. He has been at 
the center since 2012. Dr. Celia Witten 
has been at FDA since 1996. The Vac-
cine Division of the Center for Bio-
logics Evaluation and Research is led 
by Dr. Marion Gruber, who has over 20 
years of experience in regulatory re-
view and approval of vaccines and bio-
logics. The Deputy Director of the Vac-
cine Division, Dr. Philip Krause, has 10 
years of experience at FDA working on 
vaccines. FDA will also have the advice 
of independent advisory committees. 
California and New York—no State 
will be able to assemble a scientific 
panel of experts with the same high 
level of knowledge and experience re-
viewing safety and efficacy informa-
tion as exists at the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration. Democratic Governors in 
those two States should not both be 
telling President Trump that he ought 
to follow the advice of scientists like 
Dr. Fauci, which he should do, but at 
the same time undermine the review 
and the work of similar career sci-
entists at the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. 
Vaccines save lives. We have heard 
testimony in our Health Committee 
demonstrating that. Undermining pub-
lic confidence in vaccine risks not only 
our ability to combat COVID–19 but ac-
ceptance of other vaccines as well. 
If California and New York can over-
ride the FDA on vaccines, what would 
prevent Republican Governors from 
banning RU–486, the abortion drug, in 
their States? If that were to happen, I 
am sure my Democratic colleagues 
would cry politics and suggest that if 
FDA has reviewed and approved a drug 
and said it is safe and effective, then, 
States should not be able to say that it 
is unsafe. 
FDA is the right agency to review 
and approve vaccines and drugs and 
medical devices. I would urge the Gov-
ernors of California and New York not 
to set up their State review panels but 
instead focus their time and resources 
on planning to distribute the vaccine 
and improving testing and contract 
tracing, using the resources that Con-
gress has given to States, rather than 
second-guessing the efforts of sci-
entists at the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
for more than year and a half, Leader 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
have refused to take action on the 
House-passed For the People Act at a 
time when our democracy is under 
siege in so many ways. The For the 
People Act is a bold proposal that will 
restore people’s trust in our demo-
cratic system, a trust that is fading. It 
is for the people. In order to make a 
more perfect Union, it would shore up 
our elections from threats from abroad. 
That is something we have just re-
cently read more and more about. Why 
aren’t we doing more on that? 
In fact, when Senator VAN HOLLEN, a 
few days ago, put on the floor a UC of 
an act that would say Russia should 
have sanctions imposed on it if they 
interfere with our elections, the other 
side blocked it. I hope they are not fol-
lowing Donald Trump’s obeisance to 
Russia and his view that Putin is just 
OK. 
It would also dismantle systematic 
hurdles that discourage voter partici-
pation. One of the worst things the Su-
preme Court has done—and there are 
quite a few under this conservative ma-
jority—is the Shelby decision, where 
Justice Roberts, leading the charge, 
said: We can dismantle the toughest 
protections under the Voting Rights 
Act. He said: States aren’t going to dis-
criminate anymore. 
And within a year, 20 States passed 
laws making it harder to vote. That is 
despicable. That is an awful case. 
It would help beat back decades of 
loose finance rules that empowered 
special interests at the expense of the 
American people. We all know about 
the dark money that is cascading into 
our system. In fact, SHELDON WHITE-
HOUSE yesterday asked to make that 
public, to disclose those kinds of con-
tributions when it came to the Su-
preme Court, where rightwing money 
pours in to make sure that rightwing 
nominees get on the Court and move to 
pull the American agenda so much fur-
ther to the right than the American 
people ever would. 
Well, in general, there is too much 
dark money, too much special interest 
money. This would undo it. As election 
interference remains an urgent threat, 
as efforts to disenfranchise voters—es-
pecially voters of color, young voters, 
and low-income voters—persist, and as 
powerful special interests continue to 
exercise outside influence in our elec-
tions, the need for this legislation 
couldn’t be more clear. 
Unfortunately, the Republican leader 
has 
other 
priorities. 
Rather 
than 
strengthen our democracy, rather than 
protecting our right to vote, rather 
than fighting big money or tackling 
corruption, rather than addressing any 
of the myriad of problems in our de-
mocracy that this country faces, Lead-
er MCCONNELL is undoing democracy by 
rushing through a lifetime appoint-
ment to the Supreme Court mere days 
before an election. 
You couldn’t find a more different set 
of priorities from that of everyday 
Americans if you tried. I urge Leader 
MCCONNELL to stop this unprecedented 
and nakedly partisan process and in-
stead put this important legislation on 
the Senate floor for a vote now. Let’s 
discuss it. Let’s debate it. Let’s not 
just reject it at a time when we need to 
do so much of this. 
In order to proceed to the consider-
ation of H.R. 1, For the People Act, I

S6431 
October 24, 2020 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I want to go 
through just a few—and it is really 
more than a few; it is a lot—of what is 
embedded in this bill. I would call it 
the ‘‘Democratic Politician Protection 
Act.’’ Let’s listen to a few of these 
things. 
The Constitution vests primary re-
sponsibility in the States to set time, 
place, and manner of elections. States 
and localities have determined how to 
conduct elections for a long, long time. 
H.R. 1, through a top-down, Federal ap-
proach, completely reverses this long-
standing 
tradition. 
Rather 
than 
strengthening the election process, it 
paves the way for rampant, I think, 
fraud, abuse, and litigation that dimin-
ishes the value of a legitimate vote, by 
doing these rushed reforms. 
Let’s look at the 2018 midterm elec-
tions. Polling showed that 92 percent of 
voters found their experience very easy 
or somewhat easy. Why fix it if it isn’t 
broken? It imposes a DC-style election 
process on the States, requiring all 
State agencies and Federal agencies, 
including colleges and universities, to 
automatically register voters, includ-
ing those who are 16 and 17 years old. It 
preempts State registration deadlines 
and 
requires 
same-day 
registration 
without verification safeguards. It ex-
pands the number of agencies that 
must contribute voter records, even to 
those who have no experience or exper-
tise in voter enrollment, forcing States 
to accept a sworn statement as proof of 
identity, instead of photo identifica-
tion, and to record the vote as a reg-
ular ballot. It expands absentee ballot 
availability and requires States to pro-
vide prepaid postage for all mail-in bal-
lots. 
It does so many things that are dif-
ferent from what we currently have in 
a system that in most places is work-
ing fine. It does not include provisions 
that require or encourage States to re-
move inaccurate voter information. It 
reduces the integrity of voter rolls by 
restricting the State ability to main-
tain voter rolls and records that ensure 
voter identity accuracy. 
There are no penalties for anyone 
who is falsely registered. It prohibits 
States from being able to continue rou-
tine maintenance on their own voter 
lists. It also creates numerous private 
rights of action that pave the way for 
trial lawyers to sue when the results of 
an election are not to their liking. 
It makes the Federal Election Com-
mission a partisan body. It politicizes 
the FEC by changing the neutral, even-
ly divided, six-member body into a 
five-member panel. It makes a new par-
tisan FEC. It changes the latitude to 
determine and interpret the subjective 
enforcement test established by this 
bill. It, in essence, takes what is work-
ing and complicates it with a top-down 
Federal system. 
We should not be rushing into some-
thing like this that is that comprehen-
sive. We should be paying attention to 
the process of getting a bona fide judge 
across the finish line, which I think 
most of us intend to do. 
Therefore, I object to this bill and to 
moving to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Objection is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5619, H.R. 
5572, H.R. 4861, AND H.R. 4585 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
another request. 
As Americans face job loss, health 
crises, isolation, and enormous daily 
stress during the pandemic, the risk of 
suicide has tragically gone up. The 
CDC found that since the pandemic 
began, twice as many Americans report 
serious consideration of suicide. The 
rate of suicide risk is especially high 
among young Americans, minorities, 
essential workers, and caregivers. 
Unfortunately, this is hitting our 
Armed Forces, as well. The Army’s 
Chief of Staff, General McConville, 
stated that he sees a correlation be-
tween COVID and a rise in military 
suicides. My office recently received a 
note, a tragically sad note, from a vet-
erans group in Rochester, NY, about a 
veteran in their region, 50 years of age, 
unemployed, and struggling during the 
pandemic. When he stopped receiving 
the $600 unemployment assistance, he 
was unable to make his mortgage pay-
ments and, unfortunately and sadly, 
very recently committed suicide. 
I have no doubt that there are more 
American veterans out there who are 
going through the same struggle. Each 
one is a separate and heartbreaking 
tragedy. These men and women who 
risked their lives for us are taking 
their own lives. It is incumbent upon 
us to do something about it. 
Congress can implement suicide pre-
vention initiatives. We may be able to 
make a difference. The House has 
passed a number of bills to get suicide 
prevention funding and new resources 
out to communities. 
I am going to ask that we go into leg-
islative session to consider four of 
those House-passed bills. This pan-
demic has taken so many lives, and we 
sometimes forget that it is not just 
those who contracted COVID, but those 
who are pushed to unimaginable stress 
and 
devastation 
because 
of 
what 
COVID has done to our economy, our 
friends, and our way of life. The Senate 
should be passing these bills and help-
ing out those who may be hiding in the 
shadows but crying out for help. 
There are four bills. I think I will ask 
for consideration on the four of them 
en bloc; is that permitted? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is by 
consent. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to proceed 
to the consideration of H.R. 5619, Sui-
cide Prevention Act; H.R. 5572, Family 
Support Services for Addiction Act of 
2020; 
H.R. 
4861, 
Effective 
Suicide 
Screening and Assessment in the Emer-
gency Department Act of 2020; and H.R. 
4585, the Campaign to Prevent Suicide 
Act, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Reserving the right 
to object, when the COVID crisis first 
hit, this body, all of Congress, recog-
nized how serious the situation was, 
and we acted. We acted in a very bipar-
tisan fashion. We acted in a massive 
fashion, as a matter of fact. 
We understood that the American 
people, through no fault of their own— 
businesses were shutting down, people 
were unemployed—and we needed to 
provide a massive level of relief, and 
we did that in a bipartisan, almost 
unanimous fashion. 
All the needs have not been met. Re-
publicans completely understand that, 
which is why we spent the August re-
cess in daily calls, talking amongst 
ourselves, trying to focus and target 
where the relief is best directed. 
What we understood when we passed 
the more than $3 trillion of COVID re-
lief in the early parts of this pandemic 
was that our efforts were going to be 
far from perfect, but they needed relief 
and, again, we supported it. 
One of the things we were trying to 
focus on, when we are already $27 tril-
lion in debt, was recognizing the fact 
that we don’t have an unlimited credit 
card; that we had to really take the 
time and hone the next relief package. 
We did that over the August recess, 
and we came together with a very tar-
geted, very appropriate, and still a 
very expensive package, over $600 bil-
lion when you add up the plus-up for 
unemployment benefits, $300 per week, 
a level that is sufficient but not so 
high that it actually provides incentive 
for people to stay on the sidelines and 
not enter the workforce. 
In my State of Wisconsin, one of the 
biggest problems employers have is 
they simply don’t have the ability to 
track people off the sidelines when you 
have a $600 plus-up. We provided addi-
tional funding for PPP, particularly for 
small businesses that have been dev-
astated. Owners have seen their life 
savings wiped out. That additional over 
$200 plus-up in relief for small busi-
nesses would be targeted, would be ap-
propriate, and it is necessary. 
There is over $100 billion for schools, 
tens of billions of dollars for additional 
testing and vaccines, billions of dollars 
for childcare and agriculture. In total, 
on top of $3 trillion, which is 14 percent 
of our GDP—by the way, a fair amount 
of that is still unspent and unobli-
gated. We took a little bit of that 
which was unspent and unobligated and 
repurposed it for this new targeted 
package. 
Fifty-two Republican Senators voted 
for that bill twice. Rather than take 
yes for an answer, rather than saying: 
Thank you, we will support this level 
of relief for the American people, our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
just said no.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6432 
October 24, 2020 
An analogy I have been using would 
be, Mr. President, if I said: Mr. Presi-
dent, give me $200. The Presiding Offi-
cer would look at me in shock, but be-
cause he is a generous individual, he 
would say: Maybe not $200, but I will 
give you $100. But just because the Pre-
siding Officer didn’t give me the full 
$200, I would go stomping off, and I 
don’t even take the $100. That is, in ef-
fect, what the Senators on the other 
side of the aisle are doing. 
We are offering and we supported $600 
billion on top of $3 trillion in relief— 
necessary relief, needed relief for un-
employment benefits, for small busi-
nesses, for vaccines, for testing, for 
education, for childcare. It is there for 
the taking. All they have to do is say 
yes. Yet they say no because they 
would rather have an issue rather than 
result. 
Are they serious about helping the 
American public or do they just want 
to play politics? I think the answer is 
quite obvious. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The emaciated bill 
filled with poison pills that the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin talks about was 
never intended to pass. In fact, the Re-
publican majority leader waited 5 
months before doing anything while 
people were suffering. The bill does not 
contain close to what is needed. 
Basically, his analogy is incorrect. 
The analogy would be saying: You have 
a series of serious illnesses; let’s treat 
one because we don’t want to pay for 
the others—even though we were will-
ing to increase the deficit by close to $2 
trillion by giving a tax break to the 
wealthy. 
So this cry about deficit, when it 
comes to helping middle-class people, 
hurting people, unemployed people, 
people who can’t feed their kids, no, it 
is the deficit. When it comes to giving 
a big tax break to wealthy corpora-
tions and wealthy people, that is fine. 
As much as I respect my colleague 
from Wisconsin, I don’t really take his 
words very seriously. Our Republican 
friends put this emaciated bill on the 
floor at the last minute because they 
got such pressure for doing nothing. 
They know it can’t pass the House. 
They know it is totally inadequate. 
This is the greatest economic crisis 
since the Great Depression, the great-
est healthcare crisis for 100 years since 
the Spanish pandemic flu, and our col-
leagues do next to nothing in terms of 
the crisis. This is loaded with poison 
pills so they know it can’t pass. They 
know it can’t pass the House, and they 
waited 5 months. 
The American people know it. When 
they are asked: Who wants to solve 
this problem, they know that it is the 
Democrats in the Senate and House 
who want to and the Republicans have 
resisted. There is no question about it. 
The bills I just asked for are small 
bills, not very expensive, that deal 
with suicide. Of course, the answer is 
no again. It is sad and unfortunate. 
Fortunately, the American people will 
be able to have a real say, not on the 
Supreme Court Justice they are rush-
ing through but on who will be the next 
administration and who will do more. 
We will see what their answer is. 
Mr. BROWN. Will the Democratic 
leader yield? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to 
yield. 
Mr. BROWN. I hear Senator JOHNSON 
talk about employers can’t find work-
ers. There are 600,000 in my State who 
lost their unemployment insurance 
just like that at the end of July. Six 
hundred thousand people lost $600 a 
week. 
I go back to March, when we passed 
this bill that was so important it 
passed unanimously. There was one 
amendment Republicans wanted for 
this $2.5 trillion bill. It was to strip out 
unemployment insurance so that those 
workers didn’t get the $600 a week. 
What are they to live on? Six hundred 
thousand people in my State can’t find 
work, 100,000 in Wisconsin, even more 
in New York, tens of thousands in Iowa 
and Utah. What are they to do? 
We know there is going to be a wave 
of evictions and foreclosures as people 
are thrown out of their apartments and 
their homes. 
This Congress continues to—the Sen-
ate just won’t do its job. Do your job. 
If Senator MCCONNELL would do his 
job, we could do our job and get this 
economy back on track. 
Thank you. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I would add one final 
thing. The bill that the Senator from 
Wisconsin talks about was totally par-
tisan, which they know can’t pass. 
Then, when Leader MCCONNELL put it 
on the floor, he filled the tree so it 
couldn’t even be amended. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Senate will soon vote on the confirma-
tion of Judge Barrett to become Asso-
ciate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I will be voting in favor of her 
nomination, and I urge my colleagues 
to do just the same. 
As was made clear to millions of 
Americans who watched her hearing, 
Judge Barrett has the temperament, 
the modesty, and the humility that we 
should all expect in a judge. She ap-
proaches cases without bias or personal 
agenda. She made that very clear to al-
most every question asked to her by 
every member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Most importantly, Judge Barrett un-
derstands the proper role of members 
of the Judiciary and our constitutional 
system of separated powers. That is, a 
judge should interpret—not make—the 
law. Making law is, under the Constitu-
tion, the responsibility of the Congress, 
not the Supreme Court. She also made 
that very clear in almost every ques-
tion that she was asked by members of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Judge Barrett has an impressive 
command and, of course, the respect 
for the law and the Constitution. Clear-
ly, from her testimony, she respects 
precedent, and she practices judicial 
restraint. In her words: ‘‘A judge who 
approaches a case as an opportunity for 
an exercise of will has . . . betrayed 
her judicial duty.’’ 
She went on to explain to the com-
mittee her legal method, how she con-
siders statutes and the Constitution 
and how she interprets and applies the 
statutes and the Constitution. Her ju-
dicial method is rigorous and exacting 
but fair. She testified that she would 
listen to both sides in every case. She 
said: ‘‘We want judges to approach 
cases thoughtfully and with an open 
mind.’’ 
When pressed on how she might rule 
in a particular case, Judge Barrett 
promptly applied what we all know as 
the Ginsburg rule, and she did it just 
like every other recent nominee to the 
Supreme Court for the last 30 years 
when Ginsburg first told the Judiciary 
Committee that there would be no 
hints, no previews, or forecasts, and 
Judge Barrett demonstrated her inde-
pendence by often repeating the Jus-
tice Ginsburg rule. 
I specifically asked Judge Barrett if 
she had made any promises or guaran-
tees to anyone about how she might 
rule on a case. She responded this way 
to my question: 
The answer is no. . . . No one ever talked 
about any case with me. . . . I can’t make 
any pre-commitments to this body either. It 
would be inconsistent with judicial inde-
pendence. 
To quote further: 
I’m not willing to make a deal—not with 
the committee, not with the president, not 
with anyone. I am independent. 
That quote or similar words were 
spoken by Judge Barrett to almost 
every suspicious Judiciary member 
about whom she might have made some 
deal ahead of time to get on the Su-
preme Court. 
Contrary to critics’ claims about her 
being biased, Judge Barrett is even-
handed and has ruled for both plaintiffs 
and defendants in all kinds of cases. 
She believes in justice for all, in ac-
cordance with the law and the Con-
stitution, just like we would expect ev-
erybody to say who is a lifetime ap-
pointee to the Judiciary, but we don’t 
see all of them following that practice. 
She went on to tell the committee: ‘‘I 
am fully committed to equal justice 
under the law for all persons.’’ 
When asked if she will follow the law 
wherever it leads, she said: ‘‘Yes.’’ 
Then she said: ‘‘I have an agenda to 
stick to the rule of law and decide 
cases as they come.’’ Yet that wasn’t 
good enough for our Democratic col-
leagues and their leftist allies. 
However, throughout the hearings, 
the Democrats and many in the media 
deliberately 
misrepresented 
Judge 
Barrett’s views on the Affordable Care

Act. They claimed her critique of Chief 
Justice Roberts’ reasoning in the 2012 
ACA case will dictate how she will vote 
in some upcoming cases. They obvi-
ously didn’t listen to her when she had 
no preconceived notions about any case 
and had made no promises to anybody. 
The Democrats even pushed the story 
line that Judge Barrett signaled to 
President Trump that she would sup-
port invalidating the ACA if she were 
confirmed to the Supreme Court. That 
is nonsense. Judge Barrett made it 
clear that she didn’t have an agenda. 
She testified: ‘‘I have no hostility to 
the ACA.’’ 
Legal scholars critique court deci-
sions all the time even when they don’t 
disagree with the outcome. For in-
stance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, before 
her nomination, criticized the Court’s 
reasoning in Roe v. Wade, but no one 
claimed that Ginsburg didn’t support 
the outcome of Roe v. Wade. 
Judge Barrett’s critique of Roberts’ 
reasoning was shared by many legal 
commentators 
across 
the 
political 
spectrum, including by ones on the 
other side of the aisle. Even President 
Obama rejected the notion that the Af-
fordable Care Act was a tax instead of 
a penalty. The question of its being a 
tax or a penalty and the constitu-
tionality or the unconstitutionality of 
the ACA was what they were critiquing 
based on Roberts’ decision to uphold 
the constitutionality of the ACA, for it 
could be constitutional under the tax-
ing powers of the Congress. Even Rob-
erts didn’t pay any attention to that 
fact. We even had Democrats saying 
that the penalty for the individual 
mandate was a penalty and that it 
wasn’t 
a 
tax. 
Moreover, 
Judge 
Barrett’s critique of Justice Roberts’ 
reasoning dealt with an interpretation 
or a provision that is no longer in ef-
fect because we did away with the indi-
vidual mandate. 
The question before the Supreme 
Court this fall, then, will be entirely 
separate, and it is pointless to specu-
late. Yet the Democrats wasted much 
time on that type of speculation—ques-
tion after question, Democrat after 
Democrat, on that side—when they 
were questioning her. 
Senate Democrats want to portray 
Judge 
Barrett 
as 
a 
threat 
to 
healthcare. They want to distract from 
the fact that they recently filibustered 
a COVID relief bill that would have 
protected preexisting conditions. This 
all is just a Democratic election year 
scare tactic, and they are using it al-
most totally as a reason to vote 
against Judge Barrett. 
It happens, though, that the voters 
aren’t buying it, that the public is not 
buying it. A recent Politico poll shows 
a majority of Americans wants the 
Senate to confirm Judge Barrett, and a 
recent Huffington Post poll says: ‘‘Vot-
ers favor the confirmation of the Su-
preme Court nominee Amy Coney Bar-
rett by a 9-point margin.’’ 
She will be confirmed. That is what 
we are going to do on Sunday into 
Monday. Maybe our Democratic col-
leagues will finally show up for work, 
do their job, and give Judge Barrett an 
up-or-down vote on the merits because 
I think the public knows now, if it were 
listening in to the Judiciary Com-
mittee as it was voting her out, that 
the Democrats boycotted the commit-
tee’s deliberation. Let’s not forget 
that, just 4 years ago, the same Senate 
Democrats declared that the Court 
needed 
nine 
to 
function 
properly. 
Judge Barrett is that ninth. Only 4 
years later, they don’t seem to think 
so. 
Judge Barrett is a jurist of honor, of 
integrity, and of great principle. The 
Judiciary Committee received a num-
ber of letters in support of her nomina-
tion. They all praised her intellect, her 
judgment, her collegiality, and her 
kindness. We all saw that kindness as 
she testified over a 3-day period of 
time. 
Judge Barrett won’t be a politician 
on the Bench. She will make decisions 
as they should be decided—in an impar-
tial manner and in accordance with the 
law and the Constitution. I am pleased 
to vote in favor of Judge Barrett’s con-
firmation to be an Associate Justice of 
the Supreme Court, and I urge my col-
leagues to support her as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, that 
sounded really good. 
Senator GRASSLEY knows, of course, 
she was a good witness. Of course, she 
didn’t take positions. Of course, she 
said she made no promises. Of course, 
Judge Barrett said she was open-
minded. Cut through it all. I am not a 
lawyer, and I don’t serve on the Judici-
ary Committee. I don’t think Senator 
GRASSLEY is a lawyer, but I am not 
really sure. Maybe he is. I might be 
mistaken, and I apologize if he is. 
Yet we all know why she was nomi-
nated. President Trump said why she 
was nominated. President Trump has 
been very explicit in saying that he 
wants a judge who will overturn the 
Affordable Care Act and that he wants 
her there quickly because the Afford-
able Care Act hearings begin soon after 
the election. He wants a judge who will 
undermine women’s rights to make 
their own decisions about their own 
healthcare. He is putting her on be-
cause he knows she will oppose work-
ers’ rights. He is putting her on be-
cause he knows she will oppose mar-
riage equality. He also wants her on 
quickly because he said: I want her 
there when the election is contested 
after the election. 
So, of course, Senator MCCONNELL al-
ways does the bidding. Senator MCCON-
NELL comes out of his office. I assume 
he gets many of his marching orders 
from the President of the United 
States. He comes down here, and 51 
spineless Senators—and then there is 
the Senator sitting in the Presiding Of-
ficer’s chair, and I appreciate his cour-
age—do whatever the President tells 
MCCONNELL to tell them on issue after 
issue after issue. I mean, that is the 
way this place works. That is the cor-
ruption of this place. The President of 
the United States has said: I want her 
confirmed now because I want her 
there to decide the election that I am 
going to be involved in, and I want her 
there now so she can overturn the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
Of course, Judge Barrett said to the 
committee: Well, I have made no prom-
ises. I have made no commitments. I 
have not cut deals with anybody. Of 
course, she says that, but the fact is 
that this is why the President nomi-
nated her. We know that. 
As a result, in my State, I know what 
the Affordable Care Act has done for 
the last decade. There are 900,000 peo-
ple who have insurance who didn’t have 
insurance before the Affordable Care 
Act. More than 100,000 people under the 
age of 26 have been able to get health 
insurance because they have been able 
to stay on their parents’ healthcare 
plans. There are a million seniors in 
Ohio who have gotten free preventive 
care—screenings 
for 
osteoporosis, 
physicals. More than 100,000 Ohio sen-
iors have saved an average of $1,100 on 
their prescription drugs because of the 
Affordable Care Act. Maybe, most im-
portantly, 5 million Ohioans have pre-
existing conditions. This was before 
the coronavirus. Now that number is 
higher. There are 5 million Ohioans 
who have had their preexisting condi-
tions covered over the last decade. 
Why? Because of the Affordable Care 
Act, those people with preexisting con-
ditions have been protected. Insurance 
companies can’t raise their rates be-
cause of preexisting conditions, and 
they can’t cancel their insurance be-
cause of their preexisting conditions. 
Those will be gone. The protections for 
preexisting conditions will be gone if 
the Affordable Care Act is gone. Pro-
tections for people under 26—their 
staying on their parents’ plans—will be 
gone if the Affordable Care Act is over-
turned by the Supreme Court. 
Now, they couldn’t do it democrat-
ically. They couldn’t do it because the 
citizens of this country didn’t want it 
repealed. So President Trump has gone 
to the courts to legislate so they can 
overturn it. We know all of that. 
That is why the comments of my 
friend from Iowa are just disingenuous. 
He knows that. Of course, she didn’t sit 
in front of the committee and say: Yes, 
I made a deal. Of course, she didn’t sit 
in front of those on the committee and 
say: I have strong feelings about the 
Affordable Care Act and gay rights and 
women’s health. She is not going to 
say that. I am not a lawyer, but I know 
enough to know that she is not going 
to go to the committee and say that. 
We know what it is about. It is about 
repealing the Affordable Care Act. It is 
about taking rights away from LGBTQ 
citizens in this country. It is about 
taking 
rights 
away 
from 
women. 
Maybe it is also about fixing the elec-
tion. Deep down, the President and 
Senator MCCONNELL know they are not

going to win the election this year, so 
they want that ninth vote in the Court 
just in case the President brings a law-
suit. If it ends up in the Supreme 
Court, he and the Republicans will 
have appointed six of the nine Justices. 
That is the game in town. That is what 
we know is rigged. 
So many millions of Americans are 
frustrated and angry with the way the 
President has failed the country during 
this pandemic. We know we have 4 per-
cent of the world’s population but that 
22 percent of the deaths in the world 
are of Americans. It is not because we 
don’t have good doctors in Utah or in 
Wisconsin or in Ohio; it is because of 
terrible Presidential leadership. 
President 
Trump 
and 
Senator 
MCCONNELL have essentially left the 
country to fend for itself during this 
pandemic. The stock market is up, so 
Trump and MCCONNELL seem to think 
everything is fine. The stock market is 
up. What the heck? They are oblivious 
to the families staring at stacks of 
bills. They are oblivious to the small 
businesses that are watching years 
and, in some cases, often decades of 
hard work and investment—or they are 
family businesses going back many, 
many decades—evaporate in a few 
short minutes, but the stock market is 
up, so Trump and MCCONNELL seem to 
think everything is fine. 
It is the same story over and over 
again. Corporate lobbyists, their allies 
in Washington do whatever it takes to 
make sure Wall Street recovers, and 
then they say: Oh, no, we really can’t 
afford to help anyone else. 
I hear from small, family-owned busi-
nesses all the time, how they are strug-
gling. They are under incredible stress. 
They are worried about whether they 
can make rent or make payroll. They 
have waited on the phone for hours and 
couldn’t 
get 
answers 
about 
loans. 
These folks aren’t lounging in a C-suite 
corner office. They don’t have high- 
priced lawyers and accountants who 
can do all the paperwork. They don’t 
have the lobbyists who line up outside 
MITCH
MCCONNELL’s 
office 
helping 
them. They are fighting for their 
dreams. 
We know why they are struggling. 
We know why some of them still can’t 
open their doors 7 months—7 months— 
into this crisis because the President 
and this Senate have so botched this 
crisis. 
Again, 4 percent of the world’s popu-
lation, 22 percent of the world’s deaths, 
and the President said: I take no re-
sponsibility. The President said: Not 
my fault. The President said: I get a 10 
out of 10 for how I have managed this. 
President Trump has no plan, never 
has, to control the virus. He has not 
even 
tried. 
Imagine 
if 
President 
Trump, back in March, instead of lying 
to the American people—he knew how 
serious it was. He told his Wall Street 
friends, and he told that reporter from 
the Post. I can’t remember his name. 
He told them it was serious, but he 
didn’t tell the American people. He lied 
to us. 
Imagine, instead, if the President had 
worn a mask and stood up and treated 
us like adults and said to the American 
public: You know, this is really seri-
ous. This could turn from an epidemic 
into a pandemic. We have to fight 
back. I am wearing a mask. I ask every 
American to wear a mask, just like we 
ask people to wear seat belts and stop 
at stop signs. I want every American to 
wear a mask. I want people to socially 
distance so we can get this—but he 
didn’t do any of that. Of course he 
didn’t do any of that. 
And he also came up with no national 
testing, contact tracing strategy. He 
didn’t invoke the Defense Production 
Act so that we could make cotton 
swabs and gloves and masks and gowns 
and all the things we needed to do to 
stay safe. He had none of that. 
He has no guidance on how businesses 
are supposed to protect their cus-
tomers, no investment of our vast re-
sources to help them do it. 
And we see the results. We saw them 
in April and May, in June and July, in 
August, in September, and now Octo-
ber. In fact, in my State, as in many 
States, there are more coronavirus di-
agnoses every day—almost every day— 
than there were a month ago, 2 months 
ago, 6 months ago. 
Local restaurants are closed for good. 
The big chains may recover. Commu-
nities that already didn’t get a lot of 
investment—Brown and Black neigh-
borhoods, rural communities, places 
you can’t see from Trump Tower— 
those places are seeing their home-
grown businesses shut their doors and 
lay off workers. 
Black-owned businesses have closed 
at twice the rate of White-owned busi-
nesses. We know Latino- and Asian- 
owned businesses are getting dispropor-
tionately hurt. 
Our office hears from so many of 
these Ohio businesses. We have done a 
series of virtual roundtables with Ohio 
restaurants. 
One Ohioan in Zanesville talked 
about taking over the family business 
his dad first started 67 years ago. Busi-
ness is down significantly. He tries to 
pay his employees a living wage and 
give them time off for vacations and 
family needs. He is a really good em-
ployer. He is afraid of letting his em-
ployees down. 
Another, a bar owner in Belle-
fontaine, told us his sales are down and 
he is worried about his own businesses. 
When he wrote to me, he didn’t just 
talk about himself. He said that he is 
worried about the ripple effects on the 
farmers 
and 
suppliers, 
the 
truck-
drivers, and so many others. 
Now he is dreading the winter, when 
he won’t even be able to use the patio. 
He wonders what he is going to do, 
what the suppliers are going to do. 
And it is not just restaurants. The 
media reported on a newsstand in 
downtown Cleveland, owned by Mr. 
Patel, an Indian immigrant who came 
to Ohio and has lived the American 
Dream. He built a better life, started 
his own business, was employing other 
Clevelanders. Now the office building is 
empty. The food court is closed. His 
sales have dropped from $700 a day to 
just $200 a day. He is looking at impos-
sible choices unless the government 
helps. 
We know we can. We did it in the 
spring when we passed payroll protec-
tion. There were all kinds of implemen-
tation problems. The Secretary of the 
Treasury and the President seemed 
more interested in the big guys than 
the little guys. Too many businesses 
went to the front of the line, but de-
spite all that, we hear from businesses 
that are open today only because of 
PPP. 
I heard from Spangler Candy in 
Bryan, OH, a family-owned union com-
pany. I have toured their plant and 
seen the great work this, I believe, 
fourth generation management team 
has done. 
They have seen business drop 70 per-
cent. They had to take their first Fed-
eral support in their 114-year history, 
using PPP to prevent layoffs. They 
kept their doors open, and they pro-
vided pandemic premium pay for their 
Teamster employees. 
A music and arts venue in Youngs-
town, the Westside Bowl, talked at one 
roundtable about how they how had 
zero dollars in revenue in the past 6 
months. PPP kept their office staff and 
stagehands on payroll, but as it runs 
out, so will their ability to pay em-
ployees. 
Ohio Star Forge, a parts manufac-
turer in Warren, just north of Youngs-
town, represented by the Steelworkers, 
lost 90 percent of their business when 
auto plants shut down. PPP made a dif-
ference. They are now back to about 70 
percent of their capacity. 
Polter’s Berry Farm is a family farm 
in Fremont. One of their crops is pump-
kins. The major pumpkin buyers are 
amusement parks and fall festivals. 
Pumpkin sales were down. PPP was 
helpful, but now they are worried 
about whether they can repay it. 
A+ Cleaners in Dayton has seen de-
mand plummet. People don’t need 
much dry cleaning when they are 
working from home. They were able to 
stay open with an EIDL loan and a 
CARES Act grant from the county. 
They are terrified of what happens 
when the money runs out. 
We have a bill to get more help to 
these businesses—the Small Business 
Lifeline Act. It would extend PPP 
through at least next spring. It would 
get more funding to the program so 
they can get more money out the door 
to these businesses. It would specifi-
cally target help to the truly small 
businesses that need it the most, in-
cluding minority-owned businesses. It 
would extend the debt relief program. 
It would get help to nonprofits that we 
know are hurting just like businesses 
are. 
As important as these steps are, we 
can’t just give businesses loans and 
think that will take care of it when the

October 24, 2020 
virus is still raging and the customers 
don’t have jobs. 
That is why we need a comprehensive 
bill that actually meets the magnitude 
of this crisis. This visceral, decades- 
long opposition from my colleagues to 
unemployment 
insurance—I 
don’t 
know how they don’t realize that when 
600,000 Ohioans are getting $600 a week, 
they are spending that money at local 
businesses. They are keeping the econ-
omy going from just a total crevasse. 
They are helping the economy. They 
are helping local businesses. They are 
giving those businesses revenue, but 
when the $600 just stops, not only are 
those 600,000 Ohioans’ lives just so, so 
difficult, but it makes the businesses of 
which they are patrons, the businesses 
that they patronize—it obviously hurts 
them at their bottom line. 
I think the stories from these busi-
nesses really get to the fundamental 
question of what sort of country we 
want to live in. When we invest in 
small business, we invest in people and 
communities, not stock buybacks, not 
executive bonuses. 
I know that Senator MCCONNELL and 
his colleagues here always are looking 
out for the stock market, always are 
looking out for Wall Street, always 
want to hear about stock buybacks and 
executive bonuses. I know that is their 
thing. But during a pandemic, I wish it 
were less their thing. 
The stakeholders in these businesses 
are 
not 
nameless, 
faceless 
share-
holders. They are the owners’ neigh-
bors. They are family members. They 
are the people we see or used to see at 
our kids’ schools, in the grocery store, 
and at church. 
A year from now, do we want to be 
left with only the biggest companies 
that follow the Wall Street business 
model that treats workers as expend-
able? 
Ohioans know all too well what hap-
pens when you let Wall Street run 
things and you ignore Main Street. Our 
communities have watched for decades 
as factories closed and investment 
dried up and storefronts were boarded 
over in towns and cities that once were 
thriving. 
When people in those towns wake up, 
they realize the only jobs you can get 
are at a big-box chain for rock-bottom 
wages with no healthcare, no paid sick 
leave, no power over your schedule. Is 
that what we want for our future? 
We have the resources to fix this. We 
are the greatest, richest country in the 
world. Let’s rise to meet the moment. 
Let’s pass a comprehensive bill that 
gets help to our businesses, our work-
ers, and their customers. And let’s get 
the communities the support they 
need. 
Mr. President, in order to proceed to 
the consideration of H.R. 986, the Pro-
tecting Americans with Preexisting 
Conditions 
Act, 
which 
the 
House 
passed with bipartisan support, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, where do you 
begin? That was quite the statement. 
At some point in time, it just be-
comes galling to listen to the tactics— 
the scare tactics and false allegations, 
particularly from the other side that 
gave us the Affordable Care Act, an Or-
wellian-named bill if there ever were 
one. 
One of the promises made to promote 
that bill was, in the end, determined to 
be the PolitiFact Lie of the Year—I 
think in the year 2013: If you like your 
healthcare plan, you can keep your 
plan. If you like your doctor, you can 
keep your doctor. 
Millions of Americans lost their 
healthcare plans. They lost their doc-
tors. Premiums didn’t decline by $2,500 
per 
family; 
they 
actually 
sky-
rocketed—sometimes two, three, four 
times the price because of the faulty 
design of healthcare, of the Affordable 
Care Act, ObamaCare. 
Probably the greatest false allega-
tion that is just offensive—and, by the 
way, to call every Member on this side 
spineless is offensive. We have different 
views. You know, you try to respect 
the different views if you actually want 
to accomplish something. 
But one of the greatest false allega-
tions—and they go back to the well 
time and time and time and time again 
about this—is the Republicans don’t 
want to protect the coverage for people 
with preexisting conditions. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
That was an argument made back in 
2010, and the American people decided 
that we should do that. Republicans 
agreed with the American people that 
we wanted to protect everybody’s cov-
erage, covering people with preexisting 
conditions. 
We just want to do it where it doesn’t 
cost Americans an arm and a leg. The 
faulty 
architecture 
of 
ObamaCare 
caused premiums to double, triple, and 
quadruple because they actually made 
a very small slice of the American pub-
lic—5 to 7 percent of the people who 
had to buy coverage on the individual 
market, who don’t have the employer 
coverage plans that cover people with 
preexisting conditions—they made that 
small percentage of the American pub-
lic bear the full cost and brunt of cov-
ering people with preexisting condi-
tions. It was not smart. It was a faulty 
design. 
The way you fix it is, yes, you re-
quire insurance carriers to cover people 
with preexisting conditions, not deny 
them coverage, but you spread that 
cost over everybody. 
Just as I mentioned earlier to the 
Democratic leader when I objected to 
his bill, our friends on the other side of 
the aisle are far more interested in an 
issue rather than getting a result. 
How do I know this? Well, particu-
larly on this issue, covering people 
with preexisting conditions, four times 
in just the last few days and weeks, 
they have voted no, first on two COVID 
relief packages—the ones I was refer-
ring to earlier—the target package 
that does provide financial relief to the 
unemployed, to small businesses, to 
schools, to parents with childcare and 
provides funding for agriculture and 
testing and vaccines—that also in-
cluded language to protect coverage for 
people with preexisting conditions. 
Twice in the last few days or weeks, 
they have also voted no on Senator 
TILLIS’s bill that does exactly that— 
protect the insurance coverage of peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. 
Now, if they were really serious 
about protecting the coverage of people 
with 
preexisting 
conditions, 
they 
would have voted yes. But they voted 
no. 
So I could go on and on. I have jotted 
down all kinds of points that I would 
like to refute, but it is really not worth 
the time and effort. 
Again, let me emphasize that Repub-
licans agreed with the American peo-
ple. This debate is over. We have of-
fered proposals to do just this. We want 
to protect the insurance coverage of 
every American with preexisting condi-
tions. We just want to do it in a way 
that doesn’t cost them an arm and a 
leg like ObamaCare did. 
So I personally am just getting sick 
of the false allegations, and that is 
only one of them. I could drone on and 
on about the false allegations made by 
the other side against Republicans and 
conservatives, but I will focus on this: 
This is a false charge. It is canard. It is 
a scare tactic. I am begging the Amer-
ican people not to listen to it or believe 
it. Republicans want to protect the in-
surance coverage of people with pre-
existing conditions. If they were seri-
ous about it, they would have voted yes 
on what we have already proposed; and 
for that and many other reasons, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, before of-
fering another unanimous consent, I 
just point out there were 10 years of 
protections for people with preexisting 
conditions under ObamaCare and 10 
years of speeches from Republicans 
about repeal and replace, with no real 
proposal to replace the Affordable Care 
Act. The President has promised it 
about every couple of weeks through 4 
years, and he still hasn’t put a real bill 
forward. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1230 
Mr. President, in order to proceed to 
the consideration of H.R. 1230, Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act, which passed the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will 
hold the floor for just another few mo-
ments. 
I have watched Senator MCCONNELL— 
and I am sorry to call some of my col-
leagues spineless, Senator JOHNSON, 
but, you know, when the President 
made comments about our soldiers who 
had died in battle, I didn’t hear hardly 
any Republicans speak up. I admire the 
courage of the Presiding Officer. I ad-
mire Senator MURKOWSKI and her cour-
age over a number of things. But I see 
my colleagues—I hear what you all 
think. I know what Senator SASSE said 
during that townhall. I know many of 
you, if not most of you, maybe all of 
you—probably not—think that about 
the President’s lack of integrity and 
lack of character and dishonesty and 
the lies he tells. And I know, I have 
watched, and I sat right here and I 
looked across the aisle during impeach-
ment and I saw the look of fear in my 
colleagues’ eyes because they didn’t 
want to cross the President; they 
didn’t want to get the President to 
tweet about them or even get a pri-
mary opponent to them. That is why I 
use that term, but more importantly to 
the citizens of this country, we spent 
most of the last month after month 
after month after month, confirming 
very conservative, very young judges. I 
understand why you want to do that, 
but we are not doing anything for the 
public. 
We had a high moment in March 
when Senator JOHNSON said we unani-
mously approved the CARES Act. A 
study shows the CARES Act kept 12 
million Americans out of poverty. But 
then we ask to continue the CARES 
Act and do something similar like the 
Heroes 
Act, 
and 
instead 
Senator 
MCCONNELL—and I know the lobbyists 
that line up in front of his door, I know 
they have a lot of influence on him, but 
we saw Senator MCCONNELL say: no ur-
gency, no urgency. 
My favorite Abraham Lincoln quote 
is Lincoln wanted to—his staff wanted 
him to stay in the White House and 
win the war and abolish slavery and 
protect the Union, and they wanted 
him to stay in the White House. And he 
said: No, I have to go out and get my 
public opinion baths. Are none of my 
colleagues hearing the pain of laid-off 
workers who have lost their unemploy-
ment? 
Haven’t they seen schoolchildren— 
their parents saying: ‘‘I want to send 
my kids back to school, but they are 
not safe’’ because we aren’t voting dol-
lars to help? 
I talked to my daughter last night. 
Just a few days ago, they announced 
that instead of school opening in per-
son in Columbus next week, it is going 
to open in January, if even then, be-
cause we are not helping schools open. 
We are not helping people avoid evic-
tion. We are not helping local govern-
ments keep police and firemen on the 
streets and people who work in the 
parks and people who provide help for 
abused children and all the things that 
local governments do—we are doing 
none of that, but we have plenty of 
time to do judges. That is the frustra-
tion and why I made the comments I 
made. 
It just breaks my heart that we all 
sit here. This is a group of pretty afflu-
ent and pretty privileged people. Yet 
we can’t look out for people who are 
hurting like this country hasn’t hurt 
for decades. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this 
deserves a response. 
The pandemic is an act of God. 
Maybe—maybe—and we don’t know. 
We don’t know what complicity China 
had in—the chance that it was devel-
oped in a lab in this. We just don’t 
know. But we certainly know that 
China controlled the spread in China 
while they allowed their citizens to go 
all over the world and spread the pan-
demic. It is an act of God. It is cer-
tainly nobody’s fault in the United 
States. 
As chairman of Homeland Security, 
we have had before our committee the 
men and women in charge of these 
agencies who are trying to respond to 
an incredibly difficult situation. 
I never criticized President Obama or 
Vice President Biden during H1N1. It 
was a contagious disease, and 60 mil-
lion Americans were infected by it. I 
am not sure there is anything you real-
ly can do to prevent infections. 
Now, I think we have actually been 
pretty successful in flattening the 
curve, people taking responsibility, be-
coming germophobes. We shut down 
our economy. Now, I never thought we 
should shut it down to the extent that 
we have because I have always tried to 
keep things in perspective, the human 
toll of the economic devastation of 
those shutdowns. But again, I find it 
galling when I know people like Pete 
Gaynor, General Giroir—the men and 
women—Dr. Birx, Dr. Hahn, the men 
and women in this administration who 
have been working 24/7 to respond as ef-
fectively as they can to an act of God, 
a pandemic. 
Now, I have been on the conference 
calls. This administration has been as 
transparent as any I have seen. To ac-
cuse this administration of hiding the 
truth—I don’t know where you were 
during the early months of this, but I 
was watching the hour- and 2-hour-long 
press conferences where the truth was 
being laid out in all its gory detail. 
Any American who watched that that 
wasn’t concerned about COVID, I don’t 
know what they were looking at. There 
was no hiding the ball here. President 
Trump and his administration made it 
very obvious what was at stake. 
I am also aware of the fact that be-
cause of this act of God, because of this 
pandemic, there was an enormous de-
mand for products that should have 
been in the national stockpile but 
wasn’t there because the previous ad-
ministration had run the stockpile 
down, and then we, all of us collec-
tively, took our eye off the ball and 
didn’t restore it. So the product just 
wasn’t there. But I do know, in a very 
difficult situation, when demand out-
strips supply by two or three times, the 
men and women in this administration, 
again, working tirelessly, allocated 
that PPE. 
I am not aware that anybody ran out. 
Now, I know that everybody didn’t get 
everything they wanted because some 
tough decisions had to be made. We had 
to 
surge 
PPE 
product 
to 
those 
hotspots, and where the pandemic 
wasn’t raging, people didn’t get every-
thing they needed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6437 
October 24, 2020 
I am not aware of anybody who want-
ed to get placed on a ventilator who 
didn’t get one because they used the 
war production act. We did extraor-
dinary things in terms of ramping up 
production. Now we are supplying ven-
tilators to the world. 
You can overlook all these things, 
and you can say the administration 
wasn’t honest with the American pub-
lic, but I think the actual facts refute 
those charges. 
Maybe in other people’s world there 
is perfection, and in this pandemic you 
can stop it in its tracks. You can pre-
vent further infections. But that didn’t 
happen with H1N1, even though they 
tried. Sixty-million Americans got it. 
Fortunately, it was not as deadly as 
the coronavirus and COVID–19. 
Again, among many things that are 
galling, the false allegations—to me, to 
politicize a pandemic, to politicize a 
virus that is killing Americans, to 
denigrate the efforts of the men and 
women in these agencies who have 
worked 24/7 is just simply wrong. This 
is not something that should divide us; 
that we should politicize. It is some-
thing that should unite us as prior cri-
ses in this country have. So, again, 
there are so many more other things I 
can say, but I see the Senator from 
Alaska is here, and I don’t want to 
take any more time on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BROWN. One last comment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. I just don’t really un-
derstand what I just heard, when the 
President went straight to the Amer-
ican people and told them it was going 
to disappear. He said it was a Demo-
cratic, liberal hoax to bring down his 
campaign. 
But look at a little history. I wear on 
my lapel a picture of a canary in a 
birdcage. It was given to me at a work-
ers’ Memorial Day rally, a rally to 
honor workers who had been injured or 
killed on the job. 
This canary in the birdcage—you 
know, the mine workers used to take it 
down in the mines 120 years ago. If the 
canary died, the mine worker got out 
of the mine. He knew that he didn’t 
have a union that was very strong or a 
government that cared very much. He 
was on his own. So I always cared a lot 
about public health. That is really the 
best prevention for the canary in the 
mine. 
I wrote a letter to President Trump 
in 2018, after he had closed the Office of 
Global Health Security in the White 
House and essentially fired or trans-
ferred Dr. Ziemer, a Bush appointee 
who was one of the world’s great ma-
laria doctors. His job—he had 40 people 
on his staff. His job was to surveil the 
world and look at potential disease 
outbreaks that might turn into an epi-
demic which then might evolve into a 
pandemic. That was his job. The Presi-
dent eliminated the office. And I wrote 
a letter to the President asking him to 
reinstate it, and he didn’t even answer 
the letter. 
Then, the following year, 2019, he 
brought Dr. Linda Quick home from 
China. And her job was to make sure, if 
anything was happening in China, that 
we would know about it and could help 
them prevent the disease. Our CDC— 
our Centers for Disease Control, we are 
the best in the world. It was the United 
States of America leading the charge 
to eliminate smallpox. It was the 
United States of America that led the 
job to all but eliminate polio in this 
country. Some of us here are old 
enough—the Presiding Officer, anyway, 
will remember knowing people who had 
minor cases growing up in our schools. 
So we know what that meant. It was 
the President of the United States who 
pulled CDC employees out of China be-
cause of a trade or some—depending on 
when the President loved Xi or disliked 
Xi—I mean, it was back and forth with 
the Chinese leader, and we just unilat-
erally disarmed. Then the President de-
nied that the virus meant anything. 
I know he took care of ventilators, 
but other kinds of protective equip-
ment, just talk to nurses and doctors 
and healthcare workers in our States— 
in Madison, in Cleveland, in Columbus, 
in Milwaukee, in Kenosha and Fair-
banks and Salt Lake City. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
want to start with a personal thank- 
you to the Presiding Officer for indulg-
ing me for an additional few moments 
here so I may speak this afternoon on 
the nomination of Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett to be an Associate Justice of 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
And while I intend to share with you 
my intention on how I will vote, I 
would like to start by expressing my 
disappointment with where we are in 
the Senate as a whole right now. There 
has been some good discussion here 
this morning as we are considering 
these unanimous consent agreements— 
statements being made but not action 
moving forward. 
I had hoped that if we were going to 
be at this moment in time, just over a 
week out from our national elections, 
that we would be here on the floor de-
bating the merits of a COVID relief 
bill. In my home State of Alaska, as in 
so many States around the country, we 
are seeing unprecedented numbers now. 
The news, just yesterday, Friday, was 
that the United States reported the 
highest single-day recorded positive 
cases—83,757—really staggering. 
In Alaska, we have seen this virus 
spread to some of our small outlying 
villages, villages that are not acces-
sible by road and villages that have 
limited medical facilities. We are real-
ly quite concerned about what this 
means for many of the Native people in 
these areas. 
We are not able to stay on top of the 
contact tracing like we were some 
months ago because of our increasing 
numbers. The pressure on hospital ca-
pacity is also a growing concern. And, 
economically, Alaska has been hit ex-
traordinarily hard. As most know, we 
have a pretty substantial tourist sea-
son, but this year, we had little to no 
season for us. Many small businesses 
have closed permanently, but many, 
many more are going into the winter 
wondering how they are going to make 
it through the winter and scrambling 
to find ways to piece it together. 
Unemployment, loss of housing—in 
every conversation that I have with 
Alaskans, they are asking if and when 
we are going to see another round of 
COVID relief, and I regret that we have 
no deal to offer them today. Instead, 
we are here on a weekend, 10 days be-
fore the elections, to advance a U.S. 
Supreme Court nominee. 
Now, I was here on the floor yester-
day. I had an opportunity to listen to 
the majority leader as he outlined the 
escalation of confirmation battles over 
the past 30-plus years, and I think it 
was an important lesson in our Senate 
history. I am not confused about how 
we wound up here, but I certainly am 
frustrated by it. It is with a heavy 
heart that I just regret that we are in 
this place. 
I think there was a worthy attempt 
during the 109th Congress, by the Gang 
of 14, to reduce tensions. There was, I 
think, a very genuine, good-faith effort 
there to try to dial things back. But, 
sadly, their bipartisan action was not 
rewarded by the voters, and perhaps 
that served as a warning to other Mem-
bers of this body rather than an aspira-
tion. 
We heard the history lesson, and I am 
one who has long recognized that 
pointing fingers doesn’t ever actually 
solve a problem. I personally believe 
that every nominee for the Supreme 
Court should receive an up-or-down 
vote after they have passed out of com-
mittee. My record has been pretty 
clear, pretty consistent, and some 
might even suggest boring in its con-
sistency, but I made a very strong com-
mitment after I returned to the Senate 
at the end of 2010 and said: I do not be-
lieve that filibustering our judges was 
what we should be doing. 
So I might not have liked the judges 
that were before us, but I did not par-
ticipate in a filibuster of a judge. I had 
an opportunity to vote up or down, and 
I thought that was the reasonable way 
to proceed. I believe that it is fair to 
the individual and it is fair to the in-
stitution. 
But I also recognize that the timing 
of this confirmation that we have be-
fore us will serve to reinforce the pub-
lic perception about political influence 
on the Court, and I would hope that we 
all recognize that public confidence in 
our courts must be an imperative. We 
have to believe that justice is going to 
be equal for all of us. 
Now, I know that my colleagues are 
not surprised to hear me discuss my 
concern about the politicization of the 
Court. I made a similar point during 
the impeachment trial, when some

October 24, 2020 
wanted to literally tear down Chief 
Justice Roberts and the Court because 
they needed a sound bite for a political 
ad in the primary campaign. I made 
the same case when I voted against the 
nomination of now-Justice Kavanaugh. 
Also, during that impeachment trial, 
I implored the Members of this Cham-
ber to look inward and to really evalu-
ate: Are we really willing to tear down 
not only the other party but the other 
institutions of our government as well? 
So I have looked inward, considering, 
in these difficult days, what I believe is 
best for the institutions of our govern-
ment, and I recognize that confirming 
this nominee is not going to heal and it 
is not going to salve the wounds that 
these institutions have endured, but 
neither will threats that, should the 
balance of power in this Chamber 
change, everything is on the table, in-
cluding the end of the legislative fili-
buster and packing the Court. To do 
that would only inflict even deeper, 
deeper wounds, fundamentally and dra-
matically altering how the levers of 
power operate in this country and com-
promising the one branch of govern-
ment that must remain apolitical. 
We are the legislative branch, the ex-
ecutive branch. Both of these branches 
are inherently political. It is the third 
branch, our courts, that we count on to 
be apolitical. I think it would be a 
giant leap further down a path that we 
should not be following in the first 
place. So we have to figure out how we 
deescalate. 
So let me very simply explain this 
afternoon how I plan to vote over the 
next two days, starting with proce-
dural motions, which I opposed yester-
day, and I will oppose again tomorrow. 
In 2016, after the unfortunate death 
of Justice Scalia, I said that the Sen-
ate should not take up a nominee to 
fill that seat due to the impending 
Presidential election. I reiterated that 
statement in August of this year. And 
then, coincidentally enough, just hours 
before the news of Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing that saddened the country—I 
didn’t know that she had passed when I 
reaffirmed my comments from earlier, 
but that knowledge would not have 
changed my mind. I remain in the same 
place today. I do not believe that mov-
ing forward on a nominee just over a 
week removed from a pitched Presi-
dential election, when partisan ten-
sions are running about as high as they 
could—I don’t think that this will help 
our country become a better version of 
itself. 
But, frankly, I have lost that proce-
dural fight. We saw that with the vote 
yesterday. So what I can do now is be 
consistent with the precedent that I 
have set for myself and oppose a proc-
ess that I said should not move for-
ward, and I have done that. 
But at the end of the process is the 
substantive question of whether Judge 
Barrett should be categorically re-
jected as an Associate Justice in order 
to underscore my procedural objection. 
I believe that the only way to put us 
back on the path of appropriate consid-
eration of judicial nominees is to 
evaluate Judge Barrett as we would 
want to be judged—on the merits of her 
qualifications. And we do that when 
that final question comes before us, 
and when it does, I will be a ‘‘yes.’’ 
I have no doubt about her intellect. I 
have no doubt about Judge Barrett’s 
judicial temperament. I have no doubt 
about her capability to do the job and 
to do it well. 
By now, most people are very famil-
iar with her qualifications. They have 
seen her resume and bio. She has been 
all over the news, but her background 
is significant. She graduated with hon-
ors from Rhodes College and with hon-
ors from Notre Dame Law School, 
clerked on the DC Court of Appeals and 
the Supreme Court, and was an excel-
lent professor for 15 years at Notre 
Dame Law School prior to being con-
firmed on the bench on the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals. I helped to 
confirm her to that seat on the Sev-
enth Circuit. 
I have followed on from that time 
when I first came to know of Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett. I have done my 
due diligence in my role of advice and 
consent. I have worked through the ar-
ticles that she has written and the 
cases that she has written. I have en-
gaged in a lengthy one-on-one with her. 
I watched both full days when she ap-
peared 
before 
the 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee. She presented herself admi-
rably under a difficult situation. We all 
know around here that confirmation 
processes are not pretty. 
I have expressed my concerns pre-
viously that good people will decide 
that the confirmation process that we 
have now is sometimes an awful proc-
ess, that I worry that they are going to 
think that it is just not worth it, not 
worth what it puts them and their fam-
ilies through, and they opt out. They 
opt to avoid government service. 
And, on this note, I will say that 
while some of the rhetoric from my 
colleagues has been overblown and un-
necessary, this process with Judge Bar-
rett is not nearly what it was in 2018 
during the confirmation of Justice 
Kavanaugh. So, ultimately, I am glad 
and I am thankful that Judge Barrett 
did not opt out. 
I have concluded that she is the sort 
of person that we want on the Supreme 
Court. Her legal writing is excellent 
and will be an asset to her as well as 
future generations of lawyers as they 
read through her opinions. Her intel-
lectual 
curiosity, 
which 
is 
dem-
onstrated by the depth and breadth of 
her academic work as a professor, will 
also serve the country well. Her tem-
perament and her very patient nature 
were on full display over the course of 
the hearing. 
I had a good and, I think, a very sub-
stantive discussion with Judge Barrett 
about some Alaska-related matters, fo-
cusing on Alaska-specific statutes, like 
ANILCA. I raised some of the public 
safety challenges that we face in my 
home State that served to undermine 
the principle of equal justice under the 
law. 
I raised the issue of voting rights and 
access to the ballot. It was important 
for me to hear and to better under-
stand her views on precedent and her 
evaluation process, specifically the 
weight that she affords reliance on de-
cisions that have been in place for dec-
ades, such as Roe v. Wade. We dis-
cussed the doctrine of severability in 
regards to the Affordable Care Act 
case. We spoke at length about my con-
cern that the Supreme Court is in-
creasingly viewed as political by the 
public and what that then does to 
erode public confidence in the impar-
tiality of our courts. We talked about 
the criteria and the evaluation that 
that Justice would undergo for pur-
poses of recusal from a matter. 
I do not believe Judge Barrett will 
take her seat on the Bench with a pre-
determined agenda or with the goal of 
putting a torch to every volume of the 
‘‘United States Reports.’’ 
Justices should come to the Court 
with an open mind, willing to be con-
vinced by the arguments presented in 
each case, to exchange thoughts with 
their colleagues, to learn new things, 
and rule as the law requires. I am con-
vinced that Judge Barrett will do just 
that. 
So while I oppose the process that 
has led us to this point, I do not hold 
it against her as an individual who has 
navigated the gauntlet with grace, 
skill, and humility. I will vote no on 
the procedural votes ahead of us but 
yes to confirm Judge Barrett when the 
question before us is her qualification 
to be an Associate Justice on the Su-
preme Court. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to offer my support for con-
firming Louisiana native Amy Coney 
Barrett to the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
Deciding whether to confirm a Jus-
tice to the highest Court in the land is 
among the most important duties and 
privileges that a Senator has. We must 
consider the qualifications of the nomi-
nee the President puts forward and de-
termine a nominee’s fitness to serve. 
In this case, President Donald Trump 
made a terrific selection in Amy Coney 
Barrett. The Senate will vote on her 
confirmation in the coming days, and I 
will proudly cast my vote to confirm. 
Here is why: 
Judge Barrett is incredibly qualified 
to serve on the Court. She graduated 
summa cum laude from Notre Dame 
Law School, clerked for the late-Su-
preme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 
and spent 15 years in academia shaping 
a new generation of legal minds. 
According to her students, she was 
not an ideologue but, rather, she would 
listen and take their thoughts and 
process them and bring them to a bet-
ter knowledge of the law. With that,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6439 
October 24, 2020 
she has been universally praised by her 
former students and ultimately served 
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Seventh Circuit. 
Her record and experience show that 
she is ready for the Supreme Court. 
There is some home-State pride. 
Judge Barrett was raised in Metairie, 
LA, and is a graduate of St. Mary’s Do-
minican High School. When I go back 
there, I will see folks with the pen she 
would have received when she grad-
uated, and they are very proud to have 
attended the same school and perhaps 
to have been in the same class. 
As a fellow Louisianan, I am proud 
that one of our own will become a Su-
preme Court Justice. She will be only 
the second person from Louisiana to 
serve on the Court, which, for my 
State, makes the confirmation his-
toric. But it is more than Louisiana 
rooting for Amy Coney Barrett; she 
will serve our country well. 
I will also say that I think it fitting 
that a woman fill the seat that opened 
after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s 
passing. Although she and I had our 
differences in political and judicial phi-
losophy, she should be recognized for 
her service and lifelong pursuit of en-
suring that women have a seat at the 
table. We thank the legacy of Justice 
Ginsburg and her service to the United 
States. 
One of the many things that are no-
table for Justice Ginsburg that I will 
emphasize is that she broadened the 
perspective of SCOTUS—the Supreme 
Court of the United States—as they 
treated the law. I think Judge Barrett 
does the same. She will be the first 
mother of school-age children to serve 
on the Court. She and her husband 
Jesse are raising seven children, two of 
whom were adopted from Haiti and the 
youngest of whom has Down syndrome. 
If there is a mom—whether a working 
mom or not—who wonders if her per-
spective is ever spoken to when cases 
are considered before the Supreme 
Court, Justice Barrett will bring that 
perspective to the Court. 
Finally, I want to thank Judge Bar-
rett for her willingness to serve. To ac-
cept a nomination to the Supreme 
Court is, sadly, to accept ruthless at-
tacks from partisans seeking to score 
political points. Her nomination was 
no different. 
She has been repeatedly attacked for 
being a practicing Catholic. She has 
every right to live her faith. No one in 
public service should be expected to 
cast aside deeply held religious convic-
tions to satisfy an angry mob fabri-
cating reasons to say no. 
Thank you, Judge Barrett, for de-
fending your—and by extension all of 
our—religious liberty. 
I think the balance and the grace she 
exhibited during a very difficult 2 days 
of being before the committee but in 
her life in general is testimony to the 
depth by which she considers the best 
of her faith. 
That said, her political enemies and 
some 
in 
the 
press 
intentionally 
mischaracterized many of her state-
ments, twisting them into new ways to 
attack her, again fabricating reasons 
to say no. Yet Judge Barrett handled 
each attack with grace and dignity. 
During her hearing, she displayed 
time and again that she has the skills, 
the demeanor, and the experience to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
On Monday, I will proudly cast my 
vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to 
the Supreme Court. She will serve our 
country well, and she will serve the fu-
ture generations that will be influ-
enced by her decisions on the Supreme 
Court well. I encourage my colleagues 
to put politics aside and to do the 
same. 
Thank you. 
I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFI-
CER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). The Senator 
from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1112 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are here today on a unique 
Saturday, a day that is not normal, a 
day when the coronavirus is setting 
new records across the United States 
for infection—just yesterday, 85,000 
new cases, which is the very highest 
since 
July—ravaging 
the 
United 
States, and creating untold hardship 
and heartbreak. 
We are in the midst of a raging pan-
demic, but we are not considering 
measures to deal with the pain and 
grief and loss that it has created, the 
threat that it poses to many States 
across the country, providing memo-
ries for many of us in Connecticut who 
went through the worst of these rav-
ages and still suffer, in Connecticut, 
the threat of a new wave. Economic 
crisis grips this country, people are out 
of jobs, and small businesses are fail-
ing, but we are considering a nominee 
who would threaten to decimate our 
healthcare system in the midst of a 
healthcare crisis as we go through this 
pandemic. 
It is a day that is sad, shocking, 
surreal, and it is not normal. It is not 
normal to rush through a nominee for 
the highest Court in the land—a life-
time 
appointment—while 
Americans 
are going to the polls in record num-
bers. Their voices should be heard, and 
the next Senate and the President 
should choose this next Justice. It is 
not normal because we are, in effect, 
ignoring and disregarding the duty we 
have to consider and pass real meas-
ures to address this pandemic and the 
economic crisis we face. 
It is not normal for real people whose 
lives are impacted so severely and po-
tentially even more so in the weeks 
ahead and whose healthcare, reproduc-
tive freedom, protection from gun vio-
lence, workplace rights, civil rights, 
and civil liberties are all threatened by 
this nominee. 
We brought into the hearing room 
those real people from Connecticut and 
all around the country through the 
posters that we had, watching those 
hearings and the nonresponses that 
Amy Coney Barrett gave to our ques-
tions. We brought real lives and the 
real harm they will suffer into that 
hearing room. 
I brought Connor Curran, whose 
treatment has kept him alive only be-
cause his parents were able to use the 
Affordable Care Act for his preexisting 
condition; Julia Gonzalez, who is alive 
because she received treatment for her 
cancer as a result of the ACA making 
it affordable, protecting her as a pre-
existing condition survivor; Samantha, 
a rape survivor, who was able to get an 
abortion because of the protections of 
Roe v. Wade; Tracey, who was able to 
use in vitro fertilization because of re-
productive freedoms that are guaran-
teed by Griswold v. Connecticut and its 
progeny—Amy Coney Barrett has re-
fused to say whether she thought Gris-
wold was correctly decided; Ethan 
Song, who lost his life because of an 
unsafely stored firearm in a friend’s 
home—his parents, Michael and Kristin 
Song, were with me, and so was Ethan; 
Janet Rice, whose son, Shane, then 20 
years old, was killed in downtown 
Hartford; and, of course, the Barton 
family, who lost their beautiful son, 
Daniel, along with 19 other wonderful 
children, in Sandy Hook in that mas-
sacre, and sixth grade educators as 
well. 
Those lives and real people and real 
harms are what are at stake in this de-
bate, and so this Chamber seems so 
surreal on this day, in the midst of 
hardship and heartbreak that would 
only be aggravated by the Justice who 
may be confirmed as early as Monday 
evening. 
She has been selected, screened, and 
vetted to be an activist judge who 
would strike down the Affordable Care 
Act and overturn Roe v. Wade. We 
know that she has passed that ‘‘strong 
test’’—the President’s words, ‘‘strong 
test’’—to legislate from the Bench and 
accomplish through the Court what 
they have been unable to achieve in 
this body, in this Chamber, and in this 
Congress through the legislature. 
They have failed to overturn the Af-
fordable Care Act because the majority 
of American people want that protec-
tion for preexisting conditions. We 
have stood strong on this side against 
those 10, 20, 40 efforts to strike down 
the Affordable Care Act. 
Madam President, she has been vet-
ted and screened for a position on gun 
violence protection that she herself has 
admitted in a speech she gave at Hills-
dale College. It sounds kind of radical. 
It sounds kind of radical, as I said to 
her during the hearing, because it is 
radical. It is part of a radical, extrem-
ist agenda to deny the American people 
State and local laws that protect them 
against assault weapons and large-ca-
pacity magazines, people who are dan-
gerous and should be denied the pur-
chase of firearms because they should 
be screened out through background 
checks and through emergency risk 
protection orders and safe storage 
laws, and repeal of PLCAA. That gives 
gun manufacturers near complete im-
munity from any responsibility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6440 
October 24, 2020 
We are still in the middle of an epi-
demic of gun violence, and among 
those real people who have spoken out 
is a young woman, 19 years old, named 
Tabitha Escalante. I was on a phone 
call with her yesterday with other ad-
vocates. 
She is the judiciary advisory asso-
ciate at March for Our Lives, and she is 
advocating, along with other groups, 
grassroots groups, that have created a 
movement—Giffords, 
Brady, 
Everytown, 
Moms 
Demand 
Action, 
Students Demand Action, Connecticut 
Against Gun Violence, Sandy Hook 
Promise, Newtown Action Alliance— 
along with March for Our Lives. They 
have created a movement that is pre-
vailing, just as we prevailed and 
stopped the legislative branch from 
overturning the Affordable Care Act. 
The strength of this movement has 
caused the NRA and the extreme rad-
ical groups that are supporting it to go 
to the courts, as we documented in a 
report that we released just yesterday. 
I thank my colleague SHELDON WHITE-
HOUSE for spearheading this effort. I 
have been proud to join in various ef-
forts on captured courts. And the re-
port ‘‘What’s at Stake: Gun Safety’’ 
was the reason that Tabitha and I and 
others joined that call yesterday: ‘‘How 
a Corrupted Organization Has Radi-
cally Transformed the Second Amend-
ment.’’ 
It shows how the NRA has been at 
the tip of the spear, working for special 
interests, the gun lobby—dark money 
channeled to put on the court judges, 
at every level, who will stop common-
sense measures on protecting people 
against gun violence. Justice nominee 
Amy Coney Barrett is only the most 
recent of them who have been screened 
and vetted to carry forward that agen-
da. 
These interlocking groups—the fire-
arms industry, retailers, and private 
organizations like American Encore, 
American Future Fund, American Ac-
tion Network, Judicial Crisis Net-
work—have spearheaded this effort, 
and the NRA has been their tool and 
instrument, and judges in the Federal 
courts have been the result. 
The fact of the matter is that they 
are turning to the legislatures because 
of the strength of this grassroots move-
ment—not its weakness—and their ef-
forts to repeal the ACA have failed. So 
have their efforts to block those meas-
ures in State legislatures and local 
governments. 
In fact, gun violence prevention was 
on the ballot in 2018, and gun violence 
prevention won. That is the reason 
that the House of Representatives 
passed a universal background check 
measure and other steps that are so 
important and should be done here. 
In the past 10 years, in fact, this 
scourge and epidemic of gun violence 
has continued with more than 236 mass 
shootings in this country. Those mass 
shootings have taken 1,300 lives, in-
cluding those innocent children and 
educators at Sandy Hook. 
In the past 10 years, gun violence has 
taken more than 350,000 lives—in rural 
communities, urban communities, and 
every community across the United 
States. Gun violence is an insidious 
public health menace, a public health 
epidemic that affects every commu-
nity. 
Amid this public health epidemic, 
Republicans have vetted and screened 
this nominee to take Justice Gins-
burg’s place on the Supreme Court be-
cause of her extreme views, as she ar-
ticulated in her dissent in Kanter v. 
Barr. She showed an alarming willing-
ness to stretch the founding-era his-
tory to support her extreme and expan-
sive view of the Second Amendment. 
Her views are not only out of the main-
stream; they are out of the position ar-
ticulated by Justice Scalia, her men-
tor. 
But the fact of the matter is that the 
threat to these gun violence prevention 
measures is real and urgent. Cases are 
literally one step away—remember, one 
step away—from the Supreme Court. 
There are three cases challenging re-
strictions on assault weapons and 
large-capacity magazines, two of them 
from California that are about to be pe-
titioned for a review of certiorari at 
the U.S. Supreme Court. Two cases 
challenging limits on open carry and 
three cases challenging background 
check and licensing requirements are 
one step away from the Supreme Court, 
possibly this term, when Amy Coney 
Barrett would take her seat. 
With her nomination, every single 
commonsense 
violence 
prevention 
measure at every level of government 
is in great peril. The public safety and 
health stakes of her nomination could 
not be greater. As Tabitha said, ‘‘Noth-
ing less than everything is at stake.’’ 
‘‘Nothing less than everything is at 
stake’’—and not just now when these 
cases are one step away, but for dec-
ades to come. 
Tabitha’s generation may have chil-
dren, even grandchildren, who will see 
Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme 
Court Bench, if she is confirmed, and 
district 
court 
and 
appellate 
court 
judges 
whom 
we 
have 
confirmed 
through this effort to reshape the 
courts in the image of the far right, of 
what used to be the Republican Party— 
one step away from this disaster. 
Likewise, on the issue of reproduc-
tive freedom, Judge Barrett was also 
vetted and screened. At the hearing, 
she refused to say—absolutely refused 
to say—whether Roe was correctly de-
cided. As you know, Roe protects a 
woman’s right to choose after being 
raped, as Samantha was. We presented 
her story. 
It is constitutional to make in vitro 
fertilization a crime if Roe is over-
turned. It is constitutional to make it 
a crime for doctors to perform abor-
tions. She refused to answer that ques-
tion as well. But, in a way, she didn’t 
really need to answer those questions 
because we know where she stands. She 
described Roe’s legacy as barbaric in a 
letter and ad that she aligned herself 
with. 
She has called, in effect, through or-
ganizations 
with 
which 
she 
was 
aligned, for the unborn ‘‘to be pro-
tected in law.’’ She aligned herself with 
a group on legal positions—I am not 
talking about moral beliefs—pushing 
the most extreme legal views on repro-
ductive care, which include criminal-
izing IVF, criminalizing doctors, end-
ing legalized abortion in this country. 
Her extreme views on reproductive 
freedoms once were disqualifying, but 
it is the reason why Donald Trump 
chose her in the first place—his strong 
test on that issue. 
Right now, there are 17 abortion-re-
lated cases that are one step away from 
the Supreme Court. There are chal-
lenges to bans on abortion as early as 
6 weeks into pregnancy, before many 
women even know they are pregnant. 
There are bans on abortion later in 
pregnancy, when women can face the 
most severe health risks and rely on 
their doctors for accurate information 
and compassionate care. 
They are reason-based bans that 
merely exist as a pretext—and I say 
‘‘reason-based ban’’—for interrogating 
and intimidating women who seek an 
abortion. They are redtape laws that 
require abortion providers to jump 
through hoops that serve no medical 
purpose but merely exist to burden 
them and make necessary abortion 
services harder and harder to obtain— 
and numerous other abortion laws de-
signed to limit access—strictly to limit 
access in the name of healthcare, par-
ticularly for poor, rural, and immi-
grant women who simply cannot afford 
to make trips to clinics hundreds of 
miles away. They are laws that impede 
racial justice, human justice. 
Access to reproductive care is al-
ready hanging by a thread across the 
country. Judge Barrett’s nomination 
imperils what access remains. Those 
cases are just one step away—one step 
away—from decisions by the Court 
that Judge Barrett would join. 
So there is a great deal of our funda-
mental rights at stake here. As Tab-
itha said, ‘‘Nothing less than every-
thing is at stake.’’ These cases that are 
one step away from decision are only 17 
cases involving reproductive freedom, 
14 cases involving gun violence preven-
tion, and there are numerous others in-
volving workplace safety. 
The Affordable Care Act will be ar-
gued a week after the election, when 
she would sit on the Court. Her hos-
tility to the Affordable Care Act is well 
documented by now in her criticizing 
Chief Justice Roberts for his vote to 
uphold the act, saying he had to 
stretch the meaning of it to keep it 
alive, her saying in King v. Burwell, 
when she spoke about that case, that 
the dissent had the better of the argu-
ment. These are real rights for real 
people that would be lost. 
Instead of imperiling healthcare and 
other rights that should be enjoyed by 
the American people, we should be en-
acting measures that are before us

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6441 
October 24, 2020 
right now that have been passed by the 
House of Representatives, by bipar-
tisan majorities, that would actually 
address the needs and challenges of the 
American people during this extraor-
dinary time in our history. 
They are before us right now. There 
is no need to write them anew. There is 
no need to invent the words or the pur-
poses for these acts. 
In order to proceed to the consider-
ation of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act—bipartisan legisla-
tion to close the Charleston loophole, 
extending the initial background check 
review period from 3 to 10 days, and 
eliminating that loophole for gun pur-
chases which enabled the Charleston 
shooter to get his weapon and murder 
people in the basement of a church and 
others around the country to endanger 
and kill innocent Americans, embody-
ing the principle of ‘‘no check, no 
sale,’’ that must be the rule—I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The Senate is currently considering 
the qualifications of an excellent nomi-
nee to be on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. That is why we are here. 
It is very important work. This request 
is nothing more than another form of 
procedural harassment by the minority 
to try and stop our process of consid-
ering Amy Coney Barrett for the Su-
preme Court of the United States. It is 
certainly unfair to her. It is unbecom-
ing of this Chamber. 
If this bill was so important to the 
Democrats 
in 
the 
Senate, 
they 
wouldn’t have voted four times to ad-
journ until after the election. So, 
clearly, this is just a stunt. 
By the way, if that wasn’t reason 
enough, the bill that the Senator is 
suggesting we get into would put oner-
ous burdens on law-abiding Americans 
who just want to protect themselves at 
a time when Democratic mayors and 
Governors are overseeing all kinds of 
damage to life and health and property 
unchecked. In fact, calling off the law 
enforcement of their communities to 
protect our citizens, they now want to 
take away the rights of those citizens 
to be able to purchase arms or at least 
make it much more difficult. 
For these reasons and several others, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, what my colleague calls proce-
dural harassment, it is actually democ-
racy. It is legislation. It was passed by 
the House. It is bipartisan. The major-
ity was bipartisan. It will save lives. I 
fail to understand why my Republican 
colleagues will not allow this loop-
hole—it is a fatal and defective loop-
hole in our current laws—to be re-
paired. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 7 
Madam President, let me move to an-
other measure. In order to proceed to 
the consideration of H.R. 7, Paycheck 
Fairness Act—again, bipartisan legisla-
tion that would empower women to 
challenge pay discrimination in the 
workplace, passing the House by a bi-
partisan majority and giving women 
the power to hold employers account-
able for discriminatory practices, mak-
ing a tremendous difference in their 
lives—I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to legislative ses-
sion on the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
This is yet one more obstructionist 
move to prevent us from taking up 
Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme 
Court of the United States, a highly- 
qualified nominee who deserves her 
time in the Chamber. She deserves her 
time in debate and not these other ex-
ternal matters that, by the way, if they 
were important to the Senate minor-
ity, they would not have voted four 
times this week to adjourn until after 
the election. 
For that reason and several others, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, the so-called external matters go 
to the heart of fairness in the work-
place, equal pay for equal work, dis-
criminatory practices, other kinds of 
injustices that have existed for years— 
women ought to have the right to chal-
lenge them and hold their employers 
accountable. What could be more fun-
damental and important? 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1423 
Madam President, let me move now 
to H.R. 1423, in order to proceed to con-
sideration of the Forced Arbitration 
Injustice Repeal Act, also known as the 
FAIR Act, which passed the House on 
September 20, 2019—again, a bipartisan 
measure, which would increase Ameri-
cans’ rights to seek justice and ac-
countability through the court system. 
We are in the midst of considering a 
nominee who has expressed a hostility 
to seeking justice in the workplace and 
in jobs and in other areas. So this 
measure to eliminate forced arbitra-
tion clauses in employment and con-
sumer and civil rights cases is espe-
cially relevant. It would allow con-
sumers and workers to agree to arbi-
tration after a dispute occurs, but it 
would not force them to do so. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
I will not allow the Senate to be di-
verted from the issue at hand, and that 
is the consideration and of Amy Coney 
Barrett to be an Associate Justice on 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. She is a highly-qualified nomi-
nee and deserves this debate. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4443 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, in order to proceed to the consid-
eration of the Lori Jackson Domestic 
Violence Survivor Protection Act—be-
cause millions of women are still at 
risk as a consequence of this loophole 
in our present laws that enables dan-
gerous, estranged spouses or partners 
to have access to weapons during the 
most perilous time in a domestic dis-
pute right after separation, because 
that 
loophole 
endangers 
innocent 
women because it provides access to 
weapons to those dangerous people—I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
Again, if the minority was serious 
about passing legislation, they would 
not have voted four times to adjourn 
until after the election, so it is a little 
hard to take this seriously, but it is es-
pecially difficult on this one because 
Federal law already prohibits violent 
felons from owning and purchasing 
firearms. 
Again, should I remind the Senate 
and the country that Democratic may-
ors and Governors all over this country 
have failed to protect their citizens. 
The last thing we would want to do at 
a time like this when citizens are left 
to defend themselves against violent 
crime is to prohibit law-abiding Ameri-
cans or make it more difficult for law- 
abiding Americans to own firearms. 
For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, just to remind my colleague, this 
measure doesn’t pertain only to dan-
gerous felons. It protects innocent 
women 
against 
dangerous 
people. 
There is already the provision for pro-
tective orders to provide that kind of 
safeguard after a period of time. This 
measure would close a loophole for the 
first period when, in fact, women and 
others are at greatest risk. 
It is a public safety measure that is 
particularly relevant because of the 
hostility expressed by this nominee to 
commonsense steps in the name of a 
very extreme view under the Second 
Amendment. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 840 
Madam President, I would like to ask 
that we proceed to consideration of 
H.R. 840, the Veterans’ Access to Child 
Care Act—what could be less con-
troversial, 
a 
bill 
that 
provides 
childcare assistance to veterans receiv-
ing covered healthcare services in a VA 
facility?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6442 
October 24, 2020 
The bill highlights the troubling fact 
that lack of childcare can dissuade par-
ents 
from 
receiving 
essential 
healthcare services. It would make per-
manent a VA childcare pilot program— 
make it permanent. 
It was first introduced in 2011, and it 
expands access to childcare assistance 
nationwide, allowing veterans to re-
ceive medical treatment with con-
fidence that their children are receiv-
ing high-quality care—our veterans. 
Whatever motions have been made in 
the past, this measure certainly needs 
to be considered. It was passed by a 
majority in the House on February 8 of 
2019, more than a year ago, a bipartisan 
majority in the House—no action here. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
Can we just be a little more honest? 
This is not about childcare. What is 
going on here is not about childcare, 
for veterans, or for anybody else. This 
is another attempt to prevent us from 
talking about the outstanding quali-
fications of Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
to be on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
I will stand here all day and object if 
that is what it takes for my other col-
leagues to get to the floor and talk 
about the merits of this outstanding 
judge. With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2722 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, as more important as that health 
for veterans is, equally so is assistance 
for our election system. We are going 
through an election right now. Even as 
we consider this nominee, tens of mil-
lions of Americans are voting. The 
threat to our election security is well- 
known. We face not only foreign inter-
ference but also domestic threats, as 
has been documented. 
I have been through those absolutely 
chilling briefings in a classified set-
ting; we are sworn to secrecy. But the 
malign foreign interference makes 2016, 
in my impression, look like child’s 
play from Russia, Iran, the Chinese. 
In order to proceed to the consider-
ation of H.R. 2722, Securing American 
Federal Elections Act, a bill that 
would, in fact, make critical invest-
ments to upgrade our voting systems 
to protect against foreign interference 
in our elections and democracy by re-
quiring all voting systems to produce a 
verifiable paper ballot and by author-
izing funding for States to bolster elec-
tion security—what could be more ur-
gent and important at this moment in 
our history? 
It was passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives on June 27, 2019—again, 
more than a year ago. No action here. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The only interference going on here 
is by Senate Democrats trying to inter-
fere in our discussion about an out-
standing nominee to the Supreme 
Court of the United States, Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett. For that reason, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 4894 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, in order to proceed to the consid-
eration of H.R. 4894, Congressional 
Budget Justification Transparency Act 
of 2020, a bill that requires Federal 
agencies to make budget justification 
materials available to the public—it is 
a transparency measure. It requires 
disclosure, and it requires the Office of 
Management and Budget to make cer-
tain details regarding the materials 
available to the public, including a list 
of agencies that submit budget jus-
tification. 
It also forces disclosure of the dates 
that materials are submitted to Con-
gress and posted online and links to 
the materials—a basic disclosure meas-
ure. It was passed, again, overwhelm-
ingly by the House of Representatives 
on September 14 of this year, without 
any action so far in this body. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
It is really time to move on and hear 
from other colleagues about the incred-
ible, 
outstanding 
qualifications 
of 
President Trump’s nominee to the Su-
preme Court of the United States, 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett. These dis-
tractions cannot prevent us from doing 
that. 
On this bill in particular, I think peo-
ple should know that most of the docu-
ments that they are talking about 
are—in fact, almost all of them are on-
line today. 
For that reason and others, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. That measure 
was a basic disclosure step proposed to 
address secrecy in government. Noth-
ing is more fundamental than trans-
parency in a democracy. Sunlight is 
the best disinfectant. 
The people of the United States de-
serve that information, and so, too, 
they deserve all of the information 
about Amy Coney Barrett. Even on the 
morning of her approval by the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, new documents 
were disclosed, new statements and 
speeches by her, adding to the ones 
that hadn’t been disclosed properly 
previously. 
This process is a sham. It is rushed. 
It is not normal. As I said during our 
hearings, my great fear is not only the 
damage and the harm that this nomi-
nee can do, but the damage and harm 
to the Court itself. 
The President said the quiet part out 
loud. He wants this nominee rushed to 
the bench so she can decide the elec-
tion, not the voters—so she can sit on 
the Supreme Court when the election 
goes to the courts. 
Well, my Republican colleagues have 
the majority. They may have the 
votes, but they don’t have the Amer-
ican people, and they don’t have his-
tory on their side. Might does not 
make right. They can do it because 
they have the votes. They are doing it 
because they can. 
Amy Coney Barrett could stonewall 
our questions because she could and es-
tablish a new standard—call it the 
‘‘Barrett rule’’—of not answering. But 
the damage to the Court will be great. 
The Court has power because of its 
legitimacy. The trust and confidence of 
the American people are in its inde-
pendence. Our Republican colleagues 
are whittling away and eventually dev-
astating not only the authority of the 
Supreme Court, but all of our Federal 
courts, by politicizing and polarizing 
it. 
She would not even commit that she 
would recuse herself in the event an 
election case went to the Supreme 
Court. I have tremendous respect—even 
reverence—for the Court, having served 
there as a law clerk with Justice Harry 
Blackmun, having argued four cases 
before the Court, including three with 
Justice Ginsburg. 
This imperils the legitimacy of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, is a grave, lasting, 
potentially devastating disservice to 
the American people. It is a dagger at 
the heart of the Court and of our de-
mocracy. Therefore, I will continue to 
oppose this nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
DAINES). The Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4797 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
General Secretary Xi is a dictator and 
human rights violator. He is yet an-
other Communist leader trying to be 
the dominant world power. 
The Chinese Communist Party is 
stripping the people of Hong Kong of 
their freedoms, cracking down on dis-
sidents, militarizing the South China 
Sea, supporting Maduro’s genocide in 
Venezuela, surveilling its citizens, and 
imprisoning 
more 
than 
1 
million 
Uighurs in internment camps simply 
because of their religion. 
Communist 
China 
is 
committing 
genocide 
against 
the 
Uighurs. 
It 
doesn’t end there. Recent reports indi-
cate that the Communist Party of 
China is attempting the same thing in 
Tibet, forcing hundreds of thousands of 
people in Tibet into mass labor camps. 
We 
know 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party and their puppets continue to si-
lence and intimidate those standing up

October 24, 2020 
for democracy and human rights. They 
detain and harass journalists to try 
and prevent the truth from getting out. 
Foreigners and journalists working and 
traveling in Communist China do so at 
their own risk. 
Just last week, Communist China 
began threatening to take Americans 
as hostages. The national security 
threat of Communist China cannot be 
taken lightly. The censorship of these 
human rights abuses cannot be ig-
nored. 
General Secretary Xi doesn’t want us 
to know about the oppression occur-
ring under his regime. For years, the 
Communist Government in China has 
tried to push its propaganda in Amer-
ica through state-owned media outlets 
while refusing to treat American jour-
nalists in China fairly. We saw this 
firsthand earlier this year. Chinese- 
backed 
propaganda 
outlets 
peddled 
China’s lies about the coronavirus and 
endangered the lives of Americans. 
In March, the Chinese Communist 
Party expelled more than a dozen U.S. 
journalists and required other outlets 
to submit written reports of their staff, 
finances, operations, and real estate in 
China. We cannot allow this mistreat-
ment to continue, and we have to take 
action. 
I am proud to sponsor the Chinese- 
Backed Media Accountability Act to 
create accountability for Communist 
China’s censorship of free speech and 
failure to treat American journalists 
fairly. My bill prevents new visas to 
Chinese-backed journalists until we 
know exactly how many Chinese propa-
ganda journalists are operating in the 
United States, and it creates reci-
procity by making sure the number of 
Chinese-backed 
journalists 
in 
the 
United States is equal to the amount of 
independent American journalists al-
lowed in China. 
We have to stand up and say that this 
behavior by Communist China is unac-
ceptable, and I look forward to all of 
my colleagues’ supporting this pro-
posal. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4797 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, Senator 
SCOTT has sought unanimous consent 
for a bill that would restrict the 
issuance of nonimmigrant visas to Chi-
nese journalists and a number of other 
steps that, frankly, are already within 
the President’s power to do. 
The bill, in many ways, is an attempt 
to codify authorities that the State De-
partment already has. In that sense, 
there is no reason to take legislative 
action. If the President wants to use 
this power, he can. 
But I want to emphasize the point 
that we share the goals that are behind 
this measure. No. 1, the goal of increas-
ing transparency around the pandemic 
has to be done so that the Chinese and 
other authorities around the world— 
states that suffer from the pandemic— 
make the facts known to this country 
and the world health authority. 
We share the goal of condemning Chi-
na’s 
absolutely 
despicable 
human 
rights abuses, its deplorable record of 
subjugating human liberty, including 
the Uighurs, at least 1 million of whom 
are being held in Chinese Government- 
run detention centers that the Presi-
dent of the United States has com-
pletely ignored. 
But this legislation would really do 
nothing to address these incredibly op-
pressing issues. It uses the pandemic 
and China’s human rights abuses as a 
pretense for deflecting blame for the 
President’s shameful mishandling of 
the COVID–19 crisis. The President’s 
ineptitude and incompetence are wide-
ly known to the American people. 
We share the goals of stopping Chi-
nese human rights abuses, of making 
them more honest and accurate in 
what they disclose, and other goals, 
but to this measure, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I am disappointed my Democratic col-
league doesn’t want to focus on the 
global impact of General Secretary 
Xi’s censorship. I clearly don’t under-
stand why my Democratic colleagues 
refuse to stand up to Communist 
China. They have stopped every at-
tempt to protect Americans from this 
threat. 
Again and again, the Democrats 
block efforts to hold Communist China 
accountable and never try to work 
with us to come up with solutions. 
They blocked my resolution to move 
the 2022 Olympics out of Communist 
China. They blocked my bill to prevent 
Communist China from stealing or sab-
otaging American COVID–19 vaccine 
research, even as American lives de-
pend on the rapid development of this 
vaccine. 
Now they are turning a blind eye to 
the censorship of American journalists 
in China. Chinese state-backed journal-
ists in America push the propaganda of 
the Chinese Communist Party. It is 
time to wake up and understand that 
the oppression at the hand of General 
Secretary Xi and the Chinese Govern-
ment Party will not stop. 
This is about the safety of Americans 
and about freedom around the world. 
This is about standing up for human 
rights. 
We must act, and passing the Chi-
nese-Backed Media Accountability Act 
takes real steps to hold Communist 
China accountable for their failure to 
treat American journalists fairly. 
I am not going to stop working to 
make sure there is reciprocity between 
our nations and that we understand 
how many Chinese propaganda journal-
ists are operating in the United States. 
We must, together, do everything in 
our power to fight for freedom and hold 
Communist China and General Sec-
retary Xi accountable, and I hope, at 
some point, my Democratic colleagues 
will join me in this fight. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, 2 years 
ago, I was a candidate running for this 
job, running against a Democratic in-
cumbent. The top issues of the race 
throughout the summer were things 
like the sanctity of human life, and 
most important in the minds of the 
voters—at least based on our polls— 
were law and order. The idea that a 
sanctuary city, much less several of 
them, could exist to protect violent 
criminals as long as they were here il-
legally was an absurd notion to Dako-
tans. They were good issues for me as a 
candidate. 
That all changed just a little over 2 
years ago, when Senate Democrats 
waged an attack on President Trump’s 
nominee to fill the vacancy that oc-
curred by the retirement of Supreme 
Court Justice Kennedy. By ‘‘attack,’’ I 
don’t mean engage in a vigorous debate 
about Brett Kavanaugh’s political and 
judicial philosophy or his background. 
Rather, they waged an attack on Brett 
Kavanaugh himself, on his character, 
his reputation, and his family—and not 
with facts but with fabrications. 
My opponent, North Dakota’s junior 
Senator, joined the smear campaign 
and changed the priorities of our cam-
paign quickly from sanctuary cities to, 
suddenly, the Supreme Court of the 
United States. That happened just 2 
years and a couple of weeks ago. As 
much as anything—as much as any rea-
son, as much as any issue—the Su-
preme Court is why I am here today. I 
do not mean just today. I mean it is 
why I am a U.S. Senator. 
So, when President Trump nomi-
nated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill 
the vacancy created by the death of 
Justice Bader Ginsburg, I knew there 
could be no amount of political harass-
ment that would cause me to shrink 
from this obligation. The suggestion 
that I or my colleagues would squander 
this—the right and the responsibility 
under the Constitution—and consider 
waiting until after an election that 
may create an opportunity for someone 
with whom my constituents don’t 
agree to be nominated to the Court 
would be a dereliction of my duty and 
would rightly enrage the people who 
sent me here for exactly this moment. 
I refuse to shrink. 
So let’s talk about the nominee, 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett. By all ac-
counts, she is a brilliant jurist. I don’t 
think anybody has really questioned

her scholarship, her intellect. Cer-
tainly, you couldn’t argue as to her de-
meanor. She has, on national display, 
demonstrated a demeanor that we 
should probably all aspire to but, cer-
tainly, for somebody who aspires to be 
on the highest Court in the land. Oh, 
by the way, I love the fact that she was 
educated in middle America. With all 
due respect to my conservative jurist 
friends and acquaintances and even 
those I don’t know from someplace 
other than middle America, it is aw-
fully nice to see one get to the top. 
My conversations with Judge Barrett 
were like, I think, everybody’s. They 
were pleasant, and they were serious. 
In some cases, they were, maybe, even 
a little bit intense, but my conversa-
tion didn’t focus on hardly any of the 
things I have been hearing about with 
relation to her nomination—in fact, 
none of them have I heard about in this 
Chamber today, and we have heard 
about lots of them. Mine didn’t even 
really focus on the hot-button issues of 
the day. My discussions focused on my 
inquiry of her—about her sense and her 
philosophy and her thoughts on fed-
eralism. What is the appropriate role of 
States in this cooperative federalism— 
this wonderful experiment that is the 
United States of America? This is a 
system designed by the States. The 
Federal Government was created by 
the States. The Federal Government 
didn’t create the States. No, the States 
created the Federal Government. It is 
foundational. 
I, of course, like the Presiding Offi-
cer, was a State-elected official. I was 
never the Governor, but I was prob-
ably, in many respects, qualified in a 
way, today, that never occurred to me 
at the time, which was that I was a 
regulator. I was a State regulator who 
had been elected by the people of my 
State to regulate things like rates of 
gas and electrical utilities, to cite 
things like pipelines and transmission 
lines and powerplants and wind farms, 
and to oversee the Federal Commu-
nications Act and its application in 
North Dakota. From that perch as a 
State regulator for nearly 10 years, by 
far, the greatest problems and the 
greatest obstacles to doing my job were 
the 
mandates 
coming 
from 
Wash-
ington, DC, and its trying to impose its 
mediocrity on North Dakota’s excel-
lence. 
So, when I came to Washington, I set 
out to change some of that. I wanted to 
try to change our bureaucracy a little 
bit and find somebody in this place who 
understood and respected the role of 
the States in this cooperative fed-
eralism, because what I saw and what I 
continue to see is a big bureaucracy 
that is trying to run right over—roll 
right over—the States of this country. 
I think that the overriding issue of the 
role of States and of federalism gets to 
the heart of lots of these other smaller 
issues, of lots of these more granular 
issues. 
Now, whether it is the waters of the 
United States and what is a navigable 
water—that is one of the big ones, 
right? The Clean Power Plan and its 
imposition on local and State regula-
tion is another, and how the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission deals 
with grid reliability. Maybe it is some-
thing even more granular like cross- 
State emissions. Who knows? There are 
lots of them—lots and lots of them—in 
areas where it has really been the 
courts themselves. Whether it is the 
Supreme Court or the appellate court 
or the district court, it has really been 
the courts—the judiciary—that have 
been the only thing standing between 
an overbearing Federal Government 
and the rights of States. 
So my discussions with Judge Bar-
rett centered around her views on fed-
eralism. I gave her some examples, 
some North Dakota examples. I even 
laid the blame on Congress, and we de-
serve a lot of it, for sure. We have 
passed broad authorizations for the bu-
reaucracy and then let them fill in the 
blanks. We have to stop doing that. We 
need to be more proscriptive. In the 
meantime, I want to be sure that we 
have a Supreme Court that under-
stands the sovereignty of States. 
I mean, right now, North Dakota is 
engaged in several pieces of litigation 
with our own Federal Government, and 
this is under Trump’s Department of 
Justice. I just wish the lawyers at the 
Department of Justice would take on 
the bad actors in the political class 
with the same zeal with which they 
take on my State. By the way, there 
are much bigger things they could be 
taking on when they take on the polit-
ical class, if they would just do it, than 
the little things, where they should be 
negotiating settlements with the State 
of North Dakota. I just wish they had 
the same zeal for that. That would be 
much more worthy of the title of ‘‘jus-
tice.’’ 
Yes, I am very pleased with Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett’s philosophy and 
demeanor, but I was really grateful for 
her answers on the issue of the role of 
States in a cooperative Federalist sys-
tem like ours. Yet, at the end of the 
day, judicial philosophy, intellect, and 
where one went to college is all just 
shored up by the fact that she is a per-
son of incredible virtue—yes, a virtue 
that is grounded in faith. That is, after 
all, where most virtue comes from. In 
fact, I suspect that some of those vir-
tues that used to be more universal in 
our country are part of why the left de-
spises her so much. 
As for me, I am just glad that she is 
willing to do it. I am glad that her fam-
ily is willing to stand with her and do 
it. I am glad that she has the virtues of 
faith that underpin the intellect and 
the experience and the demeanor. In 
fact, perhaps, it is why she has all of 
those other things. For those reasons 
and several others, it is going to be a 
pleasure—it is even going to be an 
honor—to stay the night tomorrow 
night, if that is what we have to do, to 
cast the vote for Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett to become the next Associate 
Justice on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I am 
here to talk about my support for con-
firming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to 
the United States Supreme Court. 
Judge Barrett’s qualifications and 
her character are indisputable. I had 
the honor of meeting with Judge Bar-
rett earlier this month when she said 
her guiding principles as a judge were 
in the mold of a great Justice—the late 
Justice Antonin Scalia. In fact, during 
our meeting and over the course of her 
hearing before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, 
Judge 
Barrett 
dem-
onstrated her understanding of the pur-
pose of the U.S. Supreme Court and the 
proper role of a judge. 
Judge Barrett believes that judges 
shouldn’t legislate from the bench. 
Keep in mind that she is currently a 
sitting judge on the Seventh Circuit 
Court. She won’t misuse her power as a 
judge to impose her policy preferences, 
and she won’t twist the original and 
the true meaning of the Constitution 
to advance a political agenda of any 
kind. Judge Barrett will uphold our 
cherished constitutional rights, includ-
ing the Second Amendment. 
I have an A-plus rating from the Na-
tional Rifle Association and the Mon-
tana Shooting Sports Association. I 
firmly believe that a correct under-
standing—a profound understanding— 
of the Second Amendment is essential. 
In the discussions I had with Judge 
Barrett, she confirmed she has that un-
derstanding. Judge Barrett’s strong 
support of the Second Amendment can 
give every law-abiding Montanan who 
owns a firearm the full confidence that 
she will never allow the government to 
take away our guns. She understands 
what ‘‘shall not infringe’’ truly means. 
I believe Judge Barrett will stop Con-
gress in its tracks when it exceeds its 
limited constitutional powers. For dec-
ades, Congress has imposed policies 
that this body has had no authority in 
creating in the first place. Judge Bar-
rett will ensure that Congress stays 
within its limited constitutional pow-
ers while returning powers to the 
States and back to the people. She will 
defend the Constitution. She will pro-
tect our Montana way of life, including 
our Montana jobs. Judge Barrett will 
not bend to the radical fringe groups 
that are looking to kill Montana tim-
ber and coal jobs. She will be a fair-
minded Justice whom Montanans will 
be proud of. 
Yet some on the far left not only op-
pose Amy Coney Barrett’s confirma-
tion but have also said they are open to 
packing the Supreme Court with lib-
eral judges. Let me just define what 
‘‘packing’’ means. That means increas-
ing the number of Justices on the Su-
preme Court from 9, which has been the 
case for 151 years, to 11 or 13 or more, 
perhaps. That will be an attack on our

Montana way of life. I stand with Mon-
tanans in strongly opposing this dan-
gerous 
power-grab 
proposal. 
With 
Judge Barrett on the Supreme Court, 
the age of activist Justices rewriting 
the laws to accomplish their own pol-
icy agendas will be gone. 
She is a mother of seven children— 
five biologically and two adopted Hai-
tian children. We will have a Supreme 
Court Justice whom we can also call a 
minivan mom. Judge Barrett is an in-
spiration to professional women, to 
working moms, and to school-aged 
girls across Montana who can feel cer-
tain there is no American dream that 
women cannot achieve. 
Just last week, I met with several 
northwest 
Montana 
businesswomen 
leaders in Kalispell to talk about their 
support for Judge Barrett’s confirma-
tion. These Montana businesswomen 
shared their views of Judge Barrett as 
a mentor, a role model, a wife, a moth-
er, a brilliant jurist, and a great leader. 
I would also like to take a moment 
to congratulate and thank President 
Trump 
for 
nominating 
such 
out-
standing and well-qualified individuals 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. With Judge 
Barrett’s confirmation, we will take 
another major step toward restoring 
the Founding Fathers’ vision for the 
Supreme Court and the separation of 
powers they brilliantly created. 
As a U.S. Senator from Montana, 
supporting Judge Barrett’s confirma-
tion to the Supreme Court is an easy 
call. She is someone whom Montanans 
can be proud of and whom Montanans 
can look up to on the Court. 
I urge all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 758 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak 
about an effort that, frankly, I never 
envisioned I would have to, something 
that is so beyond radical, and that is 
packing the U.S. Supreme Court. 
This plan, hatched by a Democratic 
President in 1937, was so radical then 
that it was soundly defeated here in 
the U.S. Senate—a Senate, I might add, 
in which 76 of the 96 Members were 
Democrats. 
This was a plan that was so hostile to 
institutional principles that the Senate 
Judiciary Committee in 1937 said that 
it was ‘‘a measure which should be so 
emphatically rejected that its parallel 
will never again be presented to the 
free representatives of the free people 
of America.’’ 
In fact, as recently as 2019, the bril-
liant late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
stated: ‘‘I think it was a bad idea when 
President Franklin Roosevelt tried to 
pack the court . . . and if anything 
would make the court look partisan, it 
would be that.’’ 
Well, today we find ourselves in the 
same spot, and the reason why is sim-
ple: The Democratic Party still does 
not accept the legitimacy of President 
Trump or his highly qualified judicial 
nominees. 
Don’t forget it was just earlier this 
year that the Democratic leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, stood in front of the Su-
preme Court and openly threatened 
President Trump’s two Supreme Court 
picks if they didn’t vote the way he 
wanted by saying, ‘‘I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch, 
I 
want 
to 
tell 
you, 
Kavanaugh: You have released the 
whirlwind and you will pay the price. 
You won’t know what hit you if you go 
forward with these awful decisions.’’ 
That is disturbing—disturbing, indeed. 
Let’s be clear. This is nothing more 
than an attempt at a partisan power 
grab by Democrats. You see, packing 
the Supreme Court by moving from the 
current 9 Justices to 11 or 13 would es-
sentially eliminate the Supreme Court 
from being a check and a balance on 
Congress and the executive branch, 
paving the way for a radical, far-left 
agenda put forth by CHUCK SCHUMER 
and the Democrats if they get the ma-
jority. 
Packing the Supreme Court is a di-
rect attack on our Montana way of life. 
Packing the Supreme Court with activ-
ist, liberal Justices will help the far- 
left radicals strip away our Second 
Amendment rights, destroy good-pay-
ing energy and natural resource jobs, 
and cripple the Montana and American 
economy by blocking forest manage-
ment and energy projects. 
For us in Montana, we know exactly 
what it means to have an activist, lib-
eral judge on the bench. Look no fur-
ther than Judge Brian Morris of Mon-
tana. Judge Morris has done every-
thing in his power to try to kill Mon-
tana’s energy jobs. In fact, he specifi-
cally blocked the Keystone XL Pipe-
line. This project would create thou-
sands of jobs and generate tens of mil-
lions of tax dollars every year for Mon-
tana schools and Montana commu-
nities. 
Packing the Supreme Court will also 
erode a major principle of our Con-
stitution; that is, the separation of 
powers into three coequal branches of 
government. 
Packing 
the 
Supreme 
Court would simply make the Court an 
extension of the legislative branch. It 
is the independence of the judiciary 
that is essential to check and balance 
both the executive and legislative 
branches. Packing the Court would 
simply turn the U.S. Supreme Court 
into an extension of whatever political 
party happens to control the White 
House and the Senate. 
Here is how it would work: Which-
ever President is in power, if they have 
the same party in power in the Senate, 
they could keep escalating the number 
of Justices. It would go from 11 to 13 to 
15 to 17. It would absolutely spin out of 
control, and our Founding Fathers 
would be rolling over in their graves. 
The packed Court would simply turn 
the Supreme Court into an extension of 
whichever political party happens to 
control the White House and the Sen-
ate. 
So I am here today to call out the 
shameful partisan attack on our judici-
ary, and I hope the rest of my col-
leagues will join me in passing this res-
olution that calls for the Supreme 
Court to simply remain as it has been 
for 151 years at nine Justices. That is 
all it says—we are going to keep the 
Supreme Court at nine Justices. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to consideration of S. Res. 758, 
submitted earlier today. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Reserving the 
right to object, I would open with the 
observation that—well, let me start by 
saying that in one of the great plays in 
our language, the opening began with 
the observation that ‘‘something is rot-
ten in the state of Denmark.’’ 
There is increasing evidence that 
something is rotten across that lawn 
and across First Street at the U.S. Su-
preme Court. What is the evidence of 
that? Well, the first thing I would sug-
gest is the amount of anonymous dark 
money influencers swirling around the 
Court. 
I have spent a good deal of my profes-
sional life around appellate courts. I 
have never seen—nor does the history 
of the Supreme Court evidence—any-
thing like what is taking place right 
now 
with 
dark 
money 
influencers 
swirling like eels around that Court. 
How do they do it? Well, they are in-
volved in the selection process through 
a group called the Federalist Society, 
which takes large, anonymous, dark- 
money contributions and controls the 
selection of judges. How do we know it 
controls the selection of judges? Don-
ald Trump has said so. 
The Wall Street Journal has said this 
was a subcontracting operation—a sub-
contracting operation—and it worked. 
It is not a good thing when the selec-
tion of our Supreme Court is subcon-
tracted out to a private group that 
then takes multimillion-dollar anony-
mous donations. It shouldn’t be hard 
for Members to understand that is a 
dangerous set of facts. 
Then you go on to the campaigns for 
those selected nominees, and you see 
more 
anonymous 
donors 
writing 
checks for as much as $17 million. I 
can’t write a check for $17 million. I 
don’t know anybody here who can. The 
number of donors who can write a 
check for $17 million is very small, and 
the number who would want to is even 
smaller. That is another avenue of in-
fluence. 
Last, you have law groups appearing 
before the U.S. Supreme Court, also 
anonymously funded. Some have gone 
out to find a plaintiff of convenience to

October 24, 2020 
bring strategic litigation before the 
Court. Some appear as what they call 
amici curiae, friends of the Court. 
Some swap back and forth in the same 
series of cases; they exchange positions 
as the litigant group and a friend of the 
Court. But what they share is that 
they are funded by the same groups, 
and they don’t disclose that to the 
Court in their filings. So it raises the 
proposition that this isn’t just dark- 
money eels swirling around the Court, 
but these are, in fact, tentacles of a 
common operation. 
It is particularly surprising that the 
Senator from Montana would not have 
concern about this because the State of 
Montana has been so strongly con-
cerned about dark-money influence for 
so long. Indeed, it was a State of Mon-
tana case that went to the Supreme 
Court under, I guess, Attorney General 
Bullock at the time, where Senator 
McCain and I wrote a bipartisan brief 
warning of the dangers of all of this 
money. 
So that is the first thing—dark- 
money influencers swirling around the 
Court in a way that is unprecedented, 
in my view, in judicial history. 
The second is a pattern of decisions 
that has emerged out of that Court. 
Under Chief Justice Roberts, there 
have been 80 decisions that had these 
characteristics: One, they were decided 
5 to 4—a bare majority. Courts usually 
strive to build stronger majorities be-
cause that strengthens the institution. 
Eighty cases, bare 5-to-4 majorities—by 
the way, bare partisan 5-to-4 majori-
ties—and in every case, an identifiable 
Republican donor interest at stake 
that won—a pattern of 80 to 0. 
Last, you have the behavior taking 
place politically around these nomina-
tions and how peculiar that behavior 
is. 
Here is Senator DAINES talking about 
the effort to appoint Judge Garland to 
the Supreme Court. He said, ‘‘I don’t 
think it’s right.’’ The Senator put it in 
terms of right and wrong. And he said, 
‘‘I don’t think it’s right to bring a 
nominee forward in an election year.’’ 
He said, ‘‘The American people have al-
ready begun voting . . . and their voice 
should be reflected in what we do going 
forward.’’ 
The very next occasion, the very next 
election in which the same set of cir-
cumstances presented itself, he and vir-
tually everyone on the Republican side 
completely 
reversed 
their 
position 
about what is right in this matter. 
When you see reversals of position like 
that, that is a signal to me that there 
is something more going on. 
So whether it is all the dark money, 
whether it is the peculiar pattern of de-
cisions, 
or 
whether 
it 
is 
the 
unexplainable behavior of Members, it 
sends a pretty strong signal that some-
thing is, in fact, rotten in and around 
that Court. 
I believe that every one of us should 
agree that we are entitled as Ameri-
cans to a court that is not a panto-
mime court that goes through the rou-
tine, the ritual of adjudication, while 
making sure that a small group of spe-
cial interests actually wins the case at 
the end of the day. Nobody should be 
interested in a court that operates that 
way. 
We don’t know how bad the situation 
is because it is dark money, because it 
is still hidden, and until we figure it 
out, under the rule that it is premature 
to rule out remedies until you have a 
complete diagnosis, I will object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. I appreciate the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island bringing up 
dark money spent in our elections. 
We all agree that dark-money spend-
ing has gotten out of control; however, 
the Senator from Rhode Island gives 
me an opportunity to point out the bla-
tant hypocrisy from those in the 
Democratic Party on this very issue. 
I know I speak for probably every 
Montanan, if not most, when I say that 
we are tired of being bombarded with 
never-ending television, digital, radio, 
mail pieces, and most of it is from 
dark-money organizations. And where 
do you think much of this dark money 
is coming from? It is from groups 
aligned with the minority leader and 
the Democrats. In fact, according to a 
September 2020 report by OpenSecrets, 
which tracks political spending, two 
dark-money groups aligned with the 
Democratic Senate leadership have 
spent more than $44 million on polit-
ical TV ads—more than any other out-
side group on television ads during the 
2020 election cycle. 
Let me say that again. These are two 
dark money groups aligned with Demo-
cratic Senate leadership that have 
spent more than any other outside 
group on television ads during the 2020 
election cycle. Yet neither group has 
reported any spending to the FEC at 
all—zero. 
You may ask yourself why the mi-
nority leader and his dark money allies 
are dumping so much money into races 
across our country, including Montana. 
The reason for that is the minority 
leader wants to be the majority leader 
and take control of the U.S. Senate. He 
wants to change the rules, destroy 151 
years of precedent, and pack the Su-
preme Court with activist, liberal 
judges who will strip away our rights 
and our freedom. 
Packing the Court is a direct attack 
on our Montana way of life. That is 
why, more than ever, my Court pack-
ing resolution is so important. It just 
says: Let’s keep it at nine. 
It is not that complicated. We cannot 
let this Court packing occur. 
So while the Democrats continue to 
decry dark money—until it benefits 
their campaigns, of course—we must 
all take a stand in ensuring that our 
Montana way of life is protected. 
For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I just want to 
make sure that the record of the Sen-
ate is clear here. Democrats don’t just 
decry dark money spending; Democrats 
have, over and over again, sought to 
end it. I know this because I was the 
floor leader on the DISCLOSE Act 
when we brought it right here in the 
Senate, and we came within one vote of 
getting rid of dark money. Every Dem-
ocrat voted for that measure. Every 
Democrat voted to get rid of this 
scourge of dark money. Every Repub-
lican voted to protect it. 
So, yes, do Democrats use dark 
money? We are playing by your rules. 
We are playing by Republican rules. We 
could have brought up the DISCLOSE 
Act again because it was the first order 
of business the House passed in H.R. 1, 
but the Senate majority leader didn’t 
want that bill to get a vote. 
So it is a little bit rich to hear a lit-
any of woes about dark money from 
the party that is responsible for dark 
money happening. We could have got-
ten rid of it if we had passed my DIS-
CLOSE Act. We could have gotten rid 
of it if we had passed H.R. 1. We did 
none of the above. 
So if I may, I would like to ask that 
a resolution be passed. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 59 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 59, submitted earlier today; fur-
ther, that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
If I may, just briefly, before the Pre-
siding Officer calls for objections, just 
describe the resolution, which ex-
presses the sense of the Senate that 
dark money undermines the integrity 
of the judicial system and damages the 
perception that all people receive equal 
justice under law; that dark money or-
ganizations funded by anonymous do-
nors are now playing an outsized role 
in the selection of judges and Justices 
of the Supreme Court of the United 
States and have spent millions of anon-
ymous dollars on advertising cam-
paigns 
supporting 
those 
selections; 
that the people of the United States 
have no idea who is funding these cam-
paigns and what business those funders 
might have before the Court; that the 
Federalist Society and the Judicial 
Crisis Network and other groups have 
been a part of this and they are heavily 
dark money funded in this role; that 
then-Candidate Trump said of his judi-
cial selections that they would ‘‘be 
hand-picked by the Federalist Soci-
ety’’; that his White House counsel 
boasted that the Federalist Society 
had been ‘‘in-sourced’’; that the Wash-
ington Post reported that Leonard Leo, 
then of the Federalist Society, helped 
raise $250 million from mostly anony-
mous donors into this effort—and I will 
leave the rest of the details to inter-
ested readers who want to pursue it. 
But I would say to Senator DAINES’ 
umbrage about dark money in Montana 
campaigns, if there is anything worse

than dark money in political cam-
paigns, it is dark money around courts, 
and that is the problem we face right 
now, and that is what requires looking 
into. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I have already 
made my remarks about the hypocrisy 
on this issue of dark money. 
I think it is also worth pointing out 
that it was a very different situation in 
2016, when Merrick Garland was nomi-
nated by President Obama. In every 
White House controlled by one party 
and the U.S. Senate by another, the 
President of the Senate, going back to 
1888—in an election year when both the 
Senate and the Presidency are con-
trolled by the same party, you move 
forward; when not, you don’t. 
That is exactly what we did. We had 
an election in 2016. President Trump 
won, and here we are in 2020 with Re-
publicans controlling the Senate, and 
the White House began to move for-
ward. 
So with that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
would just add, that was not what Sen-
ator DAINES or anybody else on the Re-
publican side said at the time. I was 
here at the time, and what was said at 
the 
time, 
particularly 
by 
Senator 
DAINES is ‘‘I don’t think it’s right to 
bring a nominee forward in an election 
year’’—not when the party’s control is 
split in one way or another. ‘‘I don’t 
think it’s right to bring a nominee for-
ward in an election year’’ because the 
American people should have their 
voice ‘‘reflected.’’ 
That has not changed. This new em-
phasis on the party difference is fun-
damentally the rule of ‘‘because we 
can.’’ If that is going to be the rule, if 
that is the rule that Republicans are 
prepared to adopt here—that what 
matters around here isn’t precedent, 
isn’t principle, isn’t what is right, but 
is just because we can—then please 
don’t feign surprise in the months and 
years ahead if we on the Democratic 
side follow that same rule that you are 
saying is the way to proceed today. 
In the same way that it is at least 
ironic for Republicans to stand here 
complaining about dark money when it 
was the Republican Party that pro-
tected dark money here on the Senate 
floor, it will be equally ironic if the 
party should turn around later on and 
Democrats seek to use the measure of 
‘‘because we can,’’ and you raise objec-
tions. You are basically here on the 
Senate floor forfeiting your right to 
make those objections in the way you 
are behaving on this nomination. 
With that, I will yield the floor to 
Senator SCOTT. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
DAINES). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
given the time, I will reserve the other 
unanimous consents I have. I under-
stand that we are going to close, and 
we are close to that time. So I appre-
ciate Senator SCOTT’s coming to the 
floor to respond to those, but I yield 
back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
will shortly ask to have a quorum call 
by noting the absence of a quorum, but 
before I do that, I wanted to point out 
just one issue of vocabulary, if you 
will, which is that the definition of 
‘‘court packing’’ has actually two oper-
ative definitions on the Senate floor: 
One is to expand the number of judges; 
the other is to take advantage of exist-
ing vacancies and try to use them to 
change the balance of the courts and to 
put in judges who are predisposed to 
certain rulings. 
That is, in fact, the meaning that 
Senator MCCONNELL gave to that term 
when he said that President Obama 
was seeking ‘‘to pack the D.C. Circuit 
with appointees’’ when he was filling 
vacancies; that Senator CORNYN used 
when he said President Obama wanted 
to ‘‘pack the D.C. Circuit’’; what Sen-
ator GRASSLEY
used when he an-
nounced President Obama’s ‘‘efforts to 
pack’’ the D.C. Circuit; and when Sen-
ator LEE of Utah accused President 
Obama of trying to ‘‘pack the D.C. Cir-
cuit with unneeded judges simply in 
order to advance a partisan agenda.’’ 
So when we describe all that has 
taken place across the last three nomi-
nations—all the procedural abnormali-
ties, all the peculiarities of funding, all 
the odd political behavior on the other 
side, the 180-degree, tire-squealing re-
versals, all of that, we are actually fol-
lowing the vocabulary that you all 
used about the D.C. Circuit, just to be 
clear on that point. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
758—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT THE NUMBER OF 
JUSTICES 
OF 
THE 
SUPREME 
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
SHOULD REMAIN AT 9 
Mr. DAINES submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 758 
Whereas the Act entitled An Act to amend 
the judicial system of the United States, ap-
proved April 10, 1869 (commonly known as 
the ‘‘Judiciary Act of 1869’’) (16 Stat. 44; 
chapter 22), states that ‘‘the Supreme Court 
of the United States shall hereafter consist 
of the Chief Justice of the United States and 
eight associate justices’’; 
Where the Supreme Court of the United 
States has consisted of a Chief Justice and 8 
associate Justices for 151 years; 
Whereas previous attempts to increase the 
number of justices on the Supreme Court of 
the United States have been rejected and 
widely condemned by individuals of both po-
litical parties; 
Whereas, in 1937, when former President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the Ju-
dicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, a bill 
that sought to expand the number of justices 
on the Supreme Court of the United States 
from 9 justices to 15 Justices, he was harshly 
criticized by both parties and his own Vice 
President, John Nance Garner; 
Whereas, the 1937 Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee report, in response to the Court-pack-
ing plan by President Roosevelt, decried the 
plan as ‘‘a needless, futile, and utterly dan-
gerous abandonment of constitutional prin-
ciple’’, that ‘‘[i]ts ultimate operation would 
be to make this government one of men rath-
er than one of law’’ and that it was ‘‘a meas-
ure, which should be so emphatically re-
jected that its parallel will never again be 
presented to the free representatives of the 
free people of America’’; 
Whereas, during the Trump Administra-
tion, Democrats have refused to recognize 
the legitimacy of nominations made by 
President Trump to the Supreme Court of 
the United States and have advocated for 
packing the Court with additional justices 
appointed by a future Democrat president; 
Whereas, in 1983 during a Senate Judiciary 
Committee hearing, then-Senator Joe Biden 
noted that Court packing was a ‘‘bonehead 
idea’’ and ‘‘a terrible, terrible mistake’’ that 
‘‘put in question for an entire decade the 
independence of the most significant body— 
including the Congress, in my view—the 
most significant body in this country, the

ica’’; 
Whereas, in 2005 during a speech on the 
Senate floor, then-Senator Joe Biden praised 
members of the Democrat Party for their 
‘‘act of courage’’ in opposing the Court-pack-
ing plan of President Roosevelt, which he de-
scribed as a ‘‘power grab’’; 
Whereas, in 2019, the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg stated, ‘‘I think it was a bad 
idea when President Franklin Roosevelt 
tried to pack the Court’’, and that ‘‘if any-
thing would make the Court look partisan, it 
would be that’’; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States is based on the principle of separation 
of powers to provide for checks and balances 
on each branch of the Federal Government 
and expanding the Supreme Court of the 
United States purely for political advantage 
threatens the separation of powers and the 
system of checks and balances established in 
the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the Federal judiciary is insulated 
from political influence through lifetime ap-
pointments and other measures to preserve 
its independence and an attempt to expand 
the Supreme Court of the United States 
purely for political purposes threatens the 
independence and integrity of the Supreme 
Court and, thus, the entirety of the judiciary 
it oversees; and 
Whereas any attempt to increase the num-
ber of justices of the Supreme Court of the 
United States or ‘‘pack the Court’’ would un-
dermine the democratic institutions and de-
stroy the credibility of the highest court in 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate opposes any at-
tempt to increase the number of justices of 
the Supreme Court of the United States or 
otherwise pack the Court.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
759—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT DARK MONEY UN-
DERMINES THE INTEGRITY OF 
THE 
JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM 
AND 
DAMAGES 
THE 
PERCEPTION 
THAT 
ALL 
PEOPLE 
RECEIVE 
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 759 
Whereas dark money organizations, funded 
by anonymous donors, have played an out-
sized role in the selection of judges and jus-
tices of the Supreme Court of the United 
States (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Supreme Court’’) under President Trump 
and spent millions of anonymous dollars on 
advertising campaigns supporting those se-
lections; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have no idea who is funding these campaigns 
and what business the funders might have 
before the courts; 
Whereas, under President Trump, the Fed-
eralist Society for Law and Public Policy 
Studies (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Federalist Society’’) has played a central 
role in the selection of President Trump’s ju-
dicial nominees, including his 3 nominees to 
the Supreme Court, for example— 
(1) in 2016, then-candidate Trump said that 
all of his judicial selections would ‘‘be hand- 
picked by the Federalist Society’’; 
(2) in 2017, then-White House Counsel Don 
McGahn boasted that the judicial selection 
process had been ‘‘in-sourced’’ to the Fed-
eralist Society; 
(3) Leonard Leo, the Co-Chairman of the 
Federalist Society, twice took a leave of ab-
sence from the Federalist Society to work in 
the White House and advise President Trump 
on his Supreme Court nominations; 
(4) approximately 86 percent of President 
Trump’s Supreme Court and appellate court 
nominees have been members of the Fed-
eralist Society; and 
(5) Judge Amy Coney Barret has spoken at 
26 Federalist Society events since 2014 and, 
at the time of his confirmation in 2018, Jus-
tice Brett Kavanaugh had spoken at over 50 
Federalist Society events; 
Whereas the Washington Post reported 
that Leonard Leo has helped raise $250,000,000 
from mostly anonymous donors to promote 
conservative legal causes and judges; 
Whereas groups engaged in these activities 
do not disclose their funders, meaning the 
people of the United States have no idea who 
is behind this sophisticated operation to in-
fluence the selection of judges and justices; 
Whereas dark money groups like the Judi-
cial Crisis Network (referred to in the pre-
amble as ‘‘JCN’’) have helped shape the com-
position of the Supreme Court by spending 
tens of millions of anonymous dollars on ad-
vertising campaigns opposing or supporting 
Supreme Court nominees, specifically— 
(1) JCN spent $7,000,000 to block President 
Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Gar-
land to be an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court in 2016; 
(2) JCN pledged to spend $10,000,000 to sup-
port President Trump’s nomination of then- 
Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court in 2017; 
(3) JCN also spent $10,000,000 to support 
President Trump’s nomination of then-Judge 
Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court in 2018; and 
(4) JCN has pledged to spend $10,000,000 to 
support President Trump’s nomination of 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an Associate 
Justice of the Supreme Court; 
Whereas JCN is a dark money organization 
and does not disclose its funders to the peo-
ple of the United States; 
Whereas JCN has received multiple mas-
sive contributions from the anonymous do-
nors, specifically— 
(1) a $15,881,000 anonymous contribution in 
tax year 2018; 
(2) a $17,100,000 anonymous contribution in 
tax year 2017; 
(3) a $21,464,995 anonymous contribution in 
tax year 2016; and 
(4) a $17,920,000 anonymous contribution in 
tax year 2015; and 
Whereas the American people have no idea 
who made these massive contributions and 
what business the contributors might have 
before the courts: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) fair and impartial courts are a bedrock 
of American democracy and crucial to main-
taining the faith of the people of the United 
States in the justice system; 
(2) this massive dark money operation to 
influence the selection and confirmation of 
judges and justices creates significant con-
flict of interest concerns for the judiciary 
and undermines the integrity of the courts 
and the justice system; and 
(3) the people of the United States deserve 
to know who is behind this massive dark 
money campaign to capture the courts.
