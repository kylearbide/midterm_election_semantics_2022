PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our God, You are our refuge 
and our shield, our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come. And yet, 
day after day, we lean on our own un-
derstanding to sort out the confusion 
of our lives and the uncertainty that 
attempts to overwhelm us. 
Sustain us, O God, according to Your 
promise, that we would know how You 
would have us live into this turmoil. In 
You, may we find our purpose. 
O Lord, our God, You are our refuge 
and our shield, our help in ages past, 
and our hope for years to come. But 
today, we stand rattled by the up-
heaval of things believed in, time in-
vested, sacrifices made. Nothing seems 
trustworthy, years seem wasted, losses 
in vain. 
Sustain us, O God, according to Your 
promise, that we would know how You 
would have us live into this grief. In 
You may we find our purpose. 
O Lord, our God, You are our refuge 
and our shield, our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come. Lift up our 
eyes to Your saving power. Transform 
our vain efforts into building blocks for 
change. Uphold us in our weakness that 
our frailty would reveal Your mercy. 
Sustain us, O God, according to Your 
promise, that we would know how You 
would have us live into Your strength. 
In You may we find our purpose. 
O Lord, our God, our refuge, our 
shield, our help, our hope, sustain us 
that in You we will live and find our 
purpose. 
We offer these prayers in Your most 
gracious name. 
Amen.

HONORING DON GRUNEISEN FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
PRESTIGIOUS 
BETSY KAPLAN AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Don Gruneisen for receiving 
the prestigious Betsy Kaplan Award from the 
St. Lawrence County Republican Committee. 
Mr. Gruneisen has been a dedicated com-
munity leader in St. Lawrence County for dec-
ades. Since he first became active in local pol-
itics in the 1980s, he has been a consistent 
voice for the members of his community and 
the causes that he believes in. Today, he 
serves as the St. Lawrence County Repub-
lican Committee Treasurer, a Regional GOP 
Chairman, and as the Potsdam Republican 
Town Chair. 
The Betsy Kaplan Award, named after a 
former St. Lawrence County Republican Com-
mittee Chairperson, is given by the St. Law-
rence County Republican Executive Com-
mittee to Republicans who go above and be-
yond to serve their North Country community. 
Based on Mr. Gruneisen’s decades of activism 
and service, he is undoubtedly deserving of 
this recognition. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
District, I thank Mr. Gruneisen for his service 
to the North Country and congratulate him on 
receiving this award. 
f 
HONORING THE CAREER AND AC-
COMPLISHMENTS OF TOM FLO-
RES 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Tom Flores for his out-
standing professional football career and his 
induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
Tom Flores, born in Fresno and raised in 
Sanger, California, was inducted to the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame on August 8, 2021. After 
playing as quarterback for Fresno City College 
and then University of the Pacific, Flores 
began his professional career with the Calgary 
Stampeders of Canadian Football League. Al-
though he would be cut in 1958 and cut from 
the Washington Redskins of the National Foot-
ball League (NFL) in 1959, Flores won the 
starting quarterback position with the Amer-
ican Football League’s Oakland Raiders in 
1960. 
During his career, Flores also played for the 
Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, win-
ning his first Super Bowl as quarterback with 
the latter in 1969. Following his retirement, 
Flores worked as an assistant coach with the 
Buffalo Bills and Oakland Raiders, later being 
named head coach for the Raiders in 1979 
and leading the team to Super Bowl victories 
in 1980 and 1983. 
After working as the President and General 
Manager of the Seattle Seahawks, Flores 
went on to lead the Seahawks as head coach 
for three seasons before spending over 20 
years as a radio analyst with the Raiders. 
Despite his incredible success, Flores never 
forget his roots. His foundation, the Tom Flo-
res Foundation, raised nearly 2 million dollars 
for Sanger Unified School District art, science, 
and athletic programs. In addition to being the 
first Hispanic quarterback in the American pro-
fessional football, Flores is also the first His-
panic head coach in NFL history. The son of 
immigrants, he is an inspiration to countless 
young athletes in the Central Valley and all 
over the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating Tom Flores and honoring his con-
tributions to the NFL and the Central Valley.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
WASHINGTON COUNTY DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY EUGENE ‘‘GENE’’ A. 
VITTONE II 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to remember the life of Washington Coun-
ty District Attorney (DA) Eugene ‘‘Gene’’ A. 
Vittone, II, who passed away on August 21st, 
2021 at the age of 61. 
A Washington County, Pennsylvania native, 
Gene Vittone grew up in Monongahela and 
graduated from Peters Township High School 
in 1977. He earned a degree in biological 
science, graduating from the University of 
Pittsburgh (Pitt) in 1981. Gene later returned 
to Pitt to earn a master’s degree in health ad-
ministration and business administration. 
Following graduation, Gene felt the call to 
help others and became a paramedic, later 
helping manage Ambulance and Chair EMS in 
Washington. Gene attended Duquesne Univer-
sity’s law program, while still serving as a 
paramedic, and graduated in 1997. He main-
tained his paramedic certification for the rest 
of his life. 
Gene started in the Washington County 
DA’s office as an assistant DA in 1998. While 
there, he handled juvenile court and several 
trial lists and covered felony criminal trials. 
Gene also developed the Drug Treatment 
Court for the county. 
In 2011, Gene was elected top prosecutor 
and began his term as the opioid crisis was 
unfolding in Pennsylvania and across the na-
tion. As co-chair of the Opioid Overdose Coali-
tion, he was adamant that law enforcement 
could not, ‘‘arrest their way out of’’ the opioid 
epidemic. Gene focused on treatment for 
users while aggressively pursuing dealers, of-
tentimes working across the aisle or with the 
federal government. He was instrumental in 
bringing lifesaving Narcan to Washington 
County and pioneered the establishment of 
prescription drop-off boxes. 
Gene was one of the first DAs in the area 
to introduce a full-time victim advocate to work 
alongside attorneys on domestic abuse cases. 
He was also committed to addressing elder 
abuse and served on the Pennsylvania Su-
preme Court’s Elder Law Task Force. His care 
for others fueled his incredible work ethic, and 
he continued to work throughout his battle with 
lung cancer. A testament to how much his 
peers respected him, Gene was elected presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys As-
sociation in July 2021. 
Gene was a committed community member, 
father, and husband. He was an assistant 
Scout Leader for Troop 1419 in Bentleyville 
and coached baseball for the Bentworth Base-
ball Association. Gene sang with Washington 
Festival Chorale and his parish choir. He is 
survived by his wife, Jane Ann Vittone, and 
his two children, Michael and Laura. 
Madam Speaker, even in his last days, 
Gene Vittone lived his life in service to others. 
He will always be remembered for the count-
less lives he saved in his fight against the rav-
ages of the opioid crisis. I have no doubt that 
his incredible legacy will live on in Washington 
County and across the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.

RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE

NATIONAL 
HISTORICALLY 
BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVER-
SITIES 
(HBCU) 
CONFERENCE 
WEEK 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduced a Resolution to recognize National 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCU) Conference Week. 
HBCUs are an integral part of our society— 
academically, socially, and economically. Rec-
ognizing the value of HBCUs is vital as we 
continue to look forward to a more equitable 
society for all. 
To that end, this Resolution provides a brief 
historical overview of HBCUs and how they 
came to be, and reaffirms our collective com-
mitment to support the students of these col-
leges and universities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E948 
September 3, 2021 
his retirement this month after a career of 
more than thirty years as a distinguished Mas-
ter Cabinet Maker for the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. We depend so greatly on the tal-
ented carpentry staff to ensure that House of-
fices are properly equipped to perform the 
people’s work, and I want to thank all of those 
employees, like Chris, who are working hard 
to restore, maintain, and upgrade the fur-
nishings of this historic building of more than 
two centuries. 
Chris aspired to be a woodworker from a 
young age, and he attended the St. Mary’s 
County Technical Center, now called the Dr. 
James A. Forrest Career and Technology 
Center. After working on his family’s tobacco 
farm and in several other jobs, including 
house-building, Chris applied for a job opening 
in the House cabinet shop. His father had 
worked for the Congress before serving in the 
U.S. military, and his mother, also previously 
in Congressional employment, drove him to 
the interview. Indeed, Chris grew up in a 
home steeped in public service and love of 
country. 
Impressing the manager with the breadth of 
his woodworking knowledge and his hands-on 
skills, Chris was hired on the spot, and he 
began serving as an Apprentice Cabinet 
Maker. He started out running service calls 
and soon advanced to the position of Journey-
man. Chris honed his skills on the job under 
the tutelage of his former Managers—Art 
Baltrym, Peter Shipman, and Anthony Thomp-
son—all distinguished furniture makers. One 
of his most memorable tasks included rede-
signing the furnishings in the historic office 
used by Rep. JAMES CLYBURN, now the Demo-
cratic Whip. This included constructing a cus-
tom desk, glass cabinets, and a matching cre-
denza, all still in use today. The cabinet shop 
was often called to perform other tasks in the 
historic Hall of the House, and Chris and his 
co-workers spent many hours refurbishing the 
seats on the House Floor and installing safety 
measures to protect Members in the years 
after the 9/11 attacks. He also worked on the 
Floor of the House and on the Speaker’s dais 
and podium. 
Chris has been the cabinet shop’s Design 
Specialist for over ten years and has been re-
sponsible for designing every piece of con-
structed furniture during that time. He is con-
sidered an exceptionally valuable Master of 
the Trade. When reflecting on his achieve-
ments, Chris has cited countless committee- 
room renovations and his involvement in com-
pleting the equipment consoles on the daises 
in each of the House’s committee rooms. 
Chris was here twenty years ago during the 
tragic 9/11 attacks and the evacuation of the 
Capitol complex. He was at work when an 
earthquake struck the District of Columbia, ten 
years ago, causing structural damage and 
cracks to the Capitol Building. Chris was also 
on campus during the fatal shootings of U.S. 
Capitol Police Detective John Gibson and Offi-
cer Jacob Chestnut on July 24, 1998, as well 
as, earlier this year, during the attack on the 
Capitol on January 6, when he and so many 
others had to shelter in place. Like so many 
others serving in House employment, Chris 
has been a firsthand witness to history and to 
the challenges and threats facing the Capitol 
and all who work here. 
During the COVID pandemic, Chris has 
taken a lead role in the shop. He has contin-
ued to demonstrate high standards with re-
spect to building and design, and he has been 
assigning work, answering calls, attending 
meetings, and handling shop attendance dur-
ing these trying times and while working to 
protect the health and safety of his co-work-
ers. I continue to express my admiration for all 
of those, like Chris and his colleagues, who 
are working here during the pandemic to keep 
Congress operating and to help Members per-
form their jobs for the American people. 
Chris is retiring after an illustrious career in 
House employment, and I am told that he 
plans to spend more time pursuing his pas-
sions of fishing, hunting and drag racing while 
continuing to work part-time in electrical and 
woodworking. I hope all of my colleagues will 
join me in extending congratulations to Chris 
Martin for his many years of dedication, su-
perb craftsmanship, and outstanding contribu-
tions to the U.S. House of Representatives, 
many of which we literally sit in today on this 
Floor. I join in wishing him a very enjoyable 
retirement and thank him for all of his hard 
work in service to this House and to our coun-
try.

HONORING TOM BURKE FOR HIS 
SERVICE TO THE KERN COMMU-
NITY COLLEGE DISTRICT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Tom Burke for his exemplary 
leadership in serving the residents of Kern and 
Tulare County for 20 years in his role as the 
Kern Community College District (KCCD) 
Chief Financial Officer and Chancellor. 
Tom graduated from California Polytechnic 
State University, San Luis Obispo in 1981, 
and has lived in Bakersfield, California since. 
Before working for the KCCD, Tom was em-
ployed by the Getty Oil Company from 1981 to 
1985 and earned his master’s degree from 
California State University, Bakersfield shortly 
thereafter. He moved on to work for Contel, a 
telecommunications company, until joining Ba-
kersfield College in 1997 as the Director of 
Business Services. In 2001, Tom was tapped 
to be the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the 
KCCD, beginning a long career serving com-
munity colleges in the Kern and Tulare coun-
ties. When Tom first took over as CFO, the 
district’s finances were shaky and the fiscal re-
serve was only at 5% of its annual operating 
budget, making the district vulnerable to finan-
cial difficulties. As of this past year, the dis-
trict’s reserve is about 50% of its annual oper-
ating budget, making it one of the healthiest in 
the State of California. The turnaround is a 
testament to Tom’s leadership and commit-
ment to our community. 
In 2017, Tom was appointed Chancellor of 
the KCCD, a widely supported move that was 
also endorsed by the Bakersfield College Stu-
dent Government Association, who called him 
a ‘‘champion for student voice and concerns.’’ 
While Tom retired from his role in July of this 
past year, his mark on the Kem Community 
College District will undoubtedly endure. As 
Chancellor, Tom oversaw Bakersfield College, 
Cerro Coso College, and Porterville College. 
His deep understanding of student’s needs 
and higher education allowed the district to in-
crease its enrollment and seamlessly transition 
to virtual learning during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Tom played a significant role in overseeing 
the management of the district’s water-ap-
proved bond monies, which aimed to fund new 
construction projects throughout the KCCD, 
such as the Bakersfield College Vernon 
Valenzuela Veteran Resource Center. Under 
his leadership, Bakersfield College saw its 
largest graduating class in history, and the dis-
trict’s three schools were among California’s 
community colleges that were least affected 
by the pandemic in terms of enrollment. 
Throughout his 20-year tenure with the dis-
trict, Tom devoted himself to improving com-
munity education and serving others. He has 
worked to ensure that all students are pro-
vided with the resources and services that are 
fundamental to an effective education, and in 
doing so, Tom has established himself as an 
educational standard and community leader of 
utmost integrity, generosity, and competency. I 
am grateful for Tom’s friendship and the serv-
ice he has provided for the Kem and Tulare 
communities. On behalf of the 23rd Congres-
sional District of California, I wish Tom and his 
wife, Tina, the best as he embarks on this 
next chapter in his life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
WILEY GAINEY, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of James ‘‘Jim’’ Wiley Gainey, 
Jr., who passed away on Friday, August 27, 
2021, at the age of 85. Jim was a longtime 
resident of Tyler County, and deeply re-
spected by all who knew him. 
Jim was born on July 19, 1936, in Houston, 
Texas to Evelyn and James Gainey. He was 
a U.S. Air Force serviceman stationed at 
Ellington Air Force Base in Houston when he 
and Lynette married. In 1964, they moved to 
Woodville and Jim went to work for his father- 
in-law, Leroy Davis, at Western Auto. Lynette 
and Jim were blessed with two daughters, 
Laura and Susan. 
Jim served on numerous boards including 
but not limited to: serving as Past President of 
the Tyler County Chamber of Commerce; Past 
President of The Woodville Rotary Club; and 
a member of the Board of Trustees of The 
Woodville Independent School District. Jim 
was the recipient of the James E. Wheat 
Award which recognizes truly exceptional 
leaders. He unselfishly gave of his time and 
talents to the Tyler County Dogwood Festival, 
a festival that celebrates the traditions and 
beauty of East Texas. 
In 1978, Jim pursued a new vocation, stead-
fastly serving as an R.N. He worked in both 
nursing and administration at the Tyler County 
Hospital. Jim also worked part-time at Wood-
ville Health and Rehab which he felt was one 
of the most rewarding jobs he had ever had 
the privilege to perform. In 2020, he and Ly-
nette moved to Beaumont to be closer to fam-
ily.

HONORING 
THE 
25TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE GEORGIA FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLE GROWERS AS-
SOCIATION 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the Georgia 
Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, 
which celebrated its 25th anniversary in Au-
gust. Headquartered in my home district in La-
Grange, Georgia, the association has solidified 
itself as the premier resource for growers in 
an area that is essential to Georgia’s economy 
and prosperity. 
By providing services such as education 
programs to maximize production, marketing 
opportunities to increase profits, and disaster 
management tools to handle natural disasters 
and other crises affecting the industry, the 
Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Associa-
tion is without question a cornerstone of agri-
culture and a boon to specialty crop growers 
across the state. 
Throughout the pandemic, the association 
has instituted a multitude of innovative solu-
tions aimed toward helping its members and 
Georgia’s specialty crop growers. They have 
also worked diligently with national organiza-
tions and congressional offices to secure relief 
aid through the Coronavirus Food and Assist-
ance Program for those in need. 
As the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Grow-
ers Association rounds out 25 years, I look 
forward to a bright future of continued strength 
and advocacy, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating this association’s great ac-
complishments. 
HONORING SAMANTHA ROSANNE 
MACON’S 50TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Samantha Rosanne 
Macon of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, on the 
occasion of her 50th birthday. Her continued 
service to our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Mrs. Macon was born in Dearborn, Michi-
gan, to Rose Tripepi and Joseph Czapiewski. 
A graduate of Annapolis High School, she 
later attended Henry Ford College and East-
ern Michigan University, graduating with hon-
ors. Mrs. Macon holds a master’s degree in 
education and teaches at Simpson Middle 
School in Flat Rock, Michigan. In 2006, she 
married Dino Macon and together they have 
two dogs and a cat. 
When she is not in the classroom with her 
middle schoolers, Mrs. Macon continues to 
teach and serve her community. She can be 
found at the Eton Senior Center in Dearborn 
Heights, teaching seniors how to decorate 
cupcakes. She is also an active member of 
her church and volunteers there often. 
Mrs. Macon is known by friends and family 
as someone with a kind and generous heart, 
who is always there to help those in need. In 
her downtime, she enjoys hosting gatherings 
for friends and family, visiting the beach, bak-
ing, and traveling. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Samantha Rosanne 
Macon on her 50th birthday. I join with her 
family and friends in extending my best and 
warmest wishes to her on this special day. I 
am proud to honor her life, her accomplish-
ments, and her invaluable contributions to our 
community.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF KEVIN 
VAN BUSKIRK 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of an esteemed 
leader in Contra Costa County, Kevin Van 
Buskirk, and congratulate him on his retire-
ment from the Contra Costa Building & Con-
struction Trades Council and Sheet Metal 
Workers’ Local Union No. 104. 
Kevin was born in Pleasant Hill, California, 
to Joel and Deanna Van Buskirk. After grad-
uating in 1979, he became a Teamster and 
worked as a tire man in San Leandro. After 
his apprenticeship with Marelich Mechanical at 
the Chevron Campus, he became an official 
sheet metal worker. While working as a jour-
neyman, foreman, and general foreman, Kevin 
actively organized with Sheet Metal Workers’ 
Local Union No. 104 by attending meetings, 
events, union pickets, and protests. 
In November of 1995, Kevin was appointed 
as the union’s first full-time organizer. As an 
example of the important work he has done, 
his efforts to hold a particular non-union com-
pany accountable led to the involvement of the 
Santa Clara County District Attorney and the 
revelation of ongoing wage theft. In 2000, 
Kevin was elected Business Representative 
for Sheet Metal Workers’ Local Union No. 104. 
He also served as a delegate to the Contra 
Costa Building and Construction Trades Coun-
cil, as well as a delegate to the Contra Costa 
Central Labor Council. In 2007, Kevin became 
President of the Contra Costa Building & Con-
struction Trades Council and Vice President of 
the Contra Costa Central Labor Council. 
In these capacities, he has negotiated nu-
merous project labor agreements and has as-
sisted many young men and women, as well 
as our returning veterans, into the trades. 
Kevin firmly believes that becoming a union-
ized tradesman has resulted in the success of 
his career and the ability to provide for his 
family. 
I wish Kevin well in his retirement and thank 
him for his enduring commitment to the rights 
of all workers. Please join me in honoring 
Kevin Van Buskirk for his many contributions 
to our community.

HONORING 
ROBERT 
AND 
DIANE 
FINDLAY AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Diane and Robert Findlay as 
Iowans of the Week. 
Every day, people of all ages and back-
grounds read books for different reasons. 
Some read books to spark their imagination, 
and others read books for more insight on fas-
cinating topics. For Diane and Robert Findlay, 
books are so much more than that. The Find-
lays started a book club in their community of 
Dallas Center, Iowa called Read & Serve. This 
group is not your average get-together to dis-
cuss the week’s literature. The Read & Serve 
book club is made up of members of different 
faiths, like Baha’is, Christians, and free think-
ers alike. While their faiths vary, they all share 
a common passion: community. Diane and 
Robert belong to the Baha’i faith, and they 
constantly look for opportunities to get in-
volved in their local community, specifically 
through prayer, learning, and serving with 
neighbors and friends. 
While the Read & Serve book club enjoys 
discussing their current readings, they also 
enjoy participating in service projects to further 
cultivate their collective sense of community. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic hit, the Find-
lay’s book club still wanted to find a project to 
get involved with that allowed them to give 
back, albeit in a safe manner. They heard of 
a project happening in New York where peo-
ple were donating their used books to local 
and county jails for the incarcerated individ-
uals to delve into. The Read & Serve book 
club connected with the Dallas County Sheriff 
and Dallas County Jail to see what they could 
do to get new books into the facility. 
The Findlay’s book club, with the help of the 
county jail, created a survey listing a multitude 
of genres to gauge the interest of the inmates. 
The survey showed they were interested in al-
most every genre imaginable. From westerns

to Shakespeare, thrillers to poetry, these indi-
viduals seemed eager to get their hands on 
the covers and their minds into the pages. 
Since the Findlays have started this project, 
they have been sending new copies of used 
books to the Dallas County Jail every third 
Tuesday each month. After the local news 
covered their story, more and more people 
from across their community, even across the 
country, contacted the Findlays stating their 
desire to contribute books. Even an author 
from Texas contributed signed copies of books 
they have published all because they were in-
spired by the Findlay’s story. 
Diane and Robert have felt the most re-
warding aspect of their project is seeing how 
much interest has been generated in their 
community and around the country. They have 
received many calls and emails expressing 
gratitude for their efforts to support a commu-
nity within our country that is often forgotten. 
Many of these calls and emails are accom-
panied by requests to send the Findlays more 
books, or even requests for instructions as to 
how others can start similar projects in their 
own communities. 
Books can make profound impacts on the 
lives of readers. Books inform us, captivate 
us, and allow us to grow through the stories 
and narratives laid out on the pages. I’m 
proud of the work constituents like Diane and 
Robert are doing, and I’m thrilled that their de-
sire to serve their community has made an im-
pact on communities across the Nation. I am 
honored to designate Diane and Robert Find-
lay as our Iowans of the Week.

HONORING MR. AL MAGGINI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Al Maggini 
in celebration of his 106th birthday on Sep-
tember 5, 2021. 
A third generation San Francisco native, Mr. 
Maggini has served both his country and com-
munity for all of his life. A few years after 
graduating from St. Ignatius College Pre-
paratory in 1933, Mr. Maggini enlisted in the 
Army Air Corps to serve his country. He be-
came a World War II B–17 Navigator who flew 
35 bombing missions over Germany and was 
widely acknowledged for his bravery. After the 
war, he returned to Sonoma County where he 
began work as a stockbroker. After moving to 
Santa Rosa, Mr. Maggini taught classes at the 
Santa Rosa Junior College for eleven years, 
and eventually served as a member of the 
College’s board of trustees for 34 years. Mr. 
Maggini worked late into his 90’s while con-
tinuing to volunteer for the community in nu-
merous ways. 
Mr. Maggini’s extensive history of commu-
nity service goes back as far as 1949. During 
this time, he was one of the founders of the 
Youth Baseball League of Sonoma Valley and 
was the first President of the Sonoma Valley 
Little League. In 1954, he became one of the 
leaders of the fundraise drive for the Santa 
Rosa Memorial Hospital’s first expansion cam-
paign and remained a foundation board mem-
ber and advisor. He is an active fundraiser for 
the Provident St. Joseph Memorial Founda-
tion, which raises funds to help support the 
needs of local hospitals. In addition, he has 
served as Chairman of the St. Joseph Memo-
rial Fund campaign, helping to raise $10 mil-
lion for the heart center. In recognition of Mr. 
Maggini’s service to Sonoma County, the 
Santa Rosa Junior College named Maggini 
Hall in his honor. 
Mr. Maggini has continuously dedicated his 
time to raising money for the Hanna Boys 
Center, along with serving on their Board of 
Directors. In recognition of his service, he was 
presented the 2018 Frank P. Doyle Award, 
which honors leaders in local business who go 
above and beyond in dedicating their time, en-
ergy, and resources to serving the needs of 
their community. In addition, Mr. Maggini is 
the oldest World War II veteran in Sonoma 
County, and among a handful of World War II 
Veterans in California. At 106, he remains an 
active public servant and is beloved by his 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Al 
Maggini is truly a model citizen and an exem-
plary civil servant. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

RECOGNIZING JACOB DAVIS 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. Jacob Davis, Jr., 
of Pierce County, Georgia, for his 100th birth-
day on October 6. 
A lifelong resident of Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District, Jacob has devoted his life 
to his community and country. 
He was drafted into the United States Navy 
in 1943 and was stationed in Great Lakes, Illi-
nois. He served as a fireman on an aircraft 
carrier that performed test flights for the mili-
tary. After being discharged from the military 
in December of 1945, Jacob returned to his 
family farm and married the love of his life, 
Jenny Henderson. 
Over Jacob’s lifetime of farming, he has ac-
cumulated over one thousand acres of farm-
land. To this day, he continues his work on his 
pecan orchard. If the sun is shining, Jacob 
can be found outside working. 
Although he has worked hard his entire life, 
Jacob was, and still is, a devoted and loving 
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. 
I am proud to rise today to recognize Ja-
cob’s birthday and his lifetime of service and 
leadership to Georgia’s First Congressional 
District.

TIREMENT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Steve Bowman on the occa-
sion of his retirement as the Veterans Serv-
ices Agency Director for Clinton County, New 
York. 
Steve has dedicated his life to the well- 
being of his country and his community. He 
served honorably in the United States Air 
Force for 18 years before retiring in 1994. In 
2004, Steve was appointed as the Director of 
Veterans Services Agency for Clinton County. 
In this role, he has worked tirelessly to support 
the veteran community, serving a staggering 
800 veterans a month on average. Throughout 
my time in Congress, Steve has been a vital 
resource, working closely with my office to as-
sist veterans throughout the North Country. 
In addition to his work as the Director of 
Veterans Services, he is a member of the 
American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
the Disabled American Veterans, and the 
North Country Veterans Association. Finally, 
on top of everything he has done for the Clin-
ton County veteran community, Steve and his 
wife Gail are also small business owners, op-
erating a family diner in Rouses Point. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to thank Steve and con-
gratulate him on reaching this important mile-
stone. His dedication to our North Country vet-
erans has left a significant impact on the com-
munity. I wish him all the best in this next 
chapter of his life.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF 
JAYNE M. ROTH’S RETIREMENT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Jayne M. Roth’s outstanding career. 
Jayne has been a 4–H Youth Development 
Program Educator with the Ohio State Univer-
sity Extension for forty years and has proven 
herself to be both a leader and a guide for

Jayne grew up on a farm in Wayne County 
near the town of Orrville in Northeast Ohio. 
She graduated from The Ohio State University 
in the spring of 1981 with a Bachelor of 
Science Degree in Animal Sciences. She also 
received a Master of Science Degree in Ani-
mal Production. Jayne began her career in

participants. In all aspects of her life, she finds 
joy in helping others succeed and dedicates

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF FREDDIE 
GOBLE 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Freddie Goble, a 
beloved Eastern Kentucky friend who recently 
retired after bringing laughter and joy to our 
Appalachian communities for the last 30 years 
through 
his 
comedic 
performances 
as 
‘‘Munroe.’’ 
Behind Munroe’s iconic star-spangled se-
quin vest, his bird-adorned ballcap and bright 
red shoes, is a multi-talented artist who found 
a home with the Kentucky Opry and the 
Mountain Arts Center (MAC) in Prestonsburg, 
Kentucky. In addition to serving as the house 
comedian, Freddie’s work behind the scenes 
brought the MAC to life. He wrote songs, 
mentored the Kentucky Opry Junior Pros, 
served as Assistant Director of the MAC, and 
became an ambassador for tourism and 
home-grown talent in Kentucky’s Appalachian 
region. In fact, he was one of the original 
champions for construction of the Mountain 
Arts Center, giving aspiring artists a stage of 
their own. 
Before discovering Munroe, Freddie Goble 
dedicated his career to transportation planning 
for the Kentucky Department of Highways and 
the Big Sandy region, working to make our 
roads safer in Eastern Kentucky. He is also a 
former city council member for the City of 
Prestonsburg and has volunteered his time for 
countless projects and organizations in the Big 
Sandy area. His love of Eastern Kentucky was 
clearly on display long before he ever stepped 
on stage at the Mountain Arts Center. 
As Freddie begins this new chapter of retire-
ment, I want to personally express my appre-
ciation for his work in our region and all the 
laughter that he shared with us over the years. 
I wish Freddie and his wife Beverly a retire-
ment filled with many years of happiness and 
rest with family and friends.

JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS 
ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with my strongest support of H.R. 4, the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 
2021. I’m very proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this legislation which restores critical 
protections to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
protecting the right to vote for all Americans. 
The disastrous Supreme Court decision of 
Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 gutted the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 by eliminating the 
requirement that certain states or jurisdictions 
with a history of segregation and voter sup-
pression preclear any changes to their election 
laws with the Justice Department. With 
preclearance no longer in place, dozens of ju-
risdictions across the country moved to restrict 
access to the ballot, especially for low-income 
voters and voters of color. The Supreme Court 
further gutted the Voting Rights Act in 
Brnovich v. DNC in 2021 by making it signifi-
cantly more difficult to challenge voting laws 
that deny or abridge the right to vote based on 
race, color, or language-minority status. 
Today, Americans face the worst voter sup-
pression efforts since the Jim Crow era. In 
2021, state lawmakers introduced over 400 
voter suppression bills in 49 states, and at 
least 18 states have enacted 30 laws that re-
strict access to the ballot. These laws sup-
press the right to vote by restricting access to 
mail-in and early voting; reducing the number 
and availability of polling places; and allowing 
arbitrary voter purges. It’s clear that voter sup-
pression efforts are not a relic of the past and 
that we must have strong federal laws in place 
to protect the fundamental right to vote. 
In my view, no legislation could be as im-
portant as this because the right to vote goes 
to the very core of our democracy. H.R. 4 was 
named in honor of the civil rights icon and late 
Member of Congress, John R. Lewis who 
dedicated his life to the sacred right to vote. 
This legislation continues John Lewis’ cher-
ished legacy and sends a clear message that 
will resound across our country that any ef-
forts to undermine the sacred right to vote will 
not be tolerated in our democracy. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this historic 
legislation because our democracy depends 
on it.

HONORING TWO ROSIE THE RIV-
ETERS IN GEORGIA’S 14TH DIS-
TRICT 
HON. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor two constituents in my 
district: Mary McJunkin, a Rome, Georgia na-
tive, who turned 100 years young on August 
30, 2021, and Louvenia ‘‘Lou’’ Jordan, who 
will turn 100 on May 27, 2022. I want to cele-
brate these extraordinary lives and note their 
contributions. 
First, I want to briefly highlight the great life 
of Mary McJunkin. Born in Rome, Georgia, on 
August 30, 1921, Mary McJunkin quit school 
to care for her younger siblings after her moth-
er’s death. Mary grew up working at a ten-cent 
store on Broad Street and went to the old 
Rome High School. During that time, and the 
rest of the time leading up to and during the 
war, everything was rationed. Ration stamps 
were used to buy certain things. 
When Mary was just 18, she married the 
love of her life, Guy McJunkin. Guy and Mary 
were together 69 years before he passed 
away. Mary and Guy had just gotten married 
when he was drafted into the Army after the 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. From there, 
he was moved to San Pedro, California at Fort 
McArthur. At first, Mary wasn’t going to follow 
him, but he called her one day and asked her 
to move to California. ‘‘I remember saying to 
him, ‘I haven’t ever been that far! I’ve been in 
Rome my entire life!’ ’’ 
It didn’t take long before Mary changed her 
mind and jumped on a Greyhound bus the 
very next day. She was 18 years old and trav-
eled all the way across the United States. It 
took five days and four nights to get there. 
‘‘When I got out to California after the long 
bus ride my husband, who guarded the coast-
line which was a target for the Japanese, had 
to pull guard duty that night and couldn’t come 
and pick me up,’’ said Mary. 
When Mary got off the bus, she didn’t have 
anywhere to go. Luckily, she found a woman 
who offered to help her, and she ended up 
staying at a Young Women’s Christian Asso-
ciation (YWCA) which is essentially a hostel or 
recreational facility for women in need. 
After that night, Guy and Mary found an 
apartment in Manhattan Beach, which is when 
Mary began her work at the El Segundo air-
plane factory. Mary worked third shift, so she 
had to take the Greyhound bus in order to go 
to work from Manhattan Beach to San Pedro/ 
El Segundo, which was about an hour ride 
both ways. She didn’t get any sleep! While at 
the airplane factory, Mary worked on an as-
sembly line that manufactured parts for planes 
that were used during World War II. She in-
jured her fingers working on the assembly line 
and received a new assignment operating a 
machine that pressed metal rings. 
Later, Mary followed her husband to military 
bases in Kentucky and Oklahoma, where she 
worked at a grocery store and dress shop, re-
spectively. Mary said she always had to find 
work because her husband only received $50 
per month from the Army. When her husband 
shipped out to Italy in 1944, Mary returned to 
Rome, Georgia. 
After the war, Mary’s husband worked as a 
sales representative for Advance Glove Mill, 
and Mary worked in the home and raised their 
daughters, Janie and Nancy. 
‘‘Becoming a Rosie has given me a lot of 
pride in what I chose to do back during the 
war,’’ said Mary. 
Approaching this centennial benchmark re-
cently passed by Mary, Louvenia ‘‘Lou’’ has 
filled her 99 years with much to celebrate and 
honor. 
Born May 27, 1922, Lou Jordan’s life began 
modestly on a farm in North Carolina where 
she and her seven siblings did chores from 
sun-up to sun-down. Her father passed on his 
mathematical skill to his children, all of whom 
earned scholarships to attend college. Lou se-
lected home economics as her major because 
‘‘at the time when I was young, there were 
only three professions for a woman: teacher, 
secretary, and nurse. Take your choice.’’ 
When Lou was in college, she had traveled 
home for Christmas when she learned about 
the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 
1941. When she made it back on campus, all 
the men had been put on trains as they were 
drafted for the war. 
Lou put her studies on hold and became a 
cryptographic analyst for the U.S. Army Signal 
Corps at Arlington Station in Arlington, Virginia 
when Army tests revealed that she had a 
technical mind perfect for codebreaking. She 
worked to break down and decipher decoded 
messages. ‘‘It was like doing algebra all day— 
finding the unknown.’’ Oftentimes, the mes-
sages were about where the troops were sta-
tioned or where they were being transferred. 
However, in one of the codes she helped 
crack, the group of cryptographers helped to 
save one small country in the Caribbean Sea. 
Lou had to have top security clearance. All 
the paper they figured on was burned and

then put on an airplane. The airplane would fly 
over the ocean and scatter the ashes. That is 
how secret her work was. 
On the day the war ended, everyone was 
out in the streets in Arlington. A streetcar was 
picked up by the military personnel and moved 
off to the side. They said, ‘‘This street belongs 
to the United States service’’ and everyone 
began dancing in the street. 
After the war, Lou married and returned to 
North Carolina where she worked as a book-
keeper for a local newspaper. She now lives 
near her daughter in Rome, Georgia, and 
counts her wartime service among the many 
ways in which she says: ‘‘we got women out 
of the kitchen.’’ 
I commend these lives of selfless service to 
our Nation and honor them in the U.S. House 
of Representatives.

HONORING 
ROBERT 
‘‘BOB’’ 
F. 
WEINHAGEN, JR. ON THE OCCA-
SION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM 
THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLA-
TIVE COUNSEL 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
my colleague, Mr. YARMUTH of Kentucky, and 
I would like to recognize the career of Bob 
Weinhagen, a senior counsel at the House Of-
fice of Legislative Counsel, upon his retire-
ment and thank him for his distinguished serv-
ice to the U.S. House Committee on the Budg-
et and Congress. 
Bob is retiring after 50 years of dedicated 
service to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Bob was hired as the fourteenth attorney to 
serve in the Office of the Legislative Counsel 
in July 1970. During his career, Bob drafted 
various banking laws, ethics reforms, and the 
Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. Bob 
worked closely with the House Committee on 
the Budget for most of his career, assisting 
Committee members and staff in fulfilling our 
responsibilities under the Congressional Budg-
et and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Bob 
played an invaluable role in drafting budget 
resolutions from 1981 through 2021 and all 
budget reconciliation bills since 1981. He also 
drafted countless budget laws, including the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Con-
trol Act of 1985, the Budget Enforcement Act 
of 1990, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 
2010, the Budget Control Act of 2011, and the 
Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013, 2015, 2018, 
and 2019. 
We greatly appreciate Bob’s dedication and 
exceptional service over the past 50 years to 
the House Committee on the Budget and Con-
gress. Bob exemplifies the Office of the Legis-
lative Counsel’s high standard of profes-
sionalism, expertise, and nonpartisanship. We 
wish him all the best in his retirement and fu-
ture endeavors. 
HONORING MARY REED 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mrs. Mary Reed, a distin-
guished member of the Columbus, Georgia, 
community, who recently celebrated her 100th 
birthday. 
Mary is part of the heartbeat of Columbus. 
Serving as the longtime Executive Secretary 
for the Rotary Club of Columbus, she prides 
herself on perfect attendance and leadership 
in helping others. 
She is an accomplished woman of God, a 
dedicated wife, mother, grandmother, and 
great-grandmother. Earlier this month, in 
honor and recognition of her impact in the 
community, Columbus Mayor Skip Henderson 
proclaimed Friday, August 25th, 2021, as 
Mary Reed Day, a fitting tribute. 
Madam Speaker, Mary Reed is a shining 
example of putting service above self, and our 
community is a better place thanks to her 
kindness and selflessness. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in wishing Mary a happy 
100th birthday and thank her for her many 
years of service to our community.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, MR. 
FRANK J. CHULAY 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor Frank J. Chulay and wish him a very 
happy 100th birthday on September 13, 2021. 
Mr. Chulay is a distinguished resident of 
Lincolnwood, Illinois. He had an honorable 
civic service career serving the Village of 
Lincolnwood and served as Village President 
from 1985 to 1993. 
Frank J. Chulay was born on September 13, 
1921. He immigrated to the US through Ellis 
Island at the age of 2 with his parents, Frank 
and Elizabeth, from the Hungarian part of Ro-
mania and moved to the City of Chicago. 
Mr. Chulay spent two years at Wright Junior 
College and attended Chicago Teacher’s Col-
lege, where he met Altanah, and they later 
married. He volunteered for a program in the 
Army Air Corps and was called up to active 
duty in 1943. Mr. Chulay was trained as a pilot 
and flew B–24 bombers in the South Pacific. 
He resigned from the military in 1945, at-
tended DePaul University under the GI Bill, 
and received a degree in accounting in 1946. 
In 
1967 
Frank 
and 
Altanah 
moved 
to 
Lincolnwood. 
Mr. Chulay served as Lincolnwood Village 
President from 1985 to 1993. He was instru-
mental in bringing Paramedic Services of Illi-
nois to Lincolnwood in 1989 and helped build 
the new Village Hall campus. During his term 
as Mayor, he cast the tiebreaking vote to ap-
prove the application to build the Lincolnwood 
Town Center. 
Mr. Chulay treated all he interacted with re-
spect and always put the needs of the Village 
residents first. He was active in the Northwest 
Municipal League, where he served as the 
President for one term, and active in the Na-
tional League of Cities. 
Mr. Chulay was married to Altanah for 48 
years before her death in 1992, and has two 
children, Jeff and Jill, two grandchildren, Kris-
tin and Amy, and one great-grandson, Mat-
thew. Frank has been married to Irma Chulay 
since 1995. 
I appreciate Mr. Chulay’s service to the 
Lincolnwood community and wish him a very 
happy 100th birthday.

RECOGNIZING HYDROCEPHALUS 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Hydrocephalus Awareness 
Month. Every September patients, caregivers, 
and their families come together throughout 
our Nation in support of the more than 
1,000,000 people of all ages living with hydro-
cephalus in the United States. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Pediatric 
and Adult Hydrocephalus Caucus, I believe 
Congress has an important role to play in both 
raising awareness of this condition, as well as 
in crafting policies that result in better treat-
ments and potentially a cure. I urge my col-
leagues to join the caucus to learn more about 
this devastating condition. In addition, I urge 
you to join Representative CHRIS SMITH and I 
in showing your support for this community by 
cosponsoring our resolution, H. Res. 20, which 
supports the goals and ideals of National Hy-
drocephalus Awareness Month. 
Anyone can develop hydrocephalus, an ab-
normal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in 
the brain, at any time. From children to vet-
erans, the breathtaking prevalence of this con-
dition is reflected in my own district. For exam-
ple, the physicians and staff at the Children’s 
Hospital of San Antonio perform the brain sur-
geries necessary to treat many of the one in 
770 babies across the country who develop 
hydrocephalus per year. Nationwide, these 
cases alone cost the U.S. health care system 
$2 billion per year. 
Veterans and active military personnel, such 
as those stationed at Joint Base San Antonio, 
are also disproportionally affected. Since 
2000, more than 370,000 U.S. service mem-
bers have sustained a traumatic brain injury, 
and it is estimated that 14 percent of those in-
dividuals with severe TBI—over 50,000 serv-
ice members—could develop hydrocephalus 
as a result. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and, 
more importantly, their constituents, by joining 
the 
Congressional 
Pediatric 
and 
Hydro-
cephalus Caucus and cosponsoring H. Res. 
20.

JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS 
ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of a measure on which I am a 
proud original cosponsor—H.R. 4, the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 
2021. Named for my friend and classmate 
from the 100th Congress, Congressman John 
Lewis, H.R. 4 honors America’s promise to 
keep our democracy open to all—regardless 
of gender, income, race, color, or creed. 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 are some of the most con-
sequential acts of Congress passed in our life-
time. The Voting Rights Act was a needed 
countermeasure to the voter suppression ef-
forts emanating across many states as a part 
of America’s ‘‘Jim Crow’’ era. 
The Voting Rights Act required preclearance 
of changes and adjustments made to voting 
laws by certain states and local jurisdiction— 
jurisdictions with long and demonstrated his-
tories of discrimination. The jurisdictions cap-
tured by the preclearance designation are said 
to be subject to the ‘‘coverage formula.’’ 
In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the 
‘‘coverage formula’’ of the Voting Rights Act in 
many respects. The Court’s rationale, with 
which I disagree, was the discrimination tar-
geted by the original Voting Rights Act is out-
dated and is no longer relevant. It’s a play on 
the notion of ‘‘my ancestors discriminated 
against you, not me’’ so there is no allowable 
remedy for that discrimination and its vestiges. 
The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act updates the coverage formula com-
ponent of the Voting Rights Act, using data, 
testimony, and evidence captured by the 
House Committee on Administration through 
various hearings and briefings. Over the 
course of 13 hearings in two Congresses, in-
cluding six just this year, the House Judiciary 
Committee built a substantial record dem-
onstrating the continuing and current need for 
preclearance 
protections. 
Additionally, 
the 
House Administration Committee’s Elections 
Subcommittee conducted numerous hearings 
and issued a report on ‘‘Voting In America: 
Ensuring Free And Fair Access To The Bal-
lot.’’ 
The combined record shows that in the ab-
sence of a preclearance requirement, a num-
ber of states swiftly passed voter suppression 
laws, including many state and local jurisdic-
tions that had previously been subject to 
preclearance before the 2013 Supreme Court 
decision. For example, within 24 hours of the 
ruling, Texas and North Carolina reinstated 
voter ID laws, which were later held to be in-
tentionally racially discriminatory. These court 
rulings, however, came too late for many mi-
nority voters. In both states, their discrimina-
tory laws were in effect for three years before 
being struck down, including during the 2014 
midterm elections. 
In short, without preclearance, these states 
were able to hold elections under discrimina-
tory rules that banned minority citizens’ ability 
to vote, and those citizens had no remedy for 
the harm they suffered. The onslaught of voter 
suppression targeting minority citizens has 
continued unabated. 
Today, Americans face the worst voter sup-
pression campaign in America since Jim 
Crow. State lawmakers have introduced over 
400 voter suppression bills in 49 states this 
year alone. And at least 18 states enacted 30 
laws that restrict access to the ballot, with like-
ly many more on the way. These laws sup-
press the vote—they make mail voting and 
early voting more difficult, reduce availability at 
polling places, unleash a flurry of faulty voter 
purges, and exacerbate barriers at poll sta-
tions for Americans with disabilities, among 
other blatant suppression tactics. 
Now, with H.R. 4, the House is restoring the 
preclearance protection with a new formula, 
which is ironclad constitutionally and which will 
make significant progress to restore the pur-
pose of the Voting Right Act: ‘‘banish the 
blight of racial discrimination in voting.’’ 
As Members of Congress, our duty lies in 
upholding our democracy and serving the 
American people. Our nation provides the op-
portunity for its people to amplify their voices 
at the ballot box. The United States Constitu-
tion allows us to correct any underlying issue 
that poses a threat to this fundamental right. 
I urge my colleagues to cast their vote in 
favor of this critical measure and to protect 
every citizen’s vote from the wave of voter 
suppression laws flooding our Nation. Ameri-
cans deserve nothing less than the ability to 
participate freely in our nation’s political proc-
ess.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
WHITE 
HOUSE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DI-
VERSITY ACT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, this year’s 
census result shows that the United States 
population is more ethnically diverse than be-
fore. There are many taxpayers whose first 
language is not English. 
Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, 
and French are among the most spoken lan-
guages in the United States. People benefit 
tremendously from having different options to 
access their government and receive informa-
tion that may impact their lives. This is why it 
is imperative that the White House and federal 
agencies continue to be accessible to all tax-
payers. 
Therefore, I am reintroducing the White 
House Accountability for Diversity Act. It is 
vital for all Americans to be able to follow 
issues that affect their lives. This legislation 
will allow for content to be translated into 
Spanish, 
Chinese, 
Tagalog, 
Vietnamese, 
French, and any other language deemed nec-
essary by the Office of Management and 
Budget. This will ensure that all taxpayers 
have the option of accessing up-to-date infor-
mation in their preferred language.

HONORING MR. ARMAND GARCIA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Brother Armand 
Garcia in celebration of his 90th birthday on 
Sunday, August 29. 
The 11th child of Ramon and Soledad Gar-
cia, Brother Armand was born and raised in 
East Los Angeles. After graduating from Los 
Angeles College High School, he entered the 
Christian Brothers Novitiate at Mont La Salle, 
where he strengthened his deep relationship 
with God. He graduated in 1957 with his bach-
elor’s in education from St. Mary’s College 
and went on to teach at Sacred Heart High 
School in San Francisco. He then spent three 
years as the Director at the St. Joseph Boys 
Boarding School, and in 1964, he was sent to 
the Philippines to work at Bacolod High 
School. 
After obtaining his master’s in linguistics 
from the University of Madrid in 1968, Brother 
Armand became the principal at La Salle High 
School in Bacolod, Philippines, where he con-
tinued to selflessly serve communities in need. 
He was later honored as The Adopted Son of 
Bacolod Occidental after being assigned to 
serve at De La Salle University and the East 
Asian Pastoral Institute in Manila. In 1977 
Brother Armand was sent to Tijuana, Mexico, 
where he created a successful volunteer- 
based school as well as the Centro La Salle 
Tijuana BC Foundation. This foundation grew 
into the Instituto Miguel-Hidalgo, Inc. Today, 
the foundation educates thousands of students 
in Tijuana, emulating the best of Christian 
Brothers’ educational achievements. 
It is evident that Brother Armand has been 
an incredible teacher, mentor, and leader 
throughout his life of service. He was both a 
board member and honoree of the Napa 
Peace Table and the founder of the Instituto 
Latino De Adultos Foundation, which helps 
Napa Latinos succeed in their careers. He is 
described as a master teacher, innovator, 
community leader, and compassionate spir-
itual guide in every community he has lived 
and worked in. Brother Armand is turning 90 
years old on Sunday, August 29th. He will be 
celebrating his birthday surrounded by family 
and friends at Mont La Salle in Napa. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt Brother 
Armand Garcia is truly a model citizen and an 
exemplary civil servant. Therefore, it is fitting 
and proper that we honor him here today.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF 
WAYLAND ROGERS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to my brother, 
Wayland Douglas Rogers, as we approach the 
first anniversary of his passing on September 
9, 2020. 
Wayland was a special addendum from 
Santa, making his familial debut on December 
26, 1941. We had a wonderful childhood, 
growing up in rural Wayne County, Kentucky. 
Music was always important to my family, but 
it was apparent early on that Wayland was 
gifted in that aspect. While we knew he was 
extremely talented, as we watched him lead 
the Wayne County High School marching 
band as drum major, we never dreamed he’d 
one day be nominated for a Grammy award. 
Wayland went on to study music at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, Wichita State University,

Northwestern University and the Mozarteum in 
Salzburg, Austria. He served as artistic direc-
tor/conductor of The Camerata Singers of 
Lake Forest, Illinois, and music director at 
North Shore Unitarian Church in Deerfield, Illi-
nois. He held faculty appointments at North-
western University, DePaul University, Loyola 
University/Chicago, and Western Kentucky 
University, among other schools. 
Wayland’s compositions garnered accolades 
from The Leeds University Liturgical Choir 
Competition, The Roger Wagner Center Cho-
ral Competition, Meistersingers Choral Com-
petition, The Chautauqua Chamber Singers 
Award, The Illinois American Choral Directors 
Association Choral Composition Competition, 
The Vincent B. Silliman Anthem Award and 
the Thornesian Prize from Chichester, Eng-
land. In 1986 his recording of Mozart with the 
Chicago Symphony Winds received a Grammy 
nomination for best chamber music, losing to 
Yo-Yo Ma. 
Wayland’s voice was a gift to his family. Al-
though he never had children of his own, he 
made a point of staying close with his nieces 
and nephews, and they adored him. His rich 
baritone voice graced many a family wedding 
and funeral. 
Wayland didn’t limit his magnificent voice to 
song. He was of the strong conviction that all 
people are created equal, and he used his 
voice to speak out against societal inequalities 
and injustices. 
His greatest legacy, though, will be the tal-
ented musicians whose careers he helped 
shape and will continue to help shape long 
after he’s gone. He loved to nurture talent, 
and throughout his career, Wayland offered 
guidance, motivation, and support to many 
young artists. With that goal in mind, before 
his death Wayland endowed a scholarship 
with the University of Kentucky’s School of 
Music. I and the rest of his family look forward 
to following the careers of the recipients of the 
Wayland Rogers Scholarship for Excellence in 
the Performance of Art Song. 
Through his music and the University of 
Kentucky School of Music scholarship that 
bears his name, Wayland’s voice will continue 
for generations. But for his family and friends, 
his compassion, zest for life, and love of ev-
erything beautiful will sing in our hearts for-
ever. Rest in peace, dear brother.

RECOGNIZING CONSTITUTION 
WEEK 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 3, 2021 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Constitution Week 
and the Theodosia Burr Chapter of the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution in Myrtle 
Beach, South Carolina. 
It is a privilege and duty of the American 
people to commemorate the two hundred thir-
ty-fourth anniversary of the drafting of the 
Constitution of the United States of America 
by the Constitutional Convention. As citizens 
of this great nation, we must reaffirm the 
ideals the Framers of the Constitution had in 
1787. 
Public Law 915 guarantees the issuing of a 
proclamation each year by the President of 
the Unites States of America designating Sep-
tember 17 through 23 as Constitution Week. It 
is fitting and proper to officially recognize this 
magnificent document and the anniversary of 
its creation. 
Madam Speaker, I join the Theodosia Burr 
Chapter of the Daughters of the American 
Revolution and the American people in recog-
nizing September 17 through September 23, 
2021 as Constitution Week and honor the 
Framers for their contributions.
