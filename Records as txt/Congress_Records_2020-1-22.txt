PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Sovereign God, author of liberty, we 
gather in this historic Chamber for the 
solemn responsibility of these im-
peachment proceedings. Give wisdom 
to the distinguished Chief Justice, 
John Roberts, as he presides. 
Lord, You are all-powerful and know 
our thoughts before we form them. As 
our lawmakers have become jurors, re-
mind them of Your admonition in 1 Co-
rinthians 10:31, that whatever they do 
should be done for Your glory. Help 
them remember that patriots reside on 
both sides of the aisle, that words have 
consequences, and that how something 
is said can be as important as what is 
said. Give them a civility built upon 
integrity that brings consistency in 
their beliefs and actions. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
for the information of all of our col-
leagues, no motions—no motions—were 
filed this morning, so we will proceed 
to the House managers’ presentation. 
We will go for approximately 2 hours 
and take a short recess when there is 
an appropriate break time between pre-
senters. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the man-
agers for the House of Representatives 
have 24 hours to make the presentation 
of their case. 
The Senate will now hear you. 
OPENING STATEMENT 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, counsel for the Presi-
dent, and my fellow House managers: I 
want to begin by thanking you, Chief 
Justice, for a very long day, for the 
way you have presided over these pro-
ceedings. I want to thank the Senators 
also. We went well into the morning, as 
you know, until I believe around 2 in 
the morning. You paid attention to 
every word and argument you heard 
from both sides in this impeachment 
trial, and I know we are both deeply 
grateful for that. 
It was an exhausting day for us, cer-
tainly, but we have adrenaline going 
through our veins. For those who are 
required to sit and listen, it is a much 
more difficult task. Of course, we know 
our positions. You have the added dif-
ficulty of having to weigh the facts and 
the law. So I want to begin today by 
thanking you for the conduct of the 
proceedings 
yesterday 
and 
inviting 
your patience as we go forward. We 
have some very long days yet to come. 
So let us begin. 
‘‘When a man unprincipled in private 
life, desperate in his fortune, bold in 
his temper, possessed of considerable 
talents, having the advantage of mili-

demeanor, known to have scoffed in

when such a man is seen to mount the 
hobby horse of popularity, to join in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S444 
January 22, 2020 
the day, it may justly be suspected 
that his object is to throw things into 
confusion that he may ride the storm 
and direct the whirlwind.’’ 
Those words were written by Alex-
ander Hamilton in a letter to President 
George Washington at the height of the 
panic of 1792, a financial credit crisis 
that shook our young Nation. Ham-
ilton was responding to sentiments re-
layed to Washington as he traveled the 
country that America, in the face of 
that crisis, might descend from a re-
publican form of government, plunging 
instead into that of monarchy. 
The Framers of the Constitution wor-
ried then, as we worry today, that a 
leader might come to power not to 
carry out the will of the people he was 
elected to represent but to pursue his 
own interests. They feared that a 
President would subvert our democracy 
by abusing the awesome power of his 
office for his own personal or political 
gain. And so they devised a remedy as 
powerful as the evil it was meant to 
combat: impeachment. 
As centuries have passed, our Found-
ers achieved an almost mythical char-
acter. We are aware of their flaws, cer-
tainly some very painful and pro-
nounced indeed. Yet, when it came to 
the drafting of the new system of gov-
ernment never seen before and with no 
guarantee it would succeed, we cannot 
help but be in awe of their genius, their 
prescience even, vindicated time and 
again. 
Still, maybe because of their bril-
liance and the brilliance of their words, 
we find year after year it more difficult 
to imagine them as human beings. This 
is no less true of Alexander Hamilton, 
notwithstanding his recent return to 
celebrity. But they were human beings. 
They understood human frailties, even 
as they exhibited them. They could ap-
preciate, just as we can, how power can 
corrupt. Even as we struggle to under-
stand how the Framers might have re-
sponded to Presidential misconduct of 
the kind and character that we are 
here to try, we should not imagine for 
one moment that they lacked basic 
common sense or refuse to apply it our-
selves. 
They knew what it was like to live 
under a despot, and they risked their 
lives to be free of it. They knew they 
were creating an enormously powerful 
executive, and they knew they needed 
to constrain it. They did not intend for 
the power of impeachment to be used 
frequently or over mere matters of pol-
icy, but they put it in the Constitution 
for a reason: for a man who would sub-
vert the interests of the Nation to pur-
sue his own interests; for a man who 
would seek to perpetuate himself in of-
fice by inviting foreign interference 
and cheating in an election; for a man 
who would be disdainful of constitu-
tional limit, ignoring or defeating the 
other branches of government and 
their coequal powers; for a man who 
believed that the Constitution gave 
him the right to do anything he wanted 
and practiced in the art of deception; 
for a man who believed that he was 
above the law and beholden to no one; 
for a man, in short, who would be a 
King. 
We are here today in this hallowed 
Chamber undertaking this solemn ac-
tion for only the third time in history 
because Donald J. Trump, the 45th 
President of the United States, has 
acted precisely as Hamilton and his 
contemporaries 
feared. 
President 
Trump solicited foreign interference in 
our democratic elections, abusing the 
power of his office, to seek help from 
abroad to improve his reelection pros-
pects at home. When he was caught, he 
used the powers of that office to ob-
struct the investigation into his own 
misconduct. 
To implement this corrupt scheme, 
President Trump pressured the Presi-
dent of Ukraine to publicly announce 
investigations into two discredited al-
legations that would benefit President 
Trump’s 2020 Presidential campaign. 
When the Ukrainian President did not 
immediately assent, President Trump 
withheld two official acts to induce the 
Ukrainian leader to comply: a head-of- 
state meeting in the Oval Office and 
military funding. Both were of bright 
consequence to Ukraine and to our na-
tional interests in security, but one 
looms largest. President Trump with-
held hundreds of millions of dollars in 
military aid to a strategic partner at 
war with Russia to secure foreign help 
with his reelection—in other words, to 
cheat. 
In this way, the President used offi-
cial state powers available only to him 
and unavailable to any political oppo-
nent to advantage himself in a demo-
cratic election. His scheme was under-
taken for a simple but corrupt reason— 
to help him win reelection in 2020. But 
the effect of the scheme was to under-
mine our free and fair elections and to 
put our national security at risk. 
It was not even necessary that 
Ukraine undertake the political inves-
tigations the President was seeking. 
They merely had to announce them. 
This 
is 
significant, 
for 
President 
Trump had no interest in fighting cor-
ruption, as he would claim after he was 
caught. Rather, his interest was in fur-
thering corruption by the announce-
ment of investigations that were com-
pletely without merit. 
The first sham investigation that 
President Trump desired was into 
former Vice President Joe Biden, who 
had sought the removal of a corrupt 
Ukrainian prosecutor during the pre-
vious U.S. administration. 
The Vice President acted in accord-
ance with U.S. official policy at the 
time and was supported unanimously 
by our European allies and key global 
financial institutions, such as the 
International Monetary Fund, which 
shared the concern over corruption. 
Despite this fact, in the course of 
this scheme, President Trump and his 
agents pressed the Ukrainian President 
to announce an investigation into the 
false claim that Vice President Biden 
wanted the corrupt prosecutor removed 
from power in order to stop an inves-
tigation into Burisma Holdings, a com-
pany on whose board Biden’s son Hun-
ter sat. 
This allegation is simply untrue. It 
has been widely debunked by Ukrain-
ian and American experts alike. That 
reality mattered not to President 
Trump. To him, the value in promoting 
a negative tale about former Vice 
President Biden—true or false—was its 
usefulness to his reelection campaign. 
It was a smear tactic against a polit-
ical opponent that President Trump 
apparently feared. 
Remarkably but predictably, Russia, 
too, has sought to support this effort to 
smear Mr. Biden, reportedly hacking 
into the Ukraine energy company at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
President’s 
disinformation 
campaign 
only 
last 
week. 
Russia almost certainly was looking 
for information related to the former 
Vice President’s son so that the Krem-
lin could also weaponize it against Mr. 
Biden, just like it did against Hillary 
Clinton in 2016, when Russia hacked 
and released emails from her Presi-
dential campaign. 
President Trump has made it abun-
dantly clear that he would like nothing 
more than to make use of such dirt 
against Mr. Biden, just as he made use 
of Secretary Clinton’s hacked and re-
leased emails in his previous Presi-
dential campaign. 
That brings us to the other sham in-
vestigation that President Trump de-
manded 
the 
Ukrainian 
leader 
an-
nounce. This investigation was related 
to a debunked conspiracy theory, alleg-
ing that Ukraine, not Russia, inter-
fered in the 2016 Presidential election. 
This narrative, propagated by the Rus-
sian intelligence services, contends 
that Ukraine sought to help Hillary 
Clinton 
and 
harm 
then-Candidate 
Trump and that a computer server pro-
viding this fiction is hidden somewhere 
in Ukraine. 
That is the so-called CrowdStrike 
conspiracy theory. This tale is also 
patently false, and, remarkably, it is 
precisely the inverse of what the U.S. 
intelligence communities’ unanimous 
assessment was that Russia interfered 
in the 2016 election in sweeping in sys-
temic fashion in order to hurt Hillary 
Clinton and help Donald Trump. 
Nevertheless, the President evidently 
believed that a public announcement 
lending credence to these allegations 
by the Ukrainian President could as-
sist his reelection by putting to rest 
any doubts Americans may have had 
over the legitimacy of his first elec-
tion, even as he invited foreign inter-
ference in the next. 
To the degree that most Americans 
have followed the President’s efforts to 
involve another foreign power in our 
election, they may be most familiar 
with his entreaty to the Ukrainian 
President on the now infamous July 25 
call to ‘‘do us a favor, though’’ and in-
vestigate Biden and the 2016 conspiracy 
theory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S445 
January 22, 2020 
That call was not the beginning of 
the story of the President’s corrupt 
scheme, nor was it the end. Rather, it 
was merely part—although, a signifi-
cant part—of a months’ long effort by 
President Trump and his allies and as-
sociates who applied significant and in-
creasing pressure on Ukraine to an-
nounce these two politically motivated 
investigations. 
Key figures in the Trump administra-
tion were aware or directly involved or 
participated in the scheme. As we saw 
yesterday, one witness—a million-dol-
lar donor to the President’s inaugural 
committee put it this way: Everyone 
was in the loop. 
After twice inviting Ukraine’s new 
President to the White House without 
providing a specific date for the pro-
posed visit, President Trump condi-
tioned 
this 
coveted 
Head-of-State 
meeting on the announcement of these 
sham investigations. For Ukraine’s 
new and untested leader, an official 
meeting with the President of the 
United States in the Oval Office was 
critical. It would help bestow on him 
important, domestic, and international 
legitimacy, as he sought to implement 
an ambitious anti-corruption platform. 
Actual and apparent support from 
the President of the United States 
would also strengthen his position as 
he sought to negotiate a peace agree-
ment with Russia’s President Vladimir 
Putin, seeking an end to Russia’s ille-
gal annexation and continued military 
occupation of parts of Ukraine. 
But 
most 
pernicious, 
President 
Trump petitioned hundreds of millions 
of dollars in congressionally appro-
priated taxpayer-funded military as-
sistance for the same purpose to apply 
more pressure on Ukraine’s leader to 
announce the investigations. This mili-
tary aid, which has long enjoyed bipar-
tisan support, was designed to help 
Ukraine defend itself from the Krem-
lin’s aggression. 
More than 15,000 Ukrainians have 
died fighting Russian forces and their 
proxies—15,000. The military aid was 
for such essentials as sniper rifles, 
rocket-propelled 
grenade 
launchers, 
radar night-vision goggles, and other 
vital support for the war effort. 
Most critically, the military aid we 
provide Ukraine helps to protect and 
advance American national security in-
terests in the region and beyond. 
America has an abiding interest in 
stemming Russian expansionism and 
resisting any nations’ efforts to re-
make the map of Europe by dint of 
military force, even as we have tens of 
thousands of troops stationed there. 
Moreover, as one witness put it dur-
ing our impeachment inquiry, the 
United States aids Ukraine and her 
people so that we can fight Russia over 
there and we don’t have to fight Russia 
here. 
When the President’s scheme was ex-
posed and the House of Representatives 
properly performed its constitutional 
responsibility to investigate the mat-
ter, President Trump used the same 
unrivaled authority at his disposal as 
Commander in Chief to cover up his 
wrongdoing. 
In unprecedented fashion, the Presi-
dent 
ordered 
the 
entire 
executive 
branch of the United States of America 
to categorically refuse and completely 
obstruct the House’s impeachment in-
vestigation. Such a wholesale obstruc-
tion of congressional impeachment has 
never before occurred in our democ-
racy. It represents one of the most bla-
tant efforts of a coverup in history. 
If not remedied by his conviction in 
the Senate and removal from office, 
President Trump’s abuse of his office 
and obstruction of Congress will per-
manently alter the balance of power 
among the branches of government, in-
viting future Presidents to operate as 
if they are also beyond the reach of ac-
countability, congressional oversight, 
and the law. 
On the basis of this egregious mis-
conduct, the House of Representatives 
returned two Articles of Impeachment 
against the President: first, charging 
that President Trump corruptly abused 
the powers of the Presidency to solicit 
foreign interference in the upcoming 
Presidential election for his personal 
political benefit; and, second, that 
President Trump obstructed an im-
peachment inquiry into that abuse of 
power in order to cover up his mis-
conduct. 
The House did not take this extraor-
dinary step lightly. As we will discuss, 
impeachment exists for cases in which 
the conduct of the President rises be-
yond mere policy disputes to be de-
cided otherwise and without urgency at 
the ballot box. 
Instead, we are here today to con-
sider a much more grave matter, and 
that is an attempt to use the powers of 
the Presidency to cheat in an election. 
For precisely this reason, the Presi-
dent’s misconduct cannot be decided at 
the ballot box, for we cannot be as-
sured that the vote will be fairly won. 
In corruptly using his office to gain a 
political advantage, in abusing the 
powers of that office in such a way to 
jeopardize our national security and 
the integrity of our elections, in ob-
structing the investigation into his 
own wrongdoing, the President has 
shown that he believes that he is above 
the law and scornful of constraint. 
As we saw yesterday on the screen, 
under article II he can do anything he 
wants. Moreover, given the seriousness 
of the conduct at issue and its persist-
ence, this matter cannot and must not 
be decided by the courts, which apart 
from the presence of the Chief Justice 
here today, are given no role in im-
peachments in either the House or the 
Senate. 
Being drawn into litigation, taking 
many months or years to complete, 
would provide the President with an 
opportunity 
to 
continue 
his 
mis-
conduct. He would remain secure in the 
knowledge that he may tie up the Con-
gress and the courts indefinitely, as he 
has with Don McGahn, rendering the 
impeachment power effectively mean-
ingless. 
We also took the step with the 
knowledge that this was not the first 
time the President solicited foreign in-
terference in our elections. In 2016, 
then-candidate Trump implored Russia 
to hack his opponent’s email account, 
something that the Russian military 
agency did only hours later—only 
hours later. 
When the President said, ‘‘hey, Rus-
sia, if you’re listening,’’ they were lis-
tening. Only hours later they hacked 
his opponent’s campaign. 
The President has made it clear this 
would also not be the last time, asking 
China only recently to join Ukraine in 
investigating his political opponent. 
Over 
the 
coming 
days, 
we 
will 
present to you and to the American 
people the extensive evidence collected 
during the House’s impeachment in-
quiry into the President’s abuse of 
power—overwhelming 
evidence, 
not-
withstanding his unprecedented and 
wholesale obstruction of the investiga-
tion into that misconduct. 
You will hear and read testimony 
from courageous public servants who 
upheld their oath to the Constitution 
and their legal obligations to comply 
with congressional action, despite a 
categorical order by President Trump 
not to cooperate with the impeachment 
inquiry. 
These are courageous Americans who 
were told by the President of the 
United States not to cooperate, not to 
appear, not to testify, but who had the 
sense of duty to do so. But more than 
that, you will hear from witnesses who 
have not yet testified, such as John 
Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Blair 
and Mr. Duffey. And if you can believe 
the President’s words last month, you 
will also hear from Secretary Pompeo. 
You will hear their testimony at the 
same time as the American people; 
that is, if you allow it, if we have a fair 
trial. 
During our presentation, you will see 
documentary records, those the Presi-
dent was unable to suppress, that ex-
posed the President’s scheme in detail. 
You will learn of further evidence that 
has been revealed in the days since the 
House voted to impeach President 
Trump, even as the President and his 
agents have persisted in their efforts to 
cover up their wrongdoing from Con-
gress and the public. 
You will see dozens of new documents 
providing new and critical evidence of 
the President’s guilt that remain at 
this time in the President’s hands and 
in the hands of the Department of De-
fense and the Department of State and 
the Office of Management and Budget, 
even the White House. You will see 
them and so will the American people 
if you allow it—if, in the name of a fair 
trial, you will demand it. 
These are politically charged times. 
Tempers can run high, particularly 
where this President is concerned, but 
these are not unique times. Deep divi-
sions and disagreements were hardly

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S446 
January 22, 2020 
alien concepts to the Framers so they 
designed impeachment power in such a 
way as to insulate it as best they could 
from the crush of partisan politics. The 
Framers placed the question of re-
moval before the Senate, a body able to 
rise above the fray, to soberly judge 
the President’s conduct or misconduct 
for what it was, nothing more and 
nothing less. 
In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton wrote: 
Where else than in the Senate could have 
been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, 
or sufficiently independent? What other body 
would be likely to feel confidence enough in 
its own situation, to preserve, unawed and 
uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality be-
tween an individual accused, and the rep-
resentatives of the people, his accusers? 
It is up to you to be the tribunal that 
Hamilton envisioned. It is up to you to 
show the American people and your-
selves that his confidence and that of 
the other Founders was rightly placed. 
The Constitution entrusts you to the 
responsibility of acting as impartial ju-
rors, to hold a fair and thorough trial, 
and to weigh the evidence before you 
no matter what your party affiliation 
or your vote in the previous election or 
the next. Our duty is to the Constitu-
tion and to the rule of law. 
I recognize there will be times during 
the trial that you may long to return 
to the business of the Senate. The 
American people look forward to the 
same but not before you decide what 
kind of democracy that you believe we 
ought to be and what the American 
people have a right to expect in the 
conduct of their President. 
The House believes that an impartial 
juror, upon hearing the evidence that 
the managers will lay out in the com-
ing days, will find that the Constitu-
tion demands the removal of Donald J. 
Trump from his office as President of 
the United States. But that will be for 
you to decide. With the weight of his-
tory upon you, and as President Ken-
nedy once said: ‘‘With a good con-
science our only sure reward. . . . ’’ 
In drafting our Constitution, the 
Framers designed a new and untested 
form of government. It would be based 
on free and fair elections to ensure 
that our political leaders would be cho-
sen democratically and by citizens of 
our country alone. Having broken free 
from a King with unbridled authority 
who often placed his own interests 
above that of the people, the Framers 
established a structure that would 
guarantee that the Chief Executive’s 
power flowed only from his obligation 
to the people rather than from a sov-
ereign whose power was confirmed on 
him by divine right. 
In this new architecture, no branch 
of government or individual would pre-
dominate over another. In this way, 
the Founders ensured that their elect-
ed leaders and their President would 
use the powers of office only to under-
take that which the people desired and 
not for their personal aggrandizement 
or enrichment. 
What did those who rebelled and 
fought a revolution desire? Nothing dif-
ferent than what we, the generations 
that have followed, desire: that no per-
son, including and especially the Presi-
dent, would be above the law. Nothing 
could be more dangerous to a democ-
racy than a Commander in Chief who 
believed that he could operate with im-
punity, free from accountability—noth-
ing, that is, except a Congress that is 
willing to let it be so. 
To ensure that no such threat can 
take root and subvert our fledgling de-
mocracy, the Framers divided power 
among three coequal branches of gov-
ernment—the executive, the legisla-
tive, and the judicial branches—so that 
ambition may be made to counter am-
bition. They provided for Presidential 
elections every 4 years, and the Fram-
ers required that the President swear 
an oath to faithfully execute the law 
and to preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Even with these guardrails in place, 
the Framers understood an individual 
could come to power who defied that 
solemn oath, who pursued his own in-
terests rather than those of the coun-
try he led. For that reason, the Fram-
ers adopted a tool used by the British 
Parliament to restrain its officials: the 
power of impeachment. Rather than a 
mechanism to overturn an election, 
impeachment would be a remedy of 
last resort, and, unlike in England, the 
Framers applied this ultimate check to 
the highest office in the land, to the 
President of the United States. Im-
peachment removal of a duly elected 
President was not intended for policy 
disputes or poor administration of the 
State. Instead, the Framers had in 
mind the most serious of offenses: 
those against the public itself. 
Hamilton explained that impeach-
ment was not designed to cover only 
statutory common law crimes but in-
stead crimes against the body politic. 
Hamilton wrote: 
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those 
offenses which proceed from the misconduct 
of public men, or, in other words, from the 
abuse or violation of some public trust. They 
are of a nature which may, with peculiar 
propriety, be denominated political, as they 
relate chiefly to injuries done immediately 
to the society itself. 
In other words, impeachment would 
be confined to abuses of people’s trust 
and to the society itself. This is pre-
cisely the abuse that has been under-
taken by our current President when 
he withheld money in support for an 
ally at war to secure a political ben-
efit. The punishment for those crimes 
would fit the political nature of the of-
fense. As James Wilson—a delegate of 
the Constitutional Convention and a 
future Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court—reasoned that impeach-
ment ‘‘was confined to political char-
acters, to political crimes and mis-
demeanors, and to political punish-
ments.’’ The Framers determined that 
punishment would be neither prison 
nor fines but, instead, limited to re-
moval from office and disqualification 
from holding future office. 
The Framers chose to undertake im-
peachment for treason, bribery, or 
other high crimes and misdemeanors to 
underscore the requirement of an of-
fense against society. In this phrase, 
‘‘high’’ modifies both the crimes and 
the misdemeanors in that both relate 
to a high injustice, a transgression 
committed against the people and to 
the public trust. The Framers had two 
broad categories in mind: those actions 
that are facially permissible under the 
President’s authority but are based on 
corrupt motives, such as seeking to ob-
tain a personal benefit through public 
office, and those that far exceed the 
President’s constitutional authority or 
violate the legal limits on that author-
ity. 
In article I, we deal with the first 
evil which the Framers wished to guard 
against; that is, cases in which a Presi-
dent corruptly misused the power oth-
erwise bestowed on him to secure a per-
sonal reward. Guarding against a Presi-
dent who undertakes official acts with 
a corrupt motive of helping himself is 
at the heart of the impeachment 
power. As one scholar explained, the 
President’s duty to faithfully execute 
the law requires that he undertakes ac-
tions only when motivated in the pub-
lic interest rather than in their private 
self-interest. Efforts to withhold offi-
cial acts for personal gain counter-
mand the President’s sacred oath and, 
therefore, constitute impeachable be-
havior as it was conceived by the 
Framers. 
In article II, we also deal with the 
second 
evil 
contemplated 
by 
the 
Founders, who made it clear that the 
President ought not operate beyond 
the limits placed on him by legislative 
and judicial branches. Impeachment 
was warranted for a President who 
usurped the power of the Constitution 
that was not granted to him, such as to 
defy Congress the right to determine 
the propriety, the scope, and the na-
ture of an impeachment inquiry into 
his own misconduct. 
The Framers fashioned a powerful 
Chief Executive but not one beyond ac-
countability of law. When a President 
wields power in ways that are inappro-
priate and seek to extinguish the 
rights of Congress, he exceeds the 
power of constitutional authority and 
violates the limits placed on his con-
duct. Obstruction of a separate and co-
equal branch of government for the 
purposes of covering up an abuse of 
power not only implies a corrupt intent 
but also demonstrates a remarkable 
antipathy toward the balance of power 
contemplated and enshrined in our 
Constitution. It is a betrayal of the 
President’s sacred oath of office and of 
his duty to put the country before him-
self. 
On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the 
House NANCY PELOSI announced that 
the House of Representatives would 
move forward with an official impeach-
ment inquiry into President Donald J. 
Trump. The announcement followed 
public reporting in the United States

January 22, 2020 
and Ukraine that the President and his 
agents sought Ukraine’s help in his re-
election effort and revelations that the 
White House was blocking from Con-
gress an intelligence community whis-
tleblower complaint possibly related to 
this grave offense. 
The next day, on September 25, under 
extraordinary 
pressure, 
the 
White 
House released publicly the record of 
the July 25 call between President 
Trump and Ukrainian President Vladi-
mir Zelensky. The call record revealed 
that President Trump explicitly re-
quested that the new leader undertake 
investigations beneficial to President 
Trump’s reelection campaign. Upon re-
lease of the record of the call, Presi-
dent Trump claimed that the call was 
‘‘perfect.’’ Far from perfect, the call 
record revealed a President who used 
his high office to personally and di-
rectly press the leader of a foreign 
country to do his political dirty work. 
Asking for a favor, President Trump 
insisted that President Zelensky inves-
tigate a formidable potential political 
opponent, former Vice President Joe 
Biden, as well as the baseless con-
spiracy theory that Ukraine, not Rus-
sia, interfered in the 2016 election to 
assist then-Candidate Trump’s oppo-
nent. 
Witnesses who listened to the call as 
it transpired testified that they imme-
diately recognized these requests did 
not represent official U.S. policy and, 
instead, were politically charged ap-
peals, not appropriate for a President 
to make. Key witnesses emphasized it 
was not necessary that Ukraine actu-
ally undertake the investigations, only 
that the Ukrainian President denounce 
them. 
President Trump’s objective was not 
to encourage a foreign government to 
investigate legitimate allegations of 
misconduct 
or 
wrongdoing 
abroad, 
made clear, as well, by the fact that 
the 
investigations 
he 
wanted 
an-
nounced have been discredited entirely. 
Rather, the President simply wanted to 
reap a political benefit by tarnishing a 
political rival and in attempting to 
erase from history his previous elec-
tion 
misconduct. 
To 
compel 
the 
Ukrainian President to do his political 
dirty work, President Trump withheld 
from President Zelensky two official 
acts of great importance: that coveted 
White House meeting to which Presi-
dent Zelensky had already been invited 
and $391 million in military assistance 
for the Ukrainians to fight the Rus-
sians. 
For a strategic partner of the United 
States in a hot war with Russian- 
backed forces inside its own borders, 
this symbolic support conferred on it 
by an Oval Office visit with the Presi-
dent of the United States and the life-
saving support of our military aid was 
essential. As the House’s presentation 
will make clear, in directly soliciting 
foreign interference and withholding 
those official acts in exchange for the 
announcement of political investiga-
tions beneficial to his election, the 
President put his own interest above 
the national interest. 
President Trump undermined the in-
tegrity of our free and fair elections by 
pressing a foreign power to influence 
our most sacred right as citizens, our 
right to freely choose our leaders, and 
he threatened our national security by 
withholding critical aid from a partner 
on the frontlines of war with Russia, an 
aggressor that has threatened peace 
and stability on an entire continent. In 
so doing, the President sacrificed not 
only the security of our European al-
lies but also our Nation’s core national 
security interests. President Trump 
undertook 
this 
pressure 
campaign 
through handpicked agents inside and 
outside 
of 
government 
who 
cir-
cumvented traditional policy channels. 
President 
Trump 
intentionally 
by-
passed many U.S. Government career 
officials 
with 
responsibility 
over 
Ukraine and advanced his scheme pri-
marily through the effort of his per-
sonal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Presi-
dent Trump carried out this scheme 
with the knowledge of senior adminis-
tration officials, including the Presi-
dent’s Acting Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo, Vice President MIKE PENCE, 
National Security Council Legal Advi-
sor John Eisenberg, and White House 
Counsel Pat Cipollone. 
When the President became aware 
that the scheme would be uncovered, 
he undertook an unprecedented effort 
to obstruct the House of Representa-
tives’ impeachment inquiry to hide it 
from the public and from Congress, in-
cluding all evidence related to his mis-
conduct. That coverup continues today 
as the administration has not provided 
a single document pursuant to lawful 
subpoenas by the House. 
The administration also continues to 
prevent witnesses from cooperating, 
further obstructing the House’s ef-
forts—efforts 
the 
President 
is, 
no 
doubt, proud of but which threaten the 
integrity of this institution and this 
Congress 
as 
a 
coequal 
branch 
of 
power—and our ability not only to do 
oversight but to hold a President who 
is unindictable accountable. 
Despite these efforts to obstruct our 
inquiry, the House of Representatives 
uncovered overwhelming evidence re-
lated to the President’s misconduct 
through interviews with 17 witnesses 
who appeared before the Intelligence, 
Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Af-
fairs Committees. Many of these wit-
nesses bravely defied White House or-
ders not to comply with duly author-
ized congressional subpoenas. Were it 
not for them—were it not for Ambas-
sador Marie Yovanovitch, who was the 
first 
through 
the 
breach—we 
may 
never have known of the President’s 
scheme. 
I want you to imagine, just for a 
minute, what kind of courage that 
took for Ambassador Yovanovitch—the 
subject of that vicious smear cam-
paign—to risk her reputation and her 
career to stand up to the President of 
the United States, who was instructing 
her through his agents: You will not 
cooperate. You will not testify. You 
will tell them nothing. 
Then, there is Bill Taylor, a West 
Point graduate and a Vietnam veteran 
with a Bronze Star and something he 
was even more proud of—the Combat 
Infantryman Badge. He knows what 
courage is. He showed a different kind 
of courage in Vietnam, but he also 
showed courage, as did others, in com-
ing forward and defying the President’s 
order that he obstruct to tell the 
American people what he knew. 
But for the courage of people like 
them and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, 
a Purple Heart recipient, we would 
know nothing of the President’s mis-
conduct—nothing. When the President 
directs his ire toward these people, this 
is why—because they showed the cour-
age to come forward. 
Now, in the Intelligence Committee, 
we held 7 open hearings with 12 fact 
witnesses. Separately, the Judiciary 
Committee held public hearings with 
constitutional law experts and counsel 
from the House Intelligence Committee 
as it sought to determine whether to 
draft and consider Articles of Impeach-
ment. The House also collected text 
messages related to the President’s 
scheme from a witness who provided 
limited personal communications. 
Since the conclusion of our inquiry, 
new evidence has continued to come to 
light, through court-ordered releases of 
administration documents and public 
reporting, underscoring that there is 
significantly more evidence of the 
President’s guilt which he continues to 
block from Congress, including the 
Senate. Nevertheless, the documents 
and testimony that we were able to 
collect paint an overwhelming and 
damning picture of the President’s ef-
forts to use the powers of his office to 
corruptly solicit foreign help in his re-
election campaign and withhold offi-
cial acts and military aid to compel 
that support. 
Over the coming days, you will hear 
remarkably 
consistent 
evidence 
of 
President Trump’s corrupt scheme and 
coverup. When you focus on the evi-
dence uncovered during the investiga-
tion, you will appreciate there is no se-
rious dispute about the facts under-
lying the President’s conduct, and this 
is why you will hear the President’s 
lawyers make the astounding claim: 
You can’t impeach a President for 
abusing the powers of his office. It is 
because they can’t seriously contest 
that that is exactly—exactly—what he 
did, and so they must go find a lawyer 
somewhere. 
Apparently, they could not go to 
their own Attorney General. It was just 
reported in a memo he wrote, as part of 
the audition for Attorney General, that 
the President can be impeached for 
abusing the public trust. He couldn’t 
go to Bill Barr for that opinion. He 
couldn’t even go to Jonathan Turley, 
their expert in the House, for an opin-
ion. No, they had to go outside of these

experts, outside of constitutional law, 
to a criminal defense lawyer and pro-
fessor. And why? Because they can’t 
contest the facts. The President was 
the key player in the scheme. Everyone 
was in the loop. He directed the actions 
of his team. He personally asked a for-
eign government to investigate his op-
ponent. These facts are not in dispute. 
Ultimately, the question for you is 
whether the President’s undisputed ac-
tions require the removal of the 45th 
President of the United States from of-
fice because he abused his office and 
the public trust by using his power for 
personal gain by seeking illicit foreign 
assistance in his reelection and cov-
ering it up. 
Other than voting on whether to send 
our men and women to war, there is, I 
think, no greater responsibility than 
the one before you now. The oath that 
you have taken to impartially weigh 
the facts and evidence requires serious 
and objective consideration—decisions 
that are about country, not party; 
about the Constitution, not politics; 
about what is right and what is wrong. 
After you consider the evidence and 
weigh your oath to render a fair and 
impartial verdict, I suggest to you 
today that the only conclusion con-
sistent with the facts and law—not just 
the law but the Constitution—is clear 
as described by constitutional law ex-
perts’ testimony before the House: If 
this conduct is not impeachable, then 
nothing is. 
Let me take a moment to describe to 
you how we intend to present the case 
over the coming days. 
You will hear today the details of the 
President’s corrupt scheme in nar-
rative form, illustrating the timeline 
of the effort through the testimony of 
the numerous witnesses who came be-
fore the House as well as through docu-
ments and materials we collected as 
evidence 
during 
the 
investigation. 
After you hear the factual chronology, 
we will then discuss the constitutional 
framework of impeachment as it was 
envisioned by the Founders. 
Before we analyze how the facts of 
the President’s misconduct and cover-
up lead to the conclusion that the 
President undertook the sort of cor-
rupt course of conduct that impeach-
ment was intended to remedy, let me 
start with a preview of the President’s 
scheme, the details of which you will 
hear during the course of this day. 
President 
Trump’s 
months-long 
scheme to extract help with his 2020 re-
election 
campaign 
from 
the 
new 
Ukrainian President involved an effort 
to solicit and then compel the new 
leader to announce political investiga-
tions. The announcement would ref-
erence two specific investigations. One 
was intended to undermine the unani-
mous consensus of our intelligence 
agencies, Congress, and Special Coun-
sel Robert Mueller that Russia inter-
fered in the 2016 election to help then- 
Candidate Trump and another to hurt 
the Presidency of former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden. 
The Kremlin itself has been respon-
sible for first propagating one of the 
two false narratives that the President 
desired. In February 2017, less than a 
month after the U.S. intelligence com-
munity released its assessment that 
Russia alone was responsible for a cov-
ert influence campaign designed to 
help President Trump win the 2016 elec-
tion, President Putin said: 
As we all know, during the Presidential 
campaign in the United States, the Ukrain-
ian government adopted a unilateral posi-
tion in favor of one candidate. More than 
that, certain oligarchs—certainly with the 
approval of political leadership—funded this 
candidate—or a female candidate to be more 
precise. 
Those were Putin’s words on Feb-
ruary 2, 2017. 
Of course, this is false, and it is part 
of a Russian counternarrative that 
President Trump and some of his allies 
have adopted. 
Fiona Hill, the Senior Director for 
Europe and Russia at the National Se-
curity Council, described Russia’s ef-
fort to promote this baseless theory. 
(Text of videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. Based on questions and state-
ments I have heard, some of you on this com-
mittee appear to believe that Russia and its 
Security Services did not conduct a cam-
paign against our country and that, perhaps, 
somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This 
is a fictional narrative that has been per-
petrated and propagated by the Russian Se-
curity Services themselves. The unfortunate 
truth is that Russia was that foreign power 
that systematically attacked our democratic 
institutions in 2016. This is the public con-
clusion of our intelligence agencies, con-
firmed by bipartisan congressional reports. 
It is beyond dispute even if some of the un-
derlying details must remain classified. 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF. 
This, 
of 
course, was not the first time that 
President Trump embraced Russian ac-
tivity and disinformation. 
On July 24 of last year, Special Coun-
sel Robert Mueller testified before Con-
gress that Russia interfered in the 2016 
election in a ‘‘sweeping and systemic 
fashion’’ to benefit Donald Trump’s po-
litical campaign. Mueller and his team 
found ‘‘the Russian Government per-
ceived that it would benefit from a 
Trump Presidency and worked to se-
cure that outcome.’’ They also found 
that the Trump campaign expected it 
would benefit electorally from infor-
mation stolen and released through 
Russian efforts. 
Just 
as 
he 
solicited 
help 
from 
Ukraine in 2019, in 2016 then-Candidate 
Trump also solicited help from Russia 
in his election effort. As you will re-
call, at a rally in Florida, he said the 
following: 
(Text of videotape presentation:) 
Mr. TRUMP. Russia, if you are listening, I 
hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails 
that are missing. I think you will probably 
be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see 
if that happens. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Following Spe-
cial Counsel Mueller’s testimony, dur-
ing which he warned against future in-
terference in our elections, did the 
President recognize the threat posed to 
our democracy and renounce Russian 
interference in our democracy? Did he 
choose to stand with his own intel-
ligence agencies, both Houses of Con-
gress, and the special counsel’s inves-
tigation in affirming that Russia inter-
fered in our last election? 
He did not. 
Instead, only one day after Special 
Counsel Mueller testified before Con-
gress, empowered in the belief that he 
had evaded accountability for making 
use of foreign support in our last elec-
tion, President Trump was on the 
phone with the President of Ukraine, 
pressing him to intervene on President 
Trump’s behalf in the next election. 
Let’s take a moment to let that sink 
in. 
On July 24, Bob Mueller concludes a 
lengthy investigation. He comes before 
the Congress. He testifies that Russia 
systemically interfered in our election 
to help elect Donald Trump, that the 
campaign understood that, and that 
they willfully made use of that help. 
On July 24, that is what happens. 
On the very next day—the very next 
day—President Trump is on the phone 
with a different foreign power, this 
time Ukraine, trying to get Ukraine to 
interfere in the next election—the next 
day. 
That should tell us something. He did 
not feel chained by what the special 
counsel found. He did not feel deterred 
by what the special counsel found. He 
felt emboldened by escaping account-
ability, for the very, very next day, he 
is on the phone, soliciting foreign in-
terference again. 
Now, that July 25 phone call between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky was a key part of President 
Trump’s direct and corrupt solicitation 
of foreign help in the 2020 election. 
The question likely sounded familiar 
to President Zelensky, who had been 
swept into office in a landslide victory 
on a campaign of rooting out just the 
type of corruption he was being asked 
to undertake on this call with our 
President. 
Zelensky campaigned as a reformer, 
as someone outside of politics who 
would come up and clean up corrup-
tion, who would end the political pros-
ecutions, end the political investiga-
tions. And what is his most important 
and powerful patron asking him to do? 
To do exactly what he campaigned 
against. No wonder he resisted this 
pressure campaign. 
Now, President Trump had been pro-
vided talking points for discussion by 
the National Security Council staff be-
forehand, including recommendations 
to encourage President Zelensky to 
continue to promote anti-corruption 
reforms in Ukraine. So the National 
Security staff understood what was in 
the U.S. national security interests, 
and that was rooting out corruption, 
and they encouraged the President to 
talk about it. 
But as you see from the record of the 
call—and I join the President in saying 
‘‘read the call’’—that topic was never

S449 
January 22, 2020 
addressed. 
The 
word 
‘‘corruption’’ 
never escapes his lips. 
Instead, 
President 
Trump 
openly 
pressed President Zelensky to pursue 
the two investigations that would ben-
efit him personally. 
In response to President Zelensky’s 
gratitude for the significant military 
support the United States had provided 
to Ukraine, President Trump said: 
I would like you to do us a favor though 
because our country has been through a lot 
and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would 
like you to find out what happened with this 
whole situation with Ukraine, they say 
CrowdStrike . . . I guess you have one of 
your wealthy people . . . The server, they 
say Ukraine has it. 
That is that crazy conspiracy theory 
I talked about earlier that there is this 
server somewhere in Ukraine that 
shows that, in fact, it was Ukraine that 
hacked the DNC, not the Russians. 
That is a Russian propaganda con-
spiracy theory, and here it is being pro-
mulgated by the President of the 
United States. And more than promul-
gated, he is pressuring an ally to fur-
ther this Russian propaganda because 
he was referring to this extensively dis-
credited 
conspiracy 
theory 
that 
Ukraine was the one that really hacked 
the DNC—the Democratic National 
Committee—servers in 2016. 
And that reference to CrowdStrike— 
well, that is an American cyber secu-
rity firm. And the theory—this kooky 
conspiracy 
theory—is 
that 
CrowdStrike moved the DNC servers to 
Ukraine to prevent U.S. law enforce-
ment from getting it. 
If Ukraine announced an investiga-
tion into this fabrication, President 
Trump could remove what he perceived 
to be a cloud over his legitimacy—le-
gitimacy of his last election, Russia’s 
assistance with his campaign—and sug-
gest that it was the Democratic Party 
that was the real beneficiary of that. 
On the call, President Trump told 
Zelensky: ‘‘Whatever you can do, it’s 
very important that you do it if that’s 
possible.’’ 
President Zelensky agreed that he 
would do the investigation saying: 
‘‘Yes it is very important for me and 
everything that you just mentioned 
earlier.’’ 
President Trump then turned to his 
second 
request, 
asking 
President 
Zelensky to look into the sham allega-
tion into former Vice President Biden. 
President Trump said to President 
Zelensky: 
The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about 
Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecu-
tion and a lot of people want to find out 
about that so whatever you can do with the 
Attorney General would be great. Biden went 
around bragging that he stopped the prosecu-
tion so if you can look into it . . . It sounds 
horrible to me. 
There is no question what President 
Trump 
intended 
in 
pressing 
the 
Ukrainian leader to ‘‘look into’’ his po-
litical rival. Even after the impeach-
ment inquiry began, he confirmed his 
desire on the south lawn of the White 
House, declaring not only that Ukraine 
should investigate Biden but that 
China should do the same. 
Let’s see what he said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
NEWS REPORTER. What exactly did you 
hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens 
after your phone call? Exactly. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. Well, I would think 
that, if they were honest about it, they’d 
start a major investigation into the Bidens. 
It’s a very simple answer. 
They should investigate the Bidens, be-
cause how does a company that is newly 
formed—and all these companies, if you look 
at— 
And, by the way, likewise, China should 
start an investigation into the Bidens, be-
cause what happened in China is just about 
as bad as what happened with—with Ukraine. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The day after 
that July 25 phone call, President 
Trump sought confirmation that Presi-
dent Zelensky understood his request 
to announce the politically motivated 
investigations and that he would follow 
through. 
After meeting with Ukranian offi-
cials, including President Zelensky and 
his top aide, the President’s hand-
picked Ambassador to the European 
Union, Gordon Sondland, called Presi-
dent Trump from an outdoor res-
taurant in Kyiv to report back. This 
was the second conversation between 
the two about Ukraine in as many 
days. 
David Holmes, an American diplomat 
dining with Sondland, overheard the 
call, including the President’s voice 
through the cell phone. I described part 
of that call last night. 
Holmes 
testified 
that 
President 
Trump asked Sondland: ‘‘So he’s going 
to do the investigation?’’ Sondland re-
plied that he is going to do it, adding 
that President Zelensky will do ‘‘any-
thing you ask him to do.’’ 
After the phone call, Holmes ‘‘took 
the opportunity to ask Ambassador 
Sondland for his candid impression of 
the President’s views on Ukraine.’’ Ac-
cording to Holmes: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. In particular, I asked Am-
bassador Sondland if it was true that the 
President did not give a [expletive] about 
Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed the 
President did not give a [expletive] about 
Ukraine. I asked, why not, and Ambassador 
Sondland stated, the President only cares 
about . . . ‘‘big stuff.’’ I noted there was . . . 
‘‘big stuff’’ going on in Ukraine, like a war 
with Russia. And Ambassador Sondland re-
plied that he meant . . . ‘‘big stuff’’ that 
benefits the President, like the . . . ‘‘Biden 
investigation’’ that Mr. Giuliani was push-
ing. The conversation then moved on to 
other topics. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Those three 
days in July—the 24th, the 25th, and 
the 26th—reveal a lot about President 
Trump’s effort to solicit help from a 
foreign country in assisting his own re-
election. 
On the 24th, Special Counsel Mueller 
testifies that Russia interfered in our 
2016 election to assist the Trump cam-
paign, which knew about the inter-
ference, welcomed it, and utilized it. 
That is the 24th. 
The 25th is the day of the call, when 
President Trump, believing he had es-
caped accountability for Russian med-
dling in the first election and is wel-
coming of it, asked the Ukranian Presi-
dent to help him undermine the special 
counsel’s conclusion and help him 
smear a political opponent, former 
Vice President Biden. 
And then, the third day in a row in 
July, President Trump sought to en-
sure that Ukraine had received his re-
quest and understood it and would take 
the necessary steps to announce the in-
vestigations that he wanted. 
Three days in July. In many ways 
those 3 days in July tell so much of 
this story. This course of conduct alone 
should astound all of us who value the 
sanctity of our elections and who un-
derstand that the vast powers of the 
Presidency are reserved only for ac-
tions which benefit the country as a 
whole, rather than the political for-
tunes of any one individual. 
President Trump’s effort to use an of-
ficial head-of-state phone call to solicit 
the announcement of investigations 
helpful to his reelection is not only 
conduct unbecoming a President, but it 
is conduct of one who believes that the 
powers of his high office are political 
tools to be wielded against his oppo-
nents, including by asking a foreign 
government to investigate a United 
States citizen, and for a corrupt pur-
pose. That alone is grounds for removal 
from office of the 45th President. 
But these 3 days in July were neither 
the beginning nor the end of this 
scheme. 
President 
Trump, 
acting 
through agents inside and outside of 
the U.S. Government, including his 
personal 
attorney, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, 
sought to compel Ukraine to announce 
the investigations by withholding the 
head-of-state meeting in the Oval Of-
fice until the President of Ukraine 
complied. 
Hosting an Oval Office meeting for a 
foreign leader is an official act avail-
able only to one person—the President 
of the United States. And it is an offi-
cial act that President Trump had al-
ready offered to President Zelensky 
during their first phone call on April 21 
and in a subsequent letter to the 
Ukranian leader. 
Multiple witnesses testified about 
the importance of a White House meet-
ing for Ukraine. For example, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary George Kent ex-
plained that a White House meeting 
was ‘‘very important’’ for Ukrainians 
to demonstrate the strength of their 
relationship with ‘‘Ukraine’s strongest 
supporter.’’ 
Dr. Fiona Hill of the National Secu-
rity Council explained that a White 
House meeting would supply the new 
Ukranian Government with ‘‘the legit-
imacy that it needed, especially vis-a- 
vis the Russians’’ and that the Ukrain-
ians viewed a White House meeting as 
‘‘a recognition of their legitimacy as a 
sovereign state.’’ 
This White House meeting would also 
prove to be important for three hand-
picked agents whom President Trump

S450 
January 22, 2020 
placed in charge of U.S.-Ukraine issues: 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Ambassador 
Volker, and Energy Secretary Rick 
Perry, the so-called three amigos. They 
hoped to convince President Trump to 
hold an Oval Office meeting with 
Zelensky. 
During a meeting of the three amigos 
on May 23, President Trump told them 
that Ukraine had tried to ‘‘take [him] 
down’’ in 2016. He then directed them 
to ‘‘talk to Rudy’’ Giuliani about 
Ukraine. 
It 
was 
immediately 
clear 
that 
Giuliani, who was pursuing the discred-
ited investigations in Ukraine on the 
President’s behalf, was the key to 
unlocking an Oval Office meeting for 
President Zelensky. 
Giuliani by then had said publicly 
that he was actively pursuing inves-
tigations President Trump corruptly 
desired and planning a trip to Ukraine. 
Giuliani admitted: ‘‘We’re not med-
dling in an election, we’re meddling in 
an investigation.’’ 
On May 10, however, Giuliani can-
celed the trip to Ukraine to dig up dirt 
on former Vice President Biden and the 
2016 conspiracy theory, just as Presi-
dent Zelensky won elections for the 
Presidency and Parliament. 
Faced with a choice between working 
with Giuliani to pursue an Oval Office 
meeting—understanding it meant tak-
ing part in a corrupt effort to secure 
the political investigations—or aban-
doning efforts to support our Ukranian 
ally, the President’s agents fell into 
line. They would pursue the White 
House meeting and explain to Ukraine 
that announcement of the investiga-
tions was the price of admission. 
As Ambassador Sondland made clear: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SONDLAND. I know that members of 
this committee frequently frame these com-
plicated issues in the form of a simple ques-
tion: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified 
previously with regard to the requested 
White House call and the White House meet-
ing, the answer is yes. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This quid pro 
quo was negotiated between the Presi-
dent’s 
agents, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, 
and 
Ukranian officials throughout the sum-
mer of 2019 in numerous telephone 
calls, text messages, and meetings, in-
cluding during a meeting hosted by 
then-National Security Advisor John 
Bolton on July 10. 
Near the end of that July 10 meeting, 
after the Ukrainians again raised the 
issue of a White House visit, Ambas-
sador Sondland blurted out that there 
would be agreement for a White House 
meeting once the investigations began. 
At that point Bolton ‘‘immediately 
stiffened’’ and abruptly ended the 
meeting. 
During a subsequent discussion that 
day, Sondland was even more explicit. 
LTC Alex Vindman, a director for Eu-
rope and Ukraine on the National Se-
curity Council, testified that Sondland 
began to discuss the ‘‘deliverable’’ re-
quired to get the White House meeting. 
What Sondland specifically mentioned 
was ‘‘investigation of the Bidens.’’ This 
is, again, in that meeting in the White 
House with a Ukranian delegation and 
an American delegation. Sondland ex-
plained in that meeting that he had an 
agreement with Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick 
Mulvaney 
whereby 
President 
Zelensky would be granted the Oval Of-
fice meeting if he went forward with 
the investigations. 
After the meeting, Vindman’s super-
visor, Dr. Hill, reported back to Bolton, 
who told her to tell John Eisenberg, 
the National Security Council legal ad-
visor, that he was not ‘‘part of what-
ever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney 
are cooking up on this.’’ She reported 
their concerns, as did Vindman. 
It remains unclear what action, if 
any, Bolton or Eisenberg took once 
they were made aware of Mulvaney and 
Sondland’s drug deal. Both refused to 
testify in our inquiry. However, Dr. 
Hill testified that she understood that 
Mr. Eisenberg informed Mr. Cipollone 
of her concerns about the drug deal. 
If this body is serious about a fair 
trial—one that is fair to the President 
and to the American people—we again 
urge you to allow the House to call 
both Eisenberg and Bolton, as well as 
other key witnesses with firsthand 
knowledge who refused to testify be-
fore the House on the orders of the 
President. 
Additional testimony and documents 
are particularly important because, ac-
cording to Sondland, ‘‘Everyone was in 
the loop’’ when it came to the Presi-
dent’s self-serving effort. In part rely-
ing on email excerpts, Sondland ex-
plained that the President’s senior 
aides and Cabinet officials knew that 
the White House meeting was predi-
cated on Ukraine’s announcement of 
the investigations beneficial to the 
President’s political campaign. 
Hill characterized the quid pro quo 
succinctly: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
But it struck me when yesterday, when 
you put up on the screen Ambassador 
Sondland’s emails and who was on these 
emails, and he said, These are the people who 
need to know, that he was absolutely right. 
Because he was being involved in a domestic 
political errand, and we were being involved 
in national security foreign policy, and those 
two things had just diverged. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In effect, 
President Zelensky was being drawn 
into this domestic political area. He 
grew wary of becoming involved in an-
other country’s election and domestic 
affairs. 
Bill Taylor, the Acting U.S. Ambas-
sador for Ukraine at the time, de-
scribed a conversation he had with a 
senior aide to the Ukrainian leader. He 
said: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
[Also] on July 20, I had a phone conversa-
tion with Oleksandr Danylyuk, President 
Zelensky’s national security advisor, who 
emphasized that President Zelensky did not 
want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. 
reelection campaign. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Remember 
that conversation when you hear coun-
sel say that the Ukrainians felt no 
pressure to be involved in a U.S. reelec-
tion campaign. But that concern did 
not deter President Trump. In his con-
versation with Sondland shortly before 
the July 25 call, the President made 
clear that he not only wanted Ukraine 
to do the investigations or announce 
them, but also a White House meeting 
would be scheduled only if President 
Zelensky confirmed these investiga-
tions, as Volker communicated to 
President Zelensky’s top aide by text 
less than 30 minutes before the phone 
call between Trump and Zelensky. 
Again, we are talking about July 25, 
in a text 30 minutes before the Trump- 
Zelensky phone call. Here is what it 
says—with 
Volker 
texting 
Andriy 
Yermak, 
a 
top 
aide 
to 
President 
Zelensky. 
Good lunch—thanks. Heard from White 
House—assuming 
President 
Z 
convinces 
trump he will investigate/‘‘get to the bottom 
of what happened’’ in 2016, we will nail down 
day for visit to Washington. Good luck! See 
you tomorrow—kurt. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, those 
words couldn’t be much clearer: ‘‘as-
suming President Z convinces trump he 
will investigate/‘get to the bottom of 
what happened’ in 2016, we will nail 
down [the] . . . visit to Washington.’’ 
That is a text 30 minutes before that 
call. 
Counsel for the President would like 
you to think this is just about that 
call. You don’t get to look outside the 
four corners of that call. They don’t 
want you to look at the months that 
went into preparing for that call or the 
months of pressure that followed. But 
you can just look at, right now, what 
happened 30 minutes before that call in 
this text message: ‘‘Heard from White 
House—assuming 
President 
Z 
con-
vinces trump he will investigate/‘get to 
the bottom of what happened’ in 2016.’’ 
If you were wondering whether Presi-
dent Zelensky was aware of what he 
was going to be asked on that call, this 
is how you can tell. He was prepped. Of 
course he was prepped. In fact, the 
missing reference in the call record to 
Burisma was a signal Colonel Vindman 
recognized that clearly he had been 
prepped for that call. Why else would 
the name of this particular energy 
company come up in that conversa-
tion? 
Well, President Zelensky clearly got 
the message. Toward the end of the call 
with 
President 
Trump, 
President 
Zelensky said: 
I also wanted to thank you for your invita-
tion to visit the United States, specifically 
Washington DC. On the other hand, I also 
wanted to ensure you that we will be very se-
rious about the case and will work on the in-
vestigation.’’ 
Thank you for the invitation. On the 
other hand, I want to assure you that 
we will be very serious about the case, 
and we will work on the investigation. 
President Zelensky clearly under-
stood the quid pro quo for the White 
House meeting on July 25, but his reti-
cence to be used as a political pawn

S451 
January 22, 2020 
kept President Trump from moving 
forward with a promise to schedule the 
meeting, and so the President and his 
agents pressed on. 
In August, Giuliani met with a top 
Ukrainian aide and made it clear that 
Ukraine must issue a public statement 
and announce investigations in order 
to get a White House meeting. Fearful 
of getting involved in U.S. domestic 
politics and having entered office with 
a promise to clean up government and 
corruption, President Zelensky and his 
aides preferred a generic statement 
about investigations, but Giuliani in-
sisted. No, the statement must include 
two specific investigations that would 
benefit President Trump. 
Let’s look at a comparison between 
the statement the Ukrainians preferred 
and the one that Giuliani required. 
On the left—and I will read it in case 
you can’t see the screens—the Yermak 
draft, the Ukrainian draft, says: ‘‘We 
intend to initiate and complete a 
transparent and unbiased investigation 
of all available facts and episodes, 
which in turn will prevent the recur-
rence of this problem in the future.’’ 
That is pretty generic. 
But here is the Giuliani-Volker- 
Sondland response. This is what had to 
be included: ‘‘We intend to initiate and 
complete a transparent and unbiased 
investigation of all available facts and 
episodes.’’ Up to that point, it is ex-
actly the same, until you get to ‘‘in-
cluding those involving Burisma and 
the 2016 US elections,’’ and then it goes 
back to the Ukrainian draft: ‘‘which in 
turn will prevent the recurrence of this 
problem in the future.’’ 
You can see in this such graphic evi-
dence that the Ukrainians did not want 
to do this. They didn’t even want to 
mention this. Giuliani had to insist: 
No, no, no; we are not going to be satis-
fied with some generic statement. 
After all, I think we can see this isn’t 
about corruption—no, this is about an-
nouncing 
investigations 
to 
damage 
Biden and to promote this fiction 
about the last election. 
So here in these texts, you see that 
Giuliani, Volker, and Sondland have 
added these references to Burisma—a 
thinly-veiled reference to former Vice 
President Biden—and the 2016 election. 
They wished to ensure that the Ukrain-
ians mentioned the sham investigation 
President Trump required. 
The Ukrainians recoiled at the new 
statement, recognizing that releasing 
it would run directly counter to the 
anti-corruption platform that Zelensky 
campaigned on and would embroil 
them in U.S. election politics. As a re-
sult, Zelensky didn’t get his White 
House meeting. He still hasn’t gotten 
his White House meeting. 
Senators, witness testimony, text 
messages, emails, and the call record 
itself confirm a corrupt quid pro quo 
for the White House meeting—an offi-
cial act available only to the President 
of the United States—in exchange for 
the announcement of political inves-
tigations. The President and his allies 
have offered no explanation for this ef-
fort—except that the President can 
abuse his office all he likes, and there 
is nothing you can do about it. You 
can’t indict him. You can’t impeach 
him. That is because they cannot seri-
ously dispute that President Trump 
corruptly used an official White House 
visit for a foreign leader to compel the 
Ukrainian President into helping him 
cheat in the next election. 
The White House meeting, of course, 
was not the only official act that Presi-
dent Trump conditioned on the an-
nouncement 
of 
investigations 
into 
Biden and the conspiracy theory meant 
to exonerate President Trump on Rus-
sia’s interference on his behalf in the 
last election. In a far more draconian 
step, as we discussed, the President 
withheld $391 million of military aid. 
Several weeks before this phone call 
with President Zelensky but after 
Giuliani was already pressing Ukrain-
ian officials to conduct the investiga-
tions 
his 
client 
sought, 
President 
Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine’s 
military aid. Significantly, this was 
after Congress had already been noti-
fied that most of it was prepared to be 
spent. Ukraine had met all of the crit-
ical conditions for anti-corruption and 
defense reforms in order to receive the 
funds. We conditioned the funds. They 
met the conditions. The funds were 
ready to go. 
At the time and even today, wit-
nesses uniformly testified that the 
order to hold the funding came without 
explanation to the foreign policy and 
national security officials responsible 
for Ukraine. The only message from 
the Office of Management and Budget 
was that the hold was implemented at 
the direction of the President. 
Since Russia’s illegal incursion into 
Ukraine in 2014, the United States has 
maintained a bipartisan policy of deliv-
ering hundreds of millions of dollars of 
military aid to Ukraine each year, 
which several Senators here have per-
sonally invested significant time and 
effort to ensure. It was President 
Trump himself who originally author-
ized additional financial support for 
military assistance to Ukraine in 2017 
and 2018 without reservation, making 
his abrupt decision to withhold assist-
ance in 2019 without explanation all 
the more surprising to those respon-
sible for Ukraine policy. 
That confusion, however, would soon 
disappear. The President used the hold 
on military aid as leverage to pressure 
Ukraine to announce these investiga-
tions that he hoped would help his re-
election campaign. The only difference 
between the prior years when the 
President approved the aid without 
question and the inexplicable hold on 
aid in 2019 was the emergence of Joe 
Biden as a potentially formidable ob-
stacle to the President’s reelection. 
These funds that the President with-
held—these funds—they don’t just ben-
efit Ukraine; they benefit the security 
of the United States by ensuring that 
Ukraine is equipped to defend its own 
borders against Russian aggression. 
As Ambassador Taylor noted in his 
deposition, the United States provides 
Ukraine with ‘‘radar and weapons and 
sniper rifles, communications that save 
lives. It makes Ukrainians more effec-
tive. It might even shorten the war. 
That is what our hope is, to show the 
Ukrainians can defend themselves—and 
the Russians, in the end, will say: OK, 
we are going to stop.’’ That is in our 
interest. This isn’t just about Ukraine 
or its national security; it is about our 
national security. This isn’t charity; it 
is about our defense as much as 
Ukraine’s. 
Ambassador Taylor also said that the 
American aid was ‘‘a concrete dem-
onstration of the United States’ com-
mitment to resist aggression and de-
fend freedom.’’ This is what this coun-
try is supposed to be about, right? Re-
sisting aggression, defending freedom, 
not exporting corrupt ideas—that is 
what we are supposed to be about, 
right? 
It was against this backdrop that 
American 
officials 
responsible 
for 
Ukraine policy sat in astonishment, ac-
cording to Ambassador Taylor, when 
they learned about the hold. Officials 
immediately expressed concerns about 
the legality of President Trump’s hold 
on the assistance to Ukraine. Their 
concerns were well warranted, as the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office, 
which was just last night pooh-poohed 
by the President’s counsel—well, that 
is just some institution of Congress. 
Like they are just going to be inher-
ently biased, right? Well, they are a 
nonpartisan organization that both 
parties have come to rely upon. But I 
am not surprised that they don’t like 
the conclusion of the GAO, because the 
Defense Department warned them that 
this was going to be the conclusion, 
and that conclusion was that the hold 
on aid was not only wrong, it was not 
only immoral, it was also illegal. It 
violated the law—a law that we passed 
so that Presidents could not refuse to 
spend money that we allocated for the 
defense of others and for ourselves. 
The Impoundment Control Act pre-
vents the President and other govern-
ment officials from unilaterally mak-
ing funding decisions when Congress 
has made its intent clear. In fact, the 
act exists precisely because of previous 
Presidential abuses of Congress’s power 
of the purse during the Nixon era. The 
nonpartisan GAO ruled that the hold 
on military aid was not only illegal but 
that holding underscores the Presi-
dent’s efforts to go to any lengths to 
ensure his own personal benefit rather 
than take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed as he swore he would do 
when he took his oath of office. 
Now, because of recent Freedom of 
Information Act responses in media re-
ports, we now know additional details 
about how senior officials expressed se-
rious reservations about the legality of 
the hold at the time. This is not like 
some big surprise. This is not like 
something that just came out of the 
blue—whoa, an independent watchdog

agency found this was illegal. No, they 
knew this was illegal at the time. 
These concerns were raised at the time. 
Certain individuals who may have 
further information about the hold who 
refused to testify at the President’s di-
rection—including his Chief of Staff, 
Mick Mulvaney; Robert Blair; OMB of-
ficial Michael Duffey, all of them—all 
of them defied congressional subpoenas 
but were included in important email 
communications that have been made 
public only recently. 
As you know, these and many other 
categories 
of 
documents 
from 
the 
White House, the Defense Department, 
and OMB were subpoenaed by the 
House and none was produced—none— 
at 
the 
President’s 
direction 
and 
through Mr. Cipollone’s intervention. 
Although the investigation developed 
an overwhelming body of evidence that 
clearly proves that the President im-
plemented 
this 
hold 
to 
pressure 
Ukraine to announce investigations, 
the full story behind the hold—the full 
and complete story—is within your 
power to request. 
As you consider the evidence we 
present to you, ask yourselves whether 
the documents of witnesses that have 
been denied by the President’s com-
plete and unprecedented obstruction 
could shed more light on this critical 
topic. You may agree with the House 
managers that the evidence of the 
President’s withholding of military aid 
to coerce Ukraine is already supported 
by overwhelming evidence and no fur-
ther insight is necessary to convict the 
President, but if the President’s law-
yers attempt to contest these or other 
factual matters, you are left with no 
choice but to demand to hear from 
each witness with firsthand knowledge. 
A fair trial requires nothing less. 
Let’s look at some of the evidence 
that we gathered, notwithstanding this 
obstruction. 
First, the President withheld the aid 
without explanation and against the 
advice of his own agencies, Cabinet of-
ficials, national security experts, in-
cluding Secretary Pompeo, Secretary 
Esper, Ambassador Bolton, and others. 
Only Mick Mulvaney, a central figure 
in this effort, reportedly supported the 
hold, and he told us why. During a 
press briefing, Mulvaney personally ac-
knowledged that the hold was ordered 
as part of a quid pro quo designed to 
get Ukraine to undertake the inves-
tigation President Trump signed. 
Second, the reason for the security 
assistance hold was undoubtedly on the 
President’s mind during the telephone 
call with President Zelensky on July 
25. Near the beginning of their con-
versation, 
President 
Zelensky 
ex-
pressed his gratitude for U.S. military 
assistance, noting the United States’ 
‘‘great support in the area of defense.’’ 
Immediately 
after 
President 
Zelensky’s reference to defense and 
military support, President Trump re-
sponded by saying: ‘‘I would like you to 
do us a favor, though, because our 
country has been through a lot, and 
Ukraine knows a lot about it.’’ Presi-
dent Trump then proceeded to openly 
press Ukraine to conduct these inves-
tigations. 
Third, numerous officials were aware 
that President Trump was withholding 
the White House meeting until the 
Ukrainian President announced the in-
vestigations. That the President would 
ratchet up pressure on Ukraine to com-
pel its action stunned Ukraine experts 
like Ambassador Taylor but followed 
logically for those engaged in the 
President’s corrupt scheme. 
Fourth, by the end of August, there 
was still no explanation for the hold, 
despite ongoing efforts from numerous 
officials to persuade the President to 
release the money. The leverage of the 
White House meeting had not suc-
ceeded in coercing Ukraine to an-
nounce the investigations, providing 
the President and his agents every rea-
son to use the most aggressive lever of 
influence, hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in military support, to compel 
Ukraine to act. If they didn’t feel pres-
sure, they wouldn’t have done it. They 
wouldn’t have done it, but of course 
they did. 
Imagine if this country were depend-
ent on a more powerful country for our 
defense; imagine if we were at war; 
imagine if we were waiting for weapons 
to defend ourselves, something our 
Framers could have understood; imag-
ine that we found ourselves in those 
circumstances, and much to our aston-
ishment, we couldn’t even get a meet-
ing with our ally, much to our aston-
ishment, they were withholding aid 
from us. Would you think we would feel 
pressure? Of course we would. The 
Framers had common sense, and so 
must we. 
Are we to accept: Well, the President 
said there was no quid pro quo; I guess 
that closes the case? In every court-
room in America, jurors—and I know 
you are not just jurors. I led the Clin-
ton trial. You are jurors and judges. 
Jurors all over America are told: You 
don’t leave your common sense at the 
door. Well, we don’t have to leave our 
common sense at the door here too. 
Two plus two equals four. 
The aid was withheld. You are asking 
for it. We are asking for it. His own 
aides are asking for it, and no one can 
get an explanation. The Ukrainians 
can’t get an explanation. All the 
Ukrainians get is: We want you to do 
these investigations. They are prom-
ised a White House meeting. They want 
a White House meeting. They need a 
White House meeting. They are going 
to be going into negotiations with 
Putin. They want to show strength, 
and they can’t get in the door. They 
see the Russian Foreign Minister get in 
the door of the White House. We see 
the photos of the President and the 
Russian Foreign Minister, or the Am-
bassador, what a great time they are 
having, but, no, the President of 
Ukraine, our ally, can’t get in the door. 
They are not stupid. They know what 
is going on here. They are not stupid. 
Remember that conversation I ref-
erenced yesterday when the Ukrainians 
threw it right back in our face—when 
Ambassador Volker said to his Ukrain-
ian counterpart: You shouldn’t inves-
tigate 
the 
former 
President. 
You 
shouldn’t engage in those political in-
vestigations. The Ukrainian response 
was: You mean like the one you want 
us to do on the Bidens and the Clin-
tons? They are not stupid. 
By the end of August, there was still 
no explanation for the hold, despite ef-
forts by numerous people to seek the 
release of the funding. The leverage 
hadn’t succeeded in getting the Presi-
dent to—in coercing Ukraine to an-
nounce the investigations, and so the 
aid was withheld. Two witnesses privy 
to this scheme testified that the only 
logical conclusion to reach about the 
President’s continued hold on the aid 
was that it was intended to put more 
pressure on Ukraine to announce the 
investigations. As I said, they testified 
it was as simple as two plus two equals 
four. 
We can do math, and, more impor-
tantly, so can the Ukrainians, and 
maybe even more importantly than 
that, so can the Russians. Multiple sen-
ior 
officials, 
including 
President 
Trump himself, have confirmed this 
logical conclusion. On September 7, 
Ambassador Sondland spoke directly to 
President Trump, who by that point 
was aware that a whistleblower com-
plaint was circulating that alleged the 
contours of his scheme and that Con-
gress and the public were beginning to 
ask probing questions about the hold 
on aid, including whether the with-
holding of the aid was in exchange for 
reelection help. 
During that call of September 7—so 
in July you have got Mueller’s testi-
mony. You have got the call itself. You 
have got a followup call the next day, 
where the President is speaking to 
Sondland and wants to make sure they 
are going to do the investigations. You 
have got August, where they are trying 
to hammer out a statement, and the 
Ukrainians are still resisting. 
Then you have September. On Sep-
tember 7, Ambassador Sondland is on 
the phone with President Trump. At 
that point, he is aware that a whistle-
blower has filed a complaint alleging 
the contours of this scheme and Con-
gress and the public are beginning to 
ask questions about the hold on aid, in-
cluding whether this was to get help in 
his reelection. 
During this call between the Presi-
dent and Ambassador Sondland, with-
out a prompt, President Trump told 
Sondland: There is no quid pro quo. 
Now, why would he do that? That is 
not something that comes up in normal 
conversation, right? Hello, Mr. Presi-
dent, how are you today? No quid pro 
quo. 
That is the kind of thing that comes 
up in a conversation if you are trying 
to put your alibi out there. If you 
heard about a whistleblower complaint, 
if you had seen allegations, if you

know Congress is starting to sniff 
around, no quid pro quo. But—and I 
know this is astonishing—so much of 
the last 3 years has been a combination 
of shock and yet no surprise. Yet, even 
while the President is saying no quid 
pro quo, what does he say? Zelensky 
must publicly announce the two polit-
ical investigations, and he should want 
to do it. No quid pro quo, except this 
quid pro quo. 
Sondland immediately relayed the 
message to President Zelensky, in-
forming him that without the an-
nouncement of the political investiga-
tions, they would be at a stalemate. 
Sondland made clear that this ref-
erence to a stalemate meant the re-
lease of the security assistance. 
President Zelensky, after hesitating 
for weeks to join the President’s cor-
rupt scheme, finally relented. Presi-
dent Zelensky informed Sondland that 
he agreed to do a CNN interview, and 
Sondland understood that he would use 
that occasion to mention these items, 
meaning the two investigations at the 
heart of the scheme. 
Candidate Zelensky, who was swept 
into office with a landslide victory on a 
promise of fighting corruption, would 
be forced to undertake just the same 
kind of corrupt act he had been elected 
to clean up. Upon learning this, Am-
bassador Taylor called Sondland to 
register his deep concern, telling him 
that it was crazy—crazy. Taylor later 
texted Sondland to reinforce the point: 
‘‘As I said on the phone, I think it’s 
crazy to withhold security assistance 
for help with a political campaign.’’ 
‘‘As I said on the phone’’—clearly, 
they had discussed it. ‘‘As I said on the 
phone.’’ 
Taylor testified about the message 
and the events leading up to it. Taylor 
said that security assistance was so 
important for Ukraine, as well as our 
own national interest. To withhold 
that assistance for no good reason 
other than help with the political cam-
paign made no sense. It was counter-
productive to all of what we had been 
trying to do. It was illogical. It could 
not be explained. It was crazy. 
What is more, Ambassador Taylor 
also came to learn that President 
Trump wanted Zelensky in a public 
box. 
He testified—Mr. Goldman was ask-
ing the question: ‘‘Now, you reference a 
television interview and a desire for 
President Trump to put Zelensky in a 
public box, which you also have in 
quotes.’’ 
Now, this is in reference, I think, to 
his written testimony. 
‘‘Was that reference to ‘in a public 
box’ in his notes?’’ 
You 
remember 
he 
kept 
detailed 
notes. 
Taylor’s answer: ‘‘It was in my 
notes.’’ 
‘‘And what did you understand that 
to mean, to put Zelensky in a public 
box’’? 
And Taylor responds: ‘‘I understood 
that to mean that President Trump, 
through Ambassador Sondland, was 
asking for President Zelensky to pub-
licly commit to these investigations, 
that it was not sufficient to do this in 
private, that this needed to be a very 
public statement.’’ 
So we saw earlier, the side-by-side 
comparison, right, of what the Ukrain-
ians wanted to say. They wanted to 
make no mention of these specific in-
vestigations, and now Giuliani insisted: 
No, no, no. This isn’t going to be cred-
ible unless you mention these specific 
investigations. This is what it is going 
to take. And now you see that Ambas-
sador Sondland has acknowledged to 
Ambassador Taylor that it is not 
enough to use even the right language, 
apparently. It has to be done in public. 
We are not going to take any private 
commitment. It has got to be done in 
public. 
As we would later come to under-
stand, this is because President Trump 
didn’t care about the investigations 
being done. He just wanted them an-
nounced. He wanted Zelensky in a pub-
lic box. He wanted it announced pub-
licly. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
also 
testified 
that he understood from Sondland that 
because Trump was a businessman, he 
would expect to get something in re-
turn before signing a check. 
(Text of Videotape presentation.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. During our meeting, during 
our 
call 
on 
September 
8, 
Ambassador 
Sondland tried to explain to me that Presi-
dent Trump is a businessman. When a busi-
nessman is about to sign a check to someone 
who owes him something, the businessman 
asks that person to pay up before signing the 
check. Ambassador Volker used the same 
language several days later while we were to-
gether at the Yalta European strategy con-
ference. I argued to both that the expla-
nation made no sense. Ukrainians did not 
owe President Trump anything. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is very 
telling. Ambassador Taylor, a Vietnam 
veteran, a West Point graduate, said 
that Ukrainians didn’t owe us any-
thing. Clearly, Donald Trump felt 
Ukrainians owed him, right? 
This is not about Ukraine’s national 
security. It is not about our national 
security. It is not about corruption. 
No, it is about what is in it for me. 
Those Ukrainians owe me before I sign 
a check. 
And, by the way, that is not his 
money. That is your money. That is 
the American people’s money for their 
defense. 
But 
here 
we 
see 
Ambassador 
Sondland explain: No, President Trump 
is a businessman. Before he even signs 
a check, he wants to get something, 
and, of course, that something he was 
going to sign that check for or he was 
going to make that payment for, with 
our tax dollars—that thing that he was 
going to buy with those tax dollars— 
was a smear of his opponent and an ef-
fort to lift whatever cloud he felt was 
over his Presidency because of the Rus-
sian interference on his behalf in the 
last election. 
The President has offered an assort-
ment of shifting explanations after the 
fact for the hold on aid, including that 
he withheld the money because of cor-
ruption in Ukraine or concerns about 
burden-sharing with other European 
countries. But those arguments are 
completely without merit. 
First, the President’s own adminis-
tration had determined by the time of 
the hold that Ukraine had undertaken 
all necessary anti-corruption and de-
fense reforms in order to receive the 
funds. The Defense Department and 
State Department officials repeatedly 
made this clear as the hold remained 
and threatened the ability of the agen-
cy to spend the money before the end 
of the fiscal year. 
Second, the evidence revealed that 
the President only asked about the for-
eign contributions to Ukraine in Sep-
tember, nearly 2 months after the 
President implemented the hold and as 
it became clear that the public, Con-
gress, and a whistleblower were becom-
ing aware of the President’s scheme. 
The after-the-fact effort to come up 
with a justification also belies the 
truth. The European countries provide 
far more financial support to Ukraine 
than the United States. Their support 
is largely economic. Ours also includes 
a lot of military support, but Europe is 
a 
substantial 
financial 
backer 
of 
Ukraine. 
There is something else remarkable 
about this that I was struck by yester-
day as we were going through the im-
portance of the witness testimony and 
looking at some of those redacted 
emails in which the administration 
sought to hide its misconduct. 
In those redactions, when we got to 
see what was beneath them, there was 
an indication that this is very close- 
hold. This is a need-to-know basis only. 
Do you remember that? We will show 
you that again, but it is one of those 
emails that only came to light, I be-
lieve, recently, and it is not because 
the administration wanted you to see 
this information. We see there is a de-
sire not to let people know about this 
hold. 
If the President were fighting corrup-
tion, if he wanted Europeans to pay 
more, why would he hide it from us? 
Why would he hide it from the Ukrain-
ians? Why would he hide it from the 
rest of the world? If this were a desire 
for Europe to pay more, why wouldn’t 
he charge Sondland to go ask Europe 
for more? Why wouldn’t he be proud to 
tell the Congress of the United States: 
I am holding up this aid, and I am hold-
ing it up because I am holding up cor-
ruption? 
Why wouldn’t he? Because, of course, 
it wasn’t true. There is no evidence of 
that. 
And, once more, the White House ad-
mitted why the President held up the 
money. The President’s own Chief of 
Staff explained precisely why during 
the October 17 press conference. Let’s 
see, again, what he had to say. 
(Text of Videotape presentation.) 
Mr. MULVANEY. That was—those were 
the driving factors. Did he also mention to

me in the past that the corruption related to 
the DNC server? Absolutely. No question 
about that. But that’s it. That’s why we held 
up the money. Now, there was a report— 
Mr. KARL. So the demand for an investiga-
tion into the Democrats was part of the rea-
son that he went on to withhold funding to 
Ukraine? 
Mr. MULVANEY. The look-back to what 
happened in 2016 certainly was part of the 
thing that he was worried about in corrup-
tion with that nation and absolutely appro-
priate. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. But Mulvaney 
didn’t just admit that the President 
withheld the crucial aid appropriated 
by Congress to apply pressure on 
Ukraine to do the President’s political 
dirty work. He also said that we should 
just ‘‘get over it.’’ Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation.) 
Mr. KARL. Let’s be clear. What you just 
described is a quid pro quo. It is funding will 
not flow unless the investigation into the 
Democratic server happened as well. 
Mr. MULVANEY. We do that all the time 
with foreign policy. If you read the news re-
ports 
and 
you 
believe 
them—what 
did 
McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney 
said yesterday that he was really upset with 
the political influence in foreign policy. 
That was one of the reasons he was so upset 
about this. And I have news for everybody: 
Get over it. There’s going to be political in-
fluence in foreign policy. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Should the 
Congress just get over it? Should the 
American people just come to expect 
that our Presidents will corruptly 
abuse their office to seek the help of a 
foreign power to cheat in our election? 
Should we just get over it? Is that what 
we have come to? I hope and pray that 
the answer is no. 
We cannot allow a President to with-
hold military aid from an ally or to 
elicit help in a reelection campaign. I 
hope that we don’t have to just get 
over that. I hope that we just don’t 
have to get accustomed to that. 
Is that what we want to tell our con-
stituents, that, yes, the President 
withheld aid from an ally? Yes, it dam-
aged our national security. And, yes, 
he wouldn’t meet with the foreign lead-
ers important to us unless he got help 
in the next election. And, yes, it is 
wrong to try to get a foreign power to 
help. 
It is kind of cheating, really, if we 
are going to be honest about it and bla-
tant about it. It is cheating. Americans 
are supposed to decide American elec-
tions, but, you know, I guess we just 
need to get over it. I guess that is just 
what we should now expect of a Presi-
dent of the United States. 
I guess there is really no remedy for 
that 
anymore. 
The 
impeachment, 
maybe that was a good idea 200 years 
ago, but I guess we just need to get 
over it. I guess maybe the President 
really is above the law because they 
say you can’t indict the President. 
The President says you can’t even in-
vestigate the President. The President 
is in court saying, you can not only not 
indict the President, you can’t even in-
vestigate the President. The Attorney 
General’s position is that you can’t 
even investigate the President. 
Are we really prepared to say that? 
The only answer to the President’s 
misconduct is that we need to get over 
it? What are we to say to the next 
President? What are we to say to the 
President who is from a different 
party, who refuses the same kind of 
subpoenas, and the President says to 
you or his Chief of Staff says to you or 
her Chief of Staff says to you: Just get 
over it. I am not doing anything dif-
ferent than Donald Trump did. Just get 
over it. He asked for help in the next 
election, I am asking for help in the 
next election. Just get over it. We do 
this kind of thing all the time. 
People are cynical enough as it is 
about politics, about people’s commit-
ment to their good, cynical enough 
without having us confirm it for them. 
I think it is more than crazy. Those 
were Ambassador Taylor’s words. I 
think it is more than crazy. I think it 
is a gross abuse of power. 
And I don’t think that impeachment 
power is a relic. If it is a relic, I wonder 
how much longer our Republic can suc-
ceed. 
For months, President Trump and his 
agents had pressured Ukraine to an-
nounce investigations, and President 
Zelensky finally yielded. As previously 
noted, he scheduled a CNN interview 
and planned to publicly announce the 
politically motivated investigations. 
He informed Sondland of this plan 
during a September 7 phone call. In the 
same call, Sondland related to Presi-
dent Zelensky that Trump required 
that the Ukrainian leader make the 
public announcement in order to get 
the critical military aid. 
President Trump’s corruption had fi-
nally worn down President Zelensky, 
overcoming his effort to remain true to 
his 
anti-corruption 
platform—until 
events intervened. 
Before Zelensky could do the inter-
view, President Trump learned that his 
scheme had been exposed. Facing pub-
lic and congressional pressure on Sep-
tember 11, the President finally re-
leased the hold on aid to Ukraine. Just 
like the implementation of the hold, he 
provided no reason for the release, but 
the reason is quite simple. The Presi-
dent got caught. 
In late August, President Trump 
learned about a whistleblower com-
plaint 
that 
was 
winding 
its 
way 
through the intelligence agencies on 
its way to Congress. 
On September 9, three House com-
mittees announced an investigation 
into President Trump’s Ukraine mis-
conduct and that of his proxy, Rudy 
Giuliani. Later that day, again, Sep-
tember 9, the intelligence community 
inspector general notified the Senate 
and House Intelligence Committees of 
the existence of the complaint and the 
fact that it was being withheld from 
Congress, contrary to law and in an un-
precedented fashion. 
Facing significant public pressure on 
September 11, the President gave up 
and released the money to Ukraine. 
One week later, President Zelensky 
canceled the CNN interview. 
And rather than demonstrate attri-
tion or acknowledged wrongdoing, the 
President instead has continued his ef-
fort, even after the impeachment in-
vestigation began. He not only contin-
ued to call on Ukraine to investigate 
his political opponent, he called on 
China to do the same. 
This should concern all of us. It is a 
confirmation not only of the scheme to 
pressure Ukraine to help his political 
campaign but a clear sign that the 
President believes that these corrupt 
acts are acceptable. 
A President this unapologetic, this 
unbound to the Constitution and the 
oath of office, must be removed from 
that office lest he continue to use the 
vast prejudicial powers at his disposal 
to seek advantage in the next election. 
President Trump’s abuse of powers of 
his office undermined the integrity of 
our free and fair elections and com-
promised America’s national security. 
If we don’t stand up to this peril 
today, we will write the history of our 
decline with our own hand. If President 
Trump is not held to account, we send 
a message to future Presidents, future 
Congresses, and generations of Ameri-
cans that the personal interests of the 
President can fairly take precedent 
over those of the Nation. The domestic 
effects of this descent from democracy 
will be a weakened trust in the integ-
rity of our elections and the rule of law 
and a steady decline of the spread of 
democratic 
values 
throughout 
the 
world. 
For how can any country trust the 
United States as a model of governance 
if it is one that sanctions precisely the 
political corruption and invitation to 
foreign meddling that we have long 
sought to help eradicate in burgeoning 
democracies around the world? To pro-
tect against foreign interference in our 
elections, we have guardrails built into 
our democratic system. We have cam-
paign finance laws to ensure that polit-
ical assistance can come only from do-
mestic actors, and we take seriously 
the need to shore up the integrity of 
our voting systems so that a foreign 
government or actor cannot change 
vote tallies. The promise of one person, 
one vote is only effective if each vote is 
cast free of foreign interference. Amer-
icans decide American elections—at 
least they should. 
Now, what if electoral corruption is 
even more insidious? What happens 
when the invitation comes from with-
in? 
Our 
Framers 
understood 
that 
threat too. George Mason noted at the 
Constitutional Convention that im-
peachment was a necessary tool be-
cause ‘‘the man who has practiced cor-
ruption and by that means procured his 
appointment in the first instance’’ 
could seek to repeat his guilt. 
In June of last year, President 
Trump was clear that, if a foreign gov-
ernment offered dirt on his political 
opponent, he would take it, a state-
ment deeply at odds with the guidance 
provided at the time by his own FBI 
Director, the former Federal Election

Commission Chair, and our Constitu-
tion, written some 233 years ago. In no 
uncertain terms, it admonishes against 
any person holding office of profit or 
trust accepting any present from any 
foreign state. 
But President Trump did more than 
take the foreign help in 2019, as he had 
done in 2016. This time, he had not only 
asked for it in the July 25 call, but 
when he didn’t get the help from the 
Ukrainian President in the form of an-
nounced investigations, he withheld 
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-
payer-funded military aid and a cov-
eted White House meeting to increase 
the pressure on Ukraine to comply. 
Later, he demonstrated no remorse and 
continued to encourage Ukraine to 
conduct the political investigations he 
wanted, even asking other countries to 
do so. 
The consequences of these actions 
alone have shaken our democratic sys-
tem. What message will we send if we 
choose not to hold this President ac-
countable for his abuse of power to so-
licit reelection interference in our up-
coming election? The misconduct un-
dertaken by this President may lead 
future Presidents to believe that they, 
too, can use the substantial power con-
ferred on them by the Constitution in 
order to undermine it. Nothing could 
weaken the integrity of our elections 
more, and no campaign finance law or 
statement by a future FBI Director 
could stand up to the precedent of elec-
toral misconduct set by the President 
of the United States if we do not say 
clearly that this behavior is unaccept-
able and, more than unacceptable, im-
peachable. 
We also undermine our global stand-
ing. As a country long viewed as a 
model for democratic ideals worth 
emulating, we have, for generations, 
been the ‘‘shining city upon a hill’’ 
that 
President 
Reagan 
described. 
America is not just a country but also 
an idea. But of what worth is that idea 
if, when tried, we do not affirm the val-
ues that underpin it? 
What will those nascent democracies 
around the world conclude; that de-
mocracy is not only difficult but 
maybe that it is too difficult? Maybe 
that it is impossible? And who will 
come to fill the void we leave when the 
light from that shining city upon a hill 
is extinguished? The autocrats with 
whom we compete, who value not free-
dom 
and 
fair 
elections 
but 
the 
unending rule of a repressive executive; 
autocrats who value not freedom of the 
press 
and 
open 
debate 
but 
disinformation, propaganda, and state- 
sanctioned lies. 
Vladimir Putin would like nothing 
better. The Russians have little democ-
racy left, thanks to Vladimir Putin. It 
is an autocracy; it is a thugocracy. The 
Russian story line, the Russian nar-
rative, the Russian propaganda, the 
Russian view they would like people 
around the world to believe is that 
every country is just the same, just the 
same corrupt system: There is no dif-
ference. It is not a competition be-
tween autocracy and democracy. No, it 
is just between autocrats and hypo-
crites. 
They make no bones about their loss 
of democracy. They just want the rest 
of the world to believe you can’t fight 
it anywhere. Why take to the streets of 
Moscow to demand something better if 
there is nothing better anywhere else. 
That is the Russian story. That is the 
Russian story. That is who prospers by 
the defeat of democracy. That is who 
wins by the defeat of our democratic 
ideals. It is not other democracies; it is 
the autocrats who are on the rise all 
over the world. 
I think all of us in this room have 
grown up in a generation where each 
successive generation lived with more 
freedom than the one that came before. 
We each had more freedom of speech 
and associations, the freedom to prac-
tice our faith. This was true at home. 
It was true all over the world. I think 
we came to believe this was some im-
mutable law of nature, only to find it 
isn’t, only to come to the terrible real-
ization that this year fewer people 
have freedom than last, and there is no 
guarantee that next year people will 
live in more freedom than today. And 
the prospect for our children is even 
more in doubt. 
It turns out, there is nothing immu-
table about this. Every generation has 
to fight for it. We are fighting for it 
right now. There is no guarantee that 
this democracy that has served us so 
well will continue to prosper. We will 
struggle to protect this idea, and even 
as we do, we will struggle to protect 
our security in more tangible ways. 
Support for an independent and demo-
cratic Ukraine, which is the literal bul-
wark against Russian expansionism in 
Europe, is essential to our security. 
Russia showed that when it invaded 
Ukraine in 2014 and sought to redraw 
the map of Europe. 
Was our commitment to Ukraine’s 
independence and sovereignty just an 
empty promise or are we prepared to 
support its efforts to keep Russia con-
tained so they and we may all eventu-
ally enjoy a long peace? 
Russia is not a threat—I don’t need 
to tell you—to Eastern Europe alone. 
Ukraine has become the de facto prov-
ing ground for just the types of hybrid 
warfare that the 21st century will be-
come 
defined 
by: 
cyber 
attacks, 
disinformation campaigns, efforts to 
undermine the legitimacy of state in-
stitutions, whether that is voting sys-
tems or financial markets. The Krem-
lin showed boldly in 2016 that, with the 
malign skills it honed in Ukraine, they 
would not stay in Ukraine. Instead, 
Russia employed them here to attack 
our institutions, and they will do so 
again. Indeed, they have never stopped. 
Will we allow the primary country now 
fighting Russia to be weakened, plac-
ing our troops in Europe at greater 
risk and opening the door to greater in-
terference in our affairs at home? 
If we allow the President of the 
United States to pursue his political 
and personal interests rather than the 
national interests, we send a message 
to our European allies that our com-
mitment to a Europe free and whole is 
for sale to the highest bidder. The 
strength of our global alliances relies 
on a shared understanding of what that 
alliance stands for: one built on the 
rule of law, on free and fair elections, 
and on a shared struggle against ag-
gression from autocratic regimes. 
We are countries built on a commit-
ment to our people, not unyielding loy-
alty to a President who would be King. 
A President has a right to hold a call 
with a foreign leader, yes. And he has a 
right to decide the time and location of 
a meeting with that leader, yes. And he 
has a right to withhold funding to that 
leader should the law be followed and 
the purpose be just. 
But he does not, under our laws and 
under our Constitution, have a right to 
use the powers of his office to cor-
ruptly solicit foreign aid—prohibited 
foreign aid—in his reelection. He does 
not. He does not have the right to with-
hold official Presidential acts to secure 
that assistance, and he certainly does 
not have the right to undermine our 
elections and place our security at risk 
for his own personal benefit. No Presi-
dent, Republican or Democratic, can be 
permitted to do that. 
Now let me turn to the second Arti-
cle of Impeachment, which charges the 
President with misusing the powers of 
his office to obstruct and interfere with 
the impeachment inquiry. 
The evidence you will hear during 
the House presentation is equally unde-
niable and damning. President Trump 
issued a blanket order directing the en-
tire executive branch not to cooperate 
with the impeachment inquiry and to 
withhold all documents and testimony. 
His order was categorical. It was indis-
criminate and historically unprece-
dented. No President before President 
Trump has ever ordered the complete 
defiance of an impeachment inquiry or 
sought to obstruct and impede so com-
prehensively the ability of the House of 
Representatives to investigate high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
The President was able to block 
agencies across the executive branch 
from producing any records or docu-
ments to the House investigative com-
mittees, despite duly authorized sub-
poenas. The White House continues to 
refuse to produce a single document or 
record in response to a House subpoena 
that remains in full force and effect. 
The Department of State and Office of 
Management and Budget, Department 
of Energy, and the Department of De-
fense continue to refuse to provide a 
single document or record in response 
to House subpoenas that remain in full 
force and effect. 
It is worth underscoring this point. 
The House has yet to receive a single 
document from the executive branch 
agencies pursuant to its subpoenas. 
Not a single piece of paper, email, or 
other record has been turned over—not 
one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S456 
January 22, 2020 
While I pause to get a drink of water, 
let me let you know for your timing 
that I have about 10 minutes left in my 
presentation. So the end is in sight. 
President Trump has also success-
fully blocked witnesses—nine of them— 
under subpoena from testifying, wit-
nesses with firsthand knowledge of the 
President’s actions, including his clos-
est aides, some of whom were directly 
involved in executing the President’s 
improper orders. These witnesses in-
clude Mick Mulvaney and Robert Blair; 
Russell Vought, the acting head of the 
Office of Management and Budget; Mi-
chael Duffey, a senior official; and the 
President’s chief legal advisor on the 
National 
Security 
Council, 
John 
Eisenberg, among others. 
The managers will present in detail 
what these officials knew about their 
role in executing different parts of the 
President’s scheme. There is no dis-
pute, nor could there be, that President 
Trump’s order substantially obstructed 
the House impeachment inquiry. That 
obstruction continues unabated today, 
even as we stand here at the start of 
the President’s trial. 
The President has been able to do so 
only because of the uniquely powerful 
position he holds as our Commander in 
Chief. No other American could seek to 
obstruct an investigation into his own 
wrongdoing this way. No other Amer-
ican could use the vast powers and le-
vers of his government to conduct a 
corrupt scheme to benefit themselves 
and then use those same powers to sup-
press evidence and bar any cooperation 
with 
the 
authorities 
investigating 
them—not a police chief, not a mayor, 
not a Governor, not any elected official 
in the country, and certainly not any 
unelected official in the country. 
For those folks watching us from 
around the country, you know what 
would happen to them if they defied a 
lawful subpoena. 
They got a subpoena commanding 
them to appear. You know what would 
happen to them because they are not 
above the law: They would be arrested; 
they would be detained; they would be 
incarcerated; they would be forced to 
comply. They are not above the law, 
and neither are we, and neither is the 
President. 
And, yet, despite the fact that he is 
not above the law, despite the Presi-
dent’s extensive and persistent efforts, 
the House heard from courageous wit-
nesses who obeyed lawful subpoenas, 
and we gathered overwhelming evi-
dence. The House built a formidable 
case that forms the basis of these arti-
cles. 
The second article for obstruction of 
Congress is not simply about President 
Trump’s decision to obstruct a congres-
sional investigation or even an im-
peachment inquiry. It should not be 
misunderstood as some routine dispute 
between two branches of government, 
nor should it be reduced to the notion 
that the President was simply pro-
tecting 
himself 
or 
fighting 
back 
against a partisan or overzealous Con-
gress. The charges in the second article 
are much more serious and urgent than 
that. 
First, the President’s attempt to ob-
struct the inquiry so categorically and 
comprehensively is part and parcel of 
the President’s furious effort to con-
ceal, suppress, and cover up his own 
misconduct. From the very first mo-
ment his actions were at the risk of 
coming to light, President Trump has 
sought to hide and cover up key evi-
dence, even as his scheme to pressure 
Ukraine was still underway. 
As the House’s presentation will 
make clear, the President’s coverup 
started even before the House began to 
investigate the President’s Ukraine-re-
lated activity. The President learned 
early on of the existence of a lawful 
whistleblower complaint from within 
the intelligence community that would 
ring the first alarm. He deployed the 
White House and Justice Department 
to intervene in an unprecedented fash-
ion to conceal and then withhold from 
Congress—for the first time ever—a 
credible and urgent whistleblower com-
plaint, even though the law requires 
that it be provided to the congressional 
intelligence committees. 
Once the impeachment inquiry was 
underway in late September, the Presi-
dent used the immense and unique 
power at his disposal to direct and 
maintain at every turn the categorical 
defiance 
of 
congressional 
scrutiny, 
even as he attacked the inquiry itself 
and its witnesses. The President of-
fered multiple and shifting justifica-
tions for obstructing the House’s in-
quiry, each of them deficient, while his 
actions and statements powerfully re-
flect his own consciousness of guilt. 
Second, the ramifications of the 
President’s obstruction go beyond the 
sinister motives of simply covering up 
his actions. His obstruction strikes at 
the heart of our Constitution. It 
threatens the last line of defense our 
Founders purposefully enshrined in our 
system to protect our democracy. 
If Presidents can obstruct an im-
peachment inquiry undertaken by the 
House and evade accountability in the 
Senate for doing so, they usurp an es-
sential power granted exclusively to 
the Congress—and for a reason. Presi-
dents could seize for themselves the 
power to neutralize and nullify the im-
peachment clause in order to shield 
themselves from any accountability. 
And if Congress is unable to inves-
tigate and impeach a President for 
abuse of their office, our democracy’s 
essential check on a rogue President 
would fail. It would no longer protect 
the American people from a corrupt 
President who presents an ongoing 
threat. This is the outcome every 
American should be concerned about 
and one that the Founders warned us 
about. 
Through the impeachment clause, 
the Framers of the Constitution em-
powered Congress to thoroughly inves-
tigate Presidential malfeasance—and 
to respond, if necessary, by removing 
the President from office. This entire 
framework depends on Congress’s abil-
ity to discover, and then to thoroughly 
and 
effectively 
investigate, 
Presi-
dential misconduct. Without the abil-
ity of Congress to do that, the im-
peachment power is a nullity. If you 
can’t investigate it, you can’t enforce 
it and can’t apply it. 
What we confront here, in the second 
Article of Impeachment, is therefore 
an impeachable offense aimed at de-
stroying the impeachment power itself. 
When a President abuses the power of 
his office to so completely defy House 
investigators, and does so without law-
ful cause or excuse, he attacks the Con-
stitution itself. He confirms that he 
sees himself as above the law. His ac-
tions destabilize the separation of pow-
ers, which defines our democracy and 
preserves our freedom, and establish an 
exceedingly dangerous precedent. And 
he proves that he is willing to destroy 
a vital safeguard against tyranny—a 
safeguard meant to protect the Amer-
ican people—just to advance his own 
personal interests in covering up evi-
dence. 
The House’s presentation of the sec-
ond article will therefore focus on 
three core areas that confirm the 
President’s obstruction and require his 
removal from office: first, the singular 
importance and role of the impeach-
ment clause for our democracy and 
why an effort by a President to ob-
struct an impeachment inquiry is, in 
and of itself, an impeachable offense; 
second, why the President’s extensive 
effort to cover up evidence of his mis-
conduct is unprecedented in American 
history and without lawful cause or 
justification; and, finally, why the 
President’s obstruction poses a direct 
threat to our system of self-govern-
ance, with consequences for all Ameri-
cans—today and in the future—and for 
both Chambers of Congress. 
Over the coming days, you will hear 
from the House managers details of 
this scheme and the effort to hide it 
from Congress. The Articles of Im-
peachment that the House presented go 
to the heart of those efforts, and let me 
share a few takeaways. 
The House of Representatives has 
found that, using the powers of his 
high office, President Trump solicited 
the interference of a foreign govern-
ment, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. Presi-
dential election. He did so through a 
scheme or course of conduct that in-
cluded soliciting the government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce inves-
tigations that would benefit his reelec-
tion, harm the election prospects of a 
political opponent, and influence the 
2020 U.S. Presidential election improp-
erly and to his advantage. 
President Trump also sought to pres-
sure the Government of Ukraine to 
take these steps by conditioning offi-
cial U.S. Government acts of signifi-
cant value to Ukraine on Ukraine’s 
public announcement of these inves-
tigations. He engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct for corrupt purposes

in pursuit of his personal political ben-
efit. 
In doing so, President Trump used 
the powers of the Presidency in a man-
ner that compromised the national se-
curity of the United States and under-
mined the integrity of the U.S. demo-
cratic process. He thus ignored and in-
jured the interests of the Nation. 
As part of the House’s impeachment 
inquiry, the committees undertaking 
the 
investigation 
served 
subpoenas 
seeking 
documents 
and 
testimony 
deemed vital to the inquiry from var-
ious executive branch agencies and of-
fices and current and former officials. 
In response, and without lawful cause 
or excuse, President Trump directed 
executive branch agencies, offices, and 
officials not to comply with those sub-
poenas. President Trump thus inter-
posed the powers of the Presidency 
against the lawful subpoenas of the 
House of Representatives and assumed 
to himself functions and judgments 
necessary to the exercise of the sole 
power of impeachment vested by the 
Constitution in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
As George Washington and his troops 
retreated across the Delaware River in 
early December 1776, they were read 
the words of Thomas Paine, published 
that month in his pamphlet, ‘‘The 
American Crisis’’: 
These are the times that try men’s souls. 
The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot 
will, in the crisis, shrink from the service of 
their country; but he that stands by it now, 
deserves the love and thanks of man and 
woman. 
Seventeen days later, George Wash-
ington crossed the Delaware, leading to 
a decisive victory for those who would 
come to shape our promising young 
country. 
As much as our Founders feared an 
unchecked Chief Executive able to pur-
sue his own will over the will of the 
people, they also feared the poison of 
excessive factionalism that could di-
vert us from a difficult service to our 
country. As George Washington warned 
in his farewell address, ‘‘the common 
and continual mischiefs of the spirit of 
party are sufficient to make it the in-
terest and duty of a wise people to dis-
courage and restrain it.’’ 
Our political parties and affiliations 
are central to our democracy, ensuring 
that good and bad political philoso-
phies alike are considered in the mar-
ketplace of ideas. Here, the American 
people can choose between the policies 
of one party or another and make deci-
sions about their political leaders up to 
and including the President of the 
United States based on the degree to 
which that person represents their in-
terests and values. That is not fac-
tionalism; that is the foundation of our 
democracy. 
But when a leader takes the reins of 
the highest office in our land and uses 
that awesome power to solicit the help 
of a foreign country to gain an unfair 
advantage in our free and fair elec-
tions, we all—Democrats and Repub-
licans 
alike—must 
ask 
ourselves 
whether our loyalty is to our party or 
whether it is to our Constitution. If we 
say that we will align ourselves with 
that leader, allowing our sense of duty 
to be usurped by an absolute Execu-
tive, that is not democracy; it is not 
even factionalism. It is a step on the 
road to tyranny. 
The damage that this President has 
done to our relationship with a key 
strategic partner will be remedied over 
time, and Ukraine continues to enjoy 
strong bipartisan support in Congress. 
But if we fail to act, the damage to our 
democratic elections, to our national 
security, to our system of checks and 
balances will be long-lasting and po-
tentially irreversible. 
As you will hear in the coming days, 
President Trump has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-govern-
ance. His conduct has violated his oath 
of office and his constitutional duty to 
faithfully execute the law. He has 
shown no willingness to be constrained 
by the rule of law and has dem-
onstrated that he will continue to 
abuse his power and obstruct investiga-
tions into himself, causing further 
damage to the pillars of our democracy 
if he is not held accountable. 
He cannot be charged with a crime, 
so says the Department of Justice. 
There is no remedy for such a threat 
but removal from office of the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
If impeachment and removal cannot 
hold him accountable, then he truly is 
above the law. 
We are nearly 21⁄2 centuries into this 
beautiful experiment of American de-
mocracy, but our future is not assured. 
As Benjamin Franklin departed the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
he 
was 
asked: ‘‘What have we got? A Republic 
or a Monarchy?’’ He responded simply: 
‘‘A Republic, if you can keep it.’’ 
A fair trial, impartial consideration 
of all of the evidence against the Presi-
dent is how we keep our Republic. 
That concludes our introduction. 
f 
RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Chief Justice, col-
leagues, I suggest we have a recess 
until 10 minutes to 4, at which moment 
we will reconvene, subject to the call of 
the Chair. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, at 3:28 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:56 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House 
managers may resume if they are 
ready. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, before 
I begin, I would like to thank the Chief 
Justice and the Senators for their tem-
perate listening and their patience last 
night as we went into the long hours. 
I truly thank you. 
The House managers will now under-
take to tell you the story of the Presi-
dent’s Ukraine scheme. As we tell the 
story, it is important to note that the 
facts before us are not in dispute. 
There are no close calls. The evidence 
shows that President Trump unlaw-
fully withheld military assistance, ap-
propriated by Congress to aid our ally, 
in order to extort that government 
into helping him win his reelection, 
then tried to cover it up when he got 
caught. 
This is the story of a corrupt, govern-
mentwide effort that drew in Ambas-
sadors, 
Cabinet 
officials, 
executive 
branch agencies, and the Office of the 
President. This effort threatened the 
security of Ukraine in its military 
struggle with Russia and compromised 
our own national security interests be-
cause the President cared only about 
his personal political interests. 
In the spring of 2019, the people of 
Ukraine 
elected 
a 
new 
leader, 
Volodymyr Zelensky, who campaigned 
on a platform of rooting out corruption 
in his country. This pledge was wel-
comed by the United States and its al-
lies, but the new government also 
threatened 
the 
work 
of 
President 
Trump’s chief agent in Ukraine, Rudy 
Giuliani. 
As President Zelensky was taking 
power, Mr. Giuliani was already en-
gaged in an effort to convince Ukrain-
ian officials to announce two sham in-
vestigations. The first was an effort to 
smear 
former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden. The second was designed to un-
dermine the intelligence community’s 
unanimous 
assessment 
that 
Russia 
interfered in the 2016 election. 
One obstacle to Mr. Giuliani’s work 
was Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. A 
33-year veteran of the Foreign Service, 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
had 
partnered with Ukraine to root out the 
kind of corruption that would have al-
lowed Mr. Giuliani’s lies to flourish. 
In order to complete his mission, Mr. 
Giuliani 
first 
needed 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch out of the way. So in 
early 2019, Mr. Giuliani launched a pub-
lic smear campaign against the Ambas-
sador, an effort that involved Mr. 
Giuliani’s allies in Ukraine, the Presi-
dent’s allies in the United States, and, 
eventually, President Trump himself. 
Please remember that the object of 
the President’s Ukraine scheme was to 
obtain a corrupt advantage for his re-
election campaign. As we will show, 
the President went to extraordinary 
lengths to cheat in the next election. 
That scheme begins with the attempt 
to get Ambassador Yovanovitch ‘‘out 
of the way.’’ 
By 
all 
accounts, 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was a highly respected 
and effective Ambassador. Witnesses 
uniformly praised her 33-year career as 
a nonpartisan public servant and told 
us that she particularly excelled in 
fighting corruption abroad. President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S458 
January 22, 2020 
George Bush named her as an Ambas-
sador twice, and President Obama nom-
inated her as Ambassador to Ukraine, 
where 
she 
represented 
the 
United 
States from 2016 to 2019. 
Eradicating corruption in Ukraine 
has been a key policy priority of the 
U.S. Government for years. During the 
House inquiry, the Ambassador ex-
plained 
why 
implementing 
this 
anticorruption policy was so impor-
tant. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. YOVANOVITCH. As critical as the war 
against Russia is, Ukraine’s struggling de-
mocracy has an equally important challenge: 
Battling the Soviet legacy of corruption 
which has pervaded Ukraine’s government. 
Corruption makes Ukraine’s leaders ever 
vulnerable to Russia, and the Ukrainian peo-
ple 
understand 
that. 
That’s 
why 
they 
launched the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, 
demanding to be a part of Europe, demand-
ing the transformation of the system, de-
manding to live under the rule of law. 
Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equal-
ly to all people, whether the individual in 
question is the President or any other cit-
izen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity. 
Here again, there is a coincidence of inter-
ests. Corrupt leaders are inherently less 
trustworthy while an honest and account-
able Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.- 
Ukrainian partnership more reliable and 
more valuable to the United States. 
Mr. 
Manager 
NADLER. 
On 
the 
evening of April 24, 2019, Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was hosting an event at 
the U.S. Embassy, honoring the mem-
ory of an anticorruption fighter who 
had been killed when acid was thrown 
in her face the previous year. At about 
10 that night, the Embassy event was 
interrupted by a telephone call from 
Washington. Ambassador Yovanovitch 
described this conversation with the 
head of the State Department’s human 
resources department. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. YOVANOVITCH. She said that there 
was great concern on the seventh floor of the 
State Department. That’s where the leader-
ship at the State Department sits. There was 
great concern. They were worried. She just 
wanted to give me a heads up about this. 
And, you know, things seemed to be going 
on, and so she just wanted to give me a heads 
up. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Confused, the 
Ambassador asked for more informa-
tion from Washington. Three hours 
later they spoke again. Ambassador 
Yovanovitch learned that there were 
concerns about her ‘‘up the street’’; 
that is, at the White House. The Am-
bassador was told to get on the first 
plane home. 
Why was this respected career dip-
lomat abruptly removed from her post? 
Why was she, in fact, urged by the 
State Department to catch the first 
plane home, that she was in danger, 
she shouldn’t wait? 
At the time, the White House would 
not say, but today we know the truth. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was the victim of a smear 
campaign organized by Rudy Giuliani, 
amplified by President Trump’s allies, 
and designed to give President Trump 
the pretext he needed to recall her 
without warning. Mr. Giuliani has ad-
mitted as much to the press. 
In order to understand Mr. Giuliani’s 
smear campaign against Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, you need to know about a 
few additional characters who Mr. 
Giuliani drew into his scheme. 
The first of these characters is 
Viktor Shokin, the disgraced former 
prosecutor general of Ukraine, who was 
fired by the Ukrainian Government for 
gross corruption. In 2016, at the urging 
of the European Union, the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, and the U.S. 
Government, 
the 
Parliament 
of 
Ukraine voted to remove Mr. Shokin as 
prosecutor general because he was cor-
rupt and refused to prosecute corrup-
tion cases. The United States, the Eu-
ropean Union, and the International 
Monetary Fund all urged the Ukraine 
Government to dismiss Mr. Shokin. 
The 
second 
character 
is 
Yuriy 
Lutsenko, who succeeded Mr. Shokin 
as prosecutor general. Mr. Lutsenko 
also proved reluctant to prosecute cor-
ruption cases, and several witnesses 
testified that he also had a reputation 
for dishonesty and corruption. Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch and Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary George Kent both testi-
fied that the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv 
eventually stopped working with Mr. 
Lutsenko altogether. 
Shokin, Lutsenko, and Giuliani—the 
goals of all three characters were 
aligned. Shokin had it out for Vice 
President Biden because of the role 
that the Vice President played in his 
2016 firing. The Vice President, car-
rying 
out 
U.S. 
policy, 
urged 
the 
Ukrainian Government to dismiss the 
corrupt Shokin. 
I note that the Vice President—the 
former Vice President—has been criti-
cized for urging that he be fired. 
Lutsenko found his career trajectory 
fading and wanted President Trump’s 
support to boost his political prospects 
in Ukraine. Giuliani needed partners in 
Ukraine willing to announce two sham 
investigations meant to boost Presi-
dent Trump’s own campaign. All three 
wanted Ambassador Yovanovitch out 
of the way. 
So in early 2019, the smear campaign 
began. Mr. Lutsenko became the pri-
mary 
vector 
for 
false 
allegations 
against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary George Kent 
testified that Lutsenko’s allegations 
against Ambassador Yovanovitch were 
motivated by revenge. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. KENT. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, 
I became increasingly aware of an effort by 
Rudy Giuliani and others, including his asso-
ciates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to run a 
campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch 
and other officials at the U.S. Embassy in 
Kyiv. The chief agitators on the Ukrainian 
side of this effort were some of those same 
corrupt former prosecutors I had encoun-
tered, particularly Yuriy Lutsenko and 
Viktor Shokin. They were now pedaling false 
information in order to extract revenge 
against those who had exposed their mis-
conduct, including U.S. diplomats, Ukrain-
ian anticorruption officials, and reform- 
minded civil society groups in Ukraine. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. As Mr. Kent 
indicated, the smear campaign against 
Ambassador Yovanovitch was orches-
trated by a core group of corrupt 
Ukrainian officials working at Mr. 
Giuliani’s direction. This group in-
cluded two additional characters who 
have been in the news of late—Lev 
Parnas and Igor Fruman. Mr. Parnas 
and Mr. Fruman were of course in-
dicted last year on several charges, in-
cluding charges related to large dona-
tions they made to support President 
Trump. 
Simply put, in doing her job well, 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
drew 
Mr. 
Lutsenko’s ire, and, as Mr. Kent ob-
served, ‘‘You can’t promote principled 
anti-corruption efforts without pissing 
off corrupt people.’’ 
As it turned out, this statement ap-
plied to Yuriy Lutsenko and to Rudy 
Giuliani, who feared that the Ambas-
sador would stand in the way of his 
corrupt efforts to coerce Ukraine into 
conducting investigations that would 
benefit the political interests of his cli-
ent, President Trump. 
Giuliani’s coordinated smear cam-
paign against Ambassador Yovanovitch 
became public in the United States in 
late March 2019, with the publication of 
a series of opinion pieces in The Hill, 
based on interviews with Lutsenko. On 
March 20, 2019, in one piece in The Hill, 
Lutsenko falsely alleged that Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch had given him a so- 
called 
‘‘do-not-prosecute 
list.’’ 
Not 
only was the allegation false, but after 
having helped originate the claim, 
Lutsenko himself would later go on to 
retract it. 
The same piece also falsely stated 
that 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
had 
‘‘made disparaging statements about 
President Trump.’’ A statement issued 
by the State Department declared the 
allegations to be a total fabrication. 
President 
Trump 
promoted 
Solo-
mon’s article in a tweet, which intensi-
fied the public attacks against Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch. Then, on March 24, 
Donald Trump, Jr., called Ambassador 
Yovanovitch a ‘‘joker’’ on Twitter and 
called for her removal. 
You can see the slides of the two 
tweets. 
These 
unfounded 
smears 
by 
the 
President and his son reverberated in 
Ukraine. Deputy Assistant Secretary 
George Kent testified that ‘‘starting in 
mid-March,’’ Rudy Giuliani was ‘‘al-
most unmissable’’ in this ‘‘campaign of 
slander.’’ And according to Mr. Kent, 
Mr. Lutsenko’s press spokeswoman 
retweeted Donald Trump, Jr.’s tweet 
attacking the Ambassador, further un-
dermining her standing in Ukraine— 
her standing, the U.S. Ambassador’s 
standing. Mr. Giuliani was not content 
to stay behind the scenes, either. He 
promoted the same attacks on the Am-
bassador on Twitter, FOX News, and 
elsewhere. 
At the end of March, the attacks in-
tensified. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
sent Under Secretary of State for Po-
litical Affairs David Hale an email de-
tailing her concerns and asking for a

strong statement of support from the 
State Department. In reply, the State 
Department told her that they were 
unwilling to help her—their own Am-
bassador—because if they issued a pub-
lic statement supporting her, ‘‘it could 
be undermined,’’ by the President and 
their concern that ‘‘the rug would be 
pulled out from underneath the State 
Department.’’ 
The State Department cannot ex-
press support for an American Ambas-
sador threatened abroad because they 
are concerned that if they express sup-
port for that American Ambassador, 
the rug will be pulled out from under 
them by the President. What it must 
have taken to convince our State De-
partment to refuse support for its Am-
bassador. 
Phone records show that Giuliani 
also kept the White House apprised of 
these developments, as you can see 
from these slides. 
Again, it is worth remembering that 
smearing Ambassador Yovanovitch was 
a means to an end. Removing her 
would allow the President’s allies the 
freedom to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce their sham investigations. 
So we should talk for a few minutes 
about the investigations that Rudy 
Giuliani and his henchmen were pro-
moting on behalf of the President. 
Let’s focus first on the allegation 
that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in 
our last Presidential election. In Feb-
ruary 2017, shortly after the intel-
ligence community—the CIA, the FBI, 
all the intelligence agencies of the 
United States—unanimously assessed 
that Russia interfered in the election 
to help Donald Trump, this alternative 
theory gained some attention when 
Russian President Putin promoted it at 
a press conference. 
‘‘Second,’’ he said—I am quoting 
from him. It is in the Russian on these 
slides, I think. 
Second, as we all know, during the presi-
dential campaign in the United States, the 
Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral 
position in favor of one candidate. 
More than that, certain oligarchs, cer-
tainly with the approval of the political 
leadership funded this candidate, or female 
candidate, to be more precise. 
That is President Putin talking, 
shifting the blame to Ukraine. 
Dr. Fiona Hill best explained how the 
Ukraine narrative is a fictional nar-
rative being propagated by the Russian 
security services. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. HILL. Based on questions and state-
ments I have heard, some of you on this com-
mittee appear to believe that Russia and its 
security services did not conduct a campaign 
against our country and that perhaps, some-
how for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a 
fictional narrative being perpetrated and 
propagated by the Russian security services 
themselves. 
The unfortunate truth is that Russia was 
the foreign power that systematically at-
tacked our democratic institutions in 2016. 
This is the public conclusion of our intel-
ligence agencies confirmed in bipartisan and 
congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, 
even if some of the underlying details must 
remain classified. 
The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian 
campaign remain evident today. Our Nation 
is being torn apart. The truth is questioned. 
Our highly professional, expert career For-
eign Service is being undermined. U.S. sup-
port for Ukraine which continues to face 
armed Russian aggression is being politi-
cized. The Russian Government’s goal is to 
weaken our country, to diminish America’s 
global role, and to neutralize a perceived 
U.S. threat to Russian interests. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. President 
Trump knew this too. His former 
Homeland 
Security 
Advisor, 
Tom 
Bossert, 
said 
that 
the 
idea 
that 
Ukraine hacked the DNC server was 
‘‘not only a conspiracy theory, it is 
completely debunked,’’ and he and 
other U.S. officials spent hours with 
the President explaining why. 
The second false allegation that the 
President wanted the Ukrainians to an-
nounce was that Vice President Biden 
used his power to protect a company on 
whose board his son sat by forcing the 
removal of Viktor Shokin, the corrupt 
former prosecutor general. 
It is true that Vice President Biden 
helped remove Mr. Shokin, who was 
widely believed to be corrupt. As I said 
a few minutes ago, it was official pol-
icy of the United States, the European 
community, and others, in order to 
fight corruption in Ukraine, to ask 
that Shokin and Lutsenko be removed. 
So the Vice President, Vice President 
Biden, in fulfilling U.S. policy, pres-
sured Ukraine to remove Shokin—not 
to secure some personal benefit but to 
advance the official policy of the 
United States and its allies. Even 
Lutsenko, who initially seeded the al-
legations against Mr. Biden in Amer-
ican media, later admitted that the al-
legations against the Vice President 
were false. And Rudy Giuliani told 
Kurt Volker, the Special Representa-
tive for Ukrainian Negotiations, who 
had a prominent role in the scheme, 
that he also knew the attacks on Joe 
Biden were a lie. 
With Ambassador Yovanovitch out of 
the way, the first chapter of the 
Ukraine scheme was complete. Mr. 
Giuliani and his agents could now 
apply direct pressure to the Ukrainian 
Government to spread these two false-
hoods. 
Who benefited from this scheme? 
Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in 
the first place? Of course we could re-
phrase that question as the former Re-
publican leader of the Senate, Howard 
Baker, asked it in 1973: What did the 
President know, and when he did he 
know it? 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, President’s 
counsel: President Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky’s relationship started 
out well. President Trump wanted the 
two investigations from Zelensky, and 
he had no reason to believe he would 
not get what he wanted. 
On 
April 
21, 
2019, 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky, who was new to politics, won 
a landslide victory in Ukraine’s Presi-
dential election. That evening, Presi-
dent Trump called Zelensky to con-
gratulate him. On that first call—the 
first call—Zelensky invited President 
Trump to visit Ukraine for the upcom-
ing inauguration. President Trump, in 
turn, promised that his administration 
would send someone at ‘‘a very, very 
high level.’’ 
During that same April call, Presi-
dent Trump invited President Zelensky 
to the White House, saying: 
When you’re settled in and ready, I’d like 
to invite you to the White House. We’ll have 
a lot of things to talk about, but we’re with 
you all the way. 
Zelensky immediately accepted the 
President’s invitation, adding that the 
‘‘whole team and I are looking forward 
to that visit.’’ 
Numerous witnesses testified about 
the significance of a White House 
meeting for the political newcomer. A 
White 
House 
meeting 
would 
show 
Ukrainians that America supported 
Zelensky’s anti-corruption platform. 
The clear backing of the President of 
the United States—Ukraine’s most im-
portant patron—would also send a pow-
erful message to Russia that we had 
Ukraine’s back. 
During that April 21 call, President 
Trump never even uttered the word 
‘‘corruption,’’ but the official White 
House call recap falsely stated that the 
two Presidents had discussed Ukraine’s 
anti-corruption efforts. 
Shortly after the phone call, Jennifer 
Williams, adviser to Vice President 
PENCE, learned that President Trump 
asked Vice President PENCE to attend 
Zelensky’s inauguration. 
Williams and her colleagues began 
planning Pence’s trip to Kyiv. At the 
same time, Giuliani was trying to get 
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and 
alleged 2016 election interference. On 
April 24, Giuliani went on ‘‘FOX & 
Friends’’ and had this to say: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Keep your eye on Ukraine, because in 
Ukraine a lot of dirty work was done. I’m 
digging up the information. American offi-
cials were used. Ukrainian officials were 
used. That is like collusion with the Ukrain-
ians and—or actually, in this case, con-
spiracy with the Ukrainians. I think you’d 
get some interesting information about Joe 
Biden from Ukraine. About his son, Hunter 
Biden. About a company he was on the board 
of for years, which may be one of the most 
crooked companies in Ukraine. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. For 
this campaign to be truly beneficial to 
his boss President Trump, Giuliani 
needed access to the new government 
in Ukraine. He dispatched his associ-
ates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to 
try to make inroads with Zelensky’s 
team. 
On April 25, former Vice President 
Biden publicly announced his bid for 
Presidency, and immediately he was at 
the top of the polls. 
That same day, David Holmes, an 
American diplomat at our Embassy in 
Ukraine, learned that Giuliani had 
reached out to the head of President 
Zelensky’s campaign. As Mr. Holmes 
explained, the new Ukrainian Govern-
ment began to think that Giuliani

January 22, 2020 
‘‘was a significant person in terms of 
managing their relationship with the 
United States.’’ 
As 
Giuliani 
and 
his 
associates 
worked behind the scenes to get access 
to the new leadership in Ukraine, 
President Trump was publicly sig-
naling his interest in the investiga-
tions. On May 2, the President ap-
peared on FOX News. When asked, 
‘‘Should the former vice president ex-
plain himself on his feeling in Ukraine 
and whether there was a conflict . . . 
with his son’s business interests?’’ 
President Trump replied as follows: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
I’m hearing it’s a major scandal, major 
problem. Very bad things happened, and 
we’ll see what that is. They even have him 
on tape, talking about it. They have Joe 
Biden on tape talking about the prosecutor. 
And I’ve seen that tape. A lot of people are 
talking about that tape, but that’s up to 
them. They have to solve that problem. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The 
tape President Trump referenced is a 
video from January 2018 in which Vice 
President Biden explained that he 
placed an ultimatum to the Ukrainian 
President to remove the corrupt pros-
ecutor general to ensure that taxpayer 
money would be used appropriately. 
The Vice President’s actions were con-
sistent with official U.S. policy as well 
as the opinions of the international 
community. 
On May 9, the New York Times pub-
lished an article about Giuliani’s plan 
to 
visit 
Ukraine. 
In 
the 
article, 
Giuliani confirmed that he planned to 
meet with Zelensky. At that meeting, 
he wanted to press the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment to pursue the investigations 
that President Trump promoted only 
days earlier. Giuliani said: ‘‘We’re not 
meddling in an election, we are med-
dling in an investigation, which we 
have a right to do.’’ 
Giuliani even went so far as to ac-
knowledge that his actions could ben-
efit President Trump personally. He 
said: ‘‘[T]his isn’t foreign policy—I’m 
asking them to do an investigation 
that they’re doing already and that 
other people are telling them to stop. 
And I am going to give them reasons 
why they shouldn’t stop it because that 
information will be very, very helpful 
to my client, and may turn out to be 
helpful to my government.’’ 
That is it right there—Giuliani ad-
mitting he was asking Ukraine to work 
an investigation that would be ‘‘very, 
very helpful’’ to the President. He was 
not doing foreign policy. He was not 
doing this on behalf of the government. 
He was doing this for the personal in-
terests of his client, Donald J. Trump. 
The next morning, on May 10, amid 
coverage 
of 
his 
planned 
trip 
to 
Ukraine, 
Giuliani 
tweeted 
further 
about Biden and then had a flurry of 
calls with Parnas, who was helping in 
planning his trip to Ukraine. 
That same day, Giuliani also spoke 
with Ambassador Volker on the phone 
for more than 30 minutes. Ambassador 
Volker had learned that Giuliani had 
intended to travel to Ukraine and had 
called to warn Giuliani that Prosecutor 
General Lutsenko ‘‘is not credible. 
Don’t listen to what he is saying.’’ 
Later that day, Giuliani had a 17- 
minute call with a masked White 
House number before speaking again 
with Parnas for 12 minutes. 
That same day, on May 10, Politico 
asked 
President 
Trump 
about 
Giuliani’s upcoming trip, and he re-
plied, ‘‘I have not spoken to him at any 
great length, but I will. . . . I will 
speak to him about it before he 
leaves.’’ But that evening, on FOX 
News, Giuliani announced: ‘‘I’m not 
going to go’’ to Ukraine ‘‘because I 
think I’m walking into a group of peo-
ple that are enemies of the President.’’ 
Separately, in a text message to ‘‘Po-
litico,’’ Giuliani alleged that the origi-
nal offer for a meeting with Zelensky 
was a ‘‘set-up.’’ He said it was a set-up 
orchestrated by ‘‘several vocal critics’’ 
of President Trump who were advising 
Zelensky. 
Giuliani 
declared 
that 
‘‘Zelensky is in [the] hands of avowed 
enemies of President Trump.’’ 
But Giuliani had not stopped trying. 
He 
had 
Parnas 
send 
a 
letter 
to 
Zelensky’s senior aide on May 11 ask-
ing for a meeting. That letter made it 
clear that Giuliani was representing 
President Trump as ‘‘a private citizen’’ 
and that he was working with Presi-
dent Trump’s ‘‘knowledge and con-
sent.’’ 
The letter is on the slide. It reads: 
In my capacity as personal counsel to 
President Trump and with his knowledge and 
consent, I request a meeting with you on this 
upcoming Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 
14. I will need no more than a half-hour of 
your time and I will be accompanied by my 
colleague Victoria Toensing, a distinguished 
American attorney who is very familiar with 
the matter. 
But it did not appear that Giuliani 
and Parnas’s attempts to get the meet-
ing were working. That same day, 
Giuliani sent a text message to Parnas 
asking, ‘‘This guy is canceling meet-
ing, I think?’’ Approximately 3 hours 
later, Giuliani sent Parnas drafts of a 
public statement that ‘‘people advising 
the PRES ELECT are no friends of the 
President.’’ 
Three days later, President Trump 
instructed Vice President PENCE not to 
attend the inauguration in Ukraine— 
just 3 days later. Vice Presidential 
staffer Jennifer Williams received a 
surprising call from PENCE’s Chief of 
Staff. She described it during her pub-
lic testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice 
President’s chief of staff called and informed 
me that President Trump had decided that 
the Vice President would not attend the in-
auguration in Ukraine. She did not provide 
any further explanation. I relayed that in-
struction to others involved in planning the 
potential trip. I also informed the NSC that 
the Vice President would not be attending, 
so that it could identify a head of delegation 
to represent the United States at President- 
elect Zelensky’s inauguration. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Nota-
bly, Williams confirmed that the inau-
guration date had not yet been sched-
uled at the time of that phone call. So 
the reason for President Trump’s deci-
sion was certainly not due to a sched-
uling conflict. 
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ulti-
mately led the delegation to the inau-
gural. Accompanying Secretary Perry 
were Ambassador to the European 
Union, Gordon Sondland; Ambassador 
Volker; NSC Director for Ukraine, LTC 
Alexander Vindman; and Senator RON 
JOHNSON also attended many of the in-
augural events with the delegation. 
When asked if this delegation was a 
good group, Holmes replied that it 
‘‘was not as senior a delegation as we 
might have expected.’’ 
After the inauguration, Ambassadors 
Volker and Sondland left Kyiv with a 
very favorable impression of President 
Zelensky. 
Ambassador 
Volker 
said 
they believed it was important that 
President Trump personally engage 
with the President of Ukraine in order 
to demonstrate full U.S. support for 
him. 
When the inauguration team re-
turned to the United States, they had a 
meeting with President Trump on May 
23. The May 23 meeting with President 
Trump proved to be important for two 
good reasons. First, with Ambassador 
Yovanovitch out of the way, President 
Trump 
authorized 
Ambassador 
Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Ambas-
sador Volker to lead engagement with 
the new administration in Ukraine; 
and two, President Trump instructed 
them to satisfy Giuliani’s concerns in 
order to move forward on Ukraine mat-
ters. 
These officials were all political ap-
pointees, and Ambassador Sondland 
had donated $1 million to the Presi-
dent’s inauguration. The President saw 
these three political appointees as offi-
cials who would fulfill his requests. 
Ambassador Volker testified that he, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Secretary 
Perry, and Senator JOHNSON took turns 
making their case that this is a new 
crowd. 
It 
is 
a 
new 
President 
in 
Ukraine. He is committed to doing the 
right things, including fighting corrup-
tion. They recommended that Presi-
dent Trump follow through on his invi-
tation for President Zelensky to meet 
with him in the Oval Office, but Presi-
dent Trump did not receive the rec-
ommendation well. 
At his public hearing, Ambassador 
Volker described the May 23 Oval Of-
fice meeting with President Trump. 
Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. We stressed our 
finding that President Zelensky represented 
the best chance for getting Ukraine out of 
the mire of corruption it had been in for over 
20 years. We urged him [President Trump] to 
invite President Zelensky to the White 
House. The President was very skeptical. 
Given Ukraine’s history of corruption, that’s 
understandable. He said that Ukraine was a 
corrupt country, full of terrible people. He 
said, ‘‘They tried to take me down.’’ In the 
course of that conversation, he referenced 
conversations with Mayor Giuliani. It was

January 22, 2020 
clear to me that despite the positive news 
and recommendations being conveyed by this 
official delegation about the new President, 
President Trump had a deeply rooted nega-
tive view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He 
was receiving other information from other 
sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was 
more negative, causing him to retain this 
negative view. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Wit-
nesses said the reference to ‘‘taking me 
down’’ was to unfounded allegations 
that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 
election. This was what President 
Trump considered to be corruption in 
Ukraine. 
The 
President’s 
words 
echoed 
Giuliani’s 
public 
statements 
about 
Ukraine in early May. Rather than 
committing to an Oval Office meeting 
with the Ukrainian leader, President 
Trump directed the delegation to talk 
to Giuliani. Here is how Ambassador 
Sondland described that instruction 
from the President. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. If we wanted to 
get anything done with Ukraine, it was ap-
parent to us we needed to talk to Rudy. 
GOLDMAN. Right. You understood that 
Giuliani spoke for the President, correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s correct. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Am-
bassador Sondland saw the writing on 
the wall. Sondland concluded that if we 
did not talk to Rudy, nothing would 
move forward on Ukraine. 
The three amigos, as they called 
themselves, did as the President or-
dered and began talking to Giuliani. 
Dr. Hill testified Volker, Sondland, and 
Perry ‘‘gave us every impression that 
they were meeting with Rudy Giuliani 
at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was 
also saying on the television, and in-
deed had said subsequently, that he 
was closely coordinating with the 
State Department.’’ 
Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton 
closely tracked Giuliani’s Ukraine-re-
lated activities. Hill testified about a 
conversation she had with Bolton in 
May of 2019. That conversation was re-
vealing, so let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. . . . And I had already brought 
to Ambassador Bolton’s attention the at-
tacks, the smear campaign against Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch and expressed great re-
gret about how this was unfolding and, in 
fact, the shameful way in which Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was being smeared and at-
tacked. 
And I had asked him if there was anything 
we could do about it, and Ambassador Bolton 
had looked pained, basically indicated with 
body language that there was nothing much 
we could do about it. And he then in the 
course of that discussion said that Rudy 
Giuliani was a hand grenade that was going 
to blow everyone up. 
GOLDMAN. Did you understand what he 
meant by that? 
Dr. HILL. I did, actually. 
GOLDMAN. What did he mean? 
Dr. HILL. Well, I think he meant that ob-
viously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was 
pretty explosive, in any case. He was fre-
quently on television making quite incen-
diary remarks about everyone involved in 
this and that he was clearly pushing forward 
issues and ideas that would, you know, prob-
ably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I 
think that that’s where we are today. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ac-
cording 
to 
Dr. 
Hill’s 
description, 
Bolton said that Giuliani’s influence 
could be an obstacle to increased White 
House engagement with Ukraine. He 
instructed his staff not to meet with 
Giuliani. 
In June, Volker and Sondland re-
layed 
to 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
that 
President Trump wanted to hear from 
Zelensky before scheduling the meet-
ing in the Oval Office. Ambassador 
Taylor testified that he did not under-
stand at the time what that meant. 
Around this time, the President pub-
licly expressed that he thought it 
would be OK to accept foreign inter-
ference to assist his campaign if it was 
in the form of opposition research on 
his opponent. Let’s listen to that 
shocking interview. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
STEPHANOPOULOS. Your campaign this 
time around, if foreigners, if Russia, if 
China, if someone else offers you informa-
tion on opponents, should they accept it or 
should they call the FBI? 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. I think maybe you 
do both. I think you might want to listen, 
there’s nothing wrong with listening. If 
somebody called from a country, Norway, 
‘‘we have information on your opponent.’’ 
Oh, I think I’d want to hear it. 
STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that kind 
of interference in our elections? 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. It’s not an inter-
ference, they have information. I think I’d 
take it. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
Shocking video. Meanwhile, Giuliani 
continued to press Ukraine to do the 
President’s political dirty work. On 
June 21, for instance, Giuliani tweeted 
the following: 
New Pres of Ukraine still silent on inves-
tigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 
election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres 
Poroshenko. Time for leadership and inves-
tigate both if you want to purge how 
Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama 
people. 
The quid pro quo scheme was taking 
shape. Giuliani was publicly advo-
cating for Ukraine to conduct politi-
cally motivated investigations while 
President Trump refused to schedule 
an Oval Office meeting for Ukraine’s 
new 
President. 
As 
Ambassador 
Sondland testified, the scheme to pres-
sure Ukraine to conduct these inves-
tigations would only get more insid-
ious with time. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, the majority leader expressed a 
preference for a break about 2 hours in. 
So it is the House managers’ request 
that I present, and then we take the 
break, if that is acceptable for every-
body. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Any objection? 
Move forward. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, counsel 
for the President, and the American 
people, where were you on July 25, 
2019? It was a Thursday. Members of 
the U.S. Senate were here in this 
Chamber. On July 25, across the Atlan-
tic, our 68,000 troops stationed through-
out Europe were doing what they do 
every day—training and preparing to 
support our allies and defend against 
Russia. 
The professionalism and sacrifice of 
our men and women in uniform is a 
source of great strength, but America 
is also strong and America is also se-
cure because we have friends. On July 
25, 2019, one of those friends was a man 
named Oleksandr Markiv. In a story 
told by Sabra Ayers of the Los Angeles 
Times, Oleksandr was a soldier in the 
Ukrainian Army defending his country 
and Europe against Russian-backed 
forces on Ukraine’s eastern front. He 
was in a trench. He was 38 years old. 
Oleksandr would later die defending his 
country during a mortar attack on his 
fighting position, giving his life, just 
like over 13,000 of his fellow Ukrain-
ians, on the frontlines of the fight for 
liberty in Europe. 
That same Los Angeles Times article 
painted a picture of what the Ukrain-
ians were going through during this 
time. 
Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, like 
Markiv, volunteered to help fight the 
Russian-backed separatists in the east. 
Many of them were sent to the front 
line wearing sneakers and without flak 
jackets and helmets, let alone rifles 
and ammunition. Ukrainians across 
the country organized in an unprece-
dented united civil movement not seen 
since World War II to raise money to 
supply their ragtag military with ev-
erything from soldiers’ boots to bul-
lets. 
And while our friends were at war 
with Russia wearing sneakers, some 
without helmets, something else was 
happening. 
On 
July 
25, 
President 
Trump made a phone call. He spoke 
with Ukrainian President Zelensky and 
asked for a favor. On that same day, 
just hours after his call, his adminis-
tration was quietly placing an illegal 
hold on critical military aid to support 
our friends. 
So why should any American care 
about what is happening in Ukraine? 
Timothy Morrison, former senior direc-
tor for Europe and Russia at the NSC 
put it bluntly: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Timothy MORRISON. I continue to believe 
Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic 
competition between the West and Vladimir 
Putin’s revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing 
power, but it is still a dangerous one. The 
United States aids Ukraine and her people so 
that they can fight Russia over there, and we 
don’t have to fight Russia here. Support for 
Ukraine’s 
territorial 
integrity 
and 
sov-
ereignty has been a bipartisan objective 
since Russia’s military invasion in 2014. It 
must continue to be. 
Mr. Manager CROW. We help our 
partner fight Russia over there so we 
don’t have to fight Russia here—our 
friends on the frontlines, in trenches, 
and with sneakers. 
Following 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine in 2014, the United States has 
stood by Ukraine. Our diplomats and 
military commanders have long said

that supporting Ukraine makes us 
safer. But you don’t need me to tell 
you that; you all know it very well. 
When the funding for the security as-
sistance came up for a vote under this 
roof, 87 of you voted for the aid. 
Many of you have been staunch advo-
cates for Ukraine, working in a non-
partisan way to support our friends. 
That support makes a lot of sense be-
cause politics should not play a part in 
ensuring that Ukraine can battle Rus-
sian aggression and ensure that free-
dom wins in Europe. This body has, in 
so many ways, set that example. 
Protecting Europe from Russia is not 
a political game. Let me provide some 
background. In early 2014, in what be-
came known as the Revolution of Dig-
nity, 
Ukrainian 
citizens 
demanded 
democratic reforms and an end to cor-
ruption, ousting the pro-Russian Presi-
dent. Within days, Russian military 
forces 
and 
their 
proxies 
invaded 
Ukraine, annexing Crimea and occu-
pying portions of eastern Ukraine. 
Since 2014, more than 13,000 Ukrain-
ians have been killed because of the 
conflict and over 1.4 million have been 
forced from their homes. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the 
first attempt to redraw Europe’s border 
since World War II. 
In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense 
James Mattis summed it up well. He 
said: ‘‘Despite Russia’s denials, we 
know they are seeking to redraw inter-
national borders by force, undermining 
the sovereign and free nations of Eu-
rope.’’ 
And as Ambassador Taylor put it, 
Russian aggression in Ukraine ‘‘dis-
missed all the principles that have 
kept the peace and contributed to pros-
perity in Europe since World War II.’’ 
It is clear that Russia is not just a 
threat in Europe but for democracy 
and freedom around the world. Our 
friends and allies have also responded, 
imposing sanctions on Russia and pro-
viding billions of dollars in economic, 
humanitarian, and security assistance 
to Ukraine. This has been an inter-
national effort. 
Today, the European Union is the 
single largest contributor of foreign as-
sistance to Ukraine, having provided 
roughly $12 billion in grants and loans 
since 2014. The United States has pro-
vided over $3 billion in assistance in 
that time, because we all know that we 
can’t separate our own security from 
the security of our friends and allies. 
That is why the United States has pro-
vided economic security and humani-
tarian assistance in the form of equip-
ment and training. 
Ambassador Taylor testified that 
American aid is a concrete demonstra-
tion of our ‘‘commitment to resist ag-
gression and defend freedom.’’ He also 
detailed the many benefits of our as-
sistance for Ukraine’s forces. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the 
security assistance that we provide takes 
many forms. One of the components of that 
assistance is counter-battery radar. Another 
component are sniper weapons. 
These weapons and this assistance allows 
the Ukrainian military to deter further in-
cursions by the Russians against their own— 
against Ukrainian territory. If that further 
incursion, further aggression, were to take 
place, more Ukrainians would die. So it is a 
deterrent effect that these weapons provide. 
It’s also the ability—it gives the Ukrain-
ians the ability to negotiate from a position 
of a little more strength when they nego-
tiate an end to the war in Donbas, negoti-
ating with the Russians. This also is a way 
that would reduce the number of Ukrainians 
who would die. 
Mr. Manager CROW. I would like to 
make a finer point of how this type of 
aid helps because I know something 
about counter-battery radar. 
In 2005, I was an Army Ranger serv-
ing in a special operations task force in 
Afghanistan. We were at a remote oper-
ating base along the Afghan-Pakistan 
border. 
Frequently, 
the 
insurgence 
that we were fighting would launch 
rockets and missiles onto our small 
base. But, luckily, we were provided 
with counter-battery radar. So 20, 30, 40 
seconds before those rockets and mor-
tars rained down on us, an alarm would 
sound. We would run out from our 
tents and jump into our concrete bunk-
ers and wait for the attack to end. This 
is not a theoretical exercise, and the 
Ukrainians know it, for Ukraine aid 
from the United States actually con-
stitutes about 10 percent of their mili-
tary budget. It is safe to say that they 
can’t fight effectively without it. 
So there is no doubt. U.S. military 
assistance in Ukraine makes a real dif-
ference in the fight against Russia. 
In 2019, Congress provided $391 mil-
lion in security assistance. This in-
cluded $250 million through the Depart-
ment of Defense’s Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative, USAI, and $141 mil-
lion through the State Department’s 
Foreign Military Financing Program, 
FMF. 
President Trump signed the bill to 
authorize this aid in August 2018 and 
signed another bill to fund it the fol-
lowing month. The aid was underway. 
The train was leaving the station and 
following the same track it had fol-
lowed every single year. But all of this 
was about to change. 
In July of 2019, President Trump or-
dered the Office of Management and 
Budget, OMB, to put a hold on all of 
the aid. The President personally made 
this decision even after his own ap-
pointed advisers warned him that it 
wasn’t in our country’s interest to 
withhold the aid—after overwhelming 
support in this Senate—and against 
longstanding policy, even in his own 
administration. 
But what is most interesting to me 
about this is that he was only inter-
ested in the Ukraine aid, nobody else. 
The United States provides aid to doz-
ens of countries around the world, lots 
of partners and allies. He didn’t ask 
about any of them—just Ukraine. 
The most important question here is 
why would he do that? What was his 
motivation? Well, we now know why. 
This hold shocked people across our 
own government. The Department of 
Defense, along with the State Depart-
ment, had already certified to Congress 
that Ukraine had implemented suffi-
cient anti-corruption reforms to get 
the funds, and the Defense Department 
had already notified Congress of its in-
tent to deliver the assistance. 
So let’s recap all of this. Congress 
had already funded it. Our own govern-
ment had already certified that it met 
all of the standards that it met every 
other year, and Congress had already 
been notified, just like every other 
year. 
In a series of meetings of the Na-
tional Security Agency, everyone ex-
cept the OMB supported the provision 
of the assistance. OMB, as we know, is 
headed by Mick Mulvaney, the Presi-
dent’s Chief of Staff. 
Ukraine experts at DOD, the State 
Department, and the White House em-
phasized that it was in the national se-
curity interest of the United States to 
continue to support Ukraine in its 
fight. But it wasn’t just the national 
security concern, because many people 
thought that the hold was just outright 
illegal. And they were right. It was. 
The President’s hold did violate the 
law, because just last week, Congress’s 
independent, 
nonpartisan 
watchdog, 
the Government Accountability Office, 
released an opinion finding that the 
hold was illegal. 
President Trump held the military 
aid money for so long that the adminis-
tration ran out of time to spend the 
money. Ultimately, even after the 
President lifted the hold on September 
11—again, with no clear explanation 
why—we, the Congress, had to pass an-
other law to extend the deadline, de-
laying the delivery of the aid. 
In the same L.A. Times article that 
told the story about our friend Mr. 
Markiv, a Ukrainian defense spokes-
person said that even though the hold 
had been lifted—this was in Sep-
tember—it ‘‘has not reached us yet.’’ 
That spokesperson went on to say: ‘‘It 
is not just money from the bank. It is 
arms, equipment and hardware.’’ 
And to this day, millions of dollars 
still haven’t been spent. 
Although our government neither in-
formed Ukraine of the hold nor pub-
licly announced it, Ukraine quickly 
learned about it. 
On July 25, the same day as President 
Trump’s call with President Zelensky, 
officials at Ukraine’s Embassy here in 
Washington emailed DOD to ask about 
the status of the funding. By mid-Au-
gust, officials at DOD, the State De-
partment, and the NSC received nu-
merous questions from Ukrainian offi-
cials about the hold. Everyone was 
worried. It is not just because of the 
urgent need for the equipment on the 
frontlines but also because of the mes-
sage that it sent. You see, President 
Zelensky had just been sworn in. They 
were very vulnerable. And, as we all 
know, Vladimir Putin looks for vulner-
ability. He looks for hesitation. He 
looks for delay. And any public sign of 
a hold on that aid could be a sign of

weakness that could show him it was 
time to pounce. 
President Trump’s hold on Ukraine 
assistance was eventually publicly re-
ported on August 28. As we will ex-
plain, Ukraine fully understood that 
the hold was connected to the inves-
tigations that President Trump want-
ed. 
On February 28, DOD notified Con-
gress that it intended to deliver $125 
million of assistance appropriated in 
September, including ‘‘more than $50 
million 
of 
assistance 
to 
deliver 
counter-artillery radars and defense le-
thal assistance.’’ Congress cleared the 
notification, which enabled DOD to 
begin spending the funds. 
For Ukraine to receive the remaining 
$125 million, Congress required that the 
Secretary of Defense, in coordination 
with the Secretary of State, certify 
that the Government of Ukraine had 
taken substantial anti-corruption re-
forms. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Laura Cooper and senior officials 
across our government conducted a re-
view to evaluate whether Ukraine had 
met the required benchmarks. 
Ms. Cooper explained that the review 
involved ‘‘pulling in all the views of 
the key experts on Ukraine defense, 
and coming up with a consensus view,’’ 
which was then run ‘‘up the chain in 
the Defense Department, to ensure we 
have approval.’’ 
By May 23, the anti-corruption re-
view was complete, and DOD certified 
to Congress that Ukraine had complied 
with all of the conditions and that the 
remaining half of the aid should be re-
leased. But, again, you don’t have to 
take my word for it. On May 23, in a 
letter to Congress, one of President 
Trump’s senior political appointees, 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Pol-
icy, wrote: ‘‘On behalf of the Secretary 
of Defense, and in coordination with 
the Secretary of State, I have certified 
that the Government of Ukraine has 
taken substantial actions to make de-
fense institutional reforms for the pur-
poses of decreasing corruption, increas-
ing accountability, and sustaining im-
provements of combat capability en-
abled by U.S. assistance.’’ 
Congress then cleared the funding, 
which should have allowed Ukraine to 
receive the aid. But we know that is 
not what happened. 
On June 18, as DOD was preparing to 
send the aid, they issued a press re-
lease—as they normally do—announc-
ing that it would provide $250 million 
in security assistance to Ukraine ‘‘for 
additional training, equipment, and ad-
visory efforts to build the capacity of 
Ukraine’s armed forces.’’ This included 
sniper 
rifles, 
rocket-propelled 
gre-
nades, counter-artillery radars, com-
mand and control, electronic warfare, 
secure communications, vehicles, night 
vision, and medical equipment. How-
ever, according to the New York 
Times, 1 day after the Defense Depart-
ment issued this press release—1 day— 
Assistant to the President Robert 
Blair, who works for Mick Mulvaney, 
called OMB Acting Director Russell 
Vought to tell him: ‘‘We need to hold it 
up.’’ The ‘‘it’’ was the assistance. 
That same day, June 19, President 
Trump gave an interview on FOX News 
where 
he 
raised 
the 
so-called 
CrowdStrike conspiracy theory that 
Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in 
the 2016 election, a line he would echo 
during his July 25 call with President 
Zelensky. This theory, by the way, has 
been advanced by Russian propaganda 
to try to take attention away from 
Russian interference and shift it onto 
Ukraine. It is a theory that has been 
universally debunked by U.S. intel-
ligence and law enforcement. 
Nonetheless, the President, spurred 
by the June 18 press release and with 
the false theory about the Ukraine in-
terference, supposedly, in the 2016 elec-
tion, started asking about the Ukraine 
assistance. On June 19, OMB Associate 
Director for National Security Michael 
Duffey emailed Elaine McCusker, the 
DOD comptroller. He said the Presi-
dent had questions about the press re-
port and that he was seeking addi-
tional information. This was a ref-
erence to an article in the Washington 
Examiner, shown here on the slide in 
front of you. 
The White House withheld this email 
from the House, of course. We first 
learned of it from Duffey’s deputy, 
Mark Sandy, who testified that he was 
copied on it. Subsequently, as a result 
of a lawsuit under the Freedom of In-
formation Act, the public and, there-
fore, Congress received a copy of that 
email, but the White House still refuses 
to comply with the subpoenas for this 
and other documents. 
On June 20, McCusker responded to 
President Trump’s inquiry by pro-
viding Sandy information on the secu-
rity assistance program. Sandy shared 
the information with Duffey, but he did 
not know whether Duffey shared the 
information with the White House. 
Laura Cooper also recalled receiving an 
email inquiry about Ukraine’s security 
assistance ‘‘a few days’’ after DOD’s 
June 18 press release. She noted that it 
was ‘‘relatively unusual’’ to receive 
questions from the President. In re-
sponse, DOD provided materials ex-
plaining that the $250 million funding 
package was for additional training, 
equipment, and advisory efforts to 
build the capacity of Ukraine’s Armed 
Forces. DOD emphasized that ‘‘almost 
all of the dozens of vendors are U.S. 
companies,’’ meaning that this funding 
also benefited U.S. businesses and 
workers. 
Nonetheless, President Trump put 
the wheels in motion to freeze the 
funds shortly after learning about 
DOD’s plan to release the funds. Ac-
cording to a New York Times article on 
June 27, Chief of Staff Mulvaney 
emailed Blair: 
I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. 
Did we ever find out about the money from 
Ukraine and whether we can hold it back? 
Blair reportedly responded that it 
would be possible but not pretty. He 
added: ‘‘Expect Congress to become un-
hinged.’’ I suppose he said that for all 
the reasons we have talked about ear-
lier, because this Chamber and our 
Chamber on the other side of the Cap-
itol resoundingly supports it. 
And that was just the Defense De-
partment assistance to Ukraine. For 
2019, Congress also appropriated $141 
million to Ukraine through the State 
Department. Unlike the Defense De-
partment funding, which was approved 
by Congress and ready to be spent, 
OMB blocked the State Department 
from even seeking Congress’s approval 
to release the funds. 
I am going to pause here to, once 
again, stress that we have learned a lot 
about the circumstances around the 
initial hold only from the public re-
lease of and reporting about these 
emails in the past few weeks. The 
White House has refused to provide 
these emails in response to a subpoena. 
Mick Mulvaney and Rob Blair refused 
to comply with the subpoena to testify. 
These emails are just a few of the 
many thousands that likely exist on 
this topic but which have been con-
cealed from Congress and the American 
people because of ongoing obstruction. 
In fact, last night, as we were here late 
into the night, sometime around mid-
night, a new tranche of documents 
were released under a Freedom of In-
formation Act request by an inde-
pendent watchdog that had been asking 
for 
them—they 
were 
released 
last 
night—between Mr. Duffey and Elaine 
McCusker, and others, on the things 
that I am talking about right now. Un-
fortunately, as you can see, there isn’t 
a lot to read here because it is all 
blacked out. So, if the President’s law-
yers contest any of the facts that I am 
talking about, you should demand to 
see the full record. The American peo-
ple deserve to see the full truth when it 
comes to Presidential actions. 
Back to the timeline, from July to 
September of 2019, the President and 
his advisers at the White House and 
OMB implemented the hold on Ukraine 
assistance through an unusual and un-
lawful process. First, on July 3, the 
State Department notified DOD and 
NSC staff that OMB was blocking its 
notification to Congress. According to 
Jennifer 
Williams, 
Vice 
President 
PENCE’s aide, the hold on this assist-
ance ‘‘came out of the blue’’ because it 
had not been previously discussed by 
OMB or NSC. 
Around July 12, President Trump di-
rected that a hold be placed on the 
DOD security assistance as well. That 
day, Mr. Blair sent an email to Duffey 
at OMB informing him ‘‘that the Presi-
dent is directing a hold on military 
support funding for Ukraine.’’ 
Around 
July 
15, 
Tim 
Morrison 
learned from Deputy National Security 
Advisor Charles Kupperman ‘‘that it 
was the President’s direction to hold 
the assistance.’’ Several days later, 
Duffey and Blair again exchanged 
emails about Ukraine’s security assist-
ance, and Sandy testified that, in these

January 22, 2020 
emails, Duffey asked Blair about the 
reason for the hold. Blair provided no 
explanation. Instead, he said: ‘‘We need 
to let the hold take place’’ and then 
‘‘revisit’’ the issue with the President. 
Between July 18 and July 31, the NSC 
staff 
convened 
several 
interagency 
meetings at which the hold on security 
assistance was discussed. Remember 
those dates: July 18 to July 31. Accord-
ing to Mark Sandy and other wit-
nesses, several facts emerged. First, 
the agencies learned that the President 
himself had directed the hold through 
OMB. Second, no justification or expla-
nation was provided for the hold, de-
spite repeated questions. Third, except 
for OMB, all agencies were supporting 
military aid because it was in the na-
tional security interests of the United 
States. And fourth, many were con-
cerned that the hold was outright ille-
gal. 
Ambassador Taylor learned of the 
hold on July 18. He said the ‘‘directive 
had come from the President to the 
Chief of Staff to OMB’’ and that he 
‘‘sat in astonishment’’ because ‘‘one of 
the key pillars of our strong support 
for Ukraine was threatened.’’ 
David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. 
Embassy in Kyiv, testified that he was 
shocked by the hold. Although there 
was initially some question as to 
whether the hold applied to DOD funds, 
which was already cleared by Congress, 
it soon became clear that the hold ap-
plied to all $391 million. 
Tim Morrison testified that DOD offi-
cials raised concerns at a meeting on 
July 23 about whether it was ‘‘actually 
legally permissible for the President to 
not allow for the disbursement of the 
funding.’’ These concerns related to 
possible violations of the Impoundment 
Control Act, the law that gives a Presi-
dent the authority to delay or withhold 
funds only if Congress is notified of 
those intentions and approves the pro-
posed action. Of course, neither of 
those things had been done. The issue 
was escalated quickly, and at a senior- 
level meeting on July 26, OMB re-
mained the lone voice for holding the 
aid. According to Tim Morrison, OMB 
said that President Trump was con-
cerned about corruption in Ukraine. 
Cooper, from DOD, also attended the 
July meeting. She received no further 
understanding of what was meant by 
‘‘corruption.’’ There was never a prin-
cipals meeting convened on this issue, 
but there was a fourth and final inter-
agency meeting on July 31. Remember 
that date? A fourth and final one. 
There is a process for making sure 
that U.S. aid money makes it to the 
right place, to the right people. 
Mr. Chief Justice, I do see a lot of 
Members moving and taking a break. 
Would you like to take a break at this 
time? I have another, probably, 15 min-
utes. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think we can 
continue. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
if I may, what I was going to suggest 
was that at 6:30 we take a 30-minute 
break for dinner, if that would work. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. So break at 
6:30? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Yes. What I was 
going to suggest is a break for dinner 
at 6:30 for about 30 minutes, if that 
works. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. That is a good 
idea. 
Mr. Manager CROW. So we know 
there was a hold, but there was no law-
ful way to implement that hold. So the 
OMB had to use creative methods. 
There is a process for making sure that 
U.S. aid money makes it to the right 
place, to the right people—a process 
that had been followed every year since 
the Congress approved security assist-
ance to Ukraine. The administration 
needed to find a creative way of getting 
around that process. Later in the 
evening of July 25, the OMB found that 
way, even though DOD had already no-
tified Congress that the funds would be 
released. 
Here is how it worked. First, OMB 
issued guidance asserting that there 
was an ongoing review of assistance, 
even though none of the witnesses who 
testified were aware of any review of 
assistance. 
Second, 
OMB 
also 
at-
tempted to hide the hold in a series of 
technical footnotes in funding docu-
ments. And third, OMB’s leadership 
also transferred responsibility for ap-
proving funding obligations from ca-
reer civil servant Mark Sandy to a po-
litical appointee, Mark Duffey, some-
one with no relevant experience in this 
funding. 
Based on recent public reporting and 
documents DOD released under the 
Freedom 
of 
Information 
Act, 
we 
learned that on July 25, approximately 
90 minutes after President Trump’s 
phone call with President Zelensky, 
Mr. Duffey put this three-pronged plan 
into motion when he sent an email to 
senior DOD officials, copying Sandy. 
The email is in front of you. In this 
email, Duffey stated: Based on guid-
ance I have received and in light of the 
administration’s plan to review assist-
ance to Ukraine, please hold off on any 
additional DOD obligations of these 
funds, pending direction from that 
process. 
Duffey 
also 
underscored: 
‘‘Given the sensitive nature of the re-
quest, I appreciate your keeping that 
information closely held to those who 
need to know to execute the direc-
tion.’’ In other words, don’t tell any-
body about it. 
Later that day, Sandy approved and 
signed the first July 25 funding docu-
ment, which delayed funding until Au-
gust 5. Sandy testified that the purpose 
of this and subsequent footnotes ‘‘was 
to preclude obligation for a limited pe-
riod of time but enable planning and 
casework to continue.’’ Sandy also tes-
tified that his use of footnotes was un-
usual and that, in his 12 years of OMB 
experience he could ‘‘not recall another 
event like it.’’ 
On July 29, Duffey told Sandy he 
would no longer be responsible for ap-
proving the release of DOD Ukraine 
funding. This was only weeks after 
Sandy had raised questions about the 
legality of the President’s hold. Duffey 
also revoked the authority for approv-
ing the release of the State Depart-
ment funding from Sandy’s colleague 
at OMB. In short, Duffey assumed ap-
proval authority for all $391 million of 
the assistance. 
Over the next several weeks, with 
Duffey in charge, OMB continued to 
issue funding documents that kept 
kicking the can down the road, sup-
posedly to allow for an interagency 
process—and, 
remember, 
an 
inter-
agency 
process 
that 
had 
already 
wrapped up back in July—while insert-
ing the whole time footnotes through-
out the apportionment documents stat-
ing that the delay wouldn’t affect the 
program. Yet concerns continued to be 
relayed within DOD that it had. 
In total, OMB issued nine of these 
documents between July 25 and Sep-
tember 10. Even as OMB was imple-
menting the President’s hold, officials 
inside OMB advocated for the release of 
the funds. On August 7, OMB staff sent 
a memo to Director Vought recom-
mending removing the hold because the 
assistance was consistent with the na-
tional security strategy in terms of, 
one, supporting a stable, peaceful Eu-
rope; two, the fact that the aid coun-
tered Russian aggression; and, three, 
that there was bipartisan support for 
the program. This meant that experts 
at every single relevant agency in-
volved opposed the hold. 
By mid-August, DOD raised concerns 
that it might not be able to fully spend 
the DOD funds before the end of the fis-
cal year. Laura Cooper testified that 
DOD estimated that $100 million of aid 
was at risk of not getting to Ukraine. 
DOD concluded that it could no longer 
support OMB’s claim, in the footnotes, 
that ‘‘this brief pause in obligations 
will not preclude DOD’s timely execu-
tion of the final policy direction.’’ 
Sandy testified that this sentence in 
the footnotes was ‘‘at the heart of that 
issue about ensuring that we don’t run 
afoul of the Impoundment Control 
Act.’’ 
Records produced in response to a 
FOIA lawsuit show that Mr. Duffey and 
Ms. McCusker exchanged emails on Au-
gust 20, and on that date, OMB modi-
fied the footnote. These emails are al-
most entirely redacted; however, all 
the subsequent footnotes issued by 
OMB during the pendency of the hold 
removed this sentence regarding DOD’s 
ability to fully obligate the funds by 
the end of the fiscal year. Nevertheless, 
OMB continued to implement the hold 
at the President’s direction. We know 
from emails released last night that as 
of September 5, OMB was continuing to 
instruct DOD to hold the aid. OMB 
gave these emails to a private organi-
zation just because of a FOIA lawsuit. 
On September 5, Duffey emailed 
McCusker the following: 
No movement on Ukraine. Footnote forth-
coming to continue hold through Friday. 
We know that McCusker responded to 
OMB with a lengthy email detailing

DOD’s serious concerns, but OMB re-
dacted almost the whole thing. 
As I explained last night, OMB has 
key documents that President Trump 
has refused to turn over to Congress— 
key documents that go to the heart of 
one of the ways in which the President 
abused his power. 
Concerns about whether the adminis-
tration was bending, if not breaking, 
the law contributed to at least two 
OMB officials resigning, including an 
attorney in OMB. According to Sandy, 
one colleague specifically disagreed 
with OMB General Counsel about the 
application of the Impoundment Con-
trol Act. As I mentioned earlier, the 
independent and nonpartisan Govern-
ment Accountability Office has already 
said that the hold was illegal. But you 
remember the OMB correspondence ref-
erencing the ‘‘Interagency Process.’’ As 
we now know, there was no interagency 
process. It had ended months before. 
They made it up. They had to make it 
up because they couldn’t say the real 
reason for the hold. 
Sometime prior to August 6, Ambas-
sador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting 
with President Trump. According to 
Tim Morrison, at that meeting, the 
President ‘‘was not yet ready to ap-
prove the release of the assistance.’’ 
Ambassador Bolton instructed Morri-
son to look for other opportunities to 
get the President’s Cabinet together 
‘‘to have the direct, in-person con-
versation with the President about this 
topic.’’ Everyone was worried, includ-
ing the President’s National Security 
Advisor. 
In mid-August, Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman drafted a Presidential deci-
sion 
memorandum 
for 
Ambassador 
Bolton to present to President Trump 
for a decision on Ukraine security as-
sistance. 
The 
memorandum 
rec-
ommended that the hold be lifted. Mor-
rison testified that the memorandum 
was never provided to the President be-
cause of other competing issues. Morri-
son testified that a meeting with the 
President was never arranged in Au-
gust, reportedly because of scheduling 
problems. 
According to recent press reports, on 
August 30, Secretary of Defense Esper 
and Secretary of State Pompeo met 
with President Trump and implored 
him to release the security assistance 
because doing so was in the interest of 
the United States. However, President 
Trump continued to ignore everybody. 
Later that day, Duffey emailed Under 
Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker 
and 
wrote: 
‘‘Clear 
direction 
from 
POTUS to hold.’’ 
The Ukrainian Government knew of 
President Trump’s hold on security as-
sistance well before it was publicly re-
ported on August 28. This was not sur-
prising. U.S. diplomat Catherine Croft 
testified it was ‘‘inevitable that it was 
eventually going to come out.’’ 
She said that two individuals from 
the Ukrainian Embassy here in Wash-
ington approached her approximately a 
week apart ‘‘quietly and in confidence 
to ask me about an OMB hold on 
Ukraine 
security 
assistance.’’ 
She 
could not precisely recall the dates of 
these conversations but testified that 
she was ‘‘very surprised at the effec-
tiveness of my Ukrainian counter-
parts.’’ Everyone was worried. Why 
would these diplomats quietly make 
this inquiry? It is because if it had 
gone public, it would show that weak-
ness against Russia which was so con-
cerning to everybody involved. She 
said: ‘‘I think that if this were public 
in Ukraine, it would be seen as a rever-
sal of our policy . . . it would be a real-
ly big deal in Ukraine, and an expres-
sion of declining U.S. support for 
Ukraine. 
Meanwhile, Laura Cooper testified 
that DOD heard from the Ukrainian 
Embassy on July 25—the same day as 
President Trump’s call to President 
Zelensky. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
LAURA COOPER. On July 25th, a member 
of my staff got a question from a Ukraine 
Embassy contact asking what was going on 
with Ukraine security assistance, because at 
that time, we did not know what the guid-
ance was on USAI. The OMB notice of appor-
tionment arrived that day, but this staff 
member did not find out about it until later. 
I was informed that the staff member told 
the Ukrainian official that we were moving 
forward on USAI, but recommended that the 
Ukraine Embassy check in with State re-
garding the FMF.’’ 
Mr. Manager CROW. ‘‘USAI’’ referred 
to the $250 million that OMB blocked 
DOD from sending to Ukraine. ‘‘FMF’’ 
referred 
to 
the 
$141 
million 
they 
blocked from the State Department. 
On July 25, Cooper’s staff also re-
ceived two emails from the State De-
partment revealing that the Ukrainian 
Embassy was ‘‘asking about security 
assistance’’ and that ‘‘the Hill knows 
about the FMF . . . situation to an ex-
tent, and so does the Ukrainian em-
bassy.’’ One of Cooper’s staff members 
reported 
additional 
contacts 
with 
Ukrainian officials about the hold in 
August. 
Finally, we know the Ukrainians 
knew about the hold because the New 
York Times published an interview 
with the former Deputy Foreign Min-
ister of Ukraine, Olena Zerkal. She 
stated 
that 
she 
and 
President 
Zelensky’s office received a cable in 
late July informing them of the hold. 
In short, by the time of POLITICO’s 
report on August 28, the Ukrainians 
were well aware that the aid was not 
the only important official act the 
White House was withholding from 
them. The long-sought White House 
visit for President Zelensky was also in 
limbo. 
As all of this transpired, Ukrainian 
troops were still on the frontlines in 
eastern Ukraine, facing off against 
Russian-backed forces, dying in defense 
of their country. 
Ambassador Bill Taylor visited those 
Ukrainian troops on July 26. He re-
called seeing ‘‘the armed and hostile 
Russian-led force on the other side of 
the damaged bridge across the line of 
the contact.’’ When asked to reflect on 
that visit, here is what Ambassador 
Taylor had to say: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MALONEY. Let’s talk about July 26, a 
lot of years later. You go to the front, you go 
to Donbas with Ambassador Volker, I be-
lieve. And you’re on the bridge, and you’re 
looking over on the front line at the Russian 
soldiers. Is that what you recalled? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MALONEY. And you said the com-
mander there, the Ukrainian commander, 
thanked you for the American military as-
sistance that you knew was being withheld 
at that moment. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. That’s correct. 
Mr. MALONEY. How’d that make you feel, 
sir? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Badly. 
Mr. MALONEY. Why? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Because it was clear 
that that commander counted on us. It was 
clear that that commander had confidence in 
us. It was clear that that commander had 
what—was appreciative of the capabilities 
that he was given by that assistance but also 
the reassurance that we were supporting 
him. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Like me, Am-
bassador Taylor is a combat veteran. 
In fact, he was awarded a Bronze Star. 
Ambassador Taylor knew how vital our 
military aid was to those Ukrainian 
troops because he knows what it feels 
like to have people counting on you. 
Members of the U.S. Senate, I know 
you believe that aid is important, too, 
because 87 Members of this body voted 
to support it. President Trump did not 
think the aid was important last year. 
He ignored you and the direction of 
Congress. He betrayed the confidence 
of our Ukrainian partners and U.S. na-
tional security when he corruptly with-
held that aid. He did so because he sim-
ply wanted to help his own political 
campaign. Our men and women in uni-
form deserve better. Our friends and al-
lies deserve better. The American peo-
ple deserve better. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Jus-
tice Roberts, Senators, and counsel for 
the President, I want to talk to you 
about the White House meeting that 
President Trump offered to President 
Zelensky during their first phone call 
in April. But, as you know, that meet-
ing has not been scheduled. It was 
never scheduled. 
Ambassador Sondland testified that 
after the May 23 meeting with Presi-
dent Trump, it became clear that 
President Zelensky would not be in-
vited to the Oval Office until he an-
nounced the opening of investigations 
that would benefit President Trump’s 
reelection. During his testimony, Am-
bassador Sondland stressed that it was 
a clear quid pro quo. Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I know that 
members of this committee frequently frame 
these complicated issues in the form of a 
simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? 
As I testified previously with regard to the 
requested White House call and the White 
House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. 
Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Am-
bassador Volker, and others that President 
Trump wanted a public statement from

President Zelensky committing to investiga-
tions of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. 
Giuliani expressed those requests directly to 
the Ukrainians, and Mr. Giuliani also ex-
pressed those requests directly to us. We all 
understood that these prerequisites for the 
White House call and the White House meet-
ing reflected President Trump’s desires and 
requirements. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Sondland also testified that the 
scheme to pressure Ukraine into ful-
filling the President’s requirements for 
an Oval Office meeting became progres-
sively more specific and problematic— 
what he described as a ‘‘continuum of 
insidiousness.’’ He explained the evo-
lution from generic requests to inves-
tigate corruption to calls to pursue 
specific allegations against President 
Trump’s political opponents. 
Here is Ambassador Sondland again. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Well, Mr. Chair-
man, when we left the Oval Office, I believe 
on May 23, the request was very generic for 
an investigation of corruption in a very va-
nilla sense and dealing with some of the oli-
garch problems in Ukraine, which were long-
standing problems. And then as time went 
on, more specific items got added to the 
menu, including the Burisma and 2016 elec-
tion meddling, specifically the DNC server 
specifically. And over this continuum it be-
came more and more difficult to secure the 
White House meeting because more condi-
tions were being placed on the White House 
meeting. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. In short, 
Ambassadors Volker and Sondland un-
derstood that to get the meeting sched-
uled, they needed to get Mr. Giuliani’s 
agreement first. 
On June 27, Ambassador Sondland ex-
plained to Ambassador Taylor that 
President Trump needed to hear from 
the Ukrainian leader before he would 
consent to a White House meeting. 
Here is how Ambassador Taylor ex-
plained it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. On June 27th, Am-
bassador Sondland told me during a phone 
conversation that President Zelensky needed 
to make clear to President Trump that he, 
President Zelensky, was not standing in the 
way of investigations. 
Diplomat David Holmes testified that 
he understood, early on, the investiga-
tions to mean the Burisma-Biden in-
vestigations that Mr. Giuliani and his 
associates had been speaking about 
publicly. Mr. Holmes noted that while 
President Trump was withholding an 
Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s 
newly elected leader, he agreed to meet 
with Ukraine’s chief foe, Vladimir 
Putin. 
Mr. Holmes had this to say: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. Also on June 28th, while 
President Trump was still not moving for-
ward on a meeting with President Zelensky, 
we met with—he met with Russian President 
Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, 
sending a further signal of lack of support to 
Ukraine. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Volker did not dispute other wit-
nesses’ 
testimony 
that 
President 
Trump conditioned an Oval Office 
meeting on President Zelensky’s will-
ingness to announce investigations. In-
deed, Ambassador Volker helped mat-
ters along. Ambassador Volker testi-
fied that at a conference in early July, 
he suggested that President Zelensky 
speak to President Trump on the phone 
to discuss the investigations. 
During his testimony, Ambassador 
Volker described that encounter. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Uh-huh. And in the July 
2nd or 3rd meeting in Toronto that you had 
with President Zelensky, you also mentioned 
investigations to him, right? 
Ambassador VOLKER. Yes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, again, you were re-
ferring to the Burisma and the 2016 election. 
Ambassador VOLKER. I was thinking of 
Burisma and 2016. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Okay. And you understood 
that is what the Ukrainians interpreted ref-
erences to investigations to be, related to 
Burisma and the 2016 election? 
Ambassador VOLKER. I don’t know spe-
cifically at that time if we had talked that, 
specifically, Burisma/2016. That was my as-
sumption, though, that they would’ve been 
thinking about doing that, too. 
Mrs. 
Manager 
DEMINGS. 
Mr. 
Giuliani became an inescapable pres-
ence to both Ukrainian officials and 
American diplomats. To the Ukrain-
ians, Rudy Giuliani was seen as both a 
potential channel to President Trump 
and an obstacle to a productive U.S.- 
Ukraine relationship. 
A top aide to President Zelensky 
texted to Volker that ‘‘I feel that the 
key for many things is Rudi and I [am] 
ready to talk with him at any time.’’ 
But everyone understood that Mr. 
Giuliani was no rogue agent. He was 
acting at the direction of the Presi-
dent. Ambassador Sondland clearly de-
scribed Mr. Giuliani’s role in regard to 
the President. Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani’s 
requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a 
White House visit for President Zelensky. 
Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a 
public statement announcing the investiga-
tions of the 2016 election, DNC server, and 
Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the de-
sires of the President of the United States, 
and we knew these investigations were im-
portant to the President. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Concern 
about Mr. Giuliani’s influence began to 
grow. On July 10, at a meeting between 
Ambassador Taylor and two Ukrainian 
officials in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials 
said they were ‘‘very concerned’’ be-
cause Mr. Giuliani had told the corrupt 
prosecutor 
general, 
Lutsenko, 
that 
President Trump would not meet with 
the Ukrainian leader. 
Back in Washington, two important 
encounters at the White House further 
revealed the existence of a corrupt quid 
pro quo. Ambassador Sondland first 
broached the investigation in a meet-
ing in Ambassador Bolton’s office with 
Bolton’s Ukrainian counterpart and 
President Zelensky’s top aide. Also 
present were Secretary Perry, Ambas-
sador Volker, and NSC officials Dr. Hill 
and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. To-
ward the end of the meeting, the 
Ukrainians raised the topic of an Oval 
Office 
meeting 
between 
President 
Trump and President Zelensky. Ambas-
sador Bolton started to respond when 
Ambassador Sondland interjected and 
raised the demands of the investiga-
tion. 
Here 
is 
how 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman recalled the conversation: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. VINDMAN. To the best of my recollec-
tion, Ambassador Sondland said that in 
order to get a White House meeting, the 
Ukrainians would have to provide a deliver-
able, which is investigations, specific inves-
tigations. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Volker separately confirmed this 
recollection during his testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the 
July 10 meeting between National Security 
Advisor Bolton and then-Ukrainian Chair-
man of the National Security and Defense 
Council, Alex Danyliuk. As I remember, the 
meeting was essentially over when Ambas-
sador Sondland made a general comment 
about investigations. I think all of us 
thought it was inappropriate. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Bolton also found Ambassador 
Sondland’s reference to be inappro-
priate, and he abruptly ended the meet-
ing. However, Ambassador Sondland 
was not deterred. He convened a second 
meeting where he discussed what need-
ed to happen before an Oval Office 
meeting. 
Apparently, 
Ambassador 
Sondland had received his marching or-
ders from the President, and he was de-
termined to carry them out. 
Bolton sent Dr. Hill to join that 
meeting and report back. This is what 
Dr. Hill had to say: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon 
Sondland was basically saying, well, look, we 
have a deal here that there will be a meet-
ing—I have a deal here with Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the 
Ukrainians open up or announce these inves-
tigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I cut it 
off immediately there. Because by this point, 
having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over 
again on the television and all of the issues 
that he was asserting, by this point it was 
clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens 
because Giuliani was laying it out there. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. After the 
meeting, Dr. Hill followed up with Am-
bassador Bolton and relayed what tran-
spired. Bolton was alarmed. In other 
words, Ambassador Bolton didn’t want 
any part of it. He directed Dr. Hill to 
brief the NSC’s top attorney, John 
Eisenberg, as she explained during her 
hearing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. What was that specific in-
struction? 
Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was 
that I have to go to the lawyers, to John 
Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the Na-
tional Security Council, to basically say, 
you tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told 
me, that I am not part of this whatever drug 
deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cook-
ing up. 
GOLDMAN. What did you understand him 
to mean by the drug deal that Mulvaney and 
Sondland were cooking up? 
Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting.

S467 
January 22, 2020 
GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the law-
yers? 
Dr. HILL. I certainly did. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. As a former 
chief of police, I think it is quite inter-
esting that Ambassador Bolton cat-
egorized the corrupt scheme—the pres-
sure campaign—as a ‘‘drug deal.’’ I 
think Ambassador Bolton was trying 
to send us a very powerful message 
that not only would the lawyers, the 
top lawyer understand, but that every 
person would understand—every Mem-
ber of the House, every Member of the 
Senate, every member of our great 
country, every citizen. 
And Ambassador Bolton also wanted 
to make clear, especially to the top at-
torney, that he did not want to have 
anything to do with the drug deal in 
progress. But we do know now, of 
course, that Ambassador Bolton can 
testify directly about this. He can tes-
tify directly for himself about this 
meeting if he appears before this body, 
as he has indicated that he is prepared 
to do if this body is willing to issue a 
subpoena. We need to hear from Am-
bassador Bolton, and I know the Amer-
ican people want to hear from Ambas-
sador Bolton as well. 
Dr. Hill testified that she spoke to 
Mr. Eisenberg twice. Dr. Hill also indi-
cated that Mr. Eisenberg took notes of 
their meeting, which we, to no surprise 
now, do not have. We have not received 
them because of the President’s ob-
struction. 
It is clear that Ambassador Sondland 
was not operating a rogue operation. 
He testified that everyone was in the 
loop. Let’s listen once again. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Everyone was in 
the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was in-
formed via email on July 19th, days before 
the Presidential call. As I communicated to 
the team, I told President Zelensky in ad-
vance that assurances to run a fully trans-
parent investigation and turn over every 
stone were necessary in his call with Presi-
dent Trump. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. In the 
email reference, Ambassador Sondland 
wrote 
the 
following 
to 
Secretary 
Pompeo, Secretary Perry, and Mr. 
Mulvaney 
regarding 
President 
Zelensky. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
He is prepared to receive POTUS’ call. Will 
assure him that he intends to run a fully 
transparent investigation and will ‘‘turn 
over every stone.’’ 
Both Mulvaney and Perry responded 
to the email noting that the head-of- 
state call would be scheduled right 
away. Now, you may be asking: What 
did Mulvaney know about these inves-
tigations, and did he have any con-
versations with President Trump about 
them? 
Senators, this body is entitled to see 
all of the evidence, and do you know 
what? The American people are enti-
tled to hear all of the evidence. And 
while the nature of the ‘‘drug deal’’ we 
have talked about was uncontested, it 
is important for the country to know 
that everyone was involved because we 
have heard that everyone was in the 
loop. 
Now, later this day, July 19, Ambas-
sador Sondland texted Ambassadors 
Volker and Taylor about the upcoming 
head-of-state telephone call, and the 
text said: 
Looks like Potus call tomorrow. I [spoke] 
directly to Zelensky and gave him a full 
briefing. He’s got it. 
Ambassador 
Volker 
replied 
to 
Sondland’s text: ‘‘Most [important] is 
for Zelensky to say that he will help 
investigations.’’ 
The evidence shows that the Ukrain-
ians understood what they needed to do 
to earn a White House meeting with 
the President. 
On July 20, the day after Ambassador 
Sondland’s phone call with President 
Zelensky, Ambassador Taylor spoke 
with the Ukrainian national security 
advisor. Ukraine’s national security 
advisor conveyed that the Ukrainian 
President did not want to become an 
instrument in U.S. politics. 
Here is how Ambassador Taylor ex-
plained that concern: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. What did you understand it to 
mean when—that Zelensky had concerns 
about being an instrument in Washington 
domestic reelection politics? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk un-
derstood that these investigations were pur-
suant to Mr. Giuliani’s request to develop in-
formation, 
to 
find 
information 
about 
Burisma and the Bidens. This was very well 
known in public. Mr. Giuliani made his point 
clear in several instances in the beginning— 
in the springtime. 
And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was 
a problem. 
GOLDMAN. And would you agree that, be-
cause President Zelensky is worried about 
this, they understood, at least, that there 
was some pressure for them to pursue these 
investigations? Is that fair? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk indi-
cated that President Zelensky certainly un-
derstood it, that he did not want to get in-
volved in these types of activities. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The next 
day, Ambassador Taylor relayed the 
Ukrainian leader’s concerns to Volker 
and 
Sondland, 
but 
Ambassador 
Sondland did not back down. 
Specifically, Ambassador Sondland 
texted in response to Ambassador Tay-
lor’s worry: ‘‘Absolutely, but we need 
to get the conversation started and the 
relationship built, irrespective of the 
pretext.’’ 
Again, Ambassador Sondland had his 
marching orders, and he was deter-
mined to carry them out. 
A call between President Trump and 
President Zelensky was scheduled for 
July 25. 
Before the call, President Trump 
spoke to Sondland and reiterated his 
expectation that the Ukrainian leader 
would commit to the investigations. 
Ambassador Sondland subsequently 
contacted Ambassador Volker and re-
layed the message to him. 
Volker then texted Zelensky’s top 
aide with President Trump’s instruc-
tion: ‘‘[A]ssuming President Z con-
vinces trump he will investigate / ‘get 
to the bottom of what happened’ in 
2016, we will nail down the date for a 
visit to Washington.’’ 
Senators, in other words, even before 
the July 25 phone call with President 
Zelensky, before it ever took place, 
Ukraine understood that it needed to 
initiate the investigation into the de-
bunked conspiracy theory about the 
2016 election as a condition for Presi-
dent 
Zelensky, 
the 
newly 
elected 
Ukrainian President, to visit the White 
House. 
Ambassador Sondland testified that 
acting on President Trump’s direct or-
ders, 
he 
and 
Ambassador 
Volker 
prepped President Zelensky for the 
telephone call. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. And you would agree that the 
message in this—that is expressed here is 
that President Zelensky needs to convince 
Trump that he will do the investigations in 
order to nail down the date for a visit to 
Washington, D.C. Is that correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s correct. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. By this 
time, nonpartisan career officials in-
volved with Ukraine policy had become 
aware of this quid pro quo. 
Here is what three of them said dur-
ing their testimony: 
Ambassador Taylor: ‘‘. . . the meet-
ing President Zelensky wanted was 
conditioned 
on 
investigations 
of 
Burisma and alleged Ukrainian influ-
ence in the 2016 elections . . .’’ 
Ambassador David Holmes: ‘‘. . . it 
was made clear that some action on a 
Burisma/Biden investigation was a pre-
condition for an Oval Office visit.’’ 
Dr. Hill: ‘‘There seems to be an awful 
lot of people involved in, you know, ba-
sically turning a White House meeting 
into some kind of asset’’ that was 
‘‘dangled out to the Ukrainian Govern-
ment.’’ 
A White House visit—a visit to the 
Oval Office—was dangled out to the 
Ukrainian Government. 
Senators, I ask you to think about 
those words as we decide—as you de-
cide—what action you will take. Think 
about those words. There was no doubt 
the direction came from the President 
of the United States. The President 
was at the center of this scheme. 
Ambassador Sondland testified: ‘‘Mr. 
Giuliani was expressing the desires of 
the President of the United States, and 
we knew these investigations were im-
portant to the President.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland added that Mr. 
Giuliani ‘‘followed the direction of the 
President’’ and ‘‘we followed the Presi-
dent’s orders.’’ 
However, as Ambassador Taylor tes-
tified, ‘‘Ambassador Bolton was not in-
terested in having—did not want to 
have the call because he thought it was 
going to be a disaster.’’ He thought 
that there could be some talk of inves-
tigations or even worse than that, he 
thought. 
I ask you today, Senators: What was 
Ambassador Bolton so afraid that 
President Trump would say to the 
newly elected Ukrainian President?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S468 
January 22, 2020 
What was the National Security Advi-
sor so afraid that President Trump 
would say to President Zelensky? 
This is another topic we would like 
to ask Ambassador Bolton about if and 
when he appears before this body. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, I thank you, once again, for 
your indulgence and for your courtesy 
as we all undertake our solemn con-
stitutional responsibilities during this 
Senate trial. 
George Washington once observed in 
his Farewell Address to the Nation 
that the Constitution was sacredly 
obligatory upon all. That means every-
one. In fact, that is what makes our 
great country so distinct from authori-
tarian regimes and enemies of democ-
racy. Vladimir Putin is above the law 
in Russia; Erdogan is above the law in 
Turkey; Kim Jong Un is above the law 
in North Korea, but in the United 
States of America, no one is above the 
law, not even the President of the 
United States. That is what this mo-
ment is all about. 
As we all know, Congress is a sepa-
rate and coequal branch of govern-
ment. We don’t work for this President 
or any President. We, of course, work 
for the American people. We have a 
constitutional responsibility to serve 
as a check and balance on an out-of- 
control executive branch. That is not 
from the Democratic Party’s playbook, 
and that is not from the Republican 
Party’s playbook. That is from the 
playbook of a democratic republic. 
James Madison once observed in Fed-
eralist No. 51 that the Congress should 
serve as a rival to the executive 
branch. 
In my humble opinion, why would 
Madison use the word ‘‘rival’’? 
It is that the Framers of the Con-
stitution, I think, did not want a King; 
they did not want a dictator; they did 
not want a Monarch. They wanted a de-
mocracy. The Constitution is sacredly 
obligatory upon all. It is through that 
lens that we proceed today. 
For the next few moments, I would 
like to discuss President Trump’s July 
25 phone call with Ukraine’s newly 
elected leader. 
The President claims that his call 
was perfect. Nothing can be further 
from the truth. The call is direct evi-
dence of President Trump’s solicitation 
of foreign interference in the 2020 elec-
tion as part of a corrupt scheme. It is 
important, of course, to remember the 
context of this call. 
New Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky was in a vulnerable position 
and viewed American and diplomatic 
military support as critical to his 
standing and to Ukraine’s fragile fu-
ture as a democracy. Equally signifi-
cant, as outlined by my colleagues, 
America has a strong national security 
interest in supporting Ukraine against 
Russia’s continued aggression. 
William Taylor, a West Point grad-
uate, a Vietnam war hero, and Ambas-
sador to Ukraine, appointed by Donald 
Trump, testified: ‘‘Ukraine is a stra-
tegic partner of the United States—im-
portant for the security of our country 
as well as Europe.’’ 
LTC Alexander Vindman, a National 
Security Council officer, a Trump ap-
pointee, a Purple Heart recipient, an 
Iraq war veteran, testified: ‘‘A strong 
and independent Ukraine is critical to 
our national security interests.’’ 
Ukraine remains under attack by 
Russian-backed separatists in Crimea. 
It is an ongoing hot war. Ukraine is a 
friend. Russia is a foe. Ukraine is a de-
mocracy. Russia is a dictatorship. The 
United States may very well be one of 
the other things standing between Rus-
sia and Ukraine’s being completely 
overrun. As part of that, Vladimir 
Putin continues aggression against the 
free world. That is why this Congress 
allocated $391 million in military and 
security aid to a vulnerable Ukraine on 
a bipartisan basis. It is that it is in 
America’s national security interests. 
On the July 25 call, Mr. Trump could 
have endeavored to strengthen the re-
lationship with this new Ukrainian 
leader. Instead, President Trump fo-
cused on securing a personal favor. He 
wanted Ukraine to conduct phony in-
vestigations, designed to enhance his 
political standing and solicit foreign 
interference in the 2020 election. 
On the July 25 call, President Trump 
maligned a highly respected American 
Ambassador, known as an anti-corrup-
tion crusader. At the same time, he 
praised a corrupt former Ukrainian 
prosecutor, and on multiple occasions, 
President Trump directed Ukraine’s 
new leader to speak with his personal 
lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, on an official 
call. 
Mr. Giuliani is not a member of the 
Trump administration. For these and 
other reasons, the July 25 call warrants 
our close scrutiny. It presents signifi-
cant and shocking evidence of Presi-
dent Trump’s corrupt intent. The call 
lays bare the President’s willingness to 
do whatever it takes to get what he 
wants even if his behavior undermines 
the national security interests of the 
United States of America. 
At the beginning of the call, Presi-
dent Zelensky mentioned U.S. military 
aid, and he states: ‘‘I would also like to 
thank you for your great support in the 
area of defense.’’ The great support in 
the area of defense includes the secu-
rity assistance passed by this Congress, 
on a bipartisan basis, that Donald 
Trump held up in violation of the law. 
Immediately 
after 
President 
Zelensky raised the issue of defense 
support, President Trump responded: 
‘‘I would like you to do us a favor, 
though.’’ 
These words will live in infamy. 
First, President Trump said to Presi-
dent Zelensky, as part of the two de-
mands that he requested: 
I would like you to find out what happened 
with this whole situation with Ukraine, they 
say Crowdstrike . . . I guess you have one of 
your wealthy people. . . . The server, they 
say, Ukraine has it.’’ 
President Trump continued: 
I would like to have the Attorney General 
call you or your people, and I would like you 
to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yester-
day, that whole nonsense ended with a very 
poor performance by a man named Robert 
Mueller— 
A Vietnam war hero, by the way— 
a very poor performance by a man named 
Robert Mueller, an incompetent perform-
ance, but they say a lot of it started with 
Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very im-
portant that you do it if that’s possible. 
Who is the ‘‘they’’ referred to by 
President Trump putting forth the 
baseless conspiracy theory that the 
Ukrainians, not the Russians, were be-
hind the hack of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee server in 2016? 
‘‘They’’ means Russia. ‘‘They’’ means 
Putin. ‘‘They’’ are enemies of the 
United States. 
Not a single witness who testified be-
fore the House knew of any factual 
basis for President Trump’s belief in 
the CrowdStrike Ukraine fairytale. To 
the contrary, the U.S. intelligence 
community and this Senate Intel-
ligence Committee assessed that Rus-
sia interfered in the 2016 election. 
As Dr. Fiona Hill testified, the the-
ory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 
election ‘‘is a fictional narrative that 
has been perpetrated and propagated 
by the Russian security services.’’ 
The conspiracy theory that President 
Trump advanced on the July 25 phone 
call is stone-cold Russian propaganda. 
As early as February 2017, Vladimir 
Putin began to promote this lie during 
a press conference saying: 
The Ukrainian Government adopted a uni-
lateral position in favor of one candidate. 
More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly 
with the approval of the political leadership, 
funded this candidate, or female candidate, 
to be more precise. 
Those are the words of Vladimir 
Putin—a script apparently adopted by 
President Donald John Trump. 
If there was any doubt about who 
benefits from this unfounded, Russian- 
inspired conspiracy theory advanced by 
Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin made it 
clear when he said in November of 2019: 
Thank God no one is accusing us anymore 
of interfering in U.S. elections. Now they’re 
accusing Ukrainians. 
Unfortunately, this is not the first 
time President Trump tried to cap-
italize on Russian propaganda and mis-
information for his own political ben-
efit. 
On July 24, just one day before this 
call, Special Counsel Robert Mueller 
testified 
before 
Congress 
that 
the 
‘‘Russian government interfered in the 
2016 election in sweeping and system-
atic fashion’’ in order to support the 
Trump campaign and divide America. 
Mr. Mueller also found that the 
Trump campaign welcomed Russian in-
terference in the 2016 election and uti-
lized it as part of its campaign mes-
saging. 
Despite the clear and overwhelming 
conclusion of U.S. intelligence agen-
cies, as well as the distinguished Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee, that Rus-
sia, not Ukraine interfered in the 2016

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S469 
January 22, 2020 
election, President Trump continued to 
press the new Ukrainian leader to an-
nounce 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
CrowdStrike Ukraine conspiracy the-
ory. 
Why? President Trump sought a po-
litical favor—that is why—as part of a 
scheme to solicit foreign interference 
in the 2020 election. 
The second demand made by Presi-
dent Trump on the July 25 call related 
to the campaign of Vice President Joe 
Biden, who announced his intention to 
run for the Office of the Presidency 
last April. Throughout the spring and 
early summer of last year, public poll-
ing consistently showed that Biden 
would 
decisively 
defeat 
President 
Trump. In fact, on June 16 of last 
year—June 
16—a 
FOX 
News 
poll 
showed that President Trump would 
lose to Joe Biden by 10 points. 
The concern with Joe Biden’s can-
didacy provides motive for President 
Trump’s demand that the Ukrainian 
Government investigate the former 
Vice President and his son Hunter. 
Here is what President Trump said 
on that call: 
The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about 
Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecu-
tion and a lot of people want to find out 
about that so whatever you can do with the 
Attorney General would be great. Biden went 
around bragging that he stopped the prosecu-
tion so if you can look into it . . . It sounds 
horrible to me. 
Now, the Trump administration offi-
cials who participated in the impeach-
ment inquiry unanimously testified 
that there was no factual support for 
the allegation that Vice President 
Biden did anything wrong or misused 
his authority when he pressed for the 
removal of Ukraine’s corrupt former 
prosecutor general. Joe Biden did noth-
ing wrong. The witnesses testified that 
Vice President Biden was in fact car-
rying out official U.S. policy to clean 
up the prosecutor general’s office in 
Ukraine. 
This policy, of course, aligned with 
the perspective of many in this very 
distinguished body, as well as our Eu-
ropean allies throughout the world, as 
well as the International Monetary 
Fund. 
Vice President Biden did not remove 
Yuriy Lutsenko, the corrupt pros-
ecutor. The Ukrainian Government did 
with the support of the free world. 
Nonetheless, on October 3, 2019, when 
a reporter asked President Trump, 
‘‘What exactly did you hope Zelensky 
would do about the Bidens after your 
phone 
call,’’ 
President 
Trump 
re-
sponded as follows. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
News Reporter. What exactly did you hope 
Zelensky would do about the Bidens after 
your phone? Exactly? 
President TRUMP. Well, I would think 
that, if they were honest about it, they’d 
start a major investigation into the Bidens. 
It’s a very simple answer. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Start a 
major investigation into the Bidens. 
The evidence of wrongdoing by Presi-
dent Trump is hiding in plain sight. 
During the July 25 call, President 
Trump also repeatedly pressed the 
Ukrainian President to coordinate with 
his 
personal 
attorney, 
Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
Why was Rudolph Giuliani’s name 
mentioned multiple times during the 
July 25 phone call? Giuliani is not the 
Secretary of State. He is not an ambas-
sador. He is not a member of the diplo-
matic corps. 
Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded 
political 
operative 
for 
President 
Trump’s reelection campaign. That is 
why he was referenced multiple times 
on that July 25 phone call, and it is 
evidence of corrupt intent by President 
Trump. 
By the time the call took place, 
President 
Zelensky 
understood 
Giuliani’s connection to the shakedown 
scheme. He recognized Giuliani’s role 
as the President’s political operative 
on matters related to Ukraine. 
Zelensky informed President Trump 
that one of his aides spoke with Mr. 
Giuliani ‘‘just recently’’ and ‘‘we are 
hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani 
will be able to travel to Ukraine and 
we will meet once he comes.’’ 
The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani 
represented President Trump’s polit-
ical interests in his country and could 
help unlock the long-sought-after Oval 
Office meeting that President Zelensky 
desired. 
The phony investigations sought by 
President Trump on the July 25 call 
were not designed to bolster the na-
tional security interests of the United 
States of America—quite the contrary. 
President Trump sought to benefit 
himself and his own reelection pros-
pects. 
On the July 25 call, President Trump 
also suggested that President Zelensky 
speak with the Attorney General Wil-
liam Barr about the two fake inves-
tigations that the President sought. 
This is important to keep in mind. At 
no time during this entire sordid 
scheme was there an ongoing American 
law enforcement investigation into the 
phony slander related to Joe Biden or 
the 
conspiracy 
theory 
related 
to 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion. At no time was there an ongoing 
American law enforcement investiga-
tion. 
America is the leader of the free 
world. We do not urge other sovereign 
countries to target American citizens 
absent any legitimate basis whatso-
ever, absent any scintilla of evidence. 
Apparently, President Trump does 
not play by those rules. During the 
July 25 call, President Trump didn’t 
raise legitimate corruption concerns as 
it relates to the Ukraine. President 
Trump did not mention the word ‘‘cor-
ruption’’ once. The President did, how-
ever, viciously malign former U.S. Am-
bassador 
to 
Ukraine 
Marie 
Yovanovitch, 
a 
distinguished 
anticorruption 
advocate 
whom 
he 
abruptly removed because she was seen 
as an obstacle to his geopolitical 
shakedown. 
Ambassador Yovanovitch joined the 
diplomatic corps under President Ron-
ald Reagan and subsequently served 
three other Republican Presidents. She 
is a highly respected diplomat and For-
eign Service professional. Yet Presi-
dent Trump told the new Ukrainian 
leader the former Ambassador from the 
United States, ‘‘the woman,’’ was bad 
news, and the people she was dealing 
with in the Ukraine were bad news. 
‘‘So I just want to let you know that.’’ 
He didn’t stop there. Later in the 
call, 
President 
Trump 
ominously 
added, ‘‘Well, she’s going to go through 
some things.’’ These are the words of 
the President of the United States of 
America. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
did 
not 
know of President Trump’s disparaging 
remarks at the time. She didn’t learn 
them until the call record became pub-
lic in September. Asked whether she 
felt 
‘‘threatened’’ 
by 
President 
Trump’s statement that ‘‘she’s going 
to go through some things,’’ Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch answered that she 
did. Here is what she said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. The next excerpt when the 
President references you is a short one, but 
he said: ‘‘Well, she’s going to go through 
some things.’’ What did you think when 
President Trump told President Zelensky 
and you read that you were going to go 
through some things? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I didn’t know 
what to think, but I was very concerned. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What were you concerned 
about? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. She’s going 
to go through some things. It didn’t sound 
good. It sounded like a threat. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you feel threatened? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I did. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. During that 
same call, President Trump also took 
the 
opportunity 
to 
praise 
Yuriy 
Lutsenko—Mr. Lutsenko, who is the 
former Ukrainian prosecutor general 
who was widely regarded by the entire 
free world, including our European al-
lies and the International Monetary 
Fund, to be corrupt and incompetent, 
but Donald John Trump, our President, 
praised him on that call. 
He told President Zelensky: 
I heard you had a prosecutor who was very 
good and he was shut down and that’s really 
unfair. A lot of people are talking about 
that, the way they shut your very good pros-
ecutor down and you had some very bad peo-
ple involved. 
Think about this contrast. The Presi-
dent bashed a career American dip-
lomat and an anti-corruption champion 
whom he unceremoniously removed be-
cause she was viewed as an obstacle to 
his efforts to solicit foreign inter-
ference in the 2020 election and then at 
the same time praised someone who he 
thought could be an asset—a former 
Ukrainian prosecutor whom the free 
world views as an obstacle to the rule 
of law. The idea that President Trump 
cares about corruption is laughable. It 
is laughable. 
A plain reading of the rough tran-
script of the July 25 call also sheds 
light on the quid pro quo involving the

January 22, 2020 
Oval Office meeting that had been 
sought. 
President Zelensky said on the call: 
I also wanted to thank you for your invita-
tion to visit the United States, specifically 
Washington, DC. On the other hand, I also 
wanted to ensure you that we will be very se-
rious about the case and will work on the in-
vestigation. 
As all of you know here in this dis-
tinguished body, quid pro quo is a 
Latin term. It means ‘‘this for that.’’ 
The statement that I just read shows 
that President Zelensky fully under-
stood at the time of this July 25 call 
that if he yielded to President Trump’s 
demand for phony investigations, he 
would get the White House meeting in 
the Oval Office that he desperately 
sought. This for that. 
President Trump has repeatedly in-
sisted that his July 25 conversation 
with President Zelensky was ‘‘a perfect 
call.’’ His staff at the White House ap-
parently believed otherwise. The press 
office issued a short and incomplete 
summary of the July 25 call. Let me 
read it for your hearing: 
Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke 
by telephone with President Volodymyr 
Zelensky of Ukraine— 
(Disturbance in the Galleries.) 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. And the 
scripture says: ‘‘For the Lord loves jus-
tice and will not abandon His faithful 
ones.’’ 
This is the White House call readout 
of July 25, 2019: 
Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke 
by telephone with President Volodymyr 
Zelensky of Ukraine to congratulate him on 
his recent election. President Trump and 
President 
Zelensky 
discussed 
ways 
to 
strengthen the relationship between the 
United States and Ukraine, including energy 
and economic cooperation. Both leaders also 
expressed that they look forward to the op-
portunity to meet. 
That is the official White House read-
out of the call dated July 25, 2019. The 
official readout provided to the Amer-
ican people omitted key elements of 
the President’s conversation. Let’s re-
view. 
The official readout did not mention 
the phony investigations requested by 
President Trump. The official readout 
did not mention the Oval Office meet-
ing sought by President Zelensky. The 
official readout did not mention Presi-
dent Trump’s elevation of a debunked 
conspiracy theory promoted by Vladi-
mir Putin about 2016 election inter-
ference. The official readout did not 
mention President Trump’s demand 
that Ukraine investigate his domestic 
political rival, Joe Biden. The official 
readout did not mention that President 
Trump maligned and threatened Am-
bassador 
Yovanovitch. 
The 
official 
readout did not mention that President 
Trump 
praised 
a 
corrupt 
former 
Ukrainian prosecutor. 
The complete conversation, however, 
between President Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky that we just outlined of-
fers powerful evidence that President 
Trump abused his power and solicited 
foreign interference in the 2020 elec-
tion. 
Several members of the President’s 
staff listening in on the call imme-
diately grew concerned. 
As he sat in the White House Situa-
tion Room listening to the conversa-
tion, LTC Alexander Vindman realized 
that the President’s demands of the 
Ukrainian leader were ‘‘inappropriate’’ 
and ‘‘improper.’’ He quickly recognized 
that as the President began referencing 
the Bidens, Burisma, and CrowdStrike, 
the call was diverging from the official 
National 
Security 
Council 
talking 
points that he helped prepare. 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, a 20- 
year Iraq war veteran, Purple Heart re-
cipient, and American patriot, testified 
in the context of the call that due to 
the unequal bargaining position of the 
two leaders and Ukraine’s dependence 
on the United States, the ‘‘favor’’ that 
President Trump sought would have 
been perceived by President Zelensky 
as 
a 
demand. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman worried that the call would 
undermine U.S. national security in-
terests, and he knew immediately that 
he had a duty to report the contents of 
the call to White House lawyers. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
I was concerned by the call. What I heard 
was inappropriate, and I reported my con-
cerns to Mr. Eisenberg. 
It is improper for the President of the 
United States to demand a foreign govern-
ment investigate a U.S. citizen and a polit-
ical opponent. I was also clear that if 
Ukraine pursued an investigation—it was 
also clear that if Ukraine pursued an inves-
tigation into the 2016 elections, the Bidens 
and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a 
partisan play. This would undoubtedly result 
in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, under-
mining U.S. national security, and advanc-
ing Russia’s strategic objectives in the re-
gion. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Recounting 
the content of the call based on his de-
tailed handwritten notes, Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman told the lawyers that 
he believed it was ‘‘wrong’’ for Presi-
dent Trump to ask President Zelensky 
to investigate Vice President Biden. 
Other witnesses were also troubled 
by what they heard. Vice President 
PENCE’s adviser, Jennifer Williams, ex-
pressed concern that President Trump 
raised a ‘‘domestic political matter’’ 
on an official call with a foreign leader. 
She testified that the mention of inves-
tigations struck her as unusual and 
more political in nature. She said: ‘‘I 
guess for me it shed some light on pos-
sible other motives behind a security 
assistance hold.’’ 
Timothy Morrison, a former Repub-
lican congressional staffer who re-
placed Dr. Fiona Hill in July of 2019, 
also reported the call to National Secu-
rity Council lawyers. 
After the call, President Trump con-
tinued to push the scheme forward. 
On July 26, the very next day, Am-
bassador Sondland and Ambassador 
Taylor met with President Zelensky 
and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. 
According to David Holmes, the 
Ukraine-based 
U.S. 
diplomat 
who 
served as the notetaker, the Ukrainian 
leader 
mentioned 
that 
President 
Trump had brought up some ‘‘very sen-
sitive issues’’ during the July 25 call— 
‘‘very sensitive issues.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland then had a pri-
vate meeting with Andriy Yermak, 
President Zelensky’s top aide. The two 
men insisted that the meeting be one- 
on-one with no notetaker—perhaps due 
to the ‘‘very sensitive issues’’ that 
might come up. Ambassador Sondland 
testified 
that 
he 
and 
President 
Zelensky’s aide ‘‘probably’’ discussed 
‘‘the issue of investigations.’’ 
After these key meetings in Ukraine, 
Ambassador Sondland went to lunch 
with David Holmes and two other 
American officials. Mr. Holmes sat di-
rectly 
across 
from 
Ambassador 
Sondland—close enough to hear the de-
tails of an extraordinary telephone call 
between Mr. Sondland and President 
Trump. As Mr. Holmes related during 
his sworn testimony under oath, Am-
bassador Sondland pulled out his unse-
cured cell phone and ‘‘said that he was 
going to call President Trump to give 
him an update.’’ What happened next 
was shocking. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
While Ambassador Sondland’s phone was 
not on speakerphone, I could hear the Presi-
dent’s voice through the earpiece of the 
phone. The President’s voice was loud and 
recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held 
the phone away from his ear for a period of 
time, presumably because of the loud vol-
ume. I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the 
President and explain he was calling from 
Kyiv. I heard President Trump then clarify 
that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. 
Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in 
Ukraine, and went on to state that President 
Zelensky ‘‘loves your ass.’’ 
I then heard President Trump ask, ‘‘So he’s 
going to do the investigation?’’ 
Ambassador Sondland replied that he is 
going to do it, adding that President 
Zelensky will do ‘‘anything you ask him to 
do.’’ 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. ‘‘He is 
going to do it.’’ He will do ‘‘anything 
you ask him to do.’’ 
Immediately after this call with 
President Trump, Mr. Holmes followed 
up with Ambassador Sondland. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
DAVID HOLMES. After the call ended, 
Ambassador Sondland remarked that the 
President was in a bad mood, as Ambassador 
Sondland stated was often the case early in 
the morning. 
I then took the opportunity to ask Ambas-
sador Sondland for his candid impression of 
the President’s views on Ukraine. In par-
ticular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it 
was true that the President did not give a 
[expletive] 
about 
Ukraine. 
Ambassador 
Sondland agreed that the President did not 
give a [expletive] about Ukraine. I asked, 
why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated 
that the President only cares about . . . ‘‘big 
stuff.’’ I noted that there was . . . ‘‘big stuff’’ 
going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. 
Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant 
. . . ‘‘big stuff’’ that benefits the President, 
like the . . . ‘‘Biden investigation’’ that Mr. 
Giuliani was pushing. The conversation then 
moved on to other topics. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. During the 
July 25 call, President Trump asked for 
the favor of these two phony political

investigations immediately after the 
Ukrainian President brought up de-
fense assistance for Ukraine. 
The 
following 
day, 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
confirmed 
to 
President 
Trump that Ukraine would indeed ini-
tiate the investigations discussed on 
the call, which was the only thing the 
President cared about with respect to 
Ukraine. He didn’t care that Russia 
was 
forcefully 
occupying 
eastern 
Ukraine. President Trump didn’t care 
that thousands of Ukrainians appar-
ently have died fighting for their de-
mocracy. He didn’t seem to care that 
supporting Ukraine bolsters America’s 
national security, but he cared about 
himself as it relates to the prospects of 
his reelection in 2020. 
In November, President Trump de-
nied that he spoke to Ambassador 
Sondland on July 26, telling reporters: 
‘‘I know nothing about that.’’ But in 
his 
public 
testimony, 
Ambassador 
Sondland contradicted that assertion 
with official records he obtained from 
the White House. 
Ambassador Sondland further ex-
plained that Holmes’ testimony re-
freshed his recollection about the July 
26 call, which Ambassador Sondland 
had not originally described when he 
first appeared at a deposition before 
the House. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Also, on July 
26th, shortly after our Kyiv meetings, I 
spoke by phone with President Trump. The 
White House, which has finally, finally 
shared certain call dates and times with my 
attorneys confirms this. The call lasted 5 
minutes. 
I remember I was at a restaurant in Kyiv, 
and I have no reason to doubt that this con-
versation included the subject of investiga-
tions. Again, given Mr. Giuliani’s demand 
that President Zelensky make a public state-
ment about investigations, I knew that in-
vestigations were important to President 
Trump. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President 
Trump said that his July 25 conversa-
tion was a perfect call. It was far from 
perfect. 
In a perfect call, the President would 
not demand a political favor from a 
vulnerable Ukraine under attack by a 
Russian foe. In a perfect call, the Presi-
dent would not demand that a foreign 
leader investigate a Russian-inspired 
conspiracy about the 2016 election. In a 
perfect call, the President would not 
pressure a foreign government to tar-
get an American citizen for political, 
personal gain. 
In a perfect call, the President would 
not solicit foreign interference in the 
2020 election. In a perfect call, the 
President would not threaten the well- 
being of a highly respected American 
Ambassador and say she was going to 
‘‘go through some things.’’ In a perfect 
call, the President would not praise a 
disgraced former prosecutor whom the 
free world viewed as corrupt and in-
competent, and in a perfect call, the 
President would not have directed a 
foreign leader to follow up with Ru-
dolph Giuliani, a human hand grenade. 
This was not a perfect call. It is di-
rect evidence that President Donald 
John 
Trump 
corruptly 
abused 
his 
power 
and 
solicited 
foreign 
inter-
ference in the 2020 election. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized.

RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
colleagues, we will now take a 30- 
minute break for dinner and reconvene 
at 5 minutes after 7:00. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate stand in recess until that time. 
There being no objection, at 6:35 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 7:20 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. 
Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, just so Senators have an idea of 
the evening, we expect to go about 2 to 
21⁄2 hours. I will make a presentation. 
Representative LOFGREN
from Cali-
fornia will make a presentation. I will 
make a final presentation, and then we 
will be done for the evening. As an en-
couraging voice told me: Keep it up, 
but don’t keep it up too long. So we 
will do our best not to keep it up too 
long. 
I am going to turn now to the part of 
the chronology that picks up right 
after that July 25 call and walk 
through the increasingly explicit pres-
sure campaign waged on Ukraine in 
order to get President Trump’s deliver-
able—the investigations meant to tar-
nish his opponent and help his reelec-
tion. 
Now remember, by the end of July, 
Ukraine 
was 
aware 
of 
President 
Trump’s requests for investigation to 
help his political efforts and had come 
to know that President Trump put a 
freeze on security assistance. So this is 
by the end of July. They also clearly 
understood that President Trump was 
withholding an Oval Office meeting 
until those investigations were an-
nounced. Both were very critical to 
Ukraine as a sign of U.S. support and 
as a matter of their national security, 
and their national security, of course, 
implicates our national security. 
In the weeks after the July 25 call, 
President Trump’s handpicked rep-
resentatives escalated their efforts to 
get the public announcement of the in-
vestigations from Ukraine. 
So let’s go through this step by step, 
because the 3 weeks following the July 
25 call tell so much about this pressure 
scheme. 
Let’s start with July 26. On July 26— 
so this is the day after the call—Am-
bassador Volker sends a text message 
to Giuliani, and that text message 
says: 
Hi, Mr. Mayor. You may have heard, the 
President had a great call with the Ukrain-
ian President yesterday. Exactly the right 
messages as we discussed. Please send dates 
when you will be in Madrid. I am seeing 
Yermak tomorrow morning. He will come to 
you in Madrid. Thanks for your help. Kurt. 
So here we are the day after that 
call, as my colleague demonstrates— 
this same day, so July 26, and the date 
of that second infamous call between 
President Trump this time and Gordon 
Sondland that you heard the diplomat, 
David Holmes, describe. So that is the 
same day, July 26, that we are talking 
about right now, where there is this 
text message. 
Now, of course, in that July 25 call, 
the President wants to connect Rudy 
Giuliani with the President of Ukraine 
and his people. So this is a followup 
where Ambassador Volker is saying to 
Giuliani: 
[It was] a great call with the Ukraine 
President. Exactly the right messages as we 
discussed. 
And we know, of course, those mes-
sages were the need to do this political 
investigation. 
Please send dates when you will be in Ma-
drid. I am seeing Yermak tomorrow morn-
ing. He will come to you in Madrid. 
So here is Ambassador Volker, one of 
the three amigos, following up, arrang-
ing this meeting between Giuliani and 
the Ukrainians. Giuliani replied, set-
ting a meeting in Europe with Presi-
dent Zelensky’s top aide for the very 
next week: 
‘‘I will arrive on August 1 and until 
5,’’ he wrote. Now remember, on July 
22—so a few days before this and before 
the call—Ambassador Volker had con-
nected 
Giuliani 
originally 
with 
Yermak, and they agreed to meet. So 
this is a followup. You have that ar-
rangement being made by Volker and 
Giuliani before the call. Then, you 
have the call, and now you have the 
followup to arrange the meeting in Ma-
drid. 
So they do meet in Madrid. This is 
August 2. Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s 
top aide, flew to Madrid. He meets with 
Rudy Giuliani, who they know rep-
resented 
the 
President’s 
interests. 
Both Giuliani and Yermak walk away 
from this meeting in Madrid clearly 
understanding that a White House 
meeting is linked to Zelensky’s an-
nouncement of the investigations. 
In 
separate 
conversations 
with 
Giuliani and Yermak after this Madrid 
meeting, Volker said he learned that 
Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to 
issue a statement including specific 
mentions of the two investigations 
that the President wanted. According 
to Ambassador Volker’s testimony, 
Yermak told him that his meeting with 
Giuliani was very good and imme-
diately added that the Ukrainians 
asked for a White House meeting dur-
ing the week of December 16. 
Yermak presses Volker on the White 
House meeting date, saying that he 
was waiting for confirmation: ‘‘Maybe 
you know the date.’’ This is a recurrent 
theme that we have seen through the 
text messages and other documents, 
and that is the recurrent requests for

this meeting, the pressing for this 
meeting by the Ukrainians because it 
was so important to them. Giuliani’s 
objective was clear to Ambassadors 
Volker and Sondland, who took over 
the communications with Yermak. 
Here is Ambassador Sondland. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SONDLAND. I first communicated 
with Mr. Giuliani in early August, several 
months later. Mr. Giuliani emphasized that 
the President wanted a public statement 
from 
President 
Zelensky 
committing 
Ukraine to look into the corruption issues. 
Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 
election, including the DNC server, and 
Burisma as two topics of importance to the 
President. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Giuliani ex-
erted significant influence in this proc-
ess. In fact, when on August 4 Yermak 
inquired again about the Presidential 
meeting, Ambassador Volker turned 
not to the National Security Council 
staff or to the State Department to ar-
range it and follow up. He turned to 
Giuliani again. Volker told Yermak 
that he would speak with Giuliani later 
that day and would call the Ukrainian 
President’s aide afterward. 
Volker then texts Giuliani to ask 
about the Madrid meeting and to set up 
the call that he had mentioned to 
Yermak. Giuliani replies that the 
meeting with Yermak was excellent 
and that he would call later. Phone 
records obtained by the committees 
show a 16-minute call on August 5 be-
tween 
Ambassador 
Volker 
and 
Giuliani. 
Ambassador 
Volker 
then 
texts Yermak: 
Hi, Andriy. Had a good, long talk with 
Rudy. Call anytime. Kurt. 
Separately, Volker told Ambassador 
Sondland: ‘‘Giuliani was happy with 
that meeting and it looks like things 
are turning around’’—a reference to 
Volker’s hope that satisfying Giuliani 
would break down President Trump’s 
reservations concerning Ukraine. 
But things had not turned around by 
the end of that first week of August, by 
August 7. The aid was still on hold, and 
there had been no movement on setting 
a date for the White House meeting. 
Ambassador Volker then reaches out 
to Giuliani to try to get things moving. 
Ambassador Volker texts Giuliani to 
recommend that he report to ‘‘the 
boss,’’ 
meaning 
President 
Trump, 
about his meeting with Yermak in Ma-
drid. Specifically, he wrote—this is 
Volker writing to Giuliani: 
Hi, Rudy. Hope you made it back safely. 
Let’s meet if you are coming to DC. It would 
be good if you could convey results of your 
meeting in Madrid to the boss so we can get 
a firm date for the visit. 
So this is Ambassador Volker fol-
lowing up with Giuliani. Giuliani has 
met with the top aide to the President 
of 
Ukraine 
in 
Madrid. 
He 
wants 
Giuliani to convey to the boss—to 
Trump—how good that meeting in Ma-
drid was about the investigations so 
they can get the President of Ukraine 
in the door at the White House. 
Now, think about how unusual this 
is. This is the President’s personal law-
yer, who is on this personal mission on 
behalf of his client to get these inves-
tigations in Ukraine. The President of 
Ukraine can’t get in the door of the 
Oval Office. And who are they going to? 
Are they going to the Security Coun-
cil? No. Are they going to the State 
Department? No. They tried all that. 
They are going to the President’s per-
sonal lawyer. Does that sound like an 
official policy to try to fight corrup-
tion? 
Why would you go outside of the nor-
mal channel to do that? You wouldn’t. 
You would go to your personal attor-
ney, who is on a personal mission that 
he admits is not foreign policy, when 
your objective has nothing to do with 
policy, when your objective is a cor-
rupt one. 
What does that mean, to have a cor-
rupt objective? It means an illicit one. 
It means an impermissible one. It 
means one that furthers your own in-
terests at the cost of the national in-
terests—the willingness to break the 
law, like the Impoundment Control 
Act, by withholding aid is indicative of 
that corrupt purpose, the lengths the 
President would go, not in furtherance 
of U.S. policy but against U.S. policy, 
not even a difference on policy at all. 
The mere pursuit of personal inter-
est, the pursuit of an illegal effort to 
get foreign interference, is the very 
embodiment of a corrupt intent. 
Here we are, August 7. Volker is say-
ing: Rudy, if you are coming to DC, 
let’s get together. It would be good if 
you can talk to the boss because we 
can’t get a meeting another way. 
Around 
that 
time, 
Ambassador 
Volker received a text message from 
Yermak, who asked him—and this is 
Yermak asking Volker: 
Hi Kurt. How are you? Do you have some 
news about White House meeting date? 
Volker responds: 
Not yet—I texted Rudy earlier to make 
sure he weighs in following your meeting. 
Gordon— 
Meaning Sondland. 
should be speaking with the president on 
Friday. We are pressing this. 
There is Gordon Sondland, who is 
‘‘pressing this.’’ This is the man you 
have 
heard 
from 
already—Gordon 
Sondland, the man who says: It was ab-
solutely a quid pro quo. You have 
asked about a quid pro quo. There was 
a quid pro quo about this White House 
meeting. 
This is what they are talking about 
right here. Gordon will be ‘‘speaking 
with the president on Friday. We are 
pressing this.’’ 
Ambassador Volker’s contact with 
Giuliani spurred a flurry of commu-
nications. The patterns of calls from 
August 8 strongly suggest Giuliani was 
attempting to call the White House to 
speak to a senior White House official, 
left a message, then had a 4-minute 
call with that official later that night. 
We don’t know from the call records 
who that White House official was, but 
recall that Giuliani has publicly stated 
that when he spoke to the White 
House, he usually spoke to President 
Trump, his client. 
Also, on August 8, Yermak texts 
Volker that he had some news. Ambas-
sador Volker replies that he can talk 
then, and Ambassador Volker updates 
Giuliani in a text the next day. 
Volker says to Giuliani in the text: 
Hi Mr. Mayor! Had a good chat with 
Yermak last night. He was pleased with your 
phone call. Mentioned— 
He is referring to President Zelensky 
here. 
making a statement. Can we all get on the 
phone to make sure I advise— 
Here he is referring to President 
Zelensky. 
correctly as to what he should be saying? 
Want to make sure we get this done right. 
Here, August 9, there is an effort by 
Volker to make sure to get this state-
ment right about the investigations. If 
they can’t get the statement right, you 
aren’t going to get in the door of the 
Oval Office. 
It also makes clear who is exactly in 
charge of this, and that is Rudy 
Giuliani. Ambassador Volker is check-
ing with Rudy Giuliani about what he 
should advise President Zelensky. We 
know that Giuliani is taking his orders 
from President Trump. 
Text messages and call records ob-
tained by the committees show that 
Ambassador Volker and Giuliani con-
nected by phone twice around noon on 
August 9 for several minutes each. 
Following the calls with Giuliani, 
Ambassador Volker created a three- 
way group chat using WhatsApp and 
included 
himself, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, and Yermak. Ambassador 
Volker initiated the chat a round 2:20 
that day. This is Volker chatting with 
Sondland and Yermak. It is a three- 
way chat. 
Volker says: 
Hi, Andrey— 
Meaning Yermak. 
We have all consulted here, including with 
Rudy. Can you do a call later today or to-
morrow your afternoon time? 
Sondland says: 
I have a call [scheduled] at 3 pm Eastern 
for the three of us. Ops will call. 
Call records obtained by the commit-
tees show that on August 9 Ambassador 
Sondland twice connected with phone 
lines 
associated 
with 
the 
White 
House—once in the early afternoon for 
about 18 minutes and once in the late 
afternoon for about 2 minutes. We 
know that Ambassador Sondland had 
direct access to President Trump. 
After all this activity, Ambassador 
Sondland and Volker thought they had 
a 
breakthrough—finally, 
a 
break-
through. Minutes after this call, which 
was likely with Tim Morrison about a 
possible date for the White House 
meeting, 
Ambassador 
Volker 
and 
Sondland discussed the agreement they 
believed they had reached and started 
with Sondland in this text message: 
Morrison ready to get dates as soon as 
Yermak confirms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S473 
January 22, 2020 
Volker says: 
Excellent!! How did you sway him? 
Sondland says: 
Not sure I did. I think potus really wants 
the deliverable. 
We know what that ‘‘deliverable’’ is. 
It is the political investigations. 
Volker says: 
But does he know that? 
And Sondland says: 
Yep. Clearly lots of convos— 
Meaning conversations. 
going on. 
Volker says: 
OK—then that’s good it’s coming from two 
separate sources. 
Ambassador Sondland told the com-
mittees that the deliverable required 
by President Trump was a press state-
ment from President Zelensky commit-
ting to do the investigations into the 
Bidens and the allegation of Ukraine 
election interference that President 
Trump mentioned on July 25. But Tim 
Morrison testified that he didn’t know 
anything about the deliverable; he was 
just involved in trying to schedule the 
White House meeting, which everyone 
wanted to schedule as a sign of support 
for President Zelensky and our ally 
Ukraine. But Trump’s agents wouldn’t 
just accept Ukraine’s word for it. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
then 
rec-
ommended to Ambassador Volker that 
Yermak share a draft of the press 
statement to ensure that the state-
ment would comport with the Presi-
dent’s expectations. 
Here, on August 9—we are still less 
than 2 weeks after the July 25 call; I 
guess we are about 2 weeks—Sondland 
says in this message: 
To avoid misunderstandings, might be 
helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement 
(embargoed) so that we can see exactly what 
they propose to cover. Even though Ze— 
Referring to Zelensky. 
does a [live] presser they can still summarize 
in a brief statement. Thoughts? 
And Volker says: 
Agree! 
At 
his 
deposition, 
Ambassador 
Sondland said that he suggested re-
viewing a written summary of the 
statement because he was concerned 
that President Zelensky would say 
whatever he would say on live tele-
vision, and it still wouldn’t be good 
enough for Rudy/the President. 
Yermak, in turn, was concerned that 
the announcement would still not re-
sult in the coveted White House meet-
ing. On August 10, Yermak texted 
Volker, attempting to schedule a White 
House meeting before the Ukrainian 
President made a public statement in 
support of the investigations into 
Burisma and the 2016 election. 
You can see what is going on here. 
The President and his agent, Giuliani, 
want this public statement of the in-
vestigations before they will give a 
date. And the Ukrainians want a date 
before they have to commit to making 
public they are going to do the inves-
tigations. 
So you have had this standoff where 
each is trying to get the deliverable 
first, but there is no debate about what 
the deliverable is on either side. There 
is no debate about the quid pro quo 
here: You give me this; I will give you 
that. You give me the White House 
meeting; I will give you the public an-
nouncement of the investigation into 
your political rival. 
No, no, no. You give me the an-
nouncement of the investigation into 
my rival, and then I will give you the 
meeting. 
The only debate here is about which 
comes first. 
August 10, Yermak texts Volker: 
I think it’s possible to make this declara-
tion and mention all these things. Which we 
discussed yesterday. But it will be logic to 
do after we receive a confirmation of date. 
We inform about date of visit about our ex-
pectations and our guarantees for future 
visit. Let discuss it. 
Ambassador Volker responded that 
he agreed but that first they would 
have to iron out a statement and use 
that to get a date, after which Presi-
dent Zelensky would give the state-
ment. The two decided to have a call 
the next day and to include Ambas-
sador Sondland. 
Yermak texts Ambassador Volker: 
Excellent. 
Once we have a date, will call for a press 
briefing, announcing upcoming visit and out-
lining vision for the reboot of the US- 
UKRAINE relationship, including, among 
other things, Burisma and election meddling 
in investigations. 
Yermak was also in direct contact 
with Ambassador Sondland regarding 
this revised approach. In fact, he sent 
Ambassador Sondland the same text 
message. 
Ambassador Sondland kept the lead-
ership of the State Department in the 
loop. On August 10, he told Ambassador 
Volker that he had reported to T. 
Ulrich Breckbull, Counselor of the De-
partment of State, who, Sondland tes-
tified, frequently consulted with Sec-
retary Pompeo. 
Sondland wrote to Volker: I briefed 
Ulrich. All good. So Ulrich is in the 
loop. 
Sondland and Volker continued to 
pursue the statement from Zelensky on 
the investigations. The next day, Am-
bassador Sondland emails Breckbull 
and Lisa Kenna, the State Depart-
ment’s Executive Secretary, about ef-
forts to secure a public statement and 
a big presser from President Zelensky. 
Sondland hoped it might ‘‘make the 
boss happy enough to authorize an in-
vitation.’’ 
After first being evasive on the topic, 
Secretary Pompeo has subsequently ac-
knowledged that he listened in on the 
July 25 call. 
Since he was on the call, Pompeo 
must have understood what would 
make the boss—that is, the President— 
happy enough to schedule a White 
House meeting. 
Again, everyone was in the loop. On 
August 11, Ambassador Volker sent 
Giuliani a text message. This is Volker 
to Giuliani: 
Hi Rudy—we have heard bCk [sic] from 
Andrey again—they are writing the state-
ment now and will send it to us. Can you 
talk for 5 min before noon today? 
And Giuliani says: 
Yes just call. 
That is August 11. 
On the next day, August 12, Yermak 
sent Ambassador Volker an initial 
version of the draft statement by text. 
Notably, as we saw earlier, this state-
ment from the Ukrainians doesn’t ex-
plicitly mention Burisma, Biden, or 
2016—election investigations that the 
President has been seeking. 
You can see what is going on here 
now. There was this game of chicken. 
You go first. 
No, we’ll go first. You give us the 
date, and we will give you the state-
ment. 
No, you give us the statement, and 
we will give you the date. 
And now, realizing, OK, they have to 
give the statement first, Ukraine tries 
to give them a generic statement that 
doesn’t really go into specifics about 
these investigations. And why? You 
can imagine why. Ukrainians don’t 
want to have to go out in public and 
say they are going to do these inves-
tigations, because they are not stupid, 
because they understood this would 
pull them right into U.S. Presidential 
politics. It was intended to, which isn’t 
in Ukraine’s interests. It is not in our 
interests either, and Ukraine under-
stood that. And so they resisted. 
First they resisted having to do the 
public statement, and then they want-
ed to make sure they got the deliver-
able, and then, when they had to make 
the statement, they didn’t want to be 
specific—for one thing, for another 
thing. This was what Zelensky cam-
paigned on. He was going to fight cor-
ruption. He was going to end political 
investigations, so he didn’t want to be 
specific. 
He sends this statement that doesn’t 
have the specific references. Ambas-
sador Volker explained during his tes-
timony that was not what Giuliani was 
requesting, and it would not satisfy 
Giuliani or Donald Trump. 
Presumably, if the President was in-
terested in corruption, that statement 
would have been enough. But all he was 
interested in was an investigation or 
an announcement of an investigation 
into his rival and this debunked theory 
about 2016. 
The conversation that Volker re-
ferred to in his earlier testimony took 
place on the morning of August 13, 
when Giuliani made clear that the spe-
cific 
investigations 
related 
to 
Burisma—code for Bidens—and the 2016 
election had to be included in order to 
get the White House meeting. 
The Americans sent back to the 
Ukrainian top aide a revised draft that 
includes now the two investigations. 
You have seen the side-by-side. This 
was then the essence of the quid pro 
quo regarding the meeting. This direc-
tion came from President Trump. Here 
is how Ambassador Sondland put it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S474 
January 22, 2020 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani’s 
requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a 
White House visit for President Zelensky. 
Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a 
public statement announcing the investiga-
tions of the 2016 election DNC server and 
Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the de-
sires of the President of the United States, 
and we knew these investigations were im-
portant to the President. 
According to witness testimony, as 
you might imagine, Ukrainian officials 
were very uncomfortable with a draft 
that Giuliani, Volker, and Sondland 
were 
negotiating. 
They 
understood 
that the statement was the deliverable 
that President Trump wanted, but 
yielding to President Trump’s demands 
would, in essence, force President 
Zelensky to break his promise to the 
Ukrainian people to root out corrup-
tion because politically motivated in-
vestigations are the hallmark of the 
kind of corruption that Ukraine has 
been plagued with in the past. 
Mr. Yermak tried to get some con-
firmation that the requested investiga-
tions were legitimate. Yermak asked 
Volker ‘‘whether any request had ever 
been made by the U.S. to investigate 
election interference in 2016’’; in other 
words, whether any request had been 
made by any official U.S. law enforce-
ment agency through formal channels 
as you would expect if it were a legiti-
mate request. 
Ambassador Volker, trying to find a 
satisfactory answer, on August 15, 
Volker’s assistant asked Deputy As-
sistant Secretary George Kent whether 
there was any precedent for such a re-
quest for investigations. At his deposi-
tion, Kent testified that ‘‘if you’re ask-
ing me, have we ever gone to the 
Ukrainians and asked them to inves-
tigate or prosecute individuals for po-
litical reasons, the answer is, I hope we 
haven’t, and we shouldn’t because that 
goes against everything that we are 
trying to promote in the post Soviet 
states for the last 28 years, which is 
promotion of the rule of law.’’ 
We are now on the next day, August 
16. In a conversation with Ambassador 
Bill Taylor, the U.S. Ambassador in 
Kyiv—Ambassador Taylor stepped in 
when Ambassador Yovanovitch was 
pushed 
out—Taylor 
‘‘amplified 
the 
same theme’’ and told Kent that 
‘‘Yermak 
was 
very 
uncomfortable’’ 
with the idea of investigations and sug-
gested it should be done officially and 
put in writing. 
As a result, it became clear to Kent 
in mid-August that Ukraine was being 
pressured to conduct politically moti-
vated investigations. Kent told Ambas-
sador Taylor: ‘‘That’s wrong, and we 
shouldn’t be doing that as a matter of 
U.S. policy.’’ 
Ambassador Volker claimed that he 
stopped pursuing the statement from 
the Iranians around this time because 
of the concerns raised by Zelensky’s 
aide. At his deposition and despite all 
his efforts to secure a statement an-
nouncing these very specific political 
investigations desired by the Presi-
dent, Ambassador Volker testified that 
he agreed with Yermak’s concerns and 
advised him that making those specific 
references was not a good idea because 
making those statements might look 
like it would play into our domestic 
politics. 
Without specific references to the po-
litically damaging investigations that 
Trump demanded, the agreement just 
wouldn’t work. Ukraine did not release 
the statement and, in turn, the White 
House meeting was not scheduled. As it 
turns out, Ambassadors Sondland and 
Volker did not achieve the break-
through after all. 
Let’s go into what finally breaks the 
logjam because that involves the mili-
tary aid. With efforts to trade a White 
House meeting for a press statement 
announcing the investigations tempo-
rarily scuttled, Sondland and Volker 
go back to the drawing board. On Au-
gust 19, Ambassador Sondland told 
Volker that he drove the larger issue 
home 
with 
Yermak, 
President 
Zelensky’s top aide, particularly that 
this was now bigger than a White 
House meeting—bigger than just the 
White House meeting and was about 
the relationship per se. It is not just 
about the meeting anymore; it is about 
everything. 
By this time in late August, the hold 
on security assistance had been in 
place more than a month, and there 
was still no credible explanation of-
fered by the White House despite some, 
like Ambassador Sondland, repeatedly 
asking. There were no interagency 
meetings since July 31, and the Defense 
Department had withdrawn its assur-
ances that it could even comply with 
the law, which, indeed, it couldn’t. 
Every agency in the administration op-
posed the hold. As the Government Ac-
countability 
Office 
confirmed, 
con-
cerned DOD and OMB officials had been 
right that the President’s holding of 
the aid was an unlawful act, but Presi-
dent Trump was not budging. 
At the same time, despite the per-
sistent efforts of numerous people, 
President Trump refused to schedule 
the coveted White House visit with 
President Zelensky until the investiga-
tions were announced that would ben-
efit his campaign. 
Here is what Ambassador Sondland 
said about the hold on funds and its 
link to the politically motivated inves-
tigations in Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. In the absence of 
any credible explanation for the suspension 
of aid, I later came to believe that the re-
sumption of security aid would not occur 
until there was a public statement from 
Ukraine committing to the investigations of 
the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. 
Giuliani had demanded. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. From the Em-
bassy in Kyiv, David Holmes reached 
the same conclusion—a conclusion as 
simple as two plus two equals four. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GORDON. Mr. Holmes, you have testified 
that by late August, you had a clear impres-
sion that the security assistance hold was 
somehow connected to the investigations 
that President Trump wanted. How did you 
conclude—how did you make—reach that 
clear conclusion? 
Ambassador HOLMES. Sir, we’ve been 
hearing 
about 
the 
investigation 
since 
March—months 
before—and 
President 
Zelensky had received a congratulatory let-
ter from the president saying he would be 
pleased to meet him following his inaugura-
tion in May. 
And we had been unable to get that meet-
ing. And then the security hold came up with 
no explanation. 
And I’d be surprised if any of the Ukrain-
ians—we discussed earlier, you know, they’re 
sophisticated people—when they received no 
explanation for why that hold was in place, 
they would have drawn that conclusion. 
GORDON. Because the investigations were 
still being pursued? 
Ambassador HOLMES. Right. 
GORDON. And the hold was still remaining 
without explanation? 
Ambassador HOLMES. Right. 
GORDON. So this to you was the only log-
ical conclusion that you could reach? 
Ambassador HOLMES. Right. 
GORDON. Sort of like 2 plus 2 equals 4? 
Ambassador HOLMES. Exactly. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland ex-
plained the predicament he believed he 
faced with a hold on aid to Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. As my other 
State Department colleagues have testified, 
this security aid was critical to Ukraine’s 
defense and should not have been delayed. I 
expressed this view to many during this pe-
riod, but my goal at the time was to do what 
was necessary to get the aid released, to 
break the logjam. I believed that the public 
statement we have been discussing for weeks 
was essential to advancing that goal. 
You know, I really regret that the Ukrain-
ians were placed in that predicament, but I 
do not regret doing what I could to try to 
break the logjam and to solve the problem. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. On August 22, 
Ambassador Sondland tried to break 
that logjam, as he put it, regarding 
both the security assistance hold and 
the White House meeting. Ambassador 
Sondland described those efforts in his 
public testimony. Let’s listen to him 
again. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. In preparation 
for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked 
Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-face 
conversation between Trump and Zelensky 
would help to break the logjam. This was 
when President Trump was still intending 
the travel to Warsaw. 
Specifically, on August 22nd, I emailed 
Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secre-
tariat Kenna. I wrote—and this is my email 
to Secretary Pompeo. Should we block time 
in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for POTUS 
to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to 
look him in the eye and tell him that once 
Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place in 
mid-September, 
that 
Zelensky—he, 
Zelensky, should be able to move forward 
publicly and with confidence on those issues 
of importance to POTUS in the U.S. Hope-
fully, that will help break the logjam. 
The secretary replied, yes. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland also 
explained that both he and Secretary 
Pompeo understood that issues of im-
portance to the President were the two

sham 
investigations 
the 
President 
wanted to help his reelection efforts. 
And that reference to the logjam 
meant both the security assistance and 
the White House meeting. 
At the end of August, National Secu-
rity Advisor John Bolton arrived in 
Ukraine for an official visit. David 
Holmes took notes in Bolton’s meeting 
and 
testified 
about 
Ambassador 
Bolton’s message to the Ukrainians. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador HOLMES. Shortly thereafter, 
on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton visits 
Ukraine and brought welcome news that 
President Trump had agreed to meet Presi-
dent Zelensky on September 1st in Warsaw. 
Ambassador Bolton further indicated that 
the hold on security assistance would not be 
lifted prior to the Warsaw meeting, where it 
would hang on whether President Zelensky 
was able to ‘‘favorably impress President 
Trump.’’ 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let’s think 
about that for a minute—unless you 
have something further to say. Let’s 
think about that for a minute. Bolton 
further indicated that the hold on secu-
rity assistance would not be lifted 
prior to the Warsaw meeting where it 
would 
hang 
on 
whether 
President 
Zelensky was able to ‘‘favorably im-
press’’ President Trump. 
What do you think would favorably 
impress President Trump? What were 
the only two things that President 
Trump asked of President Zelensky? 
What were the two things that Rudy 
Giuliani 
was 
asking 
of 
President 
Zelensky and his top aides? What 
would 
favorably 
impress 
Donald 
Trump? 
Would Donald Trump be favorably 
impressed if President Zelensky were 
to tell him about this new corruption 
court or new legislation in Marada or 
how negotiations with the Russians 
were going or how they are bringing 
about defense reform? 
Had any of those things ever come up 
in any of these text messages, any of 
these emails, any of these phone calls, 
any of these conversations? Of course 
not. Of course not. There was only one 
thing that was going to favorably im-
press President Trump in Warsaw, and 
that is if Zelensky told him to his face: 
I am going to do these political inves-
tigations. I don’t want to do them. You 
know I don’t want to do them. I re-
sisted doing them, but I am at war 
with Russia, and I can’t wait anymore. 
I can’t wait anymore. I am sure that 
would have impressed Donald Trump. 
But the meeting between the two 
Presidents never happened in Warsaw. 
President Trump canceled the trip at 
the last moment. Before Bolton left 
Kyiv, Ambassador Taylor asked for a 
private meeting. Ambassador Taylor 
explained that he was extremely con-
cerned about the hold on security as-
sistance. He described the meeting to 
us during his testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Am-
bassador Bolton’s visit, I asked to meet him 
privately, during which I expressed my seri-
ous concern about the withholding of mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrain-
ians were defending their country from Rus-
sian aggression. Ambassador Bolton rec-
ommended that I send the first-person cable 
to Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my 
concerns. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Now, in the 
State Department, sending a first-per-
son cable is an extraordinary step. 
State Department cables are ordinarily 
written in the third person, as Ambas-
sador Taylor testified at his deposition. 
Sending a first-person cable gets atten-
tion because there are not many first- 
person cables that come in. In fact, in 
his decades of diplomatic service, he 
had never written a single one until 
now. 
Taylor sent that cable on August 29. 
Would you like me to read that to you 
right now? I would like to read it to 
you right now, except I don’t have it 
because 
the 
State 
Department 
wouldn’t provide it, but if you would 
like me to read it to you, we can do 
something about that. We can insist on 
getting that from the State Depart-
ment. If you would like to know what 
John Bolton had in mind when he 
thought that Zelensky could favorably 
impress the President in Warsaw, we 
can find that out, too, just for the ask-
ing in a document called a subpoena. 
Taylor sends that cable on August 29. 
The State Department did not provide 
that cable to us in response to a sub-
poena, but witnesses who reviewed it 
described it as a powerful message that 
described the folly—the folly—of with-
holding military aid from Ukraine at a 
time when it was facing incursion from 
Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. 
That cable also sought to explain that 
U.S. assistance to Ukraine was vital to 
U.S. national security as well. 
Now, why don’t they want you to see 
that cable? Maybe they don’t want you 
to see that cable because that cable 
from a Vietnam veteran describes just 
how essential that military assistance 
was not just to Ukraine; maybe they 
don’t want you to see that cable be-
cause it describes just how important 
that military assistance is to us—to us. 
The President’s counsel would love 
you to believe that this is just about 
Ukraine. You don’t need to care about 
Ukraine. Who cares about Ukraine? 
How many people can find Ukraine on 
a map? Why should we care about 
Ukraine? Well, we should care about 
Ukraine. They are an ally of ours. If it 
matters to us, we should care about the 
fact that, in 1994, we asked them to 
give up their nuclear weapons that 
they had inherited from the Soviet 
Union, and they didn’t want to give 
them up, and we were worried about 
proliferation. 
We said: Hey, if you give them up, 
which you don’t want to do because 
you are worried the Russians might in-
vade if you give them up, we will help 
assure your territorial integrity. 
We made that commitment. I hope 
we care about that. I hope we care 
about that because they did give them 
up. 
And do you know what? Just what 
they feared took place—the Russians 
moved across their border, and they re-
main an occupied party in Ukraine. 
That is the word of America we gave, 
and we are breaking that word. Why? 
For help on a political campaign? 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
was 
exactly 
right. That is crazy. It is worse than 
crazy. It is repulsive. It is repugnant. 
It breaks our word. To do it in the 
name of these corrupt investigations is 
also contrary to everything we espouse 
around the world. 
I used to be part of a commission in 
the House on democracy assistance, 
where we would meet with parliamen-
tarians, and I know my Senate col-
leagues do much the same thing. We 
would urge our colleagues to observe 
the rule of law, not to engage in polit-
ical investigations and prosecutions. I 
don’t know how we make that argu-
ment now. I don’t know how we look 
our allies or these burgeoning democ-
racies in the face or our fellow parlia-
mentarians and make that argument 
now. I wouldn’t make that argument 
now. 
Testimony indicated that Secretary 
Pompeo eventually carried that cable 
into the White House, but there is no 
evidence that those national security 
concerns that they don’t want you to 
see were able to outweigh the Presi-
dent’s personal interest in his getting 
foreign help in his reelection cam-
paign. There is no evidence at all. 
Now we get to August 28. 
POLITICO was the first to publicly 
report that President Trump had im-
plemented a hold on nearly $400 million 
of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine 
that had been appropriated by Con-
gress. Now that the worst kept secret 
was public, Ukrainian officials imme-
diately expressed their alarm and con-
cern to their American counterparts. 
As witnesses explained, the Ukrain-
ians had two serious concerns. 
One, of course, was the aid itself, 
which was vital to their ability to fight 
off Russia. In addition, they were wor-
ried about the symbolism of the hold; 
that it signaled to Russia and Vladimir 
Putin that the United States was wa-
vering in its support for Ukraine. Wit-
nesses testified that this was a division 
that Russia could and would exploit to 
drive a further wedge between the 
United States and Ukraine to its ad-
vantage. 
The second concern was likely why 
Ukrainian officials had wanted the 
hold to remain a secret in the first 
place—because it would add to the neg-
ative impact to Ukraine if the hold 
itself became public. It is bad enough 
that the President of the United States 
put a hold on their aid. It was going to 
be far worse if it became public as, in-
deed, it did. 
Andriy Yermak, the same Zelensky 
aide, sent Ambassador Volker a link to 
the POLITICO story and then texted: 
‘‘Need to talk with you.’’ 
Other Ukrainian officials also ex-
pressed concerns to Ambassador Volker

that the Ukrainian Government was 
being singled out and penalized for 
some reason. 
Well, what do we think that reason 
was? Why were they being singled out? 
Why was that country being singled 
out? That was the one country that 
this President could lever for help 
against an opponent he feared. That is 
why Ukraine was being singled out. 
On August 29, Yermak also contacted 
Ambassador Taylor. Yermak said the 
Ukrainians were very concerned about 
the hold on military assistance. He 
said that he and other Ukrainian offi-
cials would be willing to travel to 
Washington to explain to its officials 
the importance of this assistance. 
Ambassador Taylor, who was on the 
ground 
in 
Ukraine, 
explained 
the 
Ukrainian 
viewpoint 
and, 
frankly, 
their desperation. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. In September, the 
Minister of Defense, for example, came to 
me—I would use the word—‘‘desperate’’ to 
figure out why the assistance was being held. 
He thought that perhaps, if he went to Wash-
ington to talk to you—to talk to the Sec-
retary of Defense, to talk to the President— 
he would be able to find out and reassure— 
provide whatever answer was necessary to 
have that assistance released. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Without any 
official explanation for the hold, Amer-
ican officials could provide little reas-
surance to their Ukrainian counter-
parts. It has been publicly reported 
that 
President 
Trump, 
Secretary 
Esper, and Secretary Pompeo met in 
late August and that they all implored 
the President to release the aid, but 
President Trump continued to refuse to 
release the aid. 
As of August 30, the President was 
clearly directing the OMB to continue 
the hold on security assistance. In doc-
uments reviewed by just security but 
withheld from the Congress by the 
OMB on the President’s instructions, 
OMB official Michael Duffey emailed 
DOD 
Comptroller 
Elaine 
McCusker 
that there is ‘‘clear direction from 
POTUS to continue the hold.’’ 
So here we are on August 30. A 
month after that July 25 call, aid is 
still being withheld. Ukrainians are 
still holding on, still not willing to ca-
pitulate, 
not 
willing 
to 
violate 
Zelensky’s 
whole 
campaign 
pledge 
about not engaging in corrupt inves-
tigations. 
On that same day, August 30, Repub-
lican Senator RON JOHNSON spoke with 
Ambassador Sondland to express his 
concern about President Trump’s deci-
sion to withhold military assistance to 
Ukraine. Senator JOHNSON
described 
that call in an interview with the Wall 
Street Journal. 
According to Senator JOHNSON, Am-
bassador Sondland told him that if 
Ukraine would commit to ‘‘get to the 
bottom of what happened in 2016—if 
President Trump has that confidence— 
then he will release the military spend-
ing.’’ 
Senator JOHNSON added: 
At that suggestion, I winced. My reaction 
was, ‘‘Oh, God. I don’t want to see those two 
things combined.’’ 
The next day, August 31, Senator 
JOHNSON spoke by phone with Presi-
dent Trump regarding the decision to 
withhold aid to Ukraine. According to 
the Wall Street Journal, President 
Trump denied the quid pro quo that 
Senator JOHNSON had learned of from 
Ambassador Sondland. At the same 
time, however, President Trump re-
fused to authorize Senator JOHNSON to 
tell Ukrainian officials on his upcom-
ing trip to Kyiv that the aid would be 
forthcoming. 
The 
message 
that 
Ambassador 
Sondland communicated to Senator 
JOHNSON mirrored that used by Presi-
dent Trump during the July 25 call 
with President Zelensky in which 
President 
Trump 
twice 
asked 
the 
Ukrainian leader to get to the bottom 
of it, including in connection to an in-
vestigation into the debunked con-
spiracy theory of Ukrainian inter-
ference in the 2016 election. It also mir-
rored the language of the text message 
that Ambassador Volker sent to Presi-
dent Zelensky’s aide just before the 
July 25 call. 
Indeed, despite the President’s self- 
serving denials, the message was clear: 
President Trump wanted the investiga-
tions, and he would withhold not one 
but two acts vested in him by the 
power of his office in order to get them. 
Now begins September, September 1. 
The President was supposed to go to 
Warsaw, as we know, but he does not 
go to Warsaw. MIKE PENCE goes to War-
saw. Jennifer Williams, the special ad-
viser to the Vice President for Europe 
and Russia, learned of the change in 
the President’s travel plans on August 
29. The Vice President’s National Secu-
rity Advisor asked, at the request of 
Vice President PENCE, for an update on 
the status of the security assistance 
that had just been publicly revealed in 
POLITICO and would be a critical issue 
during the bilateral meeting between 
the 
Vice 
President 
and 
President 
Zelensky in Warsaw. 
The delegation arrived in Warsaw 
and gathered in a hotel room to brief 
Vice President PENCE before he met 
with the Ukrainian President. National 
Security Advisor Bolton led the meet-
ing. 
As Williams described it, advisers in 
the room ‘‘agreed on the need to get a 
final decision on security assistance as 
soon as possible so that it could be im-
plemented before the end of the year, 
but Vice President PENCE did not have 
authority from the President to release 
the aid.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland also attended 
that briefing. At the end of it, he ex-
pressed concern directly to Vice Presi-
dent PENCE about the security assist-
ance being held until the Ukrainians 
announced the very same politically 
motivated investigations at the heart 
of this scheme. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Chairman SCHIFF. You mentioned that 
you also had a conversation with Vice Presi-
dent Pence before his meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky in Warsaw and that you raised 
a concern you had, as well, that the security 
assistance was being withheld because of the 
President’s desire to get a commitment from 
Zelensky to pursue these political investiga-
tions. What did you say to the Vice Presi-
dent? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I was in a brief-
ing with several people, and I just spoke up, 
and I said: It appears that everything is 
stalled until this statement gets made. It 
was something—words to that effect. That’s 
what I believe to be the case based on, you 
know, the work that the three of us had been 
doing—Volker, Perry, and myself—and the 
Vice President nodded like, you know, he 
heard what I said, and that was pretty much 
it as I recall. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Everyone was 
in the loop. Ambassador Sondland tes-
tified that Vice President PENCE was 
neither surprised nor dismayed by the 
description of this quid pro quo. 
At the beginning of the bilateral 
meeting between President Zelensky 
and Vice President PENCE, as expected, 
the 
first 
question 
from 
President 
Zelensky related to the status of the 
security assistance. 
As Vice President PENCE’s aide Jen-
nifer 
Williams 
testified, 
President 
Zelensky explained that just equally 
with the financial and fiscal value of 
the assistance, that it was the sym-
bolic nature of that assistance that 
really was the show of U.S. support for 
Ukraine and for Ukraine’s sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. 
Later that day, Vice President PENCE 
spoke to the President about his meet-
ing with President Zelensky, but the 
hold on security assistance remained in 
place well after Vice President PENCE 
returned from Warsaw. 
After the Warsaw meeting with Vice 
President 
PENCE, 
Ambassador 
Sondland quickly pulled aside Andriy 
Yermak, Zelensky’s top aide, and in-
formed him that the aid would not be 
forthcoming until Ukraine publicly an-
nounced the two investigations that 
President Trump wanted. 
So here we are, after the meeting— 
right after the meeting. They are still 
in Warsaw, and Zelensky pulls aside his 
Ukrainian counterpart, Yermak, and 
explains the aid is not coming until the 
investigations are announced. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Based on my pre-
vious 
communication 
with 
Secretary 
Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my con-
cerns with Mr. Yermak. It was a very, very 
brief, pulled aside conversation that hap-
pened within a few seconds. I told Mr. 
Yermak that I believed that the resumption 
of U.S. aid would likely not occur until 
Ukraine took some kind of action on the 
public statement that we have been dis-
cussing for many weeks. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let’s let that 
sink in for a minute too. 
You have heard my colleagues at the 
other table say: Ukrainians felt no 
pressure. There is no evidence they felt 
any pressure. 
Of course, we have already had testi-
mony about how they did feel pressure, 
and they didn’t want to be drawn into 
this political campaign. You saw over

January 22, 2020 
and over in these text messages and 
emails: No, you go first. You announce. 
No, you go first. Yet we are supposed to 
believe they felt no pressure? There it 
is. It breaks out into the open. The 
military aid is being withheld, and 
there is a connection between the hold-
ing of the military aid and these inves-
tigations. 
The first thing they are asking 
about—and they send the copy of the 
article—is: What is happening with this 
aid? They are ready to come to DC to 
plead for the aid. They go to Warsaw. 
They meet with the Vice President. 
The first question is the aid. 
And what happens after that meet-
ing? Now, that was a big meeting, by 
the way, with the Vice President and 
the Ukrainian delegation. It is not 
likely, in front of all of those people, 
the Vice President is going to bring it 
up. 
So Sondland goes up to his counter-
part right after that, on the sidelines 
of that meeting, and he says basically: 
Ya ain’t getting the money until you 
do the investigations. 
And we are to believe they felt no 
pressure? Folks, they are at war. They 
are at war, and they are being told: 
You are not getting $400 million in aid 
you need unless you do what the Presi-
dent wants, and what the President 
wants are these two investigations. 
If you don’t believe that is pressure, 
that is $400 million worth of pressure, I 
got a bridge I want to sell you. 
It is hard for to us put ourselves in 
the Ukrainians’ position. I mean, imag-
ine if the eastern third of our country 
were occupied by an enemy force, and 
we are beholden to another country for 
military aid, and they are saying: You 
are not going to get it until you do 
what we want. Do you think we would 
feel pressure? I think we would feel 
pressure, and that is exactly the situa-
tion the Ukrainians were in. 
You heard the other counsel say be-
fore: Well, but they say they don’t feel 
pressure—like they are going to admit 
they were being shaken down by the 
President of the United States. You 
think they feel pressure now, you 
should see what kind of pressure they 
would feel if they admitted that. 
Tim Morrison, the NSC official, wit-
nessed 
the 
conversation 
between 
Sondland and Yermak from across the 
room and immediately thereafter re-
ceived the summary from Ambassador 
Sondland. He reported the substance of 
that conversation to his boss, Ambas-
sador Bolton. He told Morrison to 
‘‘consult with the lawyers.’’ Go talk to 
the lawyers. 
You know, if you keep getting told 
you got to go talk to the lawyers, there 
is a problem. If things are perfect, you 
don’t get told ‘‘go talk to the lawyers’’ 
time and again. 
Morrison confirmed that he did talk 
to the lawyers, in part to ensure there 
was a record of what Ambassador 
Sondland was doing. That record exists 
within the White House. Would you 
like me to read you that record? I 
would be happy to read you that 
record. It is there for your asking. Of 
course the President has refused to 
provide that record. 
Precisely 
why 
did 
Ambassador 
Bolton direct Morrison to tell the law-
yers, talk to the lawyers? Would you 
like Ambassador Bolton to tell you 
why he said that? He would be happy to 
tell you why he said that. He is there 
for your asking. 
What did Bolton know about the 
freeze in aid prior to this meeting in 
Warsaw? What did he mean that he can 
press Zelensky—it is going to depend 
on whether you can press Zelensky? 
Would you like to know what that 
meant? I would like to know what he 
meant by that. I think we know what 
he meant by that. 
Tim Morrison also conveyed the sub-
stance of the Sondland-Yermak pull- 
aside to his colleague Ambassador Tay-
lor. So this is now Tim Morrison told 
by Bolton ‘‘go talk to the lawyers,’’ 
and he talks to, also, Ambassador Tay-
lor, our Ambassador in Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. On the evening of 
September 1st, I received a readout of the 
Pence-Zelensky meeting over the phone from 
Mr. Morrison during which he told me that 
President Zelensky had opened the meeting 
by immediately asking the Vice President 
about the security cooperation. The Vice 
President did not respond substantively but 
said that he would talk to President Trump 
that night. The Vice President did say that 
President Trump wanted the Europeans to 
do more to support Ukraine and that he 
wanted the Ukrainians to do more to fight 
corruption. 
During the same phone call with Mr. Mor-
rison, he described the conversation Ambas-
sador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak in 
Warsaw. Ambassador Sondland told Mr. 
Yermak that the security assistance money 
would not come until President Zelensky 
committed to pursue the Burisma investiga-
tion. 
I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told 
me about the Sondland-Yermak conversa-
tion. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador 
Taylor then explained why he was so 
alarmed by this turn. Let’s hear that 
as well. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. You said previously that 
you were alarmed to learn this. Why were 
you alarmed? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. It is one thing to 
try to leverage a meeting in the White 
House; it is another thing, I thought, to le-
verage security assistance—security assist-
ance to a country at war dependent on both 
the security assistance and the demonstra-
tion of support. It was—it was much more 
alarming. The White House meeting was one 
thing, security assistance was much more 
alarming. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Upon learning 
from Mr. Morrison that the military 
aid may be conditioned on Ukraine 
publicly announcing these two inves-
tigations, Ambassador Taylor sends an 
urgent text message to Ambassador 
Sondland asking: ‘‘Are we now saying 
that security assistance and White 
House meeting are conditioned on in-
vestigations?’’ And the response by 
Ambassador Sondland: ‘‘Call me.’’ 
Well, you know what that means, 
right? You get a text message that is 
putting it in black and white: 
Are we saying security assistance 
and the White House meeting are con-
ditioned on investigations? 
Call me. 
In other words, don’t put this in writ-
ing; call me. 
Ambassador Taylor did, in fact, call 
Sondland. Informed by notes he took at 
the time of the call, he summarized 
that conversation as follows. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. During that phone 
call Ambassador Sondland told me that 
President Trump had told him that he wants 
President Zelensky to state publicly that 
Ukraine will investigate Burisma and al-
leged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion. 
Ambassador Sondland also told me that he 
now recognized that he had made a mistake 
by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that 
only a White House meeting with President 
Zelensky was dependent on a public an-
nouncement of the investigation. In fact, 
Ambassador Sondland said, ‘‘Everything was 
dependent on such an announcement, includ-
ing security assistance.’’ 
He said that President Trump wanted 
President Zelensky in a public box when 
making a public statement about ordering 
such investigations. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador 
Taylor testified that his contempora-
neous notes of the call reflect that 
Sondland used the phrase ‘‘public box’’ 
to describe President Trump’s desire to 
ensure that the initiation of his desired 
investigations was announced publicly. 
A private commitment was not good 
enough. 
The State Department has Ambas-
sador Taylor’s extensive notes, and of 
course we would like to show them to 
you to corroborate his testimony, but 
pursuant to the President’s instruc-
tions, the State Department will not 
turn them over. 
You might recall from the tape yes-
terday that Ambassador Taylor said: 
They’ll be shortly coming, I’m told. 
Well, somebody countermanded that 
instruction. Who do we think that was? 
But you should see them. If you have 
any question about what Sondland told 
Ambassador Taylor, if the President’s 
counsel tries to create any confusion 
about what Sondland told Taylor about 
his conversation with the President— 
and, look, Sondland had one recollec-
tion in his deposition and another 
recollection in the first hearing and an-
other recollection in the declaration. 
You want to know exactly what hap-
pened in that conversation when it was 
fresh in Sondland’s mind and he told 
Taylor about it and Taylor wrote it in 
his notes, you are going to want Tay-
lor’s notes. 
In any courtroom in America holding 
a fair trial, you would want to see con-
temporaneous 
notes. 
This 
Senate 
should be no different. Demand those 
notes. Demand to see the truth. We are 
not afraid of those notes. We haven’t 
seen them. We haven’t seen them. 
Maybe those notes say something com-
pletely different. Maybe those notes

say no quid pro quo. Maybe those notes 
say it was a perfect call. I would like to 
see them. I am willing to trust Ambas-
sador Taylor’s testimony and his recol-
lection. I would like to see them. I 
would like to show them to you. They 
are yours for the asking. 
On September 25, the Washington 
Post editorial board reported concerns 
that President Trump was withholding 
military assistance for Ukraine and a 
White House meeting in order to force 
President Zelensky to announce inves-
tigations of Vice President Biden and 
purported Ukrainian interference in 
the U.S. election. 
The Post editorial board wrote: 
But we’re reliably told that the president 
has a second and more venal agenda: He is 
attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to inter-
vene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by 
launching an investigation of the leading 
Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump 
is not just soliciting Ukraine’s help with his 
Presidential campaign; he is using U.S. mili-
tary aid the country desperately needs in an 
attempt to extort it. 
So that is September 5. The Presi-
dent on notice: Scheme discovered. 
September 5. 
September 7, the evidence shows, 
President Trump has a call with Am-
bassador Sondland where the President 
made the corrupt argument for mili-
tary aid and the White House meeting 
even more explicit. 
On 
September 
7, 
Ambassador 
Sondland spoke to President Trump on 
the telephone. After that conversation, 
Ambassador Sondland called Tim Mor-
rison to update him on that conversa-
tion. Unlike Sondland, who testified 
that he never took notes, Morrison 
took notes of the conversation and re-
called it during his public testimony. 
Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Attorney GOLDMAN. Now, a few days 
later, on September 7, you spoke again to 
Ambassador Sondland, who told you that he 
had just gotten off the phone with President 
Trump. Isn’t that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. That sounds correct, yes. 
Attorney GOLDMAN. What did Ambas-
sador Sondland tell you that President 
Trump said to him? 
Mr. MORRISON. If I recall this conversa-
tion correctly, this was where Ambassador 
Sondland related that there was no quid pro 
quo but President Zelensky had to make the 
statement and that he had to want to do it. 
Attorney GOLDMAN. And by that point, 
did you understand that the statement re-
lated to Biden and the 2016 investigations? 
Mr. MORRISON. I think I did, yes. 
Attorney GOLDMAN. And that that was 
essentially a condition for the security as-
sistance to be released? 
Mr. MORRISON. I understood that that’s 
what Ambassador Sondland believed. 
Attorney GOLDMAN. After speaking with 
President Trump? 
Mr. MORRISON. That’s what he rep-
resented. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I ask you to 
bear in mind that when Mr. Morrison 
said that is what he represented, that 
we asked Mr. Morrison about the Presi-
dent’s 
calls 
with 
Ambassador 
Sondland, and he testified that every 
time he checked to see did Ambassador 
Sondland in fact talk to the President 
when he said that he did, that, yes, in 
fact, he talked with the President. 
Every time he checked, he was able to 
confirm it. 
Now, let’s let this sink in for a 
minute. According to Mr. Morrison’s 
testimony—former Republican staffer 
on the Armed Services Committee—he 
speaks with Sondland on September 7, 
and Sondland says he has just gotten 
off the phone with Trump, OK? So this 
is contemporaneous. Just got off the 
phone with him. Call is fresh in 
everybody’s mind. And what was said? 
Morrison says Ambassador Sondland 
related there was no quid pro quo but 
President Zelensky had to make the 
statement and he had to want to do it. 
No quid pro quo, but there is a quid pro 
quo. 
Now, there are notes that show this. 
There is a written record of this. There 
is a written record of what President 
Trump 
told 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
right after that call. Would you like to 
see that written record? It is called Mr. 
Morrison’s notes. It is right there for 
the asking. 
These fine lawyers over here want to 
persuade you that call didn’t happen or 
it wasn’t said or all he said was no quid 
pro quo; he never said, but you have to 
go to the mic and you have to want to 
do it. Well, there is a good way to find 
out what happened on that call because 
it is in writing. 
Is there any question why they are 
withholding this from Congress? Is 
there any question about that? Did it 
claim—well, Mr. Morrison didn’t claim 
absolute 
immunity. 
Mr. 
Sondland 
didn’t claim absolute immunity. There 
is no absolute immunity over these 
notes, no executive privilege over these 
notes. The notes have already been de-
scribed. The conversation has already 
been released. There is no even plau-
sible, arguable, invented, even, excuse 
for withholding these notes. Would you 
like to see them? I will tell you, in any 
courtroom in America you would get to 
see them. This should be no different. 
It wouldn’t be any different in a fair 
trial anywhere in America. 
Morrison again informed Ambassador 
Bolton of this September 7 conversa-
tion, 
and 
guess 
what 
Ambassador 
Bolton said? I think you can probably 
figure this out by now: Go talk to the 
lawyers. Go talk to the lawyers. And 
yet again, for the third time, Morrison 
went to talk to the lawyers about this 
conversation 
with 
Ambassador 
Sondland. 
Morrison 
also 
called 
Ambassador 
Taylor to inform him about the con-
versation, and we have the testimony 
from Ambassador Taylor about their 
conversation, which is also based on 
his contemporaneous notes. 
Let’s look at the conversation now 
between Mr. Morrison and Ambassador 
Taylor. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. According to Mr. 
Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador 
Sondland he was not asking for a quid pro 
quo. President Trump did insist that Presi-
dent Zelensky go to a microphone and say he 
is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 
election interference and that President 
Zelensky should want to do this himself. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. OK, so here we 
have two witnesses taking contempora-
neous notes, both reflecting the same 
conversation—a conversation between 
Sondland and the President in which 
the President says, ‘‘No quid pro quo,’’ 
but quid pro quo. There are documents 
that prove this—documents that prove 
this that are yours for the asking. 
The following day, September 8, 
Sondland texts Taylor and Volker to 
bring them up to speed on the con-
versations with President Trump and, 
subsequently, 
President 
Zelensky, 
whom he spoke to after President 
Trump: ‘‘Guys, multiple conversations 
with Z,’’ meaning Zelensky. ‘‘POTUS. 
Let’s talk.’’ 
Sondland spoke to Taylor shortly 
after this text, according to Ambas-
sador Taylor. He testified again on his 
real time notes. Let’s hear what he 
said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. The following day 
on September 8, Ambassador Sondland and I 
spoke on the phone, and he confirmed he had 
talked with President Trump, as I suggested 
a week earlier, but President Trump was ad-
amant that President Zelensky himself had 
to clean things up and do it in public. Presi-
dent Trump said it was not a quid pro quo. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is all very 
consistent here, what the President 
said. No quid pro quo, but Zelensky 
must announce the investigations pub-
licly, 
was 
what 
he 
was 
telling 
Sondland—no quid pro quo except for 
the quid pro quo. 
The President’s attorneys would like 
you to remember the first half of that 
sentence and would like to forget the 
second half ever happened, but we don’t 
have to leave our common sense at the 
door, and we don’t have to rely on an 
incomplete description of that call. We 
have instead the detailed notes of Mr. 
Morrison and Ambassador Taylor. 
We also know what President Trump 
told Sondland because Sondland re-
layed 
that 
message 
to 
President 
Zelensky. During the same September 
8 conversation with Taylor, Sondland 
described his conversation with Presi-
dent Zelensky. 
Here is Ambassador Taylor’s account 
of it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador 
TAYLOR. 
Ambassador 
Sondland also said that he had talked with 
President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had 
told them that although this was not a quid 
pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear 
things up in public, we would be at a stale-
mate. I understood a stalemate to mean that 
Ukraine would not receive the much-needed 
military assistance. 
Ambassador Sondland said that this con-
versation concluded with President Zelensky 
agreeing to make a public statement in an 
interview on CNN. 
So 
not 
only 
did 
Ambassador 
Sondland relate this conversation to 
Mr. Morrison and Mr. Taylor, not only 
did Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morri-
son talk about it, but Sondland said he

S479 
January 22, 2020 
relayed this conversation to Zelensky 
himself. Everyone was now in the loop 
on the military aid being withheld for 
the political investigations. 
Taylor continued recalling the star-
tling analogy Ambassador Sondland 
used to describe President Trump’s ap-
proach to Ukraine: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. During our meet-
ing—during our call on September 8, Ambas-
sador Sondland tried to explain to me that 
President Trump was a businessman, and 
when a businessman is about to sign a check 
to someone who owes him something, the 
business man asks that person to pay up be-
fore signing the check. Ambassador Volker 
used the same language several days later 
while we were together at the Yalta Euro-
pean strategy conference. I argued to both 
that the explanation made no sense. Ukrain-
ians did not owe President Trump anything. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador 
Taylor testified that at the end of the 
Sondland-Zelensky 
conversation, 
President Zelensky said that he had re-
lented and had agreed to do a CNN 
interview to announce the investiga-
tions. 
So there was a breakthrough after 
all. 
The 
promised 
meeting 
wasn’t 
enough. The withheld security assist-
ance broke the logjam. Zelensky was 
going to go on CNN and announce the 
investigations. 
Taylor, though, remained concerned 
that even if the Ukrainian leader did as 
President Trump required, President 
Trump might continue to withhold the 
vital U.S. security assistance in any 
event. Ambassador Taylor texted his 
concerns to Ambassador Volker and 
Sondland stating: 
Ambassador TAYLOR. The nightmare is 
they give the interview and don’t get the se-
curity assistance. The Russians love it. (And 
I quit.) 
That is quite telling, too. 
What is Ambassador Taylor is wor-
ried about? He is worried the Ukrain-
ians are finally going to agree to do it. 
They are going to make the announce-
ment, and they are still going to get 
stiffed on the aid. 
In his deposition, Ambassador Taylor 
elaborated: 
Ambassador TAYLOR. ‘‘The nightmare’’ is 
the scenario where President Zelensky goes 
out in public, makes an announcement that 
he’s going to investigate Burisma and the in-
terference in the 2016 election, maybe among 
other things. He might put that in some se-
ries of investigations. But . . . the night-
mare was he would mention those two, take 
all the heat from that, get himself in big 
trouble in this country— 
Meaning the United States— 
and probably in his country as well, and 
the security assistance would not be re-
leased. That was the nightmare. 
If it were to happen, Taylor has testi-
fied, he would quit. 
Early in the morning in Europe on 
September 9, which was 12:47 a.m. in 
Washington, DC, Ambassador Taylor 
reiterated 
his 
concerns 
about 
the 
President’s quid pro quo for security 
assistance in another series of text 
messages with Ambassadors Volker 
and Sondland. 
Here are the September 9 text mes-
sages. Taylor texts to Sondland: 
The messages from the Ukrainians (and 
Russians) we send with the decision on secu-
rity assistance is key. With the hold, we 
have already shaken their faith in us. Thus 
my nightmare scenario. 
Taylor goes on and says: 
Counting on you to be right about this 
interview, Gordon. 
Meaning, if they do it, you darn well 
better come through with the military 
aid. 
And Sondland says: 
Bill, I never said I was ‘‘right.’’ I said we 
are where we are and believe we have identi-
fied the best pathway forward. Let’s hope it 
works. 
Taylor said: 
As I said on the phone, I think it is crazy 
to withhold security assistance for help with 
a political campaign. 
Ambassador Taylor testified what he 
meant. He said that to withhold that 
assistance for no good reason other 
than to help with a political campaign 
made 
no 
sense. 
It 
was 
counter-
productive to all of what we were try-
ing to do. It was illogical. It could not 
be explained. It was crazy. 
In response to Ambassador Taylor’s 
text 
message, 
Sondland 
replies 
at 
about 5 a.m. in Washington. So the 
message from Taylor goes out at 12:47 
a.m. The message back from Sondland 
comes at 5 a.m. So it looks like it 
might be 5 hours later. 
So Taylor has texted at 12:47 a.m.: 
As I said on the phone, I think it is crazy 
to hold security assistance for help with a 
political campaign. 
There he is again, putting it in writ-
ing, 
for 
crying 
out 
loud. 
Hadn’t 
Sondland said to call him about this 
stuff? 
So 5 hours later, you get this really 
interesting message from Sondland: 
Bill, I believe you are incorrect about 
President Trump’s intentions. The President 
has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of 
any kind. The President is trying to evaluate 
whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt 
transparency 
reforms 
that 
President 
Zelensky promised during his campaign. I 
suggest we stop the back and forth by text. 
In other words, can you please stop 
putting this in writing? Congress may 
read this one day. 
If you still have concerns, I recommend 
you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss 
them directly. Thanks. 
As 
you 
can 
see 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s subsequent testimony re-
veals that this text and other denials 
of a quid pro quo were intentionally 
false and simply designed to provide a 
written record of a false explanation 
that could later be used to conceal 
wrongdoing. 
The text message said there were no 
quid pro quos of any kind, but you have 
seen his testimony. He swore under 
oath. He was crystal clear when he said 
there was a quid pro quo for the White 
House meeting, and he subsequently 
testified there was a quid pro quo for 
the security assistance, as well, as con-
firmed by President Trump’s direction 
to him on September 7. 
Sondland’s recollection of this con-
versation with President Trump, as I 
mentioned, has evolved over time. Ini-
tially, in his deposition, he testified 
that the conversation with the Presi-
dent occurred between Taylor’s text of 
September 9th at 12:47, Washington 
time, and his response at 5 a.m. He re-
called very little of the conversation at 
that time other than his belief that his 
text 
message 
reflected 
President 
Trump’s response. 
Subsequently, 
though—and 
again, 
this is one of the reasons why you do 
depositions in closed session. Subse-
quently, after the opening statements 
of the testimony of Ambassador Taylor 
and Mr. Morrison were released, which 
described in overlapping and painful 
detail Sondland’s conversation with 
President Trump on September 7, Am-
bassador Sondland submitted an adden-
dum to his deposition testimony, which 
in relevant part said this: 
Finally, as of this writing, I cannot specifi-
cally recall if I had one or two phone calls 
with President Trump in the September 6–9 
time frame. Despite repeated requests to the 
White House and the State Department, I 
have not been granted access to all the 
phone records, and I would like to review 
those phone records along with any other 
notes and other documents that may exist to 
determine if I can provide a more complete 
testimony to assist Congress. However, al-
though I have no specific recollection of 
phone calls during this period with Ambas-
sador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, I have no 
reason to question the substance of their 
recollections about my September 1 con-
versation with Mr. Yermak. 
During his public testimony, Ambas-
sador Sondland purported to remember 
more of his conversation with Presi-
dent Trump, although he still main-
tained he couldn’t remember if it was 
on September 7 or September 9. 
According to his testimony, Presi-
dent Trump did not specifically say 
there was a quid pro quo. But when 
Sondland simply asked the President 
what he wanted from Ukraine, Presi-
dent Trump immediately brought up a 
quid pro quo. According to Sondland, 
President Trump said: 
I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I 
want Zelensky to do the right thing. 
And I said: What does that mean? 
And he said: I want him to do what he ran 
on. 
In his subsequent testimony, Ambas-
sador Sondland explained that Trump’s 
reference to what he ran on was a nod 
to rooting out corruption. Here, how-
ever, corruption, like Burisma, has be-
come code for the investigations that 
President Trump has sought. 
So 
you 
have 
got 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s 
emerging 
recollection. 
What you got is actually written notes 
taken at the time that he does not con-
test, written notes from Ambassador 
Taylor and Mr. Morrison, notes which I 
believe will reflect quite clearly the 
understanding of ‘‘dirt for dollars’’ 
that was confirmed by this telephone 
call to President Trump.

suaded

thought that the aid was conditioned on the 
public announcement of the investigation 
after speaking to President Trump. 
Ambassador SONDLAND. By September 8, 
I was absolutely convinced it was. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And President Trump did 
not dissuade you of that in the conversation 
that you noted you had with him? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I don’t recall, be-
cause that would have changed my calculus. 
If President Trump had told me directly— 
Mr. GOLDMAN. No, I’m not asking that. I 
am just saying, you still believed the secu-
rity assistance was conditioned on the inves-
tigation, after you spoke to President 
Trump; yes or no? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. From a time-
frame standpoint, yes. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. OK, so here we 
have Sondland saying that whatever 
his recollection may be about that call, 
he was still very clear what the Presi-
dent wanted and he was very clear 
there was a quid pro quo. That is con-
sistent, obviously, with what Mr. Mor-
rison had to say and Ambassador Tay-
lor. In other words, he didn’t believe 
President Trump’s denial of a quid pro 
quo, and neither should you. 
Sondland’s understanding was fur-
ther confirmed by President Trump’s 
own Chief of Staff. On October 17, in a 
press briefing at the White House, Mick 
Mulvaney 
admitted 
that 
President 
Trump withheld essential military aid 
to Ukraine as leverage to pressure 
Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine had interfered in 
the 2016 election. 
Mr. MULVANEY. Those were the driving 
factors. But he also mentioned to me that 
the corruption related to the DNC server. 
Absolutely, no question about it. But that is 
it. That is why we held up the money. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. When pressed 
that he had just convinced them of the 
very quid pro quo that President 
Trump had been denying, Mulvaney 
doubled down. Let’s listen to that. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Question. But to be clear, what you just 
described is a quid pro quo. It is: Funding 
will not flow unless the investigation into 
the Democratic server happens as well. 
Mr. MULVANEY. We do that all the time 
with foreign policy. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This evidence 
demonstrates that President Trump 
withheld the security assistance and 
the White House meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky until Ukraine made a 
public statement announcing the two 
investigations targeted to help his po-
litical reelection efforts. But as you 
will learn next, he got caught, and a 
coverup ensued. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, thank you for 
your patience. This is a lot of informa-
tion, but you have a very important 
obligation, and that is, ultimately, to 
decide whether the President com-
mitted impeachable offenses. In order 
to make that judgment, you have to 
have all of the facts. 
We are going through this chro-
nology. We are close to being done, but 
it is important to know that while all 
of this material was going on and these 
deals were being made, there were 
other forces at work. Even before the 
President’s freeze on U.S. military as-
sistance to Ukraine became public on 
August 28, Members of both Houses of 
Congress began to express concern. 
On August 9, the Democratic leader-
ship of the House and Senate Appro-
priations Committee wrote to the OMB 
and the White House, warning that a 
hold on assistance might constitute an 
illegal impoundment of funds. They 
urged the Trump administration to fol-
low the law and obligate the funds. 
When the news of the frozen aid 
broke on August 28, congressional scru-
tiny of President Trump’s decision in-
creased. On September 3, a group of 
Senators, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, including Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN, Senator ROB PORTMAN, Senator 
DICK
DURBIN, Senator RON
JOHNSON, 
and Senator RICHARD BLUMENTHAL sent 
a letter to Acting White House Chief of 
Staff Mick Mulvaney, expressing ‘‘deep 
concerns . . . that the Administration 
is 
considering 
not 
obligating 
the 
Ukraine Security Initiative funds for 
2019.’’ 
Two days later, as has been men-
tioned, on September 5, a Washington 
Post editorial expressed concern that 
President Trump was withholding mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine in order to 
pressure President Zelensky to an-
nounce these investigations. That was 
the first public report linking the fro-
zen security aid to the investigations 
that Mr. Giuliani had been publicly 
pressing for and that President Trump, 
as we have heard, had privately urged 
President Zelensky to conduct on the 
July 25 call. 
That same day, Senators MURPHY 
and 
JOHNSON
met 
with 
President 
Zelensky in Kyiv. Ambassador Taylor 
went with them, and he testified—Mr. 
Taylor 
testified 
that 
President 
Zelensky’s ‘‘first question to the sen-
ators was about the withheld security 
assistance.’’ Ambassador Taylor testi-
fied that both Senators ‘‘stressed that 
bipartisan 
support 
for 
Ukraine 
in 
Washington was Ukraine’s most impor-
tant strategic asset and that President 
Zelensky should not jeopardize that bi-
partisan support by getting drawn into 
U.S. domestic politics.’’ 
Senator JOHNSON and Senator MUR-
PHY later submitted letters in which 
they explained that they sought to re-
assure President Zelensky that there 
was bipartisan support in Congress for 
providing Ukraine with military assist-
ance and that they would continue to 
urge President Trump to lift the hold. 
Here is what they said in that letter. 
Senator 
MURPHY
said: 
‘‘Senator 
JOHNSON and I assured Zelensky that 
Congress wanted to continue this fund-
ing, and would press Trump to release 
it immediately.’’ 
And Senator JOHNSON in the letter 
said: ‘‘I explained that I had tried to 
persuade the President to authorize me 
to announce the hold was released but 
that I was unsuccessful.’’ 
As news of the President’s hold on 
military assistance to Ukraine became 
public at the end of August, Congress, 
the press, and the public started to pay 
more attention to President Trump’s 
activities with Ukraine. This risked ex-
posing the scheme that you have heard 
so much about today. 
By now, the White House had learned 
that the inspector general of the intel-
ligence community had found that a 
whistleblower complaint related to the 
same Ukraine matter was ‘‘credible’’ 
and ‘‘an urgent concern’’ and that they 
were therefore required to send that 
complaint to Congress. 
On September 9, three House inves-
tigating committees sent a letter to 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, 
stating that President Trump and 
Giuliani ‘‘appeared to have acted out-
side legitimate law enforcement and 
diplomatic channels to coerce the 
Ukrainian government into pursuing 
two 
politically-motivated 
investiga-
tions under the guise of anti-corrup-
tion activity.’’ 
The letter also said this: ‘‘If the 
President is trying to pressure Ukraine 
into choosing between defending itself 
from Russian aggression without U.S. 
assistance or leveraging its judicial 
system to serve the ends of the Trump 
campaign, this would represent a stag-
gering abuse of power, a boon to Mos-
cow, and a betrayal of the public 
trust.’’ 
The Chairs requested that the White 
House preserve all relevant records and 
produce them by September 16. This in-
cluded the transcript—or actually the 
call record of the July 25 call between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky. 
Based on witness testimony, it looks 
like the White House Counsel’s Office 
circulated the committee’s document 
request around the White House. Tim 
Morrison, a senior director at the Na-
tional Security Council, remembered 
seeing a copy of this letter. He also re-
called that the three committees’ 
Ukraine investigation was discussed at 
a meeting of senior level NSC staff 
soon after it was publicly announced. 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman recalled 
discussions among the NSC staff mem-
bers that the investigation—and here is 
a quote—‘‘might have the effect of re-
leasing the hold on Ukraine military 
assistance because it would be poten-
tially politically challenging for the 
Administration to justify that hold to 
Congress.’’ 
Later that same day, on September 9, 
the inspector general informed the 
House and Senate Intelligence Com-
mittees he had determined that the 
whistleblower complaint that had been 
submitted on August 12 appeared to be 
credible, met the definition of urgent 
concern under the statute, and yet he 
reported that for first time ever, the 
Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence was withholding this whistle-
blower complaint from Congress. That 
violated the law, which required it to 
be in the Senate in 7 days. The Acting 
Director later testified that his office 
initially withheld the complaint based

on advice from the White House in an 
unprecedented intervention by the De-
partment of Justice. 
According to public reporting and 
testimony from the Acting DNI at a 
hearing before the House Intelligence 
Committee on September 26, the White 
House had been aware of the whistle-
blower complaint for weeks prior to 
the IG September 9 letter to the Intel-
ligence Committee. 
Acting DNI Maguire testified that 
when he received the whistleblower 
complaint from the inspector general, 
his office contacted the White House 
Counsel’s Office for guidance. Con-
sistent with Acting DNI Maguire’s tes-
timony, the New York Times has re-
ported that, in late August, the Presi-
dent’s current defense counsel, Mr. 
Cipollone, 
and 
NSC 
lawyer, 
John 
Eisenberg, personally briefed President 
Trump about the complaint’s existence 
and told the President they believed 
the complaint could be withheld from 
Congress 
on 
executive 
privilege 
grounds. 
On September 10, the next day, Am-
bassador Bolton resigned from his posi-
tion as National Security Advisor. On 
that same day, September 10, Chair-
man SCHIFF of the House Intelligence 
Committee wrote a letter to the Acting 
Director, demanding that he provide 
the complaint as the law required. The 
next day, on September 11, President 
Trump lifted the hold on the security 
assistance to Ukraine. 
Numerous witnesses have testified 
that they weren’t aware of any reason 
why the hold was lifted, just that there 
was no explanation for the hold being 
implemented. There was no additional 
review, no additional European con-
tribution, nothing to justify the Presi-
dent’s change in his position, except he 
got caught. Just as there was no offi-
cial explanation for why the hold on 
Ukrainian 
assistance 
was 
imple-
mented, numerous witnesses testified 
that they were not provided with any 
reason for why the hold was lifted on 
September 11. 
For example, Jennifer Williams, who 
was a special adviser to Vice President 
PENCE, testified that she was never 
given a reason for that decision; nei-
ther was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. 
Here is what he told us during the 
hearing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Are you also aware that 
the security assistance hold was not lifted 
for another 10 days after this meeting? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. That is correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And am I correct that you 
never did learn the reason why the hold was 
lifted? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. That is correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Colonel Vindman, you 
didn’t learn a reason why the hold was lifted 
either; is that right? 
Colonel VINDMAN. Right. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Colonel Vindman, are you 
aware that the committees launched an in-
vestigation into the Ukrainian matters on 
September 9, 2 days before the hold was lift-
ed? 
Colonel VINDMAN. I am aware, and it was 
lifted. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Ambassador 
Taylor, the person in charge at the 
U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who commu-
nicated the decision to the Ukrainians, 
also never got an explanation. Here is 
what he said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Are you also aware, how-
ever, that the security assistance hold was 
not lifted for another 10 days after this? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Finally, on Sep-
tember 11, I learned that the hold had been 
lifted and the security assistance would be 
provided. I was not told the reason why the 
hold was lifted. 
Ms. 
Manager 
LOFGREN. 
Mark 
Sandy, a career officer at OMB, testi-
fied he only learned of the possible ra-
tionale for the hold in early September 
after the Acting DNI had informed the 
White House about the whistleblower 
complaint. 
Sandy testified that sometime in 
early September he received an email 
from his boss, Michael Duffey. Approxi-
mately 2 months after the hold had 
been placed, the email ‘‘attributed the 
hold to the President’s concern about 
other countries not contributing more 
to Ukraine’’ and requested ‘‘informa-
tion about what additional countries 
were contributing to Ukraine.’’ This 
was a different explanation than OMB 
had provided at the July 26 interagency 
meeting 
that 
referenced 
concerns 
about corruption. 
The Lieutenant Colonel testified that 
none of the facts on the ground about 
Ukrainian efforts to combat corruption 
or other countries’ contributions to 
Ukraine had changed before President 
Trump lifted the hold. 
According to a press report, after 
Congress began investigating President 
Trump’s scheme, the White House 
Counsel’s Office opened an internal in-
vestigation relating to the July 25 call. 
The following slides provide excerpts 
from a report in the Washington Post. 
As part of that internal investiga-
tion, White House lawyers reportedly 
gathered and reviewed hundreds of doc-
uments that revealed extensive efforts 
to generate an after-the-fact justifica-
tion for the hold on military assistance 
for Ukraine that had been ordered by 
the President. 
These documents reportedly include 
‘‘early August email exchanges be-
tween Acting Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney and White House budget offi-
cials seeking to provide an explanation 
for withholding the funds after the 
President had already ordered a hold in 
mid-July on the nearly $400 million in 
security assistance.’’ 
The Washington Post article also re-
ported, and this is a quote: ‘‘Emails 
show OMB Director Vought and OMB 
staffers arguing that withholding the 
aid was legal, while officials at the Na-
tional Security Council and State De-
partment protested. OMB lawyers said 
that it was legal to withhold the aid, as 
long as they deemed it a temporary 
hold.’’ You should be able to see these 
documents, but the White House has 
withheld them from Congress. The 
House can’t verify the news report, but 
you could. You could do that if you 
could see these documents. You should 
subpoena them, and there is no reason 
not to see all of the relevant docu-
ments. 
The lengthy delay created by Presi-
dent Trump’s hold prevented the De-
partment of Defense from spending all 
congressionally appropriated funds by 
the end of the fiscal year, as we have 
mentioned before. That meant the 
funds were going to expire on Sep-
tember 30 because, as we know, unused 
funds do not roll over to the next fiscal 
year. This confirmed the fears ex-
pressed by Cooper, Sandy, and others— 
concerns that were discussed within 
the relevant agencies in late July and 
throughout August. 
Ultimately, approximately $35 mil-
lion of Ukraine military assistance— 
that is 14 percent of the DOD funds—re-
mained unspent by the end of the fiscal 
year. In order to make sure that 
Ukraine did not permanently lose the 
$35 million of critical military assist-
ance that had been frozen by the White 
House, Congress had to pass a provision 
on September 27—3 days before the 
funds were to expire—to ensure that 
the remaining $35 million could be sent 
to Ukraine. 
George Kent is an anti-corruption 
and rule-of-law expert. He told us that 
American 
anti-corruption 
efforts 
prioritized building institutional ca-
pacity, support for the rule of law, not 
the pursuit of individual investiga-
tions, particularly of political rivals. 
Here is how he explained their ap-
proach. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. KENT. U.S. efforts to counter corrup-
tion in Ukraine focus on building institu-
tional capacity so that the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment has the ability to go after corrup-
tion and effectively investigate, prosecute, 
and judge alleged criminal activities using 
appropriate institutional mechanisms; that 
is, to create and follow the rule of law. That 
means that if there are criminal nexuses for 
activity in the United States, U.S. law en-
forcement should pursue the case. If we 
think there’s been a criminal act overseas 
that violates U.S. law, we have the institu-
tional mechanisms to address that. It could 
be through the Justice Department and FBI 
agents assigned overseas or through treaty 
mechanisms, such as the mutual legal assist-
ance treaty. 
As a general principle, I do not believe the 
United States should ask other countries to 
engage in selective politically associated in-
vestigations or prosecutions against oppo-
nents of those in power because such selec-
tive actions undermine the rule of law, re-
gardless of the country. 
Ms. 
Manager 
LOFGREN. 
David 
Holmes concurred during his testi-
mony. Holmes also compared the offi-
cial approach that we believe in, that 
we promulgated across the world, with 
what the President and Mr. Giuliani 
actually were doing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. Our long-standing policy is 
to encourage them to establish, build rule of 
law institutions that are capable, that can 
pursue allegations. That’s our policy. We’ve 
been doing that for some time with some

success. Focusing on particular cases, par-
ticularly where there is interest of the Presi-
dent, just not part of what we’ve done. It’s 
hard to explain why we would do that. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Unfortu-
nately, we do know the explanation. 
We know why President Trump wanted 
President Zelensky to announce inves-
tigations—because it would help him in 
his election. 
On September 18, approximately a 
week before he was supposed to meet 
with President Trump at the United 
Nations General Assembly in New 
York, President Zelensky spoke by 
telephone with Vice President PENCE. 
During her deposition, Jennifer Wil-
liams testified. She was Vice President 
PENCE’s assistant. She had testified 
that Vice President PENCE basically re-
iterated that the hold on aid had been 
lifted and asked a bit more about how 
Zelensky’s efforts were going. 
Following her deposition and while 
preparing for her testimony at the 
open hearing on November 19, Williams 
reviewed the documents—they had not 
been produced to us by the White 
House—and those documents refreshed 
her recollection of Vice President 
PENCE’s call with President Zelensky. 
The White House blocked Williams 
from testifying about her refreshed 
recollections of the Vice President’s 
call when she appeared at the open 
public hearing. They claim that certain 
portions of the September 18 call, in-
cluding the information that Williams 
wanted to tell us about, were classified. 
On November 26, she submitted a 
classified addition to her hearing testi-
mony where she provided additional in-
formation about the Vice President’s 
September 18 telephone call with Presi-
dent Zelensky. The Intelligence Com-
mittee provided this classified addition 
to the Judiciary Committee. It has 
been sent to the Senate for your re-
view. Now, I have read that testimony. 
I will just say that a coverup is not a 
proper reason to classify a document. 
Vice President PENCE has repeatedly 
said publicly that he has no objection 
to the White House releasing the ac-
tual transcript of his calls with Presi-
dent Zelensky. Yet his office has re-
fused many requests by the committee 
to declassify Williams’ addendum so 
the American people could also see the 
additional evidence about this call. 
We urge the Senators to review it, 
and we again ask that the White House 
declassify them. As the House wrote in 
two separate letters, there is no basis 
to keep it classified. Again, in case the 
White House needs a reminder, it is im-
proper to keep something classified 
just to avoid embarrassment or to con-
ceal wrongdoing. 
We have been through a lot of facts 
today. We have seen the President’s 
scheme. A shakedown of Ukraine for 
his personal benefit was, I believe, an 
obvious abuse of his power. But this 
misconduct and scheme became ex-
posed. Congress asked questions. The 
press reported. Nonpolitical officers in 
the government expressed concern. The 
whistleblower laws were activated. 
As this happened, there was an effort 
to create an after-the-fact, misleading 
record to avoid responsibility for what 
the President had actually been doing. 
These were not the only efforts to hide 
misconduct, and misconduct continued. 
Congressman SCHIFF will review some 
of those items. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We have about 
20 minutes left in the presentation to-
night. 
I would like to now go through with 
you the President’s efforts to hide this 
corrupt scheme even as it continued 
well into the fall of last year. 
On August 12, a whistleblower in the 
intelligence community submitted a 
complaint addressed to the congres-
sional Intelligence Committees. This 
explosive document stated that Presi-
dent Trump had solicited foreign inter-
ference from Ukraine to assist his 2020 
reelection bid. 
The complaint alleged a scheme by 
President Trump to ‘‘us[e] the power of 
his office to solicit interference from a 
foreign country in the 2020 U.S. elec-
tion.’’ The complaint stated that the 
President had applied pressure on 
Ukraine to investigate one of the 
President’s main domestic political ri-
vals and detailed the involvement of 
the President’s personal lawyer, Rudy 
Giuliani. The complaint also stated 
that the whistleblower believed the 
President’s activities ‘‘posed risks to 
U.S. national security and undermine 
the U.S. Government’s efforts to deter 
and counter foreign interference in the 
U.S. elections.’’ 
Under the law, the whistleblower was 
required to file the complaint with the 
inspector general of the intelligence 
community, which was then required 
to vet and assess the complaint and de-
termine if it warranted reporting to 
the Intelligence Committees. The law 
gives the inspector general 14 days to 
conduct an initial review and then in-
form the Director of National Intel-
ligence about his findings. 
On August 26, the inspector general 
sent the whistleblower complaint and 
the inspector general’s preliminary de-
termination to the Acting Director of 
National Intelligence. The inspector 
general wrote that based on his review 
of the complaint, its allegations con-
stituted an ‘‘urgent concern’’ and ap-
peared ‘‘credible’’ under the statute. 
The inspector general confirmed that 
the whistleblower acted lawfully in 
bringing the complaint and credibly 
raised a legitimate concern that should 
be communicated to the Intelligence 
Committees of Congress. 
The Director of National Intelligence 
quickly informed the White House 
about the complaint. 
Under the law, the Acting Director of 
National Intelligence was required to 
forward the complaint and the inspec-
tor general’s determination to the con-
gressional Intelligence Committees no 
later than 7 days after he received 
them. The legal requirement is ex-
tremely clear. Upon receipt of the 
transmittal from the ICIG—that is the 
inspector general of the intelligence 
community—the Director shall, within 
7 calendar days of such receipt, forward 
such transmittal to the congressional 
Intelligence Committees, together with 
any comments the Director considers 
appropriate. Yet, despite the clear let-
ter of the law, the White House mobi-
lized to keep the information in the 
whistleblower complaint from Con-
gress, including by inviting the Depart-
ment of Justice to render an opinion as 
to whether the complaint could be 
withheld from Congress. 
The statutory deadline of September 
2, when the Director of National Intel-
ligence was required to turn them over 
to Congress, came and went, and the 
complaint remained hidden from Con-
gress. 
Finally, on September 9, a full week 
after the complaint was required to be 
sent to Congress—and once again, an 
urgent concern—the inspector general 
wrote to the leaders of the Intelligence 
Committees to inform them that the 
Director of National Intelligence was 
withholding 
a 
whistleblower 
com-
plaint, in direct contravention of past 
practice and the law. 
On September 24, Speaker of the 
House NANCY PELOSI announced that 
‘‘the House of Representatives is mov-
ing forward with an official impeach-
ment inquiry.’’ 
The next day, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed a resolution calling 
on the Trump administration to pro-
vide the whistleblower’s complaint im-
mediately to the congressional Intel-
ligence Committees. 
Later that day, the White House pub-
licly released the summary of the July 
25 call between President Trump and 
President Zelensky and permitted the 
Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence to provide the whistleblower’s 
complaint and related documents to 
the congressional Intelligence Commit-
tees. 
The President himself was happy to 
discuss the motivations for the scheme 
in public. That day, in a joint press 
availability with President Zelensky at 
the United Nations General Assembly, 
President Trump reiterated that he 
wanted Ukraine to investigate the 
Bidens. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. No, I want him to do 
whatever he can. This was not his fault. He 
wasn’t there. He’s just been here recently. 
But whatever he can do in terms of corrup-
tion because the corruption is massive. Now, 
when Biden’s son walks away with millions 
of dollars from Ukraine, and he knows noth-
ing, and they’re paying him millions of dol-
lars, that’s corruption. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Finally, the 
day after President Trump explained to 
the public that he wanted Ukraine to 
investigate 
former 
Vice 
President 
Biden, on the morning of September 26, 
the Intelligence Committee publicly 
released declassified redactions of two 
documents: the whistleblower’s August 
12 complaint and the inspector gen-
eral’s August 26 transmittal to the Act-
ing Director of National Intelligence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S483 
January 22, 2020 
Even after the impeachment inquiry 
into the Ukraine matter began, Presi-
dent Trump and his proxy, Rudy 
Giuliani, had continued to publicly 
urge President Zelensky to launch an 
investigation of Vice President Biden 
and alleged 2016 election interference 
by Ukraine. 
On September 30, during his remarks 
at the swearing-in of the new Labor 
Secretary, 
President 
Trump 
stated 
this. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. Now, the new President 
of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruption. 
That’s how he got elected. And I believe that 
he really means it. But there was a lot of 
corruption having to do with the 2016 elec-
tion against us. And we want to get to the 
bottom of it, and it is very important we do. 
Thank you, everyone. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here he is. 
He is meeting at the United Nations, 
September 30, and he is still pursuing 
this bogus CrowdStrike conspiracy the-
ory with the President of Ukraine. 
On October 2, in a public press avail-
ability, President Trump discussed the 
July 25 call with President Zelensky 
and stated that ‘‘the conversation was 
perfect; it couldn’t have been nicer.’’ 
He then linked his notion of corruption 
with the Biden investigation. 
On October 3, in remarks before he 
departed on Marine One, President 
Trump expressed his hope that Ukraine 
would investigate Vice President Biden 
and his son. President Trump actually 
escalated his rhetoric, urging not only 
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens but 
China too. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Question. Mr. President, what exactly did 
you hope Zelensky would do about the 
Bidens after your phone call? 
President TRUMP. Well, I would think 
that, if they were honest about it, they 
would start a major investigation into the 
Bidens. It’s a very simple answer. They 
should investigate the Bidens, because how 
does a company that’s newly formed—and all 
these companies, if you look at—and, by the 
way, likewise, China should start an inves-
tigation into the Bidens, because what hap-
pened in China is just about as bad as what 
happened with—with Ukraine. So I would 
say that President Zelensky—if it were me, I 
would recommend that they start an inves-
tigation into the Bidens. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The same day, 
President Trump tweeted that he has 
an absolute right to investigate corrup-
tion. That really means he feels he has 
an absolute right to investigate or get 
foreign countries to investigate his po-
litical opponents. The President sent a 
similar tweet the next day, once again 
linking corruption with the Biden in-
vestigation: 
As President, I have an obligation to end 
corruption, even if that means requesting 
the help of a foreign country or countries. It 
is done all the time. This has nothing to do 
with politics or a political campaign against 
the Bidens. This does have to do with their 
corruption. 
Give him credit for being so pomp-
ous. ‘‘This has nothing to do with poli-
tics or a political campaign against the 
Bidens,’’ but you have got to inves-
tigate the Bidens. I guess that is just a 
coincidence. 
President Trump continued to dem-
onstrate his eagerness to solicit foreign 
assistance related to his personal inter-
ests: ‘‘Here’s what’s okay,’’ he said. ‘‘If 
we feel there’s corruption like I feel 
there was in the 2016 campaign—there 
was tremendous corruption against me. 
If we feel there’s corruption, we have a 
right to go to a foreign country.’’ 
President Trump added that asking 
President Xi of China to investigate 
the Bidens ‘‘is certainly something we 
can start thinking about.’’ 
Even last month—even last month— 
the President and Giuliani’s scheme 
continued. During the first week of De-
cember, Giuliani traveled to Budapest, 
Kyiv, and Vienna to meet with former 
Ukrainian Government officials as part 
of a continuing effort to dig up dirt, po-
litical dirt, on Vice President Biden 
and advance the theory that Ukraine 
interfered in the 2016 election. 
Asked about his interviews of former 
Ukrainian prosecutors, Giuliani told 
the New York Times that he was act-
ing on behalf of his client, President 
Trump: ‘‘Like a good lawyer, I am 
gathering evidence to defend my client 
against the false charges being leveled 
against him.’’ Indeed, evidence ob-
tained by the House from Giuliani’s as-
sociate confirms that he had been rep-
resenting himself in as early as May 
2019 as President Trump’s personal law-
yer, doing Donald J. Trump’s personal 
bidding in his dealings with Ukraine. 
This letter of May 10, 2019, from 
Giuliani to Zelensky says, among other 
things: 
However, I have a more specific request. In 
my capacity as personal counsel to President 
Trump and with his knowledge and consent, 
I request a meeting with you on this upcom-
ing Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I 
will need no more than a half-hour of your 
time, and I will be accompanied by my col-
league Victoria Toensing, a distinguished 
American attorney who is very familiar with 
this matter. 
Please have your office let me know what 
time or times are convenient for you, and 
Victoria and I will be there. 
This is evidence recently obtained 
showing his effort to get that meeting 
in May with Zelensky. Giuliani told 
the Wall Street Journal that, when he 
returned to New York from his most 
recent trip on December 7, President 
Trump called him as his plane was still 
taxiing down the runway: ‘‘What did 
you get?’’ he said President Trump 
asked. ‘‘More than you can imagine,’’ 
Giuliani replied. Giuliani claimed that 
he was putting his findings into a 20- 
page report and that the President had 
asked him to brief the Attorney Gen-
eral and the Republicans in Congress. 
Shortly thereafter, on the same day, 
President Trump told reporters before 
departing on Marine One that he was 
aware of Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine 
and that Giuliani was going to report 
his purported findings to the Attorney 
General and Congress. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. Well, I just know he 
came back from someplace, and he’s going to 
make a report, I think to the Attorney Gen-
eral and to Congress. He says he has a lot of 
good information. I have not spoken to him 
about that information. But Rudy, as you 
know, has been one of the great crime fight-
ers of the last 50 years. And he did get back 
from Europe just recently, and I know—he 
has not told me what he found, but I think 
he wants to go before Congress and say—and 
also to the Attorney General and the Depart-
ment of Justice. I hear he’s found plenty, 
yeah. 
Three days after those remarks on 
December 10, Giuliani confirmed to the 
Washington Post that President Trump 
had asked him to brief the Justice De-
partment and Republican Senators on 
his ‘‘findings’’ from his trip to Ukraine. 
Giuliani stated: 
He wants me to do it. I’m working on pull-
ing it together and hope to have it done by 
the end of the week. 
That Friday, December 13, Giuliani 
reportedly met with President Trump 
at the White House, and on December 
17 Giuliani confirmed to CNN that 
President Trump has been very sup-
portive of his efforts to dig up dirt on 
Vice President Biden and Ukraine and 
that they are on the same page. 
The following day, on December 18, 
2019, the House of Representatives ap-
proved the two Articles of Impeach-
ment you are considering in this trial. 
Since the House voted on these arti-
cles, evidence has continued to come to 
light related to the President’s corrupt 
scheme. Among other things, Freedom 
of Information Act lawsuits, press re-
porting, and documents provided to 
Congress from Rudy Giuliani associate 
Lev Parnas further corroborate what 
we already know about the President’s 
scheme. 
As Giuliani again said on December 
17, President Trump has been ‘‘very 
supportive’’ of his efforts to dig up dirt 
on Vice President Biden and they are 
‘‘on the same page.’’ 
Parnas further corroborated what we 
already know about President Trump’s 
scheme; that he was responsible for 
withholding 
military 
aid 
and 
sus-
taining that hold and that his personal 
attorney, Mr. Giuliani, was working at 
the direction of President Trump him-
self. 
On December 20, new emails were re-
leased showing that, 91 minutes after 
President Trump’s call with Ukrainian 
President Zelensky, a top Office of 
Management and Budget aide asked 
the Department of Defense to hold off 
on sending military aid to Ukraine. So 
those were new documents that came 
on December 20. 
On December 29, revelations emerged 
from OMB Director and Acting Chief of 
Staff 
Mick 
Mulvaney’s 
role 
about 
them—about that role in the delay of 
aid and efforts by lawyers at OMB, the 
Department of Justice, and the White 
House to justify the delay and the 
alarm that the delay caused within the 
administration. Those records just be-
came available on December 29. 
On January 2, newly unredacted Pen-
tagon emails which raised serious con-
cerns by Trump administration offi-
cials about the legality of the Presi-
dent’s hold on aid became available.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S484 
January 22, 2020 
On January 6, former Trump Na-
tional Security Advisor John Bolton 
announced that he would comply with 
a Senate subpoena compelling his tes-
timony. His lawyers stated that he has 
new relevant information. 
On January 13, reports emerged that 
the Russian Government hacked the 
Ukrainian gas company Burisma, al-
most certainly in an effort to find in-
formation about Vice President Joe 
Biden’s son in order to weaponize that 
information against Mr. Biden and in 
favor of Mr. Trump, just as Russia did 
against Secretary Clinton in favor of 
then-candidate Trump in 2016. 
That brings us up to January 13 of 
this year. Last week, House commit-
tees received new evidence from Lev 
Parnas that further demonstrates that 
the President was a central player in 
this scheme to pressure Ukraine for his 
political gain. Also last week, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office found 
that President Trump violated the law 
when he withheld that aid. 
Last night we had further develop-
ment when more redacted emails from 
the Office of Management and Budget 
were produced. I think Representative 
CROW
showed you these. These are 
among the documents that were just 
released. I am sure that, if we could 
read under those redactions, it would 
be a very perfect email, but you have 
to ask: What is being redacted here? 
What is so important to keep confiden-
tial during the course of an impeach-
ment inquiry? 
As you can see, right up until last 
night, evidence continues to be pro-
duced. The truth is going to come out. 
Indeed, the truth has already come out, 
but more and more of it will. More 
emails are going to come out. More 
witnesses are going to come forward. 
They are going to have more relevant 
information to share. 
The only question is, Do you want to 
hear it now? Do you want to know the 
full truth now? Do you want to know 
just who was in the loop? It sounds like 
everyone was in the loop. Do you want 
to know how broad this scheme was? 
We have the evidence to prove that 
President Trump ordered the aid with-
held. He did so to coerce Ukraine to 
help his reelection campaign. He with-
held a White House meeting to coerce 
the same sham investigations. We can 
and will prove President Trump guilty 
of this conduct and of obstructing the 
investigation into his misconduct, but 
you and the American people should 
know who else was involved in this 
scheme. You should want the whole 
truth to come out. You should want to 
know about every player in this sordid 
business. It is within your power to do 
so, and I would urge you, even if you 
are prepared to vote to convict and im-
peach and remove this President, to 
find out the full truth about how far 
this corruption goes because I think 
the public has a right to know. 
Now, today—well, yesterday we made 
the case for why you should hear this 
additional evidence and testimony. 
This morning, I introduced you to the 
broad sweep of the President’s conduct, 
and then, during the course of today, 
we walked you through a factual chro-
nology in realtime about how this plot 
unfolded. During that factual chro-
nology today, you saw that, in March 
of this year, Giuliani began that smear 
campaign 
against 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch in order to get her fired 
by President Trump, something he 
would later admit was necessary to get 
her out of the way because she was 
going to be in the way of these two in-
vestigations. 
This is the supposed anticorruption 
effort by the President: to get rid of a 
woman who has dedicated her career to 
representing the United States, often 
in dangerous parts of the world, to 
fighting corruption, and to promoting 
the rule of law. This plot begins with 
getting her out of the way, with the 
President saying that ‘‘she is going to 
go 
through 
some 
things.’’ 
This 
anticorruption reformer, this U.S. pa-
triot—this plot begins with getting her 
out of the way. 
This says so much about the adminis-
tration. Tellingly, it wasn’t enough 
just to recall her or fire her. The Presi-
dent could have done that anytime. No. 
They wanted to destroy her because 
she had the audacity to stand in their 
way. 
So we heard in March about the ef-
fort to get rid of her, and it succeeded. 
And guess what message that sent to 
the Ukrainians about the power the 
President’s lawyer has. The Ukrainians 
were watching this whole saga. They 
were hearing his interviews. They were 
seeing the smears he was putting out. 
And this attorney for the President, 
working hand in hand with these cor-
rupt Ukrainians, was able to get a UN 
ambassador yanked out of her job. 
Proof positive—you want a window to 
this President, you want entre to this 
President, you want to make things 
happen with this President, you go 
through his lawyer. Never mind the 
State Department, never mind the Na-
tional Security Council, never mind 
the 
Defense 
Department—you 
go 
through his employer. That is March. 
In April, Zelensky has this huge vic-
tory in the Presidential election. He 
gets a congratulatory call from the 
President. The President assigns Vice 
President PENCE to go to the inaugura-
tion. 
In May, Giuliani is rebuffed by 
Zelensky, cancels the trip to Ukraine— 
the one where he wanted to go, remem-
ber, and meddle in the investigation 
because, Giuliani says, enemies of 
Trump surround Zelensky. I guess that 
means he didn’t get the money, and 
they must be enemies of the President. 
Of course, the Ukrainians know why he 
wants that meeting. 
In May, Trump disinvites PENCE to 
the 
inauguration. 
PENCE
is 
going, 
Giuliani is rebuffed, PENCE isn’t going. 
That is May. 
Instead, May 23, we have this meet-
ing at the White House, and there is a 
new party in town: the three amigos. 
They are going to be handling the 
Ukraine portfolio. They are told: Work 
with Rudy, work with Rudy. Ambas-
sador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, 
Secretary Perry, work with Rudy. 
As you saw in June, Rudy is pushing 
for these investigations, and they are 
trying to arrange these meetings and 
trying to make this happen. Also in 
June, the Defense Department an-
nounces they are going the release the 
military aid. The President reads about 
this, and then he stops it. He stops the 
aid. 
In July—July 10—you heard in the 
chronology, there is a meeting at the 
White House, the meeting in which 
Sondland blurts out in this meeting be-
tween the Ukrainians and Americans: 
Hey, they have a deal. They are trying 
to get this meeting, and there is a de-
bate whether the meeting is going to 
happen and when it is going to happen. 
Sondland says: Hey, we have a deal 
with Mulvaney here. We are going to 
get this meeting, and you are going to 
do those investigations. 
Bolton stiffens and abruptly ends the 
meeting. That was the first meeting 
that day. Then Sondland brings the 
delegation to a different part of the 
White House, and they have the fol-
lowup meeting where he makes it even 
more explicit—this drug deal is made 
even more explicit. Dr. Hill is told by 
Ambassador Bolton: You need to go 
talk to the lawyers; I don’t want any 
part of this drug deal they are cooking 
up. That is July. 
July is the month where that email 
goes from Sondland to Pompeo and 
others, and everybody is in the loop. 
July is the month where the hold is im-
plemented with no explanation. July is 
the month where Mueller testifies 
about Russia’s systemic interference in 
our affairs. July is the month after 
Mueller testifies that the President be-
lieves he has escaped accountability. 
The next day in July is, of course, 
the July 25 call in which the President 
asks for his favor. July 26 is the date of 
the call between President Trump and 
Ambassador Sondland. You know the 
one: ‘‘Zelensky loves your ass,’’ and he 
will do anything you want. 
Is he going to do the investigation? 
Yeah, he is going to do the investiga-
tion. 
July is the month of that conversa-
tion 
between 
Sondland 
and 
David 
Holmes, where Holmes says: Can you 
tell me candidly here what the Presi-
dent thinks of Ukraine? Does he give a 
‘‘blank’’ about Ukraine? No, he doesn’t 
give a ‘‘blank’’ about Ukraine. He only 
cares about the big stuff. 
Well, it is kind of big stuff here in 
Ukraine, like a war with the Russians. 
No, no, no. Big stuff that affects him 
personally, like the Biden investiga-
tion that Giuliani wants. That is the 
month of July. 
In August, we have that meeting be-
tween Giuliani and Yermak in Madrid. 
In August, we have the back and forth 
about the statement: No, you go first,

and you commit and publicly announce 
investigations, and then we will give 
you a date. 
No, you go first. You give us the 
date, and then we will announce the in-
vestigations. 
Well, we will give you a statement 
that doesn’t mention the specifics. 
No, no, you give us a statement that 
mentions the investigations. 
That is the month of August. 
August is also the month where it be-
comes clear that it is not just the 
meeting anymore. It is everything. Ev-
erything is conditioned on these inves-
tigations—the relationship, the money, 
the meeting. Sondland and Holmes tes-
tify it is as simple as two plus two 
equals four. That is all. 
In 
September, 
Sondland 
says 
to 
Yermak: Everything is conditioned on 
public announcements. 
Message delivered, no ambiguity: The 
Ukrainians are told quid pro quo. 
Taylor texts: This is crazy to with-
hold aid. 
September is the month—September 
7 in particular, Trump and Sondland 
talk on the phone, and the President 
has that conversation where he says: 
No quid pro quo—except, here is the 
quid pro quo. 
Zelensky has to go to the mike, and 
what is more, he should want to do it. 
September is also the month where 
the investigations begin in Congress. 
September is the month where, after 
those investigations begin, after the 
President knows he has been caught, 
the aid is finally released. September is 
the month where Pence and Zelensky 
are on the phone and Jennifer Williams 
has classified information to share 
with you that I hope you will take a 
look at because it is relevant to these 
issues. 
That is September. 
In October, Trump admits: Yes, if it 
wasn’t 
obvious 
enough, 
he 
wants 
Ukraine to investigate his political op-
ponent. October is the month where he 
invites another nation, China, to inves-
tigate his opponent. 
This is the broad outline of the chro-
nology that we went through today. 
Tomorrow, we will go through the 
law, the Constitution, and the facts as 
they apply to article I. That is the plan 
for tomorrow. 
We have introduced the case. We 
have gone through the chronology, and 
tomorrow, we will apply the facts to 
the law as it pertains to the Presi-
dent’s abuse of power. 
Let me just conclude this evening by 
remarking again on what brought us 
here. What brought us here is that 
some courageous people came forward, 
courageous people that risked their en-
tire careers. One of the things that has 
been striking to me about that, as I 
watch 
these 
witnesses 
like 
Maria 
Yovanovitch and Ambassador Taylor 
and David Holmes and others—Dr. 
Hill—is how much these dedicated offi-
cials were willing to risk their career, 
the beginning of their career, the mid-
dle of their career, or late in their ca-
reer, when they had everything to lose, 
but people senior to them, who have 
every advantage, who sit in positions 
of power, lack that same basic commit-
ment, lack that similar basic willing-
ness to put their country first and ex-
pose wrongdoing. 
Why is it that Colonel Vindman, who 
worked for Fiona Hill, who worked for 
John Bolton and Dr. Kupperman, were 
willing to stick their neck out and an-
swer 
lawful 
subpoenas 
when 
their 
bosses wouldn’t? I don’t know that I 
can answer that question, but I just 
can tell you, I have such admiration 
for the fact they did. 
I think this is some form of cosmic 
justice that this Ambassador that was 
so ruthlessly smeared is now a hero for 
her courage. There is justice in that. 
But what would really vindicate that 
leap of faith that she took is if we show 
the same courage. They risked every-
thing—their careers—and, yes, I know 
what you are asked to decide may risk 
yours too, but if they could show the 
courage, so can we. 
I yield back.

the provisions of S. Res. 243 of the 100th
