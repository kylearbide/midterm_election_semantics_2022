PROMOTING PUERTO RICO’S 
STATEHOOD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) for 
5 minutes. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, on this date in 1917, 
Puerto Ricans became American citi-
zens. Nineteen years after coming 
under the American flag, the Jones- 
Shafroth Act established that residents 
of Puerto Rico at the time, and their 
descendants, would be citizens of the 
United States. 
This citizenship has provided us 
great opportunities for security and 
progress. As such, we have become an 
integral part of the national experi-
ence, contributing in numerous fields 
of education, politics, law, science, art, 
and business; and we have defended 
this Nation side-by-side with our fellow 
citizens from other States. 
We value our American citizenship so 
much that we included in our local 
constitution that one of our defining 
values is: 
Our Citizenship of the United States and 
the aspiration to continue enriching our 
democratic heritage individually and collec-
tively in the enjoyment of its rights and pre-
rogatives. 
In votes throughout the years, over-
whelming majorities of Puerto Ricans 
have affirmed the intention to con-
tinue being U.S. citizens. 
Yet, we have been denied that aspira-
tion, denied that enrichment of values 
of American citizenship. 
In 1898, when the U.S. Forces first 
landed in Puerto Rico, General Miles 
issued a proclamation promising: ‘‘We 
have come to . . . bring you protection 
. . . to promote your prosperity and be-
stow upon you the immunities and 
blessings of the . . . institutions of our 
government.’’ 
But instead, what happened was that 
almost right after achieving citizen-
ship, a Supreme Court decision, Balzac 
v. Porto Rico, ruled that as residents 
in an unincorporated territory, we will 
only have partially those rights. That, 
contrary to what had been the case of 
every other territory before, achieving 
American citizenship did not mean 
necessarily a road to full equality as a 
State. 
Since then, our enjoyment of rights 
shared by our fellow Americans in the 
States has been only in a limited man-
ner, as the Congress and the courts see 
fit to grant them. The promise remains 
unfulfilled. 
Unfulfilled, in spite of how 220,000 
Puerto Ricans have worn this country’s 
uniform and fought and bled for our 
Nation under the orders of a Com-
mander in Chief for whom they cannot 
vote. 
Unfulfilled, when those living in 
Puerto Rico do not have full and equal 
representation in this Congress that 
decides how they will be ruled, what 
policies will be applied. As a Rep-
resentative of almost 3.2 million Amer-
ican citizens, I am not allowed to vote 
on the passage of legislation that gov-
erns their daily lives. 
This allows Puerto Rico to be treated 
unequally under Federal laws, regula-
tions, and programs involving funding, 
levels of service, statistics, even being 
treated as if we were foreign for some 
purposes. 
But we are Americans. We are born 
as U.S. citizens, in soil under the 
American flag, and the largest number 
of citizens who are disenfranchised. 
That is why I continue to promote 
Puerto Rico’s statehood. Our people 
have already decisively voted that the 
status quo is not acceptable and chosen 
their change. We deserve, we have 
earned full exercise of the dignity, 
rights, and privileges of our American 
citizenship, including full representa-
tion and participation in the political 
process which governs our lives, which 
is only possible with statehood. 
Our American citizenship has rep-
resented 103 years of opportunities, but 
making the most of those opportuni-
ties can only happen in full equality. It 
is our right as citizens, and we have 
waited long enough.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God of the universe, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
You know the Members of this assem-
bly through and through. You know 
each personally. You know how they 
all relate to one another. You know 
them, as the American people do, as 
the 116th Congress of the United 
States. 
Lord, help them to know You. Allow 
them to come to know You even as 
they are known by You. As ultimate 
truth, enter in and make them suitable 
for Your dwelling within, so that their 
constituents might place trust in them 
as their representatives. 
May their service continue faithfully, 
for they were selected; they were elect-
ed by their voters back home, and 
called by You to selfless service. 
Bless them and us all this day, and 
may all that is done be for Your great-
er honor and glory. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. ROSE) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. ROSE of New York led the

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

CONGRATULATING IRISH 
DIASPORA CENTER 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Irish Dias-
pora Center on opening its new office 
in my district. 
I had the opportunity to join sup-
porters of the center this weekend at 
its new cultural hub in Havertown, 
where I had the pleasure of sharing 
food and swapping stories with fellow 
Irish Americans. 
For decades, this organization has 
supported and celebrated the vibrant 
Irish community in the Philadelphia 
region with passport and citizenship 
services, senior outreach, youth pro-
grams, genealogy services, and edu-
cational and cultural events. 
People of Irish descent have histori-
cally formed the largest ethnic group 
in my district, and to this day, we 
proudly continue to welcome new Irish 
American citizens. With almost a quar-
ter of the population claiming Irish 
heritage, Delaware County is even 
sometimes referred to as the 33rd coun-
ty of Ireland. 
I look forward to supporting and 
celebrating our Irish neighbors both at 
home and abroad as I work with Chair-
man NEAL and the Friends of Ireland 
Caucus to protect the integrity of the 
Good Friday Agreement and maintain 
peace and prosperity in Ireland. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SALLY 
KABEL 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Sally 
Kabel, a young girl from Bay Ridge, 
Brooklyn, who, despite battling leu-
kemia for most of her life, did so brave-
ly and with a love of life that earned 
her the nickname ‘‘Sweet Sally Sun-
shine.’’ 
Sally was adored, not just by her 
family, but by the entire Bay Ridge 
community, which rallied behind her. 
Everyone came together to support her 
family, whether it was bringing meals, 
raising money, or just giving them 
hugs on the street. 
With that support, Sally was able to 
beat cancer, but the treatments so 
weakened her body that she passed 
away in September 2018, just a week 
after her sixth birthday. 
Although her time with us was far 
too short, she filled those 6 years with 
a lifetime of joy. 
Now, her parents, Matthew and Ni-
cole, are helping other families under-
going the same struggle. They are ad-
vocating for childhood cancer aware-
ness, with the hope that more research 
will lead to more humane and effective 
treatments for children. 
Sally was truly the peacemaker of 
Bay Ridge, bringing out the best in all 
of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me today in honoring her memory.

IMPROVING 
FHA 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
SMALL 
DOLLAR 
MORTGAGES 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5931) to require a review of 
the effects of FHA mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products on 
small-dollar mortgage lending, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5931 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving 
FHA Support for Small Dollar Mortgages 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORT-
GAGE PRACTICES. 
(a) CONGRESSIONAL
FINDINGS.—The Con-
gress finds that— 
(1) affordable homeownership opportunities 
are being hindered due to the lack of financ-
ing available for home purchases under 
$70,000; 
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small- 
dollar mortgage loan applications in 2017 
were denied by lenders at double the rate of 
denial for large mortgage loans, and this dif-
ference in denial rates cannot be fully ex-
plained by differences in the applicants’ 
credit profiles; 
(3) according to data compiled by Attom 
Data solutions, small-dollar mortgage origi-
nations have decreased 38 percent since 2009,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1427 
March 2, 2020 
while there has been a 65 percent increase in 
origination of mortgages for more than 
$150,000; 
(4) the FHA’s mission is to serve credit-
worthy borrowers who are underserved and, 
according to the Urban Institute, the FHA 
serves 24 percent of the overall market, but 
only 19 percent of the small-dollar mortgage 
market; and 
(5) the causes behind these variations are 
not fully understood, but merit study that 
could assist in furthering the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s mission, 
including meeting the housing needs of bor-
rowers the program is designed to serve and 
reducing barriers to homeownership, while 
protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mort-
gage Insurance Fund. 
(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development shall conduct a review of 
its FHA single-family mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products to identify 
any barriers or impediments to supporting, 
facilitating, and making available mortgage 
insurance for mortgages having an original 
principal obligation of $70,000 or less. Not 
later than the expiration of the 12-month pe-
riod beginning on the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a re-
port to the Congress describing the findings 
of such review and the actions that the Sec-
retary will take, without adversely affecting 
the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insur-
ance Fund, to remove such barriers and im-
pediments to providing mortgage insurance 
for such mortgages. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Guam. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and insert ex-
traneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, when it comes to pro-
moting access to homeownership, much 
of the focus tends to be on how high 
housing prices are pricing borrowers 
out of many communities. 
But the landscape of homeownership 
opportunities is varied, and for many 
communities, the lack of access to tra-
ditional mortgage financing for small 
dollar mortgages continues to be a 
challenge. Specifically, I am talking 
about mortgages that are $70,000 or 
less. 
For many rural communities and 
communities that are struggling to 
overcome the impacts of the fore-
closure crisis, there are lower value 
homes that would otherwise be ideal 
homeownership opportunities for first- 
time home buyers and working-class 
families, but the lack of available tra-
ditional financing acts as a barrier to 
those opportunities. 
Data from the Urban Institute shows 
that these small dollar mortgages are 
denied by lenders at double the rate 
compared to larger loans, and this 
trend cannot be explained away by dif-
ferences in the creditworthiness of ap-
plicants. In actuality, lenders don’t 
make as much money originating these 
smaller mortgage loans, resulting in a 
reluctance to make them. 
The Federal Housing Administration 
was designed to support underserved 
markets and would be instrumental in 
supporting more small dollar mortgage 
lending, but the data shows that the 
FHA is actually disproportionately 
failing to serve this market. 
H.R. 5931 would require the FHA to 
identify barriers to better serving the 
small dollar mortgage market and to 
come up with a plan to reduce those 
barriers, a public service long overdue 
for rural America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5931, the Improving FHA Support for 
Small Dollar Mortgages Act. 
Studies suggest that borrowers of 
small dollar mortgages, those amounts 
under $70,000, may be disproportion-
ately denied when compared to loans of 
higher amounts, even when the credit 
profiles of the borrowers are similar. 
Specifically, the Urban Institute re-
ports that, in 2015, roughly 25 percent 
of homes purchased for $70,000 or less 
were financed with a mortgage com-
pared to 80 percent of houses worth be-
tween $70,000 and $150,000. 
If there is such a disproportionate 
amount of denials, this could be an 
issue for families in my district and 
many others who are trying to buy a 
first home, particularly in our rural 
communities across our country. 
H.R. 5931 is a bipartisan bill spon-
sored by Representative CLAY of Mis-
souri and Representative STIVERS of 
Ohio and was reported to the House by 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee last week. This bill seeks to 
better understand what is happening in 
small dollar mortgage lending. 
This bill asks the fundamental ques-
tion: Are there borrowers who other-
wise qualify for a mortgage who are 
being left out of the market as an unin-
tended consequence of FHA’s own rules 
and regulations? 
After all, the FHA mission is to serve 
creditworthy borrowers without bias, 
no matter what the loan size is. If FHA 
can identify how its own regulations 
are hurting borrowers’ access to credit 
and remedy the problem without af-
fecting the health of the Mutual Mort-
gage Insurance Fund, then they should 
do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my friends, Mr. CLAY and Mr. STIVERS, 
for bringing this issue to our attention 
and for their work on this bill. I would 
like to take the opportunity to thank 
my friend from Guam for managing 
this bill this afternoon. 
H.R. 5931 is a positive example of 
Congress identifying a problem and 
working together to understand the 
causes and to identify a reasonable so-
lution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLAY), the chairman of the Housing, 
Community Development and Insur-
ance Subcommittee and the sponsor of 
this legislation. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, first, let me 
thank my colleague from Guam for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5931, the Improving FHA Support for 
Small Dollar Mortgages Act of 2020. 
I want to start off by thanking my 
Financial 
Services 
Committee 
col-
league, 
Congressman 
STIVERS
from 
Ohio, for working with my staff and me 
to craft a bill that will ultimately try 
to help close the affordable housing 
gap, and I look forward to working 
with him on other legislation and pol-
icy going forward. 
H.R. 5931, the Clay-Stivers Improving 
FHA Support for Small Dollar Mort-
gages Act of 2020, would require the 
FHA to conduct a review of its policy 
to identify any barriers to supporting 
mortgages under $70,000, or small dol-
lar mortgages, and submit a report to 
Congress within a year with a plan for 
removing such barriers. 
In a recent report, the Urban Insti-
tute found that, despite having similar 
performance indicators, credit profiles, 
loan-to-value ratios, and lower debt-to- 
income ratios, the financing options to 
purchase, renovate, or refinance homes 
valued at or under $70,000 remain lim-
ited compared to mortgages between 
$70,000 and $150,000—and many of those 
homes are in our State of Missouri. 
Mr. Speaker, the Urban Institute re-
port further revealed that FHA is dis-
proportionately failing to serve this 
market, despite its mission to serve 
underserved 
borrowers. 
Specifically, 
the report found that FHA serves 24 
percent of the overall market but only 
19 percent of the small dollar mortgage 
market. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bipartisan study to identify 
any barriers to supporting these small 
dollar mortgages and report to Con-
gress within a year a plan for removing 
such barriers to financing for credit-
worthy borrowers. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
H.R. 5931, as I say, is a good example of 
both sides in this House working to-
gether for a worthy purpose. I support 
the bill. I urge all my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleagues, Mr. CLAY and Mr. STIV-
ERS, for their partnership on this im-
portant bill, and my colleague, Mr. 
HILL, for his work with me today as we 
seek to improve access to affordable 
homeownership.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Guam. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Representative DEAN for her leadership 
on H.R. 5003 and the relief that it will 
provide to our servicemembers. 
At a full Financial Services Com-
mittee hearing in September of last 
year, we heard testimony about the 
harmful impact of predatory debt col-
lection practices, including negative 
impacts on the servicemembers pro-
tecting our country. 
We know this impact is significant, 
given that two out of every five serv-
icemember complaints submitted to 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau are about predatory debt collec-
tion practices. 
Some of the complaints include inap-
propriate threats of punishment under 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 
threats to the rank and security clear-
ance of the servicemember, and even 
reports of debt collectors inappropri-
ately contacting the commanding offi-
cer of the debt holder. 
It is a disgrace that people serving in 
the military are being threatened and 
intimidated when they are serving our 
country. The impact of these abusive 
collection practices is severe, as serv-
icemembers have reported increased 
stress and hardship as a result of pred-
atory debt collectors. 
These unfair and unnecessary prac-
tices against people putting their lives 
on the line for this country must end, 
which is why the National Military 
Family 
Association; 
Veterans 
Edu-
cation Success; and Retired Army 
Colonel Paul Kantwill, the former 
CFPB Assistant Director for Service-
member Affairs, all support the bill. 
Democrats and Republicans agree 
that Congress should put a halt to 
these abusive practices, and this bill 
does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, thanks to the work of 
my colleagues, Representative DEAN, 
Chairwoman WATERS, Ranking Member 
MCHENRY, and colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle from the Financial Services 
and the House Armed Services Com-
mittees, we were able to collaborate on 
the issues and pass this bill out of our 
committee with unanimous support in 
November of last year. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5003. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. DEAN) for introducing 
this legislation. 
Our servicemembers put their lives 
on the line for us every day. The last 
thing we want is that, when they are 
serving, they are to be distracted. 
H.R. 5003 prohibits debt collectors 
from using threats against the service-
member’s rank or security clearance or 
threats of prosecution under the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice. Not only 
are such practices unfair, they increase 
the risk of harm to the servicemem-
ber’s military readiness. 
During the committee markup of 
H.R. 5003, Republicans expressed con-
cerns that there were too many unan-
swered questions about how this bill 
could impact military readiness. 
The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIV-
ERS) offered an amendment to direct 
the Comptroller General of the United 
States to conduct a study on the im-
pact of this bill and what its impact is 
on the timeliness with which service-
members are informed about debts and 
collection, as well as on military readi-
ness and national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill’s spon-
sor and Chair WATERS in accepting Mr. 
STIVERS’ constructive addition. 
b 1715 
This bill is a commonsense approach 
to ensure that Congress considers the 
connection between national security 
and the protection of servicemembers 
from unfair practices. 
Mr. Speaker, it is very important 
today that we thank the Department of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1429 
March 2, 2020 
Defense and the House Armed Services 
Committee for their support and anal-
ysis in making this a quality measure 
for us to consider. 
All Americans deserve to be treated 
with dignity and respect when faced 
with repaying a debt. This is especially 
true for our servicemembers who fight 
for our freedoms every day. 
This bill will provide important safe-
guards, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN), the sponsor of this impor-
tant legislation. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
good gentleman from Guam for yield-
ing. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5003, the Fair 
Debt Collection Practices for Service-
members Act. 
Every day we are reminded of the sig-
nificant sacrifices our troops make to 
protect us, and as Members of Congress 
we have a responsibility to protect 
those who protect us. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices 
for Servicemembers Act works to live 
up to this responsibility by addressing 
abusive debt collection practices spe-
cifically targeting servicemembers. 
According to the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, approximately 40 
percent of the complaints filed by serv-
icemembers concern debt collection, as 
compared to 26 percent by nonservice-
members. These debt collection prac-
tices are manipulative and have nega-
tive career implications for soldiers 
and their families. 
Egregious practices include: Con-
tacting the servicemembers’ chain of 
command in order to extract payment, 
threatening punishment through the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice, 
threatening rank reduction, or threat-
ening to revoke a soldier’s security 
clearances. 
Unfortunately, these practices do not 
stop with the servicemember. Some 
debt collectors also target military 
spouses, unfairly burdening our mili-
tary families who sacrifice so much for 
us. 
These tactics are egregious and must 
stop. Our servicemen and -women make 
extraordinary sacrifices for all of us. 
The last thing they need is harassment 
from debt collectors who take advan-
tage of their service, which is why I am 
pleased to rise in support of this bill 
and to have had the chance to work 
with the entire Financial Services 
Committee, the chair, the ranking 
member, and the members. 
Specifically, my bill amends the Fair 
Debt Collection Practices Act and pro-
hibits a debt collector from commu-
nicating with a servicemember’s chain 
of command or department for the pur-
pose of threatening to have their rank 
reduced or threatening to revoke secu-
rity clearance. 
This legislation will help ensure that 
our military families are not unneces-
sarily targeted for their service to our 
country and shield them from bad prac-
tices. I am in awe of our servicemem-
bers’ spirit of service. We must do our 
part to service them. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive STIVERS and Representative DA-
VIDSON, a fellow member of the Finan-
cial Services Committee and an Army 
veteran with years of service, for co-
sponsoring and supporting this bill. I 
urge all Members to support it. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I think that was an excellent descrip-
tion of why this bill is needed. We 
honor the 1 percent of Americans that 
go out, put on the uniform, and serve 
the other 99 percent of Americans, 
those who work for our freedoms every 
day around the world, 24/7. This is one 
of the least things we can do to make 
servicemembers’ lives and the lives of 
those military families at the margin 
better. 
I thank my friends for bringing this 
bill. I appreciate its sponsor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank Representative DEAN, Chair-
woman WATERS, and my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for their good 
work and collaboration on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5003, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-

which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I very much support 
H.R. 5932, the Ensuring Chinese Debt 
Transparency Act of 2020, which seeks 
to reinforce U.S. policy at the World 
Bank, 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund, and the regional development 
banks to press for disclosure of the 
amount and terms of China’s bilateral 
lending operations abroad. 
According to the International Mone-
tary Fund, opaque loans from China’s 
many lending institutions, especially 
those associated with China’s Belt and 
Road Initiative are not only putting 
many emerging market and developing 
countries at risk of debt distress, but 
also complicate the IMF’s ability to

monitor domestic, regional, and global 
financial risks associated with this 
debt. 
While the ability to accurately iden-
tify the amount and terms of Chinese 
lending in developing countries is es-
sential to better debt risk manage-
ment, surveillance work, and asset risk 
pricing, it is important to understand 
that greater transparency itself is only 
a starting point. 
In order to help low-income, emerg-
ing market, and fragile and conflict-af-
fected states meet development goals 
while maintaining debt sustainability, 
the United States should be increasing 
its commitments to the multilateral 
development banks to offer these coun-
tries better options than China does, to 
provide 
additional 
financing 
on 
concessional terms of which China does 
very little. 
Let me add that one argument for 
China’s ongoing borrowing from the 
World Bank is that it allows a broader 
public global good to be imported into 
the Chinese system, things like inter-
national environmental and societal 
standards, high standards of trans-
parency and open procurement proc-
esses, strong governance programs, and 
respect for the importance of global 
economic cooperation. 
However, there is very little evidence 
that World Bank lending to China has 
had any such effect on Chinese behav-
ior with respect to its own develop-
ment financing abroad, and this is a se-
rious problem. 
H.R. 5932 helps us to address this 
problem. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the legislation, H.R. 5932, which I in-
troduced recently, and I was fortunate 
to have the Speaker’s assistance on 
this, my friend from Missouri, Mr. 
CLEAVER, in designing this legislation. 
It is just one issue that relates to a 
complex set of issues around China’s 
access to the World Bank and China’s 
engagement in the world as a creditor. 
But H.R. 5932, Ensuring Chinese Debt 
Transparency Act, would require the 
Secretary of the Treasury to instruct 
the U.S. executive director at each of 
the international financial institutions 
that it is U.S. policy to ensure greater 
transparency in Chinese Government 
lending to countries that are also bene-
ficiaries of those international finan-
cial institutions. 
Specifically, this bill would require 
the Secretary to report annually to 
Congress on the progress in advancing 
this policy, and secondly, lending to 
foreign countries by entities owned or 
controlled by the Chinese Government. 
As we know, the international finan-
cial institutions include the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, the IMF, the 
World Bank, and the regional develop-
ment banks. The IMF lends to foreign 
countries in order to resolve balance- 
of-payments crises, while the develop-
ment banks finance projects with the 
long-term aim of alleviating poverty. 
With the growth of China’s global 
presence, there is concern that the de-
veloping nations that borrow from Bei-
jing will become overburdened, forcing 
them to be rescued by the IMF or com-
plicating the development banks’ abil-
ity to properly underwrite loans for 
new projects. 
Specifically, the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative is of significant concern. The 
Chinese Belt and Road Initiative is a 
global development strategy adopted 
by the Chinese Government in 2013. It 
involves 
infrastructure 
development 
and investments in nearly 70 countries 
and 
international 
organizations 
in 
Asia, Europe, and in Africa. 
To date, according to Morgan Stan-
ley’s estimates, the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative has committed more than $200 
billion with estimates that China may 
invest up to $1.3 trillion by 2027. Other 
estimates have the current number 
closer to $400 billion. Either number 
dwarfs the post-World War II Marshall 
Plan, which, measured in today’s dol-
lars, would be $130 billion. 
However, unlike the Marshall Plan, 
Belt and Road Initiative financing can 
make underwriting assistance difficult 
or even unworkable for developing 
countries as the initiative has opaque 
financing terms. China simply doesn’t 
report on this lending in any system-
atic way, and there is no evidence that 
China is adopting international trans-
parency standards from the multilat-
eral development banks or engages in 
best practices to prevent debt traps, 
corruption, or poor construction out-
comes. 
China needs to be held accountable to 
ensure that it is not taking advantage 
of vulnerable economies in these coun-
tries. In my view, the World Bank and 
the IMF must know the terms and con-
ditions of opaque Chinese lending, what 
those entail, when they are considering 
a sovereign loan to a country that goes 
to the World Bank or the IMF for as-
sistance. 
On a trip to the Republic of Congo 
back in 2017, I witnessed this firsthand 
when I saw the burdens and impact of 
Chinese lending on that oil-based econ-
omy. Now, the Republic of Congo finds 
itself in the hands of the IMF in nego-
tiating with them for a payments loan. 
This legislation will contribute to 
that overall accountability by seeking 
to secure greater transparency con-
sistent with the principles of the Paris 
Club, a group of global creditors, in-
cluding the United States, who find 
workable solutions for nations cur-
rently in debt. 
In theory, many of the underlying 
policies in this legislation should al-
ready be practiced; however, due to po-
litical 
insensitivities, 
inertia, 
and 
other concerns, that doesn’t always 
happen. This legislation will under-
score the United States’ leadership and 
help develop a global multilateral ef-
fort to ensure more scrutiny for China. 
As China becomes a major creditor na-
tion, it should be held to a high stand-
ard. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In conclusion, I would say that this is 
the way to build a partnership between 
the multilateral countries of the world 
that support the World Bank and the 
IMF and have China have more scru-
tiny on their opaque terms and condi-
tions, which in turn should allow bet-
ter outcomes for our developing na-
tions around the world, less chance of 
falling into a debt trap. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. I thank my 
friend from Missouri for his assistance 
and my friend from Guam for man-
aging the bill. I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The fact that China continues to bor-
row from the World Bank affords us an 
opportunity to expect much more from 
China in return, including an insist-
ence on transparency in China’s bilat-
eral financing operations, greater ad-
herence by China to anticorruption and 
export credit international standards, 
and finding coordinated and sustain-
able solutions to countries experi-
encing balance of payment difficulties. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, which underscores that far 
greater transparency is the first essen-
tial step China must take if it is to be 
a responsible member of the global fi-
nancial community. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Guam. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 
4351, the Yes In My Backyard Act. This 
bill would encourage localities to re-
sponsibly reduce barriers to housing 
development by requiring Community 
Development Block Grant, CDBG, re-
cipients to track and report on the im-
plementation of certain land use poli-
cies that promote housing develop-
ment. 
The United States is in the midst of 
an affordable housing crisis. According 
to the National Low Income Housing 
Coalition, the U.S. has a shortage of 7 
million rental homes that are afford-
able and available to extremely low-in-
come renters. 
The research organization Up for 
Growth estimates that, from 2000 to 
2015, the country underproduced hous-
ing by 7.3 million units. This under-
production is, in many ways, driven by 
land use policies that create artificial 
barriers to much-needed housing. 
This bill will also help shine a light 
on potentially discriminatory land use 
policies that unnecessarily prevent af-
fordable housing development in cer-
tain neighborhoods. 
It is clear, based on the broad base of 
industry and advocate support for this 
bill, as well as the bipartisan support, 
that there is substantial agreement on 
the need to facilitate more affordable 
housing production across the country 
as well as the need to responsibly re-
duce barriers to affordable housing pro-
duction. 
H.R. 4351, the Yes In My Backyard 
Act, represents a step in the right di-
rection as we seek to address the af-
fordable housing challenges that our 
country faces. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
HECK for introducing this timely legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4351. This bi-
partisan legislation would require lo-
calities to analyze the artificial bar-
riers that local zoning requirements 
create that hinder the production of af-
fordable housing. 
Republicans agree with our friends 
across the aisle that the cost of local 
zoning rules and regulations at all lev-
els of government often contribute to 
the high cost of housing. In fact, ac-
cording to the National Association of 
Home Builders and the National Multi-
family Housing Council, up to 30 per-
cent of the cost of building each unit of 
housing can be attributed to these bar-
riers. 
The impact of local zoning and regu-
latory barriers is particularly apparent 
in high-cost areas, particularly on the 
East and West Coasts of this land, 
where zoning and regulatory costs can 
be upward of 50 percent of a total 
project’s cost before it even breaks 
ground. 
Mr. Daryl Carter, founder, chairman, 
and CEO of Avanath Capital Manage-
ment, outlined some of these zoning 
barriers on behalf of the National Mul-
tifamily Housing Council when he tes-
tified before the Financial Services 
Committee in April 2019. Examples in-
clude onerous and extended entitle-
ment requirements, excessive impact 
and 
linkage 
fees, 
business 
license 
taxes, assessment and inspection fees, 
outdated minimum parking require-
ments, and lengthy environmental site 
assessments. 
These costs prevent sufficient num-
bers of new housing units from being 
built to satisfy demand, driving up 
housing prices and making housing 
even more unaffordable. 
It is important to reiterate that this 
bill doesn’t punish communities or in-
sert the Federal Government into any 
local zoning matters. All it does is re-
quests localities that receive Federal 
community development funds to re-
port on the policies that they have in 
place. 
This legislation is a good first step in 
assisting Congress to better understand 
these local barriers to constructing 
new affordable housing. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1432 
March 2, 2020 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Washington 
(Mr. HECK), the sponsor of this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I do, in fact, 
rise in support of H.R. 4351, the Yes In 
My Backyard, or YIMBY, Act. I thank 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) as well as the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for bringing this 
to the floor. 
Our Nation is, in fact, suffering from 
a severe national housing crisis, a word 
that is overused too much but, in fact, 
applies to the situation. 
We are indeed missing millions of 
homes to meet qualified and eligible 
demand in this country. The reference 
earlier was to 7.3 million. Estimates 
range from 7 to 10 million homes. 
In my home State alone, to put that 
in perspective, Washington State, we 
are underproduced by 200,000 homes. 
The 
implications 
of 
not 
having 
enough homes, of a supply problem, are 
grave, because housing, it turns out, is 
an ecosystem. What we see now is this 
entire ecosystem is under stress, and as 
a consequence, the cost of shelter is 
going up for everyone. 
From homeowners to renters, mar-
ket-rate 
to 
affordable 
homes, 
and 
urban to suburban and rural areas, this 
housing crisis has hit everyone. 
One place where it is particularly 
acute is the production of starter 
homes. Stop and think about what that 
does to the ecosystem. If we are not 
building starter homes because of some 
of the fees, as an example, or regula-
tions that my friend from Arkansas al-
luded to, that means that people who 
are renting can’t quite get that first 
rung on the ladder of homeownership. 
It also means that the boomers who are 
seeking to downsize can’t find homes 
that they can purchase. 
What is the implication of that? If 
there are no starter homes, more peo-
ple stay renting. If more people stay 
renting, occupancies go up. If occupan-
cies go up, rents go up. 
It is pure supply and demand. More 
people become rent-burdened, and, yes, 
in fact, this is a contributory cause of 
increased homelessness even in Amer-
ica. 
How severe is this? Little known 
fact, but a fact nonetheless: In the last 
15 years, the single largest increase in 
household budgets, counterintuitively, 
is not healthcare, not postsecondary 
education, but it is housing. 
I have been saying for years that we 
need to encourage the construction of 
more homes that Americans can afford. 
We need to build more homes of all 
types and sizes for all of our neighbors. 
Now, affordable housing advocates, 
economists, 
builders, 
lenders, 
and 
countless others have come together to 
try to begin to solve this problem, now 
a crisis, and there are a few common 
themes beginning to emerge from their 
research. 
One of these common themes is that 
certain zoning and land use policies are 
negatively impacting construction and 
affordable housing supply. Local gov-
ernments regulate zoning and land use 
policy, and we shouldn’t be doing that 
here. That is not what this bill is 
about. 
The fact of the matter is, commu-
nities experience different barriers to 
housing. One size doesn’t fit all, so we 
shouldn’t be getting into that business. 
But the impact of zoning and land use 
policies on housing are significant. As 
certain regulations have increased, 
they have resulted in fewer homes and 
unaffordable housing cost increases for 
everyone, the hardest hit being low-in-
come people. 
Here is another fact. There is not a 
single county in the United States of 
America where somebody working full 
time at a minimum wage job can af-
ford, according to Federal standards, a 
two-bedroom unit—not a single county 
in all of America. 
That is why I argue that we must 
have a better understanding of the im-
pacts of these policies. Sunlight is, 
after all, the best disinfectant. 
Under the YIMBY Act, local govern-
ments receiving Federal housing funds 
through the Community Development 
Block Grant program, or CDBG, would 
report on whether they have enacted 
policies to reduce regulations that af-
fect affordable housing supply. 
Let’s be clear. There is nothing in 
this bill that will deny municipalities 
CDBG—nothing. Rather, the bill seeks 
simple transparency for these deci-
sions. It encourages localities to elimi-
nate housing barriers. 
I introduced the YIMBY Act with my 
friend, Congressman HOLLINGSWORTH 
from Indiana, and it did, in fact, pass 
out of the committee unopposed. But it 
is not only bipartisan. It enjoys an in-
credible spectrum of support among ex-
ternal stakeholders. 
I am not going to bore you with all 18 
organizations, but everybody from the 
American 
Planning 
Association, 
to 
Habitat for Humanity, to the Mortgage 
Bankers Association all back this bill 
because it is time to take this step. 
Solving the housing crisis is going to 
require the work and collaboration of 
all levels of government. Everybody 
has a hand on the oar here, local, 
State, and Federal governments. This 
is no longer something that elected of-
ficials at any level can ignore, and that 
includes us. 
We have a national housing crisis, 
one that is brought on in part by zon-
ing and land use policies. This YIMBY 
Act is a crucial first step to addressing 
these policies in order to bring down 
housing costs. 
Mr. Speaker, I submit it to the body 
for its favorable consideration, and I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
(Mr. HILL), the gentleman from Guam 
(Mr. SAN NICOLAS), and the chair of the 
committee as well for their work bring-
ing this to the floor today. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my 
thanks to Congressman HECK and Con-
gressman 
HOLLINGSWORTH
for 
their 
leadership on this. It really draws at-
tention to this issue. It is an issue that 
comes up before our committee so fre-
quently, how we lower that cost of 
housing. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend 
from 
Washington 
also 
emphasizing 
first-time home buyers and that start-
er home buyer. It is so important. 
I am blessed in greater Little Rock 
to live in a place that is still pretty af-
fordable, by national standards, to get 
that first home and get started in the 
right way. 
But I think, to look at it on a na-
tional basis, I really thank my friend 
from Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to say, though, 
he is such a young and dynamic person, 
I have never thought of him as a boom-
er. This Congress will be a weaker 
place, a less happy place, because 
DENNY HECK has decided to step down 
and return to hearth and home and an-
other way after this Congress. I want 
to say here before his friends and our 
colleagues what a privilege it has been 
to serve with him for the past 5 years. 
I thank him for the leadership on 
this bill. I thank my friend from Guam 
for managing this effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I, 
too, would like to thank Mr. HECK and 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH for their leader-
ship on this important bipartisan bill, 
as well as Mr. HILL for managing this 
on the floor with me. 
This bill is a constructive next step 
to help reduce the barriers to pro-
ducing affordable housing, and that is 
something that every American can 
get behind. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CLAY). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Guam 
(Mr. SAN NICOLAS) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
4351, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

stitutions.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

WISHING DAVID PEREZ A HAPPY 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to wish a happy 100th birthday to 
private first-class David Perez. 
In 1931, David’s immigrant parents 
and their 14 kids moved to the Salad 
Bowl of the World in Salinas, Cali-
fornia to work in agriculture and raise 
a family. 
During World War II, David and two 
of his brothers were drafted to fight for 
our country. As a combat medic, Pri-
vate Perez shipped out to the Pacific 
theater. Serving with the 27th Infantry 
Division, he fought hard, saved many 
lives, and even was injured by enemy 
fire. Private Perez received many med-
als for his service, including the Bronze 
Star for his bravery in the Battle of 
Saipan where he evacuated and tended 
to four of his wounded comrades. 
After the military, David returned to 
Salinas, raised a family and was a 
member of the Elks Lodge, American 
Legion Post 31, and in 2019 he was cho-
sen to be the grand marshal of the Sali-
nas Veteran’s Day parade. 
For all that he has done in his long 
life, David will be the first to tell you, 
though, his proudest moments are 
being with his wife Lillian, his two 
daughters, 
Celia 
and 
Felicia, 
five 
grandchildren, and five great grand-
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy 100th to 
David and thank him for showing our 
community and our country what it 
means to be a part of the Greatest Gen-
eration and what it takes to fulfill an 
American Dream. Happy birthday.

CELEBRATING SMOKEY BEAR’S 
75TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the 75th birthday of Smokey Bear, one 
of American culture’s most recogniz-
able icons. 
For 75 years, Smokey Bear has im-
plored us time and time again to be

H1435 
March 2, 2020 
mindful while spending time in the 
great outdoors and to promote forest 
health with his famous slogan, ‘‘Only 
you can prevent forest fires.’’ 
Smokey has taught countless indi-
viduals both young and old about the 
importance of personal responsibility 
for protecting the environment and our 
natural resources. 
On 
Smokey’s 
75th 
birthday, 
we 
should also remember that the best 
way to prevent a forest fire is through 
a well-managed forest. Proper forest 
management is not only critical to the 
health and strength of the forest indus-
try but essential for a healthy environ-
ment and economy of the rural area, as 
well. 
I think we can all agree that Smokey 
looks pretty good for 75 and is working 
as hard as ever to promote responsible 
forest stewardship. Here is to 75 more 
years of preventing forest fires.

CONGRESS MUST ACT QUICKLY 
REGARDING THE CORONAVIRUS 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, we are al-
ready paying the price for the elimi-
nation by President Trump and the Re-
publican Congress in 2018 of both the 
office and the emergency funding that 
President Obama created to address 
outbreaks like the coronavirus we are 
now experiencing. 
Starting on empty, Trump’s request 
for $2.8 billion in emergency funding is 
not even in the ballpark of what ex-
perts say is needed. Already more than 
100 cases have been reported nation-
wide. A vaccine will probably not be 
available for at least a year, yet 11 
States are already reporting cases of 
the virus. 
The World Health Organization says 
the coronavirus can perhaps be con-
tained, but, ‘‘the window of oppor-
tunity is narrowing.’’ It will be up to 
us in this House to act quickly this 
week and for the Republican Senate to 
follow suit.

RECOGNIZING ADVANCED 
INNOVATIVE IT SOLUTIONS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Advanced, 
Innovative IT Solutions for its accept-
ance into the National Center for Vet-
eran Institute for Procurement. 
Located in Ludowici, in the First 
Congressional District of Georgia, Ad-
vanced, Innovative IT Solutions strives 
to eliminate the high cost of tech-
nology for government agencies by pro-
viding them with assistance in IT 
strategy planning, program manage-
ment, and cybersecurity. 
With its 15 years of experience, the 
company has earned an exceptional 
reputation throughout the southeast. 
Now, with its acceptance into the Na-
tional Center for Veteran Institute for 
Procurement, it is finally gaining the 
nationwide reputation that it deserves. 
Acceptance to the institute is highly 
competitive, and it includes a 3-day 
certification 
program 
for 
veteran- 
owned businesses to increase their abil-
ity to win government contracts. 
Graduates from this program in-
crease their revenue on average by 51 
percent within the first year of gradua-
tion. 
I am so proud Advanced, Innovative 
IT Solutions is participating in this 
program. Congratulations, and keep up 
the good work.

CALIFORNIA HIGH-COST RAIL IS A 
TERRIBLE IDEA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, author-
izing more money for California’s high- 
speed rail—I call it high-cost rail—is a 
terrible idea. 
It seems that my House colleagues 
have quickly forgotten how much of a 
disaster this project has been. 
This was sold to the voters in 2008 as 
a $33-billion project. When we finally 
got the truth out of them—this is a 
couple of years later—it tripled to $100 
billion. Then, they went back and re-
vised and said: Well, we will just 
downsize it a bit and make it about $65 
billion. 
It has since ballooned back to $100 
billion and more. It will probably be 
maybe almost double that by the time 
it actually gets done 30 years from 
now. 
It has been a boondoggle since day 
one. 
The Trump administration, thank-
fully, canceled just under a $1 billion 
grant that could have left Congress and 
D.C. to go toward that project. Instead, 
let’s put it toward something people 
can actually use, like our highways 
and our bridges, where we already have 
a lot of traffic that we have to deal 
with. 
Regular people can access that. They 
will never be able to afford a high- 
speed rail ticket at $300 a head to go 
from San Francisco to L.A., if it actu-
ally is ever completed from San Fran-
cisco to L.A. Right now, it is just going 
within the central part of the State, 
staying between walnut orchards and 
hayfields. 
It is really a crazy project. We 
shouldn’t send another dollar from D.C. 
toward that but claw back the dollars 
that have already been wasted because 
they haven’t upheld the contract to the 
voters who voted in this thing several 
years ago. 
f 
ABUNDANT LIFE CHURCH 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this 
past Saturday, I had the absolute 
pleasure of attending the first Legacy 
Recognition Award Luncheon at Abun-
dant Life Worship Center Church with 
Bishop John R. Gandy. 
They honored five individuals and 
their families whose commitment to 
south Jersey is undeniable: the Fann 
family, Pastor Loretta Farmer, Suf-
fragan Bishop Otis Grayson, the Wait-
ers 
family, 
and 
Apostle 
Luke 
Witherspoon. 
Thank you for your amazing work. 
I would also like to recognize Bishop 
John R. Gandy for his commitment and 
his leadership at Abundant Life. Bishop 
Gandy with his wife, Patricia, have im-
pacted so many lives in south Jersey 
and beyond. 
Abundant Life is a loving church and 
helps lives to be transformed through 
its threefold purpose to evangelize, 
edify, and equip the whole man, the 
whole person—spirit, soul, and body— 
to lead a joyous, abundant, and vic-
torious Christian life. 
Thank you, Bishop Gandy, your fam-
ily, and those who we recognized this 
past week. You truly are doing God’s 
work in our community, and may God 
bless you.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE (at the request of 
Mr. HOYER) for today and March 3 on 
account of official business in district.

ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I move 
that the House do now adjourn. 
The motion was agreed to; accord-
ingly (at 7 o’clock and 18 minutes 
p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until tomorrow, Tues-
day, March 3, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morn-
ing-hour debate.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO 
LEGISLATION 
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As- 
You Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YARMUTH 
hererby submits, prior to the vote on 
passage, for printing in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 5003, the Fair

S1239 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MARCH 2, 2020 
No. 41 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our refuge and strength, 
You reminded us in Romans 8:26 that 
we do not even know how we should 
pray or for what we should pray. You 
then promised that if we request it, 
Your Holy Spirit will pray for us with 
groaning that cannot be expressed in 
words. We claim that promise that 
Your Spirit will pray for us. 
Lord, guide our Senators through the 
power of this celestial intercession. In-
spire our lawmakers to earnestly seek 
to fulfill Your purposes. Enable them 
to find unity with each other because 
of their experiential relationship with 
Your intervening love. 
We pray in Your marvelous Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
ADVANCED GEOTHERMAL INNOVA-
TION LEADERSHIP ACT OF 2019— 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to S. 2657, which the clerk will 
report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to S. 2657, a bill to sup-
port innovation in advanced geothermal re-
search and development, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ANTI-DAIRY ACTIVISM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our 
U.S. dairy farmers have had a tough 
decade. Margins are thinner than ever, 
and new milk substitutes can be found 
in every grocery store. While dairy 
farmers scored a major victory in the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement with 
increased market access to Canada, 
there is a scary new trend that is very 
disturbing. 
Hollywood jokers have taken a stand 
against raising cows with the so-called 
hashtag ‘‘mootoo’’ movement. This is 
udderly 
irresponsible. 
U.S. 
dairies 
produce the highest quality milk and 
cheese in the world under the highest 
standards of care. Drink and eat dairy 
products. It is good for you—especially 
ice cream. Help our dairy farmers. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over 
the weekend, cases of the coronavirus 
have been confirmed in New York, 
Rhode Island, and Florida. Officials in 
Washington State have also reported 
that now six Americans have died from 
the coronavirus—the first fatalities in 
the United States. 
At this critical moment, we need an 
administration that acts with per-
sistent and unrelenting transparency 
and decisiveness, and that leans on the 
expertise of our scientists and doctors. 
But 
this 
administration, 
unfortu-
nately, has spent years hollowing out 
the domestic and global health secu-
rity teams in the executive branch. It 
has proposed cutting funding from the 
infectious disease rapid response fund, 
the emerging infectious disease ac-
count, and public health preparedness 
and response programs. Undoubtedly, 
the Trump administration would have 
been better prepared to respond to the 
coronavirus 
if 
the 
President 
had 
prioritized these programs rather than 
urged them to be cut. 
The administration’s early response 
efforts have not instilled much con-
fidence either. Testing kits were not 
promptly sent to the hospitals and 
medical labs around the country, polit-
ical personnel have overruled the rec-
ommendations of the CDC, and the ad-
ministration was slow to appoint any 
single official with public health exper-
tise to coordinate our government’s re-
sponse. 
Even now, President Trump seems to 
be spending more of his time blaming 
the media and blaming the Democrats 
than being constructive. In fact, he 
blames everyone not named Donald 
Trump. The President is downplaying— 
he is downplaying—the threat of the 
coronavirus to a dangerous degree, and 
his Chief of Staff, amazingly, said to 
Americans: 
‘‘Turn 
off 
your 
tele-
visions.’’ 
We know the history of how these vi-
ruses spread and work. When you deny 
them, when you don’t let people know 
what is happening and what to do 
about it, things get worse. Yet the 
President, being as self-centered as he 
is, only cares about himself and his 
image. As usual, instead of solving the

problem, he tries to blame somebody 
else. 
The deflection and finger-pointing 
and denial must stop. President Trump 
must take responsibility to ensure that 
everyone in the public health commu-
nity has the authority and the re-
sources needed. We need the President 
and his team to level with the Amer-
ican people and get a handle on the sit-
uation. 
Later this week, appropriators will 
put together an emergency supple-
mental package to surge resources into 
the domestic and global response and 
to help local communities quickly pre-
pare for the coronavirus. I have said 
that we need about $8.5 billion, and, 
from all reports, the appropriators are 
very close to that number, rather than 
the $2.5 billion the President talked 
about early on. That is good because 
when it comes to Americans’ health, 
when it comes to our safety, and when 
it comes to dealing with this problem 
head-on, skimping doesn’t make any 
sense at all. If there was ever some-
thing that is pennywise and pound fool-
ish, that is it. 
As this package comes together, I am 
going to have more to say, but, at a 
minimum, any package needs to have 
provisions that ensure that the Presi-
dent cannot transfer these new funds 
to anything other than the coronavirus 
and American and global preparedness 
to combat epidemics and infectious dis-
eases. 
Vaccines must be affordable and 
available to all who need them. Yester-
day, I called for vaccines, when devel-
oped, to be fully covered by Medicare, 
because seniors who need the vaccines 
most should not have to worry if they 
can afford it once it is available. 
There should be interest-free loans 
made available for small businesses im-
pacted by the outbreak, and State and 
local governments should be reim-
bursed and provided new grants for re-
sponse activities. In the meantime, the 
administration needs to keep working 
with 
local 
communities—including 
schools, universities, and local agen-
cies—on the steps they must take to 
prepare for an increase in coronavirus 
cases. 
Specifically, 
the 
administration 
needs to do the following: First, issue 
coherent guidance on what school dis-
tricts should do in the event the virus 
is detected in a community; second, es-
tablish a uniform screening policy for 
airports and ports of entry, as our 
frontline transportation professionals 
at TSA and CBP need clear guidance on 
the coronavirus; and, third, make it 
clear that our Federal scientists and 
medical experts can speak out freely 
and be heard by the American people— 
no gag rule, no downplaying this be-
cause that makes things worse when 
people don’t know the facts. 
Democrats are ready to work on a bi-
partisan basis to make sure Federal, 
State, and local officials are ready for 
whatever scenario the coronavirus pre-
sents. The President and his adminis-
tration and our colleagues in the Sen-
ate must be ready to do the same. 
ENERGY BILL 
Mr. President, on the Energy bill, to-
night the Senate will vote on a motion 
to proceed on a bill that will make 
changes to our Nation’s energy policy. 
Ranking Member MANCHIN and I have 
had several discussions with Chair-
woman MURKOWSKI and the Republican 
leader about having a fair amendment 
process on this legislation. As a result 
of these conversations, I will be voting 
yes on the motion tonight as a show of 
good faith. 
Democrats want amendments to the 
Energy bill so we can make real 
progress on climate change. That is 
what we are hoping to achieve this 
week. Few pieces of legislation offer 
more opportunity for progress on cli-
mate than those that concern our en-
ergy policy. We cannot miss this oppor-
tunity 
to 
make 
real, 
substantive 
progress on climate change. I am hope-
ful that our amendments this week and 
the potential progress we can make on 
climate change this week can be bipar-
tisan. 
For months, Republicans have been 
trying to adjust their posture on the 
most pressing issue facing our planet— 
the climate crisis. This bill provides a 
real test for Senate Republicans. Will 
they join Senate Democrats in fighting 
for and passing bipartisan legislation 
that will address climate change in a 
significant way, or will our Republican 
friends continue to do what they have 
done for the last several years—do the 
bidding of corporate polluters and Big 
Oil and block amendments with bipar-
tisan support? 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE 
Mr. President, finally, on the DNI, on 
Friday, after dismissing Acting Direc-
tor of National Intelligence Maguire 
and replacing him with Rick Grenell, a 
partisan loyalist with no experience, 
President Trump proposed installing as 
a permanent Director of National In-
telligence 
Representative 
JOHN 
RATCLIFFE of Texas. 
Replacing one highly partisan opera-
tive with another does nothing to keep 
our country safe. At a time when 
Vladimir Putin is once again inter-
fering in our elections, we need a non-
partisan leader with a high level of ex-
pertise and trust on both sides of the 
aisle, someone who sees the world ob-
jectively and speaks truth to power, at 
the helm of the intelligence commu-
nity. Neither Acting Director Grenell 
nor Representative RATCLIFFE
comes 
close to that standard. Representative 
RATCLIFFE, in particular, falls short of 
that high bar. 
John Negroponte became DNI after 
decades of working in the Foreign 
Service. 
Former 
Directors 
Dennis 
Blair, James Clapper, and Mike McCon-
nell—whatever you think of them indi-
vidually—came from both parties, and 
all had decades of experience in and 
working with the intelligence commu-
nity. Dan Coats, the President’s last 
nominee to this position, served as a 
diplomat, a Senator, and a sergeant in 
the Army before assuming the post. 
Representative 
RATCLIFFE, 
on 
the 
other hand, is a three-term tea party 
Congressman. He has shown extreme 
partisanship in the House. He lacks the 
experience required to lead a commu-
nity of 17 intelligence agencies. 
The experience Mr. RATCLIFFE does 
have in Congress has been alarmingly 
partisan. He was a fierce critic of the 
Mueller 
investigation 
and 
earned 
praise from deep-state conspiracy theo-
rists. During the Mueller hearings, 
RATCLIFFE badgered the former special 
counsel with baseless lines of ques-
tioning—highly partisan and not at all 
related to fact. He didn’t seem to care. 
He showed little regard for the serious-
ness of Putin’s interference in our elec-
tions and the need for election secu-
rity. 
Since World War II, since OSS, and 
since the formation of the CIA, the in-
telligence agencies have, by and large, 
been immune from politics. Like he 
does with everything else, this Presi-
dent seems to make them the arm of 
his likes and dislikes, of what is good 
for him and what is not good for him, 
even if he denigrates these fine men 
and woman. He doesn’t seem to care 
that we need intelligence agencies who 
find the truth and tell the Congress 
and the American people the truth. 
Now he appoints a rank partisan to 
this agency, someone he probably sees 
on FOX News mouthing the conspiracy 
theories that only the President and 
his avid supporters seem to believe. 
It is such a decline in America when 
this great agency, where people have 
risked their lives for America quietly, 
is made into a political football to 
serve one man, Donald Trump, who we 
all know doesn’t really have a pench-
ant for truth, for honor, and for de-
cency. 
With 
this 
nomination, 
President 
Trump has again shown a lack of re-
spect for the rule of law and for the in-
telligence community, which Repub-
lican and Democratic Presidents have 
all shown in the past. 
Republicans must join Democrats in 
swiftly rejecting the nomination of the 
partisan Mr. RATCLIFFE. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
new coronavirus, or COVID–19, contin-
ued to capture headlines over the 
weekend. News of the first American 
deaths related to the disease confirm 
this is a public health challenge that is 
upon us. 
The Senate’s immediate role is clear:

and local public health officials and 
healthcare professionals who are work-
ing overtime to blunt, delay, and miti-
gate the spread of the virus. I am 
grateful that our colleagues Chairman 
SHELBY and Senator LEAHY, along with 
their appropriations counterparts in 
the House, worked through the week-
end on a bipartisan, bicameral agree-
ment to provide supplemental appro-
priations for the coordinated response. 
It goes without saying that a chal-
lenge like this leaves no time for mov-
ing goalposts or performative outrage. 
The American people deserve for their 
Congress to meet this subject head-on, 
with a bipartisan and collaborative ap-
proach, and I am confident that is ex-
actly what can and will happen. 
I am glad our prospects for supple-
mental 
appropriations 
rest 
in 
the 
hands of a bipartisan group of nego-
tiators. I would encourage my Demo-
cratic colleagues in both Houses to let 
them do their work. It will be impor-
tant to pass this first benchmark and 
supply these important funds within 
the next 2 weeks. 
TALIBAN 
Mr. President, on another matter, on 
Saturday, President Trump announced 
a new agreement with the Taliban that 
is designed to promote a peaceful end 
to the civil war in Afghanistan. 
First and foremost, we must recog-
nize the brave men and women of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. Hundreds of thou-
sands of U.S. troops have deployed to 
Afghanistan since our national secu-
rity compelled us in 2001 to confront 
the terrorist threats emanating from 
that failed state that Afghanistan had 
become. More than 2,400 American 
servicemembers have given their lives 
in Afghanistan. More than 20,000 have 
been wounded. Our coalition partners, 
such as the United Kingdom and Can-
ada, sustained casualties as well. 
Obviously the worst burden of all has 
fallen on the Afghan people. Tens of 
thousands of Afghan security forces 
and civilians have been killed during 
this long, long war. 
It is largely due to these brave, he-
roic, and sustained efforts to keep pres-
sure on the terrorists that Afghanistan 
has not come roaring back as an inter-
national headquarters for terrorists. 
Thanks to these efforts, the United 
States and its Afghan partners are 
hopefully in a position to bring about a 
negotiated end to the conflict. 
After nearly 20 years, two basic prin-
ciples are clear: No. 1, we should wel-
come any serious opportunity to bring 
greater stability to that land, but, No. 
2, we must make certain that the 
progress won through great sacrifice by 
Afghans and Americans is not under-
mined by a precipitous rush for the 
exits. 
I do not trust the Taliban, so I am 
grateful the linchpin of the agreement 
is a conditions-based approach that 
will provide our commanders with le-
verage to test the will and the capacity 
of the Taliban to abide by the agree-
ment. If all goes well at first, our 
American presence would stabilize with 
8,600 troops for the time being. Having 
heard from our commanders, I agree 
that presence will remain an important 
tool as we combat the ongoing threats 
posed by the likes of al-Qaida and ISIS 
and support for the Afghans’ ability to 
fight terrorism themselves. 
Since further drawdowns would re-
quire even further progress and co-
operation from the Taliban, I look for-
ward to hearing from administration 
officials, 
intelligence 
analysts, 
and 
military officers about how they will 
judge 
compliance 
and 
determine 
whether the conditions are, in fact, 
met. For my part, I believe the intra- 
Afghan 
negotiations 
are 
especially 
critical to the future of that country 
and to our own significant security in-
terests over there. We should do what 
we can to help the Afghans achieve a 
peaceful solution to their conflict. 
I am glad to hear there are no secret 
annexes to this agreement which Con-
gress will be denied, as there were with 
President Obama’s Iran deal. The se-
cret documents detailing implementa-
tion arrangements are available for the 
review of all Senators in Senate Secu-
rity, and I encourage our colleagues to 
review the full details. 
Republicans 
spent 
much 
of 
the 
Obama administration reminding our 
colleagues that hope—hope—is not a 
strategy. We argued President Obama’s 
reckless withdrawal from Iraq would 
set the stage for chaos and a resur-
gence of terrorism. Unfortunately, the 
rise of ISIS proved us correct. 
That is why, more than a year ago, I 
offered an amendment so the Senate 
could affirm that withdrawing from 
Syria or Afghanistan the wrong way 
could strengthen the hand of terrorists 
and competitors such as Russia and 
Iran while weakening our own vital in-
terests. 
I believe from my conversations with 
senior administration officials that 
they went into these negotiations with 
their 
eyes 
wide 
open 
about 
the 
Taliban’s duplicitous nature. I expect 
Members of both parties will have 
many questions about this agreement 
and look forward to briefings from the 
administration about the path forward 
to protect American interests in Af-
ghanistan and ensure this war ends on 
terms favorable to those interests. 
Our fight against ISIS, al-Qaida, and 
other radical Islamic terrorists is not 
over. As my colleagues and I have said 
for years, even if the United States 
were to choose to walk away from the 
conflict, the conflict would not walk 
away from us. We learned that on Sep-
tember 11. We relearned it with the rise 
of ISIS. I hope we never need to learn 
it again. 
So the war is not over, but this 
agreement may foster the negotiations 
and discussions within Afghanistan 
that would be necessary to bring it to 
a close. 
JOHN RATCLIFFE 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
on Friday, President Trump announced 
he intends to nominate Representative 
JOHN RATCLIFFE of Texas to serve as 
Director of National Intelligence. I am 
glad the President has elected to nomi-
nate a permanent DNI so the Senate 
can provide our advice and consent on 
this crucial position. 
As I mentioned last week, the men 
and women of the intelligence commu-
nity fulfill a wide array of sensitive 
and critically important missions. The 
Office of the DNI is central to coordi-
nating these efforts in a strong fashion. 
It gives no quarter to politicization or 
partisan bias. I am glad the adminis-
tration will seek Senate confirmation 
for the position. 
President Trump has a strong track 
record of sending the Senate impres-
sive nominees for national security 
posts who are well prepared to protect 
our Nation and defend our interests. 
The impressive leadership of Sec-
retary Esper at the Department of De-
fense, Director Haspel at the CIA, Gen-
eral Nakasone at the National Security 
Agency, and other leaders have proven 
that President Trump has an eye for 
talent and confirms that the Senate’s 
trust in each of them was well placed. 
I hope Congressman RATCLIFFE will 
impress Senators just as did the other 
members of the President’s team and 
earn a bipartisan confirmation vote. I 
trust Chairman BURR
and our col-
leagues on the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence will oversee a 
prompt and fair confirmation process, 
and I look forward to meeting the 
nominee myself. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
has 
worked overtime to unwind the failures 
of the 8 years that preceded it. We have 
taken big strides to renew America’s 
national security and our strength on 
the world stage. We must keep up this 
crucial work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO JOSH SPEIDEL 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every-
body has a story. Actually, everybody 
has a journey, when you think of life. 
Some are heartbreaking, but some are 
uplifting, and some are hopeful. To-
morrow night, during senior night, the 
University of Vermont men’s basket-
ball team is going to celebrate one 
story that is all of these things: heart-
breaking, uplifting, and hopeful. They 
will celebrate that when senior Josh 
Speidel takes the court for the first 
time—and what will be the only time— 
in his college career. 
Josh is a native of Columbus, IN. He 
dreamed from a very young age of play-
ing college basketball. At Columbus 
North High School in Indiana, Josh 
was the basketball team’s all-time lead

point scorer and an Indiana All-Star. 
In November of 2014, just before his 
senior basketball season, he committed 
to play for the University of Vermont, 
and he accepted a scholarship at the 
university to play for the team. 
Here is the heartbreaking part. Just 
a few months later, in February of 2015, 
Josh’s dream was derailed when he suf-
fered a traumatic brain injury, result-
ing from a devastating car crash. Josh 
would go on to spend the next 4 months 
in the hospital and in rehab. But just a 
few days after the accident, the Univer-
sity of Vermont’s head coach, John 
Becker, went to Indiana and visited 
Josh there with a simple message for 
him: You are still welcome at UVM. 
Your scholarship will be honored, and 
we will help you in any way we can. 
That is, after all, the Vermont way. 
Josh would ultimately arrive at UVM 
in August of 2016. While he hasn’t suit-
ed up with the team, he has worked 
with trainers; he has improved his 
physical condition; and he has re-
mained active on the court. What is so 
inspiring, his team was at his side 
throughout. He has been a constant fix-
ture of the team, on the sidelines at 
games, cheering his teammates on. I 
have been at games and have seen him 
doing that. 
Off the court, Josh has been working 
toward a degree through the College of 
Education. He is choosing a self-de-
signed major to prepare him to work 
with children through sports, with a 
double minor in behavior change and 
coaching. 
He has been a committed student 
throughout his time at UVM. He is set 
to graduate this May. After gradua-
tion, Josh hopes to use both his life ex-
perience and his education to work 
with children. 
Tomorrow night, the University of 
Vermont men’s basketball team will 
celebrate senior night. In a special ar-
rangement with their opponent, Al-
bany, Josh, wearing number 32, will 
suit up, take the court, and notch the 
night’s first basket after the tip-off. 
I so wish I could be there because 
when Josh steps off the court, it will 
surely be to the standing ovation of 
this young man—the personification of 
perseverance, determination, dedica-
tion, and hope he so richly deserves. I 
know my fellow Vermonters who are at 
these games, and I know there will be 
very few dry eyes in the house. 
We are, all of us, the product of our 
life experiences, of the community that 
supports us, and of the will we carry to 
press on. Josh Speidel is a remarkable 
young man. At the packed gym tomor-
row night, there is going to be an emo-
tional and vibrant celebration. 
Josh, from the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate, I congratulate you on a recogni-
tion so richly deserved. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
an article from the Burlington Free 
Press 
highlighting 
Josh’s 
journey, 
dated March 1, 2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

UVM’S JOSH SPEIDEL AND HIS REMARKABLE 
JOURNEY
SET
FOR
EMOTIONAL
STAGE
ON 
SENIOR NIGHT 
(By Alex Abramif) 
Fruit was a big part of Josh Speidel’s diet 
when he first arrived at the University of 
Vermont in the summer of 2016. 
‘‘He just loved bananas, it was his main 
food,’’ said Everett Duncan, Speidel’s dorm 
roommate that year, ‘‘I’m personally OK 
with bananas, but I was wondering, ‘Where 
are we getting all these fruit flies?’ And at 
the time Josh was leaving them in this little 
trash can that he had on the right side of his 
desk.’’ 
A brief argument ensued. 
‘‘I was like, ‘You are not eating bananas in 
here anymore, just keep it at the dining 
hall,’ ’’ Duncan recalled. ‘‘But then I realized 
that I’m yelling at this man for eating ba-
nanas. It’s funny now when we think about 
it.’’ 
The next year, Speidel roomed with an-
other teammate, Ben Shungu. The duo would 
take advantage of the 5-minute walk from 
their University Heights dorm to Patrick 
Gym, routinely setting the alarm clock be-
fore 6 a.m. for workouts. Most mornings the 
UVM men’s basketball players had the gym 
to themselves. 
On one end of the court, there was Shungu 
working on his jumper with a shooting ma-
chine. And on the other end, there was 
Speidel putting up layups and doing his exer-
cises. 
‘‘We would get up and do our thing,’’ 
Shungu said. 
Fast-forward to the past two years: Speidel 
moved into an off-campus house with Dun-
can, Shungu and the rest of his upperclass-
men teammates on the UVM men’s basket-
ball team, the sort of thing college student- 
athletes everywhere do. 
Except none of it was guaranteed for 
Speidel when he stepped onto the Burlington 
campus in 2016. 
Already committed and signed with the 
Catamounts when he was a senior at Colum-
bus North High School in Indiana, Speidel 
was in a car accident on Super Bowl Sunday 
in 2015—one that caused a traumatic brain 
injury, left him in a coma for weeks and 
nearly took his life. 
The 6-foot-8, 215-pound star forward went 
from averaging 25.6 points and 9.3 rebounds a 
game to learning how to walk and talk 
again. Basketball, his passion, remained a 
guiding light on his road to recovery, on his 
path back to being an independent person. 
‘‘It’s 
unbelievable 
what’s 
he’s 
gone 
through,’’ Shungu said. ‘‘To see him stand on 
his own two feet and just living his life—it’s 
just incredible, an incredible story. 
‘‘His story definitely inspires.’’ 
And more than five years after that acci-
dent, Speidel will finally fulfill a dream he’s 
had since he was a little kid: Play in a Divi-
sion I college basketball game. 
The Catamounts’ senior night on Tuesday 
has afforded Speidel the chance to suit up 
and start for the first and only time in his 
career. In a pre-game arrangement, Speidel 
and Albany, UVM’s opponent, will trade bas-
kets after the opening tip. Then Speidel will 
exit, surely to a lengthy standing ovation 
from the Vermont faithful. 
‘‘I didn’t get to experience my senior night 
in high school, I didn’t get to walk out with 
my parents,’’ Speidel said. ‘‘I don’t think it’s 
hit me fully yet, but just being able to walk 
them out and embrace them and thank (my 
parents), thank coach (John Becker) for all 
he’s done—it will be pretty emotional. It’s 
hard to put into words. 
‘‘For four years I’ve been hearing the 
starting lineup and I’ve always envisioned 
my name said. I think that’ll be something.’’ 
Speidel’s parents, Dave and Lisa, have also 
waited—and hoped—for a day like this to ar-
rive. 
‘‘It’s a moment we believed would happen. 
We never wanted Josh to give up,’’ Lisa 
Speidel said. ‘‘Without basketball, Josh 
wouldn’t be where he is. Without UVM, Josh 
wouldn’t be where he is.’’ 
DETERMINATION, FAITH DRIVE RECOVERY 
About six months after the accident, a doc-
tor’s evaluation didn’t forecast a favorable 
outcome for Speidel’s reading comprehen-
sion. 
‘‘He said Joshua wouldn’t be above a 
fourth-grade level, ever,’’ Lisa Speidel said. 
‘‘I told him that you are not going to tell 
Joshua that and he agreed,’’ she said. ‘‘I still 
have those results in an envelope, but I have 
yet to open it.’’ 
Not long after that, Josh Speidel began an 
online course at a community college and 
started seeing noticeable gains in his recov-
ery. 
‘‘Things really started clicking for Joshua 
then, it was really amazing,’’ Lisa Speidel 
said. Positivity was a must. There was no 
room for negative vibes or prognoses that 
didn’t align with the Speidels’ confidence for 
a full recovery. 
Josh Speidel and his parents also relied on 
their religious beliefs for strength and direc-
tion. 
‘‘Faith has always been instrumental in 
my well-being and having that relationship 
with God has always been first in my life,’’ 
Josh Speidel said. ‘‘Sticking with that 
through the ups and downs, my parents 
never wavered in their faith, they never took 
a step back and questioned God. Seeing how 
they handled it, I think helped me and con-
tinues to help me.’’ 
Becker, in his ninth year as bench boss of 
the Catamounts, flew out to Indiana during 
a snowstorm just a couple days after 
Speidel’s accident. Becker told the Speidels 
that their son had a scholarship waiting for 
him when he was ready (the NCAA later 
granted UVM a scholarship waiver). 
‘‘You could see the qualities that made 
him a great player, just really determined 
and hardworking and competitive,’’ Becker 
said. ‘‘He’s just a wonderful person off the 
court and takes time with people. 
‘‘Only a special person can come as far as 
he has in just a couple years.’’ 
UVM has reached the NCAA Tournament 
twice, produced the America East Con-
ference’s first unbeaten season and garnered 
the league’s top seed in four straight seasons 
during 
Speidel’s 
time 
in 
Burlington— 
achievements Becker believes are forever 
tied to Speidel. 
‘‘I told Josh that the (four) years he’s been 
here are the best years of this program’s his-
tory arguably. I don’t think that’s a coinci-
dence,’’ Becker said. ‘‘It’s hard to know why. 
I just think there’s something that you can’t 
really explain and you don’t know what it is, 
but there’s something there—he’s been in 
some way a big part of it and he’ll always be 
linked to this program’s history in my 
mind.’’ 
SPEIDEL CONTINUES TO INSPIRE UVM TEAM 
UVM associate head coach Kyle Cieplicki 
was the lead recruiter on getting Speidel to 
commit to UVM back in Aug. 2014. Cieplicki 
spent about a year on the recruitment trail 
of a rising star from a hoops-crazed state 
who was fielding more than a dozen D–1 of-
fers and had drawn interest from Mark Few 
of Gonzaga. 
‘‘We’ve never recruited a kid harder than 
when we recruited Josh. He went on a limb

to choose us,’’ Cieplicki said. ‘‘His commit-
ment was really special to me and the rest of 
the staff.’’ 
The accident and how Speidel approached 
his life on a daily basis revealed a side 
Cieplicki had yet to see. 
‘‘He’s shown me and all of us how to handle 
adversity,’’ Cieplicki said. ‘‘To have to work 
as hard as he did to get back and then to deal 
with the emotional component, the mental 
component of physically not being what he 
once was and to see him deal with that every 
day and maintain his work ethic and work 
habits—that’s the biggest inspiration. 
‘‘A lot of things have changed for him but 
it’s never allowed him to slow down.’’ While 
senior night can’t replace a playing career 
that didn’t come to fruition, Speidel can 
soak in the achievement of earning this mo-
ment in front of hometown fans. 
‘‘To see him out there and participating, 
it’s going to be a crazy thing,’’ Everett Dun-
can said. 
Duncan’s the lone player left on the team 
when Speidel was honored before a Jan. 2016 
game vs. Stony Brook. Duncan said his fel-
low Indiana native continues to motivate the 
Catamounts. 
‘‘I think he’s meant everything. I know 
that every single guy in the locker room 
wants him to play,’’ Duncan said. ‘‘There are 
days we see him on the sidelines watching 
every single second of practice. For some of 
us like Benny, Anthony and me, we’ve 
known him for such a long time, he’s one of 
our best friends. 
‘‘Even now, this is our last go-round, Josh 
is with us. He’s more a part of this senior 
class than me or Anthony. He’s a big part of 
this senior class who’s done a lot for us.’’ 
SPEIDEL WILL GRADUATE IN MAY 
Driven to return to the game he loves, 
Speidel came to grips with one harsh reality: 
He wasn’t going to play basketball for UVM. 
Though that didn’t make it any easier to ac-
cept. 
‘‘It’s a tough question but I’ve battled with 
that for a while. Obviously, I’m OK with that 
I’m not able to play and I’m not back to 
where I was,’’ Speidel said. ‘‘That was a 
tough pill to swallow, but when I think 
about all that I’ve gained, maybe I didn’t get 
back to playing, but I’m still bettering my-
self by working out every day and being in 
the best shape physically and basketball has 
helped me with that.’’ 
Speidel put his focus and much of his en-
ergy into his classes and becoming more 
independent away from school. He learned to 
cook 
for 
himself—a 
crockpot 
came 
in 
handy—and manage his money. 
And when it came to living off campus, it 
was Speidel who pushed for it. 
‘‘I told my parents that I just wanted to 
test myself. I wanted to see if I was able to 
take care of myself,’’ Speidel said. 
In school, Speidel has earned a 3.40 grade- 
point average, the highest on the team, 
through an individualized major in education 
and social services. He also has a double 
minor in behavior change and coaching. 
‘‘Josh has always had a knack for working 
with kids and relating to kids. To see that 
more amplified after his accident is just awe-
some,’’ said Lisa Speidel, an elementary 
school principal. 
Speidel will graduate this May—in four 
years’ time. How remarkable is that? 
Speidel shied away from praising himself. 
‘‘It’s kind of hard to say that for myself be-
cause I’m living it. But I love when people 
say, ‘Oh Josh, you’ve come so far’ or ‘Josh, 
you are walking so much better,’ ’’ Speidel 
said. ‘‘It’s those little things that go such a 
long way and it gives me a sense that all this 
hard work is doing something.’’ 
The network of support at UVM—from aca-
demic advisors, teachers, teammates, coach-
es and athletic trainers—hasn’t been lost on 
Speidel and his mother. 
‘‘I can’t put into words how thankful and 
how blessed and lucky I am,’’ Speidel said. 
Lisa Speidel: ‘‘We love UVM and every-
thing they have meant and done for us. It’s 
amazing.’’ 
Josh Speidel is 24 years old. He said he 
could write a book of all the things he’s been 
through and learned over the last five years. 
If anything stood out above it all, if there 
was anything Speidel wanted others to ab-
sorb from his story, it was this: Don’t give 
up on your dreams. 
‘‘I tell this to people: Always have an end 
goal in your head and chase after it as hard 
as you can,’’ Speidel said. ‘‘And whenever 
you need help, ask the people around you be-
cause I think there are more people than you 
think who are there to help you. 
‘‘I’ve held on to that and really tried to 
live by that.’’ 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
want to do this because in an era where 
we hear so much bad news, it is won-
derful to hear inspiring news. This is 
an inspiring young man. I congratulate 
him and the University of Vermont for 
what they have done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I note 
that somebody else is not waiting to 
speak. When somebody does, I, of 
course, will yield the floor. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, I want to bring my 
colleagues up to date on where my 
head is as vice chairman of Appropria-
tions. All of us worked very hard 
throughout the weekend and all last 
week—Republicans and Democrats to-
gether—along with our counterparts in 
the other body. 
Each one of us looks with some trepi-
dation to the latest report on the virus 
attacks, including the serious ones in 
the United States, and the deaths that 
have occurred around the world. We are 
trying to put together an appropria-
tions bill that will give our administra-
tion the tools they need to protect 
America and to help our allies, not 
only to protect us from having what 
has come to our shores but what is al-
ready in our shores, the coronavirus— 
that we be able to protect Americans 
from it. 
I want to compliment those who have 
been working on it in both parties. As 
often happens in the Appropriations 
Committee, we pretty well leave our 
labels at the door. We work together— 
both Republicans and Democrats—to 
get a good bill. I urge both the major-
ity leader and the Democratic leader 
that, once we have it and as soon as the 
House acts, there will be an appropria-
tions bill. They will go first, but we 
move very quickly. 
Frankly, when I look at the dangers 
facing America, I am perfectly willing 
to stay here throughout the weekend, 
if need be, as many of us did last week-
end, to get this passed and on the 
President’s desk. We are not Repub-
licans or Democrats in this matter. We 
are Americans, and we are U.S. Sen-
ators. The Senate has so often set the 
standards for the rest of the country. 
We can do it here. I hope that as soon 
as we can vote on this, we will. 
I commend Senator SHELBY. He is the 
chairman of the committee. I am the 
vice chairman of the committee. We 
have worked together. I also commend 
all the other Senators, both Repub-
licans 
and 
Democrats, 
who 
have 
worked with us. 
I hope this body will be able to vote, 
ideally this week—if not this week, the 
very first part of next week. This is an 
important matter. Cancel the weekend, 
if need be. Stay here and get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, today 
is Texas Independence Day. One hun-
dred eighty-four years ago today, Tex-
ans declared our independence—de-
clared our independence from Mexico 
and fired a shot for liberty that was 
heard around the world. 
As I have a number of years in the 
past, I am going to read the letter from 
the Alamo that LTC William Barret 
Travis wrote calling for help. It is a 
letter that energized the Texans across 
our great State, that energized lovers 
of liberty. It is also a letter that I read 
the very first time I spoke on this Sen-
ate floor, and these are words to in-
spire everyone. 
Commandancy of the Alamo 
Bejar, Feby. 24th, 1836 
To the People of Texas & All Americans in 
the World— 
Fellow Citizens & compatriots— 
I am besieged, by a thousand or more of 
the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sus-
tained a continual Bombardment & can-
nonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. 
The enemy has demanded a surrender at dis-
cretion, otherwise the garrison are to be put 
to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have an-
swered the demand with a cannon shot, & 
and our flag still waves proudly from the 
walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. 
Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, 
of patriotism & everything dear to the Amer-
ican character, to come to our aid, with all 
dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforce-
ments daily & will no doubt increase to three 
or four thousand in four or five days. If this 
call is neglected, I am determined to sustain 
myself as long as possible & die like a soldier 
who never forgets what is due to his own 
honor & that of his country—Victory or 
Death. 
William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Comdt. 
P.S. The Lord is on our side—When the 
enemy appeared in sight we had not three 
bushels of corn—We have since found in de-
serted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the 
walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1244 
March 2, 2020 
The brave men and women of the 
Alamo gave their lives for liberty. But 
shortly thereafter, in the Battle of San 
Jacinto, the Texans were victorious, 
and the Republic of Texas was formed, 
an independent nation from 1836 to 
1845. For 9 years, we were our own na-
tion. Then Texas joined the United 
States of America. We are proud Amer-
icans, but we are proud of the history 
of the brave Texans. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The senior Senator from 
Alaska. 
S. 2657 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
am here on the floor this afternoon be-
cause we will very shortly have a vote 
on the motion to proceed to S. 2657. 
This is the vehicle for our bipartisan 
American Energy Innovation Act. 
I am here today to kick things off 
and just let colleagues know some of 
the highlights of this measure that my 
colleague and ranking member on the 
Energy Committee, Senator MANCHIN, 
and I have been working on for some 
time. When I say ‘‘some time,’’ I think 
those here in the Senate know that 
when you take up substantive energy 
bills, whether they are focused on en-
ergy or whether they are focused on 
lands, we spend a lot of time giving 
good committee process to bring these 
matters to the floor. 
The measure that we have in front of 
us is the American Energy Innovation 
Act. You will hear it referred to by its 
acronym, AEIA, which makes you want 
to do a joke about the vowels—a, e, i, 
o, u, and sometimes y. I can give you 
that, but I am not going to do that 
today. 
The reality is that we have been 
working on energy reform now for al-
most a dozen years. Twelve years is a 
long time, since we have last refreshed 
and updated our energy policies. This 
act contains priorities from more than 
60 Members of the Senate. So to sug-
gest that it is a bipartisan bill—it is 
more than bipartisan. It has Repub-
lican priorities and Democratic prior-
ities and priorities from urban and 
rural areas. It is a package that really 
does help move the ball forward when 
we think about energy and energy in-
novation and energy security. 
I want to extend my particular 
thanks to my good friend and ranking 
member on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee, Senator MANCHIN 
of West Virginia. He is going to be on 
the floor in just a couple of minutes to 
speak, as we take up this motion to 
proceed. From the start of this Con-
gress, he and I have really been focused 
on modernizing our Nation’s energy 
policies, and this bipartisan package 
that we have assembled will do just 
that. So, again, I credit my ranking 
member. 
I also credit the great work that both 
of our teams have brought to this very 
important national discussion. It has 
been a long process but one where I 
think Members will look critically at 
the package that is in front of them 
and realize that we have worked hard 
to address what more we could be doing 
to modernize our energy policy. 
I have been framing this American 
Energy Innovation Act into two buck-
ets, if you will—innovation and secu-
rity. Innovation includes everything 
from the renewables to vehicle tech-
nologies, to carbon capture utilization, 
to efficiency. Then you have the secu-
rity side, which is the security of your 
supply chain and what that means to 
make sure you have access to minerals 
that allow you to build out your renew-
able energy projects. You view that se-
curity from a defense perspective. How 
do we ensure that our grids are secure 
and modernized and, again, secure from 
the perspective of economic security, 
when we ensure good jobs for Ameri-
cans, from Alaska to Arkansas. 
So our bill promotes energy effi-
ciency, renewable energy, energy stor-
age—this is what so many of us have 
been speaking about for so long—ad-
vanced nuclear, industrial and vehicle 
technologies, carbon capture utiliza-
tion and storage. 
We review a number of broad-based 
support programs, including weather-
ization assistance. In so many of our 
communities, especially in our cold 
States, which we are thinking about 
right now—but also during the summer 
months, when it is hot—weatherization 
assistance programs are a key for so 
many of the people whom we work for. 
We also renew ARPA-E. ARPA-E is 
that innovation hub within the Depart-
ment of Energy that has really helped 
to build out so much in energy innova-
tion. 
We have also included timely provi-
sions to strengthen our Nation’s min-
eral security and cyber security, as we 
modernize the electric grid and bolster 
workforce development. 
What we have worked to build are 
consensus policies that will help this 
country maintain its status as a global 
energy leader—and we are a global en-
ergy leader. 
We also want to ensure that we are 
providing affordable energy for our 
families and businesses and know that 
all of this helps to strengthen our na-
tional security and increase our global 
competitiveness. 
These policies will also lead to the 
development of low- and zero-emissions 
technologies that will help us address 
climate change and protect our envi-
ronment. 
Now, you are going to have some peo-
ple who might say: Well, this measure 
doesn’t solve climate change. You 
haven’t worked to reduce emissions to 
zero. 
I will stand before you and acknowl-
edge that is the case, but what we are 
doing is recognizing that this is a nec-
essary first step to update, to refresh, 
and to modernize energy policies that 
haven’t seen an upgrade, if you will, in 
a dozen years, and to help incentivize 
these technologies that will get us to 
that cleaner energy future and really 
allow for a level of transition that will 
help protect the environment. These 
are the steps that we are taking today 
to focus on innovation in the energy 
space and the security of supply, eco-
nomic security for the workforce, and 
physical security, when it comes to our 
energy grids. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
is a good bill. You are going to hear me 
say that a lot this week. It is a good 
bill. It was developed the right way, 
through regular order—something that 
we don’t see often enough around here. 
It is one of those things that the En-
ergy Committee has developed a rep-
utation for—using regular order—and 
we will see that regular order dem-
onstrated here on the floor. 
This measure deserves to advance 
through the legislative process and to 
become law. We have an opportunity to 
legislate in a meaningful way for the 
American people. I think all of us have 
a little bit of pent-up energy, if you 
will, to get to legislating. We will have 
that opportunity in just a little bit. 
I would strongly encourage every 
Member to vote in favor of the motion 
to proceed to this important legisla-
tion. 
Mr. President, I see that my friend, 
the Senator from West Virginia, the 
ranking member, has come to the floor. 
I know he is going to give more ex-
tended remarks about the measure, 
speaking to some of the priorities. 
After we complete the vote here in 
about 15 minutes on the motion to pro-
ceed, I will have an opportunity to 
speak more fully about some of the de-
tails, but, again, I want to repeat, 
while my friend is here with me, that 
this opportunity to really shape legis-
lation in a space that is so needed is 
one that he embraced from the minute 
he assumed the role as ranking mem-
ber. The two of us asked: What is it 
that we can build? 
We are not interested in messaging. 
We are not interested in having hear-
ings to have hearings for hearings’ 
sake. We are interested in making a 
difference when it comes to our Na-
tion’s policy, and I think that we have 
done it. We have done it because of a 
good, cooperative process. So I want to 
thank my colleague. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, before 
my colleague leaves, I want to thank 
the Senator from Alaska, my chair-
man, for all the hard work, because it 
has been a labor that both of us have 
worked on together. It is something 
our country needs very desperately, 
and it is something that we have been 
working on for some 12 or 13 years. So 
the time has come. 
With that, I am pleased that we are 
starting the process of turning to the 
American 
Energy 
Innovation 
Act, 
which last year Senator MURKOWSKI 
and I kicked off in the 116th Congress 
with a hearing on the outlook of en-
ergy innovation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1245 
March 2, 2020 
Over the course of the last 14 months, 
we have heard from experts who have 
come before the committee to testify 
on the importance of advancing a broad 
range of technologies. Where we stand 
today, we have no silver bullet to solve 
the problems that we face—namely, 
maintaining our affordable, reliable en-
ergy and reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions, while also making sure that 
hard-working 
families 
and 
commu-
nities are not left behind. 
It is for this reason that I say we 
need to innovate, not eliminate. I re-
peat that—innovate, not eliminate. 
There is a misconception that all these 
emissions are coming from just the 
power industry, just one source. It is 
all we hear about. It is not true. 
The facts are these: In 2017, the power 
sector was responsible for 27.5 percent 
of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The 
power industry—coal-fired powerplants 
and natural gas plants now are deter-
mined—was responsible for 271⁄2
per-
cent. Twenty-nine percent of our emis-
sions come from transportation. How 
we come to work and what we use in 
everyday life—29 percent comes from 
that. Twenty-two percent comes from 
industry—the jobs that we do, the in-
dustries we have that we need, jobs 
that are provided, and the products 
they produce. Then 111⁄2 percent was 
commercial and residential sectors— 
the buildings we are in, commercial 
and residential, but basically a lot of 
government buildings. 
With that in mind, we focused on an 
‘‘all of the above’’ approach. We didn’t 
leave any rock unturned. Our bill will 
help reduce emissions in all of these 
sectors, except for agriculture. Agri-
culture represents about 9 percent of 
the greenhouse gas emissions, and that 
was not in our jurisdiction. 
Innovation is a critical step to help 
us reliably meet tomorrow’s energy 
needs while reducing emissions, not 
just in our energy sector but also in in-
dustry, buildings, and vehicles. We all 
know greenhouse gas emissions are a 
global issue, and investing now in these 
technologies will position the United 
States as a global leader and maintain 
our competitive edge. 
It is time to seek practical solutions 
to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 
and find ways to ensure that our en-
ergy sector, the environment, and 
workers can all benefit. Once we vote 
to proceed to S. 2657, we will be laying 
down the American Energy Innovation 
Act of 2020 as a substitute amendment. 
This legislation brings together the 
strong, bipartisan work of our com-
mittee over the past year and draws 
from 53 bills. And I will repeat—39 of 
those are bipartisan. Once it is en-
acted, it will provide the first com-
prehensive Senate energy policy up-
date in 13 years. 
This bill represents an important 
downpayment on research and develop-
ment at the Department of Energy for 
a range of technologies to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it 
would advance innovative technologies 
that can help us reduce emissions 
across sectors of the economy that ac-
count for 90 percent of current U.S. 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
This piece of legislation will put us 
on the path to reduce 90 percent of the 
current greenhouse gas emissions. That 
includes energy storage, renewable en-
ergy, energy efficiency, carbon cap-
ture, advanced nuclear, vehicles, and 
provisions to help get those tech-
nologies out of DOE and into the mar-
ket. 
As I have said before, there is no sil-
ver bullet, and this bill alone will not 
solve climate change, but it is critical. 
It is a critical step in the right direc-
tion, not just here in the United States 
but also for the rest of the world. I am 
going to take a few minutes to touch 
on a few of these now. 
Let me start with our existing zero- 
carbon, baseload generation, nuclear. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. nuclear indus-
try has been losing ground to inter-
national competitors, especially those 
with state-funded nuclear programs 
like China and Russia. That is why I 
worked with Senator MURKOWSKI
to 
create a robust R&D program that will 
develop new technologies to not only 
usher in a new era of nuclear but also 
reduce the operating costs of the cur-
rent nuclear fleet that will be required 
to operate into the middle of this cen-
tury if we as a nation are to meet our 
emission-reduction objectives. 
We also included my EFFECT Act, 
which invests in research and develop-
ment and, just as importantly, dem-
onstration and deployment for each as-
pect of carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage. This includes coal and natural 
gas technologies, utilization, storage, 
and even atmospheric CO2 removal. 
Fossil fuels are projected to continue 
to be a significant source of electric 
generation in the near future, not just 
here in the United States but around 
the world. We need to get ahead of the 
curve and invest in the technologies 
that will allow us to continue using 
them but in the cleanest way possible 
so we are reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
We also included provisions to target 
industrial emissions that are particu-
larly hard to get to with existing tech-
nologies. 
With all of this, we need to continue 
to 
create 
quality 
jobs 
in 
this 
transitioning energy landscape. All of 
these provisions will protect and create 
jobs while addressing carbon emis-
sions—a win-win for communities in 
West Virginia and rural communities 
across this country. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
also covers a lot of territory when it 
comes to renewable energy, from the 
skies and hilltops to the rivers and 
oceans. The bill includes incentives for 
small hydropower facilities and an ex-
pansion of the Department of Energy’s 
work on marine renewable energy. It 
also tackles expanding geothermal en-
ergy beyond the Western States. 
Lastly, the energy package reauthor-
izes two incredibly successful programs 
at DOE that have already helped trans-
form our energy landscape in large and 
small ways; that is, wind and solar 
technologies. The bill focuses these 
programs on new materials, enhanced 
efficiency in design and operation, and 
their full life cycle from manufac-
turing to recycling. I want to make 
sure these clean energy technologies 
are aiding the grid and the commu-
nities 
that 
need 
distributed 
or 
microgrid connections to them from 
Alaska to Puerto Rico. 
Of course, storage is a key enabling 
technology for a low-carbon, modern 
grid that will help us achieve our emis-
sion reductions and address climate 
change all while keeping energy reli-
able and affordable. Our bill builds on 
DOE’s existing energy storage R&D ef-
forts but with additional focus on ad-
vancing long-duration energy storage 
technologies and with a fivefold in-
crease in authorizations from current 
levels. 
The bill will also help to shore up our 
supply chain of critical minerals be-
cause we are currently depending on 
imports from other countries—namely 
China—for many of the mineral com-
modities required to manufacture ev-
eryday items like our phones, security 
assets like satellites, and emissions-re-
ducing technology like electric vehi-
cles and wind turbines. 
It is important to strike the right 
balance between supply chain concerns 
and environmental stewardship, and I 
appreciate Senator MURKOWSKI work-
ing with me to remove a provision that 
was concerning to some in our caucus 
and outside groups. 
Of course, the energy package also 
has a robust energy efficiency title 
that would promote efficiency in com-
mercial and public buildings, homes, 
industry, and the Federal Government. 
Energy efficiency really is the low- 
hanging fruit, and 40 percent of the Na-
tion’s energy is consumed in buildings. 
I will repeat that again—40 percent of 
the Nation’s energy is consumed in 
buildings. The Department of Energy 
estimates 
that 
efficiency 
improve-
ments can save U.S. consumers and 
businesses 741,000 gigawatt hours of 
electricity between 2016 and 2035, which 
is equal to 16 percent of electricity use 
in 2035. We can reduce the amount of 
demand by 16 percent while not deter-
ring quality of life. 
Multiple studies have shown that en-
ergy efficiency is cheaper than invest-
ing in any other type of new genera-
tion. It is truly the cheapest kilowatt. 
It is also readily available. There are 
lots of opportunities to improve effi-
ciencies in buildings, industry, and 
transportation. 
These investments in policy changes 
can and will have a real, positive im-
pact on the lives of everyday Ameri-
cans while saving both energy and 
money. I call that a win-win, which we 
don’t have many of. 
I hope we have the opportunity to 
vote on an amendment to add vol-
untary building codes back into the ef-
ficiency title of this bill, both to help

consumers save on energy bills and to 
really advance carbon savings. 
Finally, the electric grid is under-
going a rapid transformation. It is be-
coming more complex, more flexible, 
and more diverse in terms of energy re-
sources. That means we have to con-
tinue focusing on shoring up our vul-
nerabilities and anticipating future 
weaknesses in the ever-changing envi-
ronment. 
Our bill supports investments in pro-
grams that are of vital importance to 
securing and protecting our critical en-
ergy infrastructure. As I said before, 
this bill represents a critical step in 
the right direction. I believe this pack-
age is well balanced with many of my 
colleagues’ priorities on both sides of 
the aisle. It is truly a bipartisan bill. It 
represents a true effort. I thank Chair-
man MURKOWSKI and the other mem-
bers of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee for their work over 
the last 14 months to provide the basis 
of this package. 
I encourage my fellow Members to 
vote yes today, and I look forward to 
working with you this week on this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
here we are; we have successfully voted 
to proceed to S. 2657, which is our vehi-
cle for the American Energy Innova-
tion Act. We are now at the point that 
many of us have been waiting for for 
some time; that is, the opportunity to 
debate, to offer amendments, and to 
pass this measure, hopefully on a 
strong bipartisan basis. 
I want to encourage all Members to 
look at the bill that is now before us 
and to ask those questions and look at 
how, with this update to our energy 
policies, we will be moving forward 
with innovation; we will be moving for-
ward with energy security, grid mod-
ernization, cyber security, workforce 
security. We are at a good place this 
evening. 
As I mentioned in my very brief re-
marks before the vote, it has now been 
more than 12 years—more than a dozen 
years—since Congress enacted com-
prehensive legislation to update our 
energy laws. When you think about 
what has happened in a time period of 
a dozen years—12 years ago, we didn’t 
have iPads. Twelve years ago we 
weren’t even thinking about this shale 
revolution and what that would mean 
to America, turning us into an energy 
superpower. Over the course of 12 
years, the costs of renewable resources 
have come down dramatically. New 
technologies are emerging. 
What hasn’t kept pace are our poli-
cies. When they don’t keep pace, we 
miss out on opportunities to further 
our energy leadership, and we are fail-
ing to adequately address what I think 
are some very significant challenges. 
That is why the innovation package 
that Senator MANCHIN and I have put 
forward is so important at this time. 
What we are seeking to do is to mod-
ernize our energy laws to ensure that 
we remain a global energy leader. We 
seek to keep energy affordable, to 
strengthen our security, and to in-
crease our competitiveness. We do all 
of this while making our energy clean-
er and cleaner, to protect the environ-
ment and to reduce the impacts of cli-
mate change. Within this measure— 
this 
American 
Energy 
Innovation 
Act—we have included more than 50 re-
lated measures that reflect the prior-
ities of more than 60 different Sen-
ators. 
What we have done is gone through 
this committee process, and, as I men-
tioned, it has been a very robust, very 
thorough committee process. We have 
arranged these 50-some-odd measures 
into two titles. The first is focused on 
technological innovation, and the sec-
ond title is focused on security and 
workforce development. 
Starting with the first title, which is 
innovation, we really start with the 
first fuel. First fuel is energy effi-
ciency, which has tremendous poten-
tial to lower energy bills and to meet 
growing demand. We certainly know 
and understand that in a place like 
Alaska, a cold State. It helps our fami-
lies, our businesses, and the environ-
ment alike when we can be more effi-
cient in our energy consumption. 
I think we recognize that efficiency 
is often the easiest and often the 
cheapest option. That is why, within 
our bill, we take steps—reasonable 
steps—to improve the efficiency of ev-
erything from schools to data centers. 
I mentioned also that we will renew 
vital programs like Weatherization As-
sistance. Again, that is so key to so 
many in States that are cold or very 
warm in the summertime. 
The second subtitle in the bill is fo-
cused on renewable energy. When you 
think about what has happened in the

March 2, 2020 
energy sector in a 12-year period, the 
progress we have made with renewable 
energy is remarkable. With this provi-
sion, we focus on resources like wind, 
solar, geothermal, hydropower, marine, 
and hydrokinetic energy, which offer 
the potential of virtually unlimited en-
ergy. Again, as I mentioned, the costs 
of these technologies have come down 
in recent years. What we aim to do 
with our bill is to keep that going so 
that as we make our energy cleaner 
and more renewable, it is also more af-
fordable. 
The third subtitle in the innovation 
package focuses on energy storage. We 
talk a lot about energy storage, and 
folks look at that as being the holy 
grail. It really is critical to over-
coming the variability of certain re-
newable resources. 
I want to recognize a colleague, my 
friend here, Senator COLLINS, from the 
State of Maine. She has been a real 
leader on this issue. We have taken her 
legislation and called it the Better En-
ergy Storage Act, the BEST Act. We 
took the BEST Act and included four 
other bipartisan bills, all focused on 
storage, to advance these technologies. 
Another subtitle within the innova-
tion space is carbon capture, utiliza-
tion, and storage—technologies that 
reduce, and even eliminate, greenhouse 
gas emissions from coal and natural 
gas plants. Within this subtitle, we re-
flect both the EFFECT Act, which was 
sponsored by Senator MANCHIN, as well 
as the LEADING Act from Senators 
CORNYN and CASSIDY, and this will help 
us build on the work that Congress has 
done to promote CCUS through the Tax 
Code. 
Another area of great focus within 
the bill is nuclear energy, which is 
clearly our largest source of emissions- 
free energy. Here in this country, we 
created nuclear energy. American inge-
nuity created nuclear energy, but con-
ventional reactors are closing. What 
has happened is we have ceded our 
global leadership in recent decades. 
Through my Nuclear Energy Leader-
ship Act, called NELA, the Nuclear En-
ergy Renewal Act from Senator COONS, 
as well as the Integrated Energy Sys-
tems Act from Senator RISCH, we seek 
to restore that leadership for next-gen-
eration reactor concepts. 
We 
also 
support 
innovation 
and 
smart manufacturing for industrial and 
vehicle technologies, which will help 
create good jobs in America’s heart-
land. These are some of the toughest 
sectors for emissions reductions. So in 
this space, particularly, innovation is 
really key. 
I want to thank our colleague from 
Rhode Island, Senator WHITEHOUSE, 
who just left the floor, for his leader-
ship on the Clean Industrial Tech-
nologies Act. 
The last part of our first title will 
provide updated direction and author-
ity to the Department of Energy, 
which is really at the heart of Federal 
efforts to promote energy innovation. 
To give a couple of examples here, we 
renew the popular ARPA-E program, 
and we improve the Office of Tech-
nology Transitions. 
Then the second title of the bill is 
more broadly focused on security and 
workforce development. We start off 
with focusing on supply chain issues as 
they relate to minerals themselves. I 
have included the American Mineral 
Security Act, which recognizes that 
our foreign mineral dependence is real-
ly our Achilles’ heel. Right now in the 
United States, we import at least 50 
percent of 46 minerals, including 100 
percent of 17 of them. 
What we have seen is a foreign de-
pendence that has grown significantly 
over the recent years. What we seek to 
do is to take some real steps to reverse 
that and rebuild our domestic supply 
chain. If we can do that, everyone from 
our military to our manufacturers will 
benefit. 
When we think about the securities 
space, we also have to focus on cyber 
security. We all understand a success-
ful cyber attack against our Nation’s 
critical infrastructure, including the 
electric grid, could have devastating 
and 
far-reaching 
consequences. 
To 
guard against that, we provide new 
mechanisms and incentives to protect 
our cyber security and modernize the 
domestic grid. 
Then again, when we think about se-
curity, we think about economic secu-
rity through good jobs. We recognize 
the importance of a well-trained, high-
ly skilled workforce. That is essential 
to our ability to produce energy, to de-
velop clean technologies, rebuild our 
domestic supply chain, and ultimately 
remain a global energy superpower. 
To address workforce challenges, we 
have incorporated several bills from 
colleagues that will meet the needs of 
companies and our national labs alike. 
We are going to focus almost all of the 
debate on title I, ‘‘Innovation,’’ and 
title II, ‘‘Security.’’ 
Title III is really my favorite. It is 
the last title. We call it ‘‘Cleaning up 
the Code.’’ That is not very fancy, but 
we are working to repeal a number of 
sections of law that are either dupli-
cated by the American Energy Innova-
tion Act or simply outdated. We don’t 
do this often enough. We need to take 
the old stuff off the books. There are 
reports that are no longer required 
that are parts of provisions of law that 
are just not in place; yet somebody out 
there still does the reports because we 
haven’t taken them off the books. Let’s 
get rid of things that are redundant or 
outdated. 
We repeal old studies. One of the 
items that we repeal is a requirement 
for motorists to purchase at least $5 
worth of gas; we actually have on the 
books a requirement that motorists 
have to purchase at least $5 when you 
go to the fuel tank. We are getting rid 
of that. 
We have some other provisions in 
there that we believe are no longer 
needed. We did this very carefully. It 
was not just quickly going through 
things. We checked with the Depart-
ment of Energy during both the last 
administration and this one to ensure 
they agree these are outdated or dupli-
cative. 
As proud as I am of the substance of 
our innovation package, I am equally 
proud of the process that we followed 
to put it together. I mentioned earlier 
that, on the Energy Committee, we de-
veloped somewhat of a reputation for 
doing things the old-fashioned way, 
through regular orders, spending some 
time in committee, and really trying 
to build consensus products so that, 
when we can come to the floor, we have 
measures that enjoy broad support 
from both sides of the aisle. 
I think our bill is a textbook example 
of the benefits of working together 
across the aisle in a regular order proc-
ess. It is not quick to do it this way. 
This is the result of a full year’s worth 
of hearings, business meetings, and bi-
partisan negotiations. I think that it 
shows what is possible when we focus 
on what most of us agree on, rather 
than those things that will serve to di-
vide us. 
I am certainly aware that, even with 
the strong vote that we just had to 
move to proceed to this bill, not all 
Members plan to support the measure. 
Some think it has gone too far; others 
think it doesn’t do enough. I heard 
from Members who want to add energy 
tax provisions. I will have an oppor-
tunity to have that discussion, but I 
will remind colleagues that, when we 
originate here in the Senate—if there 
are any tax measures—that results in a 
blue slip from the House and effec-
tively kills our bill. This is too good a 
bill to kill. 
A few would like to reduce its au-
thorization levels, while others would 
have us multiply them by 10 times. I 
think by doing either of this, what you 
lose is the balance that we have 
worked very hard to achieve with this. 
Last point I am going to raise—and 
just very briefly because I will have 
plenty of time on the floor and I see we 
have colleagues here. One criticism I 
find disappointing is that we are not 
doing enough in this bill to tackle cli-
mate change. I think what is impor-
tant for Members to know is this pack-
age, without question, is a good step, a 
strong step, a necessary step in the 
right direction to continue to reduce 
our Nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
When you say we need to tackle cli-
mate change, you can’t get there with-
out innovation. You can’t get there 
without technology. That is exactly 
what this bill promotes. To say that 
perhaps we should not pass a good bill 
because it doesn’t go far enough, in my 
view, is a mistake that will result in 
absolutely nothing happening, and that 
is not good for anybody. 
I am excited to be here. I am proud to 
be managing a strong bill with the Sen-
ator from West Virginia. It is a strong 
bill that will benefit our economy, our 
security, our competitiveness, and our 
environment. I want to thank all the

Members who have contributed to it 
and who will help us move this for-
ward. I think we have a lot to be proud 
of. I hope that we will have a produc-
tive week in front of us as we begin to 
work through possible amendments. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I applaud 
the work of Senator MURKOWSKI, who is 
perhaps uniquely qualified here to find 
ways of doing bipartisan work. I ap-
plaud her for her efforts on this bill 
and other things. 
HOUSING 
Mr. President, for too many people, 
hard work isn’t paying off. Even people 
with supposedly middle-class jobs don’t 
feel stable. Wages are flat, the cost of 
everything is up: healthcare, childcare, 
college, prescription drugs, and espe-
cially housing. When you love this 
country, you fight for the people who 
make it work. You fight for dignity of 
work, but you can’t talk about dignity 
of work without tackling the biggest 
item in most family’s budget: housing. 
Dignity of work means living with 
dignity, whether you write a rent 
check or pay a mortgage, whether you 
are saving for a down payment or just 
looking for a safe place to lay down 
your head at night, whether you live in 
a city or a suburb, in Hamilton County 
where my colleague, Senator PORTMAN, 
who is in the Chamber, lives, in Rich-
land County, where I grew up, a me-
dium-sized city or a rural community. 
Fundamentally, we all pretty much 
want the same thing: a place that is 
safe in a community where we care 
about, where we can get to work and 
our children have a chance to have a 
good school with room for our family, 
whether that is three kids, an aging 
parent, or beloved pet—in our case, our 
dogs Franklin and Walter. You should 
get to define what home looks like for 
you. You should be able to find it. You 
should be able to afford it without crip-
pling stress every single month when 
the rent check is due or when your 
mortgage payment is due. 
People feel like that is out of reach, 
even when they work hard and do ev-
erything right. Right now, a quarter of 
renters, one out of four renters, spend 
more than half their income on hous-
ing. Think of that. One out of four 
renters pay more than half of their in-
come on housing. If one thing goes 
wrong in their life—their car breaks 
down, their child gets sick, they get 
laid off from work for 1 week, they 
need to repair the roof—one thing goes 
wrong and their life turns upside down. 
Seven out of the ten fastest growing 
jobs in this country don’t pay enough 
for a two-bedroom apartment. We know 
housing is central to every aspect of 
family’s lives. 
Matthew Desmond is the author of 
‘‘Evicted,’’ a book I have spoken about 
on this floor in the past and to people 
all over my State and around the coun-
try. 
Matthew 
Desmond’s 
book 
is 
‘‘Evicted.’’ I asked him to come in. I 
bought his book and brought in a num-
ber of Senators to listen to him. When 
inscribing his book, he wrote: ‘‘Home 
equals life.’’ If you don’t have a decent, 
safe, clean, affordable place to live, 
your life is so often turned upside 
down. The housing crisis affects dif-
ferent families in different ways, but it 
touches pretty much everyone. 
A safe, stable home is the foundation 
for opportunity. It determines where 
your kids go to school. It determines 
how far you have to travel to get to 
work. It determines where you go shop-
ping. It determines whether you feel 
safe walking around at night. 
We know where you live, maybe most 
importantly, affects the quality of 
your healthcare. It affects your edu-
cation, your job opportunities—where 
you live affects your life expectancy. 
Housing stress affects people with all 
kinds of jobs in all parts of the coun-
try. That is why I have been holding 
roundtables all over my State, begin-
ning over the past 2 weeks, to talk 
with Ohioans about their struggle with 
housing and what we can do to make it 
easier for everyone to find and afford a 
home. 
So far, I have done roundtables in To-
ledo and Youngstown, Western Ohio, 
and Eastern Ohio. I heard from Ohioans 
about the challenges that too many 
people face. We heard about how inter-
connected housing is with other issues 
in people’s lives. We heard about wages 
that don’t keep up with the cost of liv-
ing, how housing instability can affect 
your stress levels and your health, and 
how hard it can be to get financing to 
buy a house or start a business in 
neighborhoods that have been left be-
hind. 
In Youngstown and Toledo, we heard 
about the power shady landlords have 
on tenants and predatory lease-to-own 
land contracts. People also talked 
about how up-front costs aren’t just an 
issue about the down payment you 
make on buying a home to get a mort-
gage, but if you rent, you often have to 
have the first month’s rent, last 
month’s rent, and a security deposit. 
That could be a huge obstacle to so 
many moderate and low-income fami-
lies. 
Forty percent—this number is stun-
ning—40 percent of Americans say they 
can’t come up with $400 in an emer-
gency. Forty percent of Americans 
can’t come up with $400 in emergency. 
When it is that hard for so many people 
to save, a deposit could seem just im-
possible. 
We can’t untangle many of these 
issues from the legacy of redlining and 
decades of bad public policy decisions 
by Members, I would acknowledge, 
from both parties, at all levels of gov-
ernment that have systemically denied 
people of color the ability to choose 
where they live and build wealth for 
homeownership. 
More than half of African Americans 
and Latino renters are spending more 
than 30 percent of their income on 
housing. More than half of people of 
color spend 30 percent or more on their 
housing, making them much more like-
ly to have a high housing cost burdens 
than White seniors have had. That 
means Black and Latino families have 
less to spend on healthcare, less to 
spent on food, less to spend on trans-
portation. It is not just about dif-
ferences in income, which are all very 
real. 
More than 50 years after we passed 
the Fair Housing Act to prohibit dis-
crimination in housing, African Ameri-
cans make up 13 percent of the popu-
lation, and 21 percent of the people ex-
periencing poverty in this country are 
African American, but 40 percent of the 
people experiencing homelessness are 
African American. 
Think about that. There are 21 per-
cent of people who are experiencing 
poverty, but there are 40 percent of 
people who are experiencing homeless-
ness. That tells you this isn’t just 
about income. We have talked to peo-
ple who are homeless, but none of us 
gets out as much as we should, as 
President Lincoln said, to get our pub-
lic opinion bath. We don’t talk to peo-
ple like that enough, but when we do, 
we learn that so many people who are 
homeless have jobs. The jobs don’t pay 
much, and they may be part time. Peo-
ple may also cobble together two jobs, 
but they are still homeless. 
We see the same thing when we look 
at homeownership. The African-Amer-
ican homeownership rate is 30 percent 
below the White homeownership rate. 
Analysts have tried to explain this 
with income and education, but that 
doesn’t tell the whole story. Something 
more troubling is going on. With every-
thing else being equal, similarly situ-
ated African Americans are less likely 
to own homes than their similarly situ-
ated White counterparts. That is a leg-
acy of redlining, and that is a legacy of 
racial exclusion at work. It may be in 
Arkansas, and it may be in Ohio. It is 
all over this country. 
From 1934 through 1962—get this—98 
percent of all FHA mortgages went to 
White homeowners. We were a country 
that 
was, 
probably, 
85–87 
percent 
White, but 90 percent of all FHA mort-
gages went to White homeowners. That 
is not just a problem of the past. Hous-
ing is how people build wealth for gen-
erations. Yet, with there being millions 
of families struggling to afford hous-
ing, with the massive disparities and 
access to housing, this administration 
is turning its back on families, commu-
nities, and communities of color. 
For 3 years, President Trump has 
been trying to undermine the Fair 
Housing Act of 1968. I spoke about this 
on the floor last week with MITT ROM-
NEY, the Senator from Utah. Senator 
ROMNEY’s father was President Nixon’s 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment, and he worked very hard to 
implement the Fair Housing Act. He 
made a lot of progress in 1969 and 1970, 
but so much of that progress is now 
being scaled back. That landmark civil 
rights law made discrimination of the

sale, rental, and financing of housing 
illegal for the first time. It was sup-
posed to set us on the path of being a 
country in which everyone could find a 
safe, stable home—regardless of one’s 
gender and regardless of one’s race— 
and have access to opportunity. 
Yet, instead of getting us closer, the

is 
making 
things worse. It is trying to make it 
harder to root out policies and prac-
tices that have a hidden discriminatory 
effect on people by its cutting the dec-
ades-old disparate impact standard. 
The administration is rolling back the 
2015 HUD rule that would have finally 
implemented the Fair Housing Act’s 
requirement that we affirmatively fur-
ther fair housing throughout our com-
munities. 
President Trump’s budget will only 
make the affordable housing crisis 
worse for families who are struggling 
in every community in this country. 
The administration would eliminate 
the funds that communities use to cre-
ate and preserve affordable housing and 
that make homeownership possible for 
working families. The Community De-
velopment Block Grant is an example, 
as is the HOME Investment Partner-
ship Program. 
The administration wants to cut the 
already insufficient Federal rental as-
sistance we have. It wants to get rid of 
the funding for the housing trust fund 
and capital magnet fund—even though 
this funding comes from the GSEs, the 
government-sponsored enterprises, and 
not the Federal budget—to make it 
still harder to build homes and apart-
ments that people can actually afford. 
To add insult to injury, the Trump 
administration proposes to make mort-
gages more expensive for working fam-
ilies in order to reduce the deficit that 
it created. We know we have trillion- 
dollar deficits now, even in times of 
growth with the economy, because of 
the tax cut that went overwhelmingly 
to the rich. The administration made 
these mortgages more expensive for 
working families in order to reduce the 
deficit it created and to supposedly 
level the playing field for Wall Street, 
as if Wall Street doesn’t have enough 
advantages without our continuing to 
shovel money to it. 
We need to fight back. Any economic 
policy that doesn’t put housing front 
and center ignores a family’s biggest 
expense and biggest need. We see hous-
ing problems in Appalachian Ohio or in 
Toledo or in big coastal cities or in 
small towns. It is clear this is a na-
tional problem that needs a national 
response. 
I 
will 
keep 
hosting 
roundtables 
around Ohio so as to hear directly from 
Ohioans about the struggles they face. 
I invite Ohioans to go to my website, 
Brown.senate.gov, to share their sto-
ries about housing. They can do it with 
their names attached, or they can do it 
anonymously, but we value these sto-
ries. We have already gotten hundreds 
just out of these two roundtables, and 
with 
the 
attention 
around 
the 
roundtables, we have gotten hundreds 
of many heartbreaking stories and in-
structive stories and ideas for changes. 
We need to hear your struggles, and 
we need to hear your ideas. 
Congress cannot ignore these chal-
lenges. Whether people are in small 
towns or big cities, we cannot just let 
the administration take away the tools 
that we have and that we have used for 
years to try to make this better and to 
make people’s lives better. If we want 
to make this country work better for 
everyone, we cannot shrink from these 
challenges. When work has dignity and 
when people live their lives with dig-
nity, everyone can find and afford a 
safe place to call home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The Senator from Ohio. 
S. 2657 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor to talk about the leg-
islation that is now before this body. 
We just passed the motion to proceed 
to the energy legislation, and we just 
heard about the legislation from my 
colleague from Alaska and the Pre-
siding Officer’s colleague from Alaska: 
Senator MURKOWSKI, who chairs the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. The legislation is a good pack-
age. 
As she said very well, it both helps in 
terms of the economy and jobs and in 
terms 
of 
the 
environment. 
Who 
wouldn’t be for that? It also has a 
whole series of proposals with which to 
do it. The ones I am going to talk 
about tonight are the energy efficiency 
proposals that she talked about. In par-
ticular, I am going to talk about a con-
cern I have that the legislation that 
was offered tonight took out part of 
our energy-efficiency package, which 
we hope to add later by amendment, 
but I want to talk about why it is so 
important to add it back in. 
The legislation on energy efficiency 
is something I have introduced with 
Senator SHAHEEN, of the great State of 
New Hampshire, for 9 years now, going 
back to 2011. Some of it has gotten 
passed over time, but most of it has 
not, so we are, once again, bringing it 
up. The legislation is entitled the En-
ergy Savings and Industrial Competi-
tiveness Act, which is why we com-
monly call it Portman-Shaheen, be-
cause it is shorter. 
Our legislation has been voted on by 
this body before. Back in 2016, it passed 
the U.S. Senate. It has also passed out 
of the Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee five separate times 
with bipartisan votes. In 2016, the vote 
was 85 to 12. Again, it was part of a 
larger package at that time. 
There is a reason this legislation has 
received such broad, bipartisan support 
over the years. It lowers energy bills, 
which is a good thing. It reduces emis-
sions, and it creates new jobs. It does it 
all without putting any new mandates 
on the private sector. It provides incen-
tives but not mandates, and that is 
great news for the working families 
and businesses, large and small, that I 
represent. 
It accomplishes all this by improving 
energy efficiency in three key sectors. 
One is buildings, commercial buildings 
and residential buildings. The second is 
in the manufacturing sector, the indus-
trial sector, of our economy. Then the 
third is with regard to our U.S. Govern-
ment. 
Residential and commercial build-
ings, by the way, account for, roughly, 
40 percent of the total U.S. energy con-
sumption, which is why it is so impor-
tant we have these sections with re-
gard to buildings. 
With regard to our industry sector, 
manufacturers are excited about this 
legislation because it makes them not 
just more efficient in terms of energy, 
but it makes them more competitive 
globally. That is why the Chamber of 
Commerce and the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers and other groups 
are strongly supportive of the legisla-
tion, as are well over 100 businesses. 
The Federal Government’s part of 
this bill is also important. Guess what 
entity uses the most energy in this 
country—the Federal Government. It is 
the No. 1 consumer of energy in the 
United States. We think it is probably 
the No. 1 consumer in the world. This 
may not surprise you, but it is not ter-
ribly efficient. Our Federal Govern-
ment sometimes preaches to the rest of 
us to be efficient, but our own Federal 
Government is lacking in that. 
So this legislation focuses on those 
three areas and makes a real dif-
ference. It moves the needle, as they 
say. It makes smart improvements to 
energy efficiency across these sectors. 
A recent analysis of Portman-Sha-
heen found that, over the lifetime of 
the legislation, the bill will save con-
sumers $51 billion on their energy bills. 
It will result in an energy savings that 
is equivalent to the total energy use of 
all U.S. industry in 1 year, and it will 
reduce the carbon dioxide emissions— 
these are CO2 emissions—by the equiv-
alent of taking nearly 4 million cars off 
the road every single year until 2050. 
As Senator MURKOWSKI said very well 
earlier today, this is about reducing 
emissions. For those who are concerned 
about climate change and who want to 
reduce emissions, energy efficiency is a 
great way to do it—and, by the way, by 
creating jobs not eliminating jobs. Pre-
vious studies have shown that our leg-
islation will also add more jobs to the 
economy. As I say, 100,000 jobs is our 
estimate. 
I must tell you that I am supportive 
of the package, and I am supportive of 
what Senator MURKOWSKI said tonight. 
My disappointment is that the under-
lying legislation we are debating does 
not include two provisions in the 
Portman-Shaheen 
legislation. 
Those 
two provisions are two of the most im-
portant ones, for they result in the en-
ergy savings I talked about, in the ad-
ditional jobs I talked about, and in the 
savings to the taxpayers I talked 
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1250 
March 2, 2020 
The first one is what is known as the 
SAVE Act. Now, the SAVE Act allows 
the energy savings of an energy-effi-
cient home to be considered when de-
termining the loan amount that a 
home buyer is qualified for when he 
goes to get a mortgage. In other words, 
it helps to immediately offset the cost 
of a more energy-efficient home by rec-
ognizing the reduced energy bill, which 
is often the second biggest expense a 
homeowner will incur after the mort-
gage payment. 
This bipartisan legislation was first 
authored by our friend and former col-
league Johnny Isakson, along with 
Senator MICHAEL BENNET, of Colorado. 
As a real estate person himself, Johnny 
championed this legislation over many 
years, and I thank him for his efforts. 
It is in our Portman-Shaheen bill. I 
was pleased to work with Senators 
Isakson and BENNET and include it in 
Portman-Shaheen. I am sorry it is not 
part of the energy bill tonight, but it is 
not the only important provision that 
has missed the boat on this package. 
Another important section of my en-
ergy-efficiency legislation that has 
been left out of the energy bill is 
known as the building codes section. 
This section focuses on providing best 
practices on how to make homes more 
energy efficient. We know that one of 
the most effective ways to ensure that 
a homeowner’s energy bills are afford-
able is to build a home that is more en-
ergy efficient to begin with. 
It is important to note at the outset 
that the building codes we are talking 
about tonight are and will remain 
under this legislation as voluntary. 
You are going to hear that a lot to-
night. There are no mandates in this 
legislation of any kind for new homes. 
It is up to States, local governments, 
and Tribes to adopt the building codes 
on their own that they deem fit for 
their communities. 
In fact, some States have building 
energy codes. Some States don’t. Some 
States adopt part of what is called the 
model code, which we will talk about 
in a minute, and some States have no 
model code at all that they are going 
to adopt. In my home State of Ohio, for 
example, we have adopted parts of the 
2009 model building energy code and 
parts of the 2012 model building energy 
code. So, instead of mandates or a 
heavy-handed 
government 
approach, 
this provision we are talking about is 
an 
incentive-based, 
opt-in 
program 
that is open, transparent, and cost-ef-
fective. 
It is not that the mandates haven’t 
been tried before. Mandated building 
energy codes and mandated energy sav-
ings were included as part of the 2009 
energy bill that passed out of the 
House of Representatives. There was 
even legislation introduced today over 
in the House that would impose man-
dates. Our legislation does not. It takes 
a much more commonsense approach, 
in my view, and leaves it up to the 
States to adopt which, if any, of the 
model building codes work best for 
them. 
Some of you might not know that 
these model building codes for com-
mercial and residential buildings are 
developed and updated not through our 
government 
but 
through 
an 
inde-
pendent organization outside of the 
Federal Government. For residential 
buildings codes, it is called the Inter-
national Code Council, or the ICC. 
Every 3 years, this group, the ICC, con-
ducts a process to update the residen-
tial model building energy code. Every 
3 years, it does it. 
During that process, many stake-
holders, including industry, builders, 
developers, State code officials, and 
the Department of Energy, can all 
weigh in with proposals or amend-
ments. Then they vote to approve the 
inclusion of the proposals in the up-
dated code. They all have a vote, in-
cluding home builders. 
Today, the Department of Energy 
plays a role in the code development 
process just like other stakeholders. It 
has general authorities to offer and 
support proposals and to vote on the 
proposals. It has the authority to set 
targets to reach a certain percentage of 
energy savings during a code update. 
Since 1992, the DOE has had the au-
thority to provide technical assistance 
and funding for States, local govern-
ments, and Tribes that want to update 
their building codes. 
So that is the current practice. It is 
not mandatory. The DOE can set tar-
gets and can provide technical assist-
ance. However, there have been con-
cerns from some stakeholders that the 
DOE has not been transparent enough 
or has not adequately considered the 
costs of proposals and targets. That is 
why, in this legislation, in addition to 
codifying much of what the DOE was 
already doing, our legislation estab-
lishes a rulemaking process that re-
quires, for the first time, the DOE to 
work with States, Tribes, local govern-
ments, and other interested stake-
holders to set these energy savings tar-
gets in advance of the model building 
code update. We require the DOE to do 
that. 
The purpose of the target is to set an 
energy savings percentage improve-
ment from one model code to the next. 
It is intended to be a benchmark for 
stakeholders to consider when pro-
posing, 
supporting, 
and 
voting 
on 
amendments, but it is not mandatory. 
In response to stakeholders’ concerns 
that the target might not be cost effec-
tive—in other words, that DOE would 
establish a target that wasn’t cost ef-
fective for homebuilders, as an exam-
ple—or that it wasn’t transparent and 
that what they were doing wasn’t open, 
our bill also requires DOE to publish 
its methodology and provide a ‘‘return 
on investment’’ analysis, not pre-
viously required, and the estimated 
cost and savings as a result of the tar-
get. 
So we are forcing DOE to do much 
more than they do now—to be more 
transparent, to look at the cost benefit 
here, and to come up with a cost-effec-
tive analysis. 
Then, at the end of the day, the tar-
get itself is nonbinding on the model 
code process. DOE makes a determina-
tion on whether the target was met, 
and then this group, the ICC, sends 
their options, which they can choose to 
adopt in order to meet the target. They 
do not have to accept the changes, nor 
does this model code have to meet the 
target. So it is not mandatory even at 
that stage. They set a target, but it is 
not mandatory for the ICC to adopt it. 
It is also important to again note 
that the proposed model building code 
at the end that is ultimately published 
by the ICC is not an automatic man-
date for new buildings. States are en-
couraged to take a look at the new pro-
posed code and to let DOE know that 
they have considered the proposed code 
and determined whether to adopt it or 
not. Again, some States adopt it, and 
some States don’t. 
So, as you can see, this whole process 
is one where the recommendation is 
made, but it is not mandated. 
Just as in the current law today, our 
bill authorizes DOE to provide funding 
and technical assistance to States to 
incentivize them to update their code. 
But, ultimately, the updated code and 
whether the States want to consider 
the updated model code or not is com-
pletely nonbinding and voluntary. 
I have heard concerns that our legis-
lation 
will 
make 
new 
homes 
unaffordable. However, DOE’s analysis 
found that, for example, if the 2015 code 
was fully adopted—so that was the 2015 
code we talked about earlier that Ohio 
has partly adopted—it would result in 
a 33-percent reduction in energy use for 
that home and cost $2,787 per new home 
compared to the 2006 code. So, remem-
ber, this is a recent model code, 2015. 
They do it every 3 years. If it had been 
fully adopted, it would result in a 33- 
percent reduction in energy use for 
that family, and yet only an additional 
cost of $2,787, compared to the previous 
code. 
We also know that these upfront 
costs are typically financed entirely by 
these energy savings through the life of 
the mortgage, which is typically 30 
years. So you know there is a little 
more upfront cost, but a 33-percent re-
duction in energy use would more than 
finance that over the time that the 
person owned the home. 
So, ultimately, our legislation is 
going to ensure that energy efficiency 
features of a home will continue to 
save homeowners money throughout 
the life of the building. 
This incentive-based approached to 
improving energy efficiency in new 
buildings has bipartisan support from a 
broad group of stakeholders. In par-
ticular, my colleagues on this side of 
the aisle support an incentive-based ap-
proach rather than a mandated ap-
proach. 
Our legislation has the support of the 
National Association of Manufacturers, 
the American Chemistry Council, and 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It has 
the support of commercial and real es-
tate developers, like BOMA and the

Real Estate Roundtable. It has the sup-
port from efficiency advocates and the 
environmental community, like the Al-
liance to Save Energy, the ACEEE, 
NRDC, and the BlueGreen Alliance. 
There is not a lot in Washington, DC, 
these days that has that broad group of 
stakeholders—strange bedfellows, you 
might say—but this bill does because 
what we do here makes sense. It 
doesn’t take a heavy-handed govern-
ment approach, but it takes an incen-
tive-based approach, not mandated but 
providing the information so States, 
localities, and communities can make 
their own decision and can help to en-
sure that the best practices out there 
in energy efficiency are known, and 
where people want to use it, they can 
use it. 
If my colleagues are serious about 
both protecting the environment and 
growing the economy and increasing 
jobs, I believe this is the right legisla-
tion for them and that the voluntary 
business code language in the energy 
bill has to be included. 
So I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to help us with regard to an 
amendment we plan to offer later in

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL 
WILSON A. SHOFFNER 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor MG Wilson A. Shoffner, 
commanding general of the U.S. Army 
Fires Center of Excellence and Fort 
Sill, OK. Major General Shoffner is one 
of our Nation’s finest military officers. 
Major General Shoffner will relinquish 
command and conduct his retirement 
ceremony on 6 March 2020, bringing to 
a close 32 years of distinguished service 
to our great Nation. 
In 1988, Major General Shoffner com-
missioned as a second lieutenant of 
field artillery upon graduation from 
the U.S. Military Academy at West 
Point. He commanded units at every 
echelon, from platoon to the Fires Cen-
ter of Excellence, with duty in Saudi 
Arabia, Germany, Iraq, Afghanistan, 
and the United States. As a young offi-
cer, Major General Shoffner deployed 
with the 1st Cavalry Division in sup-
port of OPERATION DESERT STORM. 
Major General Shoffner commanded 
2nd Battalion, 319th Field Artillery 
Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division 
during OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM. 
Later, he served as deputy chief of 
staff, communications, Resolute Sup-
port Mission, North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, 
during 
OPERATION 
FREEDOM’S SENTINEL in Afghani-
stan. 
As a general officer, Major General 
Shoffner served as the deputy chief of 
staff, G–3/5/7, for the Army’s Training 
and Doctrine Command. He served as 
the director of the Army’s Talent Man-
agement Task Force under the Army 
G1 and then as the director of oper-
ations for Rapid Equipment Fielding 
under the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary of the Army, Acquisition, Logis-
tics, and Technology. Major General 
Shoffner’s career culminated as the 
commanding general of the United 
States Army’s Fires Center of Excel-
lence and Fort Sill, where he helped 
forge the future of the Army’s Field 
Artillery and Air Defense Artillery 
branches. 
Major General Shoffner is an excep-
tional leader, an American patriot 
committed to our Armed Forces, our 
National Security, and our Nation, but 
most 
importantly, 
Major 
General 
Shoffner is a great man of character. It 
is for MG Al Shoffner, a soldier, leader, 
and selfless servant, whom we, with 
profound admiration and deep respect, 
pay tribute to for all he has done for 
the defense of our Nation for over three 
decades. 
We thank Major General Shoffner, 
his wife Carron, and their daughter, 
Kristin, for their dedication and sac-
rifice, and we wish them well in the 
years to come.

REFORMING 
EDUCATION 
THE 
AMERICAN 
WAY: 
STATE 
BY 
STATE, COMMUNITY BY COMMU-
NITY 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
last week Templeton Press published 
an important new book, ‘‘How to Edu-
cate an American: The Conservative 
Vision for Tomorrow’s Schools.’’edited 
by the Fordham Institute’s Michael J. 
Petrilli and Chester E. Finn, Jr., and 
published by Templeton Press. I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the preface I wrote for the 
book. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
REFORMING EDUCATION THE AMERICAN WAY: 
STATE BY STATE, COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY 
I was participating in a humdrum edu-
cators’ roundtable in Buffalo, New York, in 
1988 when ‘‘Monk’’ Malloy, president of the 
University of Notre Dame, asked this ques-
tion: ‘‘What is the purpose of a public 
school?’’ 
There was a long silence until finally Al-
bert Shanker, president of the American 
Federation of Teachers, proposed this an-
swer: ‘‘The public school was created for the 
purpose of teaching immigrant children 
reading, writing, and arithmetic and what it 
means to be an American with the hope that 
they would then go home and teach their 
parents.’’ The reason to read this book is to 
judge for yourself whether the twenty-two 
conservative luminaries who wrote its chap-
ters have produced a better answer today to 
Malloy’s question than Albert Shanker did 
thirty years ago. 
Shanker was a patriot—an old-fashioned, 
anticommunist, Hubert Humphrey—liberal 
Democrat union organizer whose parents had 
immigrated from Poland. So he and this 
book’s conservative writers agreed on one 
thing: In coeditor Chester Finn’s words, 
‘‘Schools should inculcate a solid under-
standing of and appreciation for why Amer-
ica exists and what it stands for, to transmit 
history and civics and, yes, a positive atti-
tude toward its strengths as well as a rea-
soned commitment to addressing its weak-
ness.’’ Or, in Shanker’s words, ‘‘Public 
schools played a big role in holding our na-
tion together. They brought together chil-
dren of different races, languages, religions, 
and cultures and gave them a common lan-
guage and a sense of common purpose. We 
have not outgrown our need for this; far from 
it.’’ 
Today, there is elite disdain for such 
Americanism. But this is not a popular atti-
tude. Most audiences applaud and some come 
to their feet when I say, ‘‘We should teach 
more United States history in our schools so 
our children can grow up knowing what it 
means to be an American.’’ There is bipar-
tisan support for this sentiment. After Sep-
tember 11, 2001, George W. Bush and Al Gore 
both reminded the nation that principles cre-
ate the American character—not consider-
ations of race, religion, or national origin. In 
my first address to the US Senate, I intro-
duced a bill to create summer academies for 
outstanding students and teachers of U.S. 
history. Within a day, Senator Ted Kennedy 
had rounded up nearly twenty Democratic 
cosponsors without my asking. Especially in 
today’s internet democracy, an era Peggy 
Noonan calls ‘‘The Great Estrangement,’’ 
Americans are hungry for institutions that 
unite. I suspect that most would agree that 
it would be a good idea to begin each school 
day with a student leading the Pledge of Al-
legiance and then giving his or her version of 
what it means to be an American. 
According to education historian Patricia 
Graham, ‘‘Schools in America have danced 
to different drummers through their long 
history’’—and schools have a very long his-
tory. Hunter-gatherer ‘‘play schools’’ helped 
children learn to survive. Sumerian schools 
taught scribes to help a culture survive. Dur-
ing the Agricultural and Industrial Revolu-
tions, schools taught youngsters to work and 
got them out from under their parents’ feet. 
Sociologist James Coleman said that in 
early America, schools helped parents do 
what parents could not do as well. That was 
especially true for teaching literacy. Gra-
ham says, ‘‘Now the drumbeat demands that 
all children achieve academically at a high 
level and the measure of that achievement is 
tests.’’ 
This book’s conservative writers would 
temper that drumbeat with a second great 
conservative goal—in the coeditors’ words, 
‘‘to restore character, virtue, and morality 
to the head of the education table where 
they belong.’’ This is no new thought. Plato 
said schools should create good men who act 
nobly. Thomas Jefferson believed that a de-
mocracy granting broad liberties needed in-
stitutions instilling moral restraint. But 
Yuval Levin’s essay suggests why character 
education does not rise so easily on a liberal

education wants to form the student to be 
better suited to the responsibilities of citi-
zenship. 
After embracing citizenship and character, 
the book’s authors diverge in their empha-
ses. Several show a healthy respect for 
school choice but also for its limits. There is 
a shout-out for career and technical edu-
cation. To me, Bill Bennett’s chapter is the 
most persuasive. He argues that content 
must be at the center of any conservative 
consensus on education. He reminds us that 
in the 1980s and 1990s, conservatives were 
leading a content crusade with E.D. Hirsch 
and Governors John Engler, Tommy Thomp-
son, and Jeb Bush as well as Bennett himself 
as chief architects. This movement was 
called (shall we whisper it?) ‘‘Common 
Core.’’ This state-by-state reformation of 
school standards and curricula was well un-
derway when the Obama administration 
tried to push it faster by making Common 
Core a quasi-federal mandate. Republicans 
imagined black helicopters flying. What con-
servatives had invented, many Republican 
legislators had voted into state law, and 
hundreds of thousands of classroom teachers 
in forty-five states expected they’d be teach-
ing was suddenly condemned and abandoned 
. . . by conservatives. 
This abandonment was less complete than 
it would appear. Last year, our daughter’s 
family lived with us in Tennessee while her 
home was being remodeled. She placed two 
sons in a nearby mountain elementary 
school. When the boys returned home to 
their Westchester County, New York, public 
school, I asked, ‘‘Did they have trouble ad-
justing?’’ ‘‘Nope,’’ she said. ‘‘Common Core 
here. Common Core there.’’ Many states sim-
ply renamed Common Core to avoid political 
flak and charged ahead. One advocate told 
me, ‘‘We won. But we’re not allowed to say 
so.’’ The backlash to Common Core brings 
me to the most obvious mission missing 
from this volume’s conservative agenda: 
local control of schools. America was created 
community by community. The initiative 
for American public schools was entirely at 
the local level, Marc Tucker has written. He 
termed this an ‘‘accident of localism.’’ 
I have spent much of my public life trying 
to preserve this localism. To begin with, fed-
eralism—the dispersal of central authority— 
is a crucial tenet of American liberty. Our 
revolution, after all was mostly about dis-
taste for a king. As a practical matter, my 
experience is that those governing education 
from a distance have good intentions but 
limited capacity and that schools can be 
only as good as parents, teachers, and citi-
zens in a community want them to be. The 
saga of Common Core is the greatest proof of 
this pudding. Here was a conservative cru-
sade—new rigor in what students needed to 
know—blown up by conservatives’ fear that 
Washington D.C., was forcing them to do it. 
The Common Core federal directive was piled 
on top of other dictates from Presidents Bill 
Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama 
on how to define standards, teaching, tests, 
curricula, and remedies for low-performing 
schools. Almost everyone in public schools 
became sick of Washington telling them 
what to do. So, in 2015, teacher unions and 
governors united to help Congress enact the 
‘‘Every Student Succeeds Act,’’ which the 
Wall Street Journal said was ‘‘the largest 
devolution of federal control to the states in 
a quarter century.’’ 
Now, after the rise and fall of a national 
school board, our one hundred thousand pub-
lic schools have about the same balance be-
tween federal leadership and state and local 
autonomy that existed during the George H. 
W. Bush administration. Once again, we have 
it about right. Thirty years ago, President 
Bush and the governors set the nation’s first 
national education goals and then launched 
an ‘‘America 2000’’ initiative to help states 
meet those goals by creating voluntary 
standards, voluntary tests, and start-from- 
scratch schools. This was done the hard way, 
state by state and community by commu-
nity—not by federal mandates. Today’s envi-
ronment is ripe for a revival of a content- 
based conservative consensus, or in Bill Ben-
nett’s words ‘‘a great relearning,’’ as the best 
way for our public schools to help our coun-
try get where we want it to go. But this 
time, let’s avoid the lure of federal mandates 
and do the job the American Way: state by 
state, community by community.

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT S. FRASER 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
celebrate Robert S. Fraser’s retirement 
from the Federal Government after 50 
years of faithful service to our country. 
Mr. Fraser traveled for over 40 years 
with the U.S. Air Force, both as a de-
pendent and serving on active duty. He 
attended the U.S. Air Force Academy, 
where he graduated in 1973 and received 
the Outstanding Cadet in Engineering 
Sciences. In 1993, he retired as a major 
in the U.S. Air Force and began a dis-
tinguished career at the National Secu-
rity Agency, where he received mul-
tiple 
achievements 
and 
awards. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Fraser has 
had a selfless dedication to duty and 
professionalism.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. 
PARTHASARATHY VASUDEVAN 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Dr. 
Parthasarathy 
Vasudevan, 
who 
passed away on December 31, 2019. Dr. 
Vasu’s 40 years of civic and medical 
leadership in Phillips County were in-
credibly transformative for the Arkan-
sas Delta, and his efforts reveal a re-
lentless quest to improve the quality of 
life for those around him. 
Dr. Vasu was a physician specializing 
in Urology in Helena, AR, with demand 
for his services extending beyond Phil-
lips County. His career reflected 62 
years of diverse experience spanning 
India, Boston, and the Natural State. 
Dr. Vasu grew up in India where he re-
ceived his medical degree in 1958 and 
met his wife, Kanaka Rajgopal. She ac-
companied him to the United States in 
1973 for Dr. Vasu’s residency at the 
New England Medical Center in Boston, 
and upon his completion in 1978, the 
two embarked on their final move, to 
Arkansas. 
Dr. Vasu’s medical impact was wide-
spread and included philanthropic lead-
ership in addition to his urology prac-
tice. He served as executive director of 
the Helena Health Foundation, a non-
profit organization with a mission to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
healthcare offered in Phillips County 
through grant funding. During his time 
in this role, Dr. Vasu was instrumental 
in developing the Delta Area Health 
Education Center in Helena, which be-
came the University of Arkansas for 
Medical Sciences East Regional Cam-
pus in 2013. The foundation honored Dr. 
Vasu’s sponsorship with a $4 million 
Wellness Center in his name. 
Dr. Vasu’s extensive knowledge, dedi-
cated service, and passionate nature 
were qualities not only recognized by 
his patients, but also by the civic insti-
tutions in which he participated. Orga-
nizations he was active in were the 
Helena Rotary Club, as well as the 
Phillips County Chamber of Commerce, 
among others. In recognition of his 
philanthropic involvement, Dr. Vasu 
was awarded the Paul Harris Fellow-
ship recognition by the Rotary Foun-
dation and the Channel 4 Community 
Service Award. Phillips County also 
designated August 25, 2004, as ‘‘Dr. P. 
Vasudevan Day.’’ 
Dr. Vasu was a tremendous asset to 
the Phillips County region, as well as 
the State of Arkansas. He was not just 
a doctor, but he was a mentor and a 
friend who loved politics and the Ar-
kansas Razorbacks. His devoted heart 
and helping hand touched the lives of 
many, and his deeply respected legacy 
will transcend time. I extend my heart-
felt condolences to Dr. Vasu’s loved 
ones, his patients, and Phillips County 
citizens. We pray his remarkable exam-
ple inspires many future Arkansas 
leaders.∑

RECOGNIZING THE ALEXANDER 
ROBOTICS TEAM 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, the stu-
dents on the robotics team in the small 
northwestern North Dakota town of 
Alexander set a goal at the beginning 
of this school year to win their State 
competition. Their determination and 
hard work paid off in February, and 
now the Alexander High School FIRST 
Tech Challenge Team #9963 team is 
preparing to represent North Dakota in 
the world championship competition. 
FIRST is the acronym for the For In-
spiration and Recognition of Science 
and Technology organization, which 
plans the annual competitions between 
schools. There, the students build and 
program robots to perform challenging 
tasks and then compete with other 
teams. 
Robotics competition is growing in 
popularity in schools because it pro-
vides an ideal opportunity for young 
people to apply their knowledge of 
STEM subjects. It also teaches valu-
able life skills like communication, 
creativity, and collaboration and opens 
up countless doors of opportunity for 
the future. 
While new to some schools, the Alex-
ander students have participated in the 
North Dakota championship competi-
tion for the past 5 years. Each year, 
they have brought home a trophy from 
one of the categories. For this year’s 
competition, these future engineers 
built and programmed a robot they

nicknamed ‘‘Spiderbot,’’ which com-
peted against other robots, doing tasks 
like maneuvering under bridges and 
stacking blocks on a plate. 
This progressive small town of less 
than 500 residents is preparing its stu-
dents for 21st century careers by offer-
ing robotics as a career and technical 
education course for credit at the 
school. The success of this program is 
due in large part to the support and en-
couragement from many, including 
school administrators, teachers, volun-
teers, and parents. 
To the students on the Alexander Ro-
botics 
Team, 
their 
adviser 
Cathy 
White, and all who support them, I 
send my congratualations on becoming 
State champions. They are an inspira-
tion to so many with their knowledge 
and passion. North Dakota will be 
watching as they compete in the world 
championships in Detroit in late April. 
I have a feeling we will be hearing 
much more from all of them in future 
careers as successful engineers and en-
trepreneurs.∑

RECOGNIZING THE GATHERING 
PLACE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to 
honor The Gathering Place located in 
Bonners Ferry as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for March 2020. 
In 2006, Norv and Sharon Skrivseth 
founded Sharon’s Country Store as a 
side business in the basement of their 
home. The store was an immediate suc-
cess, and it soon burgeoned into a 
thriving storefront providing local jobs 
and opportunities to the Bonners Ferry 
community. 
Eventually, 
Sharon’s 
Country Store expanded to include the 
Bread Basket Bakery in 2014 and the 3– 
Mile Produce Stand in 2016. As the 
business grew, friends and customers 
started referring to the stores as ‘‘The 
Gathering Place,’’ and the Skrivseths 
happily embraced the new title. 
Today, The Gathering Place con-
tinues to be run Norv, Sharon, and 
their six children. With the motto 
‘‘Come, Sit, and Stay Awhile,’’ the 
businesses continues to attract locals 
and travelers alike with its wide array 
of homemade products, fresh food, and 
produce. The Skrivseths’ warm hospi-
tality and a commitment to service 
translates not only into a superior ex-
perience for their customers, but also 
into strong community engagement. 
Norv and Sharon are considered pillars 
in the Bonners Ferry community, often 
donating to various charitable causes 
and school events throughout the area. 
Success stories like that of The Gath-
ering Place demonstrate why Idaho is 
consistently ranked one of the best 
places in the country to do business. 
Congratulations to Norv, Sharon, and 
all of the employees of The Gathering 
Place on being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for March 
2020. You make our great State proud, 
and I look forward to your continued 
growth and success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–186. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio 
urging the United States Congress to encour-
age the Administrator of the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to 
change the crash indicator Behavior Anal-
ysis and Safety Improvement Categories 
(BASIC) regulation standards to consider 
only crashes in which the driver was at fault 
for the crash; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NUMBER 8 
Whereas, The Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) uses the Safety 
Measurement System (SMS) to assess com-
mercial motor vehicle carriers in seven Be-
havior Analysis and Safety Improvement 
Categories (BASICs); and 
Whereas, The BASICs include Unsafe Driv-
ing, Crash Indicator, Hours-of-Service Com-
pliance, Vehicle Maintenance, Controlled 
Substances and Alcohol, Hazardous Mate-
rials Compliance, and Driver Fitness; and 
Whereas, SMS data allows the FMCSA to 
assess carrier noncompliance with the regu-
lations promulgated by the FMCSA and pro-
vides the commercial motor vehicle carrier 
industry and other safety stakeholders with 
comprehensive, informative, and regularly 
updated safety performance data; and 
Whereas, SMS data is used to make safety- 
based business decisions using all available 
sources of information; and 
Whereas, The Crash Indicator BASIC in-
cludes data concerning all state-reported 
crashes, regardless of the carrier’s or driver’s 
role in the crash; and 
Whereas, By including crashes in which a 
carrier or driver was not at fault, the current 
data creates an inaccurate, incriminating, 
and imbalanced portrayal of the carrier’s or 
driver’s crash record, with the potential for 
devastating 
personal 
and 
business 
con-
sequences for otherwise upstanding and safe 
carriers and drivers: Now therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
133rd General Assembly of the State of Ohio, 
urge the Congress of the United States to en-
courage the Administrator of the FMCSA to 
change the Crash Indicator BASIC regula-
tion standards to consider only crashes in 
which the driver was at fault for the crash; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives transmit duly authenticated 
copies of this resolution to the President Pro 
Tempore and Secretary of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States, the members of 
the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the 
news media of Ohio.

SONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 
FORM OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. JOHNSON, and Mrs. SHA-
HEEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 524 
Whereas the right to liberty and security 
of a person and the protection from arbitrary 
imprisonment 
are 
among 
the 
principal 
human rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical Rights, Article 23 of the Concluding Doc-
ument of the Vienna Meeting of the Con-
ference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
rope, and Article 5 of the European Conven-
tion on Human Rights; 
Whereas the Russian Federation, as a 
member of the United Nations, the Organiza-
tion for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE), and the Council of Europe, is bound 
by international commitments with regard 
to human rights and the rule of law; 
Whereas, on October 3, 2012, the Parliamen-
tary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
adopted Resolution 1900 (2012) that defined 
anyone whose ‘‘detention has been imposed 
in violation of one of the fundamental guar-
antees set out in the European Convention 
on Human Rights and its Protocols’’ or ‘‘is 
the result of proceedings which were clearly 
unfair and this appears to be connected with 
political motives of the authorities’’ as a po-
litical prisoner; 
Whereas, on July 2, 2014, the OSCE Par-
liamentary Assembly adopted the Baku Dec-
laration in which it ‘‘endorses the adoption 
by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Coun-
cil of Europe of a resolution confirming the 
definition 
of 
political 
prisoners’’ 
and 
‘‘strongly urges participating states to co- 
operate with international institutions like 
the OSCE, to help ensure that . . . there will 
be no political prisoners in the OSCE area’’; 
Whereas, based on the criteria of the Par-
liamentary Assembly of the Council of Eu-
rope Resolution 1900 (2012), the Memorial 
Human Rights Center, one of the most re-
spected nongovernmental organizations in 
the Russian Federation, estimates that there 
are currently more than 300 political pris-
oners in the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the list of Russian political pris-
oners designated by the Memorial Human 
Rights Center includes journalists, civil soci-
ety activists, human rights advocates, par-
ticipants of peaceful demonstrations, adher-
ents of prohibited religious groups, members 
of ‘‘undesirable’’ organizations, and Ukrain-
ian citizens from the illegally annexed Cri-
mea; 
Whereas the longest-serving political pris-
oner in the Russian Federation, Alexey 
Pichugin, has been incarcerated since June 
19, 2003, in violation of 2 rulings by the Euro-
pean Court of Human Rights and the opinion 
by the United Nations Working Group on Ar-
bitrary Detention; 
Whereas opposition activist Konstantin 
Kotov was sentenced to 4 years’ imprison-

Whereas Anastasia Shevchenko, an activ-
ist in the Open Russia movement, has been

2019, on the charge of belonging to an ‘‘unde-

oner of conscience; 
Whereas Yuri Dmitriev, a historian and 
the leader of the Memorial Human Rights 
Center’s branch in the Republic of Karelia 
who has worked to document mass burial 
sites from Stalin-era executions, is being 
held in pretrial detention on charges of child 
pornography that Human Rights Watch has 
described as ‘‘bogus’’ and part of an ongoing 
‘‘smear campaign’’; 
Whereas Dennis Christensen, a Jehovah’s 
Witness and a citizen of Denmark, was sen-
tenced to 6 years’ imprisonment on February 
6, 2019, in a decision condemned by the 
United States Commission on International 
Religious Freedom as part of the broader 
pattern of the Government of the Russian 
Federation ‘‘engaging in or tolerating severe 
violations of religious freedom’’; 
Whereas, on February 10, 2020, a court in

marked by incommunicado detention, tor-
ture, and other ill treatment to extract con-
fessions, in what Human Rights Watch has 
described as an example of the Russian au-
thorities ‘‘abusing counterterrorism laws to 
silence critics and deny fundamental human 
rights’’; 
Whereas, on June 18, 2018, the Department 
of State affirmed that ‘‘the United States is 
deeply concerned by the growing number of 
individuals . . . identified by credible human 
rights organizations as political and reli-
gious prisoners held by the Government of 
the Russian Federation’’ and called on the 
Government of the Russian Federation ‘‘to 
release all those identified as political or re-
ligious prisoners immediately and cease its 
use of the legal system to suppress dissent 
and peaceful religious practice’’; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2020, 43 parliamen-
tarians from 16 European countries intro-
duced a resolution in the Parliamentary As-
sembly of the Council of Europe calling for 
the appointment of a rapporteur ‘‘to examine 
the growing crisis with politically motivated 
imprisonments in the Russian Federation’’; 
and 
Whereas, 
according 
to 
the 
Memorial 
Human Rights Center, the number of polit-
ical prisoners in the Russian Federation has 
increased more than 6-fold since 2015: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for those unjustly im-
prisoned in the Russian Federation; 
(2) condemns the practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment in the Russian Fed-
eration, which violates the commitments of 
the Russian Federation to international obli-
gations with respect to human rights and the

Federation to immediately release political 
prisoners, 
including 
Alexey 
Pichugin, 
Konstantin Kotov, Anastasia Shevchenko,

(4) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise individual 
cases of political prisoners held by the Rus-
sian Federation and to press for their re-
lease; and 
(5) urges the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of the Treasury to use their au-
thority under the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of 
Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of 
Public Law 112–208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note), the 
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-

Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), and other

the imposition of sanctions officials of the 
Government of the Russian Federation who 
are responsible for human rights abuses in 
the form of politically motivated imprison-
ment.

ERNMENT OF DANIEL ORTEGA 
Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. 
PERDUE, and Mr. CARDIN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 525 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has concentrated power and brought about 
the progressive deterioration of democratic 
conditions in Nicaragua; 
Whereas recent elections in Nicaragua, in-
cluding the 2016 presidential election, have 
been marred by irregularities and character-
ized by significant restrictions on the par-
ticipation of opposition political parties and 
the absence of credible international and 
local electoral observers; 
Whereas Nicaraguan security forces, para-
military, police, and other actors working 
under the direction of the Ortega regime 
committed gross violations of human rights 
and acts of repression, resulting in more 
than 325 deaths, over 2,000 injuries, and at 
least 800 arbitrary detentions during the 
peaceful protests that took place in 2018, ac-
cording to the Organization of American 
States; 
Whereas a report by the Interdisciplinary 
Group of Independent Experts, appointed by 
the Organization of American States Inter- 
American Commission on Human Rights, de-
termined that the Ortega regime used delib-
erate, lethal force against protesters and 
committed acts of torture that meet the 
international 
legal 
standard 
of 
crimes 
against humanity; 
Whereas an estimated 82,000 Nicaraguans 
fled the country between April 2018 and Octo-
ber 2019, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees; 
Whereas the Government and people of 
Costa Rica have graciously accepted nearly 
70,000 Nicaraguans, including enrolling chil-
dren in public primary schools, allowing ac-
cess to legal employment, and making ef-
forts to strengthen the capacity of Costa 
Rica’s asylum system; 
Whereas the Ortega government failed to 
comply with its commitment to release all 
political prisoners, releasing just 392 people, 
of which 286 were released to house arrest 
with charges still pending; 
Whereas Nicaragua’s Civic Alliance for 
Justice and Democracy alleges that there re-
main over 150 political prisoners held in Nic-
araguan prisons as of November 29, 2019; 
Whereas a United States citizen and Navy 
veteran, 57-year-old Eddy Montes, was shot 
and killed while in the custody of the Nica-
raguan police at La Modelo Prison on May 
16, 2019; 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has severely restricted freedom of the press 
by closing five local television stations, at-
tacking independent radio stations, arbi-
trarily detaining journalists, and arbitrarily 
restricting print supplies from entering the 
country; 
Whereas, beginning on November 14, 2019, 
Nicaraguan police conducted attacks on 
churches throughout the country, cut water 
to hunger strikers barricaded inside a church 
in Masaya, and arrested 13 people attempting 
to bring them water; 
Whereas doctors, lawyers, academics, and 
other professionals in Nicaragua face perse-
cution and, in some cases torture, based on 
suspicion of aiding or sympathizing with 
protestors; 
Whereas the Ortega regime has violated 
the economic and political rights of indige-
nous communities, Afro-descendent popu-
lations, rural campesinos, land rights defend-
ers, and individuals living in the Caribbean 
Autonomous Regions of Nicaragua; 
Whereas, on November 27, 2018, Executive 
Order 13851 was issued, which blocks the 
property of certain persons involved in the 
Nicaraguan crisis, and its application was 
expanded by the Office of Foreign Asset Con-
trol of the Department of the Treasury on 
September 4, 2019; 
Whereas the bipartisan Nicaragua Human 
Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 (Pub-
lic Law 115–335; commonly referred to as the 
‘‘NICA Act’’) was signed into law on Decem-
ber 20, 2018, imposing restrictions on lending 
to the Nicaraguan government by inter-
national financial institutions and requiring 
the President to sanction non-United States 
persons 
implicated 
in 
egregious 
human 
rights abuses and corruption in Nicaragua; 
Whereas the NICA Act expresses the sup-
port of Congress for a negotiated solution to 
the Nicaraguan crisis and includes an annual 
certification to waive sanctions if the Ortega 
government takes steps to restore demo-
cratic governance and uphold human rights; 
Whereas, in the absence of such steps, the 
Department of State and the Department of 
the Treasury have imposed targeted sanc-
tions on Nicaraguan officials and entities, 
including First Lady and Vice President 
Rosario Murillo, Daniel Ortega’s sons, Rafael 
Ortega Murillo and Laureano Ortega Murillo, 
and 
Nicaragua’s 
Banco 
Corporativo 
(Bancorp); 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Government of 
Canada imposed sanctions on 12 members of 
the Government of Nicaragua engaged in 
gross and systemic human rights violations; 
and 
Whereas, in advance of any future election, 
the Government of Nicaragua urgently needs 
to undertake electoral reforms, including 
the appointment of independent new mag-
istrates to the Supreme Electoral Council, 
the restoration of a 50 percent plus one 
threshold for the presidential election, the 
establishment of a second round of voting if 
the electoral threshold is not reached, the 
establishment of a detailed electoral cal-
endar, and stronger observation by political 
parties: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the Government of Nicaragua 
to immediately release all political prisoners 
without conditions and cease all acts of vio-
lence, repression, and intimidation against 
dissenting voices in Nicaragua; 
(2) urges the Ortega government to respect 
Nicaraguans’ constitutional rights and im-
plement the electoral reforms mentioned

RECOGNIZING 
MS. 
ELIZABETH 
MANN 
AS 
THE 
SANTA 
ROSA 
COUNTY, FLORIDA TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Elizabeth Mann as the Santa Rosa 
County Teacher of the Year. Ms. Mann has 
served the Santa Rosa County School District 
with talent, passion, and an unwavering com-
mitment to serving her students. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best teachers in the Nation. 
Teaching is a difficult profession, yet im-
mensely rewarding. Ms. Mann has performed 
her teaching duties exceptionally, while also 
being an active and supportive member of our 
Northwest Florida community. 
Her passion for teaching stemmed from her 
childhood, as both of her parents served as 
educators. I commend her for her steadfast 
willingness to serve those that matter most— 
the students and youth of our Nation. 
Ms. Mann has set an example for all of her 
students, and has achieved the excellence 
that we strive for in Northwest Florida. 
For all of her contributions to our commu-
nity, I am truly proud to have Ms. Mann as a 
constituent in Florida’s First Congressional 
District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Elizabeth Mann for her many accomplish-
ments, and her deep commitment to excel-
lence, professionalism, innovation, and col-
laboration in the Santa Rosa County School 
District. I thank her for her service, and I wish 
her all the best for her continued success.

HONORING DELEQUA DRAKE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant Ms. Delequa Drake. 
Ms. Delequa Drake was born in Natchez, 
MS on December 12, 1986. She graduated 
with honors from Natchez High School in 
2005. From there, she received an Associate 
of Arts degree from Copiah-Lincoln Commu-
nity College in 2007. After receiving her Asso-
ciate’s degree, she transferred to Mississippi 
State University to pursue a degree in edu-
cation. Upon arrival, she discovered a field (ki-
nesiology) that piqued her interest as well as 
fed her burning desire to learn anything about 
everything. Two years later, she earned a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Education with 
a concentration in Clinical Exercise Physi-
ology. It was after this feat that this young 
adult 
experienced 
one 
of 
life’s 
many 
curveballs. 
While prepping and planning to attend grad-
uate school at the University of Tennessee 
Chattanooga, this 22-year-old, Delequa Drake, 
received a call that would change her life for-
ever. Her favorite person in the world, her 
grandmother, had just been notified that the 
lump in her breast was malignant. Ms. Drake 
decided to put her plans on hold and stay 
home to be closer to her family. She began 
working odd jobs that had no connection to 
her degree to make ends meet. In her down-
time, she also volunteered to coach pee-wee 
basketball in the local recreational league. It 
was then that she first discovered her love for 
working with children. The philosophy for her 
players was ‘‘Grades before Plays’’ which 
worked out fine for everyone except a strug-
gling young reader on the team. Ms. Drake 
took it upon herself to tutor this struggling 
reader while coaching him. 
Much to his surprise and hers, the tutorials 
worked better than expected. The student’s 
grade began to increase mightily. His reading 
grade improved from a letter grade of D to a 
letter grade of B by the end of the semester. 
Still, Ms. Drake had no clue that teaching was 
where she belonged. It wasn’t until a few more 
success stories later that she even considered 
reverting to her original plan of teaching. After 
a lot of urging from family and friends, she 
was now 27 years old and finally decided to 
pursue her passion by taking the necessary 
steps toward becoming a teacher. She en-
rolled in Belhaven University’s Master of Arts 
in Teaching program in the Fall of 2016 and 
never looked back. 
Ms. Drake became the 2019–2020 Teacher 
of The Year from Gilmer McLaurin Elementary 
School. Congratulations to Ms. Delequa Drake 
for her accomplishments. She still lives by the 
philosophy of ‘‘Grades before Plays’’ and tries 
to instill in every child that she crosses paths 
with the importance of learning and her love 
for reading. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Delequa Drake for her 
dedication and tenacity to serving the commu-
nity and the desire to be an example for all. 
PEACE CORPS TRIBUTE 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the important contributions of the 
Peace Corps and its necessity to U.S. national 
security on its 57th Anniversary. 
Over 235,000 volunteers have served in the 
Peace Corps since its creation in 1961. Of 
those volunteers, approximately 7,600 have 
been native Coloradans. All have played a 
critical role in creating community links that re-
main the foundation of U.S. security and diplo-
macy as well as building international personal 
relationships and living out a mission of serv-
ice that extends beyond their tenure with the 
Peace Corps. 
From teaching English, to helping farmers 
increase crop yields, to advising local busi-
ness, the projects these volunteers pursue are 
wide ranging. In these various capacities, they 
function as the face of America overseas in lo-
cations where people have likely never met an 
American previously. Immersed in the local 
community through language and cultural im-
mersion, volunteers are trusted by local deci-
sion makers. 
As an important part of America’s soft 
power arsenal, the Peace Corps has shown 
exceptional mission, vision, and outcomes. Its 
work abroad has resulted in improvements 
along U.S. borders because of its presence in 
Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru, helping to fix 
conditions that have pushed citizens to leave 
their homes. In 2017, 121 retired generals and 
admirals wrote to Congress to convey their 
support for the Peace Corps because of this 
work, calling it vital to preventing conflict and 
reducing the need for military personnel to be 
put in harm’s way. 
Madam Speaker, through the dedication of 
each volunteer, the Peace Corps has become 
an enduring symbol of our nation’s commit-
ment to encouraging partnerships, creating op-
portunity, and expanding development at the 
grass-roots level in the developing world. I 
hope its service inspires other students and 
professionals from all walks of life.

EMMETT TILL ANTILYNCHING ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
one hundred years ago, Missouri Republican 
Congressman Leonidas Deyer introduced an 
anti-lynching bill in the 65th Congress. The 
legislation eventually died in the Senate in 
1918. In the one hundred years since that fail-
ure, there have been over two hundred unsuc-
cessful attempts to prohibit lynching in the

March 2, 2020 
United States through legislative redress. 
Those one hundred years saw the advent of 
the civil rights movement and Jim Crow, but it 
also was marred by undercurrents of racism 
and random acts of violence. 
As the Representative of the Fourth Con-
gressional District of Georgia and a senior 
member of the House Judiciary, this legisla-
tion, which would finally make the act of lynch-
ing a hate crime, has particular significance to 
me and my constituents. Our district is home 
to Stone Mountain which is commonly known 
as the symbolic birthplace of the modem Klu 
Klux Klan. Since 1915, the Klu Klux Klan has 
met at Stone Mountain and as recently as 
2018, white supremacist organizations sought 
to rally atop the mountain with Confederate 
flags. Over the years, many civil rights battles 
have been won in our district, but our fight for 
equality is not over. 
Lynching is a vestige of slavery and Amer-
ica’s views on race and racism in this country. 
It has long been a practice used to keep 
enslaved Africans, and later, free Black men, 
women, and children living in terror. The prac-
tice has irrevocably damaged the American 
psyche. It is time to formally distance our 
country from these heinous acts and raise the 
crime to the consideration of a hate crime. In 
doing so, we declare to ourselves and the rest 
of the world that we will not tolerate bigotry in 
the United States and that those who would 
harm others because of the color of their skin 
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law. 
Rep. BOBBY RUSH’s Emmett Till Antilynching 
Act will finally be considered by the Full 
House. This bill honors Emmett Till, a 14-year- 
old African American boy lynched in Mis-
sissippi in 1955. As we progress towards a 
more perfect union by recognizing lynching for 
what it is—a hate crime, we reflect on how 
this heinous practice has been wielded to op-
press minorities throughout American history. 
My good friend Rep. RUSH brings this legis-
lation to the House floor citing the riots that 
took place in Charlottesville in 2017 and dur-
ing the deadly El Paso shooting in 2019. The 
lynching of black and brown people in our 
country is truly, as he says, prevalent in Amer-
ican society today. Its face may have evolved, 
but the crime of hate that it represents is indis-
putable. 
The Senate passed a resolution in 2005 that 
apologized to victims of lynching crimes; how-
ever, lynching still is not classified as a federal 
hate crime. We honor, today, the herculean ef-
forts from American heroes like my fellow 
Georgia Congressman JOHN
LEWIS, who 
worked to mobilize our country against these 
violent acts. 
We have waited too long to raise this crime 
to the level of a federal hate crime, and we 
cannot delay any longer. Only when we reck-
on with our troubled history and the epidemic 
of hate crimes against black and brown people 
in the United States can we begin to construct 
a more perfect union. 
I’m proud to lend my support and my vote 
to this important legislation. 
INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DES-
IGNATE THE DISTRICT OF CO-
LUMBIA AS AN EMPOWERMENT 
ZONE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a bill that would statutorily add the 
District of Columbia to the national empower-
ment zone program, which provides federal 
tax incentives for businesses to locate and in-
vest in low-income areas. In 1993, Congress 
created the national empowerment zone pro-
gram and left it to federal agencies to des-
ignate a certain number of low-income areas 
as empowerment zones. The District was not 
one of the areas selected. However, in 1997, 
working primarily with Republicans in Con-
gress, I created federal tax incentives for in-
vestment in the District by businesses and in-
dividuals. The business incentives were similar 
to, but more generous than, those available 
under the national empowerment zone pro-
gram. I got the D.C. incentives reauthorized 
regularly until 2011, when Congress refused to 
extend only the D.C. program. At the same 
time, the national empowerment zone program 
continued to be reauthorized and was reau-
thorized last year through 2020. Under my bill, 
certain low-income neighborhoods, particularly 
in Wards 5, 7 and 8, would be treated as em-
powerment zones as long as the national em-
powerment zone program remains in effect. 
The wisdom of the bipartisan, modest, tar-
geted business tax incentives for D.C. has 
been amply and visibly demonstrated in the 
economic resurgence of parts of the nation’s 
capital where they were applied. Among the 
most visible examples are the formerly run-
down area around the Verizon Center (now 
Capital One Arena), which is now surrounded 
by offices, restaurants and vibrant nightlife, 
and the Penn Quarter neighborhood, which 
had limited residential, commercial and retail 
spaces, and is now a popular mixed-use 
neighborhood. 
Unfortunately, the D.C. tax incentives were 
allowed to expire before the poorest D.C. 
neighborhoods were ready to make use of 
them, especially in Wards 5, 7 and 8. With-
drawing the D.C. tax incentives, particularly 
after they had proven to be effective in other 
areas of the city, has left the nation’s capital 
with essentially half of a revival, and was trag-
ically timed just as the lower-income parts of 
the District, which need the incentives most, 
are ready for redevelopment. The effective-
ness of these incentives for the District has 
been demonstrated and their costs have been 
de minimis compared to the measurable bene-
fits they have generated in the District. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING AL WHITE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant Mr. Al White. 
Mr. White was born in Duck Hill, Mississippi 
in July of 1955. Duck Hill is in Montgomery 
County, a county laden with much civil rights 
history. Mr. White has committed his life to 
documenting and preserving this history. 
Mr. White graduated from Duck Hill High 
School in 1973. He is also a graduate of Mis-
sissippi Valley State University. Mr. White 
worked with ‘‘Why Was Mississippi Burning’’ in 
response to the ‘‘Mississippi Burning’’ docu-
mentary. He documented the inception of 
Southern Echo and other entities. He’s worked 
with the NAACP, COFO, ACLU, Kellogg, and 
the Algebra Project. He also continues to be 
instrumental in documenting the conferences, 
events, and interviews around the Veterans of 
the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement. 
Mr. White is currently the Director of the 
MVSU TV Studio and Instructor at Mississippi 
Valley State University. In this role, he shares 
the history of the civil rights movement with 
his students, ensuring that this history is 
passed on to the next generation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Al White for his dedica-
tion and tenacity to serving his community and 
desire to be an example for all.

Knicks to draft him. During his tenure at Web-
ster Thomas High School, he coached the 
boys’ varsity basketball team where he was in-
ducted into the Section V Basketball Hall of 
Fame and the Frontier Field Walk of Fame. 
He completed his career with two Section V 
championships and 468 wins. 
O’Rourke understood that the game of bas-
ketball is mastered not simply through dedica-
tion, but with a commitment to spirit and integ-
rity. We did not just lose a wonderful basket-
ball coach, we lost a devoted man who dedi-
cated his life to his family, friends, and com-
munity. His legacy will live on through his fam-
ily, his players, and the hundreds of lives he 
touched. He is survived by his wife, Marsha 
Barber, five children, two grandchildren, one 
brother, and one niece. 
While I am saddened by Mr. O’Rourke’s 
passing, it brings me great pleasure to have 
represented a man who lived his life inspiring 
all those around him. My heart is with his en-
tire extended family. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body join me to recognize Bill O’Rourke, Jr.

Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of the 100th anniversary of the 
League of Women Voters and the 60th anni-
versary of the Miami-Dade County chapter. 
Founded by Carrie Chapman Catt in 1920,

tecting voting rights and empowering voters to 
advocate for themselves and their commu-
nities. 
The League of Women Voters of Miami- 
Dade County has helped shape our commu-
nity for six decades. This chapter supports a 
variety of issues, from ensuring adequate 
funding for our county library system, to fos-
tering environmental resilience, to expanding 
early voting sites to the campuses of our pub-
lic universities and colleges. 
Miami-Dade County is richer and fuller 
thanks to the efforts of the League of Women 
Voters, and I am grateful for their advocacy

HONORING MRS. FAYE BROWN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a principal at 
the Jefferson County Junior High School, Mrs. 
Faye Brown. 
Mrs. Faye Brown was born and grew up in 
West Palm Beach, Florida. She attended 
school and graduated from Palm Beach Coun-
ty School District. Mrs. Brown continued her

pleted all coursework and is working on the 
final two chapters of her doctoral dissertation. 
Mrs. Brown has served the educational

1998. She is known to have unique distinction 
of serving educationally from multiple perspec-
tives. She was initially hired in the school dis-
trict as a high school English teacher. After

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY

WILTON 
MANORS 
MAYOR 
JUSTIN S. FLIPPEN 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of Wilton Manors Mayor Justin 
Flippen, a dedicated public servant, who loved 
his community and contributed greatly to the 
people of Broward County, Florida. Justin 
passed away on February 25, 2020 at the age 
of 41. 
A graduate of Coconut Creek High School, 
Broward College, and Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity (FAU), he became Florida’s first openly 
gay student body president at FAU, as well as 
serving as an intern for United States Senator 
Bob Graham. He earned his Juris Doctor from 
the University of Florida College of Law. Justin 
was a Wilton Manors City Commissioner be-
fore being elected Mayor in 2018. Active in the 
community, he became a member of the Wil-
ton Manors-based Dolphin Democrats in 1997 
and served as president from 2008 to 2009, 
overseeing the growth of the club to over 400 
members. Justin was also a member of the 
Florida LGBTA Democratic Caucus. 
When marriage equality became legal in 
2015, Justin officiated the Valentine’s Day 
marriages of nearly 40 couples at city hall as 
part of a city-sponsored marriage equality 
mass wedding program entitled, ‘‘We Do It!’’ 
He successfully worked to have Wilton Manors 
become the first city in Broward County to 
raise the Pride Flag outside city hall for Na-
tional LGBT Pride Month, and then less than 
a year later to have Wilton Manors become 
the first city in the nation to permanently raise 
the Pride Flag as the foundation to a monu-
ment and memorial dedicated to the contribu-
tions of the LGBT community and their allies. 
In November of 2018, the people historically 
elected Justin as their Mayor by one of the 
largest margins of victory in a contested race. 
Now as ‘‘The People’s Mayor,’’ but more im-
portantly as a product of our city and commu-
nity, Justin believed in upholding the highest

ing less. He believed that all elected, and gov-
ernment officials should remember and heed 
the words of Thomas Jefferson who said, 
‘‘Governments are the servants, not the mas-
ters, of the people.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Mayor Justin S. Flippen’s 
spirit and loving memory will always live on. 
His contributions to our community will be re-
membered for generations to come. I offer my 
deepest condolences to his family, friends, 
and the entire Broward County community 
during this time of great sadness and loss.

IN MEMORY OF ELLEN M. BLOOM 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the extraordinary life of Ellen M. 
Bloom, a dedicated public servant, beloved 
Congressional staffer and compassionate con-
stituent of mine in Silver Spring whose earthly 
journey concluded on February 4, 2020. I in-
clude in the RECORD her obituary, which was 
published in the Washington Post on February 
7, 2020 and tells the story of her wonderful 
life. 
ELLEN M. BLOOM 
A highly accomplished consumer advocate, 
mother, wife, sister, aunt, friend, mentor and 
devoted D.C. sports fan whose professional 
life was committed to public service, died 
February 4, 2020 surrounded by her loving 
family at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Balti-
more. 
Ellen’s four-decade career included 18 
years on the senior staff of Senator Howard 
Metzenbaum (D–OH); within the Clinton Ad-
ministration where she helped set national 
telecommunications policy and later served 
as Deputy Chief of Staff for Commerce Sec-
retary William Daley; and led the federal 
policy office of Consumer Reports. She grad-
uated from the University of Maryland-Col-
lege Park, and earned her Masters in Public 
Administration from George Washington 
University. 
But Ellen’s most cherished position was as 
the gravitational center of her family. With 
her husband of 33 years, David Bushnell of 
Silver Spring, MD, she raised two children, 
Michael W. Bushnell and Jenna L. Bushnell, 
both of Washington, D.C. 
While the kids were growing up, the family 
set out on extended cross-country road trips. 
As a foursome, they trekked through three 
dozen national parks, visited all 50 states 
and traveled thousands of miles together 
while enjoying all America has to offer. 
Among her surviving family is her brother, 
Alan Bloom of Montclair, NJ, her sister-in- 
law, Miriam Bloom of Teaneck, NJ, eight 
nieces and nephews and two grand-nephews 
who knew her as Aunt Ellen. She was the 
daughter of the late William and Sydelle 
Bloom of Silver Spring. 
Ellen’s untimely death followed a three- 
decade battle against two blood disorders, 
and a recent stem cell transplant at Johns 
Hopkins. The family’s profound sadness is 
eased by the joy and inspiration Ellen shared 
with all who knew and loved her. 
HONORING HELEN CARTHAN 
INGRAM 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Helen Carthan Ingram. 
Helen Carthan Ingram was born March 16, 
1952. She is the second child born to Will 
Carthan, a railroad worker for Illinois Central 
and Doris Carthan, a housewife. 
Helen Carthan Ingram spent all her time in 
Lambert, Mississippi. She was always involved 
in civil rights from an early age of 16. 
May 1968, Ingram was involved in the civil 
rights walk out for the seven civil right workers 
that were incarcerated in Quitman County Jail. 
She and three hundred students marched 
from the Quitman County High School to 
Quitman County Jail. The jail was guarded by 
the United States Army National Guardsmen 
where they were beaten by the United States 
National Guardsmen. But after all of this, it still 
did not deter her from being involved with the 
civil rights movement. 
Ms. Ingram attended Northwest Community 
College from 1970 to 1971. She received an 
associate degree in business administration. 
She later attended Coahoma Community Col-
lege from 1982 to 1984, where she received 
an associate degree in elementary education. 
She attended Mississippi Valley State Univer-
sity where she received a bachelor’s in ele-
mentary education. She received a certificate 
in interim denominational faith from More-
house University. She was an advocate for 
civil rights and worked tirelessly to obtain 
housing for families. She also helped organize 
the first commemoration of the Mule Train in 
1996. She is still actively involved in working 
with the Poor People Campaign, and with the 
Mule Train. 
Ms. Ingram works diligently with Quitman 
County and the City of Lambert, trying to get 
different things for the community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Helen Carthan Ingram 
for her dedication and remarkable works.

CELEBRATING 
ADVENTIST 
HEALTH WHITE MEMORIAL HOS-
PITAL’S 
MALCOLM 
BALDRIGE 
NATIONAL QUALITY AND PER-
FORMANCE EXCELLENCE AWARD 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Adventist Health White Memorial 
Hospital as a recipient of the Malcolm Baldrige 
National Quality Award. The Boyle Heights 
hospital is the first organization in Los Ange-
les, the only hospital in Los Angeles County, 
and the twelfth hospital in the nation to receive 
this prestigious award. 
The Baldrige Award is the highest level of 
national recognition for performance excel-
lence an organization in the United States can 
receive. Since 1987, the award has been 
given to organizations and businesses in that 
have demonstrated visionary leadership, oper-
ational excellence, and drive for providing in-
novative solutions to complex challenges. It is 
the dedication, hard work, and outstanding 
achievements of White Memorial Hospital’s 
associates, physicians, and partners in deliv-
ering quality healthcare that caught the atten-
tion of the Baldrige Award examiners. 
Founded in 1913, the White Memorial Hos-
pital has since become one of the region’s 
leading nonprofit, faith-based hospitals, pro-
viding a full range of inpatient, outpatient, 
emergency and diagnostic services to the 
medically underserved communities in and 
near downtown Los Angeles. As a major 
teaching hospital, White Memorial also plays a 
vital role in training future physicians, nurses, 
and other medical professionals. 
It is fitting White Memorial Hospital’s mis-
sion is ‘‘living God’s love by inspiring health, 
wholeness, and hope’’ because the hospital’s 
volunteers and staff demonstrate daily, their 
commitment and service to improving the 
physical, mental, and spiritual health of the 
community. This award only underscores this 
exemplary level of excellence and dedication 
and I have no doubt, the important role White 
Memorial Hospital will continue to have in the 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Adventist Health White 
Memorial Hospital on receiving the Malcolm 
Baldrige National Quality Award.

COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
BAKU 
AND 
SUMGAIT POGROMS 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to help commemorate 
the Baku and Sumgait Pogroms and to reaf-
firm that the U.S. stands on the side of de-
mocracy and peace—and that means standing 
with the Armenian people. 
Thirty years ago, as the lines of the Soviet 
Union were fading, the people of Artsakh were 
united and voted for greater independence 
from Azerbaijan. But this peaceful movement 
for self-determination was followed by pre-
meditated and government-sponsored attacks. 
Over the next two years, the Armenian popu-
lation of Artsakh was repeatedly victim to bru-
tal and racially motivated pogroms. Hundreds 
were murdered, and thousands were dis-
placed; not only in Baku, but in places like 
Sumgait and Kirovabad as well. 
These pogroms were a direct assault on the 
right of self-determination in Artsakh. And it is 
an assault that is continuing today. I know, be-
cause I have recently returned from my first 
ever trip to Armenia and Artsakh. 
Since being elected and getting to know the 
Armenian community myself, I have wanted to 
visit Armenia. And this visit was so much more 
than I could have imagined. I was able to 
meet both the Prime Minister and the Presi-
dent, have incredible dialogues with the new 
parliament of Armenia, and take in the beau-
tiful country. 
But I also knew that while I was there, I had 
to visit Artsakh. Prior to my trip, my office was 
visited by the consulate of Azerbaijan. They

told me not to go, that it was too violent, and 
that there would be consequences. But I knew 
I had to go, and I had to see for myself. 
Not only was it not a war-torn area, as Azer-
baijan would have you believe, but Artsakh 
was beautiful and charming. And I was able to 
see and feel the national pride that was there. 
Azerbaijan may not want to recognize Artsakh, 
but all you have to do is walk around and talk 
to the people there and you will know. The Ar-
menian people are alive and thriving in 
Artsakh. 
But something else I saw while I was there 
was the lingering damage caused by Azer-
baijan’s war on Artsakh. Land mines still make 
so much land unusable, threatening the lives 
of farmers, children, or people just out for a 
walk. And Azerbaijan’s military still threatens 
the peace along the border. That is why, last 
year, I introduced and secured House pas-
sage of a pro-peace amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. This com-
mon-sense amendment urged all parties to 
agree on the non-deployment of snipers, 
heavy arms, and new weapons; the deploy-
ment of additional OSCE monitors, and; the 
placement of gunfire-locators along the line-of- 
contact. But sadly, despite overwhelming sup-
port in this House, the Senate caved to pres-
sure from Azerbaijan and stripped this amend-
ment. 
And now, in another gift to Azerbaijan, the 
State Department seems ready to end funding 
for demining. This is unacceptable. I was privi-
leged to visit the HALO Trust in Artsakh, 
which leads the demining work there, and I 
was amazed at how much land was cleared 
and made usable again. Thanks to HALO, 
thousands of mines and unexploded ordnance 
have been identified and removed, and Arme-
nians in Artsakh are able to reclaim lands that 
had been too dangerous before. We cannot let 
this work go unfinished. I am committed to 
standing with the people of Artsakh though, 
and that is why, as we consider Fiscal Year 
2021 appropriations, I will be supporting no 
less than $10 million for Artsakh demining and 
rehabilitation services. 
You can count on me to always stand with 
the Armenian people and to stand up for de-
mocracy and peace in Artsakh.

TRIBUTE TO HOWARD SNYDER 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Howard Snyder the founder and 
long-time Executive Director of the Northwest 
Side Community Development Corporation in 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. For nearly 40 years, 
Howard has been a critical ally for economic 
development in some of Milwaukee’s most dis-
advantaged areas and this year will be step-
ping down from his role. 
Howard began his career as a community 
organizer for the Silver Spring Neighborhood 
Center advocating for housing on Milwaukee’s 
Northwest Side. After serving for six years, 
Howard saw the communities dire need for 
economic 
development 
and 
founded 
the 
Northwest Side Community Development Cor-
poration (NWSCDC) in 1983. His vision for 
NWSCDC was an organization that could help 
lead the transformation of the Northwest Side 
of Milwaukee into a preferred destination for 
business and residents. 
Under Howard’s leadership, the NWSCDC 
has served the development needs of Milwau-
kee’s low-income communities by assisting the 
expansion of industries and small businesses. 
Since the year 2000 alone, the NWSCDC has 
lent over $10 million to several major projects 
for its constituency. As a result, economic 
growth has continued to spur, creating new 
jobs, markets, and services for these commu-
nities. One of these notable projects included 
the redevelopment of the Villard Avenue Li-
brary on Villard with 47 housing units for 
‘‘grand families’’, grandparents serving as the 
primary caregivers for their grandchildren. 
Today NWSCDC is one of the oldest and 
most dynamic community development cor-
porations, serving as a model for the rest of 
the country. It has been a catalyst for change 
in our city; rehabbing properties and lending 
funds to new businesses. In a community that 
is 
still 
recovering 
from 
the 
effects 
of 
deindustrialization, this organization has given 
our community hope for a grander future. 
Words cannot express how grateful we are 
to have a leader like Howard in our commu-
nity. His heart has always been set on improv-
ing the lives of the community he serves. The 
compassion 
and 
ongoing 
success 
of 
NWSCDC reflects the kindness and leadership 
he has provided to the Greater Milwaukee 
community. 
While he may be entering a new chapter of 
his life, I know that his work and dedication 
will not end. Madam Speaker, Howard Snyder

his outstanding and impactful tenure as Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) of the Idaho Farm 
Bureau. Rick has dedicated the past 41 years 
of his life to the Farm Bureau and protecting 
the many great farmers of Idaho. Throughout 
his leadership, total membership increased 39 
of the 41 years he held the office of CEO. 
Over the years, Rick has been an active 
and spirited member of the Idaho Farm Bu-
reau. Originally starting as a field manager for 
Southeast Idaho, Rick worked fervently and 
eventually was named Organizational Director. 
Under this title he has worked with members 
and officials from each of the 37 individual 
county Farm Bureaus to ensure ample access 
to county, state, and national insurance bene-
fits for each member. Along with these bene-
fits, the Bureau protects member farmers 
through creating and pushing legislation both 
on the State and National level, working close-
ly with appointed officials for the benefit of our 
farmers. I had the pleasure of working with 
Rick at the State and Federal level. 
Admirably, one of Rick’s favorite jobs was 
working with the many volunteer leaders within 
the organization, who forfeit their free time in 
order to help farmers and ranchers. Even 
though he progressed to a higher office, he 
never forgot his roots. 
Madam Speaker, Rick Keller’s many years 
of service and advancement of farmers across 
our state, as well as his example to the citi-
zens of Idaho will be widely missed. I com-
mend the work he has done over the years. 
May he enjoy his retirement with his wife 
Alene.

HONORING RUTHIE MAE RANSOM 
MORRIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 2, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Mrs. Ruthie Mae Ransom Mor-
ris. 
Ruthie Mae Ransom Morris was born on 
October 24, 1942 in Leland, Mississippi, to 
Henry Parker Ransom, Sr. and Blanche John-
son Ransom. She was the sixth of their ten 
(10) children. 
Ruthie accepted Christ at an early age and 
was baptized under the leadership of her 
uncle, Reverend Clarence Johnson, who was 
the Founder and Senior Pastor of the Shady 
Grove 
South 
Missionary 
Baptist 
Church 
(SGSMBC) in Greenville, Mississippi. During 
her years at SGSMBC, Ruthie sang in the 
Senior Choir, typed and printed the Church 
bulletins, organized special events, and served 
as a trusted confidant and adviser to Rev-
erend Clarence Johnson as well as to his suc-
cessor, Pastor Solomon B. Miller. Following 
Pastor Miller’s departure from SGSMBC, 
Ruthie continued to serve under Pastor Greg-
ory C. Lance, Sr., who, like Pastor Miller, not 
only became the Senior Pastor of SGSMBC, 
but was also ‘‘a spiritual son’’ to Ruthie. 
In 1997, Ruthie joined Agape Storge Chris-
tian Center (ASCC) under the leadership of 
Dr. Thomas Paul Williams, who was a lifelong 
family friend and former member of SGSMBC. 
During her years at ASCC, Ruthie served as 
a Greeter before answering God’s call for her 
to become an ordained minister. In 2011, 
Ruthie obtained her Minister’s License after 
graduating from the ASCC School of Ministry. 
She faithfully served on the Ministry Team 
until her health began to fail in April of 2019. 
Ruthie was educated in the Bolivar County 
Public Schools in Rosedale, Mississippi and in 
the Greenville Public Schools where she grad-
uated from Coleman High School in the Class 
of 1960. She also attended Alcorn A&M Col-
lege in Lorman, Mississippi where she first 
majored in Early Elementary Education. How-
ever, after her first day of practice teaching 
with a classroom full of young children, Ruthie 
quickly realized that she was in the wrong field 
and changed her major to Business Adminis-
tration. She was the first of her siblings to both 
graduate from high school and attend college. 
After leaving Alcorn A&M College, Ruthie 
returned home to Greenville where she 
worked as a Secretary in the Greenville Public 
Schools at T.L. Weston High School and E.E. 
Bass Jr. High School before starting her bank-
ing career as a Teller. Throughout her career 
in banking, she worked at various banks in-
cluding Commercial National Bank, Trustmark 
Bank, and Sunburst Bank, which later became 
Union Planters Bank before eventually becom-
ing present day Regions Bank. 
Ruthie’s natural gift for accurately and 
speedily counting money; her excellent people 
skills; and her strong work ethic led to her me-
teoric rise in every bank where she worked. 
Not only was she chosen to train numerous 
Tellers who came after her, but she eventually 
became the first African-American Branch 
Manager of a bank in Greenville, Mississippi. 
After retiring from Regions Bank, in the 
summer of 1996, Ruthie was hired as the Of-
fice Manager at lnfipro Security for several 
years before her love for both ministry and 
business led her to become the Bookkeeper at 
The Salvation Army in Greenville, Mississippi. 
She ‘‘officially’’ ended her work career when 
she retired from her bookkeeping position at 
The Salvation Army in 2012. However, in 
2016, Ruthie was recruited to become the Of-
fice Manager at Jackson Heating and Air Con-
ditioning where she remained for two (2) years 
and acquired yet another ‘‘spiritual son,’’ 
Malcom Jackson, who was her boss. 
Despite being a working mom with three (3) 
children, Ruthie still found time to be civically 
and politically active in her community. For 
more than thirty (30) years, Ruthie served on 
the Board of Directors of the Brent Daycare 
Center, which later became known as The 
Greenville Daycare and Learning Center 
(TGDALC). While serving on the Board of 
TGDALC, Ruthie worked closely with her fel-
low Board Members as well as various Direc-
tors, including Ruby Gloria Washington, who 
also became a close friend of Ruthie’s; and 
Dollie Creath, who became a mentee of 
Ruthie’s. Throughout her years on the Board 
of TGDALC, Ruthie formed strategic partner-
ships with various agencies to secure the nec-
essary funding in order to ensure that numer-
ous children throughout the South End and all 
over the City of Greenville were able to obtain 
an excellent pre-school education. She re-
mained on the Board of Directors of TGDALC 
until it eventually closed its doors. 
In addition to her civic engagements with 
several organizations including her beloved 
Coleman High School Class of 1960, Ruthie 
was passionate about politics. In fact, she 
canvassed Delta neighborhoods and traveled 
around the State of Mississippi in order to get 
Democratic candidates elected on the local, 
state, and national levels. 
For many years, Ruthie was an active mem-
ber of the Washington County Democratic 
Party, and she worked closely with the Demo-
cratic National Committee (DNC). She not only 
campaigned for State Democratic candidates 
such as Robert Clark, but in 1987, Ruthie 
campaigned diligently to elect Mike Espy to 
the U.S. House of Representatives (MS 2nd 
District). Then, in 1993, she helped to secure 
victory for Bennie Thompson when he suc-
cessfully ran for Mississippi’s same 2nd Con-
gressional seat after Mike Espy became the 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. 
In 1988, while serving as the Precinct Cap-
tain of 3–1, Ruthie galvanized the highest 
voter turnout in the precinct’s history, which 
played a pivotal role in electing Mississippi’s 
60th Governor, Raymond Mabus, Jr. 
In 1993 and 1994, Ruthie was also instru-
mental in helping to elect Greenville attorneys, 
Johnnie E. Walls, Jr. and Willie Bailey to the 
Mississippi State Senate (12th Senatorial Dis-
trict) and the Mississippi State House of Rep-
resentatives (49th District), respectively. 
Because Ruthie was such a gracious host-
ess who maintained a lovely home, she was 
often called upon to host visiting dignitaries at 
her residence, including The Reverend Jesse 
Jackson, Sr., Minister Louis Farrakhan, Judge 
James Earl Graves, Jr., and former Atlanta 
Mayor Andrew Young’s daughter, Andrea 
Young, just to name a few. 
Moreover, long before the ‘‘Me Too Move-
ment,’’ Ruthie recognized the need for women 
to hold political offices. As a result, she served 
as the Campaign Manager or as a volunteer 
for numerous female candidates, including 
Vernita King Johnson, Bernadine Young (De-
ceased), Laverne Moore Holmes, Margaret 
Carey-McCray, and Estelle Pryor, among oth-
ers. 
Ruthie was preceded in death by her par-
ents, Henry and Blanche; her siblings, Martha 
(Bay) Birkhead Brewer, Alma Catherine (Glo-
ria) Ransom, Marguerite (Sister) Clark, Betty 
Jean (Beh Jean) Walker, Henry (Bay Brother/ 
Ramp) Ransom, Jr., Clarence (Scrappy) Ran-
som, and Charles (Bimbo) Ransom. She will 
be missed by many more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Ruthie Mae Ransom 
Morris for her dedication to serving others and 
giving back to her community.

and recognize the remarkable achievements 
of the African-American community. Madam 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing these distinguished students and 
their accomplishments in celebration of Black 
History Month. 
I include in the RECORD
Trenton Blake 
Townes’ winning essay: 
WHAT BLACK HISTORY MONTH MEANS TO ME 
(By Trenton Blake Townes) 
As an African American male, Black His-
tory means a great deal to me. In todays so-
ciety racism impacts the lives of my people 
in a number of ways and for me that is very 
scary. Black history means to me that no 
matter how the world views me, I am some-
body and I stand on the shoulders of those 
before me. I can not think of what black his-
tory means to me without thinking of the 
years of slavery my ancestors had to endure. 
I think of the world we live in, and I don’t 
understand why racism continues to exist 
today. The achievements of black people 
compared to the many pitfalls set before us 
should allow people to see how strong and re-
silient of a people we are, instead they only 
continue their attempts to destroy us and 
what we value and love. 
I wish black history month would mean to 
everyone what is means to me. Black history 
month means to me that in times of turmoil 
I have the strength to rise victorious. Black 
history month is a time where all can re-
flect, not on the narrative they want us to 
believe in, but one that is factual and full of 
strength, hope and promise. It’s one where 
Mansa Musa was King of the Mali empire in 
1312 and is regarded even today as the richest 
man in the history of the world. Black his-
tory month means to me even as an enslaved 
people, Harriet Tubman led about 13 mis-
sions to help many to freedom and shared 
she could have freed more if they only know 
they were enslaved. Black history month 
means to me we must pass the knowledge of 
the achievements of our ancestors like the 
establishment of what was known as Black 
Wall Street. Black wall street was a very 
prosperous and self-sufficient business dis-
trict in Oklahoma where black people owned 
barbershops and stores, schools and even a 
local newspaper. Black history month means 
to me that I can help the advancement of the 
world like Dr. Gladys West who is a mathe-
matician who grew up locally in Sutherland 
VA and helped with the technology used to 
create the GPS systems everyone uses today. 
Black history month means to me it is a 
time where all people should be able to re-
flect upon the history of African Americans. 
This is a time where our culture, contribu-
tions, music, and arts should be celebrated 
as a positive influence and reviewed as leav-
ing a positive impact on the entire world. 
Black history month is a time where we 
should be able to come together as a people 
and uplift one another and celebrate the 
many achievements of our past and the hope 
and realization of a rich future.

REVERSING THE YOUTH TOBACCO 
EPIDEMIC ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 28, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I will vote in 
support of H.R. 2339, the Protecting American 
Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epi-
demic Act of 2020. 
Despite a previous years-long decline in 
youth tobacco use, we have witnessed a 
sharp rise in youth tobacco use and nicotine 
addiction in recent years. At the heart of this 
trend are flavored e-cigarettes, which Big To-
bacco companies have marketed toward 
young people in their ongoing drive to in-
crease their profits at the cost of public health. 
I believe H.R. 2339 takes important steps 
toward tackling the youth tobacco epidemic 
and curtailing Big Tobacco’s unfettered pro-
motion of these highly addictive products, in-
cluding closing loopholes in current law that 
cover traditional tobacco products but not e- 
cigarettes. 
This includes H.R. 2339’s provisions to pro-
hibit the marketing, advertising, and promotion 
of e-cigarette products to individuals under 21 
years of age; ban online sales of e-cigarettes; 
close a tax loophole for e-cigarettes by estab-
lishing tax parity with current tobacco taxes; 
apply graphic health warnings to cigarette 
packages; and provide funding for tobacco 
cessation research, therapies, and counseling, 
as well as for outreach and grants to medically 
underserved communities. 
I also support provisions in H.R. 2339 which 
would waive Medicare’s coinsurance require-
ments for colorectal cancer screening and in-
crease access to asthma medications. While I 
will vote in support of H.R. 2339, I believe im-
portant improvements could have been made 
to strengthen the overall bill. 
For example, in light of the legislation’s ban 
on all tobacco flavors—including menthol—I 
strongly opposed the inclusion of a provision 
that creates a discriminatory exemption for 
premium cigars. This clearly unfair provision 
protects the tobacco habits of wealthier indi-
viduals—who use premium cigars at higher 
rates—while imposing new restrictions on to-
bacco products that low-income individuals 
and communities of color are more likely to 
use. 
I also believe H.R. 2339 should have con-
tained stronger provisions to alleviate criminal 
justice concerns that this legislation could dis-
proportionately impact people of color, in-
crease criminal penalties in state and localities 
across the country, and potentially encourage 
harmful police practices. 
Additionally, while I am pleased H.R. 2339 
takes vital steps to address the youth tobacco 
epidemic, this legislation unfortunately does 
not address the disturbing outbreak of vaping- 
related lung illnesses and deaths that we wit-
nessed in recent months. The CDC found that 
these deaths and illnesses stemmed primarily 
from black market THC-containing e-cigarettes 
with vitamin E acetate—an additive that can 
damage lungs when inhaled. 
Despite these concerns, I believe the clear 
public health benefits of this legislation out-
weigh its faults. There is no time to waste. I 
will not stand idly by while corporate greed 
and Big Tobacco marketing tactics threaten to 
engulf yet another generation to the ravages 
of addiction, cancer, stunted brain develop-
ment, damaged lungs, and more. 
You can be sure I will work with my col-
leagues in the Senate to improve this legisla-
tion in order to put forward well-balanced leg-
islation that can comprehensively address the 
youth tobacco epidemic.
