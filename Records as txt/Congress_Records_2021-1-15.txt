Everlasting God, hear our prayer as

Relieve us from any anxiety that pre-
vents us from believing in and living 
into Your gracious plan for these days. 
Remind us to look not to our own in-

these things in serving Your people. 
This is the day that You have made,

ways reflect both the joy and the hope 
we find, not in our own accomplish-

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-
tion from the House of Representa-
tives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 5, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, The Capitol, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: Growing up in New 
Orleans East playing little league it never 
occurred to me that I would one day rep-
resent Louisiana’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. 
After 
graduating 
from 
Benjamin 
Franklin High School, I left New Orleans 
briefly to attend Morehouse College before 
returning home to attend Tulane University 
Law School. Never leaving those same little 
league fields as a volunteer coach I saw the 
needs of my community and hoped that I 
could make a difference. 
Twenty years ago, I was first elected to 
represent New Orleans and every day since I 
strived to live up to the trust my friends, 
family, and community have placed in me. 
During that time, I have started my own 
family, stood side by side with my constitu-
ents through multiple disasters, and experi-
enced joy and sorrow. Through it all, it has 
been an honor and a privilege to represent 
my home. I am eternally grateful to my con-
stituents for giving me this opportunity. 
New Orleans will always be home, but it is 
time to represent my community in a dif-
ferent way. I am writing to resign my seat in 
the United States House of Representatives 
effective January 15, 2021. I would like to 
thank you and all my colleagues for working 
together to try and improve the lives of our 
constituents and make our country a more 
perfect union. 
Sincerely, 
CEDRIC L. RICHMOND. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 5, 2020. 
Hon. R. KYLE ARDOIN, 
Secretary of State, State of Louisiana, 
Baton Rouge, LA. 
DEAR SECRETARY ARDOIN: Attached is my 
letter to Speaker Pelosi resigning my seat in 
the United States House of Representatives 
and my letter requesting Governor Edwards 
to call a special election to fill the seat as 
soon as possible. Should you have any ques-
tions please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
CEDRIC L. RICHMOND. 
f

REMEMBERING WARNER TIMMONS 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Warner Timmons, another 
beloved husband, father and grandfather lost 
suddenly and senselessly to COVID–19 on 
December 15. 
I would like to use my personal privilege to 
share the words of his son, Jay Timmons, on 
the event of his father’s passing: 
I am proud and blessed to be Warner 
Timmons’ son. I share his name, as does my 
own son. I inherited his sarcastic chuckle 
and his devious laugh, as well as his love of 
practical jokes—and there has never been 
someone as good at them as him. His timing 
was perfect right until the end. He always 
looked out for those less fortunate and was 
always rooting for the underdog—traits that 
he impressed on me to carry with me 
throughout my career. He passed on his love 
of animals, especially rescued dogs and cats, 
of which there were many in our family. Dad 
taught me how to tie a tie perfectly as I en-
tered the working world—a full Windsor 
knot with a dimple in the center, even 
though I was applying to work at a fast-food 
restaurant. 
He taught me to be respectful to every 
other human being I encountered and to al-
ways have confidence in myself. Even though 
he was raised in difficult economic condi-
tions 
during 
the 
Great 
Depression, 
he 
coached me on the importance of table man-
ners, of extending courtesy toward others 
and of maintaining a firm handshake. He 
taught me to work hard and to take pride in 
that work. His own work ethic was strength-
ened during his time in the U.S. Air Force, 
where he was an airman first class—and was 
also first chair trumpet in the Air Force 
Band on his last tour of duty in the former 
French Morocco in the 1950s. He enjoyed 
passing along his love of music to his 
grandkids. 
Maybe the most important thing I learned 
from my Dad is to never back down from a 
fight. So, Dad, I promise you one more time 
that I won’t stop now. I’ll keep fighting, in 
every way I can, to help others and to get 
our country that you loved so much to the 
other side of this nightmare that was so pre-
ventable. And I will hope and pray that 
doing so will protect other families from en-
during the searing pain that we feel right 
now.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. ANDY HARRIS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I regret to in-

13, 2021, due to an unavoidable conflict. Had 
I been present, I would have voted NO on Roll 
Call No. 17.

SPEECH OF 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, opponents 
of this resolution cite the need for unity as a 
basis of their opposition to impeach the Presi-
dent. The key question, though, is what are 
we united around. Is it to support a President 
who summoned, assembled, and lit the flame 
of this attack—in the words of the Republican 
Minority Whip—or is it to unite around free 
and fair elections, a constitutional transfer of 
power, and our core democratic beliefs. Those 
members on the other side of the aisle joining 
us in supporting this resolution are true 
uniters. The way to unite—and ultimately pro-
tect—our country is to hold responsible the 
person who incited this insurrection.

IMPEACHING 
DONALD 
JOHN 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES, 
FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I strongly 
support the impeachment of President Donald 
J. Trump, who has violated his oath of office 
by calling for and causing an insurrection at 
the Capitol. This House would be complicit if 
it did nothing with the available responses. 
One, however, has been taken off the table. 
Vice President Pence has said he will not call 
the Cabinet together to remove the president 
on the grounds of disability. Besides, the use 
of the 25th Amendment would raise its own 
set of questions for most, such as whether 
Trump is disabled. That amendment is usually 
invoked when a President is hospitalized. 
Many would argue that Trump’s actions show 
himself in true form. 
Impeachment is not without its problems, 
especially with only seven days left before 
Trump is out of office. The proposal to delay 
the Senate trial to when President-elect Biden 
hopes to reinvigorate the urgently needed pro-
gram to vaccinate Americans against the 
coronavirus and focus on other priorities is 
also problematic. There is also no precedent 
of an impeachment trial for a former president. 
There are issues surrounding the most dis-
cussed remedies. I say this not because I do 
not support these remedies, but to draw atten-
tion to the need for Congress to go on 
record—to go on record immediately against 
the insurrection of January 6, 2021. The only 
way to do that before Biden takes office is to 
pass my concurrent resolution censuring the 
President for his attempted coup, even after 
votes had been counted and recounted and 
had been certified for Biden, and for inciting 
an insurrection at the Capitol. Moreover, my 
resolution, which, unlike impeachment and 
conviction, would require only a majority vote 
of the House and Senate, and, under the 14th 
Amendment, would prohibit Trump from hold-
ing office again, unless a supermajority of both 
chambers voted to allow him to serve again. 
My resolution, therefore, to censure the Presi-
dent has the possibility of being accepted in 
both Houses since it does not have the high 
vote threshold in the Senate as conviction 
after impeachment does. It also points to the 
President’s admonition to Georgia’s Secretary 
of State, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,779 
votes. 
I believe my resolution can obtain bipartisan 
and bicameral support given the strongly ex-
pressed views of Members of the House and 
Senate about the incitement. My resolution is 
not all that the President deserves. This reso-
lution, however, will put the Congress on 
record against the Trump-inspired insurrection 
before the next President takes office.

HONORING SHARON PAPO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Sharon Esther Papo, a community 
activist in the Santa Cruz County community 
on the central coast of California, for over fif-
teen years of work standing for justice and 
lived equality for the LGBTQ+ community. 
It is my honor to recognize her as she 
leaves her role as Executive Director of the 
Diversity Center of Santa Cruz County to 
spend more time with her family. Her leader-
ship over the past eight years has allowed the 
organization to excel through funding, policy, 
and COVID–19 pandemic challenges. 
Sharon’s activism and professional career 
have followed her educational journey, where 
she earned a B.A. in Feminist Studies from 
the University of California, Santa Cruz and a 
Master’s Degree in Social Welfare from the 
University of California, Berkeley, and soon 
became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. 
Sharon has worked with the LGBTQ+ com-
munity for more than 15 years, beginning with 
her time as Program Coordinator for the 
STRANGE youth program at the Santa Cruz 
Community Counseling Center. 
During her time as Executive Director, Shar-
on has led the Diversity Center to put a more 
specific focus on the needs of the most vul-
nerable segments of our the LGBTQ+ popu-
lation on the Central Coast, including youth, 
seniors, queer people of color, and people 
who identify as transgender or gender neutral.

health organizations to train hundreds of clini-
cians and frontline medical staff in providing 
culturally appropriate services to the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
Sharon’s strong strategic partnerships with 
social service organizations in our community 
have ensured a visible queer presence and 
access to necessary services throughout 
Santa Cruz County. She has led the Diversity 
Center to steady financial footing, tripling its fi-
nancial support from community members, 
governmental agencies, and foundations, al-
lowing for an expanded offering of services for 
the LGBTQ+ community on the Central Coast 
in a permanent setting. 
Sharon’s positive attitude, graciousness, 
and dedication have served her well as she 
represented the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ 
people in her work with community leaders. 
She has been a thoughtful and strong advo-
cate for creating anti-racist awareness and ac-
tion as a primary element of the Diversity Cen-
ter’s mission in its community. Madam Speak-
er, the people of the Central Coast are proud 
of Sharon Papo and her tireless work on be-
half of the LGBTQ+ community. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating her dedica-
tion and wishing her the best wherever the fu-
ture may take her.

RECOGNIZING 
ALTOMONTE’S 
ITALIAN MARKET AND DELI FOR 
THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a staple of my district, 
Altomonte’s 
Italian 
Market 
and 
Deli. 
Altomonte’s was originally founded as Mike’s 
Meat Shop in 1971 by 2 Italian immigrants, 
Mike and Frances Grispino. In honor of their 
Italian hometown, Altomonte, they elected to 
change the name of the establishment to 
Altomonte’s. Through much commitment and 
hard work, this family owned business has 
grown from a small butcher shop to a full- 
scale market and deli with 2 locations in 
Bucks County. 
Altomonte’s prides themselves in having a 
friendly, hard-working, and knowledgeable 
staff. In addition to serving fine Italian cuisine, 
Altomonte’s plays an active role enriching the 
community they live in. As our Nation con-
tinues to deal with the realities of COVID–19, 
they have been a shining example for both 
customer and employee safety. This year, 
2021, Altomonte’s will celebrate its 50th anni-
versary. We are extremely grateful for the im-
pact Altomonte’s has had on our community.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
DR. 
GENEROSO 
‘‘HENI’’ 
GUTIERREZ 
GASCON 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the life of Dr. Generoso 
‘‘Heni’’ Gutierrez Gascon, who led a life com-
mitted to serving others. 
Heni was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1936 
to Filipino parents who had emigrated to work 
on the islands’ sugarcane and pineapple plan-
tations. Raised in rural Kahuku, Heni attended 
the Punahou school in Honolulu and, after 
graduation, moved to New York to attend Co-
lumbia University, followed by medical school 
at Boston University. He had a lifelong pas-
sion for education, believing that his life’s 
course was made possible by the opportunity 
afforded him through academic scholarships 
and teachers who inspired him. 
Heni would serve as a Captain in the U.S. 
Army Medical Corps during the Vietnam War 
before pursuing an illustrious career in aca-
demic medicine that spanned from Boston to 
North Dakota to Saudi Arabia, and, at last, to 
his cherished home on beautiful Cape Cod. 
He was a renowned pediatric neurologist and 
researcher, founding the Learning Disabilities 
Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital and pio-
neering new treatments and pediatric neu-
rology programs. 
Throughout his life, Heni never tired of ex-
ploration, bringing his family to Greece, Egypt, 
Turkey, Kenya and Germany, among other lo-
cations. He was also an active sports enthu-
siast, establishing youth sports programs in 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and was often found 
playing golf and tennis with family and friends. 
Dr. Gascon left us on December 8th, 2020, 
at the age of 84. His commitment to his work 
and to the people around him will long be re-
membered and cherished by his family, 
friends, colleagues, and greater community. 
He is survived by his beloved friend, partner 
and wife Susan, four children, seven grand-
children, and countless others across the na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
life of Dr. Generoso ‘‘Heni’’ Gutierrez Gascon. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in recog-
nizing his life’s commitment to serving and 
caring for others within his community.

IMPEACHING 
DONALD 
JOHN 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES, 
FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 24, a res-
olution of impeachment against the President 
of the United States. Our institution of rep-
resentative democracy is a beacon of hope for 
millions of people around the world and has 
been for nearly 250 years. Last week, the 
President changed all that when he incited do-
mestic terrorists to tear that beacon down. He 
put the lives of every person in our Capitol at 
risk, including those in the presidential line of 
succession, Members of Congress, congres-
sional employees and staff, and the men and 
women of the U.S. Capitol Police. The insur-
rectionists wanted to hang the Vice President, 
kill the Speaker and take Members of Con-
gress hostage. They came frighteningly close 
to achieving their objective. 
Make no mistake, the attack the President 
incited on January 6, 2021, was an illegal 
power grab. It was a criminal attempt to dis-
rupt the certification of the Electoral College 
vote, to overturn the result of our Presidential 
election and to decimate our democracy. The 
President knew what he was doing. He knew 
the lies he spewed on Twitter, at his rally on 
the Ellipse and through his surrogates had the 
potential to inspire violence. He did not care. 
In fact, the President was reportedly delighted 
by the mayhem he unleashed. There has 
never been a more unconscionable act of se-
dition from a public servant, let alone a Presi-
dent of the United States. 
This seditious act must have consequences. 
That’s why, today, I am voting for the Article 
of Impeachment charging the President with 
inciting the January 6 insurrection. He must be 
held accountable. The Senate must swiftly 
convict and remove the President from office. 
He is too dangerous to remain another week.

HONORING UNITED STATES CAP-
ITOL POLICE OFFICER EUGENE 
GOODMAN 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, as we 
move forward and heal from the January 6, 
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, I rise to 
honor U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene 
Goodman. An Iraq combat veteran and former 
member of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort 
Bragg, Officer Goodman was an American 
hero long before he valiantly protected this 
body. 
Officer Goodman risked his life on January 
6, 2021, as he lured a violent mob away from 
an unguarded entrance to the U.S. Senate 
Chamber. His courageous actions that day 
protected our colleagues, their staff, and our 
democracy. Officer Goodman represents the 
very best of law enforcement, and to him our 
nation owes an immeasurable debt. 
As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I extend my 
most heartfelt appreciation to Officer Good-
man on behalf of North Carolina and our en-
tire country. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene 
Goodman.

gaged in seditious speech and conduct that

most vital democratic institutions. I ask my col-

May this body return to our critical work

country, and I vow to safeguard our Republic 
so long as I have the privilege of holding this

I wish to thank the brave Capitol Police offi-
cers and other law enforcement on the scene 
who put themselves in harm’s way to protect 
Members of Congress, congressional staff, 
and members of the Capitol Hill press corps. 
I also want to extend my profound condo-

amid the chaos. We will not be deterred in our 
mission to deliver for the American people.

HONORING JUDGE STEVEN R. 
SANDERS 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Presiding Judge Steven R. Sanders 
for his legal career spanning 37 years as well 
as his nearly 34 years in public service. His 
professional accomplishments and leadership 
in the community of San Benito County have 
greatly improved the lives of those living on 
the central coast of California, and I congratu-
late him on his retirement. 
Judge Sanders is a Salinas native and has 
always felt he had an affinity for advocacy. 
This affinity would motivate Judge Sanders to 
put himself through college, earning a Bach-
elor of Arts degree in communications at the 
University of California, Davis. After gradua-
tion, he attended the University of the Pacific’s 
McGeorge School of Law while working as a 
clerk at a Sacramento law firm. Judge Sand-
ers said that the law was a natural direction 
for him to take. 
Upon returning to the Central Coast, Judge 
Sanders became a member of the San Benito 
County Counsel from 1987 to 2000, including 
six months as County Administrative Officer. 
He later became a Superior Court Judge from 
2001 to 2021, which included 10 years as Pre-
siding Judge. During his 20 years on the 
bench, Judge Sanders integrated a consoli-
dated jury trial schedule to improve efficiency, 
founded a drug calendar for DEJP and Prop 
36, created a library literacy program for the 
children of felony probationers to reduce re-
cidivism, served as the Juvenile Dependency 
Court Judge for 14 years, and was a Pro-
fessor of Law at Monterey College of Law for 
over 10 years where he taught Civil Proce-
dure. Further, he established in-chambers dis-
cussion to manage increasing caseload, de-
signed vertically integrated calendars, and 
formed collaborative courts including Drug 
Court, Behavioral Health Court, and Parental 
Responsibility and Truancy Court. In addition, 
Judge Sanders presided over the approval 
and construction of a new courthouse and the 
Veteran’s Diversion and Mental Health Diver-
sion calendars. 
Judge Sanders recently stated, ‘‘I am proud 
of the fact that the Superior Court has contin-
ued to increase the public’s access to justice, 
while maintaining the highest standards of fair-
ness and impartiality to all. I am honored to 
have served all the people of San Benito 
County.’’ We, on the Central Coast, are grate-
ful for Judge Sanders’ dedication to justice 
and his service to San Benito County. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the 
House join me in honoring and congratulating 
Presiding Judge Steven R. Sanders on his re-
tirement.

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, as an elected 
Member of Congress, I take the same oath as 
the President of the United States: ‘‘I will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and do-
mestic.’’ I believe President Donald Trump vio-
lated that oath of office on and before January 
6, 2021. So, it is with heavy heart that I vote, 
for the second time, to impeach. 
This decision was not done rashly. I have 
listened to my constituents, who overwhelm-
ingly support impeachment, and consulted 
with Republicans, Independents and Demo-
crats. It is my firm resolve that in America no 
person is above the law. We must hold the 
President accountable for his actions. The 
President violated his oath of office when he 
worked to invalidate the votes of American citi-
zens with false and unproven accusations of 
voter fraud over the last three months. He 
took it further by inciting a violent mob to at-
tack the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a well- 
documented public address, he urged his sup-
porters to march on the Capitol and to do ev-
erything they could to stop ‘‘a fraudulent elec-
tion’’ that the Congress was voting to certify, 
as we are required to do under the constitu-
tion. The result was an attack on our Nation’s 
Capitol, our symbol of democracy here in the 
United States and around the world. This 
group of thugs, took over the Senate chamber, 
desecrated the Speaker’s office, paraded the 
Confederate battle flag in the rotunda and 
killed a Capitol Police officer. 
The President has blood on his hands. 
We cannot let his action go unchecked. If 
we do not act, we send the message that our 
oath does not matter, and we will erode the 
very principles this great country was founded 
on. 
It didn’t have to be this way. The President 
could have adhered to the norms that all his 
predecessors followed by acknowledging that 
he lost the election fair and square. A transfer 
of power from a defeated incumbent to a vic-
tor of a different party has happened through-
out our history starting with John Adams con-
ceding to Thomas Jefferson. As his prede-
cessors did, the President could have com-
mitted to a peaceful transfer of power. He 
could have avoided putting our country 
through this traumatic and frightful confronta-
tion by speaking the truth. 
No person is above the law. President Don-
ald Trump lied to the American people and 
then urged a violent group of traitors to over-
throw our legislative branch of government 
and overturn an election. For these reasons I 
sadly voted to impeach the President of the 
United States.

HONORING DIANA BISHOP 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Diana Bishop as she 
retires from a distinguished career in law en-
forcement spanning more than three decades 
and culminating in her role as Chief of the San 
Rafael Police Department. 
Chief Bishop grew up in Los Altos, CA. She 
earned a bachelor’s degree in public adminis-
tration from the University of San Francisco 
followed by an executive master’s degree in 
public administration from Golden Gate Uni-
versity. She went on to graduate from the 
219th Session of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation National Academy. Her career in law 
enforcement began with the Santa Clara Po-
lice Department where she served for 26 
years and rose to the rank of Captain. She 
was selected to serve as Chief of the San 
Rafael Police Department on January 4, 2012. 
Notably, she was the first woman to lead the 
organization since its creation in 1915. 
Chief Bishop developed a reputation for her 
hands-on approach to leadership, accessibility 
to the local community, and penchant for inno-
vation. Under her leadership, the Department 
adopted numerous reforms and initiatives in-
cluding being the first agency in Marin County 
to implement body-worn cameras across its 
entire force. She launched a unique Spanish- 
language citizens academy to increase trans-
parency and foster community relations. Chief 
Bishop also strengthened the Department’s 
focus on social services by hiring a Mental 
Health Outreach Provider to support those suf-
fering from behavioral issues, substance 
abuse, or experiencing homelessness, among 
others. 
Diversity and racial equality were key prior-
ities for Chief Bishop. She joined the commu-
nity in voicing strong support for efforts to 
combat racial injustice, and her mentorship in-
creased diversity among the Department’s 
ranks. Chief Bishop’s emphasis on de-esca-
lation and implicit bias training helped ensure 
the Department delivered a higher standard of 
service. 
Through good times and difficult moments, 
Chief Bishop never wavered from her core 
mission of serving San Rafael residents, and 
the City is better because of her dedication to 
its people and places. Madam Speaker, I re-
spectfully ask that you join me in honoring 
Chief Bishop for her many years of selfless 
service to San Rafael and extending to her 
best wishes on her next endeavors.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR DANIELLA 
LEVINE CAVA 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and commend Mayor 
Daniella Levine Cava on the occasion of her 
historic election as the first female Mayor of 
Miami-Dade County, Florida. 
Daniella Levine Cava was sworn in as 
Mayor of Miami-Dade County on Tuesday, No-
vember 17, 2020, making history as the first 
woman to do so. Prior to her historic election, 
she served as the Miami-Dade County Com-
missioner representing District 8, first elected 
in 2014, and reelected in 2018. Her district in-
cluded Palmetto Bay, Cutler Bay, Homestead, 
and unincorporated areas of South Miami- 
Dade including Redland, Falls, Princeton, 
Naranja, Leisure City and parts of West Ken-
dall. 
While a member of the Miami-Dade County 
Commission, she served on the following 
Committees: Transportation and Finance; In-
frastructure and Capital Improvements; Public 
Safety and Rehabilitation; and the Community 
Disparities Subcommittee of the Chair’s Policy 
Council. She also served on the Transpor-
tation Planning Organization and the Execu-
tive Board of the South Florida Regional Plan-
ning Council. 
Additionally as a Commissioner, her efforts 
focused on delivering on a variety of issues 
like: Fighting for a fair share of resources for 
South Miami-Dade, increasing the County po-
lice force by 80 officers, expanding economic 
opportunity, championing parks and the envi-
ronment, advocating for transit improvements 
and better planning, and hosting the annual 
South Dade Solutions Summit. She secured 
over $30 million in funds for infrastructure 
projects in South Miami-Dade. 
Mayor Levine Cava came to elected office 
after having served as an advocate for South 
Florida families for over 30 years. She served 
special needs children and immigrants at 
Legal Services of Greater Miami, and then 
represented children in the child welfare sys-
tem as Associate and Legal Director for the 
Guardian Ad Litem Program. 
Madam Speaker, in the aftermath of dev-
astating Hurricane Andrew, she was recruited 
to create a new intake system for child abuse 
cases with the Florida Department of Children 
and Families. Her efforts were concentrated 
on the neighborhoods of Miami-Dade County’s 
District 8, where she helped restore the lives 
and homes of those devastated by the storm. 
In 1996, Mayor Levine Cava founded the 
social service organization Catalyst Miami, to 
help low- and middle-income families through 
education and advocacy. Catalyst helps ap-
proximately 5,000 people each year to be-
come more self-sufficient. 
The passionate work that Mayor Levine 
Cava has done in the community also includes 
service with notable organizations like the 
Florida Bar Committee on Legal Needs of 
Children; the boards of League of Women 
Voters, Orange Bowl Foundation, North Dade 
Medical Foundation, South Florida Health In-
formation 
Initiative, 
and 
several 
national 
boards. 
She has been recognized and awarded for 
her impact on the community by numerous or-
ganizations including: the Commission on Eth-
ics, Red Cross, American Society for Public 
Administration, ACLU, National Council of 
Jewish Women and AAUW, among others. 
Born in New York and raised partly in Latin 
America, Mayor Daniella received her bach-
elor’s degree in psychology with honors from 
Yale University and graduate degrees in law 
and social work from Columbia University. 
She came to South Florida in 1980 to join 
her husband, Dr. Robert Cava, a Miami native, 
who returned home to join his father in med-
ical practice. Mayor Levine Cava and her hus-
band raised two children, Eliza and Edward 
Cava. 
Madam Speaker, I urge you, my colleagues 
in Congress, and all Americans to join me in 
honoring Mayor Daniella Levine Cava for her 
historic election as the first female Mayor of 
Miami-Dade County, Florida and her dedica-
tion and commitment to her community and 
our great Nation.

IMPEACHING 
DONALD 
JOHN 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES, 
FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of impeaching the President of the 
United States of America, Donald, J. Trump 
for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
One week ago, in this Capitol Building, 
there was an armed insurrection orchestrated 
and incited by the President of the United 
States himself. 
Think about that for a moment—led and en-
couraged by the President of the United 
States. This threat to our democracy can 
never be overstated; the trauma experienced, 
and loss of life, can never be erased from our 
collective memory or minimized in our history 
books. 
Look at this room, look at this building, the 
scars of bullet holes and mob attack remain. 
We are working within a crime scene. Many of 
my friends and colleagues, on both sides of 
the aisle, were only moments away from being 
overrun by this mob—that was armed with 
guns, handcuffs, chemical weapons, and other 
objects of death and destruction. 
The mob violently smashed its way into the 
Capitol. They sought the Speaker of the 
House to cause her harm. They sought the 
Vice President of the United States to cause 
him harm. Their goal was to overturn the most 
important element of our electoral democ-
racy—a free and fair election. 
Madam Speaker, President Trump has de-
clared war on democracy. He lied to our coun-
try for weeks regarding the results of our Pres-
idential election. He charged up the white su-
premacist mob that attacked this Congress. 
He did nothing as police were attacked, and 
killed, and hundreds of Members and staff hid 
under tables and behind doors to preserve 
their lives. He is a clear and present danger 
to this country and our democracy and he 
must be removed from office. 
Were it not for the bravery of law enforce-
ment, I’m afraid of what may have happened 
one week ago. 
What we do today will be studied by our 
children and grandchildren. Nobody is above 
the law. A President’s primary job requirement 
is to protect and preserve the Constitution of 
the United States, and the lives of the Amer-
ican people. He has demonstrably failed at 
both. 
I implore my colleagues to consider this. If 
we are not going to use the tool of impeach-
ment provided by the U.S. constitution to hold 
those accountable for violent sedition against 
the United States, then what should it be used 
for? 
When our time comes to vote in only a mat-
ter of moments, I call on all members in this 
chamber to honor their oaths, an oath we 
signed only 10 days ago: ‘‘I do solemnly 
swear that I will support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear 
true faith and allegiance to the same; that I 
take this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I 
will well and faithfully discharge the duties of 
the office on which I’m about to enter. So help 
me God.’’ 
History demands that we hold Donald 
Trump accountable for dangerously failing to 
abide by this sacred oath.

OF 
THE

FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
last week, we experienced a tragic day in 
American history when President Donald 
Trump incited insurrection with irresponsible 
aggressive rhetoric that encouraged and in-
cited a mob of his supporters to violently 
breach and defile the United States Capitol 
Building. This attack was a supreme act of do-
mestic terrorism that ultimately led to blood-
shed and death in the sacred temple of our 
democracy. 
I take no joy in voting to impeach President 
Trump, but the president has blood on his 
hands in the wake of this attempted coup. The 
fact remains no one, including the president of 
the United States, is above the law. And this 
president has sadly violated his oath to sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and do-
mestic. As members of Congress who have 
taken that same pledge, it is our duty to take 
this action. 
His constant bombardment of false informa-
tion alleging widespread voter fraud and his 
repeated attempts to delegitimize the 2020 
presidential election has deeply divided an al-
ready fractured nation and has violently turned 
American against American. As this unprece-
dented attack on American democracy and 
our Constitution transpired, President Trump 
was reported to gleefully watch on television 
the attempted destruction to our nation’s cap-
itol while ignoring repeated pleas for him to 
call on his supporters to stand down. 
Trump continues to reject any responsibility 
for the violence and has shown no remorse or

concern for those who have died because of 
his insurrection. A heartbreaking example was 
his initial failure to honor the fallen Capitol Po-
lice officers by lowering the White House flag 
to half-staff. 
At a time when thousands of Americans are 
dying of an insidious virus, which demands ef-
fective presidential leadership and unity of pur-
pose to defeat, the president continues to be 
focused solely on himself. Defeating this pan-
demic cannot be undertaken while we have a 
president who denies its existence and is ac-
tively encouraging violence to overturn a well- 
documented free and fair election. 
Even after the tragedy of January 6th, 
Trump continues to fuel the fire of his sup-
porters with his self-serving and dangerous 
rhetoric and to incite violence and distrust 
across America. He still refuses to denounce 
the insurrection and unequivocally call on his 
supporters to stand down from carrying out 
their armed threats against our nation’s capitol 
and state capitols across the country. 
This lack of leadership and concern for the 
lives of our countrymen and women is one 
more example that confirms Donald Trump is 
unfit for office and poses a true danger to 
America and American democracy. To protect 
our country and our democracy, he must be 
impeached and barred from holding federal of-
fice again.

I cast my vote today for the safety of my

and for the survival of our democracy in the

conscience, I simply have no other choice.

HONORING PETE LOPEZ 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker 
I rise today in recognition of the service of 
Pete Lopez, who is ending his term as Re-
gional Administrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency for Region 2. 
Region 2 includes New York, New Jersey, 
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 
having someone with Puerto Rico roots in 
charge of this Region was especially important 
in these last 4 years. 
Puerto Rico was already facing important 
challenges in the areas of solid waste man-
agement, brownfields, power plant emissions 
and Superfund sites, in a territory with very 
limited extension of lands and waters. Pete 
Lopez made a great effort to work together 
with the Island government, the municipalities, 
and my office, to move through bureaucratic 
hurdles, review prior decisions, and inform the 
stakeholders, in order to perform the nec-
essary work to protect the environment and 
empower the economic recovery of our com-
munities. 
But it was the devastation created by Hurri-
canes Irma and Maria that resulted in the big-
gest challenge with damage to environmental 
control facilities, drinking and wastewater proc-
essing infrastructure, and the generation of 
prodigious amounts of debris that our over-
stretched solid waste management systems 
were in no position to handle. Puerto Rico 
found in Pete Lopez a tireless supporter com-
mitted to our recovery and to have our rebuild-
ing proceed the right way. Prior to joining EPA 
Mr. Lopez served as a Member of the New 
York State Assembly for over 10 years and 6 
terms. During this time, Mr. Lopez successfully 
addressed flood recovery issues; helped cre-
ate jobs; and both supported and advocated 
for children, families, teachers, schools, busi-
nesses, family farms and more. This definitely 
prepared him for what he had to face during 
his tenure at EPA. He knows what constitu-
ents need and what are their concerns, and 
what local and state governments need from 
the federal agencies. 
As he completes this stage in his career, I 
congratulate him on his achievements, recog-
nize his great efforts and wish him every pos-
sible success on the road ahead. Thank you, 
gracias, Pete, for your collaboration and for 
being there for us.

IN RECOGNITION OF JESSE JAMES 
JACKSON 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the extraordinary life of Jesse 
James Jackson, a Congressional Gold Medal 
recipient, a United States Marine veteran, and 
successful entrepreneur. 
Jesse was born in Savannah, Georgia in 
1921. As soon as he was able, Jesse enlisted 
with the United States Marine Corps at the 
age of 21. Jesse served prior to World War II 
training Black volunteers at Montford Point, 
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. After the out-
break of war, Jackson earned the rank of ser-
geant fighting valiantly in the Pacific Theater 
and was honorably discharged from service in 
1946. 
His service, and that of his fellow Marines at 
Montford Point, was recognized with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal. I was proud to present 
the nation’s highest civilian honor for distin-
guished achievement to Jesse personally. 
During World War Two, African American Ma-
rines served with courage and distinction, and 
they were instrumental in the integration of the 
United States armed forces. Their service ex-
tended to the greater civil rights movement, 
with many becoming mayors, lawyers, edu-
cators, doctors and in Jesse’s case, success-
ful entrepreneurs. Shortly after serving in the 
Marines, Jesse moved to Boston, Massachu-
setts. There, he ran a myriad of successful 
businesses and entrepreneurial ventures, in-
cluding; Jesse’s Fish and Chips, Jesse’s Taxi 
and Slades Nightclub. 
After a successful career, Jesse retired to 
Plymouth, Massachusetts. However, he by no 
means slowed down. Jesse was quite the 
jetsetter and was constantly on the move, con-
tinuing to live life to the fullest. 
Jesse James Jackson passed away on De-
cember 13th, 2020, at the age of 99. His com-
mitment to breaking racial barriers in order to 
fight for our country will not be forgotten. Jack-
son’s legacy will continue to be honored and 
cherished by our nation and the many people 
he touched throughout his life. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
life of Jesse James Jackson. I ask that my 
colleagues join me in recognizing his life’s 
commitment to our country.

CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, last Wednes-
day, domestic terrorists breached the security 
of our Capitol, desecrated the temple of our 
democratic republic, and disrupted one of our 
most sacred duties: counting the people’s 
votes for president. 
This mob acted on baseless conspiracy 
theories under the direction and encourage-
ment of Donald Trump. 
While they did not stop us from fulfilling our 
constitutional duty, six people died, including 
two Capitol Police Officers. 
Today, we gather to deliver accountability; 
and it starts with the President, whose actions 
and words led directly to the insurrection on 
January 6th. 
Make no mistake, the choice is clear: we ei-
ther stand as guardians of justice and democ-
racy, or as appeasers of fascism, autocracy, 
and white supremacy. 
We have an obligation to defend the sanc-
tity of our Constitution and lead our country to-
ward healing and unity. 
That does not happen by brushing the 
President’s actions under the rug. It requires 
speaking the truth and doing the right thing. 
If my colleagues are supporters and cham-
pions of American democracy and the rule of 
law, they should vote YES on this resolution, 
and show that attacks against our most sacred 
institutions will not stand.

about the President’s failed attempt to over-
turn a free and fair election, a violent insurrec-
tion, and the ongoing threat this President 
poses to our nation.

an effort to subvert the results and a peaceful 
transfer of power. Through an act of despera-
tion, he called and threatened a government 
official demanding that he finds ‘‘lost votes’’ in 
Georgia or face criminal charges. As if this 
were not enough, the President went a step 
further, pressuring Vice President MICHAEL 
PENCE to unlawfully reject certification of Elec-
toral College votes. Then, in a last-ditch effort 
to regain power, on the morning of January 6, 
2021, President Trump urged his supporters to 
prevent Congress from certifying the election 
results. 
The scenes from January 6th’s deadly do-
mestic terror attack will forever be etched in 
the hearts and minds of our families, neigh-
bors, and colleagues. Mr. Trump has peddled 
vitriol, violent anger, and extremism for years. 
Since the day he was elected to serve this 
great nation as Commander in Chief, he has 
provided oxygen to the dangerous ideologies 
of white supremacy. That hate grew, festered, 
and eventually culminated into the chaos and 
siege of the U.S. Capitol. Five Americans died 
during this violent attack and more than 50 po-
lice officers were seriously injured. 
President Trump, through his traitorous in-
citement of insurrection, broke his constitu-
tional oath to preserve, protect, and defend 
our country. This offense warrants not only im-
peachment but immediate removal from office 
and permanent disqualification from holding 
any office of honor, trust, or profit in these 
United States. 
While it is unfortunate that our nation has 
come to this place, it is incumbent upon Con-
gress to act. I firmly believe history will judge 
the idle and the complicit. On the 13th day of 
January in the year 2021, I am standing with 
my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to perform my constitutional 
duty to protect American democracy and de-
fend the Constitution against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. 
I will vote to impeach Donald J. Trump.

HONORING 
THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF THE SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH 
OF 
CARONDELET 
FOR 
ESTAB-
LISHING ST. JOSEPH’S HOSPITAL 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the contributions of the Sisters of St. Jo-
seph of Carondelet for establishing St. Jo-
seph’s Hospital in Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
History has shown us that communities are 
only able to flourish and succeed when they 
have health care providers that can help ad-
dress the needs of the people. Nowhere is this 
more evident than the pivotal role the Sisters 
of St. Joseph of Carondelet played in helping 
develop Saint Paul and the entire state of Min-
nesota. 
Located in downtown Saint Paul, St. Jo-
seph’s Hospital was founded by the Sisters of 
St. Joseph of Carondelet as the first hospital 
in Minnesota. As the Sisters of St. Joseph saw 
the tragic effects of a cholera epidemic in 
1853, they identified the urgent need for a 
health clinic and lobbied the community to 
help build what would become St. Joseph’s 
Hospital. The ground-breaking facility on Ex-
change Street was completed in 1854. Since 
then, St. Joseph’s Hospital has served the 
Saint Paul and East Metro community for 
nearly 170 years, providing quality and com-
passionate care for those who need it most. 
This core mission of serving those most in 
need is what caused the Sisters of St. Joseph 
to focus on providing exceptional child and 
maternal health care. Whether at St. Joseph’s 
Hospital, St. Joseph’s Academy in Saint Paul, 
or one of the other institutions founded by 
these Sisters, orphans have always been wel-
comed with open arms. Moreover, St. Jo-
seph’s Hospital has served as a regional hub 
for providing women the care they need when 
delivering their child. On a personal level, St. 
Joseph’s will always have a special place in 
my heart because it is where I delivered both 
of my children. Like countless other women 
before and after me, I was provided the mater-
nal care I needed by the best health profes-
sionals. I will always be grateful for the tre-
mendous staff that cared for me in my time of 
need at St. Joseph’s. 
This past year has largely mirrored the 
events which led to the creation of St. Jo-
seph’s Hospital—but rather than grappling with 
cholera, we face the challenges of COVID–19. 
During our current pandemic, St. Joseph’s 
Hospital has acted as an essential hub of 
health care for my district, delivering urgent 
care to many, including those dealing with 
COVID–19. The doctors, nurses, and support 
staff of St. Joseph’s have been serving on the 
front lines of this national emergency and con-
tinue to do so with tremendous selflessness. 
Whether addressing a cholera epidemic, the 
1918 flu pandemic, or the current COVID–19 
pandemic, St. Joseph’s mission of delivering 
care to those who need it most has not 
strayed from the principles set forth by the 
founding Sisters of St. Joseph. 
As Saint Paul and its surrounding area has 
changed over the years, so has St. Joseph’s 
Hospital, which has now become part of the M 
Health Fairview network. While I was sad-
dened with the closure of the St. Joseph’s 
labor and delivery center in 2017 and the re-
cent closure of its emergency department, I 
understand the rapidly changing realities fac-
ing the health care industry. I am confident 
that while the method of delivering care to 
those who need it may continue to evolve, the 
commitment to service maintained by the Sis-
ters will prevail for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to recognize 
the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet in 
honor of their amazing contributions, and for 
their legacy of improving the health and well- 
being of Minnesotans.

COMMENDING 
THE 
LEADERSHIP 
OF MARK MORGAN AT CUSTOMS 
AND BORDER PROTECTION 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 15, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, today, I want to 
pay tribute to the members of the Customs 
and Border Protection who keep our nation 
safe, and in particular, their leader for the last 
18 months, Commissioner Mark Morgan. 
As a Texan, I have spent countless hours 
with the courageous men and women of the 
Border Patrol who have confronted often in-
surmountable odds on a southwest border for-
saken by Washington politicians and left to be 
operationally controlled by dangerous Mexican 
cartels. 
Mark has been an extraordinary leader of 
CBP—fearlessly standing up against those 
cartels, condemning reckless open border poli-
cies, guarding the American people from the 
various threats posed by China, and relent-
lessly fighting to defend our national security 
and with the patriotism and dedication appro-
priate for a career law enforcement officer. 
America is a safer, stronger, and better 
country because of his service, and I am hon-
ored to call him a friend.
