PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Mighty and all-powerful God, who are 
we that You should love us? For we 
have all sinned and fallen short of the 
glory You shared with us at creation. 
Who are we that You should use us? 
For there is not a righteous person on 
Earth who does good and never fails in 
Your sight. 
Who are we to dare to come into 
Your company? For mountains quake, 
the hills dissolve, and all are over-
whelmed in Your awesome presence. 
And yet, You have shown Your love 
to us while we are yet sinners. Your 
favor rests upon us and You prosper for 
us the work of our hands. You let us 
approach with a true heart in full as-
surance of faith in the mercy You offer 
to each one of us. 
So may we be open to receive Your 
love, willing to be used according to 
Your will, and seek You throughout 
this day, that we can and will do all 
things by the strength You provide. 
Now to You who is able to do im-
measurably more than all we ask or 
imagine, according to Your power that 
is at work within us we offer our pray-
ers in Your most holy name. Amen.

HONORING JOHNATHAN PERKINS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated leader, Coach Johnathan Per-
kins. Coach Perkins has shown what can be 
done through hard work, dedication, and a de-
sire to achieve success. 
Coach Perkins was recently selected as the 
2022 United States Track & Field and Cross- 
Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) 
High School Girls Track & Field Coach of the 
Year for the State of Mississippi. This is his 
2nd time winning the award for the State of 
Mississippi. Coach Perkins has racked up a 
total of 12 Mississippi High School Athletic As-
sociation (MHSAA) Track and Field State 
Championships. Coach Perkins and the Clin-
ton High School Track & Field program have 
produced some of the state’s most unforget-
table track athletes. He has created what 
some call a dynasty in the world of track and 
field, and his work never goes unnoticed. 
Aside from his coaching accolades, he has 
been a teacher in the State of Mississippi for 
18 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Coach Johnathan Perkins 
for his passion and dedication in the field of 
coaching.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
DANIEL D. DOLAN, SR. 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the legacy of Mr. Daniel D. Dolan, 
Sr. Mr. Dolan was a U.S. Navy veteran, serv-
ing his country during the Korean War, who 
went on to serve both in the Aurora, IL Fire 
Department and the U.S. Postal Service be-
fore starting his own business, Dolan & Mur-
phy Real Estate in 1965. Dan loved selling 
and buying real estate throughout his career, 
especially land. His legacy development being 
Farnsworth International, which encompassed 
450 acres of land on the North side of the I– 
88 and Farnsworth Avenue Cloverleaf Inter-
change in Aurora and is home to millions of 
square feet of Commercial and Industrial 
buildings (including Chicago Premium Outlet 
Mall) and is the largest Real Estate Tax base 
in Kane County, Ill. Dan was also very proud 
and instrumental in the extension of Indian 
Trail Road from Farnsworth Ave to the far 
eastern boundary of Aurora. Dolan and Mur-
phy had just celebrated their 55th year in busi-
ness when Dan passed on February 20, 2020. 
Born and raised in Aurora, IL, Mr. Dolan be-
lieved strongly in giving back to his commu-
nity. He often did so through his business and 
life’s passion, Dolan & Murphy Real Estate. 
Dolan & Murphy has sponsored little league 
baseball for over 50 years and fastpitch soft-
ball for over 35 years and Dan was inducted 
into the International Softball Congress Hall of 
Fame in August of 2016 for his long-time con-
tribution as a sponsor. Dan believed that 
‘‘what’s good for Dolan & Murphy is good for 
Aurora’’ and worked hard to be charitable to 
the hometown he loved so deeply. 
Dan also spent much of his personal time 
giving back. He was instrumental in the fund-
ing and construction of Aurora Central Catho-
lic High School’s current campus, which 
opened in the fall of 1995. As a graduate of 
East Aurora High School, he was committed 
to being a ‘‘lifelong Tomcat,’’ coaching and 
mentoring many Aurora students throughout 
his life. Dan was honored by his Alma Mater 
in 2011 by receiving the coveted East Aurora 
High school ‘‘Distinguished Alumni Award’’. 
I am proud to represent Aurora, and I am 
grateful for the support and kindness Dan and 
his family have shown over the years. Daniel 
D. Dolan, Sr. was an Aurora icon, is an Aurora 
legend, and his generosity and contribution to 
the city will never be forgotten. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Dolan’s 
incredible life.

CELEBRATING THE 90TH 
BIRTHDAY OF RICHARD E. LEWIS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Richard E. Lewis’s ninetieth birth-
day. 
Born in Sedalia, Missouri in 1932, Mr. Lewis 
has lived a full and vibrant life for the last 
ninety years. His father, J.D. Perry Lewis, built 
the first automobile west of the Mississippi 
River in 1883. With the automotive business in 
Dick’s blood, he graduated from General Mo-
tors Institute in Flint, Michigan and later 
moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where he 
worked for the Pontiac Motor Division of Gen-
eral Motors. During this time, Dick and his 
beautiful wife Darla fell in love with the Lake 
Wylie area. He retired in 1987, and the couple 
built a home in River Hills. 
Following his retirement from General Mo-
tors, Dick began serving with Dick Keffer Auto-
motive and helped establish the Keffer Man-
agement Company Foundation. In 1990, Dick 
was named Executive Director of the Greater 
Charlotte Automobile Dealer Association. He 
grew association membership from forty deal-
ers to over 100 until his retirement in 2010. 
Dick also founded the Charlotte International 
Auto Show, which remains one of the largest 
automobiles shows in the Southeast. The Auto 
Show raises money for charities in the Char-
lotte area and has donated over 7 million dol-
lars to local charities since its inception. 
In addition to his automotive business suc-
cess, Dick has a passion for sparking synergy 
between people and groups and is always on 
the hunt for new projects, especially those that 
help his community. He has been an active 
member of the River Hills/Lake Wylie Lions 
Club for over forty years, during which he 
served as President of the Club for numerous 
years and received the Melvin Jones Award 
and other accolades in recognition of his serv-
ice and involvement. Dick was instrumental in 
helping form the River Hills/Lake Wylie Lions 
Club Charitable Foundation, which provides 
ongoing support to local charities. He is also 
involved with the Charlotte Rescue Mission, 
which provides faith-based recovery programs 
to help those struggling with the disease of 
addiction. 
Dick Lewis has lived a remarkable life full of 
success and service. On behalf of the Fifth 
District of South Carolina, it is my sincere 
pleasure to wish Dick a happy 90th birthday. 
May the next 90 be even better.

Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
activist and serial entrepreneur, Ja’lyn R. 
McElroy of Jackson, Mississippi. 
Ja’lyn is a proud product of the Central 
Jackson Georgetown neighborhood. She has

outreach that she’s done from grade school 
until now. 
She is a graduate of the 2016 Class of Wil-
liam B. Murrah High School, where she grad-

Ja’lyn furthered her education to Jackson 
State University (JSU), where she received

JSU, she was known for her engagement with 
the student body by showing her service

Force ROTC, Pre-Alumni Council, Girl’s Coali-
tion, and more. Ja’lyn is now a candidate at 
JSU to receive her Master’s in Business Ad-
ministration. 
After undergrad, Ja’lyn wanted to follow 
back into her footsteps of being a entre-
preneur. In 2020, she opened an online store 
to sell her skincare products; as well as a 
marketing agency to help small business own-
ers function throughout their business. Re-
cently, Ja’lyn founded a nonprofit organization 
to end period poverty and provide unlimited 
period aid. Through her organization, The 
P.U.P.A Project, she’s not only been an activ-
ist but an advocate for all women. Since 
founding the organization last July, she’s pro-
vided over 18,000 worth of period aid to young 
girls and women in the South.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MR. 
HOWARD MISKELLY 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life and accomplishments of Mr. 
Howard Miskelly of Mississippi. As a business-
man, veteran, and local leader, Mr. Miskelly 
left a legacy that will be remembered by his 
family, peers, and community for many gen-
erations to come. 
Drafted into World War II, Mr. Miskelly 
served his country honorably, earned the rank 
of Staff Sergeant, and was awarded two 
Bronze Stars. I am humbled by Mr. Miskelly’s 
heroic actions to protect and serve our great 
nation, and our country is grateful for his serv-
ice. 
After his military service, Mr. Miskelly strived 
for greatness in his daily life as he attended 
Union University on a basketball scholarship. 
He later transferred to Mississippi State Uni-
versity (MSU) where he was Cadet Colonel of 
the MSU ROTC and president of the Alpha 
Tau Omega Fraternity. 
Following his education, Mr. Miskelly re-
turned to Okolona, opened a furniture store, 
and started a family. Mr. Miskelly was a com-
mitted Christian and remarked that his great-
est accomplishment in life was that his family 
all walked with the Lord. He loved his family, 
and his love for the Lord touched numerous 
lives. Mr. Miskelly also served on the Veterans 
Administration Board, on the board for the 
Mississippi School for the Deaf and Blind, and 
as president of the Mississippi Retail Associa-
tion. 
Mississippi is honored to call Mr. Howard 
Miskelly one of its own. Although his time on 
Earth is over, his legacy that he has left 
through his service, family, community, and 
faith will endure.

RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY 
SERVICE OF JIM OLIVER 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in celebration, honoring a man 
who has dedicated himself to serving his com-
munity of Santa Clarita and beyond in an as-
tounding manner: Jim Oliver. After serving in 
the United States Army, he became a member 
of the service organization Optimist Inter-
national and has remained involved for over 
52 years. His continued involvement reflects 
his genuine belief in the organization’s goals, 
which is evident in his optimism and compas-
sion towards everyone he encounters. As a 
member of Optimist International, Jim Oliver 
prioritizes meeting the needs of young people 
across the world alongside the mission of 
bringing out the best in every individual as 
they develop into their greatest potential. 
Jim has consistently recruited and sought 
new members to sponsor and mentor within 
Optimist while upholding a steady commitment 
to the Optimist Creed. Since 1970, Jim has 
been named an officer at the Optimist Inter-
national and district level 78 times and main-
tained membership in 9 different clubs. Putting 
the Optimist Creed into action, he has dedi-
cated time to the Blind Olympics, taught water 
skiing to the Braille Institute, and provided ne-
cessities to an orphanage in Mazatla´n, Mex-
ico. These philanthropic exploits are just a few 
of the many examples of service that Jim has 
displayed in his over five decades of member-
ship to Optimist International. 
His service has left a remarkable impact on 
not only our local community, but in commu-
nities around the world. Those that have 
served alongside can attest he is undoubtedly 
due recognition by his nation and Optimist 
International. It is an honor to represent him in 
the United States Congress.

HONORING LILLIAN LEWIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a bright and vi-
brant student, Lillian Lewis. Lillian has shown 
what can be done through hard work, dedica-
tion, and a desire to achieve success. 
Lillian Lewis is the Valedictorian of the 
Holmes County Central High School Class of 
2022. She currently has a 4.04 GPA. Lillian is 
the daughter of Mr. Benjamin and Mrs. 
Shanatosha Lewis. Lillian has always been 
supported through every endeavor by her fam-
ily. The love and respect they share for one 
another has taken her a long way. 
Throughout her high school years, Lillian 
has prided herself on being the absolute best 
version of herself. She is driven, dependable, 
and resourceful. These characteristics shaped 
her school life tremendously. She has accom-
plished many academic goals already. She is 
a part of the National Honors Society, Beta 
Club, National Society of High School Schol-
ars, The National Society of Future Physi-
cians, and the Superintendent’s Round Table. 
Lillian has chosen to spend the next chapter 
of her life at the University of Mississippi in 
Oxford MS, majoring in biomedical engineer-
ing on a Pre-Med track to become an internal 
medicine physician. Lillian hopes to take every 
experience life has to offer her and learn from 
them, whether they are good, bad, happy, or 
sad. Lillian lives knowing that without God 
none of this would be possible. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Holmes County Central 
Highschool’s 2022 valedictorian, Lillian Lewis, 
for being an exemplary student and citizen.

HONORING JAMES TIPTON 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a patriotic American, Mr. James Tip-
ton. Mr. Tipton lives in Waco, Kentucky. He 
celebrated his 99th birthday on July 24, 2022. 
Mr. Tipton grew up on his family’s farm in 
Union City, Kentucky. In 1941, a new Ordi-
nance called the Bluegrass Army Depot was 
opening in Richmond and Mr. Tipton helped 
work on it. In December of 1942, he decided 
to enlist and joined the United States Army Air 
Corps. Following basic training, he was as-
signed as a right-wing gunner. He was sent 
overseas and flew missions over Europe. On 
his last mission in April of 1944, his plane ran 
short of fuel, and they lost engine power. The 
crew had to jump out of the camera hatch. 
They landed over enemy territory in France 
and were captured by German soldiers and 
taken as prisoners of war. Mr. Tipton spent 13 
months as a POW in Krems, Austria in STA-
LAG XVII–B. After a march of about 160 
miles, the prisoners were liberated on April 26, 
1945. 
Following his time in the service, Mr. Tipton 
returned to Madison County and worked at the 
Bluegrass Ordinance for many years. He is a 
faithful member of the Waco Baptist Church, 
where he is the oldest male member. Mr. Tip-
ton is well-respected by his community. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. James Tip-
ton, celebrate his 99th birthday and thank him 
for his service and sacrifice to our nation dur-
ing World War II. As a part of ‘‘The Greatest 
Generation,’’ Mr. Tipton and his fellow soldiers 
are true heroes who bravely served and sac-
rificed to preserve the freedoms that we enjoy 
today, and we can never thank them enough. 
I am forever grateful for Americans like James 
Tipton.

BIDEN ‘‘LETTERS’’ ON AFGHANI-
STAN 
WITHDRAWAL: 
NEARLY 
ONE YEAR LATER 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, during his August 26th remarks re-
garding the 2021 terrorist attack at the Kabul, 
Afghanistan 
airport, 
where 
13 
American 
servicemembers were murdered, Biden was 
asked about the Afghanistan withdrawal and 
the addition of forces to protect Americans 
during the evacuation. 
Biden responded that military leaders have 
contacted him, ‘‘. . . usually by letter, saying 
they subscribe to the mission as designed 
. . .’’. 
That evening, I sent the first of now five 
written requests to the White House asking for 
copies of these letters by a deadline of Sep-
tember 11. Nearly one year later, I am still 
waiting for a reply. 
During an August 2021 House Armed Serv-
ices Committee hearing, Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley and General Frank 
McKenzie, then the commander of the U.S. 
Central Command, both testified that they had 
recommended to Biden that he should leave a 
residual troop presence. 
Additionally, in a closed Senate hearing, 
Operation Resolute Support Commander Gen-
eral Scott Miller testified that he opposed the 
Biden administration’s decision to withdraw all 
U.S. forces, citing the threat posed by the 
Taliban.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E855 
August 16, 2022 
The decision to withdraw U.S. forces from 
Afghanistan and abandon Americans regard-
less of the conditions on the ground, has been 
correctly identified by Senate Majority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL as ‘‘one of the worst for-
eign policy decisions in American history.’’ 
While President Donald Trump went a step 
further saying, ‘‘This is the greatest embar-
rassment . . . in the history of our country.’’ 
President Trump has made clear his with-
drawal would have been orderly and Bagram 
Air Base would have been maintained to de-
feat a terrorist safe haven. 
Sadly, no response from the White House 
reveals admission of no ‘letters.’ 
It is also important to ask where the Amer-
ican media is on this critical issue of the 
claimed Afghanistan letters? 
Ultimately, this ill-advised decision not only 
resulted in the death of U.S. servicemembers, 
but put the reputation and credibility of the 
U.S. in question, all while leaving the remain-
ing American citizens in Afghanistan vulner-
able. 
The world is less safe with the Taliban re-
gime emboldened. 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years, 
as the Global War on Terrorism continues 
moving from a safe haven in Afghanistan to 
America.

HONORING BRIANNA MCFIELD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated 
leader, 
Brianna 
McField. 
Brianna has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve 
success. 
Brianna McField is the 2013 Valedictorian of 
Yazoo County High School, an alumna of 
Millsaps College, and a current student at 
Jackson State University seeking her doc-
torate in Public Health Policy and Administra-
tion. She proves that beauty queens are more 
than pretty faces. 
Brianna will go on to represent the state of 
Mississippi in the 2022 Miss Black USA Schol-
arship Pageant. She is a strong advocate for 
education and the uplift of women. Brianna 
has promoted women’s empowerment and 
education about public health and social jus-
tice topics including heart disease, sex traf-
ficking, autism awareness, and financial lit-
eracy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MR. 
KEN SPEARS OF NESHOBA COUN-
TY 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life and legacy of Mr. Ken 
Spears of Neshoba County, Mississippi. In 
Matthew 5:16 Jesus says, ‘‘let your light shine 
before others, that they may see your good 
deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.’’ Ken 
Spears undoubtably was a man who em-
bodied a servant’s heart. 
Mr. Spears dedicated his life to serving his 
community. He began his service as a law en-
forcement officer and continued in that role for 
20 years. He cared for his community as a 
school bus driver for the Neshoba County 
School System. As a founding member of the 
Linwood Fire Department, he also served as a 
firefighter and board president. 
Philippians 2:3–4 says, ‘‘Do nothing out of 
selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in hu-
mility value others above yourselves, not look-
ing to your own interests but each of you to 
the interests of the others.’’ Mr. Spears’s life 
was an example of selflessly serving others 
and living a life of purpose that our Lord has 
called for us. He served his community whole-
heartedly, was adored by many, and lived a 
life with compassion. I am inspired by Ken 
Spears’s goodwill and selflessness, and I am 
grateful for his actions that touched numerous 
lives. The great State of Mississippi is proud 
to call Ken Spears one of its own.

ters, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, 
and specialty surgeons. They also provide 
acute and chronic pain management services 
to patients in need of such care. CRNAs pro-
vide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases 
and are the sole anesthesia providers in many 
rural hospitals.

BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I 
came to Congress with a mission to make the 
federal government a better partner to local 
communities to make them more livable, 
healthy, and economically secure. 
Last week, Congress made unprecedented 
progress on fulfilling the fundamental premise 
of this mission. The House and Senate both 
passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic 
investment in our nation’s health, climate, and 
economy, including several provisions I au-
thored to combat the climate crisis. President 
Biden is expected to sign the legislation into 
law this afternoon. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will save Ameri-
cans $288 billion on health care over the next 
ten years. Critically, it will allow Medicare to 
negotiate prescription drug prices, starting with 
the ten most expensive prescriptions. These 
negotiations will bring down costs for patients 
and taxpayers alike. When combined with new 
provisions capping Medicare beneficiaries’ out- 
of pocket costs at $2,000 a year, the legisla-
tion will make an extraordinary difference in 
peoples’ lives. 
This package is the single largest invest-
ment in climate action in our nation’s history. 
It will deliver $385 billion in energy and climate 
investments, including for electric vehicles, 
solar and wind energy, pollution reduction, and 
support for the vulnerable communities most 
impacted by environmental degradation. Long 
term extensions to the production and invest-
ment tax credits, including direct pay and 
transferability provisions, are critical compo-
nents in ending our dependence on fossil 
fuels. I am also pleased that the investment 
tax credit was expanded to include energy 
storage projects, a key piece of the puzzle in 
delivering renewable energy to households at 
any time of day. 
Combatting the climate crisis also means in-
vesting in infrastructure that is sustainable and 
efficient. Clean transportation incentives like 
an expanded electric vehicle credit for new 
and used vehicles, an expanded credit to 
charge e-bikes and e-scooters, and incentives 
to electrify commercial fleets will help accel-
erate the reduction of carbon emissions and 
fossil fuels in our day-to-day activities. Like-
wise, any construction projects in the 21st 
century must be made to meet the needs and 
goals of our communities. That’s why I advo-
cated for provisions in this package that make 
commercial buildings more energy efficient 
and sustainable. 
While working families in our community 
and across the nation are struggling to pay for 
basic goods like gas, groceries, and rent, 
ultra-wealthy corporations are raking in record 
profits. Inflation is hitting Americans hard while 
many corporations aren’t paying their fair 
share. This legislation will enact a corporate 
minimum tax of 15 percent. Currently, hun-
dreds of the largest corporations in America 
pay substantially less, or nothing, in taxes. 
This provision ensures that large corporations 
will pay a minimum of 15 percent in taxes. 
The legislation also makes polluters pay by in-
cluding my legislation reinstating the Super-
fund tax on crude oil. 
It is no secret that the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) is outmatched. Decades of 
chronic underfunding have left the IRS under-
staffed and overburdened, allowing hundreds 
of billions of dollars in taxes owed to go uncol-
lected. This legislation provides $3.2 billion for 
taxpayer services and $45.6 billion for en-
forcement, which the Congressional Budget 
Office estimates will raise more than $200 bil-
lion in additional revenue for the federal gov-
ernment. By investing in the IRS, we can fi-
nally close the ‘‘tax gap’’ between what people 
owe and what they end up paying. 
The Inflation Reduction Act represents more 
than the sum of these individual provisions, it 
is proof that our system works and that the 
United States has the capacity to solve our 
most pressing challenges in the years ahead.

HONORING GLORIA TRIPLETT- 
JACKSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
educator and recent retiree, Mrs. Gloria Trip-
lett-Jackson. 
Mrs. Jackson began her educational journey 
in the ’70s as a basketball player and grad-
uate from Greenville High School, where she 
became the high school first female to play in 
the Mississippi High School All Star game. 
Mrs. Jackson went on to further her edu-
cation at Alcorn State University, where she 
obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 
Business Administration. She began her ca-
reer teaching and coaching at Jonesboro High 
School in Louisiana, while in graduate school 
at Grambling State University. 
Nine Years later, Mrs. Jackson returned to 
Greenville and finished her second master’s 
degree at Delta State University. Mrs. Jackson 
spent more than 22 years in the Leland 
School District, serving in a number of posi-
tions, such as a teacher, coach, assistant prin-
cipal, principal, curriculum specialist, and 
eventually superintendent until 2015. Under 
Mrs. Jackson’s leadership, Leland School Dis-
trict improved, moving from an ‘‘F’’ failing rat-
ing to a ‘‘C’’ successful rating. 
After a short stint of running her own edu-
cational consulting firm, Mrs. Jackson returned 
to public school as the principal at Riverside 
Elementary in the Western Line School Dis-
trict. Once again, she propelled her school to 
excellence by becoming one of the few 
schools in the Mississippi Delta to receive an 
‘‘A’’ rating, which the school has maintained to 
date. She has also served as the Deputy Su-
perintendent, Chief Academic Officer for West-
ern Line for the past four years. 
Mrs. Jackson has received numerous acco-
lades over the years from Western Line 
School District, Washington County, DAAIS, 
MHSAA, and from the state of Mississippi for 
her accomplishments as a public school lead-
er. 
After a successful career in public edu-
cation, of more than 40 years, Mrs. Jackson 
has decided to embrace retirement and any 
new challenges ahead. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Gloria Triplett-Jackson 
for her passion and dedication to serving and 
educating her community.

CONGRESSIONAL BANGLADESH 
CAUCUS INAUGURATION 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I join 
with my colleagues, Congressmen GERRY 
CONNOLLY, DWIGHT EVANS, and STEVE CHABOT 
as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ban-
gladesh Caucus. 
We look forward to strengthening the United 
States-Bangladesh Relationship on the basis 
of our shared democratic values to address 
major issues, including climate change, human 
rights, and humanitarian challenges. The Peo-
ple of Bangladesh are well represented by the 
Bangladeshi Ambassador M Shahidul Islam. 
The Caucus was established, in part, to 
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of diplo-
matic relations between the United States and 
Bangladesh, which began in 1972, soon after 
Bangladesh secured its independence from 
Pakistan. The United States has been a long-
standing partner in Bangladesh’s journey to 
economic development and democratic institu-
tion building since that time. 
During the last 50 years, Bangladesh has 
made significant socio-economic progress, in-
cluding increased food production, disaster 
management capacity building, poverty allevi-
ation, improved health and education, and 
women’s empowerment. For more than a dec-
ade, Bangladesh has remained one of the 
fastest-growing economies in the world, and 
its economic growth is not only benefiting its 
own people, but is also contributing to the 
peace, progress, and prosperity of the Indo- 
Pacific Region. 
Significantly, no other country in the world 
commits more forces to United Nations Peace-
keeping. 
Bangladesh has a population of over 170 
million, with a per capita income higher than

its neighbors in South Asia. The United States 
is one of Bangladesh’s most important trading 
partners, with approximately 19–20 percent of 
its exports destined for the United States. 
Also, bilateral trade between the United States 
and Bangladesh was over $10 billion (U.S.) in 
2021. 
According to the United States Census Bu-
reau, there are over 200,000 people of 
Bangladeshi Origin living in America. Pro-
moting educational exchanges between Ban-
gladesh and the United States benefits both 
nations, and with approximately 10,000 stu-
dents from Bangladesh studying in the United 
States, the country places eighth in the World 
in this category. 
The Congressional Bangladesh Caucus will 
promote continued good relations between the 
United States and Bangladesh. Caucus Mem-
bers will receive periodic updates on our bilat-
eral relationship, joint efforts to combat ter-
rorism and promote human rights, as well as 
opportunities for high-level visits between the 
two countries, including with Ambassador M 
Shahidul Islam as we work to strengthen our 
relationship.

INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO PRO-
VIDE 
SUPPLEMENTAL 
APPRO-
PRIATIONS 
FOR 
THE 
EMER-
GENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PRO-
GRAM 
TO 
PROVIDE 
HUMANI-
TARIAN RELIEF FOR MIGRANTS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce a fiscal year 2022 supple-
mental appropriations bill to provide $50 mil-
lion to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency’s Emergency Food and Shelter Pro-
gram (EFSP) for humanitarian assistance for 
migrants. The funding would remain available 
until expended. 
Since mid-April, the governors of Texas and 
Arizona have exploited and harmed approxi-
mately 4,500 vulnerable people fleeing des-
perate and dangerous situations in their home 
countries for political gain by busing them to 
the District of Columbia and New York. 
In fiscal year 2022, Congress provided $150 
million to the EFSP for humanitarian assist-
ance for migrants. As of July 21, 2022, ap-
proximately $85 million of this funding re-
mained available. However, the busing of mi-
grants to D.C. and New York has increased 
funding requests and the EFSP may exhaust 
its funding. 
Supplemental funding would ensure that the 
EFSP can continue to provide humanitarian 
assistance to migrants. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.

nity service. In both endeavors, she does not 
seek praise for her actions, but will ensure 
others are praised for their accomplishments. 
Colonel 
Bell-Carter 
has 
proven 
herself 
throughout her career and earned a reputation 
of impeccable character, unquestionable integ-
rity, unparalleled professional achievement, 
and superior leadership. She lives by her

leader.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Colonel Melanie Bell-Carter 
for her leadership, service, and dedication to 
the United States Marine Corps.

HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate Cadence Raine Nickey on 
being recognized as the 2022–2023 Choctaw

MENTAL 
ILLNESS 
(NAMI), SAN DIEGO REGION 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mrs. Maria Eugenia Osuna of the Na-
tional Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), San 
Diego Region. Mrs. Osuna served as the Out-
reach Coordinator for this organization for ten 
years. She is currently retired and is a resi-
dent of the Castle Park community in the City 
of Chula Vista, CA. 
Mrs. Osuna has been recognized for her 
long years of service with NAMI, during which 
she founded and organized various support 
group programs throughout San Diego County 
to help minority parents who have children 
with mental illness. 
Before for her professional career with 
NAMI, Mrs. Osuna served as a volunteer for 
the organization, because her son was diag-
nosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age 
of 17. Both her father and brother were diag-
nosed with mental illnesses, and both com-
mitted suicide. Mrs. Osuna did not want her 
son to suffer the same fate. 
After realizing that resources for minority 
families with mental illness were limited, Mrs. 
Osuna took NAMI’s 12-week program to learn 
more about her son’s illness, and she began 
to assist other minority families with similar sit-
uations. Through her time and commitment, 
Mrs. Osuna was formally offered a position 
with NAMI. 
Mrs. Osuna created and organized support 
groups for Latinx parents who have children 
with a mental illness. Her support group pro-
grams were the first in San Diego County to 
be held in Spanish. Mrs. Osuna’s goal has al-
ways been to provide education, support, and 
advocacy to minority families, as well as to 
dispel misconceptions and stereotypes on 
mental illness. 
Mrs. Osuna is to be honored as the 51st 
District Constituent of the Month, particularly 
during National Minority Mental Health Aware-
ness Month, for her outstanding commitment 
to supporting minority families with education 
and advocacy on mental health awareness, as 
well as all her service and efforts that have 
helped those in need build a brighter future.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. JOHN 
SHIRLEY 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Dr. John Shirley, who dedicated his life to 
serving his country and his community. John 
passed away on December 22, 2021, leaving 
a legacy of service to and love of country and 
community. 
Dr. John Shirley was born in Santa Ana, 
California on December 8, 1924. At 19 years 
old, after being drafted and rising quickly to 
the rank of Staff Sergeant, John was part of 
the Anzio breakout with the 3rd Infantry Divi-
sion. After taking part in the invasion of South-
ern France, he was wounded by fragments of 
a shell from a German tank and taken pris-
oner. As he and other prisoners were being 
marched to the rear, a young German soldier 
bringing up the rear of the column got too 
close, and John turned around and slugged 
him, rendering him unconscious and allowing 
John to escape to Allied lines. John was 
awarded a battlefield commission to Second 
Lieutenant when he rejoined his unit after 
three months in the hospital recovering from 
his wounds. 
Aside from his commission, John was 
awarded a Purple Heart, Silver Star, and two 
Bronze Stars with Oak Leaf Cluster and V for 
Valor devise. He earned the European The-
ater of Operation Medal with six campaign 
stars and a bronze arrowhead for the invasion 
of Southern France, as well as the French 
Fourage`re de Guerre. 
After the war, John attended the University 
of California at Davis Veterinary College, grad-
uating in its first class. He set up the first vet-
erinary clinic in Livermore, California and was 
knowns as ‘‘Doc Shirley’’ to the ranchers in 
the area. John was considered one of the best 
veterinarians in the region, with the toughest 
cases referred to him by his peers. 
John became active in the Livermore com-
munity, winning a seat on the Livermore City 
Council, where he served from 1958 until 
1966. He served as Livermore’s Mayor from 
1963 until 1966. 
He was a member of the Rotary Club and 
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). He led and 
was instrumental in many projects to improve 
the quality of life for Livermore residents and 
served on the VFW Honor Guard, firing gun 
salutes into his late seventies. John served as 
president of the Livermore Valley Opera, and 
as a member of the Livermore Symphony As-
sociation. 
As a member of the 3rd Infantry Division 
Veterans organization, he raised money for 
high school Junior ROTC programs in San 
Francisco and Oakland. He was also instru-
mental in creating the Veterans First program 
at Las Positas Community College to provide 
services to veterans returning to school. 
John loved sports, and was an avid skier, 
hiker, tennis player, and golfer. He was also a 
skilled instrument-rated pilot, which led him to 
further public service on the Livermore Airport 
Commission. John said, ‘‘You can be a bad 
golfer, skier, or tennis player, but you have to 
be a good pilot.’’ 
On July 13, 2019, Livermore City Council 
honored John by naming the new council 
chamber after him: The John Shirley City 
Council Chamber. John’s list of contributions 
and accomplishments are too long to list. He 
was the very embodiment of service to his 
community and to our great Nation. I invite my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the memory 
of this great American.

AUGUST DECEIT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, somehow in August the travesties of 
deceit by the Biden Administration are espe-
cially shocking, dangerous, and insulting to 
common sense. 
The abandonment of Afghanistan last year 
was the most horrific national security and for-
eign policy debacle in American history. Thir-
teen American servicemembers were mur-
dered and numerous others were left behind, 
as a familiar safe haven for terrorists was re- 
established as the one we gruesomely experi-
enced on September 11, 2001. 
Dangerous criminals on the Terrorist Watch 
List are now invading the open Southern bor-
der, as cartels are enriched with human traf-
ficking and fentanyl smuggling at the cost of 
American lives. 
The raid on the Trump Home on Monday is 
an inconceivable political assault on democ-
racy, repeating the hoax of Russian Collusion. 
FBI agents are abused as pawns by de-
ranged, political zealots. 
And on Wednesday, the absurd declaration 
by Biden of ‘‘zero inflation’’ is a disconnect 
from reality. Inflation is 8.5 percent, the high-
est in forty years. American families know gas-
oline is up 44 percent, electricity up 15.2 per-
cent, food up 13.1 percent, and transportation 
up 9.2 percent. 
Despite the universal definition of a reces-
sion in two quarters of GDP decline, Biden de-
nies the truth and persists with his failing 
agenda of raising taxes, borrowing, and foolish 
massive spending, sparking inflation and de-
stroying jobs. 
Sadly, the failures of Biden have created in-
conceivable threats at home and abroad and 
he should change policies immediately to pro-
tect American families.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated leader, Representative Orlando 
Paden. Rep. Paden has been a champion of 
service, education, and dedication to the great 
state of Mississippi and his community. 
Orlando W. Paden is a native of Clarksdale, 
MS, and the son of Cornelius and Lisa Paden. 
He has two sisters, Marquita Paden and 
Yusomie Caldwell. Mr. Paden is a proud 2002 
graduate 
of 
Coahoma 
Agricultural 
High 
School. 
Graduating 
with 
honors 
from 
Coahoma Community College in 2004; he 
went on to graduate Magna Cum Laude with 
a political science pre-law major from Alcorn 
State University in 2006. He also did graduate 
studies at Delta State University and Belhaven 
College. 
In 2015, he was elected to the Mississippi 
House of Representatives, District 26—serving 
Coahoma and Bolivar counties. Rep. Paden 
serves on eight committees: Agriculture, Pub-
lic Health and Human Services, Transpor-
tation, Tourism, and Universities and Colleges. 
During his term, he has been a staunch sup-
porter of public education, university and col-
lege funding, and health for all Mississippians. 
In 2018, Rep. Paden was selected as a Mis-
sissippi Legislator delegate to study govern-
ment abroad in Taiwan. In 2019, Rep. Paden 
was reelected to serve a second term. He 
lives by his motto, embodied through the 
words of Mahalia Jackson, ‘‘If I can help 
somebody, as I pass along; if I can cheer 
somebody, with a word or song; if I can show 
somebody, how they’re travelling wrong, then 
my living shall not be in vain.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Representative Orlando 
Paden for his support of public education, uni-
versity and college funding, and health for all 
Mississippians.

HONORING SHAMEKA WOODS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated leader, Shameka Woods. Ms. 
Shameka has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
achieve success. 
Shameka Woods is a 2003 graduate of 
Natchez High School. She received her bach-
elor’s degree from Jackson State University, a 
master’s degree from Alcorn State University, 
and a Specialist from Belhaven University. 
She is currently working on her Ed.D at 
Belhaven University. 
Shameka 
joined 
the 
Jefferson 
County 
School District in 2010 as a third-grade teach-
er. She has also served as SSIP Literacy 
Coach, Assistant Principal at Jefferson County 
High School, and now Principal at Jefferson 
County Elementary School. Shameka is a 
member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incor-
porated. She has a six-year-old daughter, 
Brooklyn, who attends Jefferson County Ele-
mentary School. 
Ms. Woods explained what drives her pas-
sion for educating children. She stated, ‘‘I do 
this work because our children need pas-
sionate educators in their lives. Our students 
have the potential to do anything they desire 
with the right motivation and support. My big-
gest reason (my why) is to see our students 
succeed. I am so blessed to have a team of 
educators who understand the vision (JCES 
Dream Team). I am also thankful to have sup-
port from the district administrators, who assist 
us with everything we do. With continuous 
teamwork and dedication, we will accomplish 
all our goals.’’ 
‘‘Ms. Woods is a visionary leader who sees 
the potential in every child,’’ said Adrian 
Hammitte, Superintendent of Jefferson County 
School District. Moreover, she has created a 
school culture centered around student suc-
cess. I am proud of her accomplishments and 
their impact on our school district and commu-
nity.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Shameka Woods for 
her passion and dedication to education in the 
Jefferson County School District.
