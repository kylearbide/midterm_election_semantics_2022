S6615 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2020 
No. 191 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Sovereign God, You are wisdom with-
out end and mercy without limit. We 
worship You. 
Lord, have compassion on our Na-
tion. Heal our physical, mental, and 
spiritual wounds. We are worn out from 
this challenging season. Restore us to 
the vision of a liberating freedom that 
enables justice to flourish. Hear the 
prayers of our Senators, and give them 
Your peace. And, Lord, thank You for 
the degree of resolution that has oc-
curred in our Nation’s election process. 
Remind us all of the wisdom of Mark 
3:25 that says, ‘‘A house divided against 
itself cannot stand.’’ 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PFIZER VACCINE TRIAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
morning, Pfizer announced positive re-
sults 
from 
its 
eagerly 
awaited 
coronavirus vaccine trial, with early 
data suggesting the vaccine is 90 per-
cent effective. 
This trial is taking place at over 120 
sites, including at the University of 
Iowa’s medical school. The University 
of Iowa’s portion is being led by Dr. Pa-
tricia Winokur, an infectious disease 
expert and associate dean. The trial in-
volves about 250 Iowans who have vol-
unteered to participate. The trial is 
not yet complete, but this is exciting 
news and an important step to halting 
the virus. 
I am proud of Iowa’s role in making 
sure the vaccine will be safe and effec-
tive. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, No-
vember is National Adoption Month. 
Each November, families across the 
country finalize adoptions and cele-
brate the creation of new families and 
connections. 
On 
National 
Adoption 
Day, which is celebrated on the Satur-
day before Thanksgiving, a special ef-
fort is made to finalize as many pend-
ing adoptions as possible. Last year, 
over 4,000 adoptions were finalized on 
that day. While I am sure that this day 
will look a little different this year due 
to the coronavirus, I am confident that 
family courts and child welfare agen-
cies will still make it a special day for 
many, many families—happy families— 
because they will be able to bring new 
ones into their families. 
The pandemic has created significant 
challenges for the children and families 
in our child welfare system. With trav-
el restrictions and limits on visitors in 
hospitals, adoptive parents are meeting 
their children for the first time ever 
over video chat instead of in person. 
Kids in foster care are having to wait 
longer for placements, and foster par-
ents are facing the added stress of 
school closures. Court proceedings are 
taking place over Zoom. Despite the 
challenges, both new challenges and 
old challenges that can accompany 
adoption, parents in Iowa and across 
the country are still making the choice 
to open their hearts and homes to chil-
dren in need. 
Congress has worked in the past to 
reduce barriers that would-be adoptive 
parents face. I will continue my efforts 
of making sure adoption remains an 
option for children in foster care who 
can’t be reunited with their families, 
women who are facing unexpected preg-
nancies, and all parents who are will-
ing and able to provide safe and loving 
homes for kids in need. There were 
over 100,000 children in the foster care 
system who were waiting for adoption 
in 2019. That 100,000 was approximately 
one-fourth of the number of kids in fos-
ter care. Congress must work in a bi-
partisan way, as it has for many years, 
to make sure adoption can become a 
reality, not just a dream, for all of 
these kids. We must also make sure 
that child welfare agencies have the 
tools and flexibilities they need to 
serve the families in their commu-
nities. 
For years in the Senate, I have 
worked to elevate the voices of youth 
in the foster care system. These young 
people are their own best advocates, 
and they can tell you that the thing 
they want the most is a caring and lov-
ing family and a permanent home. 
What would you expect from any of 
these young people who are moved 
from home to home maybe two or three 
times in a given year? 
As I continue to work in Congress to-
ward the goal of helping all children 
find their forever families, I will al-
ways keep the best interests of chil-
dren at the forefront.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
week record numbers of Americans ex-
ercised the right which generations 
risked everything to hand on to us. I 
want to spend a few minutes this morn-
ing talking about what we saw last 
week, where we are now, and where our 
great country will go from here. 
There is one aspect of last week that 
has gotten lost that I want to single 
out right at the start. By every indica-
tion, the 2020 election appears to be 
have been free from meaningful foreign 
interference. There is no suggestion 
that our foreign adversaries were al-
lowed to undermine the integrity of 
our process. 
According to the Director of the 
Cyber Security and Infrastructure Se-
curity Administration, ‘‘we have no’’— 
no—‘‘evidence any foreign adversary 
was capable of preventing Americans 
from voting or changing vote tallies.’’ 
GEN Paul Nakasone, the head of the 
NSA and U.S. Cyber Command reported 
Tuesday night, ‘‘The actions we have 
taken against adversaries . . . have en-
sured they’re not going to interfere in 
our elections.’’ 
The Trump administration and the 
Senate spent 4 years supporting the 
State and local election authorities on 
the frontlines: new tools and informa-
tion-sharing 
partnerships; 
unprece-
dented coordination; hundreds of mil-
lions in new funding; new, painful con-
sequences for bad actors, like Russia, if 
they interfere. 
The absence of any reports of foreign 
interference is a ringing endorsement— 
a ringing endorsement—of our bipar-
tisan work, and it slams the door on 
the embarrassing, irresponsible rhet-
oric that some Washington Democrats 
spent 4 years broadcasting. 
Too many voices tried to talk down 
our progress, urged Americans actually 
not to have confidence, and smeared 
anyone as unpatriotic who opposed far- 
left proposals to rewrite election laws. 
Well, the people who pushed this 
hysteria could not have more egg on 
their face than they do right now. None 
of their demands became law—none of 
them. The Speaker of the House did 
not get to personally rewrite election 
law. And yet, because of the sensible, 
bipartisan steps that some of us cham-
pioned, 
our 
defenses 
and 
counter-
measures proved to be in radically bet-
ter shape than back in 2016. 
So let’s talk about where we are now. 
According to preliminary results, vot-
ers across the Nation elected and re-
elected Republican Senators to a de-
gree that actually stunned prognos-
ticators. Likewise, the American peo-
ple seemed to have reacted to House 
Democrats’ radicalism and obstruction 
by shrinking the Speaker’s majority 
and electing more Republicans. 
And then there is the Presidential 
race. Obviously, no States have yet 
certified their election results. We 
have at least one or two States that 
are already on track for a recount, and 
I believe the President may have legal 
challenges underway in at least five 
States. 
The core principle here is not com-
plicated. In the United States of Amer-
ica, all legal ballots must be counted, 
any illegal ballots must not be count-
ed, the process should be transparent 
or observable by all sides, and the 
courts are here to work through con-
cerns. 
Our institutions are actually built 
for this. We have the system in place to 
consider 
concerns, 
and 
President 
Trump is 100 percent within his rights 
to look into allegations of irregular-
ities and weigh his legal options. 
Let’s go back 20 years ago. Twenty 
years ago, when Florida came down to 
a very thin margin, we saw Vice Presi-
dent Gore exhaust the legal system and 
wait to concede until December. 
More recently, weeks after the media 
had ‘‘called’’ President Bush’s reelec-
tion in 2004, Democrats baselessly dis-
puted Ohio’s electors and delayed the 
process here in Congress. 
In 2016 election laws saw recounts or 
legal challenges in several States. 
If any major irregularities occurred 
this time of a magnitude that would af-
fect the outcome, then every single 
American should want them to be 
brought to light. And if the Democrats 
feel confident they have not occurred, 
they should have no reason to fear any 
extra scrutiny. 
We have the tools and institutions we 
need to address any concerns. The 
President has every right to look into 
allegations and to request recounts 
under the law, and, notably, the Con-
stitution gives no role in this process 
to wealthy media corporations. 
The projections and commentary of 
the press do not get veto power over 
the legal rights of any citizen, includ-
ing the President of the United States. 
Now, more broadly, let’s not have 
any lectures—no lectures—about how 
the 
President 
should 
immediately, 
cheerfully accept preliminary election 
results, from the same characters who 
just spent 4 years refusing to accept 
the validity of the last election, and 
who insinuated that this one would be 
illegitimate too, if they lost again— 
only if they lost. So let’s have no lec-
tures on this subject from that contin-
gent. 
In late August, Secretary Hillary 
Clinton said: ‘‘Joe Biden should not 
concede under any circumstances . . . I 
think this is going to drag out, and . . . 
he will win it if we don’t give an inch.’’ 
That same month, Speaker PELOSI 
and the Democratic leader both stated: 
‘‘[President Trump] needs to cheat to 
win.’’ 
In October, when Speaker PELOSI was 
shopping some conspiracy theory about 
the Postal Service, she recklessly 
said—listen to this: ‘‘I have no doubt 
that the president . . . will lie, cheat, 
and steal, to win this election.’’ 
Now, does this sound like the chorus 
that has any credibility whatsoever to 
say a few legal challenges from Presi-
dent Trump represent some kind of cri-
sis? 
At this time last week, small busi-
ness owners in cities across America 
were boarding up their windows in case 
President Trump appeared to win and 
far-left mobs decided to reprise their 
summer rioting. 
Suffice it to say, a few legal inquiries 
from the President do not exactly spell 
the end of the Republic. 
Here is how two professors from 
Fordham Law School and New York 
Law School put it: ‘‘For centuries, we 
have asked people who are unhappy 
with their fellow citizens or govern-
ment agencies and institutions to bring 
their 
claims 
to 
court.’’ 
President 
Trump’s is ‘‘a traditional response that 
affirms rather than undermines Amer-
ican institutions.’’ 
This process will reach its resolution. 
Our system will resolve any recounts

or litigation. In January, the winner of 
this election will place his hand on a 
Bible, just like it has happened every 4 
years since 1793. 
What we know for sure is that the 
outcome is guaranteed to delight tens 
of millions of Americans and dis-
appoint tens of millions of Americans. 
But we also know that we will wake up 
on January 21, still blessed to live in 
the greatest Nation the world has ever 
seen. And in no small part, that is be-
cause we respect the rule of law, we 
trust our institutions, and neither of 
those things is outweighed by pro-
nouncements from partisans or the 
press. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Now, on an entirely different matter, 
Mr. President. The last several days 
have brought huge good news in our 
fight to beat this terrible virus. 
This morning, one drug manufacturer 
announced that ongoing trials suggest 
their candidate for a COVID–19 vaccine 
may be more than 90 percent effec-
tive—90 percent effective. 
This is a huge testament to the inge-
nuity of the American private sector 
and their global partners and to the 
historic efforts of Congress and the 
Trump administration. We flattened 
regulatory roadblocks, we sped up 
trials, and laid ground work to buy and 
distribute a vaccine as fast as possible. 
Last week, we learned the unemploy-
ment rate has fallen to 6.9 percent—6.9 
percent—with more than 630,000 new 
jobs added just in the month of Octo-
ber. Now, remember back in the spring-
time, 
many 
experts 
estimated 
we 
would still be saddled with double-digit 
joblessness through the end of this 
year. It turns out the news is a whole 
lot better, another testament to the 
strong economic foundations that Con-
gress and the Trump administration 
spent 3 years laying before the pan-
demic struck and most of all to the re-
silience—the incredible resilience of 
the American people. 
So, to be clear, our work is not fin-
ished. Too many Americans are still 
suffering economically, and infections 
are climbing across the country. We 
cannot give up on commonsense meas-
ures like wearing masks just because 
we have grown tired of them. 
The Senate is going to have a busy 
few weeks. I hope our Democratic col-
leagues will finally put aside their all- 
or-nothing obstruction and let the tar-
geted pandemic relief—targeted pan-
demic relief is what we need—let it 
move forward. 
In any event, we will need to fund the 
government, reach agreement with the 
House on the National Defense Author-
ization Act, and confirm more thor-
oughly qualified nominees. 
So I welcome all my colleagues back 
to the Chamber, and I look forward to 
finishing this year strong. Our States 
and our country are counting on us. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
Tuesday, our country conducted the 
most sacred process in our democratic 
system of government, a national elec-
tion. 
It was an election unlike any other 
in modern history. Much of the voting 
was done before election day itself, as 
the global pandemic forced States to 
adjust their balloting and voting proce-
dures. The counting of the vote took a 
little longer than most Americans 
might have expected or hoped. Indeed, 
some of the final tabulations are not 
yet complete. It is still to be deter-
mined which party will hold the major-
ity in this Chamber. 
But we do know a few things. First 
and most importantly, former Vice 
President Joseph Robinette Biden will 
become the 46th President of the 
United States. Our dear colleague, the 
distinguished Senator from California, 
KAMALA HARRIS, will be the next Vice 
President of the United States. And on 
January 20, the country will finally— 
finally—turn the page on one of the 
most divisive and chaotic chapters in 
our history. 
President-Elect Joe Biden has told 
the country that it is time to come to-
gether and heal, to unify once again to 
fight not our political opponents but 
our common enemies: disease and pov-
erty and injustice. There is no person 
better suited to the task than the 
former Vice President. He will be a 
great President for all Americans. 
Vice President-Elect HARRIS, mean-
while, has just made history four times 
over. She will be the first African- 
American woman, the first Asian- 
American woman, the first biracial 
woman, and the first woman, period, to 
ever serve as Vice President of the 
United States. 
I congratulate the former Vice Presi-
dent, his wife Jill, our colleague Sen-
ator HARRIS, and her husband Doug on 
their hard-fought victory. 
More Americans voted for President- 
Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect 
HARRIS than any ticket in our Nation’s 
history. They have given them an enor-
mous burden and a decisive mandate to 
take the reins of the executive branch 
and marshal this government into ac-
tion—for they will assume the high of-
fices of the Presidency and the Vice 
Presidency at a time of unprecedented 
challenge. 
Our great Nation faces the greatest 
economic crisis in 75 years and the 
greatest public health crisis in a cen-
tury. 
Extraordinary 
inequalities 
of 
wealth and income strike at the heart 
of the idea of America as a land of 
equal opportunity. Racial disparities in 
our society strike at the heart of the 
idea of America as a place of equal jus-
tice. Climate change threatens the 
very future of our planet. 
The American people have placed 
their faith in President-Elect Biden to 
confront those challenges head-on: to 
relieve their suffering, to repair our de-
mocracy, to recover our economy, and 
rebuild the country and a planet for 
this generation and for the next. I have 
no doubt their faith will be rewarded, 
but I also have no doubt that the task 
ahead is daunting. 
CORONAVIRUS 
While the country prepares for a 
change in administration, it must also 
brace for the darkest days of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Over the weekend, 
the United States recorded its 10 mil-
lionth case. We are now confirming 
nearly 100,000 new cases of COVID per 
day, on track to eclipse more than a 
million cases per week. 
As exhausted and impatient as we all 
are for our lives and livelihoods to re-
turn to normal, experts are warning us 
that the worst phase is still ahead. The 
quickest way to turn the tide, crush 
the virus, and get back to normal is to 
do what we should have been doing all 
along: take the virus seriously, listen 
to the scientists, and dedicate the nec-
essary resources to get the job done. 
President-Elect Biden is already pre-
paring to do just that. Today, he 
named several health experts and sci-
entific advisers to serve on a COVID–19 
task force. It sends the right signal 
that while the President-elect will not 
assume office for another few months, 
his administration will hit the ground 
running, and its policy on COVID–19 
will refreshingly be dictated by facts 
and by science. 
It is a major turning point that soon 
we will have an administration that ac-
tually acknowledges that this is a 
healthcare crisis; that knows our econ-
omy won’t fully recover until we solve 
it. I am confident that a Biden admin-
istration will do that, but Congress 
must play its part too. 
Nearly 15 million Americans have 
lost health insurance through their 
employer. Democrats have a solution 
to that problem. Let’s get it done and 
make sure those families have health 
coverage. 
Medicaid Programs across the coun-
try are experiencing a huge influx of 
new enrollees, while State budgets 
struggle to bear the added costs. The 
Heroes Act ensures that Medicaid is 
strengthened and secured for the dura-
tion of this pandemic. Let’s get that 
done too. 
And today, we received news that the 
entire world has been waiting for. A 
U.S. company has developed a vaccine 
for COVID–19 that, according to the 
preliminary research and the news re-
ports, is 90 percent effective. The FDA 
said it would approve a vaccine that 
was 50 percent effective. So while the 
FDA needs to review the vaccine, to 
have a vaccine that is 90 percent effec-
tive is about as good as it gets. 
We Democrats will do everything we 
can to make sure this vaccine or any

vaccine is distributed quickly, fairly, 
equitably, and the challenge is now one 
of scale and one of delivery. Congress 
should fund a national vaccination pro-
gram, and the administration, whether 
it is the Trump administration or the 
Biden administration, must do every-
thing to reach minority and under-
served communities, combat vaccine 
hesitancy, and ensure that the vaccines 
are free to everyone. This will be a 
massive and complex undertaking un-
like anything that our country has 
seen, and we must all work together— 
from the President to Congress, down 
to local community health depart-
ments—to ensure that it gets done 
right and it gets done fairly and it gets 
done equitably. 
So while the incoming administra-
tion prepares to take on the surge of 
COVID–19, 
Congress 
should 
pass 
a 
strong, comprehensive COVID relief 
bill that actually meets the needs of 
the American people. 
When it comes to health care, edu-
cation, testing, tracing, unemployment 
benefits, 
and 
many 
other 
critical 
issues, this Republican majority has 
proposed totally inadequate solutions. 
As the disease surges across our coun-
try once again, there is no time for in-
adequate solutions. 
I hope, now that the election is be-
hind us, our colleagues are ready to 
come together in a search for an ade-
quate bipartisan solution rather than 
the partisan, stunt-voting legislating 
we 
have 
suffered 
these 
past 
few 
months. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Now I must spend a moment on 
something that will garner too much 
attention over the next few weeks: 
baseless claims by the President and 
his supporters that there has been 
widespread voter fraud and that the 
election was somehow rigged or stolen 
from President Trump. 
That kind of rhetoric is extremely 
dangerous and extremely poisonous to 
our democracy. As in any campaign, 
the President has a right to bring legal 
challenges or request recounts where 
State law allows. However, there is no 
legal right to file frivolous claims. 
Lawsuits must have a basis in facts 
and evidence. And make no mistake, 
there has been no evidence of any sig-
nificant or widespread voter fraud. 
Joe Biden won this election fair and 
square. The margins of his victory are 
growing by the day, and former Presi-
dent George W. Bush, commendably, 
acknowledged that fact when he con-
gratulated President-Elect Biden and 
Vice President-Elect HARRIS on their 
victory. 
Now Republican leaders in Congress 
should also do the right thing. Repub-
lican leaders must unequivocally con-
demn the President’s rhetoric and 
work to ensure the peaceful transfer of 
power on January 20. I have been heart-
ened to see a few of my Republican col-
leagues—it is three, I believe—con-
gratulate the winning ticket, but too 
many, including the Republican leader, 
have been silent or sympathetic to the 
President’s fantasies. 
Even some nonpartisan members of 
the current administration have re-
fused to move forward with the formal 
process for the incoming administra-
tion. According to the Washington 
Post, the Administrator of the General 
Services Administration has declined 
to sign a letter allowing President- 
elect Joe Biden’s transition team to 
formally begin its work. 
It does not matter whether the Presi-
dent is happy about the results of the 
election. 
The 
peaceful 
transfer 
of 
power is a hallmark—the bedrock—of 
our democracy, and it must proceed 
unimpeded. The GSA Administrator 
should 
sign 
the 
paperwork 
imme-
diately in order to allow the important 
work of the Presidential transition to 
proceed. 
America remains in the middle of a 
worsening health and economic crisis, 
and there is no excuse—none—for the 
outgoing administration to impede the 
new administration’s preparations to 
deal with these urgent challenges. 
There is no law or requirement that 
President Trump concede the election 
or leave the Office of the Presidency 
with grace, but as history prepares to 
write the final few sentences on the 
Trump Presidency, it will surely note 
how this President and his Republican 
allies here in Congress treated our de-
mocracy on his way out the door. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe 
under our original agreement, I am rec-
ognized next. Is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate what the Democratic leader has 
said. I was willing to step aside earlier 
when I had the floor because I under-
stood the two leaders were coming to 
speak. It was a matter of courtesy to 
them, and I know the Democratic lead-
er, at least, appreciated that. 
Let me agree with what he said. You 
know, when I came here, the President 
of the United States was an unelected 
President, and there was an unelected 
Vice President. It was Jerry Ford. And 
then, under the change in our law since 
President Kennedy’s death, he was able 
to pick an unelected Vice President. I 
remember Democrats and Republicans 
alike welcoming him and saying: Let’s 
go forward. 
I have been here with each Presi-
dent—some reelected, some not—and, 
in every instance, I see the outgoing 
President 
welcoming 
the 
incoming 
President, Republican or Democrat, 
and they have done it to try to make as 
smooth a transition not for their own 
political purposes but for the good of 
the United States of America. Every-
one has done that. 
I think it was George H.W. Bush wel-
coming Bill Clinton, who defeated him. 
I remember Al Gore had more votes 
than George W. Bush, but after the 
Court had ruled, he graciously con-
ceded to George W. Bush. I remember 
Hillary Clinton, with well over 2 mil-
lion more votes than Donald Trump, 
but saying that here is what the elec-
toral college is and conceded. 
Now we see Joseph Biden, with more 
votes than anybody has ever gotten in 
the history of the United States for 
President, and the incumbent Presi-
dent goes off golfing again and again 
and pretends he doesn’t have to step 
back, and, in fact, actually does every-
thing possible to make it difficult for 
the new President to handle the transi-
tion. 
That is wrong. Just as I have encour-
aged both Democrats and Republicans 
as President, you help the incoming 
President with transition, not for your 
political reasons or their political rea-
sons but for the good of all of us as 
Americans. They are saying: Oh, no, we 
are going to hold the key to the door of 
the transition office. 
Every Republican and every Demo-
crat voted for the money for that tran-
sition office so that whoever is Presi-
dent could step forward and not hurt 
the country by coming in without 
doing the necessary preparation. They 
are like a little child in a playground: 
No, we got the key; we got the key. We 
are not going to share the key. 
Oh, come on. Do you know how this 
makes us look to the rest of the world? 
Do you know how it makes us look in 
my State of Vermont, where some Re-
publicans voted for Donald Trump and 
some voted for Joe Biden? The major-
ity voted, in this case, for Joe Biden. 
But 
I 
have 
been 
hearing 
from 
Vermonters all over from both parties: 
What is going on? It is over. It is done 
for the country. 
In that regard, let me just speak 
briefly about the President-elect and 
the Vice President-elect. When I came 
to this body, I was the most junior 
Member of the U.S. Senate and the sec-
ond youngest. The youngest was a Sen-
ator from Delaware who had been 
elected just 2 years before, Joe Biden. I 
think of the fact that we were the two 
youngest, and we bonded over that, and 
I got to know his family. 
I knew of the tragedy he had when 
his first wife and daughter were killed. 
He would go home every day to make 
sure that he could put his sons to bed 
and be there with them. I don’t know 
how many times we would be standing 
down there in the well, and he was 
looking at his watch, and he said: What 
time do you think the last votes are 
going to be, because the next train to 
Delaware is at such and such time? He 
was like a marathon runner going out 
the door to make sure he got the train, 
which he did, to be home to take care 
of his children. 
I remember how happy Marcelle and 
I were when we met Jill—what a won-
derful woman. Dr. Biden was every-
thing you would want in a First Lady 
in this country. We had the privilege of 
traveling with both of them and seeing 
the love and the joy they had in each 
other’s company, the love and the joy

they have shown in their children and 
grandchildren, 
and 
continue 
to. 
I 
watched Joe Biden, with a sense of dig-
nity, as he ran for election to the Pres-
idency, an office he had hoped to hold 
and probably thought he never would. 
I know that he wanted to run 4 years 
ago, but it was too close to the time of 
losing his son Beau. I had the privilege 
of knowing Beau. In fact, the last time 
I talked to him was on one of the bat-
tlefields in Iraq where he was serving 
in combat for our U.S. military. I told 
him at that time: You know, when I 
get back on the plane, I am going to 
call your father. I always do this when 
I meet a Vermonter in a war zone. I 
call their family and say they are 
doing well. I will call your dad and tell 
him. 
When I got on the plane and con-
nected with the White House operator, 
I remember then-Vice President Biden 
coming on. After a ways, he said: I 
know what you are going to say. I got 
an email from Beau. 
I remember when Marcelle and I 
stood there and tears went down her 
face listening to President Obama eulo-
gizing Beau at his funeral. We all felt 
as part of that family. So there was joy 
in the Leahy household when he was 
elected—not just a joy for the good of 
the country but the joy of seeing a per-
son whom we know, love, and respect 
elected as President. 
And added to that is the added ad-
vantage of KAMALA HARRIS, one of our 
Senate colleagues here. I remember 
when Senator HARRIS came to the Sen-
ate, and I was so happy to see her going 
on the Judiciary Committee because 
she had been such a good prosecutor 
and such a good attorney general. She 
was a woman who didn’t need to have 
much of an orientation. She knew ex-
actly what she was doing. 
We have gotten to know her and her 
husband and admire her so. Then, when 
she spoke—as they accepted the fact 
that they were President and Vice 
President-elect—she said how proud 
she was to be there with President- 
Elect Biden and how proud she was to 
speak about her background and her 
immigrant parents coming here, the 
different races shown in her back-
ground, and what she was saying, as 
she said, to ‘‘women everywhere.’’ But 
I would say also what she shows to 
young women, those not old enough to 
vote, like my granddaughters, and they 
can look at that and say: That shows 
everything is open. 
You know, I come from a State where 
it is unusual to be elected the first 
time because, well, I am the only Dem-
ocrat ever elected to the U.S. Senate in 
Vermont’s history, and the youngest 
also. I wasn’t supposed to win. We were 
overwhelmingly a Republican State 
then. We have become now one of both 
parties. In the last election, for exam-
ple, there was a Republican Governor. 
This year, in the last few days, our Re-
publican Governor won overwhelm-
ingly, and Molly Gray, a young woman 
that started out as an intern in my of-
fice and went to the University of 
Vermont, won comfortably and by a 
comfortable margin as a Democrat. 
But also, our Republican Governor said 
on election day that for the good of the 
country, to stop the dissension, to 
lower the kind of rhetoric we were 
hearing, he was going to vote for Jo-
seph Biden. 
Now, I mention that just as a micro-
cosm in our State. But to go back to 
just a purely personal thing, Marcelle 
and I prayed for that day. We were so 
happy to see our friends. We were so 
happy to know they were there. And, as 
one who has known Joe Biden from the 
day I came into the Senate, I still re-
member, to this day, his coming over 
to greet me on the floor and saying: I 
am glad to see us young people here. I 
was about a year or so older than he, 
and we were sitting kind of in the jun-
ior role, and that friendship has lasted 
ever since. 
I know Joe Biden. I know Jill Biden. 
I know the United States of America, 
and at a time when we are so torn 
apart, these are two people who can 
bring us back together. 
I know KAMALA HARRIS. We know her 
wonderful husband. And here, my good-
ness, what a broad spectrum right 
there. In one way, it is unique. In an-
other way, it is not the least bit 
unique. It is the face of America. It is 
the face of America. The diversity in 
our country of race, religion, every-
thing—it is reflected in this ticket. It 
couldn’t be better for the beginning of 
this century to have such a wide spec-
trum shown in the President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
I think of what the mayor of Paris 
said. She issued a statement sort of to 
the effect of ‘‘Welcome back, Amer-
ica.’’ Well, this is an America that rep-
resents all of us. We should all get to-
gether to try to make it successful. If 
Senators disagree on a particular issue, 
vote up or down, but have the courage 
to vote. Have the courage to vote. 
Don’t do what we have done this past 
year, refusing to vote on COVID as 
thousands upon thousands upon thou-
sands of people die in our country. 
Have the courage to get up and vote. 
Vote yes or no. 
We are here with 6-year terms. We 
ought to at least have the courage to 
vote yes or no. And then let’s take a 
pause and say that these are the two 
who will be the face of America from 
noon, January 20. 
From a personal point of view, that 
face reflects very much our family— 
our children and our grandchildren. I 
can see them in these four people, and 
I am proud of that. 
I will admit that I have gotten a few 
emails from my Irish friends to say 
how much they are looking forward to 
a President Biden coming to Ireland, 
and they have forgiven me my Italian 
half with that. But I know that when I 
heard 
Joe 
Biden 
quoting 
Seamus 
Heaney during his campaign, I remem-
ber that he knows those Irish roots. 
But he, like his family, are first and 
foremost Americans. Like his late, 
wonderful son Beau, they are first and 
foremost Americans. 
KAMALA HARRIS speaks of her family, 
her ancestors coming here, her mother 
and father coming here, coming not to 
be anything other than Americans. 
They are as American as she is. She is 
as American as any of us. 
I will close with this. Isn’t it time 
the United States of America—a coun-
try that has become as diverse as you 
can imagine—can show their face to 
the rest of the world and say: This is 
who we are. And my grandchildren— 
my White grandchildren and my Black 
grandchildren—can look and say: Yes, 
that is who we are. 
Joe and KAMALA, in a few days I will 
call you Mr. President and Madam Vice 
President, and I will do it with great 
pride. But I say today to my dear 
friends Joe and KAMALA: Congratula-
tions. This Vermonter is very, very 
happy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, we may be back to work carrying 
out what should be the normal business 
of the Senate, but from what I have ob-
served, the American people really 
don’t see this as just another day. They 
are a little bit anxious, and I really 
think that it is because, over the past 
week, they have witnessed some of the 
most divisive news cycles in recent 
memory. 
Allegations of voter fraud are run-
ning rampant. These have been unan-
swered and ignored by most media out-
lets. Liberal operatives have sent up 
test balloons on the creation of official 
enemies lists. Think about that. We 
have them making enemies lists, want-
ing to execute a campaign of personal 
destruction against people with whom 
they disagree. What does that say 
about treasuring free speech? 
The most popular social media plat-
forms—oh—have honestly just outdone 
themselves by making matters worse 
by slapping these scary labels on con-
tent that is meant to inform and to 
spark bipartisan debate. 
Then you have email services that 
are locking down access to email lists 
because the distribution is something 
with which they disagree. This is what 
has happened to millions of Americans. 
They gasp every time they see these 
markers on content, when they can’t 
get to an email list, when they hear 
about a group they belong to that they 
can’t hear from or communicate with. 
Yes, it is censorship, and it is some-
thing that has divided people, families,

neighbors, friends, coworkers, and col-
leagues. 
I will tell you, many of them remain 
divided, but I think we have to say 
they have been engaged. According to 
the Pew Research Center, Americans 
participated in this election cycle at 
the highest rate in 120 years. Election 
officials still haven’t finished their 
counts, and already we know that more 
than 144 million ballots were cast this 
cycle. 
I would venture to say that many of 
those 
millions 
of 
individuals 
are 
watching us. They want to see what we 
are going to do next, how we are going 
to conduct ourselves. They don’t really 
care if it takes a little multitasking; 
they are saying it is time for Congress 
to do its job. 
You can look at all of the exit polling 
on the favorability ratings of Congress. 
I will say it is discouragingly low—the 
regard in which the American people 
hold their elected representatives col-
lective body. It is time for us to get 
some things done. 
Judging by the footage of demonstra-
tions in many of America’s major cit-
ies, you might not remember that we 
are still dealing with the effects of a 
global pandemic. It seems that for a 
few days, people forgot there is a pan-
demic. 
Democrats in the House and the Sen-
ate have wasted months of precious 
time obstructing the passage of tar-
geted COVID relief legislation that 
Tennesseans and New Yorkers and 
Californians and every other American 
who owns a business or supports a fam-
ily needs not tomorrow or today; they 
needed it yesterday, last week, last 
month. 
I have spent the past several months 
coming to this floor to tell the stories 
of Tennesseans, Tennessee small busi-
ness people, Tennessee employers who 
are desperately in need of relief, trying 
to help my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle understand that there is 
fear and pain in certain sectors of our 
economy. It is really so inappropriate 
that those fears and that pain are 
something they have chosen to ignore. 
To be frank, it has been like talking to 
a brick wall. There has been no re-
sponse. 
Just last week, I met with the board 
of the Academy of Country Music for a 
very hard discussion about the future 
of their industry. Not one single venue 
or one studio musician or one sound 
engineer—their whole industry shut 
down. This is an industry that has shut 
down. They did nothing wrong, mind 
you. They showed up for work. They 
built businesses. They hired people. 
They used independent contractors. 
They paid their bills. They paid their 
taxes. They did nothing wrong. But the 
entertainment 
industry—live 
enter-
tainment—is shut down. 
This isn’t the huge record labels and 
big 
entertainment 
companies 
that 
many people think are the music in-
dustry. These are the mom-and-pops. 
These are the small businesses, the sole 
proprietors, the independent contrac-
tors. These are the people who set up 
and tear down stages. They put on 
these amazing sound and light displays 
that people get so excited about seeing 
and that really make music and enter-
tainment come to life. They produce 
the music that you walk around listen-
ing to in your earbuds. The support 
staff at the venues clean up your beer 
cans and ticket stubs after you have 
enjoyed a show. I tell you, they also 
are the artists, the storytellers, and I 
really think our creative and cultural 
historians. 
This industry is absolutely dying. 
They are not the only ones. There are 
so many other sectors of our economy 
that are at a standstill. They are suf-
fering, and so many other people have 
been suffering. They are tired of what 
they see as posturing here in DC, using 
the hurt and the suffering of people as 
just a political bargaining chip. Do you 
know what? They have noticed. They 
have been watching over the past few 
months. They know that very little has 
been accomplished, and they think it is 
time to stop putting politics over peo-
ple. It is time to stop saying ‘‘We want 
the issue if it is good for us’’ because 
people are looking for solutions. 
They were waiting for a mandate— 
our friends over on the left—a mandate 
they were sure was going to come their 
way on November 3, but the American 
people refused to deliver them a man-
date. You see it in elections that took 
place at the local and the State level. 
You see it in the congressional elec-
tions and certainly here in this Cham-
ber. 
So far, Speaker PELOSI has refused 
any offer to compromise. Every offer 
and gesture that has been made by the 
White House or this Chamber has been 
refused. She has clung to that $3 tril-
lion parody of a relief bill that she has 
stuffed to the brim with billions for lib-
eral pet projects that have nothing to 
do with COVID recovery—nothing at 
all. Isn’t it interesting that her pet 
project is not the American people? 
Wouldn’t you think she would want to 
solve some of these problems? But no— 
she would rather play politics. 
This absurd delay has come at great 
cost. We have so many Tennesseans, in-
deed, across this country, millions of 
families and small businesses that will 
tell you they are in damage control 
mode because Democrats refuse to 
allow them the dignity of hope that 
targeted relief would provide. ‘‘Dig-
nity’’—that is a nice word. And we 
have so many people who are grasping, 
trying to pay their bills, keep their 
businesses alive. I will say that our 
friends across the aisle twice—twice, 
twice—have declined to vote for tar-
geted relief. 
It is not too late to step up on behalf 
of those who have lost just about ev-
erything and those who still have a 
shot at coming out on the other side of 
this pandemic with their livelihoods 
intact. It is not too late to pass legisla-
tion that would provide better unem-
ployment insurance, more help for 
small businesses, resources for schools 
and universities, vaccine research fund-
ing, testing funding, and liability pro-
tection—targeted relief for millions of 
Americans who have said: This what 
we need in order to keep people em-
ployed and to keep our businesses open. 
The legislation is written. All that 
needs to happen is our friends across 
the aisle need to say: We are ready to 
vote on this package. Let’s do another 
round of PPP. Let’s do a plus-up in un-
employment. Let’s do that money for 
vaccines and testing and resources for 
schools and universities. Let’s give 
companies the liability protection they 
need to open their doors. Let’s give 
these entertainment venues the liabil-
ity protection they need in order to 
again get on the road, have concerts, 
play that music Americans love to lis-
ten to. It is there. 
To my friends, let’s have no filibus-
ters, no more distractions, and no more 
extravagant wish lists of pet projects. 
For goodness’ sake, put your politics 
aside, and let’s put the people first. 
Let’s provide the relief they are seek-
ing. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REELECTION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, be-
fore I make my remarks, I want to 
take a moment on the floor of the Sen-
ate to formally and officially thank 
the people of the State of Illinois for 
electing me to another term in the U.S. 
Senate. 
On election night, when the results 
were apparent, I went and stared into 
an iPad to announce my victory 
speech. It was unlike anything I had 
ever been through in a campaign, and I 
said so. It was an extraordinary cam-
paign experience, made even more dif-
ficult and challenging because of the 
pandemic crisis. I want to thank the 
people of the State for standing by me 
and giving me this chance to serve 
again. 
I am honored to serve my State in 
this body, especially during this time 
of transition in America and transition 
around the world. Together, with a 
trust in science with the Biden-Harris 
administration, we will return to our 
national agenda. I am eager to con-
tinue working to help the families, 
small businesses, schools, hospitals, 
and constituents in my State and to 
help all of us in this country endure 
this pandemic together. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, COVID–19 did not 
take a day off for the election. While 
election week was brewing and all of us 
were glued to our television screens,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6621 
November 9, 2020 
most of the country was unaware of the 
fact that the COVID–19 pandemic was 
worsening. Cases of the virus and hos-
pitalizations in the United States have 
been spiking for weeks now. On Satur-
day, we hit the highest daily total of 
new cases—126,000 new cases on Satur-
day. In Illinois, we are approaching 
half a million cases. The State has 
tragically seen more than 10,000 of our 
neighbors and friends die from this 
COVID–19. The country is on pace to 
hit 1 million new cases every week by 
the end of this year. 
This is disastrous, and it demands ac-
tion. 
Thankfully, 
President-Elect 
Biden has announced an extraordinary 
task force of respected public health 
and medical experts—truth tellers, real 
leaders. Like the NIH’s Dr. Fauci, I 
trust Dr. Kessler, David Kessler, whom 
I have known for decades; Dr. Morita, 
who served so admirably in the city of 
Chicago; Dr. Atul Gawande, one of my 
real heroes in medicine today—I have 
spent a lot of money on his books and 
have never regretted a penny of it; and 
former Surgeon General Murthy—what 
an extraordinarily talented man he is 
and the others who are part of the 
team. 
Yet we need to continue to stay safe 
and remember that this virus is not 
anywhere near being gone. There are 10 
million Americans who have now con-
tracted the virus, and we have lost 
238,000 American lives. My heart goes 
out to everyone who has lost someone 
in this pandemic and to those who are 
still suffering due to this virus. 
In addition to the health and safety 
of the American people, we have also 
been struggling to deal with real eco-
nomic uncertainty, job losses, food in-
security, stress, and childcare. It is a 
long list. Despite these urgent needs of 
families, small businesses, workers, 
health 
providers, 
and 
unemployed 
Americans across the country, unfortu-
nately, the leadership in this Chamber 
has dragged its feet and offered only a 
few very weak measures that barely 
address the overwhelming needs of this 
Nation. This is why Americans have 
not received another round of economic 
impact payments, rental assistance, or 
enhanced 
unemployment 
assistance, 
and it is why hospitals are not receiv-
ing additional funding. 
Speaker PELOSI and House Democrats 
passed the Heroes Act in May—a $3.4 
trillion relief package. After negoti-
ating with the White House, they then 
passed the second version of that—a 
$2.2 trillion package. Unfortunately, 
the Senate majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, refused to consider either 
of these proposals and even refused to 
attend the negotiating sessions. The 
last Senate Republican response was 
inadequate—$500 billion. It may seem 
like a fortune until you look at a na-
tion in the midst of a pandemic and at 
an economy struggling to survive. 
If the Republicans are serious about 
negotiating a real package—if they 
want to demonstrate to the American 
people what leadership looks like, with 
real solutions for real problems that 
families face—then I call on Senator 
MCCONNELL to show up to the negoti-
ating table and give up these rogue at-
tempts to pass empty, halfhearted 
measures. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board, Jerome Powell, a conservative 
Republican economist, has repeatedly 
warned of potentially dire economic 
consequences if additional fiscal relief 
is delayed. As hiring begins to pick up 
in a few sectors—thank goodness—too 
many populations, including African- 
American workers, Hispanic men, and 
women with children, are being left be-
hind. 
We need to focus on helping the 
American people through this pan-
demic. We need to do it now. This is 
the so-called lameduck session between 
the results of an election and the 
swearing-in of a new Congress and 
President, but shame on us if we don’t 
use this time together in Washington 
as an opportunity to do more than vote 
for a random Republican judge. Can’t 
we roll up our sleeves on a bipartisan 
basis and realize what is really hap-
pening across America as this pan-
demic heats up and more Americans 
die every day? 
We need at least $75 billion for addi-
tional testing and contact tracing to 
slow the spread of COVID–19—far more 
than the meager $16 billion that was of-
fered in the Republican measure. 
We also want to put $57 billion in for 
hospitals, clinics, and health providers. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, I was on 
the phone with these administrators. 
They are desperate. We are going to 
lose hospitals across this country and, 
I fear, maybe even in our own State if 
we don’t step forward and do some-
thing. 
What is wrong with increasing, at 
least to some degree, the amount avail-
able for food stamps—the so-called 
SNAP program—so that hundreds of 
millions of Americans who go to food 
banks to survive get a helping hand? Is 
that too much to ask in the month of 
Thanksgiving and in the month of 
Christmas? 
We must also include more economic 
support for households through a sec-
ond round of economic impact pay-
ments and through reinstating en-
hanced unemployment benefits. 
I continue to hear about struggles 
from hospitals that are on the brink, 
from workers who have lost their jobs, 
and from small business owners who 
are desperately trying to keep their 
heads above water. Unfortunately, the 
Senate continues to waste time on pro-
posals that place the needs of Big Busi-
ness ahead of the needs of small fami-
lies. History will judge this body on 
how we respond—not on the best 
speech given on the floor—or on how 
we failed to respond to the worst pan-
demic in a century and the deepest re-
cession in 75 years. 
The American people are looking for 
leadership. We cannot let them down. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Madam President, there is another 
aspect of this that I would like to ad-
dress for just a moment. 
After 
each 
Presidential 
election, 
there is a transition period when a new 
President is coming in and his team 
takes a look at the government as it 
stands and prepares for the day of Jan-
uary 20, when that new President will 
be sworn in. All of the networks and 
major news sources have declared Joe 
Biden to be the President-elect and 
KAMALA
HARRIS, our colleague here 
from the Senate, to be the Vice Presi-
dent-elect. They are now bringing to-
gether the people who are their experts 
to prepare for a smooth, orderly transi-
tion. 
Before that can take place, the Ad-
ministrator of the General Services Ad-
ministration 
must 
file 
something 
called an ascertainment that ascer-
tains in fact there was an election and 
someone won. In most cases, it is very 
routine. It is just done automatically 
based on the reports from the States 
that we already have as we sat busily 
by the TV, day after day, doing our 
emails and texting to friends and fami-
lies, waiting for the returns to come in. 
The announcement was made on Satur-
day, and the reaction was all across the 
country. 
You would think that the Adminis-
trator of the GSA would have the as-
certainment necessary to really pull 
the trigger for a transition from the 
Trump administration to the incoming 
Biden administration. These are rou-
tine things that have gone on in past 
years 
without 
really 
much 
con-
troversy. Yet, lo and behold, this year, 
there is controversy. 
For the past 60 years, since Congress 
passed the Presidential Transition Act 
to ensure a smooth and orderly trans-
fer of power, the GSA Administrator 
has usually ascertained the apparent 
winner within 24 hours of the election. 
By passing the Presidential Transition 
Act, Congress has acknowledged how 
critical this period is for the safety and 
well-being of the country. Once the 
GSA makes this ascertainment, the ex-
ecutive branch can provide crucial 
services to the transition team to 
make sure there is a smooth transfer. 
Remember when I mentioned earlier 
that we are in the midst of a pandemic, 
with thousands of people dying? Why 
would we want to see a delay or some 
bureaucratic indecision that might 
jeopardize a person’s health or a per-
son’s life in the midst of this pan-
demic? 
Once the GSA makes that ascertain-
ment to provide services, it includes 
access to classified information for in-
coming 
national 
security 
officials; 
background investigations and security 
clearances 
for 
potential 
nominees; 
State Department-facilitated foreign 
leader calls; access to SCIFs and Fed-
eral agencies for discussions on per-
sonnel, budget, and policy; and access

to $6.3 million of congressionally ap-
proved funds to support transition ac-
tivities and to actually buy office 
equipment. 
Delayed ascertainment, as I men-
tioned, could also prevent the transi-
tion team from meeting with agency 
officials who will be responsible for the 
COVID–19 crisis. Shouldn’t they get up 
to speed on Operation Warp Speed and 
on the announcement today by Pfizer 
that it is on the verge of announcing a 
successful vaccine? Don’t we want an 
orderly, peaceful, smooth, effective, 
and efficient transition when it comes 
to the manufacturing and distribution 
of that vaccine? Of course, we do. 
A delayed ascertainment will cause 
major harm to this transition, to the 
new Biden administration, and to the 
American people. It could be a danger 
to our national security. Why would we 
ever risk that? 
On November 27, 2000, when there was 
an actual controversy in the States 
and in the courts over 500 or 600 votes 
in Florida, for example, Vice Presi-
dent-Elect Dick Cheney said about the 
transition being delayed at all: ‘‘We 
will pay a heavy price for the delays in 
planning and assembling the next ad-
ministration.’’ 
It has been a bitter campaign, a 
tough campaign. People still have very 
strong personal feelings about its out-
comes. Some people are euphoric, and 
others are angry and sad. I know that 
is natural in an election campaign, and 
I feel that way about some of the races 
back in my home State. Yet there 
comes a moment when we have to look 
after the best interests of this country, 
and the best interests of this country 
say we should move forward on the 
transition at this moment. 
I believe that President-Elect Joe 
Biden will be sworn in on January 20 as 
our next President. I believe the num-
bers are overwhelming. The margins in 
even the controversial States are so 
large, they are not likely to be over-
turned by any recount. Why delay the 
transition? Why run the risk that we 
won’t have a smooth, orderly, and effi-
cient passage from one administration 
to the other? Why, in the middle of a 
pandemic that has killed over 200,000 
Americans 
and 
will 
threaten 
over 
100,000 more before January 20, would 
we ever risk it over some bureaucratic 
delay? It is just unacceptable. 
The American people know the elec-
tion is over. Now it is time for us in 
Washington to concede that point. It is 
time for the Administrator of the GSA 
to do her job and announce the ascer-
tainment and move forward in an or-
derly, productive, and smooth transi-
tion.

RECOGNIZING THE WYOMING AS-
SOCIATION 
OF 
CONSERVATION 
DISTRICTS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize a significant 
anniversary for the Wyoming Associa-
tion of Conservation Districts. When 
they meet next week, the association 
will celebrate 75 years of service to Wy-
oming’s natural resources. Without 
question, the forests, streams, and soils 
in the state have seen immense benefit 
from the important work conservation 
district employees do every day. 
Conservation 
districts 
succeed 
through their work and partnerships 
with diverse stakeholders. Landowners, 
farmers 
and 
ranchers, 
government 
agencies, counties, towns, and other 
community organizations contribute to 
the conservation of land and water re-
sources on private and public lands in 
Wyoming. Local conservation district 
boards perform as a liaison between 
local landowners, resource users, and 
State and Federal governmental agen-
cies. The association helps individuals 
navigate programs and provides exem-
plary technical assistance to cultivate 
productive lands and healthy eco-
systems. Agriculture, industry, cities, 
forests, and wildlife all depend on 
strong and healthy watersheds. 
Wyoming has 34 conservation dis-
tricts in our 23 counties. Each district 
is run by staff and a board of five su-
pervisors, who serve voluntarily. Con-
servation districts direct programs pro-
tecting local renewable natural re-
sources at the local level. Each district

puts its focus on issues important to 
resource concerns in the county. These 
range from water quality monitoring 
and watershed planning to seedling 
tree sales and living snow fence pro-
grams, forest planning and rangeland 
management to wildlife habitat im-
provement 
and 
endangered 
species 
issues. 
I rely heavily on conservation dis-
tricts for their expertise in water, con-
servation, wildlife, forestry, and gen-
eral land management. As their mis-
sion statement says, in part, the Wyo-
ming Association of Conservation Dis-
tricts provides leadership for the con-
servation of Wyoming’s soil and water 
resources and promotes and protects 
the 
quality 
of 
Wyoming’s 
waters 
through responsible conservation ethic. 
People are the key to conservation 
district success, from local volunteers 
to dedicated staff and partners who 
dedicate themselves to the cause. The 
association provides valuable insight 
and expertise to countless projects and 
issues at the local, State, and national 
level. One of the best examples is in the 
recently retired, Bobbie Frank. 
Bobbie Frank served as executive di-
rector of the Wyoming Association of 
Conservation Districts for the last 29 
years. Bobbie’s list of achievements is 
long. From being intimately involved 
in a myriad of water quality issues 
both at the State and national levels to 
developing and implementing programs 
at the local level. Bobbie has received 
the Wyoming Stock Growers Guardian 
of the Grassland Award and the Kurt 
Bucholz Conservation Award. She has 
also been inducted as a member of the 
Wyoming Ag Hall of Fame. I look for-
ward to working with the Wyoming As-
sociation of Conservation District’s 
new executive director, Hunter Petsch, 
moving forward. 
It is without hesitation that I say 
Wyoming’s forests and plains would 
look much different today if the Wyo-
ming Association of Conservation Dis-
tricts had not unified in 1945. Each mu-
nicipal water manager, rancher, hiker, 
forester, hunter, and miner owes a debt 
of gratitude for the good work of the 
Wyoming Association of Conservation 
Districts. 
I would like to recognize several 
leaders within the Wyoming Associa-
tion of Conservation Districts for their 
dedicated service to the State of Wyo-
ming.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO BRIELLE PAQUETTE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Brielle Paquette 
of Salem as October’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. Brielle is using her creative 
talents as a videographer to help re-
move the stigma around mental illness 
and to help inspire her friends and 
neighbors to open up about their men-
tal health struggles. 
Brielle grew up in a family of photog-
raphers and filmmakers. From an early 
age, 
she 
found 
her 
passion 
in 
filmmaking. As she got older, Brielle 
recruited her young cousins to partici-
pate in music videos that she would di-
rect and film, all with the hope of put-
ting a smile on people’s faces. 
Brielle also grew up in a family with 
loved ones who experienced mental 
health 
challenges. 
Brielle’s 
father 
struggled with alcohol abuse, and her 
mother lives with anxiety. Brielle de-
veloped an anxiety disorder, which she 
did not talk about with anyone, that 
left her feeling isolated from her peers. 
When she entered high school, Brielle 
decided to use her talents with a video 
camera to help break down the stigma 
around mental illness. In 2019, Brielle 
submitted a PSA to a competition held 
by New Futures, a New Hampshire or-
ganization 
that 
seeks 
to 
promote 
health and wellness in the State. 
Brielle wanted to highlight the high 
rate of mental illness in young adults. 
To film the video, Brielle went to a 
crowded area in Boston with a sign 
that read ‘‘20–50 percent of adolescents 
struggle with mental illness. Hug to 
show support for people who are strug-
gling.’’ Brielle then tied a blindfold on 
herself and accepted hugs from strang-
ers as her mom filmed from afar. 
Brielle 
won 
the 
People’s 
Choice 
Award for that video and since then 
has 
filmed 
other 
PSAs 
aimed 
at 
destigmatizing mental illness and en-
couraging people to open up about 
their struggles. She also uses her plat-
form as Miss Londonderry to promote 
this important message. Additionally, 
as a member of her school’s women em-
powerment club, she is working on the 
early stages of a new PSA on body 
positivity. 
I am proud to recognize Brielle for 
her efforts to break down the barriers 
that too often prevent us from talking 
about mental illness. By using her tal-
ents to help facilitate conversations 
about a difficult issue and raising 
awareness 
around 
mental 
health, 
Brielle exemplifies what it means to be 
a Granite Stater. I look forward to see-
ing what she accomplishes next.∑

AND 
OFFICER 
NATALIE EUCCE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor Fayetteville Police 
Department Corporal Seay-Peter Floyd 
and Officer Natalie Eucce for being 
awarded the Attorney General’s Award 
for Distinguished Service in Policing 
by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
This is a well-deserved honor for 
their dedication, sacrifice, and bravery 
they demonstrated on December 7, 2019, 
when a gunman, armed with 100 rounds 
of ammunition, targeted law enforce-
ment. Tragically, Fayetteville Police 
Officer Stephen Carr was killed while 
sitting in a patrol vehicle in the police 
station’s parking lot. Corporal Floyd 
courageously pursued the suspect and

fired in order to stop the assailant. Of-
ficer Eucce joined in the pursuit and 
also fired her weapon. If not for their 
quick response, there could have been 
other victims. 
This prestigious award is given to 
State and local law enforcement offi-
cers who personify excellence while 
protecting others. Only 23 members of 
the law enforcement community from 
across the country earned this honor 
this year. Corporal Floyd and Officer 
Eucce are the first Arkansans to re-
ceive this award. 
Throughout their careers, Corporal 
Floyd and Officer Eucce have re-
sponded to calls for help while not 
knowing what challenges they will 
face. They are heroic public servants 
who courageously face danger head on. 
It takes a special person to put their 
life on the line every day to safeguard 
the public. Corporal Floyd and Officer 
Eucce represent the men and women 
who make a difference in our commu-
nities. I applaud their service and com-
mitment to safety and the rule of law 
and congratulate them for receiving 
the fourth annual Attorney General’s 
Award for Distinguished Service in Po-
licing.∑

OZARK MEDIA ARTS FESTIVAL 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to congratulate the Ozark 
Media Arts Festival on 10 years of suc-
cess and recognize the pathway it is 
creating from education to employ-
ment in the multimedia industry in Ar-
kansas and throughout the region. 
More than 8,000 students have par-
ticipated 
in 
OMAF, 
helping 
these 
young minds make connections with 
others who have similar passions in 
filmmaking, broadcast journalism, pro-
duction, photography, and other media 
platforms that keep citizens informed 
and entertained. The festival allows 
participants to explore their interests 
and learn from industry professionals 
on how to further develop their talents. 
OMAF provides a venue for students 
to showcase their abilities, learn new 
skills, and compete against the bright-
est up-and-comers in their field of in-
terest. The recognition that comes 
with earning the top spot in the com-
petitions hosted by the festival is cer-
tainly something to be proud of, and 
the enthusiasm shared amongst all par-
ticipants who put their creativity on 
display is what continues to make the 
Ozark Media Arts Festival a success 
and a place for students to foster rela-
tionships that will help them transi-
tion their skills from an educational 
setting to the communications indus-
try. 
The festival truly is investing in the 
future of the multimedia industry in 
the region. It is a good one-stop-shop 
for high schoolers to learn more about 
the programs offered at colleges and 
universities and other programs where 
they can continue to hone their skills. 
Just as importantly, it provides a valu-
able networking opportunity with po-
tential employers and demonstrates 
how they can turn their passion into a 
future career. 
It was a pleasure to participate in a 
virtual panel discussion for the 2020 
festival as educators, industry leaders, 
and policymakers and talk about the 
importance of communication and how 
technology continues to shape how we 
get information and stay connected 
with each other. 
Congratulations to Ozark Media Arts 
Festival on a decade of accomplish-
ments and encouraging multimedia 
education and building relationships to 
help future generations of communica-
tors realize their dream of a career in 
the multimedia industry.∑

RECOGNIZING THE JOHN WILLIAM 
JACKSON FUND 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I am 
pleased to recognize and honor the 20th 
Anniversary of the John William Jack-
son Fund and their contribution to the 
State of Idaho. 
Bill ‘‘Action’’ Jackson, of Boise, es-
tablished the John William Jackson 
Fund 20 years ago to honor his son, 
John, who died in a climbing accident 
in Central Asia. John William Jackson 
was known for his sense of adventure 
and passion for academic excellence, 
performing arts, and outdoor sports. He 
challenged himself and those around 
him to believe in themselves and take 
advantage of their full potential. 
The John William Jackson Fund sup-
ports Idaho youth through academic 
scholarships and grants for performing 
arts organizations, outdoor sporting 
experiences, and the purchase or rental 
of musical instruments. Just as John 
encouraged others to believe in them-
selves and reach for their dreams, the 
John William Jackson Fund provides 
the support and assistance needed to 
make these dreams a reality. Since 
2000, the fund has awarded more than 
300 grants and given over $1 million to 
Idaho’s youth. 
In addition to monetary donations, 
the Idaho Youth Education Recycling 
Partnership—(iYERP)—was established 
in 2007, creating a revenue stream for 
the Fund via metal recycling. This ini-
tiative seeks not only to fund scholar-
ships for Idaho’s youth, but also create 
a sustainable environment for these 
dreams to be met. 
Bill Jackson, the fund’s cofounder, 
will be recognized at an upcoming 
Idaho Philanthropy Day celebration. 
He will be honored as an outstanding 
partner in the community as an ‘‘Out-
standing Adult Philanthropist’’ on No-
vember 13, 2020. 
I am proud to recognize the John 
William Jackson Fund and their con-
tribution to the State of Idaho. Your 
great commitment to inspire Idaho’s 
youth and honor the memory of John is 
commendable.∑

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE VETERANS 
OF FOREIGN WARS POST 4639 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 75th Anniversary of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4639 in 
Williamsburg, Virginia. On November 16, 
1945, 72 Veterans returning from World War II 
founded Post 4639, and this Post has honor-
ably served the community ever since. 
Post 4639 is named in honor of Sergeant 
John Taylor Blacknall, Jr. and 1st Lieutenant 
Philip Sheridan Chess, Jr. who were both 
killed in action during World War II. Sergeant 
Blacknall, who was a soldier in the 116th 
Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division, was 
killed in action on June 6, 1944 at Basse- 
Normandie, France. 1st Lieutenant Chess was 
killed in action on July 17, 1944 at Villamagna, 
Volterra, Pisa, Toscana, Italy. I want to ex-
press my deepest gratitude to SGT Blacknall 
and 1LT Chess, and every American hero who 
has paid the ultimate price to service and pro-
tect our nation. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United 
States is comprised of veterans that served in 
combat zones during our nation’s wars who 
return to continue to serve our nation’s com-
munities. Post 4639 has been an All-American 
Veterans of Foreign Wars Post four times, and 
an All State Post eleven times. 
As the United States Representative for Vir-
ginia’s First District, I am honored to work with 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4639. I am 
particularly inspired by the dedication and hard 
work of Post 4639, and the commitment to 
their core values including, but not limited to: 
promoting patriotism, honoring military service, 
ensuring the care of Veterans and their fami-
lies, and serving their communities. The serv-
ice men and women at Post 4639 are true 
American heroes and serve as an example of 
what makes our nation special. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me to recognize the 75th Anniversary 
of The Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4639. 
I am deeply grateful for the men and women 
not only who serve at Post 4639, but who 
dedicate their life to service for our great na-
tion.

HONORING 
THE 
LEGACY 
OF 
LIFENET PARAMEDIC SHON MAT-
THEWS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and remember the legacy 
of Shon Matthews. A paramedic with the 
LifeNet Texarkana Division since October 
2007, Shon was a wonderful example of serv-
ice above self. 
Shon passed away on Monday, November 2 
after a battle with COVID–19. The Fourth Dis-
trict of Arkansas will grieve not only the loss 
of a friend, but also an exemplary public serv-
ant. For the past 23 years, Shon committed 
his life to working as a first responder, even 
volunteering for his local fire department in ad-
dition to working as an EMT and, eventually, 
a paramedic. 
Beyond his own service on LifeNet Air med-
ical helicopters, he sought to teach others 
those life-saving skills as Operations Manager 
for the Texarkana Division. Later becoming an 
area manager, Shon is said to have done 
‘‘whatever the company needed to take care 
of patients and to serve the community.’’ 
I first met Shon when he visited my office in 
2019 for the American Ambulance Associa-
tion’s Stars of Life event. He was dubbed 
‘‘The Selfie King’’ during that trip to Wash-
ington, and I am honored I had the chance to 
visit with him and learn more about his work 
in Arkansas. I take this time to honor Shon 
and his family for their selfless love of commu-
nity and their sacrifice for the safety and well- 
being of their fellow man.

IN HONOR OF DANIEL O’SULLIVAN 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Daniel O’Sullivan of 
Huntingdon County for his service in the 
United States Army. He is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-
ica. 
In Congress, it is my privilege—and my re-
sponsibility—to stand up for those who have 
served our country in uniform, as well as to 
recognize these brave Americans. As a nation, 
we are indebted to them. On behalf of the 
13th Congressional District, I thank Mr. 
O’Sullivan for his service to our nation and our 
community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALFRED 
LLEWELLYN HOBGOOD III 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Alfred Llewellyn Hobgood, III. 
Hobgood spent his entire life in North Caro-
lina. He was a successful businessman, a fix-
ture in the community and, above all, a loving 
husband and father of two. 
Alfred Hobgood was born on December 3, 
1946, in Kinston, North Carolina, to Alfred 
Llewellyn Hobgood, Jr., and Suefan Gooding 
Hobgood. 
He was raised in Smithfield and attended 
Darlington High School before attending the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His 
time at UNC was formative to his life and the 
lessons he learned set him up for a successful 
career in the business world. 
After leaving UNC, he began his career 
under the arms of Jim Wheat of Wheat First 
Securities. 
Then he went to Scott and Stringfellow in 
Eastern North Carolina. After that, he went on 
to work for RBC Wealth Management, where 
he served as Senior Vice President. 
Alfred was a passionate UNC fan and an 
active alumnus, serving as an officer on sev-
eral boards, including as president of the Co- 
Founders Club and chairman of the Excel-
lence Fund. 
Alfred was also an avid golfer. He was a 
founding board member of Old Chatham Golf 
Club and a board member of The Rex Hos-
pital Open. And he passionately supported the 
First Tee of the Triangle as a past Director. 
His weight as a member of the community 
was felt all over North Carolina as he sup-
ported the Parrot Academy of Kinston, the 
LMH Foundation, the University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill, St. Mary’s School in Ra-
leigh, Rex Hospital, and many other charitable 
causes. 
Sadly, Alfred Llewellyn Hobgood, III, passed 
away on October 6, 2019, at the age of 72. 
He will be greatly missed by his family, 
friends, and the entire community.

IN HONOR OF THE JED FOUNDA-
TION’S 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the 20th 
anniversary of the Jed Foundation and to 
commend the Foundation’s cofounders, Donna 
and Phillip Satow, for their unrelenting dedica-
tion to improving mental health among teens 
and young adults. 
The 
Jed 
Foundation, 
which 
is 
headquartered in my district, has become a 
national leader in the development of policies, 
programs, and systems to nurture mental and 
emotional health and prevent suicide among 
teens and young adults. In the past 20 years, 
The Jed Foundation has provided programs 
and resources that have helped more than 
3,000 high schools, colleges and universities 
across the country strengthen their mental 
health safety nets. 
After the tragic loss of their son Jed, Donna 
and Phillip Satow established the Jed Founda-
tion to better equip all teens and young adults 
to navigate mental health challenges, success-
fully enter adulthood, and meet their full poten-
tial. The Satows recognized the need for a 
uniform model for suicide prevention on col-
lege and university campuses, and they un-
derstood the importance of addressing the 
stigma and secrecy associated with mental 
health in these communities. 
With this vision in mind, the Jed Foundation 
created JED Campus, a program that imple-
ments a comprehensive approach to mental 
health and substance abuse. In the past two 
decades JED Campus has been utilized by 
over 300 colleges, representing nearly 3.7 mil-
lion students, across the nation. Additionally, 
the Jed Foundation has partnered with over 
1,600 colleges and universities to utilize the 
foundation’s ULifeline.org on line resource 
center, which provides students with informa-
tion about mental health and how to seek help 
if they are struggling. 
From ensuring that mental health resources 
are culturally responsive for Latinx teens, 
young adults, and their families, to conducting 
in-depth research on how communities can ef-
fectively understand and support the mental 
health of LBGTQ+ teens and young adults, 
the Jed Foundation has gone above and be-
yond to address the mental health needs of di-
verse communities. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize the Jed Foun-
dation for its outstanding public service, and I 
laud Donna and Phillip Satow’s continued 
commitment to promoting the well-being of 
students, families, and schools. They have im-
proved the lives and mental health outcomes 
of millions of students in their twenty years of 
service, and I wish them the best as they con-
tinue their lifesaving work. 
IN HONOR OF DONALD MILLER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Donald Miller of Hun-
tingdon County for his service in the United 
States Army. He is an outstanding Pennsylva-
nian, and I am grateful for his service to our 
nation, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
and our community.

cans’ freedom and our values. They answered

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF THADDEUS W. GAY, SR. 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Thaddeus W. 
Gay, Sr., a true American hero and inspiration 
to many throughout North Carolina’s Eighth 
Congressional District. 
Mr. Gay was born on June 27, 1922 and 
after graduating from West Southern Pines 
‘‘Rosenwald’’ School, he attended North Caro-
lina A&T State University before enlisting in 
the U.S. Army during the height of World War 
II. A decorated military servant, Mr. Gay 
served our great nation in New Guinea and 
the South Pacific and received the Asiatic Pa-
cific Service Medal with a bronze service star, 
Good Conduct Medal, and World War II Vic-
tory Medal. 
Mr. Gay represents the best our nation has 
to offer and served with honor and distinction 
until 1944. Following the war, he found suc-
cess running various small businesses and 
even sought patents for several of his inven-
tions. Mr. Gay’s service to our community ex-
tended far beyond his military service and en-
trepreneurial success. He was a tireless advo-
cate on behalf of the West Southern Pines 
Civic Club, the Rufus L. McLaughlin American 
Legion Post No. 177, the Southern Pines Land 
and Housing Trust, and the NAACP. 
Mr. Gay passed away on October 20, 2020 
and left behind a legacy of extraordinary ac-
complishment. My thoughts and prayers are 
with his family and all who knew and loved 
him. Mr. Gay will live on in the hearts and 
minds of all who felt his kindness and I join 
the entire community in honoring his extraor-
dinary life. 
Madam SPEAKER, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Thaddeus W. 
Gay, Sr.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANCES 
STAGG NICHOLSON SANDERS 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of 
Frances Stagg Nicholson Sanders. 
Madam Speaker, Frances Stagg was born 
on December 10, 1929, to Sterling Johnston 
Nicholson and Mary Washington Stagg. She 
was the youngest of five siblings and grew up 
in Durham, North Carolina. Shortly after at-
tending Duke University, Mrs. Stagg married 
her childhood sweetheart, Bill Sanders. 
Frances Stagg was a beloved pillar of her 
community. She joined the Raleigh Junior 
League in 1955, was a member of the first 
Docent class of the North Carolina Museum of 
Art, President of Rex Hospital Guild Board and 
served as the Chair of the Wake Committee of 
the North Carolina Society of Colonial Dames, 
an organization devoted to historic preserva-
tion and patriotic services. She was also chair 
of the Girls Committee and honorary chair for 
the North Carolina Terpsichorean Club Debu-
tante Ball. Stagg’s greatest joy was spending 
time with family and friends at her home in 
Morehead City. Always with a smile, Stagg 
had a full and vibrant life filled with love and 
laughter. She enjoyed the salt air and sun-
shine, and loved boating on the Harem with 
Bill and their girls. She always loved having 
her dogs nearby as well as her many wonder-
ful friends. 
Sadly, Frances Stagg Nicholson Sanders 
passed away peacefully in her sleep on Au-

be greatly missed by her friends, family, and 
her entire community.

IN HONOR OF ROBERT GRISWOLD 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Robert Griswold of 
Huntingdon County for his service in the 
United States Navy. He is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community.

RECOGNIZING EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR JOSE CAMACHO 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and service of Mr. Jose 
Camacho, who has retired after serving 37 
years as the Executive Director of the Texas 
Association of Community Health Centers 
(TACHC). 
Armed with his unwavering commitment to 
improving the lives of those less fortunate, Mr. 
Camacho earned his law degree from the Uni-
versity of Texas in 1973 and worked in private 
practice until 1979 when he became the Direc-
tor of the Farmworker Policy Impact Project at 
Texas Rural Legal Aid in Austin. In 1982 Mr. 
Camacho became the General Counsel for the 
National Migrant Referral Project and in 1983, 
he began his career with TACHC as General 
Counsel where he assisted in the develop-
ment of the organization. Mr. Camacho be-
came the Executive Director of the Texas As-
sociation of Community Health Centers in 
1984 and served in that capacity until his re-
tirement in 2020. Mr. Camacho’s career was 
devoted to the development of grassroot, com-
munity-controlled organizations in low-income 
communities whose purpose is to provide 
comprehensive health care services to medi-
cally indigent residents. Mr. Camacho’s north 
star has been the Federally Qualified Health 
Care Program which affords low income com-
munities the opportunity to mobilize residents 
around the need for culturally appropriate 
health care services and develop a system of 
health care that is responsive to local resi-
dents. 
TACHC is the federally designated primary 
care association for the state and is the link 
between federal, state, and local entities pro-
viding health care for Texas’ most vulnerable 
populations. TACHC started with a member-
ship of seven (7) community clinics in 1983 
serving approximately 7,500 patients annually. 
While the organization had a humble begin-
ning, Mr. Camacho’s forward-thinking and 
leadership helped grow it into the reliable and 
successful organization that exists today. Dur-
ing Mr. Camacho’s tenure, TACHC exceeded 
expectations and extended service to over 100 
organizations within Texas. As the largest net-
work of primary care clinics in Texas, TACHC- 
member clinics have over 550 delivery sites, 
throughout Texas providing health care to over 
1.6 million patients annually; approximately 80 
percent are patients with incomes below pov-
erty. Heavily involved with the Texas State 
Legislature, the United States Congress, local 
community action groups and the American 
Health Lawyers Association, he initiated nu-
merous legislative proposals which improved 
how health services were provided in Texas. 
Additionally, he initiated cost-saving contracts 
which helped save money for community 
health centers and allowed them to increase 
and expand valuable services to patients. 
Health centers serve communities suffering 
from shortages of primary medical, dental, or 
mental health providers. Their mission is to 
serve low-income and uninsured individuals 
who lack access to quality and affordable 
healthcare. With Texas continuously leading 
the nation in the number of uninsured, now 
estimated to be well over 5 million in 2019, 
Mr. Camacho made it his mission to advocate 
to the state and federal government to 
strengthen and preserve the health care safety 
net and assisted in the development of health 
centers in medically underserved communities. 
He negotiated and reviewed legal documents, 
conducted policy analysis, and drafted legisla-
tive proposals on behalf of TACHC and the 
community health centers the association 
serves. In additional to his role of General 
Counsel to TACHC’s Board of Directors and 
members, Mr. Camacho provided steadfast 
support directly to Texas Health Centers, 
keeping them informed, designing and imple-
menting training programs related to regu-
latory requirements, legislative changes, in-
dustry trends and available opportunities—all 
with the focus on expanding access to care 
and enhancing both the quality and scope of 
services provided to vulnerable populations 
across Texas. 
Needless to say, Mr. Camacho has had a 
tremendous impact on health services in 
Texas, and his work will not be forgotten. His 
commitment to and vision for TACHC laid the 
foundation for its future success and set an 
example 
for 
community 
health 
centers 
throughout Texas. He cares deeply about the 
people he served and consistently showed 
what it meant to be a good leader. He guid-
ed—he motivated—he inspired. The dedica-
tion that he exhibited should be a constant re-
minder of how we should live our daily lives. 
This recognition is to commemorate Mr. 
Camacho for his loyalty and devotion to oth-
ers, and for ensuring the best quality of health 
care for all Texans, especially those with lim-
ited resources. 
As we move forward, let us take the time to 
also appreciate the service of heroes among 
our community like Mr. Camacho—all those 
individuals who spend their lives committed to 
service and ensuring health and safety of oth-
ers. In the words of President John F. Ken-
nedy, ‘‘As we express our gratitude, we must 
never forget that the highest appreciation is 
not to utter words, but to live by them.’’ And 
so, we take time today to express our grati-
tude for Mr. Camacho’s work. His impact on 
the health status of Texans has been incred-
ible. The example he set in his career serves 
as the model of commitment and dedicated 
service that many of his former colleagues 
now live by. We are so grateful for Mr. 
Camacho and his life’s work. His legacy of 
service to the less fortunate is truly remark-
able. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the career and service of Jose 
Camacho.

IN HONOR OF CLAIR GREENE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

tingdon County for his service in the United 
States Army. Clair is an outstanding Pennsyl-
vania, and I am grateful for his service to our 
nation, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanian, 
and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-

NATIONAL NURSE 
PRACTITIONER’S WEEK 2020 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National Nurse Practi-
tioner’s Week. 
All over our nation, nurse practitioners serve 
as trusted health care providers for patients. 
They work tirelessly to diagnose and treat pa-
tients with COVID–19 and to combat commu-
nity spread nationwide, while grieving their col-
leagues who have lost their lives during the 
pandemic. 
Nurse Practitioners work to expand access 
to care in underserved communities, and end 
health disparities in health care. They provide 
high-quality primary, acute and specialty care 
services while focusing on health promotion, 
disease prevention, health education and 
counseling, guiding patients to make smarter 
health and lifestyle choices every day. They 
are highly skilled practitioners with advanced 
education and clinical training, building upon 
their initial registered nurse preparation. The 
confidence that patients have in Nurse Practi-
tioner-delivered health care is evidenced by 
the more than one billion visits made annually 
to Nurse Practitioners across the country.

IN HONOR OF WILLIAM B. MARTIN 
HON. JOHN JOYCE

Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
JAVIER ESTADES AND HIS SERV-
ICE TO THE CIGAR ASSOCIATION 
OF AMERICA 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Javier Estades. 
Javier was born in Spain, but went on to re-
ceive his undergraduate degree from George 
Washington University right here in Wash-
ington—his first real formal contact with the 
U.S. 
Javier then went back to Europe where he 
went on to receive his MBA and start his ca-
reer working for large, fast-moving consumer 
companies. Then, about 15 years ago, he was 
hired by Altadis to manage the mass market 
team in Spain. As he progressed through the 
company, he was eventually hired to run the 
Altadis team right here in the United States 
and he immigrated here nearly 10 years ago. 
Javier Estades now serves as the president 
and chief executive officer of Tabacalera USA, 
which oversees Imperial Brands’ premium 
cigar businesses, including Altadis U.S.A., JR 
Cigar and Casa de Montecristo. 
And for the past five years, Javier has head-
ed the Cigar Association of America—a na-
tional trade association representing cigar 
manufacturers, importers, and distributors, as 
well as other major suppliers of the industry. 
The CAA is proactive in defending its mem-
bers, their businesses and other like-minded 
associations. It also has an extensive network 
established to monitor and act on federal, 
state and local regulations that could have an 
impact on its members and the cigar industry 
at large. The organization’s bylaws have been 
amended several times to allow for Javier 
Estades to serve multiple terms as the organi-
zation’s chairman—something which I think 
speaks directly to his unwavering leadership to 
build deep relationships and be an effective 
advocate for his industry. 
Javier is deeply knowledgeable of every as-
pect of his industry and is so well-versed he 
can go toe-to-toe with just about anyone on 
any issue. 
His time as Chairman of the Cigar Associa-
tion of America was marked by an almost 
overwhelming number of challenges, yet 
Javier seemed to navigate them all with ease, 
simply because of the type of person he is. 
It has been a real honor and joy to get to 
know Javier over the last five years and I 
hope he enjoys his retirement from heading 
the CAA—maybe even with a cigar.

IN HONOR OF LILLIAN JENNINGS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Huntingdon County for her service in the 
United States Navy. She is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for her serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our

TRIBUTE TO TOM KARLO 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of my fellow members of the San 
Diego Congressional Delegation, I would like 
to pay tribute to Tom Karlo, the General Man-
ager of KPBS in San Diego. 
After 47 years with the station, Tom is retir-
ing. These days, very few of us can say we 
have been with the same organization for 
nearly 50 years. But when you have, as Tom 
says, the best job in the world, it’s not sur-
prising. 
While Tom has been a fixture at KPBS, 
KPBS is a longtime respected fixture when it 
comes to news in San Diego. And Tom de-
serves credit for that. 
We in San Diego are very proud of KPBS, 
and it is no surprise that it is the highest-rated 
public television station in America. Every 
week, more than 1.2 million people tune in on 
television or radio or click or stream KPBS 
content. 
During Tom’s tenure, KPBS’s top-notch jour-
nalists, producers, and crew have won numer-
ous awards both locally and regionally, as well 
as nationally. I know my colleagues can attest 
along with me that when you are interviewed 
by KPBS you had better be prepared because 
they certainly would be. 
Tom himself has won three local Emmy 
awards. 
When I joined KPBS as a community pro-
ducer in the late ’70s, Tom had already been 
there a few years. As a student at San Diego 
State University studying film and television, 
he was hired as a part-time assistant in 1973. 
We worked together during several years of 
public television auctions (some of us remem-
ber those days) and he was truly a man of 
many disciplines. 
He has done just about every job—director, 
producer, assistance cameraman. In 2009, he 
was elevated to General Manager and we find 
ourselves working together again as he would 
come to Washington, D.C., for what was a 
common goal for all of us: protecting vital fed-
eral funding for public broadcasting. 
Over the years, while his roles have 
changed, one constant has been Tom’s self- 
effacing manner. 
His retirement will be our loss, but it will be 
his family’s gain. He is no doubt looking for-
ward to spending more time with them, espe-
cially his grandchildren. 
My colleagues, Reps. SCOTT PETERS, JUAN 
VARGAS, and MIKE LEVIN, and I would like to 
wish Tom all the best in his retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF BOBBY 
MARTIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Bobby Mar-
tin, who passed away on November 4, 2020. 
Bobby was born on February 13, 1933 to Eli-
jah and Valca Martin. As a 1956 agronomy 
graduate 
of 
Mississippi 
State 
University, 
Bobby was a lifelong Bulldog fan. He served 
as the Chairman of the MSU Foundation, the 
President of the Bulldog Club, and the Alumni 
Association’s 1999 National Alumnus of the 
Year. In 2002, he was awarded the honorary 
doctorate of business degree. Bobby served 
northeast Mississippi as Chairman of the Blue 
Mountain College Board of Trustees and as a 
member of the Board of Trustees for North-
east Mississippi Community College. 
Outside of serving his community, Bobby 
also served in the United States Army during 
the Korean War, then later began his career at 
The Peoples Bank. He held the positions of 
president and CEO for 42 years, roles now oc-
cupied by his daughter. Bobby’s passion for 
his community was evidenced by his lifetime 
of service to his customers and his mentorship 
of countless students and employees. He 
served as Chairman of the Mississippi Bank-
ers Association and the Mississippi Board of 
Banking Review. His generosity was em-
bodied in his position as chairman emeritus of 
the CREATE Foundation. He spearheaded the 
effort to establish a CREATE affiliate in Tippah 
County in 1997, an organization dedicated to 
improving the quality of life in communities 
through investments. 
Bobby was known as a pillar of faith in his 
community. He served as a deacon and mem-
ber of the choir of First Baptist Church. He 
treated his associates like family. The Peo-
ple’s Bank, as well as the countless organiza-
tions and local industries he impacted, mourn 
his loss and will always remember his pro-
found impact on the community. 
He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Bar-
bara Cook; his daughter, Mary Childs; and 
many beloved grandchildren. Bobby was pre-
ceded in death by his parents and sisters 
Georgia Crook, Virginia Coombs, and Peggy 
Marvin. 
Bobby Martin lived as an example of gen-
erosity, faith, and service to his community 
and country. His impact on North Mississippi 
will endure, and he will be greatly missed. 
HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
MAR-
GARET 
ANGELL 
SHIELDS 
VOLNEY 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 9, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of Mar-
garet Angell Shields Volney. 
Madam Speaker, Margaret Angell Shields 
Volney was a proud graduate of East Carolina 
Teachers College where she received her BS 
degree in Home Economics. Her education 
gave her the foundation for a life filled with 
creativity and gourmet meals as she became 
a party planner extraordinaire with a driven 
desire to learn and explore new things. 
Margaret was an active member of St. Paul 
Catholic Church, where she volunteered her 
decorating talents for various church and 
school fundraising events. And she was a pas-
sionate member of The Old Saint Paul Preser-
vation Guild, working towards preserving our 
oldest Catholic Church in North Carolina—a 
place where all of her family members had 
been baptized, married, and buried. 
Madam Speaker, Margaret actively pursued 
the preservation of the Judge Gaston House, 
where the first recorded NC Catholic Mass 
was held in 1821. In 1959, on Tryon Palace’s 
opening day, Margaret was among the first 
docents under the guidance of Miss Gertrude 
Carraway. Margaret was an active Scout lead-
er for many years; a founding member of the 
Trent Woods Garden Club; a Master Gar-
dener; a member New Bern Golf & Country 
Club; and Trent River Artist Association. In 
1978, Margaret and her daughter opened ‘Bal-
loons Galore,’ an ever-evolving place to shop 
especially during the holiday seasons. Wheth-
er it was a special decorating event, or a bou-
quet of balloons delivered by ’Big Bird,’ Mar-
garet brought smiles and memories for over 
32 successful years in business. 
Sadly, Margaret Angell Shields Volney died 
peacefully surrounded by family and friends 
earlier this year on January 15, 2020. She 
was 93 years old.
