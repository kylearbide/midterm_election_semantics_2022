PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Be gracious to these, our lawmakers, 
O God. Shower Your mercy on them as 
they continue to take on the chal-
lenges of their office. 
Schedules press on them; obligations 
pursue them all the day long. No one 
more than You knows the pace they 
keep, the long days and restless nights, 
the unrelenting schedule they juggle to 
master, and the countless and circui-
tous flights home to their districts. 
In You may they find their respite. 
Keep their feet from falling, that they 
may walk before You in the light You 
shine on their lives. 
In You may they place their trust. 
Keep their consciences clear and their 
motives pure as You guide their deci-
sions. 
In You may they be assured that 
their worries and concerns are known. 
Keep them in Your care, that nothing 
can snatch them from Your hand. 
To You, then, may they turn, con-
fident of Your deliverance and sure in 
the stamina You provide. To You may 
they offer their praise, and to Your 
Word may they turn. 
In Your saving name we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF CODY 
LYSTER 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the life of 
Cody Lyster, son of Kevin and Lea Ann 
Lyster, of Aurora, Colorado. 
Cody passed away on April 8, 2020, 
and is Colorado’s second youngest vic-
tim to die from COVID–19. He was a 
criminal justice major at Colorado 
Mesa University, following in his fa-
ther’s footsteps to become a law en-
forcement officer. 
Cody was an avid baseball player. As 
a freshman, Cody was named team cap-
tain of his school’s club baseball team, 
a first for Colorado Mesa University 
history. He helped others through his 
love for the game and had a knack for 
bringing people together and could be 
counted on during times of calm and 
times of crisis. 
Cody made his community better. In 
his honor, a $1 million scholarship was 
established at Colorado Mesa Univer-
sity, and a sportsmanship award and 
scholarship at Arapahoe Little League 
were dedicated to a life well-lived. 
Cody was an inspiration to others, 
and I can think of few as deserving of 
this honor today. I honor Cody and 
thank the Lysters for drawing strength 
from tragedy to make sure Cody’s 
story is heard and to save as many 
lives as they can during this pandemic. 
f 
CONGRATULATING 
DRIPPING 
SPRINGS FOR TAKING 5A SOC-
CER STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the Dripping Springs Tigers women’s 
soccer team for their outstanding win 
in the UIL Class 5A final. 
Dripping Springs finished the season 
as the Class 5A State Champion with a 
record 26 wins. They outscored their 
opponents this season 104–8. 
The team showcased their amazing 
talent and skills on the field, and I am 
proud that all of their hard work and 
dedication throughout the year ulti-
mately paid off. 
Congratulations again to the Drip-
ping Springs Tigers. Texas’ 25th Con-
gressional District is extraordinarily 
proud of their achievement, and we 
cannot wait to see what they will do 
next. Go Tigers. 
In God We Trust.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2002 
April 21, 2021 
MUSLIM TRAVEL BAN 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, the Muslim ban 
enacted under the previous administra-
tion is a stain on our country and our 
Nation’s history. As we work to rebuild 
a humane and just immigration sys-
tem, we must start by outlawing any 
type of this State-sanctioned religious 
bigotry. We do that today by passing 
the NO BAN Act. 
This bill strengthens the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act by banning 
discrimination on the basis of religion. 
Importantly, it will prevent any future 
President from enacting something 
like the Muslim ban in the future by 
placing appropriate checks and bal-
ances on the President’s authority in 
this area. 
Discrimination based on religion is 
not who we are as a nation. Today, we 
can take the first step towards a more 
just and humane immigration system, 
and I urge all my colleagues to join me 
in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the NO BAN Act. 
f 
HONORING J. MICHAEL MYER 
(Mr. MCKINLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of my 
friend, Mike Myer of Wheeling, who 
passed away earlier this year. 
Besides being a loving husband and 
father, Mike was an incredibly gifted 
editor at the Ogden newspaper chain 
and was a personal friend. Over the 
years, Mike and I had lively discus-
sions on politics, the fossil fuel indus-
try, and what would make West Vir-
ginia better. He was both a pragmatic 
and authentic editor, and he cared 
deeply for the livelihoods of men and 
women in the coal and natural gas 
fields of our valley. 
Out of frustration, Mike would re-
peatedly ask why Members of Congress 
would intentionally inflict harm on so 
many of these families. His passion was 
his community and the people who 
lived there. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
his wife, Connie, and their two children 
and two grandchildren as we all mourn 
Mike’s passing. 
Mike, you made a difference. You are 
already missed. 
f 
TRI-CAUCUS RESOLUTION ON 
COVID–19 VACCINE EQUITY 
(Ms. CHU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, as chair of 
the Congressional Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Caucus, I rise today to join my 
colleagues in the Tri-Caucus to ensure 
equitable access to the COVID–19 vac-
cine for communities of color. 
While we are all equally susceptible 
to the coronavirus, we are not all 
equally impacted by it. Communities 
of color are disproportionately likely 
to be in frontline jobs with greater ex-
posure to the virus; have less access to 
quality healthcare; and, as a result, 
have been experiencing higher infec-
tion and mortality rates throughout 
the pandemic. 
With over 150 deaths per 100,000 cases, 
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders 
have one of the highest mortality 
groups of all groups from this virus. 
That is why we will be introducing a 
resolution to address this. If we rely on 
communities of color to get us through 
this pandemic, then we need to ensure 
they are provided equitable access to 
the vaccine so they can stay healthy. 
We must ensure all Americans have an 
equal shot to be vaccinated. 
f 
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 
GOES TO CONGRESSMAN BOBBY 
SCOTT 
(Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate my good 
friend, Congressman BOBBY SCOTT, on 
receiving the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the L. Douglas Wilder 
School of Government and Public Af-
fairs at Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity on April 15, 2021. 
The Lifetime Achievement Award 
recognizes 
an 
individual 
Virginian 
whose career represents the highest 
values of public service and citizenship, 
and who has made a substantial con-
tribution to the good of the Common-
wealth. 
Congressman BOBBY SCOTT is incred-
ibly deserving of this recognition and 
award. He has spent more than four 
decades in public service, serving in 
the Virginia General Assembly for 15 
years prior to being elected, and now 
serving Virginia’s Third District in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, where 
he has been since 1992. 
It is my honor to serve the Common-
wealth of Virginia with a servant lead-
er like BOBBY
SCOTT. We share the 
same desire to work tirelessly for Vir-
ginians and to advocate for the needs 
of the Commonwealth. 
Please join me in congratulating 
BOBBY SCOTT on receiving the Lifetime 
Achievement Award and in thanking 
him for his dedicated service on behalf 
of all Virginians.

PROMOTING COVID–19 VACCINE EQ-
UITY AMONG COMMUNITIES OF 
COLOR 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a resolution pro-
moting 
COVID–19 
vaccine 
equity 
among communities of color. 
Communities of color continue to be 
disproportionately impacted by the on-
going COVID–19 crisis, highlighting 
longstanding health, social, and eco-
nomic inequities. 
The 
resolution 
calls 
for 
the 
prioritization of areas with a high So-
cial 
Vulnerability 
Index, 
SVI, 
for 
COVID–19 
vaccination 
efforts 
and 
working with trusted community part-
ners to implement culturally and lin-
guistically 
appropriate 
strategies, 
among other efforts. 
The resolution is going to be intro-
duced during this month of April, dur-
ing 
the 
National 
Minority 
Health 
Month to promote the health and well- 
being of racial and ethnic minority 
communities and to underscore the 
need for these communities to get vac-
cinated. 
Vaccinate, vacunen. It is very impor-
tant that they get vaccinated, es muy 
importante que se vacunen. 
Madam Speaker, vaccinate yourself. 
It is very important. 
I am so proud to support this resolu-
tion.

106TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of the 106th 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide. 
From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Em-
pire engaged in the systematic and or-
ganized murder and deportation of an 
estimated 1.5 million Armenians. 
Around the world, leaders have right-
ly identified these horrific events as 
genocide. However, despite both the 
House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate passing resolutions in 2019 recog-
nizing this tragedy, no United States 
President has ever joined in this ac-
knowledgement. 
This week, I and my colleagues in the 
Congressional Caucus on Armenian 
Issues sent a letter to President Biden 
urging him to formally recognize the 
Armenian genocide. 
Many of the men, women, and chil-
dren forced to flee Armenia immi-
grated to the United States and have 
raised their families and embraced 
their new communities in our country. 
They deserve our recognition. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring and remembering those whose 
lives were lost and forever changed by 
the Armenian genocide.

AFGHANISTAN TROOP

(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was

ghanistan.

again wage failed forever wars. This is 
also a critical moment to show we can 
defend America and protect the global 
commons without a $740 billion defense 
budget. 
We must repeal the Authorization for 
the Use of Military Force; reassert con-
gressional oversight of war powers; and 
cut the Pentagon’s budget by at least 
10 percent as we invest instead in diplo-
macy, humanitarian assistance, and 
solving global challenges like climate 
change and pandemic preparedness. 
The war in Afghanistan cost our 
country more than $2 trillion, the lives 
of 2,400 American servicemembers, and 
credibility at home and abroad. The 
generation that fought in this war 
must now govern in light of its mis-
takes. Let us resolve to learn from 
them.

RECOGNIZING GOLD STAR 
SPOUSES DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in rec-
ognition of Gold Star Spouses Day. 
Earlier this month, we honored the 
spouses who lost a loved one in service 
and remember their sacrifices. 
As the son of a Navy veteran and the 
proud father of an Army soldier, I rec-
ognize the challenges our military fam-
ilies face. It is important to remember 
that our freedom is not free. Gold Star 
Spouses Day reminds us of the cost of 
war. Each year on April 5, it is impor-
tant to take the time to remember, re-
spect, and honor the spouses and their 
families of our fallen servicemembers. 
Madam Speaker, Gold Star spouses 
and their families deserve our grati-
tude today and every day. God bless 
the brave men and women who put 
their lives on the line to protect us and 
God bless their families.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL DAN HELIX 
(Mr. DESAULNIER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life of Major Gen-
eral Dan Helix. 
Dan grew up in West Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, and enjoyed a distinguished 41- 
year career with the United States 
Army and Army Reserve. 
On top of his service in the military, 
he served on the Concord City Council 
for 8 years before serving as a director 
of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District. 
After being away for some time, Dan 
eventually returned to the city council 
and served two terms as mayor during 
both of his tenures. 
In 1989, Dan retired from the U.S. 
Army as a major general. As a Korean 
war veteran, Dan earned numerous rec-
ommendations including: the Army 
Distinguished Service Medal, the Sil-
ver Star, the Legion of Merit, the 
Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ device, and the 
Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. 
Sadly, Dan passed away last month 
at the age of 91. He was a cherished 
resident of Concord who dedicated his 
life to helping others. He was a mentor 
to me and to many others. 
Please join me in honoring Major 
General Dan Helix for his many con-
tributions to my community and to 
this country.

COMMEMORATING 46TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF BLACK APRIL 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to commemorate the 46th anni-
versary of Black April. 
April 30, 1975, marked the fall of Sai-
gon and the end of the Vietnam war. 
Many Vietnamese Americans who were 
alive during the war remember this as 
the day that signified the loss of a 
country they once called home. 
The people left everything they knew 
to flee communism. Hundreds of thou-
sands of Vietnamese people have reset-
tled in the United States and built vi-
brant communities here. California’s 
48th District is the proud home of Lit-
tle Saigon, which is home to more Vi-
etnamese Americans than anywhere 
else in the United States. 
On Black April, I will join the Viet-
namese Americans in our community 
and around the country in honoring 
those who served in Vietnam, and 
those who lost their lives attempting 
to flee Communist rule.

TRI-CAUCUS COVID–19 VACCINE 
EQUITY RESOLUTION 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, as a proud member of the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I rise 
in strong support of the Tri-Caucus res-
olution promoting COVID–19 vaccine 
equity among communities of color. 
I represent the large immigrant pop-
ulation that has been especially hard 
hit by this crisis, and now these are the 
same communities who are still strug-
gling to get the vaccine. 
Yes, vaccine hesitancy remains an 
issue, but the reality is that access is 
an even bigger problem. If we are seri-
ous about fighting COVID–19, we need 
to meet people where they are and 
bring vaccines to those who need it 
most, and we can’t do this without en-
gaging with trusted community lead-
ers. 
I want to take this opportunity to ac-
knowledge one of these leaders in Chi-
cago. Illinois Unidos, a coalition of 
health professionals and community 
leaders, is one of a kind and stands as 
a national model. From testing, to the 
vaccine rollout, to housing and food as-
sistance, Illinois Unidos has stood 
shoulder to shoulder with the Latino 
community in Chicago. 
f 
GREEN NEW DEAL 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, there is 
no denying that we need to support an 
all-of-the-above solution for energy 
policy to secure our energy independ-
ence. But the Green New Deal which 
was recently introduced, yet again, 
seeks to fundamentally change our way 
of life, cripple American businesses, 
and explode our national debt—$93 tril-
lion, with a T, which is how much their 
proposal will cost over the next 10 
years. 
Let’s put that into perspective. $93 
trillion is more money than the Fed-
eral Government has spent for the en-
tire period from 1979 until the present. 
Madam Speaker, that is absurd. Worse 
yet, how do the Democrats propose 
that we pay for it? By raising the 
taxes, of course, up to 70 percent. This 
is outrageous. 
It crushes jobs, costs an average 
American household nearly $700,000 
through 2029, provides paychecks for 
people unwilling to work, abolishes air-
planes, cows, and fossil fuels, and 
would require rebuilding and retro-
fitting every building in America. This 
is a crazy policy. 
f 
ENCOURAGING COSPONSORSHIP OF 
TRI-CAUCUS COVID–19 VACCINA-
TION EQUITY 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage cosponsorship of 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus-led 
Tri-Caucus COVID–19 Vaccination Eq-
uity resolution. 
Hispanic, Black, Asian American, Na-
tive Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and 
Native American communities con-
tinue to bear the brunt of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Not only are communities of color 
suffering 
disproportionately 
from 
COVID–19 complications, but they are 
receiving vaccines at a lower rate than 
their White counterparts. These inequi-
ties are not new. They highlight long-
standing health, economic, and social 
disparities. 
As chair of the Congressional His-
panic Caucus, I worked with my Tri- 
Caucus colleagues to introduce this 
resolution, 
promoting 
equity 
in 
COVID–19 vaccinations. The resolution 
calls for solutions like prioritizing vac-
cines to communities with the highest 
rates of infections and deaths, working

INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise for the concerns over the Presi-
dent’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan. 
One concern is the steep price tag, but 
my bigger concern is what the adminis-
tration is trying to classify as infra-
structure. 
We are to the point of changing the 
definition of what that is. We are 
throwing everything in except the 
kitchen sink and the kitchen table and 
calling it infrastructure. I think that is 
irrational and I think that is irrespon-
sible. 
How can you call this an infrastruc-
ture bill when less than 6 percent of it 
goes to roads and bridges, 5 percent 
goes to broadband infrastructure, and 
less than 2 percent goes to the water-
ways, locks, dams, ports, and airports? 
Less than 2 percent of our waterways 
and ports is unacceptable. This type of 
infrastructure is critical for Hoosiers 
in transporting our manufactured and 
agriculture exports to the global mar-
ket. 
If we are going to ask the American 
taxpayers to make these critical and 
substantial investments, it is our duty 
to make sure our dollars are spent 
wisely and efficiently on true infra-
structure. 
f 
GREEN NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to call for a 
Green New Deal for America. 
As one of the youngest members of 
this body, I am proud to represent a 
generation that is taking on climate 
change with the urgency that it de-
serves. 
The Green New Deal is a call to ac-
tion 
and 
a 
blueprint 
for 
positive 
change. It is about choosing justice and 
progress over scarcity and inequality. 
It is about choosing to have a plan in-
stead of waiting for a miracle. 
San Diegans are all too familiar with 
how devastating unchecked climate 
change has been for our community, 
and those who can least afford it have 
paid the highest price. 
This plan is to mobilize and rebuild 
our economy around clean energy, em-
powered workers, and good jobs. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
generation 
knows that we can’t take small steps 
to solve big problems. We have to think 
differently and reimagine a better fu-
ture. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO GERALD 
CLARK 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to my good 
friend, Gerald Clark, a true American 
hero from my district who passed away 
on April 19. 
Gerald dedicated his life to helping 
his fellow veterans and their families 
and patriotically served his country 
during World War II. 
Gerald viewed his time with the U.S. 
Army as an adventure. He fought with 
the 75th Infantry Division at the Battle 
of the Bulge and lost his leg defending 
our country fighting the Nazis. 
He was awarded a Purple Heart for 
his service and sacrifice. He was honor-
ably discharged after being hospital-
ized over a year. Then he returned to 
Tennessee; 
married 
his 
wife, 
Bea; 
raised five children; and continued to 
serve his community. 
For decades, Gerald held member-
ships 
in 
the 
American 
Legion, 
AMVETS, 
Disabled 
American 
Vet-
erans, Military Order of the Purple 
Heart, and the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, in the belief that his support lent 
strength to the voice of each organiza-
tion. 
Gerald was also a leading advocate 
for opening a Tennessee State Vet-
erans’ Home in Knox County. Thanks 
to his efforts, Ben Atchley Tennessee 
State Veterans’ Home opened in 2006, 
and my father actually passed away in 
that veterans’ home, so I hold it very 
close to my heart, Madam Speaker. 
It is my honor to salute Gerald Clark 
one final time here on the House floor. 
He will be greatly missed.

Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the incredible 
staff of the Delaware County COVID–19 
task force, led by Rosemarie Halt, for 
their amazing work, along with the 
thousands of volunteers from the DelCo 
Medical Reserve Corps and the DelCo 
Citizen Corps who have created and im-
plemented new systems to test, feed, 
and vaccinate tens of thousands of peo-
ple in our community. 
These folks have been working day 
and night to help guide the residents of 
Delaware County through the chal-
lenges of a once-in-a-century pan-
demic. In an ever-changing landscape, 
they have distributed supplies, coordi-
nated communication, and are now 
helping to ensure that everyone gets 
vaccinated. 
I am proud to honor them today dur-
ing National Volunteer Week to cele-
brate those working behind the scenes 
to get us back to normal. 
Rosemarie, her staff, and the DelCo 
volunteers have been critical to the re-
sponse and relief efforts in our district. 
For over a year, it has been all hands 
on deck, and we cannot thank them 
enough for their service.

CONGRATULATING TONY SCHMITZ 
ON HIS ACCEPTANCE TO WEST 
POINT 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
young man in Iowa’s Second Congres-
sional 
District 
with 
an 
incredibly 
bright future. 
On June 28, Pella High School senior 
Tony Schmitz will enroll as a cadet at 
the United States Military Academy in 
West Point, New York. 
Everyone knows just how tough it is 
to get into West Point, with its 12 per-
cent acceptance rate, but getting in is 
only the beginning. As a 24-year vet-
eran of the Army myself, I can speak 
firsthand of the challenging, fulfilling, 
and exciting journey Tony is about to 
begin. 
As the school year starts to wind 
down, I also want to remind all rising 
seniors in the Second District to reach 
out to my office if you have an interest 
in applying to any or attending one of 
our four amazing service academies. 
Once again, congratulations to Tony, 
and always remember: Go Army, beat 
Navy.

WISHING 
LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL 
RETIRED 
SAM 
MULRAIN 
A 
HAPPY 104TH BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. MACE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to wish a very happy birthday to a 
South Carolina hero, a community 
leader and someone who just yesterday 
turned 104 years young, Lieutenant 
Colonel Retired Sam Mulrain. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mulrain has done 
so much in his life and I am proud to 
recognize him today, and I am grateful 
for all of his accomplishments. His leg-
acy is inspirational to our Nation and 
the Lowcountry. We owe Lieutenant 
Colonel Mulrain so much for his con-
tributions, both in military service and 
in his humanitarian efforts. 
He was part of the Greatest Genera-
tion, storming the beaches of Nor-
mandy where he was wounded and re-
ceived the Purple Heart. He played 
baseball with Hall of Famer Phil ‘‘The 
Scooter’’ Rizzuto. 
In and around Hilton Head, the com-
munity knows him for his tireless dedi-
cation to public service. 
Today, we in Congress, wish Sam a 
very happy birthday.

STANDING UP FOR THE 
VOICELESS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I proudly signed a discharge 
petition in order to vote on the Born- 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act. 
Along 
with 
my 
Republican 
col-
leagues, we are standing up for the 
voiceless to end this ongoing tragedy 
once and for all. We must end infan-
ticide. 
Seventy-seven percent of Americans 
support protections for babies born 
alive after a failed abortion, but 
Speaker PELOSI refuses to bring up the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act for a vote. 
This legislation is long overdue. It is 
time to stand up to Speaker PELOSI and 
the radical Democrats’ lack of regard 
for human life and pass the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act. 
My heart aches in all instances when 
the dignity of human life is violated. 
As a Christian, I believe that the image 
of God in each one of us gives us intrin-
sic worth that cannot be assaulted. 
This bill simply requires an abor-
tionist to give lifesaving treatment to 
a child who survives a botched abortion 
rather than let them die slowly.

follows: 
‘‘(f) AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND OR RESTRICT THE 
ENTRY OF A CLASS OF ALIENS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), if 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with the

or public safety of the United States or the pres-
ervation of human rights, democratic processes

priate.

‘‘(3) CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Prior to the President exer-
cising the authority under paragraph (1), the

tion, including how such action complies with 
paragraph (2), as well as any intelligence in-
forming such actions. 
‘‘(C) TERMINATION.—If the briefing and report

harmed by a violation of this subsection may file 
an action in an appropriate district court of the 
United States to seek declaratory or injunctive 
relief. 
‘‘(B) CLASS ACTION.—Nothing in this Act may

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1333. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1333, the Na-
tional Origin-Based Antidiscrimination 
for Nonimmigrants Act, or NO BAN 
Act, is an important step toward rein-
ing in executive overreach and pre-
serving the power of Congress to estab-
lish our Nation’s immigration laws. 
Section 212(f) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, the INA, authorizes 
the President to suspend the entry of 
noncitizens when the President finds 
that their entry would be detrimental 
to U.S. interests. 
From 1952, when this provision was 
enacted, until January 2017, Presidents 
of both parties invoked section 212(f) to 
exclude only narrow groups of individ-
uals, such as human rights violators, 
North Korean officials, and individuals 
seeking to overthrow governments, for 
reasons that would clearly serve the 
national interest. 
But former President Trump abused 
this authority, twisting it in ways that 
were never intended. He first used it to 
deliver on his campaign promise to ban 
Muslims from the United States, an 
immoral and disastrous policy that 
traumatized children and families and 
made us no safer, while weakening our 
standing in the world. 
The former President then used this 
section to rewrite immigration laws 
with which he disagreed. For example, 
the INA expressly provides asylum eli-
gibility to any individual who arrives 
in the United States ‘‘whether or not 
at a designated port of arrival.’’ How-
ever, President Trump invoked section 
212(f) to deny asylum to persons who 
cross the southern border between 
ports of entry, in direct conflict with 
the statute. Fortunately, the judiciary 
agreed that this was unlawful and 
stopped the policy from taking effect. 
H.R. 1333 will prevent such executive 
overreach by amending section 212(f) to 
ensure it is used in a manner con-
sistent with its intended purpose and 
historical norms. 
Although President Biden has re-
pealed the egregious orders of the 
Trump era, including the Muslim ban, 
we must pass the NO BAN Act to en-
sure that this authority is never 
abused again. In advancing this legisla-
tion today, we uphold our Nation’s 
founding ideals and reaffirm our com-
mitment to the rule of law. 
This should not be a partisan issue. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
should agree that no President, Repub-
lican or Democratic, should be per-
mitted to usurp the powers of the legis-
lative branch enshrined in the Con-
stitution. The separation of powers is 
fundamental to our democratic Repub-
lic, and it must be protected. 
I would like to thank my friend and 
colleague, Representative JUDY
CHU, 
for her leadership and her steadfast 
commitment to this issue. Her efforts 
led to the introduction of the NO BAN 
Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), the 
ranking member of the Immigration 
and Citizenship Subcommittee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
this bill presents a very simple ques-
tion: Should we all but strip the Presi-
dent of his authority to restrict travel 
from countries that pose a danger to 
the United States? 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush used 
this authority to protect our country. 
So, too, did Barack Obama and even 
Joe Biden as recently as January 25. 
President Trump invoked this au-
thority against countries that were 
hotbeds of international terrorism and 
that were not cooperating with the 
United States in providing basic infor-
mation about travelers coming from 
these countries. Now, the left calls it a 
Muslim ban. What nonsense. The Presi-
dent’s orders affected only a tiny frac-
tion of Muslim-majority countries and 
a sizable number of non-Muslim coun-
tries. The Supreme Court cited this ob-
vious truth when it fully upheld the 
President’s actions. In fact, when a 
rogue government changed its policy 
and cooperated with us, the restric-
tions were lifted. 
Without this authority, the Presi-
dent would have been powerless to take 
simple, prudent precautions against 
terrorists and criminals from entering 
the United States. 
The President’s ability to protect 
against threats, negotiate security pro-
tocols, and, when necessary, retaliate 
against 
discriminatory 
actions 
by 
other countries depends on his having 
this power at his immediate disposal. 
This bill, instead, forbids the Presi-
dent from taking action until he can 
show that it is the weakest possible 
measure at his disposal. It requires him 
to get his own Secretary of State’s per-
mission, which is a constitutional ab-
surdity, and it gives anyone who 
claims any harm the standing to block 
an order in Federal district court. 
So, I ask, in this world that is becom-
ing increasingly threatening and un-
stable, does this bill make us more safe 
or less safe? The answer should be self- 
evident to anyone who is not com-
pletely besotted with the woke insan-
ity of the radical left. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU), the author 
of this legislation. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of my legisla-
tion, the NO BAN Act. 
The Muslim ban was always wrong, 
needless, and cruel. Today, we can 
make sure it never happens again. 
First, this policy was wrong. America 
does not ban people because of their re-
ligion, and the Supreme Court ac-
knowledged this. When they upheld the

H2007 
April 21, 2021 
third iteration of Trump’s Muslim ban, 
the Court insisted that, in order to 
prove this wasn’t just a religious ban, 
the Trump administration would have 
to issue waivers to allow those we 
know not to be a threat to travel here. 
But that waiver process was a sham, 
with almost all requests ignored, prov-
ing the purpose of the ban was to keep 
Muslims out of the country, just as 
Donald Trump always said it was. 
Second, the policy was needless. As 
the Supreme Court’s waiver require-
ment recognized, America has the best 
and strongest vetting system in the 
world. Many of those stopped by the 
Muslim ban had been vetted by U.S. of-
ficials many times over many years. I 
have met with many of them myself. 
These are people who are trying to es-
cape dangerous situations or who sim-
ply wanted a chance at a better life. 
They turned to the U.S., as countless 
others have done over the generations. 
But instead of opportunity, they were 
met with bigotry, sometimes just days 
before they were supposed to arrive 
here. 
Which is why, thirdly, this ban was 
about cruelty. Afraid to leave America 
out of fear they wouldn’t be able to re-
turn, or unable to visit here at all, 
families were intentionally isolated 
from each other, missing weddings, fu-
nerals, births, and graduations. 
This past year has shown us what the 
impact of missing such milestones feels 
like. To do it deliberately is inexcus-
able. 
Thousands of families were separated 
by this policy simply because of a lie 
that Muslims are dangerous, a lie that 
encouraged bigotry and xenophobia, 
even as hate crimes are on the rise. 
Fortunately, President Biden under-
stood the harm of this policy and re-
scinded the Muslim bans on his first 
day in office. But we must make sure 
no President is ever able to ban people 
from coming to the U.S. simply be-
cause of their religion, which is why I 
am so pleased that we are voting to 
pass the NO BAN Act today. 
While preserving a President’s ability 
to respond to national emergencies 
like pandemics, this bill amends the 
Immigration and Nationality Act to re-
quire that any future travel ban is 
based on credible facts and actual 
threats. The bill also requires the 
President to work in consultation with 
the Departments of State and Home-
land Security to provide evidence of 
why a ban is needed in the first place. 
I am so grateful to Chairman NAD-
LER, as well as my House and Senate 
cosponsors, for their support, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, if this 
bill passes, the President may only act 
if the Secretary of State allows him to 
act, and that is backward. The Sec-
retary of State should not be author-
ized in statute to tell the President, 
the Secretary of State’s boss, that the 
President may act. It is antithetical to 
the executive powers as set forth in the 
United States Constitution. 
Let me say that again. H.R. 1333 
gives the authority to initiate a sus-
pension of entry not to the President 
but to the Secretary of State in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Home-
land Security. 
But it is the President, in whom all 
executive power vests, who should de-
termine whether to suspend entry and 
not just in consultation with or the 
permission of the State and Homeland 
Security Departments. 
While we are discussing this, we have 
a crisis on our border, a crisis created 
by this President. For months, he re-
fused to acknowledge the crisis. When 
he accidentally slipped and said it was 
a crisis, we were later told he didn’t 
really mean it was a crisis. 
Well, here is the deal. You are hous-
ing illegal aliens in hotels. That is the 
kind of crisis this has become. The sit-
uation is so bad that the Biden admin-
istration has reopened and expanded fa-
cilities to house illegal aliens who have 
surged across the border. 
President Biden inherited a secure 
border and policies that were working 
and, instead, has created an inhumane 
border crisis. 
If he wants to solve the crisis, he 
needs to finish construction of the 
wall; reinstate the migrant protection 
protocols; reinstate the asylum cooper-
ative agreements with Honduras, Gua-
temala, and El Salvador; and remove 
the other incentives to come, like 
$1,400 from the COVID package that 
was just recently passed. 
He can bring it under control, but the 
best way to bring it under control is to 
move immigration judges to the south-
ern border to deal with asylum cases 
that are occurring today, not the back-
log. Those people are already in here. 
Deal with those cases today. 
Getting back to this bill, it is rep-
resentative of an executive branch that 
is willing to give over and cede Presi-
dential authority to Cabinet members 
instead of the President himself. This 
bill should not be passed. It should not 
even be considered.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 1333, the 
NO BAN Act. 
This legislation would prevent future 
abuses of power committed by the pre-
vious 
administration 
through 
its 
xenophobic Muslim ban, a despicable 
policy which undermined one of our 
Nation’s founding principles, freedom 
of religion. 
My home State of Rhode Island was 
established by Roger Williams on the 
principle of religious liberty and sepa-
ration of church and state, and his 
leadership inspired the Framers of our 
Constitution to incorporate these prin-
ciples into our founding documents. 
This legislation will help to preserve 
that principle. 
From the very beginning, former 
President Trump was clear about ex-
actly what his policy was, an explicit 
attempt to keep out as many people 
from Muslim-majority countries as 
possible, regardless of whether they 
were seeking refuge or asylum. It was 
never designed to make us safer. It was 
simply a way to spark fear and hatred 
among our citizens. 
On his first day in office, thankfully, 
President Biden rescinded this policy. 
Yet the impact of the Muslim ban re-
mains. After 4 years of having this pol-
icy in place, the time it takes to re-
implement normal immigration and 
travel policies brings delays in other-
wise routine procedures, such as ob-
taining visas, thus delaying the re-
union of families. 
Thankfully, however, with the Mus-
lim ban rescinded, those families can 
take comfort in knowing they are a 
step closer to once again being with 
their loved ones. 
Despite this, it remains necessary to 
pass this NO BAN Act. Without making 
the necessary reforms to prevent the 
abuses of power of the previous admin-
istration, they could simply be put 
back in place by a future President. 
The NO BAN Act makes it unequivo-
cally clear that we stand by the Amer-
ican ideal of freedom of religion. It will 
provide the necessary limitations on 
the President’s ability to use overly 
broad terms to inappropriately and in-
discriminately target and label entire 
groups of racial, ethnic, or religious 
minorities because of who they choose 
to worship. 
We must not tolerate discriminatory 
actions that undermine our core values 
and threaten our Nation’s health and 
safety. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support passage of the NO 
BAN Act. I thank the chairman of the 
committee for his leadership, and I 
thank Congresswoman JUDY CHU for 
her extraordinary leadership in this re-
gard. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, at 
the heart of Democrats’ border secu-
rity policies is the assumption that 
America can assume an unlimited 
number of illegal immigrants without 
considering its impact on jobs, commu-
nities, security, and, in today’s world, 
health. 
This assumption defies all historical 
evidence. More importantly, it defies 
the evidence right before our very eyes. 
Madam Speaker, in the last month 
alone, Border Patrol apprehended the 
largest surge of migrants in 20 years, 
172,000 individuals in one single month. 
By September, we are on track to en-
counter 2 million illegal immigrants. 
Now, that is about twice the size of the 
population 
of 
Delaware, 
President 
Biden’s home State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2008 
April 21, 2021 
The surge was directly caused by the 
actions of the Biden administration. 
On day one, President Biden issued five 
executive orders that reversed the com-
monsense immigration policies that 
were working. 
Then his administration sent mixed 
signals to migrants that now is not the 
time to come, but promising not to de-
port children and many families. 
Now, 
as 
Monday’s 
order 
dem-
onstrates, the White House is more 
concerned with policing Border Pa-
trol’s language than it is protecting 
our border. 
I am very glad that President Biden 
finally admitted that there is a crisis 
at the border, but what we really need 
is for him to admit that his policies 
and rhetoric caused the crisis to begin 
with. 
The results of this crisis are as pre-
dictable as they are disastrous, for 
both migrants and American citizens. 
Just this past weekend, the Biden ad-
ministration was forced to shut down a 
Houston migrant center for children 
because of unbearable conditions. Hun-
dreds of unaccompanied minors had to 
be shuttled somewhere else. 
I know everybody in this body under-
stands that that is heartbreaking. It is 
also a public health risk. That is be-
cause the Biden administration is re-
leasing migrants into American cities 
without negative COVID tests, without 
court dates, and without a way to 
track where they will go. Already, that 
number is up to 15,000. 
Now, Madam Speaker, that doesn’t 
come from me. I saw it on the news 
today from a Democratic colleague 
who put this number out and said it 
was disastrous. 
But the border crisis isn’t just a hu-
manitarian and public health crisis. It 
is also a national security crisis. Last 
month, I shared some alarming news. 
When I was down on the border, I was 
speaking to the Border Patrol agents, 
and they informed me that individuals 
on the terrorist watch list were caught 
trying to enter our country. 
Madam Speaker, I know how much 
you care about protecting this country 
from terrorism. I thought everybody on 
your side of the aisle would care just as 
much. 
Unfortunately, 
Congressman 
GALLEGO
accused me of lying. Con-
gresswoman ESCOBAR said I was trying 
to fuel division, Madam Speaker. 
But the Customs and Border Protec-
tion agency confirmed that four sus-
pected terrorists had been caught. 
Since then, more suspected terrorists 
have been caught at different times 
and different places, from Yemen, but 
not on the same day; two different in-
dividuals. 
Now, I am sure, maybe because of the 
challenges with COVID and the dis-
tance we must keep, that I have not re-
ceived the apology of being accused of 
being a liar on a national security 
issue, but I assume that will come 
shortly. 
The security problem also includes a 
flow of drugs. When I was on that same 
border in El Paso, talking to some of 
those same agents, they told me they 
have never seen the amount of fentanyl 
that has come across the border in the 
last month. Americans are dying be-
cause the cartels are exploiting the 
Biden border crisis to make a profit. 
Fentanyl overdoses are surging across 
the country. 
Now, in my home State, Madam 
Speaker, the Speaker’s hometown of 
San Francisco saw more fentanyl-re-
lated deaths last year than COVID-re-
lated deaths, according to The Wall 
Street Journal. 
Madam Speaker, it is hard to imag-
ine anything more shortsighted than 
doubling down on Biden’s failed border 
policies. But, incredibly, as I sit on this 
floor, the House Democrats want to re-
spond to this humanitarian, public 
health, and national security crisis by 
passing recycled legislation from the 
last Congress. 
I know, Madam Speaker, the Speaker 
doesn’t want us to work in committees 
and wants to do it from afar, but I still 
think we could have new ideas to a big-
ger problem created by a new adminis-
tration. 
They want to strip future Presidents 
of their authority to keep Americans 
safe. That is what the NO BAN Act 
does. 
They also want to grant foreign na-
tionals access to lawyers. But foreign 
nationals have never been entitled to 
this privilege before, and it will cost 
taxpayers $825 million over the next 5 
years. That may not sound like much if 
you just want to throw trillions out 
there, but that is hardworking tax-
payers’ money. It is a lot of money. 
But are Democrats working to repair 
the crisis its radical policies caused? 
No. 
Are they working to stop the mass 
flow of illegal migration? No. 
Are they working to secure our bor-
ders? No. 
Vice President Harris has refused to 
visit the border for 28 days. 
By contrast, more than one-third of 
the House Republicans have been to 
the border and seen the crisis for them-
selves. There have even been some bi-
partisan trips, Madam Speaker. And I 
was very excited to hear that, in the 
bipartisan trip, questions were asked. 
My understanding was the very first 
question one of our Democrat col-
leagues asked was: Is it really true we 
are catching terrorists? 
And the shock on their face when the 
border agent said: Yes, from the ter-
rorist watch list, we have caught them. 
What is really concerning to me, if 
you read The Washington Post, is the 
thousands of people who come across 
per day who are not caught. 
How many terrorists are in that 
group? How much fentanyl are those 
people carrying? 
What we learned has led directly to 
the action we have taken here in Con-
gress. 
Two weeks ago, Dr. MILLER-MEEKS 
introduced a bill to require a negative 
COVID–19 test before any illegal immi-
grant is released from custody. 
Madam Speaker, I was shocked that 
your side of the aisle blocked it. 
Last week, Representative CARTER 
and Representative PETER MEIJER of-
fered a motion to combat the traf-
ficking of fentanyl analogues, which 
are 100 times deadlier than regular 
fentanyl. 
Democrats blocked it, even though 
137 of them voted for the same motion 
last year. 
Can you imagine that, Madam Speak-
er? 137 on your side of the aisle voted 
just last year for that amendment. I 
guess things have changed. 
Madam Speaker, Congress needs to 
do the right thing here. We should not 
be wasting our time on recycled legis-
lation that weakens our national secu-
rity. We simply need to return to com-
monsense border security policies that 
work. 
We need to finish the wall and deploy 
technology to the border. 
We need to fully reinstate the ‘‘re-
main in Mexico’’ policy and maintain 
the robustly implemented Title 42 au-
thority. 
We need to require a negative COVID 
test before releasing migrants. I think 
that would be common sense. Most 
Americans have to have that. 
We need to send a clear message: Do 
not come to the United States ille-
gally. 
Madam Speaker, if we want to fix the 
crisis, we need to fix its root cause. But 
that root cause isn’t only in Guate-
mala, El Salvador, or Honduras; it is 
right here in Washington, D.C. 
You see, Madam Speaker, before the 
crisis hit, there wasn’t legislation that 
was passed. It was just on day one with 
executive orders. So all they have to do 
is do the exact same thing they did, 
take the pen and bring them back. 
Let’s bring common sense back to solu-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, why don’t we bring 
new ideas to committees? Why don’t 
we have Members show up for work? 
And why don’t we have committees ac-
tually work instead of just picking old 
ideas when they have created a new 
problem that will only expand it fur-
ther? 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for his leader-
ship, and I thank Congresswoman JUDY 
CHU for her leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise with great en-
thusiasm for the National Origin-Based 
Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants 
Act, and that is the NO BAN Act. 
I proclaim a breath of fresh air, and 
that was the election of 2020 and the in-
auguration of President Joe Biden and 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, who 
made it very clear what our position is 
as it relates to those who come to this 
country.

H2009 
April 21, 2021 
First of all, they did not turn a blind 
eye to the Statue of Liberty, which ac-
knowledges the fact that we are a ref-
uge for those who are fleeing persecu-
tion. They also understood that we are 
not 
a 
country 
that 
discriminates 
against individuals simply because of 
their religion. That is what the NO 
BAN Act represented. It had nothing to 
do with terrorism. 
I wonder why President Trump never 
said anything about domestic terror-
ists? Why didn’t they have a structure 
to ban them, the very terrorists that 
jumped this Capitol on January 6th? 
I am reminded of a little 15-year-old 
on the day that the ban was issued. 
When I was flying in from Washington, 
I went straight over to the inter-
national terminal because my staff had 
called me and others had called me. 
This little boy, innocent, with legal 
documents, a tourist visa, coming to 
visit his family, innocently indicated 
who he was. And, of course, by law, 
those CBP officers had to detain him. 
b 1300 
Do you know what was worse? He was 
not able to see anyone at that time, 
but more importantly, he wound up in 
Chicago. 
And so I rise to support the NO BAN 
Act, and I indicate that there is a pol-
icy. The border is closed. The Vice 
President will be working on a broader 
plan for dealing with the border. The 
shelter in Houston was a temporary 
shelter. It was an emergency shelter. It 
was rightly closed when other beds 
were found. 130 of those children were 
reunited with their families. This bill 
is important. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am delighted that this bill includes 
an important provision of mine offered 
last year during the committee mark-
up, which requires the administration 
to report to Congress on the impacts, 
positive, negative, and unintended of 
any action by the President pursuant 
to executive orders. 
We know that banning Nigeria was 
the wrong thing to do, and I support 
the NO BAN Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, this is 
a dangerous piece of legislation that 
comes at a time when our national se-
curity and our public health are being 
threatened by a dire crisis at our 
southern border. 
Only Democrats would bring a bill to 
the floor during a surge at our south-
ern border that would make it easier 
for terrorists to enter our country. As 
someone who served in the war on ter-
ror and served in Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, the last thing we should be doing 
as a Nation is making it easier for ter-
rorists in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and other 
terrorist-harboring nations to travel to 
the United States. 
Despite the harrowing statistics we 
see coming from the southern border 
with record-setting numbers of illegal 
crossings and unaccompanied minors, 
my colleagues on the left continue to 
ignore and downplay the actual facts, 
while terrorists and COVID-positive il-
legal immigrants are granted unprece-
dented access to our country. 
The Biden administration has driven 
illegal crossings up to historic highs by 
encouraging more illegal immigration 
and 
loosening 
restrictions 
to 
give 
criminals a free pass. These policy re-
versals, and now this legislation, will 
be directly responsible for what will go 
down in history as our biggest failure 
of border security in our lifetime. 
Now, rather than addressing the hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal border 
crossings this year, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are still 
spending their time trying to attack 
the successful policies from the Trump 
administration that actually drove our 
border numbers down and kept Ameri-
cans safe. 
Rather than attacking the Trump ad-
ministration at the expense of the 
American people, my colleagues on the 
left should instead think about spend-
ing their time trying to reinstate some 
of his policies that were proven effec-
tive, like continuing border wall con-
struction or ending chain migration. 
Even more hypocritical, while telling 
American citizens to stay home from 
work, school and to refrain from nor-
mal life due to a global pandemic, leg-
islation like this keeps sending the 
message to illegal aliens, even those 
from dangerous countries, that the 
United States is open for them to flood 
our borders and be taken care of by our 
taxpayers. 
At a time when there is a border cri-
sis, a global pandemic, and emerging 
national security threats, we should 
not be handicapping any current or fu-
ture President from exercising their 
executive authority to keep our coun-
try safe. 
In fact, the Obama-Biden administra-
tion used this authority 19 times dur-
ing their administration. The only rea-
son why my colleagues are pushing this 
is because of their hatred for President 
Trump and his actions to restrict entry 
from certain countries that protected 
our national security. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the dis-
tinguished chairperson of the Immigra-
tion and Citizenship Subcommittee. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, this 
is an important step towards the enact-
ment of the NO BAN Act, which would 
prevent overreach in a President’s au-
thority to suspend the entry of nonciti-
zens into the United States under sec-
tion 212(f) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act. 
As a candidate for President, Donald 
Trump promised to ban ‘‘all Muslims’’ 
from entering the U.S., and he sug-
gested without any evidence that it 
would somehow make our country 
safer. 
Immediately after his election and 
swearing in, he tried to deliver on that 
promise by using section 212(f), claim-
ing the admission of individuals from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 
countries 
would be detrimental to the U.S. inter-
ests. 
In court, the Trump administration 
claimed the ban was necessary to keep 
our country safe from terrorists. And 
yet, a bipartisan coalition of former 
national security officials strongly re-
buked those claims. 
In addition to this ban, President 
Trump also relied on section 212(f) to 
circumvent clear statutory require-
ments related to asylum. Section 208 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act 
specifically allows individuals to apply 
for asylum ‘‘whether or not they arrive 
at a designated port of arrival.’’ 
The law could not be clearer. But ap-
parently unhappy with it, the Presi-
dent invoked section 212(f) to categori-
cally deny asylum to those who cross 
the border between ports of entry rath-
er than seeking to amend the law by 
working with Congress. 
This was an attempt to rewrite our 
Nation’s immigration laws in direct 
violation of the constitutional separa-
tion of powers. The power to write the 
law is ours, not the President’s. 
Fortunately, this ban has now been 
reversed by President Biden, but this 
bill is still important. It is important 
to take action to prevent any future 
President from trying to usurp the leg-
islative power of the Congress. 
I thank Representative CHU for her 
persistence in pursuing this bill, and I 
think it is important to note that the 
President, if this bill passes, retains 
ample authority to act in the national 
interests of the United States to pro-
tect our security. 
The bill allows the President to sus-
pend the entry of individuals or class of 
individuals if he determines that they 
would undermine the security of the 
United States. 
To be clear, under the current bill, if 
the President determines there is a na-
tional security issue related to a par-
ticular country that is so significant 
that it could only be addressed by sus-
pending the admission of all nationals 
of that country, the President could 
still do so. 
It is important that we also address 
the issue of children at the border. This 
bill isn’t about children at the border. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we 
can do more than one thing at once. We 
need to make sure that the law is ad-
hered to by the President. We also need 
to deal with the issue of unaccom-
panied children at the border and deal 
with the crisis in Central America that 
is causing it.

H2010 
April 21, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, 172,331 border patrol 
apprehensions in March, a 233 percent 
increase in fentanyl seized, the worst 
crisis in 15 years, but more than that, 
no peak in sight. 
President Biden and the Democratic 
majority bury their heads in the sand. 
They have put the United States Gov-
ernment, charged with enforcing the 
border, in the service of Mexican drug 
cartels and their criminal enterprises. I 
have been there. I have heard from the 
CBP. 
And Democrats choose this moment 
to advance this bill to hobble the au-
thority of the President of the United 
States to protect the Nation by exclud-
ing foreign nationals he or she might 
identify as posing a danger. Think 
North Korea. 
In fact, they strip the President and 
transfer to the secretary of state and 
Homeland 
Security 
the 
President’s 
longstanding authority to protect the 
Nation in this way. 
And in case you would have con-
cluded otherwise by the rhetoric, this 
is not limited to a religious criteria for 
entry. 
I offered an amendment in the Judi-
ciary Committee to defer the effective-
ness of this unwise legislation—to un-
derstate—until the current crisis can 
be brought under control by restoring 
the Trump administration’s successful 
remain in Mexico policy. But Demo-
crats rejected that and refused to con-
sider it on the floor. 
Customs and Border Protection ad-
vised us on our trip the week before 
last that they told the administration 
revoking the remain in Mexico policy 
would cause a disaster. But they did it 
anyway. 
And here they have doubled down. 
Just the latest evidence that today’s 
crisis is intentional. There is no inten-
tion to control it. There is an inten-
tion, yes, there is a plan, but the plan 
is to build out the capacity for bring-
ing people illegally into the United 
States. This is a crisis. They serve not 
the people of America. You can’t have 
a country if you don’t have a voice. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair for his 
yielding and for his leadership. 
The foundational model of this coun-
try is e pluribus unum, out of many, 
one. It doesn’t say out of many Euro-
peans, one. It doesn’t say out of many 
Anglo-Saxons, one. It doesn’t say out 
of many Confederate sympathizers, 
one. It doesn’t say out of many Chris-
tians, one. It certainly doesn’t say out 
of many nations, except Muslim coun-
tries, one. 
E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. 
That is what makes America a great 
country. 
And 
no 
matter 
what 
xenophobic behavior is coming out of 
the halls of power in this country, we 
are not going to let anyone take that 
away from us; not now, not ever. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the NO BAN Act so we 
can continue our country’s long, nec-
essary, and majestic march toward a 
more perfect Union. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, wow, 
the rhetoric is hot today. Bigotry, xen-
ophobia, Muslim ban, racism, discrimi-
nation. This is what is coming from the 
left side of the aisle. 
They 
say 
that 
Biden 
rescinded 
Trump’s Muslim ban—that he has re-
scinded the Muslim ban. I want to ask 
them: Which Muslim ban are they talk-
ing about? Which one are they talking 
about? Are they talking about the one 
they voted for? 
By the way, I think it is inappro-
priate to call it a ‘‘Muslim ban.’’ But 
let’s use their language. Are they talk-
ing about the bill that 165 of them 
voted for, including the chairman of 
this committee, the author of this bill, 
and 
the 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
sub-
committee? 
Are they talking about the bill that 
they all voted for in 2015 that Obama 
signed into law called the Visa Waiver 
Program Improvement and Terrorist 
Travel Prevention Act of 2015? I don’t 
think Trump was President in 2015. 
Obama signed this bill. 
What did it do? It named four coun-
tries, not seven. We will get to the 
seven later. It named four countries to 
ban. 
What were those four countries? By 
the way, the ACLU was not happy 
about this when Obama and the Demo-
crats on the other side of the aisle did 
it. Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan. 
And now the Democrats are com-
plaining that the President has too 
much power to protect this country, 
and they want to take some of this 
back, but they gave Obama the power 
to add three more countries. What were 
the three he added? Libya, Somalia, 
and Yemen in 2016. Interesting. 
So where does that bring us to? It 
gets us to seven countries. Did they 
overlap or are they maybe five of the 
same countries? It is the seven exact 
same countries that the Democrats 
voted for that everybody over on the 
other side of the aisle who is hurling 
these claims of xenophobia voted for. 
Those same seven countries are now in 
and on the website at the State Depart-
ment that Joe Biden runs. 
Now, what does this do? Again, I 
want to be clear. It is not a total ban. 
But, by the way, Trump’s wasn’t ei-
ther. It was a temporary suspension. 
But what they have done, and what Joe 
Biden perpetuates on these same seven 
countries—this is not a Muslim ban, 
but he is doing it to the same seven 
countries, perpetuating the Terrorist 
Travel Prevention Act of 2015, he is 
saying you can’t get a visa waiver if 
you are from one of those seven coun-
tries. 
Now which is worse? I mean, you can 
say, okay, it is not racist to just make 
it harder to travel, if we do it for 5 
years or do it forever, that is not racist 
or xenophobic. But if you do it for six 
months, like Trump proposed, 180 days, 
well, now that is racist right there. 
This is so ridiculous. I can’t even be-
lieve they have the audacity to pretend 
they didn’t vote in 2015 to add these 
seven countries. 
Let’s just get back to protecting this 
country. Let’s not use these bills and 
these provisions to say that one side is 
racist, or one side is xenophobic, or you 
are a bunch of bigots. President Obama 
was not xenophobic when he put these 
seven countries on his list, because 
they were the seven countries that the 
Democrats on the other side of the 
aisle chose. They are the seven coun-
tries that Obama chose. 
I say, let’s protect this country and 
get back to working together. 
[From the State Department website] 
VISA WAIVER PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT AND 
TERRORIST TRAVEL PREVENTION ACT OF 2015 
Under the Visa Waiver Program Improve-
ment and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 
2015, travelers in the following categories 
must obtain a visa prior to traveling to the 
United States as they are no longer eligible 
to travel under the Visa Waiver Program 
(VWP): 
Nationals of VWP countries who have trav-
eled to or been present in Democratic Peo-
ple’s Republic of Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen on or after 
March 1, 2011 (with limited exceptions for 
travel for diplomatic or military purposes in 
the service of a VWP country). 
Nationals of VWP countries who are also 
nationals of Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria. 
These individuals can apply for visas using 
regular appointment processes at a U.S. Em-
bassy or Consulate. For those who require a 
visa for urgent travel to the United States, 
U.S. Embassies and Consulates stand ready 
to handle applications on an expedited basis. 
If an individual who is exempt from the 
Act because of his or her diplomatic or mili-
tary presence in one of the seven countries 
has his or her ESTA denied, he or she may go 
to the CSP website, or contact the CSP in-
formation Center. The traveler may also 
apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. Em-
bassy or Consulate. 
U.S. 
Customs 
and 
Border 
Protection 
strongly recommends that any traveler to 
the United States check his or her ESTA sta-
tus prior to making any travel reservations 
or travelling to the United States. More in-
formation is available on the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) website.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the NO BAN 
Act, and I thank Congresswoman CHU 
for her leadership. 
Yes, let’s get back to protecting 
America. That is what we want to do. 
Madam Speaker, Anahita is an asylee

never happened. Due to Trump’s Mus-
lim ban, Anahita could not get travel 
documents to see her dad before he died 
or to mourn with her family. 
Madam Speaker, for 4 years, families 
remained separated. That is not the 
America we want to protect. 
American businesses and universities 
couldn’t recruit top candidates, and 
our Nation’s doors were closed to peo-
ple seeking refuge. 
President Biden rescinded the bans, 
but we must pass the NO BAN Act to 
prohibit any future President from 
issuing discriminatory bans. 
Now, that day, I was in my first 
month here in Congress, when the Mus-
lim ban was passed. I rushed to the air-
port, along with our chairman and 
many other Members of Congress. We 
worked with attorneys to file the na-
tional lawsuits that called for an emer-
gency petition that blocked the Presi-
dent’s order from taking effect. 
We were also able, at Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport, to go onto the 
tarmac and stop a plane from taking 
off because of an emergency habeas 
from a judge there that allowed us to 
get two people back in who should have 
been here in the first place. 
Madam Speaker, just imagine the 
hearts and souls of people whose lives 
were thrown into chaos, thinking that 
they were going to land in the United 
States with valid travel documents and 
then were turned away by a President 
who issued a Muslim ban. The reason 
we need this bill is to make sure that 
that can never happen again. 
Madam Speaker, yes, we want to pro-
tect America’s values. We believe that 
the way to do that is to pass the NO 
BAN Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would note, for all 
of our friends and fellow citizens who 
are watching at home on C–SPAN, that 
you are seeing something go across 
your screen that says, ‘‘Prohibiting Re-
ligious-Based Travel Restrictions.’’ 
Well, to C–SPAN, I say: Be better. 
Don’t take the talking points from my 
Democrat colleagues about what we 
are actually debating here on the floor 
of the House because it is not that. 
What we are talking about is a power 
grab by Democrats who, for some rea-
son, want to continue to perpetuate 
the lie that there was ever a Muslim 
ban. It is literally not true. It is abso-
lutely not true. No matter how many 
times they say it, it doesn’t make it 
more true. 
For example, the gentlewoman re-
ferred to litigation. Let’s look at what 
the United States Supreme Court said 
precisely about what President Trump 
did to try to secure the United States 
from terrorists. Let’s remember what 
we are talking about. The President of 
the United States, President Trump, 
working to secure the United States 
from terrorists, the Court said: ‘‘The 
proclamation is expressly premised on 
legitimate purposes: preventing entry 
of nationals who cannot be adequately 
vetted and inducing other nations to 
improve their practices. The text says 
nothing about religion. Plaintiffs and 
the dissent nonetheless emphasize that 
five of the seven nations currently in-
cluded in the proclamation have Mus-
lim-majority populations. Yet, that 
fact alone does not support an infer-
ence of religious hostility, given that 
the policy covers just 8 percent of the 
world’s Muslim population and is lim-
ited to countries that were previously 
designated by Congress or prior admin-
istrations as posing national security 
risks,’’ as my friend from Kentucky 
just laid out. 
Madam Speaker, these are the facts. 
Do not listen to Democrat talking 
points being thrown on the screen on 
your C-Span. Do not listen to repeti-
tions and lies about Muslim bans when 
it is not true. The facts are completely 
opposite of that. 
Let’s also add one more point here. 
As we talk about this, our borders are 
wide open. As we talk about this, for-
eign nationals come in between ports 
of entry because Border Patrol is dis-
tracted, processing immigrants who 
come here because Democrat policies 
entice them to be abused by cartels 
while cartels have operational control 
of our border, while they create a 
narco-terrorist state in Mexico, and 
while they exist in the district that I 
represent, where children are in cars 
being driven by American citizen em-
ployees of the Cartel del Noreste, being 
taken to stash houses to be put into 
the sex trade. 
Then, we sit here and listen to this? 
This is what we are focusing on, taking 
away the constitutional authority of 
the President to protect us from ter-
rorists while terrorists are able to 
come into our southern border between 
ports of entry because my Democratic 
colleagues and this administration flat 
out refuse to do their job to secure the 
border of the United States? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 13 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 14 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, when 
the President first announced his Mus-
lim ban, I immediately went to LAX. I 
went because constituents were telling 
me that they couldn’t get their rel-
atives into the U.S. Individuals who 
were traveling to the U.S. that had 
been approved by the U.S. State De-
partment could not enter the U.S. I 
saw people who thought they were here 
for a regular, routine visit approved by 
the U.S. Government denied—denied on 
a whim. 
This bill is simply about making sure 
that no future President—Obama or 
Trump—will ever be able to deny entry 
into the U.S. based on religion or race. 
That is what the bill is. It is not about 
any specific President. It is about 
doing the right thing in America. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member JORDAN
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, right now, we have 
an immigration disaster at the south-
ern border of the Biden administra-
tion’s own creation. Instead of putting 
a stop to this madness, my colleagues 
across the aisle are encouraging this 
open borders agenda by bringing the 
NO BAN Act to the floor today. 
The NO BAN Act limits the Presi-
dent’s ability to make executive deci-
sions about who should be allowed to 
enter our country. This would dan-
gerously weaken the President’s execu-
tive authority on important issues re-
lated to national security. 
To put this reckless idea into per-
spective, Customs and Border Patrol 
agents recently caught two Yemeni 
terrorists 
at 
the 
southern 
border. 
Thank God, law enforcement caught 
these terrorists, but this is exactly why 
executive authority on immigration 
issues needs to remain in place. 
Madam Speaker, a responsible Presi-
dent would notice what is going on at 
the southern border and use his author-
ity to step in for the sake of national 
security. It is naive to believe there 
aren’t bad actors who want to hurt 
Americans actively trying to exploit 
this ongoing crisis. 
President Biden needs to use his ex-
ecutive authority to solve the immi-
gration and national security crisis his 
administration has created. If he is not 
physically or mentally capable of doing 
this, he should step down. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding and for his leadership. What a 
busy time in the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, bringing two bills to the floor 
today, with all the work that went into 
them under Chairman NADLER’s leader-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, here we are, under 
the gaze of our patriarch, George Wash-
ington, right there in this Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, 230 years ago, our 
patriarch, George Washington, who 
watches over us in this Chamber, fa-
mously wrote to the Hebrew Congrega-
tion of Newport, Rhode Island. In that 
letter, he made a promise that would 
be our Nation’s guide for centuries to 
come. 
He wrote: All possess ‘‘liberty of con-
science. . . . It is now no more that tol-
eration is spoken of, as if it was by the 
indulgence of one class of people that 
another enjoyed the exercise of their 
inherent natural rights.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2012 
April 21, 2021 
He went on to say: ‘‘For happily the 
Government of the United States, 
which gives to bigotry no sanction, to 
persecution 
no 
assistance, 
requires 
only that they who live under its pro-
tection should demean themselves as 
good citizens.’’ 
Today, by passing the NO BAN Act, 
the House is upholding that funda-
mental promise—‘‘to bigotry no sanc-
tion’’—by taking action to ensure that 
no President or administration can 
ever again abuse its authority by wag-
ing discrimination on the basis of reli-
gion. 
Madam Speaker, thank you to Chair 
JUDY CHU of CAPAC, our sponsor of 
this legislation and a national cham-
pion in combating discrimination and 
xenophobia, who has helped lead the 
Congress’ response to recent anti-AAPI 
attacks. 
The NO BAN Act strengthens the Im-
migration and Nationality Act to pro-
hibit discrimination on the basis of re-
ligion, and it restores the separation of 
powers by limiting overly broad execu-
tive action to issue future religious 
bans, which are fundamentally un- 
American. 
As Justice Sotomayor wrote, echoing 
President Washington, in her dissent in 
the shameful Trump v. Hawaii Su-
preme Court case upholding the last 
administration’s Muslim ban: ‘‘The 
United States of America is a Nation 
built upon the promise of religious lib-
erty. Our Founders honored that core 
promise by embedding the principle of 
religious 
neutrality 
in 
the 
First 
Amendment. 
The 
Court’s 
decision 
today’’ to uphold the Muslim ban ‘‘fails 
to safeguard that fundamental prin-
ciple.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I want to mention 
that when this happened 4 years ago, 
and the President came and did his 
Muslim ban legislation, we had a hear-
ing. It wasn’t an official hearing be-
cause we weren’t in the majority, and 
the majority wasn’t interested in hav-
ing it, but we had a hearing on it. 
What we saw in that hearing were 
leaders of the security community say-
ing that if this stays in place, it is 
going to hurt our national security be-
cause we will not be able to keep prom-
ises that we made to those who helped 
us in Afghanistan and Iraq. We won’t 
be able to because many of them are 
Muslim. 
Madam Speaker, a thousand dip-
lomats from the State Department— 
and this is highly unusual—signed on 
in opposition to what this did to us dip-
lomatically in the world. Our rank- 
and-file men and women spoke directly 
to the problem that this would create, 
the danger it created, in people trust-
ing our word when we asked them to 
help us and that we would help keep 
them safe. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard me 
quote, and PRAMILA
has heard me 
quote, again and again in that same 
hearing because many of the people 
who come here for asylum and refugee 
status because of religious persecution 
where they are from, the National As-
sociation of Evangelicals testified the 
following: ‘‘The United States’ refugee 
resettlement program is the crown 
jewel of American humanitarianism.’’ 
They were speaking in terms of reli-
gious refugees. 
Again, we cannot allow any Presi-
dent to abuse the power of his or her 
office in this regard. 
Madam Speaker, if I may, I would 
like to also address another piece of 
legislation, and I thank the chairman 
for bringing it to the floor, the Access 
to Counsel Act, protecting the civil lib-
erties of those who face prolonged de-
tention as they seek legal entry into 
the United States. Some of them are 
little children. 
This is a commonsense step to close 
a serious and dangerous gap in our im-
migration law that too often prevents 
the vulnerable from accessing not only 
legal counsel but also medical atten-
tion or contact with their families. 
b 1330 
I am always proud to salute Rep-
resentative 
PRAMILA
JAYAPAL, 
the 
sponsor of the Access to Counsel Act 
and a champion for the dignity and 
rights of all newcomers to our Nation— 
in fact, everyone in our Nation; and I 
thank her for her efforts. 
Passage of these bills, the NO BAN 
Act and the Access to Counsel Act, 
should not be controversial. Over 400 
immigrants’ rights bills organizations, 
faith-based 
organizations, 
business 
groups, and civil rights organizations 
support the NO BAN Act, and many 
more support the Access to Counsel 
Act. 
These bills are about honoring our 
Nation’s promise that, as President 
Washington said, we will give ‘‘to big-
otry no sanction; to persecution no as-
sistance.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote 
for both of these bills honoring the vi-
sion of our Founders, and the aspira-
tions of so many people in our country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
am from the great State of Texas, and 
there is nothing great about the crisis 
at our border. It is unprecedented. It is 
unmitigated. It is ever-escalating. It is 
absolutely, 
absolutely 
self-inflicted 
and avoidable. 
Because of the actions of our Com-
mander in Chief, whose first job is to 
protect the American people, and the 
irresponsible and reckless unilateral 
actions, we have got chaos at our 
southern border. The American people 
are suffering for it. The poor, vulner-
able people being abused by the cartels 
are suffering for it. Endless lists of 
tragedies because of what is happening 
and what is coming out of the White 
House. 
The answer, the solution in the midst 
of this crisis and disaster like we have 
never seen from my Democrat col-
leagues is to offer legislation to grant 
mass amnesty and citizenship; more 
green lights, more incentives, more 
welcome mats to continue to violate 
our sovereignty and to break our laws; 
not to be detained and deported, but to 
be released and rewarded, cut in line in 
front of millions of people. They don’t 
get a free lawyer paid for by the tax-
payers. 
I can’t believe this is happening in 
our great country. I can’t believe my 
Democrat colleagues are pouring gaso-
line and inflaming the situation with 
more of the NO BAN Act, tying the 
President’s hands to do his job, to pre-
vent high-risk folks from coming to 
the U.S., giving legal counsel, giving 
navigators and people who can help aid 
and abet the exploitation of our laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, it 
makes no sense at all. In fact, Madam 
Speaker, it is insulting. 
We care about people. This country 
does more for the immigrant than any 
in the world. We welcome those who 
want to make America their home, 
those God-fearing, freedom-loving fam-
ilies. But they have to respect our sov-
ereignty. They have to respect the 
safety and security of the American 
people. They have to respect our laws. 
And I am waiting for the Democrats 
to respect the laws of this land. On this 
issue, I am waiting. But this is spitting 
in the face of these families and com-
munities that are terrified. Ranchers 
are terrified to leave their families in 
their homes. 
And this is the answer? This is what 
you got? 
Shameful. It is shameful. I am em-
barrassed. 
Yes, I encourage my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the NO BAN Act. 
God bless America. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to begin just by correcting the un-
derstanding, I think, from the gen-
tleman from Kentucky, who tried to 
align President Obama’s temporary 
suspension of the Visa Waiver Program 
in foreign and southern countries with 
Donald Trump’s complete suspension of 
visas. 
As one of the two U.S. Ambassadors 
to serve in this Chamber at the mo-
ment, I presided over 4 years of con-
sular affairs. And the Visa Waiver Pro-
gram is when you are allowed to get 
into a country without the deep back-
ground checks, without going through 
Homeland Security. 
This is not what Donald Trump did. 
He suspended visas completely. 
By the way, this is not about the 
southern border. I don’t believe there is 
a single Muslim country south of the 
Rio Grande in the Western Hemisphere. 
Six years ago, then-Presidential can-
didate Donald Trump argued for a com-
plete and total Muslim ban. Remember,

he didn’t specify specific countries; he 
said no Muslims. 
I quickly produced a bill, the Free-
dom of Religion Act, to prohibit dis-
crimination in our immigration system 
on the basis of religious belief, and I 
rushed to Dulles Airport after the inau-
guration as the ban was implemented, 
and many were stuck in limbo. I never 
expected that such an openly bigoted 
policy would be so intentionally exe-
cuted, especially knowing the eco-
nomic and reputational effects. 
Billions of people around the world 
were stunned by this destruction of the 
American ideal as a beacon of freedom. 
My bill then became part of JUDY 
CHU’s very thoughtful NO BAN Act, 
and I am proud to champion it. As 
reckless and thoughtless and cruel as 
the Muslim ban is, this bill is the oppo-
site. It is a thoughtful way to ensure 
that a future President cannot simply 
use racism or religions discrimination 
as a basis for keeping individuals from 
entering the United States. 
We cannot erase the dark stain on 
our country’s history left by Donald 
Trump’s Muslim ban, but we can pre-
vent it from happening again. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, 
there is an ongoing crisis at the border. 
President Biden himself had admitted 
it. Despite his political staff’s best ef-
forts to avoid acknowledging the truth, 
he has admitted it. 
I have served as a doctor in private 
practice for more than 26 years. I have 
served on our Board of Health in Cin-
cinnati. I have served in a combat sup-
port hospital in Iraq, where we pro-
vided outstanding care to thousands of 
detainees. I have seen quite a few crisis 
situations in my life. 
Two weeks ago, I led a group of 
healthcare experts and national secu-
rity experts to the border. What we saw 
was a very difficult situation. It is a 
humanitarian crisis. It is a national se-
curity crisis. But it is also a national 
health security crisis. 
Our group visited HHS’ Donna Proc-
essing Center, which, per COVID guide-
lines, is supposed to house 250 individ-
uals. That day, it had 3,500. Earlier 
that week, it housed 5,000. 
The sites we visited had seen cases of 
lice; scabies; meningitis; chicken pox; 
flu of unknown origin; and, of course, 
COVID–19. What really stuck out was 
that we are only testing symptomatic 
individuals for COVID–19. 
We have learned through this pan-
demic to know better, to know that 
this is not an effective way to stop 
COVID from spreading among the camp 
or fueling surges across our Nation. 
Worse, we are releasing people into 
our Nation without ever having tested 
them for COVID. You don’t have to be 
a doctor to know that is dangerous. 
That is why I offer this motion to re-
commit today and delay this legisla-
tion until every migrant released by 
Customs and Border Patrol produces a 
negative COVID test before boarding a 
U.S. domestic flight. 
If international travelers are re-
quired to show proof of a negative 
COVID–19 test before they can come 
into the United States from a foreign 
country, why are we making an excep-
tion for this surge of migrants? 
American citizens are banned from 
the U.S. without a COVID test, but not 
non-U.S. citizens? 
That is bizarre. 
We risk all the progress we have 
made in this country to contain this 
virus by allowing this vulnerability to 
go unaddressed. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 1333 to re-
quire that migrants released by Cus-
toms and Border Patrol show proof of a 
negative COVID test before they are al-
lowed to board a plane. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include in the RECORD the 
text of the amendment immediately 
prior to the vote on the motion to re-
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I just want to express my incredible 
gratitude, first of all, to Congress-
woman JUDY CHU for her tireless lead-
ership on this issue, and to the Muslim 
community in my district for their 
tireless work and advocacy on this 
issue. 
I remember the day well when Presi-
dent Trump issued this Muslim ban 
right at the beginning of his adminis-
tration. And I remember running out 
to the airport immediately, to the 
international terminal. And shortly 
after I got there, there ended up being 
literally thousands of people who had 
gathered, at the shame on the United 
States of America. The people who 
came that day all had some docu-
mentation. They had visas. At first, 
even people with green cards were 
being held and oppressed. 
Who are we? Who are we as the 
United States of America? 
And I know that, finally, President 
Biden has said: No Muslim ban. 
But we want to make it the law of 
the land so no other President can do 
such a thing that, based on religion, 
people would be banned from the 
United States of America. 
I want to tell you, I take this person-
ally as a Jew, myself. You know, I am 
a first-generation American. Neither of 
my parents was born in this country. 
They were able to emigrate to the 
United States. 
But I also remember the story of our 
history as Jews, when the St. Louis, a 
boat that came to protect people from 
annihilation, was turned away from 
the American shores; was told to go 
back to where it came from; and many 
of those people then perished in the 
Holocaust. 
Who are we? 
This bill is about who we are, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
1333, the NO BAN Act. 
This legislation prohibits discrimina-
tion based on religion and limits the 
executive branch’s ability to issue fu-
ture travel bans. 
I stand here today during Arab Amer-
ican Heritage Month, a time to cele-
brate the diversity of our country and 
remind ourselves that our country is 
stronger for it. 
My district is home to the largest 
Arab-American 
population 
in 
the 
United States. Arab Americans are an 
integral part of Michigan’s identity 
and have made enormous contributions 
to our society. Many of my constitu-
ents fled war and violence to seek a 
safer life;—have done it legally—and 
many of their families still experience 
this suffering every day. 
The former President’s Muslim ban 
kept these families separated. It in-
spired fear. It perpetuated hate. And as 
the Speaker so eloquently stated, na-
tional security experts have made it 
clear that it has made us less safe, not 
more safe. 
I believe that every one of us in this 
Chamber loves our country, and that it 
is a priority for all of us to keep this 
Nation safe. 
b 1345 
I would argue that the actions by the 
previous administration did not. The 
President called for a total ban on all 
Muslims entering this country. We 
must work together against terrorism, 
both foreign and domestic. We need to 
worry about what we witnessed in our 
own Chamber on January 6. 
This bill will not allow people to be 
targeted 
because 
of 
their 
religion 
again. We must work together to re-
store the faith and trust of the inter-
national communities targeted by the 
previous administration. 
Madam Speaker, I urge people to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there is a crisis at 
the border, I mean, the President even 
said so. There is chaos at the border. 
The crisis and the chaos have been cre-
ated by policies of this administration. 
We were down at the border 2 weeks 
ago. Every single Border Patrol agent 
we talked to said the crisis has been 
created by policy changes made by the 
Biden 
administration; 
specifically, 
three changes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2014 
April 21, 2021 
They announced to the world that 
they weren’t going to deport anyone. 
Moratorium on deportation. They an-
nounced to the world they weren’t 
going to finish the wall. And, most im-
portantly, they got rid of the remain in 
Mexico policy. 
And what do we have? 
In March, we had the highest number 
of illegal immigrants coming into our 
Nation since they have been keeping 
records. So it is definitely a crisis, defi-
nitely chaos. 
And what do the Democrats do? What 
do the Democrats do? 
Last month, they passed two bills 
that give amnesty to millions of illegal 
immigrants. You can’t make this stuff 
up. And then, today, they are going to 
pass a piece of legislation that takes 
power away from the Commander in 
Chief, takes power away from the indi-
vidual who was on the ballot and elect-
ed, and gives it to the unelected sec-
retary of state and Secretary of Home-
land Security. 
I mean, you would think, if they were 
going to take power away from the 
President, they would at least give it 
to the Vice President. After all, she is 
the one who has been put in charge of 
this thing. They don’t even do that. 
They don’t even do that. 
The answer is real simple. What we 
should be focused on is reinstating the 
policies that worked. In fact, again, 
when we were down there 2 weeks ago— 
by the way, we invited the Democrats 
to go with us, and they said no. When 
we were down there 2 weeks ago, every 
Border Patrol agent said: Reinstate the 
policies that were working and we 
don’t have the problem, we don’t have 
the crisis. 
But, no, we couldn’t do something 
that common sense. We couldn’t do 
something that simple, that basic. 
They, instead, come with this legisla-
tion. 
Reinstate the policies that work. 
Don’t take power away from the indi-
vidual who was elected by the Amer-
ican people, the Commander in Chief. 
Don’t implement crazy policies. Do the 
things that work. But, no, that is not 
what we are going to do. 
And then after this bill is done, they 
are going to say, oh, by the way, bring 
in the lawyers. Give access to counsel 
to people coming into our country. 
It makes absolutely no sense. 
One of the speakers earlier said: Out 
of many, one. 
That is so true about this country. 
But is it too much to ask to have the 
many who come into this country do it 
legally? 
And have policies in place that make 
sense. Is that too much to ask? 
I think most taxpayers, most Ameri-
cans, think that makes good, common 
sense. 
This bill does not. I hope we vote it 
down. I hope we go back to the policies 
that work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me say that I 
agree with some of what I heard from 
the Republicans. They said there is a 
lot of nonsense spoken on the floor 
today. Indeed, there was. Everything 
they have said about this bill is non-
sense. They have said there is no Mus-
lim ban. Everybody knows there was a 
Muslim ban. The President said he was 
going to impose a Muslim ban, and 
then he did. 
When NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ and I went to 
Kennedy 
airport, 
when 
JAN
SCHA-
KOWSKY went to the airport in Chicago, 
when other people went to the airport, 
what did we find? 
We found Muslims being kept out of 
the country. People with perfectly 
valid visas, perfectly valid green cards, 
people whose relatives were waiting for 
them here because they had perfectly 
valid entry certificates, were being 
kept out of the country, and they 
couldn’t even speak to their lawyers. 
That is the next bill we will be con-
sidering on the floor in a few minutes. 
That is what we found. And that has 
been in effect for a long time. It is un- 
American. It is unconstitutional. It is 
against the ethics of this country. 
As the Speaker said—I think it was 
the Speaker who said it—the motto of 
the country is E Pluribus Unum; from 
many, one. 
This situation, this Muslim ban, de-
nies that. This says E Pluribus—I don’t 
know the Latin from a few, not from 
all. 
Madam Speaker, we must pass this 
bill. More than 400 organizations and 
industry leaders support this bill. They 
include Muslim Advocates, the ACLU, 
Airbnb, Asian Americans Advancing 
Justice, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid So-
ciety. 
Yes, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Soci-
ety. Why? Because the Hebrew Immi-
grant Aid Society remembers its futile 
efforts when Jews were turned away 
from this country to go back to the 
Holocaust; when the St. Louis was 
turned back to go back to the Holo-
caust; when the State Department de-
liberately wouldn’t even use the quota. 
The quota was 150,000, and they kept it 
down to 6,000 because of the anti-Semi-
tism of some officials in the State De-
partment. And the Hebrew Immigrant 
Aid Society—which was formed to aid 
Jewish immigrants, but has long since 
broadened its mission to aid immi-
grants from any country—knows what 
happens and doesn’t want to see it hap-
pen again. That is why they are sup-
porting this bill. 
Other organizations and industry 
leaders that support this bill include 
the Service Employees International 
Union, because so many of their mem-
bers were born abroad; the National 
Immigration Law Center, MoveOn, and 
United We Dream. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
should agree that no President, Repub-
lican or Democrat, should be permitted 
to usurp the powers of the legislative 
branch enshrined in the Constitution. 
The separation of power is fundamental 
to our democratic Republic and must 
be protected. 
For all these reasons, that is why 
passage of H.R. 1333 is so vital. I urge 
my colleagues to vote in support of 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the NO BAN Act. In 
2017, when the Trump administration imple-
mented the first travel ban, nearly a thousand 
college students around Texas were forced to 
make a choice. Either stay in the United 
States to earn a world-class education or visit 
their family abroad and risk being blocked 
from returning to their studies. This is a choice 
that aspiring students should never be forced 
to make. Evidently, these travel bans were not 
in place because of national security. These 
bans were used as a tool to discriminate 
against the Muslim population. Texas is home 
to one of the largest and fastest growing Mus-
lim populations in the country, and these bans 
separated families across many of our dis-
tricts. I applaud the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion for revoking these discriminatory bans. 
But, now is the time for Congress to deliver to 
the American people by ensuring that no fu-
ture administration works to discriminate 
against vulnerable communities. I urge a yes 
vote. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1333, the 
No Ban Act. This legislation would ensure that 
no president, Republican or Democrat, would 
carry the unilateral authority to restrict refu-
gees, asylum seekers, immigrants, and their 
families from entering the United States based 
on their nationality or religion. 
A little more than four years ago, I remem-
ber watching in horror as the Trump Adminis-
tration first instituted the Muslim Ban—barring 
entrance for immigrants at airports throughout 
the country. But I found solace, and inspira-
tion, in the thousands of demonstrations at the 
same airports, including at Dallas-Fort Worth 
International back home in North Texas. It was 
at this moment that Americans saw, for the 
first time, the severe damage that the Trump 
Administration would cause by targeting immi-
grants, refugees, and other underserved and 
vulnerable populations. 
This legislation is a direct result of those 
demonstrations, and of the spirit and advocacy 
of people who believe that the success and 
well-being of our country are built upon the 
contributions of immigrants. It doesn’t just pre-
vent an executive overreach; it sends a mes-
sage to the rest of the world that the United 
States is once again a beacon of freedom and 
hope. This bill reaffirms the belief that immi-
grants, refugees, and asylum seekers should 
be welcome here—free from discrimination. 
And no matter the nativist rhetoric spewing 
from a few on the other side of the aisle, we 
are, and will always be, a country of immi-
grants. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the swift passage of this bill and ask 
the Senate to take up this important legislation 
in a timely manner. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary and a cosponsor, I rise in strong and en-
thusiastic support of H.R. 1333, the ‘‘National 
Origin-Based Anti-Discrimination For Non-Im-
migrants Act, or No BAN Act, which stops ex-
ecutive overreach by preventing the abuse of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2015 
April 21, 2021 
the system pioneered by the 45th President 
with his several abuses of the authority to re-
strict the entry of non-citizens into the United 
States under section 212(f) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (INA). 
Thankfully, it is unnecessary for Congress to 
repeal by legislation the several section 212(f)- 
based executive actions of the 45th Presi-
dent’s, including his original Muslim ban, be-
cause were rescinded by his successor, Presi-
dent Joseph Biden, in the initial days of the 
new Administration. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legislation 
because the NO BAN Act amends section 
212(f) of the INA to place checks and bal-
ances on the President’s authority to tempo-
rarily suspend or restrict the entry of aliens or 
classes of aliens into the United States, when 
it is determined that such individuals ‘‘would 
undermine the security or public safety of the 
United States or the preservation of human 
rights, democratic processes or institutions, or 
international stability.’’ 
Specifically, the bill requires the President to 
find and document that any suspension or re-
striction: 
(1) is based on specific and credible facts; 
(2) is narrowly tailored; 
(3) specifies a duration; and 
(4) includes waivers. 
The NO BAN Act expands the INA’s non-
discrimination provision to prohibit discrimina-
tion based on religion and extends the prohibi-
tion on discrimination beyond the issuance of 
immigrant visas to include the issuance of 
nonimmigrant visas, entry and admission into 
the United States, and the approval or revoca-
tion of any immigration benefit. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the NO 
BAN Act includes an important provision of-
fered last year during the committee markup 
of this legislation, which requires the Adminis-
tration to report to Congress on the impacts— 
positive, negative, and unintended—of any ac-
tion taken by the President pursuant to execu-
tive orders he has or will issue pursuant to 
section 212(f) of the INA. 
I strongly support this legislation, and Presi-
dent Biden’s rescission of his predecessor ex-
ecutive order which added the countries of 
Belarus, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nige-
ria, Sudan and Tanzania to the President’s 
new and offensive Muslim Ban. 
Madam Speaker, as a co-chair of the Con-
gressional Nigerian Caucus, it is important to 
convey to our colleagues that the United 
States cannot afford to hamper diplomatic re-
lations with Nigeria due to its importance in 
the region. 
Nigeria is the largest economy and most 
populous country in Africa with an estimated 
population of more than 190 million, which is 
expected to grow to 400 million by 2050 and 
become the third most populous country in the 
world after China and India. 
The United States is the largest foreign in-
vestor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct in-
vestment concentrated largely in the petro-
leum and mining and wholesale trade sectors. 
At $2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second 
largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and the United States and Nigeria have 
a bilateral trade and investment framework 
agreement. 
In 2017, the two-way trade in goods be-
tween the United States and Nigeria totaled 
over $9 billion. 
Due to many of the residents of these coun-
tries practicing Islam, the 45th President’s ex-
ecutive order was appropriately nicknamed the 
‘‘Muslim Ban’’, and only exemplified his 
xenophobic and prejudiced mindset that the 
American people renounced as unacceptable 
in the 2020 presidential election. 
Tanzania is also an important partner of the 
United States, and through numerous presi-
dential initiatives, the United States has pro-
vided development and other assistance to 
Tanzania for capacity building to address 
health 
and 
education 
issues, 
encourage 
democratic governance promote broad-based 
economic growth, and advance regional and 
domestic security to sustain progress. 
Although Sudan has had some internal 
issues during the last decade, the U.S. was a 
major donor in the March 1989 ‘‘Operation 
Lifeline Sudan,’’ which delivered 100,000 met-
ric tons of food into both government and 
rebel held areas of the Sudan, thus, averting 
widespread starvation. 
The United States established diplomatic re-
lations with Eritrea in 1993, following its inde-
pendence and separation from Ethiopia. 
The United States supported Eritrea’s inde-
pendence and through a concerted, mutual ef-
fort that began in late 2017 and continues 
today, there are vast improvements to the bi-
lateral relationship. 
U.S. interests in Eritrea include supporting 
efforts for greater integration of Eritrea with 
the rest of the Horn of Africa, encouraging Eri-
trea to contribute to regional stability and part-
ner on shared peace and security goals, urg-
ing progress toward a democratic political cul-
ture, addressing human rights issues and pro-
moting economic reform and prosperity. 
A comprehensive and coordinated strategy 
needs to be developed in coordination with the 
United States Congress to ensure that each 
country affected by this law may peacefully 
have its residents enter the United States and 
complete visa and asylum applications. 
We live in a nation of laws, but we also live 
in a nation that seeks to establish and main-
tain diplomatic ties to these important African 
nations and imposing a discriminatory and ar-
bitrary ban would adversely affect foreign rela-
tions with a critical continent for decades to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, in light of the crisis pre-
sented by current COVID–19 pandemic, the 
NO BAN Act contains a provision to ensure 
that the President can use section 212(f) to 
protect the United States from the spread of 
communicable diseases, including COVID–19, 
by suspending the entry of a class of individ-
uals if the President determines their entry 
would undermine the public safety of the 
United States. 
However, to remove any perceived ambi-
guity and avoid the propensity of this president 
to abuse delegated authority, the legislation in-
cludes language to clarify that the term ‘‘public 
safety’’ ‘‘includes efforts necessary to contain 
a communicable disease of public health sig-
nificance.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the NO BAN Act is sup-
ported by a bipartisan coalition of the nation’s 
leading immigrants’ rights organizations, faith- 
based organizations, and civil rights organiza-
tions, including the following: 
American Civil Liberties Union, Church 
World Service, U.S. Conference of Catholic 
Bishops, Muslim Advocates Immigration Hub, 
Asian Americans Advancing Justice Associa-
tion, Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State, Bend the Arc, Center for 
American Progress, The Public Affairs Alliance 
of Iranian Americans, Interfaith Immigration 
Coalition, Human Rights Campaign, Francis-
can Action Network, HIAS, Jewish and Mus-
lims and Allies Acting Together, Religious Ac-
tion Center of Reform Judaism, National 
Council of Jewish Women, National Iranian 
American Organization Action, National Immi-
gration Law Center, International Refugee As-
sistance Project, Friends Committee on Na-
tional Legislation, Engage Action, Airbnb. 
I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 1333 
and send a powerful message that this House 
stands firmly behind America’s well-earned 
and long-established reputation of being the 
most welcoming Nation on earth.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1573. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1573, the Ac-
cess to Counsel Act of 2021, is an impor-
tant bill that will ensure that individ-
uals who seek to lawfully enter the 
United States can contact a family 
member or an adviser if they are held 
for an extended period at a port of 
entry. 
Last September, the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee held a hearing to explore Presi-
dent Trump’s Muslim ban and the 
chaos that unfolded at airports across 
the country when it was first an-
nounced. 
I can personally attest to that chaos, 
based on my experience at JFK Airport 
immediately after the ban was imple-
mented. 
Refugees, 
individuals 
with 
valid visas, and even lawful permanent 
residents were detained for hours and 
were prevented from speaking with at-
torneys. Some even had their phones 
taken away and were unable to call 
their family. 
Although the issue grabbed the head-
lines then, it is, unfortunately, a prob-
lem that occurs daily. Due to the com-
plexity of U.S. immigration law and 
the fact-intensive nature of questions 
regarding admissibility, it is not un-
common for some people to spend 
hours undergoing inspection by U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection, or 
CBP. 
During this time, individuals are 
often prevented from communicating 
with those on the outside. And if the 
individual is lucky enough to have a 
lawyer, CBP will often refuse to speak 
to them, even if they can provide crit-
ical information or correct the legal 
error. Moreover, serious consequences 
can result from being refused admis-
sion. 
Some have argued that this bill will 
require CBP to expend significant re-
sources, but I believe they fundamen-
tally misunderstand the substance of 
the bill. To be clear, H.R. 1573 does not 
provide a right to counsel, nor does it 
impose any obligation on the Federal 
Government to build any additional 
space to accommodate counsel or hire 
new staff, nor to pay for counsel. 
The bill simply ensures that no one 
who presents themselves at a port of 
entry with valid travel documents is 
completely cut off from the world dur-
ing the inspection process. It allows 
those 
seeking 
admission, 
including 
U.S. citizens, to communicate with 
counsel and other parties if they are 
subjected to secondary inspection that 
lasts longer than 1 hour. The bill spe-
cifically contemplates that this could 
be accomplished telephonically. 
It is absurd to claim that providing 
these individuals with the opportunity 
to call their families or an attorney 
and potentially receive their assistance 
during the inspection process will con-
sume significant CBP resources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2017 
April 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ex-
tend a special thanks to my colleague, 
Representative JAYAPAL, for her lead-
ership on this issue and for cham-
pioning this bill. I encourage my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), the 
ranking member on the Immigration 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
we are way beyond any question of 
whether we face a border crisis. The 
question now is whether we have a bor-
der at all. 
When I put that very question di-
rectly to the president of the Border 
Patrol, his answer was an emphatic: 
No, we do not. 
By abandoning the border wall, re-
scinding the remain in Mexico policy, 
and obstructing enforcement of court- 
ordered deportations, President Biden 
has produced a mass illegal migration 
of historic proportions, preying most 
tragically on young children and mak-
ing the Mexican crime cartels billions 
of dollars. 
The only border security measure he 
hasn’t pulled down is the ability of the 
CBP to stop illicit activity at our offi-
cial ports of entry, where large vol-
umes of narcotics and other contra-
band must pass. 
Judiciary Republicans recently vis-
ited our facility at Hidalgo crossing, 
where thousands of cars and trucks 
passing through the port of entry must 
be inspected daily to protect our coun-
try from high-volume cartel smug-
gling. Our officers are experts at spot-
ting suspicious traffic hidden among 
the high volume of legal crossings 
without unduly delaying honest com-
merce and passage. 
Now, to do this, they wave the sus-
picious traffic to secondary inspec-
tions, where they can locate and stop 
contraband that is often ingeniously 
hidden. 
b 1400 
Now, this has been a tremendous in-
convenience to the cartels. We saw mil-
lions of dollars of methamphetamines 
and other deadly drugs, as well as in-
fected fruits and vegetables heading to 
American markets, recently seized at 
these secondary inspections. 
But H.R. 1573 would grind legitimate 
trade and travel to a halt by providing 
that anyone referred to secondary in-
spection can, within an hour, consult 
with an attorney and call other third 
parties. Now, there are more than 17 
million 
secondary 
inspections 
con-
ducted each year at our 328 ports of 
entry. 
Can you imagine the effect of this 
bill? 
It is not limited to attorneys. A 
smuggler pulled into secondary inspec-
tion could warn confederates behind 
him that their hiding places have been 
discovered, turn back. 
The officers told me they are already 
overwhelmed, using antiquated facili-
ties, and suffering manpower short-
ages. This bill gives the CBP the Hob-
son’s choice of curtailing inspections 
or routinely backing up traffic for 
hours on end. 
The inspection itself is not a crimi-
nal process. It is a screening process to 
assure that only legal products enter 
our country. Only when it becomes a 
criminal matter is there a right to 
counsel. 
Now, if this isn’t actually written by 
the crime cartels, it is certainly en-
tirely in their interest and service. It 
speaks volumes about the attitude of 
the Democrats on the security of our 
border, the safety of our citizens, and 
the sovereignty of our Nation. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), who is 
the chairwoman of the Immigration 
and Citizenship Subcommittee. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
urge adoption of this bill that allows 
individuals who have obviously valid 
travel documents to contact a member 
of their family or counsel if they are 
held for an extended period of time at 
a U.S. port of entry. 
It has nothing to do with the inspec-
tion of contraband. It has nothing to do 
with providing a lawyer at government 
expense. That is prohibited. It has 
nothing to do with delaying the inspec-
tion. It is only if it is practical for the 
CBP to allow this to occur. 
The immigration laws are very com-
plex and fact-intensive, and for some 
people who are in secondary inspection 
for hours, providing a piece of informa-
tion to the CBP can clear things up. 
Madam Speaker, I will give you an 
example of a researcher coming in with 
a valid visa and the CBP wonders about 
that research: Is it true? Being able to 
communicate with the president of the 
university where the student is head-
ing to can assure the CBP about the re-
search and would clear the matter up. 
This bill does nothing to alter the ex-
isting authority of the CBP to alter, to 
deny entry, or to issue an expedited re-
moval order. It just allows individuals 
to communicate with their American 
family, with their employer, and with 
their counsel to help provide informa-
tion. There are many red herrings that 
have been offered about this bill, but it 
is really about expediting a process 
that is impeded, oftentimes because of 
lack of information. These are individ-
uals who are coming legally. It does 
not apply to people who are coming be-
tween ports of entry. 
The 
lack 
of 
communication 
can 
cause harm to American families. 
Somebody who is coming to their 
American fiancee can be turned away. 
Somebody who is coming to work for 
an employer who needs their expertise 
could be turned away. Somebody who 
is 
coming 
to 
continue 
their 
groundbreaking medical research could 
erroneously be turned away. 
It is important that information be 
made available to the CBP, and the 
way to do that is to make sure that in-
dividuals who are lawfully attempting 
to enter the United States with an ap-
parently valid visa at a port of entry 
who has been held for secondary in-
spection have an opportunity to com-
municate with their American family 
or with their American boss or even a 
lawyer to get information that the 
CBP can then consider, and if they are 
not persuaded it is valid, they can still 
turn that individual around. 
I think that the opposition is a bit 
overwrought. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from California 
such time as she may consume. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I ac-
tually am surprised by some of the 
things in the rhetoric that have been 
offered in opposition to what is really 
just a commonsense, modest measure 
that will allow for communication for 
people who have legal visas who have 
been held in secondary inspection, so 
the confusion can be cleared up. It is 
important, not just to the people try-
ing to enter, but it is important to 
Americans who are waiting for them— 
their families, their employers, and 
their teachers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge approval of 
this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, 185 years ago today 
in San Jacinto, Texas, the great State 
of Texas won its independence from 
Mexico. 
General Sam Houston launched a sur-
prise attack against Santa Anna, rout-
ed their forces, and then ultimately 
was able to negotiate with Santa Anna 
for his freedom the treaty that resulted 
in the founding of the Republic of 
Texas. 
As a proud Texan, I am sitting here 
185 years later recognizing that my 
State, the State that I am proud to 
represent, is under siege. It is under 
constant siege on a daily basis by dan-
gerous cartels, but worse than being 
under siege by dangerous cartels, it is 
under siege by a Democrat President 
who refuses to do his constitutional 
duty to secure the border of the United 
States. 
That is the fact, that this President, 
obligated under the Constitution, lit-
erally refuses to carry out and exercise 
his constitutional duty to defend our 
borders—our borders in Texas—where 
our 
communities 
are 
under 
siege, 
where our schools are overrun, where 
our hospitals are being inundated, 
where our ranchers are having people 
cross them, and where dangerous nar-
cotics like fentanyl are pouring into 
our communities. 
This is what is happening to my 
State of Texas on this, the 185th anni-
versary of the battle at San Jacinto. 
One has to wonder whether the agree-
ment that Texas made when entering

this Union remains worth it when the 
State of Texas is under siege by an ad-
ministration that refuses to defend our 
border. 
That is a question that we Texans are 
continuing to wrestle with, because it 
is the duty of this President and the 
duty of the Federal Government to se-
cure the borders. 
I look at Texans who have lost loved 
ones at the hands of people here ille-
gally. I look at families who have fami-
lies destroyed by fentanyl and dan-
gerous narcotics. And I look at traf-
ficking of human beings into the sex 
trade in the State of Texas where stash 
houses are being run by cartels. Then I 
watch as my Democratic colleagues 
want to put up every roadblock to se-
curity and launch every single way 
possible to prop up cartels, prop up the 
ability of our border to be exploited, 
and refuse to actually do the job nec-
essary to secure the border. 
It is incumbent upon this body to 
speak with one voice that we are going 
to defend the borders of the United 
States and do our duty under the Con-
stitution while States are feeling the 
brunt every single day in very real 
terms. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCGOVERN). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities 
toward the President. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 1 minute. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to have a lot 
more to say about this bill a little 
later, but I have to respond to one 
point that the gentleman just made. 
He said he was considering whether 
the agreement to enter the Union was 
valid or was worth it. He is not the 
first to consider that. John Calhoun 
considered that. Others considered it, 
and they tried it. The result was a civil 
war. So I certainly hope that no one is 
thinking of that again. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because I feel that too many on 
the left are comfortable with lies and 
half-truths. Let me tell you one thing, 
Mr. Speaker: I am sick of it, my con-
stituents are sick of it, and the Amer-
ican people are sick of it. 
My colleagues just said that Presi-
dent Trump instituted a Muslim ban. If 
my colleagues had read executive order 
13769, instead of their liberal talking 
points, they would know that that is 
simply not true. President Trump’s ban 
impacted seven specific countries. My 
colleagues’ statements are patently 
false and prohibitively misleading. 
The crisis at our southern border rep-
resents a serious risk to our national 
security of the United States and the 
sanctity of the rule of law. 
Reports from law enforcement offi-
cers fighting to stem the overwhelming 
tide of illegal immigration into our 
country emphasizes the lack of re-
sources and misapplication of funds by 
the Federal Government. Yet today, we 
are being asked to vote on a bill that 
would do nothing to fix the weaknesses 
at 
our 
border 
but 
instead 
would 
misallocate resources away from our 
border security agents. 
This little bill would spend $825 mil-
lion to provide taxpayer-funded legal 
assistance to individuals crossing our 
border because my colleagues on the 
left believe the best way to fix any 
problem is just to send in more law-
yers. 
This legislation would significantly 
hamper law enforcement’s ability to ef-
fectively screen potentially dangerous 
individuals who have been flagged by 
other agencies for advanced screening 
due to their criminal record or status 
as a person of interest for national se-
curity purposes. 
We should be empowering law en-
forcement, not reining in their effec-
tiveness. Screening passengers who 
enter our country is a normal part of 
securing the U.S. ports of entry and is 
a uniform expectation for all who want 
to enter the United States. Granting a 
lawyer to anyone who warrants a sec-
ondary screening is like demanding a 
lawyer every time your bag is checked 
going through TSA. 
This bill does nothing to enhance our 
border security, and, furthermore, it 
hampers their ability to carry out 
their mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1573. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Ms. JAYAPAL), who is the spon-
sor of the bill. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman so much for his tremen-
dous leadership on helping to bring this 
bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
bill, the Access to Counsel Act. 
It is the Access to Counsel Act. I 
don’t know if my friends on the other 
side have heard that. I am not sure how 
access to counsel helps empower car-
tels. I am not sure if my colleagues on 
the other side have read the bill. This 
does not fund counsel, and it actually 
doesn’t give a right to counsel. We 
could debate that in another bill. This 
gives access to counsel. 
It brings us one step closer to uphold-
ing our country’s principles of due 
process and fairness by ensuring that 
individuals with lawful status have the 
right to call a lawyer and receive as-
sistance if they are detained at ports of 
entry or in airports. 
So why did this bill come about? 
The Access to Counsel Act was the 
very first bill I introduced as a Member 
of Congress in 2017 in response to Presi-
dent Donald Trump’s Muslim ban. On 
the day that Donald Trump announced 
that ban, I rushed to my local airport 
in Seattle. What I encountered and 
what we saw at airports across the Na-
tion was a sham of our democracy. 
People from seven Muslim-majority 
countries—all with legal access to be in 
the 
United 
States—suddenly 
found 
themselves held for upwards of 30 
hours, deported, and in some cases 
pressured to sign papers giving up their 
legal status without even the ability to 
call an attorney or a family member. 
I then reintroduced, again, the Ac-
cess to Counsel Act in my second term, 
in January of 2020, after Customs and 
Border Protection targeted Iranian 
Americans at ports of entry. As many 
as 200 Iranian Americans were held in 
secondary screening in Blaine, Wash-
ington. 
Negah Hekmati and her two children 
were detained for nearly 6 hours de-
spite being U.S. citizens and despite 
having preclearance for expedited proc-
essing at the border that is specifically 
for approved, low-risk travelers. 
b 1415 
She recalls her small children beg-
ging her not to speak Farsi in fear of 
being detained. At such a young age, 
her children, U.S. citizens, already rec-
ognized that they were being profiled 
and unjustly held because of their her-
itage. 
Of course, when we raised this in the 
moment, Border Patrol said: That is 
not happening. We can’t do that. We 
wouldn’t do that. We are not doing 
that. 
Well, it took over a year and suing 
the government in order to access doc-
uments from Customs and Border Pro-
tection for us to find out that the total 
number of people held was 227 people. 
Half of those people were U.S. citizens 
and legal permanent residents, half of 
the 227. The rest of them had legal pa-
perwork to come into the country. 
So, why were they held? They were 
held because of their Iranian heritage 
or ties to the Middle East. Later, we 
also found out that there was no at-
tempt from Border Patrol to figure out 
why they were there, whether they 
should be there, or to even comply with 
the law that says that your country of 
origin cannot be the sole purpose that 
you are held. 
If Republicans want to talk about 
wasting Border Patrol resources, let’s 
talk about the fact that 227 people, half 
of whom were U.S. citizens and legal 
permanent residents and the rest with 
valid visas, were held in a Border Pa-
trol station in Blaine, Washington, for 
almost 12 hours and unable to leave. 
That is called detention. 
You have now turned the Border Pa-
trol stations into detention facilities. 
That is not what we are supposed to do. 
Why is it so difficult to say: Yes, a 
phone call is permissible. 
That is what this bill is trying to do. 
Throughout the last administration, 
we saw dozens of Iranian students with 
valid visas having their visas revoked 
or being deported upon arrival to the 
United States simply because of their 
country of origin. The Access to Coun-
sel Act would ensure that people who 
have already been vetted and granted 
lawful status have a meaningful oppor-
tunity to call an attorney, have a

meaningful opportunity to call a rel-
ative or other interested party, like a 
Member of Congress, when they get 
held for more than an hour in sec-
ondary inspection. 
This is a commonsense measure, Mr. 
Speaker, to make sure that our Nation 
treats those who are arriving to our 
country, whether it is green card hold-
ers who have made their home here in 
the United States; visa holders work-
ing, studying, or traveling to the 
United States; or U.S. citizens who 
happen to have been identified with a 
different country of origin for some 
reason, let’s make sure we treat every-
body with dignity and respect. 
I am so proud to be passing the Ac-
cess to Counsel Act today, alongside 
the No BAN Act, to put an end to some 
of the most cruel and discriminatory 
policies adopted by the previous ad-
ministration and to make sure that 
they never happen again. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires 
individuals entering our country at 
ports of entry, tens of millions of them, 
who are referred for secondary inspec-
tion to get a lawyer. Yet, Democrats 
tell us this is not going to cost the tax-
payers anything. I mean, this is some 
kind of miracle. 
You have a mandate for tens of mil-
lions of people coming into our coun-
try, and it is not going to cost Ameri-
cans any money? I have never seen a 
government mandate that didn’t cost 
something. This is amazing. 
I remember my days in the State leg-
islature. Local governments were con-
cerned about unfunded mandates from 
the State. This may be the biggest 
mandate we have ever seen. 
But somehow, our agents, who are 
busting their tails working night and 
day right now with this crisis on the 
border, it is not going to cost them 
anything in time and effort. 
I think the American taxpayers are 
smarter than that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
When I hear that, oh, this bill simply 
is just trying to give a phone call, well, 
then why didn’t it say that? Why didn’t 
it say that in the bill? It didn’t say 
that. It talks about access to an attor-
ney. I am an attorney. I did court-ap-
pointed attorney work. I did it all the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, this may not give 
someone a court-appointed attorney, 
but what it does is, you open it up. If 
Democrats don’t think that consumes 
resources, then I just wonder if Demo-
crats have ever been to a port of entry 
and watched people coming through 
and seen the secondary inspection 
process. 
This is going to bog down your ports 
of entry, and it is going to lead to liti-
gation. This is a trial lawyer’s blessing, 
a trial lawyer’s dream, I can tell you 
that, because that is what is going to 
happen. There are going to be mistakes 
made, and even if there aren’t mistakes 
made, there are going to be lawsuits. 
This is not designed to facilitate bor-
der ingress and egress. This is not de-
signed to help commercial traffic. This 
is going to bog down our system. 
While that is going on, Democrats 
say this is not going to be a problem. It 
will redirect and redeploy Border Pa-
trol agents and Customs agents to deal 
with this. That means it is going to 
really slow things down, and everyone 
knows what that means. That means 
that all the people who are coming are 
going to have an even wider open field. 
In February, over 101,000 aliens were 
encountered. In March, over 172,000 
aliens were encountered at the border. 
The number is going up. It is not going 
down. It is going up. Do you know why? 
Because the policies of this administra-
tion draw people in. They have done 
absolutely nothing to slow this down. 
Madam Speaker, do you know what 
the number one most important thing 
would be? How about the President of 
the United States of America stand up 
and say: No. We will send you back. 
Our border is closed. If you want to 
come in, come in legally through the 
ports of entry. 
How about doing that? Well, he has 
not done that. That is why you see peo-
ple showing up with Biden campaign T- 
shirts on the border. That is why the 
Mexican President said this is Biden’s 
border crisis. That is why the El Sal-
vador President has expressed the 
same. And that is what Border Patrol 
agents also understand. 
Ranchers and people in my district 
and those who live on the border, that 
is why they will say: This is Biden’s 
problem. He created it. He inherited a 
solution and created a crisis. 
The person who he has tapped to lead 
the efforts to address this surge at the 
border has been all over the place, just 
hasn’t been at the border. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to gen-
tleman from Arizona. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, this in-
dividual has not been to the border 
once, but the solutions are not a mys-
tery. 
President Biden has to stand up and 
make a statement: You have to con-
tinue construction of the wall; rein-
state the MPP program; reinstate the 
12 international agreements that were 
in place that were slowing this down. 
That would have stopped it. The last 
thing is, move your asylum courts 
down to the border to deal with current 
asylum cases. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from New York 
for his leadership. 
I thank the gentlewoman from the 
State of Washington for her grand and 
superb and astute leadership in under-
standing the Bill of Rights. 
I have watched this debate, and I 
have seen people go to the microphone 
and talk about ‘‘on the left.’’ I didn’t 
know the Constitution was on the left 
or the right. I thought the Constitution 
was a document that our Founding Fa-
thers started with the language ‘‘to 
form a more perfect Union.’’ And in the 
Bill of Rights, citizens or noncitizens 
can have access to due process just be-
cause of the basic foundation of this 
Nation. 
For a moment, I am going to pause, 
but I rise to support enthusiastically 
the Access to Counsel Act, H.R. 1573. 
But let me pause, as a resident and cit-
izen of a border State. 
Oh, how interesting it is, the inter-
pretation of those one-time visitors. 
What about those of us who have been 
at the border over and over again? 
What about those of us who stood in 
the dark of night and saw a 2-year-old 
or a baby come off the wall. 
No, that was not what we wanted. 
But people fleeing persecution have al-
ways sought to come to the place 
where the Statue of Liberty stands in 
the harbor. As far as I know, she is not 
gone. There is an Office of Refugee Re-
settlement. We have been a refuge for 
refugees. 
Madam Speaker, I can tell you that, 
in the last 4 years, I saw scenes that I 
had never seen in my life. Do I need to 
remind Republicans of the children 
who died in our custody? No, I don’t 
blame those Border Patrol or others 
there, my neighbors. But I blame the 
policies of the previous administration 
that did not care and simply left them 
to their own devices, which was a 
crowded, unsanitized place with metal-
lic blankets and people not able to 
move because their idea was: Move 
them out. Make it so horrible, short of 
losing their lives, they will leave. 
Then, what about the MPP program? 
I went to Mexico and saw desperate 
people in the streets. They had no 
place to live. They were being taken 
advantage of. I don’t fault Mexico that, 
in essence, made an agreement. Maybe 
they were intimidated by the last ad-
ministration and didn’t know what else 
to do. But the MPP program subjected 
people to very dangerous conditions. 
So, besides the Biden administra-
tion’s policy of a closed border, sending 
people back who are single adults, but 
for the ports of entry, obviously; and, 
as well, those families, still giving 
them the opportunity to apply for asy-
lum, which was literally cut off—do-
mestic abuse persons couldn’t apply for 
asylum under the last administration— 
fleeing bloodshed. 
I would rather stand with President 
Biden and Vice President Harris, who 
are strategically trying to work on be-
half of the American people, but they 
have not left their compassion and hu-
manity at the front door of the White 
House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2020 
April 21, 2021 
This legislation is absolutely in com-
pliance with the Constitution because 
what it says is that you have access to 
counsel. We don’t pay for it. You have 
legal entry documents, and it is only 
when you are in secondary detention 
that this takes place so that little Ali, 
who I mentioned earlier on the floor, 
coming from Egypt with the appro-
priate documents, would have been 
able to call his father or his uncle, who 
was here in Houston, Texas. 
Is that not simple humanity? Is that 
simple kindness? Is that recognizing 
the dignity of all people? 
What about this New York City de-
sign gallery owner detained at an air-
port because of this ridiculous process? 
Of course, that was in 2017, the last ad-
ministration, Juan Garcia Mosqueda, 
founder of the New York art-and-design 
gallery called Chamber and a decade- 
long legal permanent resident. I don’t 
know how he got detained at the John 
F. Kennedy International Airport. Not 
only did he get detained, but he was 
shipped back to his native Argentina 
with no opportunity to talk to anyone 
ahead of his gallery art show that very 
day. 
In an open letter titled ‘‘The Visible 
Wall,’’ released by Mosqueda, he called 
the experience dehumanizing and de-
grading. He had his documents and de-
tailed his 36-hour-long detainment, 
questioning, and return to Buenos 
Aires. 
We already know I was getting ready 
to speak in the last debate on the No 
BAN Act. Nigeria was added to the list. 
I co-chair the Nigerian Caucus. There 
are doctors, lawyers, teachers, and bus-
inesspersons who have served from Ni-
geria in this Nation. 
I believe this is a right-thinking bill, 
the Access to Counsel Act of 2021. I rise 
to support this legislation, and I op-
pose all of those who think that the 
Constitution no longer exists. Support 
the bill, H.R. 1573. 
b 1430 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
recently visited the border in my home 
State of Texas. The crisis there is as-
tounding, as thousands of illegal immi-
grants enter the country on a daily 
basis. The Biden administration has 
been silent and in denial of any crisis, 
as we have seen record numbers of ap-
prehensions, drug crossings into the 
U.S., and no answer for the humani-
tarian crisis of 20,000 unaccompanied 
minors. 
President 
Biden 
appointed 
Vice 
President Harris as his immigration 
czar, and we have seen her travel all 
around the country, but not to the bor-
der. We have got a border czar who has 
not even been to the border. 
Democrat leadership has been silent, 
not once questioning her absence from 
this humanitarian crisis. Instead, this 
week, they bring us more bad legisla-
tion. Today, we are debating spending 
nearly a billion dollars to give access 
to counsel to foreign citizens when 
they are not even subject to a criminal 
investigation. That is a right we do not 
even afford our own citizens. 
My Republican colleagues and I con-
tinue to expose the crisis on the bor-
der, having seen firsthand the horrific 
situation. Yet the Democrats’ solution 
is to hire attorneys, forcing Border Pa-
trol to hire new personnel and con-
struct new space to comply with this 
misguided legislation, which does noth-
ing to address the hundreds of thou-
sands of people surging our borders at 
record numbers, the girls and the boys 
who are being sexually assaulted and 
exploited, and the thousands of pounds 
of illegal drugs and weapons pouring 
into our country. 
If the Vice President actually went 
down there, agents could show her the 
miles of unprotected border they have 
been pulled off of to instead act as 
babysitters. She might be able to un-
derstand that the policies put in place 
under the previous administration ac-
tually worked. 
We should be focused on securing our 
border and letting our agents do their 
jobs. The lack of compassion, the lack 
of humanity that we have seen under 
the Biden administration is appalling. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
said we should treat everyone with dig-
nity and respect. 
Have you seen the conditions that 
are down at the border right now? 
It is the exact opposite of dignity and 
respect. And these words mean nothing 
if we refuse to follow them with action. 
The legislation in front of us does 
nothing to stop the Biden border crisis, 
and it is just another attempt to 
prioritize the interests of aliens over 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to start with responding to a 
complete misrepresentation of what 
this bill does. We have heard our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
say that this bill requires that counsel 
be appointed to individuals, and they 
have even gone so far as to assign a 
number to it, $800 million. 
That simply is not true. At first, I 
thought maybe it was an honest mis-
take, but it is being repeated. So now I 
know it is an affirmative misrepresen-
tation. 
What the bill does—and I invite my 
colleagues to look at the language of 
the bill. Go to page 3, line 17. A covered 
individual has a meaningful oppor-
tunity to consult with counsel and an 
interested party; they are required to 
provide a meaningful opportunity to 
consult with counsel. 
There is no requirement in the bill 
that counsel be provided or paid for. So 
that claim is just not true. No matter 
how many times it gets repeated by 
our Republican colleagues, they are 
making it up. It is not in the bill. 
So I rise in strong support of the H.R. 
1573, the Access to Counsel Act. 
Our legal system rests on the prin-
ciple that every person is entitled to 
due process and a meaningful oppor-
tunity to be heard. The ability to con-
sult with legal counsel is critical to 
both of these principles. For some, it is 
a matter of life and death. In the con-
text of immigration, access to counsel 
can mean the difference between some-
one fleeing persecution, being able to 
remain safely in the United States, or 
detained or deported back to a war 
zone. 
These are decisions that are often 
made away from courts. For example, 
Customs and Border Protection have 
the power to remove individuals from 
the United States without a hearing, 
based on statements made during an 
initial screening. Nothing in this bill 
changes that. 
Questioning by Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement can lead to arrest, 
detention, initiation of removal pro-
ceedings, and removal, all done with-
out access to counsel. The time, ex-
pense, and other resources associated 
with many immigration-related deten-
tions could be avoided entirely if coun-
sel were able to sit in during ques-
tioning. 
H.R. 1573 confirms that the right to 
access counsel attaches at the time of 
holding or detention and requires CBP 
or ICE to provide people detained and 
questioned with the ability to make a 
call and notify an attorney of their de-
tention. 
H.R. 1573 does not force CBP or ICE 
to identify and assign lawyers to indi-
viduals subject to inspection. It doesn’t 
require them to provide funds to obtain 
lawyers and support through the in-
spection process, nor does it create any 
obligation for the government to pay 
for counsel. 
This legislation simply opens the 
door to meaningful access to counsel 
for those who have an attorney ready 
to assist, and it ensures that people 
subjected to prolonged inspection are 
able to communicate with and receive 
assistance from counsel or other indi-
viduals who can facilitate the inspec-
tion process. 
This is a commonsense proposal that 
really does ensure that the system will 
work more efficiently, particularly for 
U.S. citizens. 
I want to applaud the sponsor of this 
bill, Congresswoman JAYAPAL, for her 
extraordinary leadership. I thank the 
chairman of our committee for bring-
ing this to the committee and now to 
the floor. This is something that every-
one should support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1573. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this cost estimate on H.R. 1573 
from the Congressional Budget Office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2021 
April 21, 2021 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST 
ESTIMATE, APRIL 15, 2021 
H.R. 1573 would require the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to allow individ-
uals subject to secondary immigration in-
spection at U.S. ports of entry to consult 
with an attorney, accredited immigration of-
ficial, family member, or immigration spon-
sor during the inspection. The bill also would 
require DHS to allow the counsel or inter-
ested party to appear in person at the inspec-
tion site to the greatest extent practicable. 
(A secondary immigration inspection is con-
ducted by customs officers if individuals en-
tering the United States do not have the re-
quired documents for entry or if their infor-
mation cannot be initially verified.) 
Approximately 
10.2 
million 
individuals 
were referred to secondary inspection at the 
United States’ 328 ports of entry in 2019. 
Using information provided by Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP), CBO expects that 
roughly 8 percent of referrals would request 
access to counsel each year. Immigration at 
ports of entry has declined significantly in 
fiscal years 2020 and 2021 because of the 
coronavirus pandemic; CBO assumes refer-
rals would return to pre-pandemic levels be-
ginning in mid–2022. 
CBO estimates that CBP would need two 
new full-time officers on average at each 
port of entry to provide security and trans-
portation services for individuals requesting 
access to counsel. (The number of CBP offi-
cers stationed at each port of entry ranges 
from several individuals to up to several 
thousands, and the number of additional offi-
cers needed at each port under the bill would 
vary by the size of the port.) CBO estimates 
that salaries, benefits, and overtime for the 
additional staff would cost about $700 million 
over the 2021–2026 period; such spending 
would be subject to the availability of appro-
priated funds. 
Additionally, using information provided 
by the agency, CBO expects that 222 ports of 
entry (nearly two-thirds of all ports) would 
need additional space or other upgrades to 
accommodate the bill’s requirement to allow 
counsel to appear in person at inspection 
sites. Using that same information and his-
torical patterns of construction costs, CBO 
estimates the total cost for construction and 
operation of the additional space would total 
$123 million over the 2021–2026 period. 
Specifically, CBO estimates that construc-
tion costs at 113 land facilities would total 
$62 million over the 2021–2026 period, with $10 
million spent in subsequent years. CBO esti-
mates the cost of renting additional space at 
109 airport facilities would total $44 million 
over the 2021–2026 period. In addition, CBO 
estimates the cost of initial setup, recurring 
maintenance, and other operational expenses 
associated with the additional space would 
total $17 million over the 2021–2026 period. 
All construction and operational costs would 
be subject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The costs of the legislation, detailed in 
Table 1, fall within budget function 750 (ad-
ministration of justice). 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman said it wasn’t going to cost 
anything. 
This is straight from the Congres-
sional Budget Office: $825 million over 
the next 5 years, this is going to cost. 
This is based on Customs and Border 
Protection telling the CBO what costs 
they are going to incur. 
So right there it is. He can say it is 
not there, but the CBO says it is. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, our Na-
tion is in a crisis. We are facing a real 
crisis at our southern border. As I 
speak, hundreds of migrants are cross-
ing into the United States right now 
because the Biden administration has 
made it clear to the world that the bor-
der is open and the rule of law will not 
be upheld. 
Now, instead of working on solutions 
to address the ongoing border crisis, 
the majority has brought forward legis-
lation that would cripple our Nation’s 
screening process for individuals enter-
ing at U.S. ports of entry. 
Currently, a right to counsel does 
exist, but it only occurs once a screen-
ing turns from questions on the admis-
sibility of people or goods to a custo-
dial interrogation relating to a crimi-
nal offense. 
More efficient, says my colleague 
from the other side. 
This bill would place a significant 
burden on the men and women of the 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
who, prior to the pandemic, processed 
over 1 million people daily at various 
ports of entry. The CBP regularly con-
ducts over 17 million secondary inspec-
tions each year. That is not more effi-
cient with this legislation. 
This legislation would severely limit 
the CBP’s ability to ensure thorough 
inspections of all travelers, not only 
those referred to secondary inspection, 
creating unnecessary delays and sig-
nificant impacts on daily operations. 
This bill misuses taxpayer dollars, 
puts the interests of foreign citizens 
above the interests of American citi-
zens. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, we must establish an America-first 
immigration 
policy. 
However, 
the 
Democrats are doing the opposite, with 
illegal aliens first, foreign nations 
first, and future Democrat voters first. 
Law-abiding 
American 
citizens 
are 
clearly last on the list of priorities, if 
they even make the list at all. 
They are giving illegal aliens free 
healthcare, free education, free social 
services, free transportation, and even 
free lodging. Today, it is more of the 
same, with the continued effort to en-
able and facilitate illegal entry into 
our country. Now they want to provide 
attorneys for illegal aliens and further 
restrict our ability to refuse entry to 
those who wish us harm. Come one, 
come all. 
Is it confusion and incompetence on 
the part of Democrats? 
Do they not know the threat to our 
country? Do they not understand? 
Or is it worse and they know exactly 
what they are doing and they don’t 
care about the consequences? 
Why else would they let organized 
crime profit off the suffering of those 
trying to illegally cross our border? 
Why else would they stop building 
the Trump wall? 
Why else would they reinstate catch- 
and-release and offer amnesty to ille-
gal aliens? 
Why else would they stop MPP and 
Title 42 restrictions? 
The Democrats are destroying our 
country, and you need to look no fur-
ther than our own border. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). The gentleman from New 
York has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the Access to 
Counsel Act. 
Thousands of immigrants lawfully 
come to our country, come through our 
ports of entry, daily. They come in 
order to reunite with families, in order 
to receive lifesaving medical help, in 
order 
to 
pursue 
their 
educational 
dreams. They come because they are 
allowed to come, and they come for 
really good purposes. 
When they arrive, all too often they 
are subjected to grueling inspections 
and relentless questioning by our Cus-
toms and Border Patrol agents, and 
often they have no help to turn to. 
H.R. 1573 will ensure that these indi-
viduals can communicate with a family 
member, an attorney, or other party 
who can help them navigate what is 
going on at the port of entry if they are 
held over an hour. 
This is important. We are not saying 
that there shouldn’t be any inspections 
whatsoever, that there shouldn’t be 
any questioning. But sometimes people 
have been held up to 30 hours without 
any access to help. It is not right. 
This is critical to ensuring that im-
migrants are treated fairly and with 
dignity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Access to 
Counsel Act and to support due process 
for all. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, there is 
a humanitarian crisis on our southern 
border. Every day, more migrants 
surge towards the border and over-
whelm the dedicated men and women 
of Customs and Border Protection. 
CBP is facing the most dramatic in-
crease in detentions and illegal cross-
ings in nearly 15 years, with no end in 
sight and no plan to address the situa-
tion articulated and caused by the 
Biden administration. 
Mr. Biden revoked the remain in 
Mexico policy and the safe third coun-
try agreements with Guatemala, Hon-
duras, and El Salvador. He stopped 
building the wall. He tapped Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS to coordi-
nate the response to this humanitarian 
crisis almost a month ago. She still

hasn’t visited the border, but she has 
had time to stop at a Chicago bakery 
and grab a slice of cake for her plane 
ride home. 
The Vice President’s message to the 
American communities being overrun 
with illegal immigrants is, apparently, 
‘‘let them eat cake,’’ while the Presi-
dent rolls out the welcome mat to ille-
gal immigrants pouring over our bor-
der. 
My colleagues across the aisle want 
to fund lawyers for illegal immigrants 
and defund the police. They don’t care 
if the American people are protected, 
but they want to make sure their 
friends in the local bar association get 
paid to represent criminals flooding 
into our country. 
Democrats don’t have time to fix our 
broken immigration system, but they 
have time to visit Minnesota and incite 
riots. 
b 1445 
During the current crisis, immigra-
tion backlogs have gotten so extreme 
that illegal migrants are being housed 
in convention centers and hotels across 
the country. My liberal colleagues 
should try addressing the rising home-
less problem with Americans rather 
than placing illegal immigrants in ho-
tels. 
Just 2 weeks ago, the CBP announced 
the arrest of two men on the FBI’s ter-
rorism watch list as they tried to cross 
the southern border. If this legislation 
was enacted, Americans would have 
paid for their lawyers to help these ter-
rorists stay in our country. 
This is a dangerous precedent that 
prevents our existing border security 
apparatus from working properly. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 91⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
know it seems compassionate to those 
who support this bill to say we want to 
give this young child whose parents 
sent them up by themselves, give them 
a lawyer, help them out. 
But the consequences for those of us 
that have spent a lot of time on the 
border are very clear. It means, if you 
make this law, that the representatives 
of the drug cartels, which are often 
gang members, they can tell the par-
ents, Look, I know it is a tough deci-
sion whether to send your child alone, 
this little 3-, 5-, 8-year-old child up by 
themselves, but the good news is that 
there are people in Congress that have 
fought for and have gotten you a law-
yer at the border for your child. 
So with the drug cartels, the truth is 
this child will likely be an indentured 
servant for many years, either drug 
trade or sex traffic, but they are going 
to be owned by the drug cartel, as far 
as what they get to do in their free-
dom. This is not something we should 
be doing, adding more to lure more un-
accompanied children up to our border. 
We are already in crisis mode. 
As all of the Border Patrol that I 
have talked to over the years ex-
plained, they are basically working 
now for the drug cartels. As they have 
said, we are the logistics for the drug 
cartels. The cartels send them up, get 
them to the border, and then we ship 
them wherever the cartels want us to 
send them. 
This is not as compassionate as it 
may seem. This is going to damage 
millions of people. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this bill. 
In the midst of an unprecedented and 
ongoing border crisis, as CBP struggles 
to keep up, Democrats focus on a bill 
that will not only be expensive but will 
continue to hamper and slow down our 
hardworking women and men with the 
CBP. 
Almost a billion taxpayer dollars—al-
most a billion taxpayer dollars—pro-
vided for by the hardworking men and 
women in America, both legal immi-
grants and others, literally, to provide 
access to legal representation to non-
citizens. I guess they would call it non-
citizen human infrastructure. But real-
ly it is just another payday for law-
yers. 
America is struggling. Our borders 
are 
struggling. 
Our 
neighbors 
are 
struggling. We all want to help. But 
let’s help America. Let’s love America. 
Let’s take care of our American people. 
Oppose this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I am the daughter of immigrants. My 
mother came to this country as a ref-
ugee, and we are speaking about those 
who are seeking refuge in our country. 
When my mother came to this coun-
try, there was a process. There was 
order. I visited the border a couple of 
weeks ago, and there was just absolute 
disorder and chaos. 
It is shocking that this body refuses 
to take any action, that the Vice Presi-
dent, after 28 days of being appointed 
to oversee this issue, refuses to go to 
the border and see what I saw, hear 
what I heard. 
You need to have a discussion with 
Customs and Border Protection before 
taking any action on legislation. They 
will tell you that they are being over-
run by the cartels and the smugglers, 
who are taking over the border and 
making half a billion dollars a month 
doing it. 
The action we are taking here today 
will do nothing to help the 9-year-old 
girl that we saw in this facility who 
was gang raped on her journey here. 
How come nobody cares or has the 
compassion to do anything about those 
individuals who are being exploited by 
the smugglers and cartels? That is 
what we should be discussing here 
today. 
To go into one of these facilities and 
see these children, sleeping on top of 
each other—capacity of 250, and they 
have 4,000 people jammed in there. No 
COVID testing. Nobody cares about the 
public health crisis that is creating. 
So you have a humanitarian crisis, a 
public health crisis, and on top of it a 
national security crisis. Thousands of 
criminals being caught at the border 
and nobody is doing a damn thing 
about it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
gentlewoman from New York is exactly 
right. When will the Democrats take it 
seriously? When will the President go 
to the border? When will the Vice 
President go to the border, the person 
who is supposed to be in charge of deal-
ing with this crisis? When will the 
press be able to enter the holding fa-
cilities and actually show the Amer-
ican people how bad it is, what Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS just described? 
When will Secretary Mayorkas come 
in front of the Judiciary Committee? 
We have asked for him to come, answer 
our questions, tell us how he is dealing 
with this crisis. 
When are the Democrats going to 
take this seriously? We do. We have all 
been down there. We asked them to go. 
They wouldn’t go with us. 
The 
American 
people 
understand 
what is going on, how bad it is. I just 
hope the Democrats will deal with it 
sometime soon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, H.R. 1573 
provides access to counsel for individ-
uals referred to the secondary inspec-
tion station, but there are over 328 
ports of entry to the United States. 
Those field executives, if this is en-
acted, would, in fact, be handling over 
17 million people who might seek as-
sistance. 
In the upcoming motion to recom-
mit, we will offer that, in fact, the 
claim by this bill that there will be no 
cost for attorneys’ fees is, in fact, like-
ly to not be true. 
Last week the Congressional Budget 
Office estimated it would cost $828 mil-
lion to implement this legislation if 
enacted, and that would be without the 
right to free counsel. We need to ensure 
that these costs aren’t even higher. 
The Democrats have stated that H.R. 
1573 will not require the American peo-
ple to pay for attorneys accessed dur-
ing this administrative stop. And, 
again, Madam Speaker, this is an ad-
ministrative procedure. If, for any rea-
son, somebody is charged with a crime,

they immediately do get access to 
counsel. This is for those 17 million 
people who will go through secondary 
inspection and likely then be allowed 
to move forward. 
However, you need to look no further 
in this act than the comprehensive im-
migration reform bill of the U.S. Citi-
zenship Act for evidence that Demo-
crats want us to pay for counsel to for-
eign nationals. This bill specifically re-
moves the current prohibition on gov-
ernment-paid counsel. And yet, in the 
markup my colleagues insisted that 
this had no right to counsel. If you 
want more evidence than this, the 
American people deserve an assurance 
in this bill. We will ask in the motion 
to recommit that we add that specific 
prohibition in this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from California an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, in the 
language of the motion to recommit 
H.R. 1573, no one will doubt that Con-
gress either does or does not have the 
intent to make sure that the voters 
and our taxpayers are protected. I urge 
my colleagues to support the motion to 
recommit. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 1573 to en-
sure that no taxpayer funds are used. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from California an 
additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to insert the text 
of the amendment in the RECORD im-
mediately prior to the vote on the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, for 
all the reasons that we have stated 
here in the last half hour, we urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of 
nonsense on this floor. I have heard a 
lot of fiction on this floor today, but 
not everything the Republicans have 
said is fiction. 
They said, for instance, there is a cri-
sis at the border. Indeed, there is a cri-
sis at the border. 
The crisis at the border started under 
President Trump and has continued 
under President Biden; the same crisis. 
The difference is that President Trump 
tried to deal with the crisis in the cru-
elest way possible, by tearing babies 
away from their parents, by tearing 
families apart, and by doing so, so in-
competently—I assume it was incom-
petence; maybe it was malevolence, I 
don’t know—that they didn’t even get 
the records so that people today can 
figure out how to reunite these fami-
lies. 
The crisis continues, but at least we 
are dealing with it. We are trying to 
deal with it in a humane way. 
It is also interesting the fictions we 
have heard about this bill: This bill 
will cost money, this bill gives people 
the right to an attorney, and the Fed-
eral Government will have to pay for 
that attorney. Not true. Not true. 
I suspect my Republican colleagues 
have lost the ability to read a bill 
somehow. The bill is very clear. The 
bill simply says that if someone with 
valid documents—valid documents—no 
litigation as to whether they are valid 
or not, they have got to be valid in the 
first place, a U.S. citizen, a green card 
holder, someone with a valid visa, that 
is all we are talking about. The bill 
simply says that those people, if de-
tained at a border entry point for a pe-
riod of time for longer than an hour 
have the right to make a phone call. 
A phone call doesn’t cost the govern-
ment anything. They have the right to 
make a phone call. To whom? To who-
ever they want. A family member, per-
haps an attorney, a friend, whoever 
they want. 
Experience tells us that when people 
can make a phone call to an attorney 
in such a situation because the INA, 
the Immigration and Naturalization 
Act, is so complicated, it can often 
straighten things out, and that saves 
the government money. Because they 
don’t have to litigate, it saves the gov-
ernment money. So this bill will not 
cost the government any money. It will 
save it money. 
b 1500 
It will also help people who must be 
helped—again, I stress, only those peo-
ple who have a valid document to enter 
the United States and for some reason 
are detained at the border. 
How long does this last? Eight hours, 
at most. That is what the bill says, 8 
hours. 
This bill is limited to a measure that 
Members on both sides of the aisle, ev-
erybody, should embrace. As I said be-
fore, this is not a bill about a right to 
counsel. It is simply a bill about fair 
process. It ensures that individuals 
seeking to enter the United States 
with facially valid documents—a visa, 
a green card, including U.S. citizens 
who may have a passport—are given an 
opportunity to call somebody, a family 
member, counsel, another interested 
party, whoever they want, if they are 
subject to prolonged inspection. 
Admissibility decisions by Customs 
and Border Protection can have life-al-
tering consequences. This bill will en-
sure that CBP has the relevant facts 
prior to making decisions, the relevant 
facts, and facts that don’t cost the CBP 
anything to get. Well, they do, actu-
ally: the cost of a phone call. I take 
that back. It would cost the CBP the 
cost of a phone call, although not nec-
essarily, because the person may have 
their cell phone on him. So, it won’t 
even cost the cost of a telephone. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of the Access to Counsel Act. It 
makes sense. It hurts nobody. It im-
poses no duty on the government. It 
imposes no cost on the government. 
But it does mean that people will not 
unnecessarily get caught up in bu-
reaucracy. I urge my colleagues to vote 
in support of the Access to Counsel 
Act, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support 
of H.R. 1573, the ‘‘Access to Counsel Act of 
2021’’, which would ensure that certain individ-
uals who are subject to prolonged inspection 
by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
at ports of entry have the ability to commu-
nicate with and receive the assistance of 
counsel and other interested parties at no ex-
pense to the government. 
The Access to Counsel Act does the fol-
lowing: 
Allows individuals who already have legal 
status in the United States who are held in 
secondary inspection at airports or other 
points of entry for more than an hour with an 
opportunity to access legal counsel or an in-
terested party, such as a relative or someone 
with a bona fide relationship, under certain cir-
cumstances. 
Allows counsel or a covered interested party 
the ability to advocate on behalf of the indi-
vidual by providing information or documenta-
tion in support of the individual. 
Affirms the opportunity to access to counsel 
attaches no later than one hour after the sec-
ondary inspection process begins and as nec-
essary throughout the process. 
Invalidates any effort by CBP to persuade 
someone to relinquish their legal status (by 
executing a I–407 or Record of Abandonment 
of Lawful Permanent Resident Status) if that 
person has been denied access to counsel or 
voluntarily waives, in writing, the opportunity to 
seek advice from counsel. 
In 2017, Juan Garcia Mosqueda, a decade- 
long legal permanent resident of the U.S., was 
detained at John F. Kennedy International Air-
port in New York City and sent back to his na-
tive Argentina by a CBP agent who told him 
that, ‘‘lawyers had no jurisdiction at the bor-
ders.’’ 
This statement, made in the weeks following 
implementation of the former president’s 2017 
travel ban, lays bare the vulnerable situation 
faced by people upon their arrival to the 
United States. 
Behind closed doors without a friend or 
counsel, people are subjected to prolonged 
questioning, coercion, extended detention, 
mistreatment and summary expulsion. 
Many lose valuable rights, and sometimes 
more, as CBP agents interpret and apply com-
plex immigration rules to decide people’s lives 
without the benefit of a knowledgeable advo-
cate. 
While many within the agency interpret and 
apply the law competently, the position does 
not require more than a high school degree, 
and CBP inspectors continue to act as judge, 
jury and expulsioner without so much as a

whisper allowed during that decision making 
from an attorney representing the banished. 
We are a country of laws, and we hold as 
a cherished tradition the concept of due proc-
ess of law. 
The need for this bill became apparent after 
the Trump Administration implemented the 
Muslim ban in early 2017, resulting in individ-
uals being detained at airports, while others 
being barred from boarding flights and pulled 
off planes abroad. 
In 2020, we saw additional instances of 
CBP officers unjustly detaining Iranian Ameri-
cans for up to 12 hours at the northern border 
in Blaine, WA and detaining and deporting Ira-
nian students who were attending U.S. univer-
sities and people from Iran traveling on valid 
visas. 
Immigrants and civil rights activists have 
also raised concerns that CBP appears to tar-
get individuals for inspection based on racial 
profiling, and often holds U.S. citizens with 
proper documentation in secondary inspection 
without access to an attorney. 
For example, three Black CBP officers re-
cently filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging 
CBP routinely targets and harasses Black 
travelers at the Blue Water bridge between 
Port Huron and Sarnia on the Canada-Michi-
gan border. 
A March 25, 2021 report by the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Michigan examined 
CBP data on apprehensions at the Michigan- 
Canada border and corroborates these allega-
tions. 
The report found that between 2012 and 
2019, over 96 percent of the 13,000 docu-
mented apprehensions involved people of 
color, and one-third involved U.S. citizens. 
In another example, Tianna Spears, a Black 
U.S. citizen diplomat working at the U.S. con-
sulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico said that she 
was targeted regularly for inspection over a 
four month period, despite crossing the border 
daily, possessing a diplomatic passport and 
Global Entry approval, and having registered 
her car in the SENTRI system. 
She states that during these encounters, 
she was unable to contact counsel or State 
Department colleagues who could verify her 
identity. 
After four months of regular apprehensions, 
she began to develop symptoms of PTSD, 
and was forced to transfer to a different post. 
She later resigned from the State Department. 
Madam Speaker, we must ensure that peo-
ple are treated fairly during the inspections 
process, and to do so at the very minimum re-
quires that CBP permit representation of coun-
sel when requested during inspections. 
I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 1573 
and send a powerful message that this House 
stands firmly behind America’s well-earned 
and long established reputation of being the 
most welcoming nation on earth. 
[From Curbed, Mar. 2, 2017] 
OWNER OF NYC DESIGN GALLERY DETAINED AT 
AIRPORTS, DENIED RE-ENTRY TO U.S. 
Juan Garcia Mosqueda, founder of New 
York art and design gallery Chamber and a 
decade-long legal permanent resident of the 
U.S., was detained last Friday at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport in New York 
City and was sent back to his native Argen-
tina, ahead of his gallery’s new show—Do-
mestic Appeal, Part III—which opens to-
night. 
In an open letter titled The Visible Wall 
released by Mosqueda on Tuesday, he called 
the experience ‘‘dehumanizing and degrad-
ing,’’ and detailed his 36-hours-long detain-
ment, questioning, and return to Buenos 
Aires. 
The reaction from the design community 
was 
swift 
and 
impassioned. 
Posting 
Mosqueda’s open letter on Tuesday, Sight 
Unseen wrote: ‘‘We are strongly against this 
administration’s unfair and un-American 
targeting of immigrants—and not just those 
who are important design gallerists, but all 
those who seek to make a better life here.’’ 
Designers, 
journalists, 
and 
other 
sup-
porters took to Twitter to rally behind 
Mosqueda and decry his alleged treatment. 
Of the response from the design commu-
nity, Mosqueda said this in a statement 
emailed to Curbed: 
Since issuing the letter . . . I have received 
tremendous support from not only the design 
community in New York but from people all 
over the world. I greatly appreciate every-
one’s kind words and concern following this 
unfortunate incident. 
My reason for sharing my experience was 
to bring to light the situation currently fac-
ing immigrants from around the world and 
to encourage my American friends to con-
tact your local congressmen and push for im-
migration reform. I am currently in the 
process of dealing with my reentry into the 
United States and for this reason I am not 
able to speak with media at this time. Thank 
you again for your support. 
You can read Mosqueda’s open letter in full 
below. 
THE VISIBLE WALL 
DEAR FRIENDS: This past Friday, February 
24, 2017, I was denied entry into the United 
States—the nation where I have been legally 
residing for the past ten years. The proce-
dure was dehumanizing and degrading every 
step of the way. 
After being escorted to the secondary in-
spection premises, I was brought down for in-
terrogation where I was questioned under 
oath and threatened with the possibility of 
being barred from entering the country for 
five years. 
The border patrol officer denied me the 
right to legal counseling, arrogantly claim-
ing that lawyers had no jurisdiction at the 
borders. Shortly after my sworn statement 
was delivered to the chief officer in charge, 
they informed me that I was not permitted 
to come into the country and, therefore, 
would be forced onto the return flight to 
Buenos Aires later that evening. 
During the following fourteen excruciat-
ingly painful hours, I was prohibited from 
the use of any means of communication and 
had no access to any of my belongings, which 
were ferociously examined without any war-
rant whatsoever. I was deprived of food. I 
was frisked three times in order to go to the 
bathroom, where I had no privacy and was 
under the constant surveillance of an officer. 
Finally, I was escorted by two armed offi-
cers directly onto the plane and denied my 
documents until I reached my destination, 
Buenos Aires. 
This thirty-six hour nightmare is nothing 
but clear evidence of a deeply flawed immi-
gration system in the United States, carried 
out by an administration that is more inter-
ested in expelling people than admitting 
them. 
I was educated in America, worked at pres-
tigious design entities, and, now, as you all 
know, own a gallery which employs Ameri-
cans and non-Americans alike. Chamber sup-
ports architecture and design studios in the 
United States and abroad. 
I own several properties in New York and 
have collaborated in numerous projects with 
architects, contractors, and construction 
workers to bring to life projects around the 
city. We have created a network within the 
creative industries that span all disciplines 
and media that help individuals sustain their 
practices and do what they love. 
We proudly carry the New York flag to 
every fair that we do and every project we 
initiate across the globe. We self-publish 
books printed in the United States. And, 
needless to say, we pay considerable federal 
and state taxes that help fund many of the 
societal aspects that fuel the American en-
gine. 
Although I am not an American citizen, 
Chamber is an American product that I hope 
adds to the cultural landscape of the coun-
try. The gallery was conceived in alignment 
with the same idea of inclusion that was 
found in the streets of the Lower East Side 
(where I live and was denied access to) not so 
long ago: a melting pot of all nationalities 
and religions, importing ideas from abroad 
to a culturally embracing metropolis. 
We have worked with over 200 artists and 
designers, from Tokyo to Los Angeles, from 
Amstetdam to Santiago, in our less than 
three years of existence and rely heavily on 
social mobility to get our message across 
and display the works that we want to show. 
To my American friends, I urge you to con-
tact your congressmen and push for immi-
gration reform. Push for a system that does 
not alienate, intimidate, and bully for-
eigners but that, on the contrary, welcomes 
and encourages citizens from all countries to 
want to keep investing in and contributing 
to your wonderful country. 
This coming Thursday, I will not be able to 
celebrate the opening of our newest show, 
Domestic Appeal, which my team and I 
worked hard to conceive, and will not be able 
to meet some of the incredible participants 
that are traveling to the United States to 
take pride in displaying their creations in 
one of the most culturally relevant cities on 
the planet. 
Please come see it, have a glass of wine, 
and enjoy it on my behalf! 
Hope to see you all very soon, 
JUAN GARCIA MOSQUEDA, 
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Madam Speaker, I rise to seek sup-
port for the Extending Temporary

Analogues Act. 
As 
we 
continue 
to 
combat 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we are also facing 
a tragic, growing trend of overdose 
deaths across this country. 
We have lost nearly 1 million Ameri-
cans since the beginning of the Na-
tion’s drug epidemic. These Americans 
are sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, 
neighbors, coworkers, and members of 
our communities. Now, data tells us 
that the COVID–19 pandemic, increased 
isolation, and related economic hard-
ships over the past year may be ham-
pering efforts to turn the tide. 
Last week, Madam Speaker, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
released its most recent data finding 
that, from August 2019 to August 2020, 
there were 88,000 overdose deaths re-
ported. That is the highest ever re-
corded in a 12-month period. 
This most recent data represents a 
worsening crisis driven primarily by 
synthetic opioids, such as illicitly 
manufactured fentanyl. This drug is 50 
times more potent than heroin and 100 
times more potent than morphine. Al-
though fentanyl itself is often used for 
medical purposes, use of illicitly manu-
factured fentanyl has increased in re-
cent years, including co-use with co-
caine and methamphetamines. As little 
as 2 milligrams can cause a lethal over-
dose. 
Congress has recognized this unprece-
dented threat and acted in strong bi-
partisan fashion to combat it with re-
sources to communities around the 
country. We passed major pieces of leg-
islation like the Comprehensive Addic-
tion and Recovery Act, the 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for 
Patients and Communities Act. 
At the end of last year, in the final 
omnibus bill, we included over $4 bil-
lion to increase mental health and sub-
stance use services and support. Recog-
nizing the worsening trends early this 
year, we passed the American Rescue 
Plan last month that provided an addi-
tional $4 billion in resources. This crit-
ical funding will be used to enhance 
mental health and substance use dis-
order services supported by the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration, the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration, 
and the Indian Health Service. 
Madam Speaker, while this critical 
assistance is on the way, unfortu-
nately, due to the disturbing rates of 
overdose and substance use, more work 
is clearly needed. The Biden adminis-
tration is asking Congress to extend a 
temporary tool we provided last Con-
gress so that agency experts can come 
together to examine the facts and come 
up with an effective, long-term solu-
tion. That tool is the authority to tem-
porarily classify fentanyl-related sub-
stances as schedule I substances under 
the Controlled Substances Act. 
Ensuring fentanyl-related substances 
remain scheduled will maintain an im-
portant deterrent to traffickers, manu-
facturers, and those distributing this 
substance. 
During an Energy and Commerce 
Committee hearing last week, the 
White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy’s Acting Director Re-
gina LaBelle testified on the impor-
tance of this extension. Acting Direc-
tor LaBelle highlighted ongoing discus-
sions with the Department of Health 
and Human Services, the Department 
of Justice, and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. She testified that an 
extension of this temporary authority 
would allow executive branch agencies 
time to convene and present a long- 
term solution to this ever-changing 
drug environment that balances the 
risk of illicit fentanyl with the need to 
ensure appropriate enforcement. 
The Biden administration is taking 
this drug epidemic seriously and has 
delivered a thoughtful, thorough set of 
drug policy priorities. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in giving these agen-
cy experts time to produce a thought-
ful, thorough solution to this scourge 
of overdose deaths. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I am disappointed that we are kick-
ing the can down the road on a short- 
term extension of DEA’s emergency 
scheduling order to keep dangerous 
fentanyl analogues in schedule I. 
While I will vote in favor of this bill 
today because allowing this lifesaving 
order to expire is unacceptable, this 
short-term extension from the Demo-
cratic majority fails to meet the grav-
ity of the situation facing our commu-
nities, our border, and our country. 
They have had 2 years to come to the 
table and work with us on a permanent 
solution 
to 
combat 
fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl analogues and the dangers 
that they pose to Americans. If we 
don’t act, these dangerous drugs being 
smuggled across our southern border 
would effectively become street legal. 
We need a permanent solution to 
save the lives of people in despair and 
to protect our communities, and we 
need Democrats in the House and the 
Senate to wake up and take it seri-
ously. Nearly all States are seeing a 
spike in synthetic opioid deaths, with 
10 Western States reporting a more 
than 98 percent increase. This pan-
demic has made it worse. 
In my home State of Washington, the 
fentanyl positivity rate has increased 
236 percent, more than any other State 
in the country. My community lost 
two teenagers recently from a sus-
pected fentanyl-related death. They 
had their whole lives in front of them.

Lincoln on our penny—that is a pretty 
small amount—is lethal. 
Fentanyl analogues are oftentimes 
more potent, and more than a thousand 
of them have been created over the 
years to mimic fentanyl’s opioid ef-
fects and outsmart the law. 
With class-wide scheduling, any dan-
gerous variant of fentanyl is controlled 
under schedule I. According to the 
DEA, right now, there are 27 new 
fentanyl-related substances that have 
been 
encountered 
and 
immediately 
controlled under the class-wide sched-
uling order. All of those substances are 
many times more potent than heroin 
and pose serious health and safety 
risks. One recently encountered sub-
stance was approximately eight times 
more potent than fentanyl. 
In addition to the ongoing, unprece-
dented humanitarian crisis at the bor-
der, fentanyl and other dangerous 
opioids are also pouring across our bor-
der at an ever-increasing rate. The Bor-
der Patrol just reported a 233 percent 
increase in fentanyl seizures at the 
southern border just in the last year. 
If 
the 
class-wide 
scheduling 
of 
fentanyl-related substances is allowed 
to expire, drug traffickers will be fur-
ther emboldened to smuggle this poi-
son into our communities. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
also 
worked hard to make the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party 
accountable 
for 
the 
fentanyl analogues that were being 
manufactured in China, forcing them 
to crack down on it. If we let this ex-
pire and do not make it permanent, we 
will be sending a clear message to the 
CCP that it is okay for them to ease up 
and let this illicit industry continue to 
grow. 
Moving forward, we must work with 
the DEA and other agencies to make 
this scheduling permanent, just like 
Mr. LATTA’s FIGHT Fentanyl Act, 
while making reforms to improve sci-
entific research on these substances. 
I am glad that the majority is agree-
ing with us that we cannot let this ex-
pire. I am gravely disappointed that it 
is only a few months. This extension 
will buy us far less time than the 1- 
year extension Republican leader JIM 
JORDAN and I put forward and the 7- 
month extension that was requested by 
the Biden administration. 
If this 5-month extension is signed 
into law, I call on Democrats and Re-
publicans to begin working imme-
diately on a longer term solution. We 
stand ready to immediately begin the 
bipartisan work necessary to get a per-
manent fix signed into law. I am com-
mitted to working over the next 5 
months to solve this issue once and for 
all and not just settle on a short-term 
extension. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this temporary extension, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New Hampshire 
(Mr. PAPPAS), the sponsor of this legis-
lation. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today and 
urge the swift passage of H.R. 2630. 
This legislation will save American 
lives 
by 
getting 
deadly 
chemical 
fentanyl analogues off our streets and 
allowing law enforcement to swiftly 
bring drug traffickers to justice. 
The CDC reports that there were 
more than 50,000 deaths involving syn-
thetic opioids in the 12-month period 
ending in July 2020—50,000 deaths in 12 
months. 
The addiction crisis has worsened as 
a result of this pandemic, and this is 
not the time to let regulations lapse or 
to back away from our commitment to 
get people the help that they need. 
My State of New Hampshire, like so 
many, has been hit incredibly hard by 
fentanyl and its chemical analogues. 
Chemical versions of fentanyl are ever- 
changing, and we know that traffickers 
intentionally make small variations in 
substances, knowing that the sched-
uling process may take months in 
order to place these deadly drugs on 
schedule I where they belong. This 
means that traffickers are often one 
step ahead of law enforcement. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
legislation 
helps prevent that by ensuring all 
fentanyl analogues are categorized as 
schedule I. 
The DEA first issued a temporary 
order in February of 2018, and Congress 
wisely passed legislation extending 
that order through May 6. 
Madam Speaker, my legislation, the 
Extending 
Temporary 
Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, 
would extend that order and, again, en-
sure that constantly changing chem-
ical versions of fentanyl, often smug-
gled in from Mexico and China, are la-
beled as schedule I. 
The bill would prevent our commu-
nities from being flooded with syn-
thetic opioids and will ensure that 
those trafficking them will be held ac-
countable without delay. 
People are in a fight for their lives 
right now. Our country continues to be 
ravished by addiction. To let down our 
guard at this moment would cause un-
mistakable harm to our families and 
our communities. 
I am hopeful that we will see swift bi-
partisan action in Congress to grant 
this extension. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE), the lead Republican on the 
Health Subcommittee. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today very concerned about the 
deadly threat of fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogues. 
Last week, the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce held a hearing on this 
exact issue. 
Here are the facts: More than 88,000 
overdose deaths were reported by the 
CDC in a 12-month period ending in Au-
gust of 2020. This is a record for the 
highest number of overdose deaths ever 
recorded in a year. 
In 2018, synthetic opioids, which in-
cludes these dangerous fentanyl ana-
logues, were involved in 744 deaths in 
just Kentucky. I learned from a sub-
stance use healthcare provider in my 
district that almost all their patients 
have some sort of fentanyl in their sys-
tem. Many of the patients are not 
aware of it themselves. Just last 
month a 2-year-old in Kentucky died 
from exposure to fentanyl; therefore, I 
support a permanent solution of sched-
uling fentanyl analogues. 
Last week, some of my colleagues— 
and we had witnesses—tried to argue 
that a long-term solution for banning 
fentanyl is a social justice issue. In 
fact, one witness shared, ‘‘it is being 
argued that fentanyl class scheduling 
is suddenly unnecessary because of the 
low number of prosecutions to date— 
eight. However, eight mandatory min-
imum sentences in 3 years, four of 
them being members of a cartel, proves 
that prosecutors are not going after 
low-level users. 
The witness also argued that this 
scheduling of fentanyl analogues—the 
decrease of new fentanyl analogues 
coming to this country was 90 percent. 
If someone is being unjustly pros-
ecuted for fentanyl analogues, then 
that should be addressed. 
However, not scheduling fentanyl 
analogues, when we had a witness tes-
tify it drops 90 percent being imported, 
would be deadly for Americans since 
fentanyl and its analogues are respon-
sible for thousands of deaths each year. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Tampa, Florida, 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS), a leader on the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the United States 
remains in the grip of an overdose pan-
demic, unfortunately. I rise today in 
support of the Extending Temporary 
Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl 
Analogues Act. 
Madam Speaker, 3 years ago, DEA 
temporarily scheduled fentanyl ana-
logues as controlled substances to 
crack down on China and drug traf-
fickers smuggling fentanyl across the 
southern border. Last year, Congress 
passed the temporary extension that 
continued to criminalize fentanyl ana-
logues until May 6 of this year. 
Previously, drug traffickers could 
slightly change the molecules in the 
drug, so the formula was not tech-
nically considered fentanyl and was 
not prohibited, although it was still po-
tent, leading to a lethal game of 
whack-a-mole. 
Madam Speaker, locally, we have 
seen that fentanyl has been a major 
problem, even with the scheduling in 
place. Pasco County, in my district,

has already had 48 people die from 
overdoses since January of this year, 
and many communities throughout the 
country are experiencing the same 
overdose increases as the pandemic has 
only exacerbated the mental health 
and addiction crisis in our country. 
Madam Speaker, if this scheduling 
ban 
expires, 
we 
expect 
far 
more 
fentanyl to flood our streets and many 
more lives to be tragically lost. We 
cannot allow this to happen. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in ex-
tending this current ban and to work 
together in a bipartisan manner on a 
permanent solution—it must be a pri-
ority—a permanent solution to this 
scourge. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman of the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce for the con-
stant diligence that he has in the land-
scape of healthcare and energy, con-
sumer issues. Certainly, as a member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary, we 
are looking forward to working with 
this committee on a very important 
matter. 
So I want to acknowledge the work 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and indicate that isn’t it sad 
that we have not been able to find com-
mon ground to work on this issue. I am 
very concerned that what we are now 
doing, we probably would need more 
time for our committees to work to-
gether. I am concerned that we might 
be extending the Trump administra-
tion’s temporary class-wide emergency 
scheduling of fentanyl, a substance 
that all of us vigorously opposed. 
Madam Speaker, I think the chair-
man is well-aware of my longstanding 
concern on criminalizing substance 
abuse instead of preventing and treat-
ing it. I know that our two committees 
have a common perspective and agree-
ment on that, but I have seen failed 
policies in my own neighborhood that 
have disproportionately impacted com-
munities of color. 
For instance, in the 1980s, Congress 
adopted harsh mandatory minimum 
sentences for crack cocaine offenses 
and 
putting 
many 
in 
unjust 
and 
lengthy terms of imprisonment. 
Madam Speaker, I simply want to in-
dicate an acknowledgment of fentanyl 
and its impact that it has had, and I 
want to acknowledge the importance of 
us working together. But I also want to 
put on the record my concern with the 
DEA’s temporary order that would 
group all fentanyl-related substances 
under a class-wide ban. 
You see, what I know we can docu-
ment is that the recipient, the taker, 
gets the short end of the criminal jus-
tice stick, and with that, I have con-
cerns. But as we take more time to do 
this, I want to make sure the traf-
fickers, the cartels, the gangs, are put 
in the eye of the storm where they be-
long. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, just to put on the 
record that the data shows that there 
are already significant racial dispari-
ties in some of the Federal cases and 
mandatory minimum sentences involv-
ing fentanyl analogues. 
I don’t want to put words in the 
mouth of my chairman, Chairman PAL-
LONE, but I have heard him speak to 
these issues, and I am grateful for it. I 
am grateful for his sensitivity. So I 
wanted to come to the floor knowing 
the work that has been done, but also 
knowing your understanding. And I 
wanted to just make sure that these 
communities that cannot speak for 
themselves clearly are put on the 
record. 
I need not say that the trial that we 
just had with the George Floyd case 
and what was trying to be represented 
in that case, albeit was a very tiny or 
minute or nonexistent amount. So I 
want to make sure that we do this 
right and we get the time to do it. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his leadership. 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
April 19, 2021. 
President JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr., 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: We write to ex-
press our serious concerns with class-wide 
scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, 
joining with our colleagues Senators Booker, 
Hirono, Markey, Warren and Whitehouse, 
who wrote to you about this issue on April 
14. We too commend your commitment to 
end mandatory minimums, to address racial 
disparities, and to achieve criminal justice 
reform. We also agree with the Administra-
tion’s recognition of the pressing need to 
‘‘eradicate racial, gender and economic in-
equities that currently exist in the criminal 
justice system. We look forward to working 
with your Domestic Policy Council and the 
interagency working group that has been 
formed to develop specific policy solutions 
for criminal justice reform. At the same 
time, we also hope to collaborate with you 
and your Administration to enact just and 
restorative policies that will meaningfully 
transform our nation’s response to substance 
use disorders through the lens of public 
health and racial equity. 
We agree with our Senate colleagues that 
fentanyl use is a serious concern. Combat-
ting substance use, including the illicit use 
of fentanyl, is a top priority for all of us. 
However, we ask that you reject the last Ad-
ministration’s misguided approach to the 
opioid epidemic, especially regarding class- 
wide scheduling of fentanyl analogues. 
As an initial matter, federal prosecutors 
may already pursue charges concerning 
harmful fentanyl analogues, with or without 
class-wide 
scheduling. 
In 
addition, 
classifying all fentanyl analogues as Sched-
ule I substances is unnecessary for federal 
prosecutions of these cases. Independent 
from any temporary scheduling order for cer-
tain substances, the federal government has 
the authority to prosecute anyone who pos-
sesses, imports, distributes, or manufactures 
any unscheduled fentanyl analogue with a 
high potential for abuse, no medical value, 
and the ability to cause overdose deaths. In 
addition, the Department of Justice can con-
tinue to prosecute any case involving the il-
licit manufacturing or distribution of any 
fentanyl-related substances under a separate 
statutory scheme established by the Federal 
Analogue Act. The DEA can also continue to 
use its existing authority to schedule spe-
cific fentanyl-related substances as Con-
trolled Substances under the well-estab-
lished interagency process. 
However, under the Trump Administra-
tion, the Drug Enforcement Administration 
used its emergency scheduling authority to 
place certain fentanyl analogues onto Sched-
ule I of the Controlled Substances Act. The 
Temporary Scheduling Order (‘‘the Order’’) 
scheduled a general ‘‘class’’ of ‘‘fentanyl-re-
lated substances.’’ In doing so, the Trump 
Administration expanded the application of 
mandatory minimum penalties to a broader 
range of federal cases, while also creating 
additional barriers to medical research. The 
Order also circumvented the standard proce-
dures for the scheduling of substances under 
the Controlled Substances Act, preventing 
input from the Department of Health and 
Human Services and other relevant inter-
agency experts. 
The Trump Administration’s Order also 
widened the net as far as the application of 
mandatory 
minimum 
penalties. 
As 
you 
know, people of color have been dispropor-
tionately subject to mandatory minimum 
sentences, preventing judges from being al-
lowed to apply penalties that fit the facts 
and circumstances of each case. Continu-
ation of this Order will further perpetuate 
current racial disparities that exist through-
out the criminal justice system. According 
to the most recent statistics from the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission, there are signifi-
cant racial disparities in the prosecution of 
fentanyl cases, with people of color com-
prising almost 75% of those sentenced in 
2019. This also holds true for federal convic-
tions in cases involving fentanyl analogues, 
for which 68% of those sentenced were people 
of color. To keep this approach in place— 
even temporarily—will further exacerbate 
existing racial disparities. 
In addition, mandatory minimum penalties 
continue to disproportionately impact indi-
viduals with a minor role in the offense. In 
2019, more than half of all federal fentanyl- 
analogue prosecutions involved a street-level 
seller or other minor role. During this chal-
lenging time, our most vulnerable commu-
nities, especially communities of color, have 
been disproportionately impacted by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Moving forward, we 
must not exacerbate these health and justice 
inequities. We need to reject approaches that 
expand 
criminal 
penalties, 
rather 
than 
prioritize evidence-based approaches to this 
public health crisis. 
Moreover, we need to work to reduce bar-
riers to research in order to expand opportu-
nities to identify antidotes to fentanyl-ana-
logue overdoses and to improve treatment 
options. By extending the Order, critical 
medical research will continue to be limited 
during a time when the country is facing 
even greater concerns regarding the opioid 
crisis and the rising number of overdoses. 
For these reasons, we urge you to discard 
this misguided approach. 
Drug addiction is a serious problem in 
communities across the country, and we are 
profoundly concerned about fentanyl-related 
deaths. The current pandemic has furthered 
worsened the tragic impact of overdoses as 
so many Americans continue to struggle 
through this isolating and stressful crisis. 
We must learn from the lessons of the past 
as we prioritize evidence-based, public health 
approaches and pursue better and more just 
means to address this problem, rather than

Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER), the only pharmacist on our com-
mittee, and a leader on this issue. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to 
ask my colleagues across the aisle to 
set aside this weak bill and support 
permanently—permanently as in for-
ever—scheduling fentanyl and its ana-
logues. 
We just heard from the gentlewoman 
from Texas. We all agree: It is not 
good. Fentanyl is the problem. 
Here, we have an opportunity for us 
to work together to help stem the flow 
of deadly fentanyl and its analogues in 
our country. This is an issue that im-
pacts every one of us—every one of us. 
Whether we are Republican, Democrat, 
Independent, it impacts every one of us 
in our communities. 
Just last week, in my home State of 
Georgia, the Georgia Attorney General 
announced that he is investigating 
fatal drug overdoses based on counter-
feit medications laced with fentanyl 
and its analogues. These individuals 
bought illegal products they believed 
to be Xanax, Percocet, and oxycodone. 
Overdoses like this happen every day 
all over the country—all over the coun-
try. Yet, some of my colleagues want 
to go soft on fentanyl analogues and 
let these products become legal in just 
mere weeks, or temporarily schedule it 
for a few months until they can craft 
another weak plan. 
How can anyone seriously argue that 
a drug 50 times more potent than her-
oin and which almost always proves 
fatal when ingested, should ever be 
legal? 
These products are manufactured il-
legally, and they are largely brought 
into the U.S. through the southern bor-
der. Every year, U.S. agents intercept 
enough fentanyl and its analogues to 
kill every single American several 
times over. In fact, Customs and Bor-
der Patrol announced in 2019, they had 
enough seized fentanyl to kill 800 mil-
lion people. And that is what they had 
seized; we don’t know what else came 
across. 
I visited the border last week to see 
the crisis firsthand. Border patrol 
agents are so overwhelmed with a 20- 
year record high number of illegal im-
migrants that smugglers and cartels 
are using this as an opportunity to 
traffic more fentanyl substances. 
If the President and Vice President 
would visit the border, they would be 
able to talk to the agents firsthand and 
see for themselves how serious the 
issue is. 
Instead, they have elected to leave 
our border wide open. We are inviting 
drug traffickers to bring fentanyl sub-
stances into the country and distribute 
it in our streets. This should not be a 
partisan issue. Fentanyl does not dis-
criminate. It does not. 
The individuals manufacturing and 
distributing fentanyl and its analogues 
are criminals, and they are getting our 
neighbors killed. This is not an issue 
that is going away. It is only getting 
worse. The CDC reports that there were 
enough overdoses last year than any 
single year before. 
This is the time for us to crack down 
on fentanyl-related substances, and I 
hope that we will do that.

Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 2630, to extend the temporary 
emergency scheduling of fentanyl ana-
logues. 
In the rural Pennsylvania commu-
nities that I represent, the fentanyl 
crisis 
is 
anything 
but 
temporary. 
Every day, we experience the ramifica-
tions of the opioid epidemic, which has 
only been exacerbated by the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
As the Franklin County coroner, Jeff 
Connor, 
told 
me 
just 
this 
week, 
‘‘Fentanyl is easy to get and fast to 
kill.’’ 
This is true across our entire Com-
monwealth. In my home of Blair Coun-
ty, we suffered an 80 percent increase 
in overdose deaths in 2020. As I have 
heard directly from our county cor-
oner, Patty Ross, there is no question 
that the widespread availability of il-
licit fentanyl is a substantial factor in 
our region’s drug epidemic. 
Fentanyl already poses a deadly 
threat to our communities. If we don’t 
act to extend the fentanyl import ban 
before it expires next month, we will 
invite massive vulnerabilities in our 
shared fight against the opioid crisis. 
In Pennsylvania and around the coun-
try, we need more accountability for 
those who bring illicit fentanyl into 
our communities. 
H.R. 2630 is lifesaving legislation that 
will give law enforcement and the jus-
tice system the tools that they need to 
keep this dangerous illicit drug off of 
our streets. This temporary fix needs 
to be the bridge to a permanent solu-
tion to protect the American people. 
We do not have time to waste. By pass-
ing this bipartisan legislation, we can 
protect families, equip those on the 
front line, and prevent tragedy. 
For the health and safety of our com-
munities, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to express my disappoint-
ment with H.R. 2630. 
What is happening down at our 
southern border is actually a crisis, 
and it is multiplying a crisis that has 
plagued this country for many years, 
and that is the opioid epidemic. 
Customs and Border Patrol agents 
have seized more than 4,900 pounds of 
fentanyl during the first 5 months of 
fiscal year 2021, already surpassing the 
total from last year. 
Mexican cartels are increasingly re-
sponsible for producing the supply of 
fentanyl into the U.S. market. China, 
we forget about China. China remains a 
key source of supply for the chemicals 
that the Mexican cartels are using to 
produce the fentanyl; all of this being 
smuggled into the U.S. through our 
western States. 
Madam Speaker, I introduced, along 
with Senator JOHNSON, the SOFA Act 
to permanently designate fentanyl as a 
schedule I drug, closing a loophole in 
current law that makes it difficult to 
prosecute crimes involving some syn-
thetic opioids. 
The GAO report released last week 
on class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-re-
lated substances found fewer law en-
forcement encounters with fentanyl, 
and reduced incentives for cartels to 
circumvent the law through new and 
existing fentanyl substances. 
While I plan to support this bill—I 
think everybody will—a 5-month exten-
sion is not nearly long enough. I urge 
Democrats to come back to the table 
to find a solution that will perma-
nently keep fentanyl as a schedule I 
drug. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. VAN 
DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, 
this issue should already have been 
taken care of. 
Last week, my Republican colleagues 
and I offered an amendment to extend 
this ban until at least 2022, but it was 
blocked, only to see Democrats draft 
this much weaker bill. It is another 
game and example of why Americans 
are fed up with Congress. 
When House Democrats rejected the 
Republican-led 
amendment 
banning 
fentanyl last week, they knew that 
fentanyl causes a massive blight in our 
communities across the country. They 
knew that tens of thousands are left 
dead from overdoses every year, but re-
fused to support it because of the 
names on the bill. And now they want 
to extend the ban of this highly addict-
ive, highly dangerous, deadly drug by 
only 5 months. 
Last month, CBP agents seized 639 
pounds of fentanyl, adding to the 2,098 
pounds seized this year alone. That 
represents a 233 percent increase of 
drugs being smuggled across the border

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2029 
April 21, 2021 
this year. It is a direct result of Biden’s 
border crisis. 
Vice President Harris was appointed 
as the so-called immigration czar, but 
has spent more time in New Hampshire 
than at the border. And if she were to 
visit, she would see the toll that the in-
flux of migrants is taking on our bor-
der. It is not just a humanitarian cri-
sis, but it is leaving us vulnerable to 
increased drug smuggling that is rav-
aging our streets. She would hear di-
rectly from the DEA agents, just like 
my colleagues and I did, why it is so 
important to schedule fentanyl as a 
schedule I drug permanently, not just 
for 5 months. 
A 5-month extension is not long 
enough. Let’s just stop playing poli-
tics. There is no excuse why we are not 
working toward a permanent ban. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would urge support for this bipartisan 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2630, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Tem-
porary Reauthorization and Study of 
the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl 
Analogues Act to extend until October 
2021, a temporary order for fentanyl-re-
lated substances.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE 
HOOSIERS KILLED AND INJURED 
IN 
THE 
SHOOTING 
AT 
THE 
FEDEX FACILITY IN INDIANAP-
OLIS 
(Mr. CARSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, joined by my fellow congres-
sional colleagues from Indiana, as well 
as our two Senators, to honor the eight 
Hoosiers we lost in last week’s sense-
less shooting at the FedEx facility in 
Indianapolis. We also honor those who 
were injured and pray that they have a 
fast and speedy recovery. 
The deceased were our friends, fam-
ily, and neighbors. They had hopes, 
Madam Speaker, dreams, and plans for 
the future, only to have their lives 
tragically cut short. And, sadly, they 
are part of a much larger group of Hoo-
siers and Americans we have lost to 
gun violence. 
As our community and our State 
grieve, and as we seek to move forward, 
we pledge to never forget those we lost 
in this shooting and any other sense-
less act of violence. Their legacies will 
live on through our efforts to save lives 
in the future. 
Hoosiers are resilient, Madam Speak-
er, and we will continue working hard 
to create safer communities across 
America, always carrying the memory 
of those we lost in our hearts. We will 
never forget them. 
Please join us for a moment of si-
lence.

HONORING JUANA SEQUEIRA 
SOLIS 
(Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in memory of Juana Sequeira Solis, 
who passed away in April at the age of 
94. Juana was the mother of former 
Congresswoman, former Secretary of 
Labor, and now L.A. County Supervisor 
Hilda Solis. 
Juana was born in 1926 in Nicaragua, 
the eldest of five. She immigrated to 
America when she was just 18, in 
search of a better life. 
After moving to Los Angeles, Juana 
met her late husband, Raul Solis, while 
taking citizenship classes. They raised 
seven children and taught them the 
values that define who we are as Amer-
icans: the importance of community, 
education, and respect for our environ-
ment. 
Juana spent over 20 years on the as-
sembly line at Mattel and was an ac-
tive union member with the United 
Rubber Workers until her retirement 
in 1991. 
Let us always remember Juana for 
her kindness, determination, and fight-
ing spirit. 
CELEBRATING 
CORPUS 
CHRISTI 
ARMY DEPOT’S 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Corpus Christi 
Army Depot, which celebrates its 60th 
anniversary today. 
CCAD is the premier rotary-winged 
helicopter repair and maintenance fa-
cility for the U.S. Army. 
Like a battle-hardened soldier, CCAD 
remains strong, committed, and dedi-
cated to answering the Nation’s call 
and keeping the Army flag flying. 
The freedom and security that Amer-
icans enjoy today are a direct result of 
the hard work and continuing commit-
ment of CCAD to the mission given by 
the U.S. Army. 
Thousands of military, civilian, and 
contractor employees have walked the 
halls, worked in the hangars, turned 
the wrenches, flown the aircraft, and 
dedicated themselves to the operation 
that began in 1961. 
The community leaders and citizens 
of Corpus Christi, Texas, recognize and 
appreciate the service of all personnel 
of CCAD, past and present. 
We salute this great organization’s 
unending mission. I wish the Corpus 
Christi Army Depot a happy 60th birth-
day today. 
f 
CELEBRATING EARTH DAY 
(Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as the proud sponsor of the 
resolution honoring Earth Day. 
For over 50 years, people have come 
together on April 22, which is tomor-
row, to support protections for our air, 
water, and land, and to increase appre-
ciation for Mother Earth. 
But every day, not just on Earth 
Day, we must commit ourselves to pro-
tecting our planet. We must embrace 
our shared responsibility to preserve 
our Earth, not only by increasing envi-
ronmental and climate literacy but by 
building upon efforts like the Paris 
Agreement to ensure that future gen-
erations inherit a livable, sustainable, 
and ecologically rich planet. 
Throughout 
the 
past 
year, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic has devastated our 
Nation. However, our natural environ-
ment, 
including 
parks 
and 
green 
spaces, has been a haven for commu-
nities to come together safely. 
This past year has reinforced the im-
portance of protecting these natural 
spaces and ensuring the continued 
cleaning and greening of all commu-
nities. 
Like those who celebrated the first 
Earth Day in 1970, tomorrow we must 
continue our work to address environ-
mental challenges, large and small, 
from climate change to litter; to edu-
cate friends, neighbors, and elected 
representatives about the need for 
year-round action; and to honor the 
stewardship ethic that serves as the 
foundation of this special day. 
Together, we can protect our planet, 
public health, and overall well-being of 
all people and wildlife. 
f 
ENACTING GREEN NEW DEAL WILL 
DESTROY JOBS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, just 
yesterday, the squad and other Demo-
crats reintroduced the socialist Green 
New Deal. 
This dangerous proposal costs over 
$90 trillion and will destroy thousands 
of American jobs. But Speaker PELOSI 
and President Biden have no intention 
of stopping it. In fact, they are plan-
ning to use their partisan infrastruc-
ture package as a vehicle to enact sev-
eral Green New Deal priorities. 
While details of what they consider 
infrastructure, and I use that term 
loosely, are not finalized, it does not 
inspire confidence that the Democrats 
are already turning away from regular 
order, which requires bipartisanship to 
get the bill through Congress. 
Here is what we know about the 
package so far. It advances $600 billion 
to Green New Deal priorities. Only 5 
percent will go toward roads and 
bridges and 2 percent for airways, wa-
terways, and ports. They are planning 
the largest tax hike since 1968 to pay 
for their agenda, and an estimate from 
the National Association of Manufac-
turers shows that their proposed cor-
porate tax hike would cost 1 million 
jobs. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DAY OF 
SILENCE 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the National 
Day of Silence this Friday, April 23. 
It is a day when people around the 
country and in my community on the 
central coast of California take a vow 
of silence to raise awareness sur-
rounding 
the 
many 
hurdles 
that 
LGBTQ youth face. 
One of those students will be Lucia 
Umeki-Martinez. Lucia is a gay woman 
of color and a student leader at 
Watsonville High School. As co-class 
president and member of the Sexuality 
and Gender Acceptance Club, Lucia 
works to build bridges between her 
classmates and community. 
She told me that taking the vow of 
silence for 1 day was her way of paying 
tribute to those who have been silenced 
by homophobia and hatred. It also is a 
way to show solidarity to those, like 
Lucia, who have ever felt unwelcome or

unsafe in an environment where they 
are supposed to thrive. 
Countless students across this coun-
try will take the vow of silence on Fri-
day for the same reasons as Lucia. 
That is why we as leaders must con-
tinue to step up every day to ensure 
that all Americans, whoever they are, 
are accepted and respected. 
f 
VOICING CONCERN ABOUT 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to give voice to the concern of mil-
lions of Americans, the crisis at our 
southern border. 
I saw it for myself. Not only are our 
facilities packed to 10 times beyond ca-
pacity, but the influx is growing. 
Biden revoked Trump’s effective bor-
der policies and put nothing in place to 
make up for it, creating the current 
crisis that is spiraling out of control. 
We need to send immediate aid to our 
Border Patrol. They need it. 
But here is what Congress is doing 
instead: 
We are voting to provide legal wel-
fare services to people illegally in our 
country while millions of Americans 
are denied help. 
We are voting on D.C. statehood, a 
violation of the constitutional function 
of our Capital City. 
The Speaker pushed 16 bills together 
in an en bloc last night, preventing 
Members of Congress from voting on 
separate pieces of legislation. 
The American people are watching 
what we do here. They see unserious 
people doing unserious work. It is why 
our approval rating is so poor. It is 
time to stop letting them down and do 
something real. 
f 
PREVENTING DISCRIMINATION 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 1333, the NO BAN Act, of which I 
am an original cosponsor and which 
passed the House earlier today. I thank 
and salute our good friend JUDY CHU as 
well as Chairman NADLER
and the 
Speaker for their leadership in bring-
ing this to the floor. 
This bill strengthens the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of religion 
and restores the separation of powers 
by limiting overly broad executive ac-
tions. 
President Biden’s recent executive 
order overturned Donald Trump’s rac-
ist and discriminatory ban, but we 
need to ensure that broad, xenophobic 
policies that are not based on actual 
national security concerns do not ever 
go into effect again. 
Make no mistake, the NO BAN Act 
would help ensure that this kind of dis-
crimination ceases, prevent future such 
discrimination, and promote our Na-
tion’s core value of religious freedom. 
The Muslim and African bans were an 
abuse of Presidential authority and 
based off of hateful campaign promises. 
The ban separated parents from their 
children and spouses from one another. 
This bill begins to repair the damage of 
the past 4 years. 
f 
OPPOSING BIDEN 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the $21⁄4 trillion boondoggle my col-
leagues across the aisle are trying to 
pass off as an infrastructure bill. 
Sadly, this bill is a socialist wish 
list. Less than 8 percent of President 
Biden’s infrastructure plan goes to 
roads, bridges, waterways, ports, and 
airports. 
What it does include is $400 billion 
for home-based caregivers. While that 
may be a good issue for review, it is 
not infrastructure. 
This comes as no surprise, consid-
ering D.C. Democrats are trying to 
lump a radical, progressive agenda into 
a so-called infrastructure bill. Still, 
the leftist fringe that has highjacked 
what used to be the Democratic Party 
doesn’t think it goes far enough. 
Madam Speaker, we spent trillions of 
dollars on COVID recovery and unre-
lated measures. Now is not the time for 
a socialist wish list. Americans need a 
strong economy and real infrastruc-
ture, and they need it now. 
f 
ALLOWING CHILD TAX CREDIT TO 
EXPIRE IS MISJUDGMENT 
(Mr. TORRES of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, according to The Washington 
Post, the administration plans to pro-
pose only a temporary rather than a 
permanent expansion of the child tax 
credit. 
Allowing the child tax credit to ex-
pire in 2025 is a colossal misjudgment 
whose consequences we could live to re-
gret. 
We cannot and should not be the 
party that cuts child poverty in half 
only until 2025. We should and must be 
the party that champions a permanent 
breakthrough against child poverty. 
Instead of making the most of our 
FDR and LBJ moment, we are in dan-
ger of inexplicably putting an expira-
tion date on our own legacy. Did Presi-
dent Roosevelt put an expiration date 
on Social Security? Did President 
Johnson put an expiration date on 
Medicare? Why should we put an expi-
ration date on the Social Security and 
Medicare of our own time? 
I urge President Biden to make his 
greatest achievement a permanent leg-
acy. 
REVIEWING DEMOCRATS’ 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with so much talk about infrastructure 
in the air lately, let’s do a quick re-
view. 
The last sizeable infrastructure bill 
was done in 2015, to the cost of about 
$300 billion. Now, what we see is a so- 
called infrastructure plan put out by 
the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
the 
House and Senate Democrats nine 
times that size, $2.7 trillion. 
We can probably find that much in-
frastructure to do, except there is a 
whole lot in this bill that is not infra-
structure. Much is social spending and 
other things that might be good in a 
different bill, but not this bill. 
Also, in order to pay for it, they 
would seek to dismantle the 2017 tax 
reforms that did so much to promote 
and boost our economy and bring jobs 
back to the United States. It unleashed 
record growth. Instead, we would hurt 
that economy by what is in the plan. 
How about, instead of tax hikes to 
cover what is essentially socialist 
spending tucked into a bill being la-
beled as infrastructure, let’s focus on 
the work needing done: highways, 
bridges, levees, dams for water storage, 
and broadband. These are the things 
people need and can actively use. What 
they don’t need are choking taxes that 
harm our economy. 
f 
STIFLING PROGRESS WITH 
FILIBUSTER 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the millions of 
Americans who are outraged as they 
witness 
mass 
shooting 
after 
mass 
shooting, with no action from their 
government; the millions of Americans 
who are struggling to make ends meet 
every day, while their government 
hasn’t raised the minimum wage in a 
decade, so they are struggling more 
than ever; and, similarly, Americans 
who are fighting for equality and civil 
rights while they see nothing being 
done in Congress. 
Every single week, this House passes 
legislation that is overwhelmingly pop-
ular among Americans, yet not one of 
these bills has seen the light of day be-
cause of the filibuster. It is truly a 
death grip on our democracy. 
The filibuster is being used by a 
handful of people to stifle progress that 
Americans 
overwhelmingly 
want, 
progress that would ban pay discrimi-
nation, progress that would protect our 
unions, progress that would protect 
voters’ rights, progress that would lit-
erally save lives by passing common-
sense gun reform. 
It is past time we get rid of the fili-
buster as it is today. The filibuster

HONORING DARREN CRUZAN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor 
Assistant 
Director 
Darren 
Cruzan for his outstanding career as 
assistant director for National Capital 
Region Training Operations at the De-
partment of Homeland Security, Fed-
eral Law Enforcement Training Cen-
ters, FLETC, in Washington, D.C. 
Mr. Cruzan has had a long distin-
guished career as a Federal, local, and 
Tribal law enforcement official. His 
law enforcement career began in 1992, 
as a reserve patrol officer with the Jop-
lin, Missouri Police Department. As he 
rose through the ranks of law enforce-
ment from police officer to criminal in-
vestigator, Mr. Cruzan’s service has al-
ways focused on the critical needs of 
Indian Country, especially law enforce-
ment training for police, corrections, 
and telecommunications officers. 
In 2017, the Secretary of the Interior 
honored Mr. Cruzan with the Depart-
ment of Interior’s Distinguished Serv-
ice Award, the highest recognition an 
employee within the Department can 
receive for his outstanding contribu-
tions. 
During his time, he has provided 
FLETC 
with 
tremendous 
executive 
leadership 
and 
management. 
Mr. 
Cruzan has dedicated his life to pro-
tecting others, and I thank him for his 
years of service. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO THE FAMILY OF 
GEORGE FLOYD 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to George 
Floyd’s family, a family that I have 
come to know even more than the time 
we spent together in Houston, Texas. 
The family grew up in my congres-
sional district, and they lived in what 
is called Cuney Homes, which stands 
today proud, as I know they are, of this 
family. And they, of course, went to 
the famous Jack Yates High School. 
Why would I pay tribute to this fam-
ily? 
Because I think America has come to 
see them as America’s family, and the 
world has come to admire them for 
their steadfastness, their passion and 
compassion, as well as their calm and 
peaceful understanding of the crisis 
and the terrible tragedy that has be-
fallen them. They have acted in gen-
erosity. They have prayed. They have 
embraced those who have come to 
honor them. They realize the symbol 
that they stand for, yet they were 
hurting—hurting and hurting. 
Thank goodness for the decision yes-
terday, the judgment, the just justice 
for them, for they are America’s fam-
ily; and their commitment is that they 
will continue to serve this country to 
bring about justice for all.

CONGRESSIONAL 
BLACK

CELEBRATES THE LIFE OF THE 
HONORABLE ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous materials on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise this evening for the Congressional 
Black Caucus’ Special Order hour, the 
CBC’s Celebration of Life of Congress-
man Alcee L. Hastings, and to echo: 
Our Power, Our Message. 
The Special Order hour is generally 
regarded as a solemn moment and gives 
the yCBC an opportunity to speak di-
rectly to the American people and to 
reflect on ideas and policies critical to 
our constituents. 
I can’t think of a better way to share 
the life and legacy of our friend and 
colleague. To his family, to Patricia, 
to his son, Alcee—or ‘‘Jody,’’ as we 
called him—to his daughter, grand-
daughters, and all watching, we say: 
Thank you for sharing Alcee with us. 
Lastly, on behalf of the 56 members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, we 
say: Thank you, Alcee, for a job well 
done. 
Because it is without a doubt I can 
tell you that Alcee left this place, the 
people’s House, better than he found it. 
All of us were enriched by his dapper 
style, his keen intellect, and his larger- 
than-life presence. You never had to 
guess what Alcee thought or believed. 
He made it clear, whether you liked it 
or not. But he was the same man on 
the United States House floor; in the 
powerful Rules Committee; or in greet-
ing foreign dignitaries under the aus-
pices of the Helsinki Commission as he 
was on the streets of Florida, where he 
served his constituents so well. 
Madam Speaker, to all gathered here 
today, I say to our brother: You will be 
sorely missed. 
We will miss his smile. We will miss 
his wise counsel. And as I look to my 
left, in that chair, where he sat faith-
fully, we salute and honor him. Alcee 
did it his way. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to yield tonight’s anchor of 
the Special Order hour paying tribute 
to a legend, to a friend, to a colleague, 
to the gentlewoman from Texas, Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
got to know Congressman Alcee Has-
tings in a very special way. Both schol-
ars, both liking to debate, both being 
very clear in their message, both mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. Oh, how great it was to watch Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE and 
Congressman Alcee Hastings take on 
an issue and mentor someone like me. 
Madam Speaker, with great pleasure 
I turn the microphone over to Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, who 
will manage the rest of the hour, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, with 
humility, gratitude, and a broken heart, I rise 
to anchor this Congressional Black Caucus 
Special Order in remembrance of Congress-
man Alcee Hastings, senior member of the 
Committee on Rules, a man who travelled the 
world leading congressional delegations to de-
fend, protect, and strengthen democracies 
while serving as Chair of the Helsinki Commis-
sion, a highly respected and valued member 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of 
this House’s greatest debaters, one of the first 
three African Americans elected to this body 
from Florida since Reconstruction, a member 
of Congress for 28 years, my mentor, a be-
loved colleague, and dear friend who died 
Tuesday, April 6, 2021, at the age of 84. 
Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings, who was 
affectionately referred to by his colleagues and 
constituents as ‘‘Judge Hastings,’’ was a 
statesman and strong supporter of equality, 
economic and social justice, civil rights, Israel, 
and human dignity for all. 
He took to heart and lived the admonition 
he received from his father as a young child’’ 
‘‘Be your own boss man,’’ who through it all 
was his own man as he blazed trails and pio-
neered paths to improve the lives and life 
chances of the was so honored to serve. 
Alcee Lamar Hastings was born September 
5, 1936, in Altamonte Springs, to Julius Has-
tings, a butler, and Mildred nee Merritt, a 
maid. 
His parents left Florida to find jobs .to earn 
money for Alcee’s education, during which 
time he was raised by his maternal grand-
mother and attended Crooms Academy in 
Sanford, Florida, which was founded for Afri-
can-American students, graduating in 1953. 
Five years later, Alcee Hastings graduated 
from Fisk University with dual majors in zool-
ogy and botany. 
Alcee Hastings started law school at How-
ard University before transferring to Florida 
Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tal-
lahassee, from which he received his law de-
gree in 1963. 
Always a fighter and foot soldier for justice, 
Alcee Hastings was involved in early civil 
rights struggles, including the famous sit-ins in 
drugstore lunch-counters in North Carolina in 
1959. 
About those times, he later said: ‘‘Those 
were the early days of the civil rights move-
ment, and the people in Walgreens were 
breaking eggs on our heads and throwing

mustard and ketchup and salt at us. We sat 
there taking all of that.’’ 
‘‘After graduating from Florida A&M law 
school, Alcee Hastings went into private prac-
tice as a civil rights lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, 
but when he first arrived a motel refused to 
rent him a room; a humiliating experience in-
flicted on African Americans whenever they 
traveled in the United States before passage 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
As a civil rights lawyer, Alcee Hastings suc-
cessfully filed lawsuits to desegregate the pub-
lic schools in Broward County, Florida, as well 
as the Cat’s Meow, a restaurant that was pop-
ular with white lawyers and judges but would 
not serve African Americans. 
It was poetic justice indeed when then Flor-
ida Governor Reuben Askew appointed Alcee 
Hastings to the circuit court of Broward County 
in 1977 and held the investiture ceremony at 
a high school he had helped desegregate. 
In 1979, Alcee Hastings was nominated by 
President Jimmy Carter to serve as United 
States District Judge on the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of Florida, 
becoming the first African American federal 
judge in Florida; he was confirmed by the U.S. 
Senate on October 31, 1979, sworn in on No-
vember 2, 1979, and served for a decade until 
leaving the bench in October 1989. 
As a judge, Alcee Hastings established his 
own style, eschewing the typical judicial mien 
of grave reserve; he cracked jokes from the 
bench, dropped slang in rulings and inter-
views, and was unflinching in his support for 
the poor and the dispossessed. 
In 1981, Judge Hastings exasperated the 
Department of Justice when he extended a 
court order blocking the deportation of 76 Hai-
tians after the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service had stepped up removals. 
Many thought that with his departure from 
the federal bench, Alcee Hastings’s career in 
public service had come to end but they un-
derestimated this irrepressible and indomitable 
human being, who never forgot the lesson 
taught him years ago by his father: ‘‘Be your 
own boss man!’’ 
So three years later, in 1992, Alcee Has-
tings ran for Congress from the newly created 
23rd Congressional District of Florida and won 
election in November of that year and, along 
with Congresswomen-elect Carrie Meek and 
Corrine Brown, became the first African Ameri-
cans elected to Congress since Reconstruc-
tion, where he would go to be a productive 
and constructive member as Dean of the Flor-
ida Congressional Delegation, Vice-Chair of 
the Committee on Rules, and Vice-Chair and 
senior member of the House Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence. 
One of the great joys of my life was serving 
with Alcee Hastings when he chaired the Hel-
sinki Commission, the Organization for Co-
operation and Security in Europe, and we trav-
eled often to distant capitals to meet with our 
counter-parts in Europe and work on ways to 
strengthen economic and political ties and 
support their democratic aspirations. 
Alcee Hastings was held in such high es-
teem by international legislators that he was 
elected the first African American president of 
the 323-member OSCE Parliamentary Assem-
bly, an institution of the Organization for Secu-
rity and Co-operation in Europe charged with 
facilitating inter-parliamentary dialogue, an im-
portant aspect of the overall effort to meet the 
challenges 
of 
democracy 
throughout 
the 
OSCE area. 
Madam Speaker, in these days of trial and 
challenge, I am reminded that our dear de-
parted colleague Alcee Hastings always coun-
seled us to remain steadfast, saying: 
‘‘Continuing to do nothing in the face of con-
tinued threats to our people and our way of 
life is hardly what the American people elected 
us to do.’’ 
Alcee Hastings, the recipient of numerous 
honors and awards bestowed on him from or-
ganizations both at home and abroad, firmly 
believed that progress and change can be 
achieved through mutual respect and appre-
ciation, and that individuals and communities 
can see beyond the limits of parochialism, en-
abling them to better understand each other. 
And we all know how proud he was to be 
a Nupe, a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Frater-
nity, Inc., and a member of the National Bar 
Association. 
Alcee Hastings’ commanding presence will 
forever be missed; we all mourn his loss and 
extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Pa-
tricia Williams; his children, Alcee Hastings II, 
Chelsea Hastings and Leigh Hastings; his 
stepdaughter, Maisha; and all the relatives 
and friends who loved him so dearly. 
My deepest sympathies go out to them, and 
I pray they find consolation in the certain 
knowledge that the Judge is now resting in the 
Heavenly Chorus. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join my colleagues in honoring 
the life and legacy of our dearly departed 
friend and colleague Congressman Alcee Has-
tings, who passed away earlier this month. 
Alcee and I were both elected to Congress 
in 1992. We were part of a historic class of 
new African American lawmakers from the 
South. Few would make such a tremendous 
and impactful mark on this institution than 
Alcee Hastings. He was one of Congress’ 
most steadfast advocates for civil and human 
rights, working families, and the most vulner-
able in our society. 
He bravely battled pancreatic cancer for the 
last year and a half. And despite this dev-
astating diagnosis, Alcee remained a powerful 
and active voice for his constituents and the 
state of Florida. 
I will miss seeing him on the House floor. I 
will miss his sharp-witted questioning in the 
House Rules Committee. I will miss his friend-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, our nation lost one of its 
most dedicated public servants. And in Alcee 
Hastings, we lost one of our most unique, 
friendly and hardest working colleagues. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his wife Patri-
cia, children, staff, constituents and many, 
many friends. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor our friend and colleague, Alcee Has-
tings—a pillar of our Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Congressman Hastings was a compas-
sionate leader who always spoke his mind and 
served his constituents with purpose. 
For nearly thirty years, he used his position 
in Congress to speak truth to power and advo-
cate for our country’s most vulnerable. 
I admired both his courage and his unique 
ability to bring reason and deep thought to the 
many conversations we had together. He was 
a friend and mentor we all respected. 
One thing I’ll never forget about Congress-
man Hastings is his wonderful sense of style, 
his fun, colorful socks, and—I have to say— 
his great taste in hats. 
And, while he will be deeply missed here in 
Congress and within our Caucus, we will carry 
on in his memory by advocating for the 
causes he dedicated his life to—supporting 
working families, communities of color, chil-
dren, immigrants and all those in need. 
His legacy as a civil rights activist, judge, 
and powerful, passionate leader in Congress 
will live on, and be a model for us all. 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Congressman Alcee Hastings. 
Congressman Hastings spent more than 30 
years in Congress and fought for racial equal-
ity during his storied and historic life. At the 
time of his passing, he was the Dean of the 
Florida Congressional delegation as the Rep-
resentative from Florida’s 20th District. Before 
that, he was Florida’s first African-American 
federal judge and a strong civil rights advo-
cate. Congressman Hastings died on April 6, 
2021 after a long bout with pancreatic cancer. 
Congressman Hastings was a life-long pub-
lic servant. He served as a Circuit Court 
Judge in Broward County, Florida and then 
became a U.S. District Court Judge for the 
Southern District of Florida. After his election 
to Congress in 1992, Congressman Hastings 
was a leading member of the Congressional 
Black Caucus and a senior Democratic whip. 
He served as a member of the House Rules 
Committee and a senior member of the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 
where he was chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations. He was an 
esteemed member of Congress throughout his 
time there. 
Personally, I am devastated at the loss of 
my colleague and mentor, the Honorable 
Alcee Hastings. We would talk about his time 
spent in Newark as a child and his fond 
memories of growing up there. While voting, I 
would spend many days sitting next to him 
and listening to the wisdom he imparted on 
me. His blunt honesty and brilliance as a leg-
islator were second to none. We even shared 
our love of colorful socks. The Lord has an-
other one of my Fathers on the Floor of Con-
gress with him no and I will miss him dearly.

April 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, tonight, with hu-
mility, gratitude and a broken heart, I 
rise to anchor this Congressional Black 
Caucus Special Order in remembrance 
of Congressman Alcee Hastings, a sen-
ior member of the Committee on Rules, 
a man who traveled the world. Most of 
all, he loved his family, he loved his 
country, he loved his State of Florida, 
loved his friends and his colleagues. We 
humble ourselves today to honor him. 
Madam Speaker, I will reserve my 
words and tribute so that I can ac-
knowledge one of his dear friends, the 
Honorable BENNIE
THOMPSON. BENNIE 
THOMPSON, the chair of the Homeland 
Security Committee, a distinguished 
gentleman from Mississippi, a fighter 
for justice himself, but as well, the op-
portunity to be able to lead this coun-
try into safety. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON), and if I might say, the gentleman 
with the white jacket as a member of 
the great Divine Nine, the Kappas. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gen-
tlewoman allowing me to talk about 
my friend, Alcee Hastings. 
Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings to a 
lot of us, is what we call a Renaissance 
man. When you knew Alcee, you knew 
somebody who knew exactly what he 
was talking about at all times. I car-
ried Alcee Hastings to the Second Dis-
trict of Mississippi a number of times. 
You know, for a Florida boy, he could 
have been a Mississippi boy. He knew 
Bobby Rush, the blues singer. He knew 
how to go to catfish fries. He could just 
about adapt to any situation. But 
Alcee Hastings, more importantly, pro-
vided significant direction and guid-
ance to a number of us who came to 
this body. 
Madam Speaker, so today I rise to 
pay a special tribute to a close and 
dear friend that I shared many memo-
ries with: The Honorable Congressman 
Alcee Hastings. 
Alcee was a champion civil rights 
legend, who served the people of Flor-
ida and this country for over 28 years 
as a Member of Congress. He dedicated 
his life to uplifting and empowering his 
constituents, colleagues, and our Na-
tion. All of us have at least one Alcee 
Hastings story. Some of us have two or 
three or more Alcee Hastings stories, 
and they all are memorable. 
All through my district, he was one 
of those individuals who people wanted 
to know what was Alcee Hastings like. 
And the only thing I can tell you is you 
have to meet him because you really 
can’t describe him. The dictionary 
doesn’t provide enough adjectives to 
give you who he is, but that is the kind 
of person Alcee Hastings was. 
To Patricia and the kids: We all miss 
him. Absolutely, I know that all of you 
will miss him, too. 
You know, I wonder what Alcee 
would be saying to us right now. I have 
a good idea. And he probably would 
say: ‘‘Look, I don’t have time for all 
that noise. Get on with the business of 
helping our people.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for those words 
of reminding us how forthright and di-
rect Alcee Hastings was. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
distinguished majority leader of the 
House, who gave an eloquent portrayal 
this morning at our celebration service 
of his relationship with Congressman 
Hastings and his understanding of Con-
gressman Hastings’ contribution and 
value to all of us. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for her service. I thank Chair-
woman BEATTY and members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus for orga-
nizing this Special Order tonight. 
Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings was 
a dear friend, a close friend, a wonder-
ful supporter, adviser, counselor, a 
friend who will be greatly missed not 
only by me, but by so many with whom 
he served on both sides of the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, he and I served to-
gether in this House for 28 years, al-
most three decades. Over the course of 
that time, I came to know him very 
well. I visited his district. I know his 
wife. I saw his passion for public serv-
ice, his sharp intellect and ability as a 
legislator, and his kindness and de-
cency as a human being. 
b 1900 
Alcee was someone who held strong 
convictions, as all of us know, and he 
would impart those to you, and he 
fought hard for what he believed in. 
One of those convictions was that all 
people on this Earth deserve the same 
basic freedoms and access to democ-
racy as Americans are privileged to 
enjoy. 
Madam Speaker, he and I served to-
gether on the U.S. Commission on Se-
curity and Cooperation in Europe, and 
Alcee later served as its chairman, as I 
once did. He was the first African 
American to lead that body. And he 
was also honored, Madam Speaker, by 
legislators from 57 different nations 
when he was chosen as president of the 
Organization on Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe’s Parliamentary Assem-
bly. The only American, the only Afri-
can American, obviously, to have had 
that honor, and the only person of Afri-
can descent to have that honor. 
Before the pandemic, Alcee traveled 
the world to promote democracy and 
human rights where they were newly 
enjoyed or not yet achieved. Wherever 
he went, he brought his deep commit-
ment to constitutionalism, rule of law, 
equality, justice, and opportunity for 
all. 
In doing so, he was an excellent 
envoy of this House of Representatives, 
the people’s House, and the democratic 
mission it embodies to the nations of 
the world. 
I want to take a moment to speak 
about a part of Alcee’s life that shows 
his true character. It is no secret that 
Alcee faced difficult and painful rebuke 
earlier in his career. I am not going to 
go into the specifics. Most people know 
the outlines. 
But what stands out, Madam Speak-
er, for me and for others more than 
anything about what happened is that 
most people, after having been through 
such an experience, might have turned 
away from public service and harbored 
a debilitating anger and self-pity. Not 
our friend Alcee Hastings. 
He was determined to continue giv-
ing back and serving his State and his 
country. So he ran for Congress and re-
ceived the imprimatur of his neighbors 
and friends and constituents as a per-
son of great worth whom they wanted 
to represent them. He served his con-
stituents faithfully and with great 
ability for 28 years and, indeed, prior to 
that as well. 
Those he served and those with whom 
he served are grateful that he made 
that choice. We are grateful that he 
persisted and persevered. And we are so 
fortunate, Madam Speaker, to have 
been blessed in our own lives by the 
wonderful life of service and contribu-
tions by Alcee Hastings. 
I join others in offering my condo-
lences to his wife, Patricia; to his fam-
ily; to his devoted staff; and to the 
communities of southern Florida he 
represented so skillfully in this House. 
Another Representative of southern 
Florida, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, will be relating 
from her personal experience serving 
with him from southern Florida the ex-
traordinary impact that he had on 
Florida and that region. 
Madam Speaker, I spoke this morn-
ing at a memorial service led, again, by 
the Congressional Black Caucus for 
Alcee, and I related the story that a 
few days before his death, I had called 
Patricia and talked to her about how 
Alcee was doing, and she said: Not well. 
Two days later, I called her back. It 
was probably 7 o’clock, about this 
time, in the evening. I said: How are 
things? 
She said: Not good. 
I said: Can I talk to him? 
She said: I don’t think he will under-
stand you and I don’t think he will be 
able to respond, but I will put the 
phone to his ear and you can say some-
thing to him. 
She did that, and I said a few words 
very briefly, and then I closed with the 
sentiment that I have today and that I 
had for most of the time that I had 
known him. I said to him: I love you, 
Alcee. 
I said this morning that I don’t know 
whether he could hear or understand 
what I said at that point in time, but 
the good news for me is I knew that he 
knew that I loved him. He was a man of 
great worth, of great feelings, of great 
expectations, of great service, of great 
vision. I will miss Alcee, my friend. 
May Alcee’s memory be a blessing 
and inspiration to us as we continue to 
work here in this institution that he 
loved and served so well. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the majority leader for that

personal tribute of the bond of love be-
tween his friend, Alcee Hastings, and 
himself. I thank him for that story and 
tribute. 
Madam Speaker, it is now an honor 
to yield to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the co- 
chair of the Florida delegation, the 
cardinal of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, but I think this evening what 
she would most want to be known as, 
certainly a mentee of earlier years, but 
a very dear friend of Congressman 
Alcee Hastings. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor one of 
the foremost fighters for justice Flor-
ida 
has 
ever 
known, Congressman 
Alcee Hastings. 
Throughout my public service, I have 
been proud to be associated with and 
stand alongside this fierce but gentle 
and courageous statesman. The shadow 
he casts in my own political life is 
long. It started at the University of 
Florida, when I ran for Student Senate 
side by side with his son, Alcee ‘‘Jody’’ 
Hastings, II. Twenty years later, I had 
the honor and pleasure of serving 
alongside his father, a man who was 
my dear friend and mentor. 
Alcee revered this institution, and he 
loved his 20th District, from Belle 
Glade to Broward, and the Sawgrass to 
Sistrunk. Anyone who knew him knew 
he was Florida through and through, 
and he brought that to these Halls of 
power. He valued every part of the cul-
tural and ethnic mosaic that enriches 
our great State, and he contributed to 
that throughout his life. 
With his passing, his constituents 
lost a brilliant, fearless, and giant- 
hearted advocate for the community he 
so dearly loved. Our folks back home 
will miss their ‘‘on his mind, on his 
tongue,’’ firebrand voice in these Halls 
of power. 
The common refrain among anyone 
unfortunate enough to follow Alcee 
Hastings on a speaking program was: 
Well, this is the last place on a pro-
gram you want to be. 
He was a powerful, impactful orator. 
Here in Congress, as you all know too 
well, each of us lost a wise, patient, 
and humane statesman; and our delega-
tion lost a seasoned, thoughtful, force-
ful leader. 
Personally, I lost a treasured friend 
and trusted teacher. I can’t count the 
times I leaned on him for his honest, 
perceptive counsel. Even when I didn’t 
know I needed that advice, Alcee did, 
and he provided it generously. After-
wards, I was always grateful for his 
words of wisdom. 
Alcee Hastings devoted his life to 
righting the world’s wrong. He cham-
pioned the most vulnerable, and he 
himself knew what it meant to over-
come. He fought for human rights at 
home and abroad. Alcee was a cham-
pion of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and 
a steadfast friend to the Jewish com-
munity. He knew that Jews and Afri-
can Americans were much more alike 
than we were different, and we often 
joked about the similarities. 
Years 
ago, 
as 
police 
brutality 
stretched the fabric holding our com-
munity together, he and I joined to-
gether to ensure that law enforcement 
and our people would be able to pledge 
to protect one another and had a safe 
forum to communicate. 
When it came to protecting the 
world’s most unique tropical wetlands, 
Alcee always spearheaded our Ever-
glades restoration efforts. In just the 
last month, he led the delegation in a 
letter to the President advocating for 
record-level funding. Even on battles 
dearer to me, he poured his own heart 
in it. 
Alcee was one of my most fierce al-
lies in battling breast cancer. These 
last 10 months, I spoke to him almost 
every day. It was an honor to cast his 
proxy vote. Good days or bad, he made 
sure he personally told me his vote 
preferences. Some days he might say in 
his Alcee kind of way: Why are we even 
voting on this? 
And I left out some of the choicer 
words. 
I cherished catching up with him 
every opportunity. Other days, he 
would just share his vote, and that call 
would end far too quickly. No matter 
how he felt, he always ended those 
calls by saying: ‘‘DEBBIE, thank you for 
this.’’ 
He 
was 
always 
gracious, 
always 
grateful. But it was I who was grateful 
for the gift of this man. 
I was also so proud to swear him into 
this 117th Congress. He took what he 
must have known was his final oath 
with such pride, dignity, and author-
ity. 
In our last conversation, he told me 
he was at peace. 
And why shouldn’t he be? 
He rose from a young man in the or-
ange groves of the segregated South to 
become 
the 
first 
African-American 
Federal jurist in Florida and part of a 
historic 1992 class of the United States 
Congress. His political life took him as 
far off as the Parliamentary Assembly 
in Europe. 
Congressman Hastings did it his way, 
and he leaves an immense personal and 
political legacy, both in these Halls 
and in our hearts. I know that I and 
this hallowed body are better off from 
having been in Alcee’s midst. And that 
lasting impression he left behind, we 
will always carry with us. May his 
memory be for a blessing. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is certainly a privilege as well. 
I thank Congresswoman WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ for the personal stories she 
has shared with us, and her friendship. 
Madam Speaker, it is now my privi-
lege to yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), known as an ex-
pert on all things agricultural; a civil 
rights leader; as well in this place, in 
this House, a cardinal himself. But I 
believe what he will share with us to-
night is a personal relationship with 
Congressman Alcee Hastings, a Kappa. 
And, yes, Congressman BISHOP
is a 
Kappa. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Shakespeare wrote: All the world is a 
stage. And all the men and women, 
merely players. Each has his entrance 
and his exit. One man in his time may 
play many parts. 
So it was with our beloved Alcee Has-
tings. He was a son, father, grand-
father, husband, civil rights activist, 
attorney, judge, Member of Congress, 
international 
parliamentarian, 
col-
league, my brother in Kappa Alpha Psi 
fraternity, a faithful friend, and a fear-
less foe. 
His performance in each of these 
roles was always par excellence. His 
was a life well-lived. He was authentic, 
brutally frank, but always a powerful 
advocate for marginalized humanity. 
He did so much for so many for so long. 
We will miss him, but the world is a 
better place because of the life of Alcee 
Lamar Hastings. 
My wife, Vivian, and I send our 
heartfelt condolences to his wife, Pa-
tricia, his other family, his staff, and 
all who mourn his loss. 
b 1915 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman BISHOP for let-
ting us know that the world is a better 
place because of Alcee Hastings. 
Now it is my privilege again to intro-
duce another of Congressman Hastings’ 
dear, dear friends, the chairwoman of 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee as well as a proud member 
of the Divine Nine and a great Texan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON). 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I simply cannot eulogize the 
life and legacy of Congressman Has-
tings every single minute, but I will 
try my best. 
Alcee and I came to Congress to-
gether in the class of 1992, and almost 
instantly I knew that I was in the pres-
ence of a giant. 
Our class doubled the size of the CBC. 
Alcee let everyone know that he 
came from humble beginnings. But I 
can say this: he carved for himself a 
path to success first in the field of law 
and ultimately in Congress. 
As many have already noted, he was 
a man of sharp words, and perhaps 
sharp is an understatement. 
Who could forget his infamous dec-
laration that Texas is a crazy State? 
We shared so many laughs and quiet 
whispers. A story that many may not 
know is that I convinced him to come 
to Texas and speak in our crazy State, 
to which he responded, ‘‘Y’all may 
want to hear me speak now, but after 
I’m done, you won’t ever invite me 
back.’’ 
Well, it was colorful. 
Alcee and I cofounded the Congres-
sional Homeless Caucus and served as 
co-chairs together until his passing. 
Because of his tireless advocacy on be-
half of the homeless, more constituents 
in his district and mine and across the

country now sleep with a roof above 
their heads. 
His wife and I were close, and we 
shared many social occasions together. 
So I say: So long my dear friend, rest 
in peace. And kudos from the 30th Dis-
trict of Texas based in Dallas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Texas 
for her recognition of Alcee’s com-
plimentary words about Texas, but he 
was still our friend. I thank Congress-
woman JOHNSON for that tribute. 
Again, this is a very special tribute, 
and I might say special, special tribute 
to our friend, the late Alcee Lamar 
Hastings. 
To provide another tribute is one of 
our members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, a member of the leader-
ship of the cochair of the Democratic 
Policy and Steering Committee, a car-
dinal 
on 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee, and it is known that often peo-
ple say: BARBARA LEE speaks for me. 
The Honorable Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE is from California, a State 
that loves Texas as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE for yielding. I also was born 
and raised in El Paso, Texas, so I thank 
my sister. 
Let me say tonight that I rise to cel-
ebrate the remarkable life of our dear 
friend, a dedicated public servant and a 
warrior for justice, the Honorable—he 
truly was the Honorable—Alcee Has-
tings. 
I thank Congresswoman BEATTY for 
organizing this Special Order to honor 
our friend this evening. 
I would like to offer my deepest con-
dolences 
to 
Congressman 
Hastings’ 
family; his wife, Patricia; his staff; all 
of his loved ones; his children; and his 
grandchildren. I know that this loss is 
deeply felt, and I am praying for the 
Hastings family and also for his con-
stituents whom I had the honor to 
meet during my visits to his district. 
Congressman Hastings was a trail-
blazer, and he lived a life of firsts as 
the 
first 
African-American 
Federal 
judge appointed to the State of Florida 
and the first African American to lead 
the Helsinki Commission. 
I have had the privilege to travel 
with Alcee to Europe several times and 
to work with him to establish a trans-
atlantic dialogue to improve social and 
political inclusion of people of African 
descent in Europe and the United 
States. This was a visionary idea that 
Congressman Hastings wanted to see 
happen in his lifetime, and he has made 
so much progress toward achieving 
that goal and his dream. 
Alcee’s political and diplomatic acu-
men was strengthened by his very 
warm and caring spirit. Many may not 
be aware, but while he was fighting the 
fight for human rights and democracy, 
he was also a devoted caregiver to his 
ailing mother. When I was struggling 
with the health challenges of my own 
beloved mother, he was there to offer 
comfort and guidance. He made me re-
alize how blessed I was to be able to 
take care of her during her last years 
on Earth. For that I will be deeply 
grateful. 
When I first met Judge Hastings back 
in the 1980s, even before I was an elect-
ed official, I knew I had met someone 
special. He gave me his honest opinion 
and offered guidance without hesi-
tation even before I was elected to of-
fice. 
Despite his no-nonsense attitude and 
direct nature, myself, like all of us, 
had our own inside jokes. He called me 
Bob. I loved his socks—like so many of 
us—so much so that he gave me six 
pairs for my birthday. They are my 
Alcee socks which I will always cherish 
and wear. 
Congressman Hastings always sup-
ported and guided me when I presented 
my bills to the Rules Committee, and 
he encouraged me by always saying: 
‘‘I’m with you, Bob. I’m with you, 
Bob.’’ Even if he disagreed with my 
progressive bills, he would say: ‘‘I’m 
with you, Bob. I’m with you, Bob. We 
are going to get this out.’’ 
He taught me some colorful words to 
use during very challenging times. 
I feel beyond blessed to have known 
Alcee Hastings. His loss will be felt not 
only 
in 
Florida, 
in 
his 
district, 
throughout the country and here in 
Washington, D.C., but also around the 
world. He was truly a beloved and bril-
liant world leader. 
I am reminded of 2 Timothy 4:7. I am 
reminded of Alcee tonight as I think 
about and read this Scripture: ‘‘I have 
fought the good fight, I have finished 
the race, I have kept the faith.’’ 
Yes, our brother, our friend, our col-
league, our warrior for justice and for 
peace fought the good fight, and now 
may he rest in peace and may he rest 
in power. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman JACKSON LEE for yielding and 
for this Special Order tonight. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. We will be re-
minded of those colorful socks. That 
was his trademark, and that is very 
special. This is a special tribute to 
Congressman Alcee Hastings. 
Our next tribute presenter is GWEN 
MOORE from the great State of Wis-
consin. GWEN MOORE has been a fighter 
for the vulnerable and serves on the 
distinguished and powerful Ways and 
Means Committee. I thank my col-
league and friend on the Helsinki Com-
mission. 
Madam Speaker, may I ask how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 25 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas for yielding, and I want to 
thank the chairwoman of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus for pulling this all 
together. 
I am GWEN MOORE from the great 
State of Wisconsin, and I was first 
elected in 2005. I was so excited about 
becoming a Member of Congress and es-
pecially excited about becoming a 
member of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Every year the Congressional Black 
Caucus Foundation hosts a great gala, 
and I was eager in September of 2005 to 
march across the stage with the likes 
of John Lewis, BARBARA LEE, and MAX-
INE WATERS with my brand new class-
mates, CLEAVER, G.K. BUTTERFIELD, AL 
GREEN, and Senator Obama. I was 
ready for the pageantry. All my rel-
atives were coming to see me curtsy in 
my African outfit made with red and 
gold African wedding cloth. But then I 
learned that all but one member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus would suit 
up. Then when I discovered that, I com-
missioned myself to implore him not to 
ruin the evening with his recalcitrance. 
Mr. Alcee Lamar Hastings’ prompt 
and declarative declination was pep-
pered 
with 
his 
famous 
street 
vernacular. Even though he was disin-
terested in the pomp and ceremony of 
the CBCF gala, he attended CBC meet-
ings regularly. His excellent judgment, 
powers of discernment, and strategic 
thinking silenced the room every time 
and had Members on the edge of their 
seats as he weighed in on tactics and 
strategy. 
I wondered: Where in the world did 
this man get his confidence that he ex-
hibited on a daily basis? 
Where did he get the courage? 
His swagger was more than just his 
socks and his tie. There was something 
that I wanted to know about him. 
Well, fortunately for me, Mr. Has-
tings drew me in as a mentee. He was 
familiar with my legislative agenda 
around equity and justice for women 
and people of color. So he invited me to 
accompany him in 2006 to the annual 
session of the Organization for Secu-
rity and Co-operation in Europe, held 
in Brussels that year, wherein he was 
serving his third term as parliamen-
tary assembly president of the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe. 
He was first elected in 2004. You have 
heard from other speakers, Madam 
Speaker, that this is an international 
organization of 57 member countries, 
and he is the only person of African de-
scent to ever hold this position and he 
is the only American to ever hold this 
position. He would have to whip and 
get votes and everything, and Alcee did 
that. 
When I saw him, I was stunned to 
witness on this international stage the 
mastery of his indefatigable leadership. 
He 
commandeered 
the 
agenda 
on 
human rights to take a deeper dive 
into minority rights, and not just 
Black versus White, but Jews and other 
ethnic minorities, gypsies, women, and 
migrants. 
In fact, under his leadership the 
OSCE broadened its mandate to ad-
dress human rights to include intoler-
ance, migration, and organized crime.

April 21, 2021 
The global consensus around the 
plight of Blacks at the hands of police 
was a topic of this international body. 
Indeed, I learned that racial oppression 
was global, and Alcee shepherded this 
international body through dozens and 
dozens of resolutions around global ra-
cial equity. 
I was hooked. I went with Alcee 
every time. What I found is that lan-
guage was not a barrier, culture was 
not a barrier, and even adversarial re-
lationships with people like the Rus-
sians or some of the other known dic-
tators who attended the meetings did 
not prevent him from engaging them in 
side meetings to advance the inter-
national dialogue. 
Because of my association with Mr. 
Hastings, I have met around 300 parlia-
mentarians of African descent in Eu-
rope, Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, 
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, 
and Canada just to name a few. 
The last trip I took with Mr. Has-
tings—we all knew it was his last 
trip—we went to London, and we gath-
ered in a circle with parliamentarians 
from Britain. We talked about the his-
toric relationship of the United States 
and Britain, and indeed that same con-
nection that BARBARA LEE referred to, 
he made us promise to continue the At-
lantic engagement with our brethren. 
We have to keep that promise to him 
because he gave birth to those relation-
ships over 30 years. 
b 1930 
Do you know what? I figured out 
where he got his swagger from. He was 
not concerned with little things and 
petty things, what people thought, and 
pomp and circumstance. 
He was a universal human rights 
leader. When I thought about him, I 
don’t know why I thought of this song 
that I first heard Sarah Vaughan sing-
ing. But some of the lyrics in ‘‘Uni-
versal Prisoner’’ were: 
Most people go around thinking they’re free 
Believing it’s an easy way to be 
They run in guilt and fear 
From all the things they truly hold dear 
The question is asked, do you give the love 
that is inside 
Or do you run to the phony world where 
most people hide? 
Mr. Hastings embodied the universal 
precepts of equality, equity, and jus-
tice. He was a true humanitarian. 
Enjoy your flight into the universe, 
Mr. Hastings. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin for her kind words. Those 
were memorable times, and the his-
toric nature of his leadership was not 
only national; it was international. 
I am privileged again in this very 
special tribute to be able to yield to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia. States 
are quite close to each other, and of 
course, her passion matches the deep 
passion of Congressman Alcee Has-
tings. That is the obvious reason for 
her kinship to Congressman Hastings, 
but also the ability to have suffered in 
loss but stand up to fight for justice, 
and that is our friend and colleague, 
LUCY MCBATH, from Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in celebration 
of the remarkable life of our dear 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
Alcee Hastings, known affectionately 
as The Judge. People called him that 
long before I got here. He was the first 
African-American Federal judge in the 
State of Florida, appointed by Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter, where he served 
for 10 years before being elected to 
Congress in 1992. 
I know that a lot of my colleagues 
and persons in this great Chamber to-
night might wonder what kind of a re-
lationship I would have had with Alcee 
Hastings. I would have only been here 
for 2 years. But what I do know is that 
I recognize Alcee truly from his spirit. 
He and I both had cancer. I was a 
cancer survivor, and oftentimes, here 
on the floor, every single day, I would 
come to his side and sit next to him, 
and I would say: ‘‘How are you doing 
today?’’ 
He would say: ‘‘Not so good today,’’ 
or he would say: ‘‘Today is a great 
day.’’ 
But I remember his kindness, and I 
remember his words of wisdom to me, 
always telling me: ‘‘You are doing the 
right thing. You are standing up. Stay 
strong. Look forward.’’ 
I am really grateful for even that 1 
year that I had to stand and to serve 
with a giant such as Alcee Hastings. 
Alcee and I were both very proud to 
serve in the House together as fellow 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. We talked about it, and often-
times, I said to him: ‘‘I still can’t be-
lieve I am here. I cannot believe I am 
here, but I am so grateful to be here to 
serve with you.’’ 
As I said, we were also bonded over 
our shared kinship as cancer patients 
because I understood what he was 
going through. I understood the treat-
ment and the pain and the suffering. 
But what I admired about him the 
most is his tenacity, his strength, and 
his fortitude to come here every single 
day in spite of it and to push his way 
through for the sake of this Chamber, 
for the sake of this body, for the sake 
of the people who he loved so dearly in 
his community. 
He offered me encouragement, telling 
me to stay the course and to continue 
to work on behalf of the American peo-
ple. I remember he said to me: ‘‘I may 
not be here when you pass that gun 
bill, but you must pass it.’’ 
I will always be grateful to him for 
his friendship and for the wisdom and 
leadership that he shared with this 
body and with me. 
I always find that I am so grateful to 
be in this body, to be among some of 
the most wise, intelligent, compas-
sionate, and driven people I have ever 
met in my life, particularly those of 
the Congressional Black Caucus like 
Alcee Hastings, a giant among us. 
Madam Speaker, I am so grateful 
today to be able to stand here and pay 
reverence to him, the giant among us. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for that sense 
of kinship, with her tribute and a ref-
erence to his kindness and his wisdom. 
I hope everyone knows that we are 
telling 
a 
very 
special 
story 
this 
evening. To join us in that is a Flo-
ridian. I always like to pronounce it in 
a way that indicates the bonding of 
Floridians, but, certainly, Floridians of 
a certain kind, like Alcee Hastings 
with the distinguished former chief of 
police, VAL DEMINGS, a senior member 
of the Intelligence Committee, a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee and 
Homeland Security Committee, and a 
Floridian with deep roots and a friend 
of Congressman Hastings. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Congress-
man Alcee Hastings. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once 
said: ‘‘The ultimate measure of a man 
is not where he stands in moments of 
convenience and comfort, but where he 
stands at times of challenge and con-
troversy.’’ 
Madam Speaker, what we all know in 
this Chamber is that Congressman 
Alcee Hastings was never afraid to 
stand during times of challenge and 
controversy. You see, Congressman 
Hastings was born in central Florida in 
Altamonte Springs. He was always so 
proud to share his stories with me 
about growing up in a city not far from 
the district I now represent. 
Alcee Hastings was a giant in our 
State, the dean of the delegation. When 
I think about what it meant for Alcee, 
being the dean was a lot more than 
being the longest serving Member. 
Alcee Hastings was a giant of a man 
in Florida, but he was a giant of a man 
around the Nation and a giant of a man 
in our world. 
As you have heard, he was the first 
Black person, period, man or woman, 
appointed as a Federal judge in Flor-
ida. We all know the joys and the pain 
of being a first and paving the way for 
others to follow, paving the way for 
other boys and girls and men and 
women, regardless of the color of their 
skin, paving the way for them as a 
first. 
I remembered that appointment. I 
was working at the Orlando Police De-
partment, and I was so proud to know 
of this giant of a man who was ap-
pointed as the first Black man to serve 
as a Federal judge. We were all so 
proud of him. 
One of the things I most appreciated 
about Congressman Hastings, my col-
league from Florida—and hear me 
clearly, there were many things that I 
loved and appreciated about him. But

one of the things was that he was big 
enough to share his space with you re-
gardless of whether you were a fresh-
man or you had been here for a consid-
erable amount of time. Congressman 
Hastings never hesitated to share his 
space with you. He never hesitated to 
give advice. He never hesitated to men-
tor, and he genuinely wanted you to do 
well. 
Congressman Hastings was a true 
friend, and it didn’t matter if he agreed 
with everything you said. He didn’t 
have to. If you were his friend, he un-
derstood that friends didn’t always 
agree on everything because, see, Alcee 
was his own man. We heard the song 
earlier today, and he did it his way. 
He was his own man with his own be-
liefs, his own principles. He allowed me 
to be my own woman with my own be-
liefs. He allowed all of us, in our re-
spective places. That is the kind of 
man, the giant of a man, that he was. 
Congressman Hastings didn’t waste a 
lot of time fighting over trivial mat-
ters. He was on a mission. He was fight-
ing for justice. I really can’t remember 
a time he was not fighting for justice. 
He didn’t mind fighting for women’s 
rights even after he had made it him-
self. He didn’t mind fighting for equal 
rights. He didn’t mind fighting for 
human rights. He didn’t mind fighting 
for the LGBTQ community. He didn’t 
mind standing up and fighting for peo-
ple who were different from him. 
Congressman Hastings dedicated his 
life to fighting for a better Florida and, 
therefore, fighting for a better Nation. 
I say to my colleagues that if you 
were in a fight, you wanted Congress-
man Hastings on your side. Madam 
Speaker, as we know, someone will 
take his space, but I don’t believe that 
anyone can ever take his place. 
I would like to close with just a short 
scripture from Psalm 56 that says: ‘‘In 
God I trust; I will not be afraid. What 
can man do to me? I am under vows to 
You, O God; I will present my thank of-
ferings to You. For You have delivered 
me from . . . stumbling, that I may 
walk before God in the light of life.’’ 
Congressman 
Hastings 
was 
not 
afraid, and we are forever grateful for 
his life well lived. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. We are truly 
grateful for his life. 
Madam Speaker, how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 4 minutes re-
maining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I will bring this Special Order to a 
close, and I want to remind our col-
leagues of this very special Special 
Order 
led 
by 
Chairwoman 
JOYCE 
BEATTY. Then, we heard from DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, SANFORD BISHOP, 
BENNIE
THOMPSON, 
EDDIE
BERNICE 
JOHNSON, our Majority Leader HOYER, 
BARBARA LEE, and GWEN MOORE. We 
heard from LUCY
MCBATH
and VAL 
DEMINGS, and we heard from others in 
their voices throughout the day and in 
their statements. 
b 1945 
So let me try to summarize this life. 
This giant of a man was a Federal 
judge and a tireless fighter for justice 
and equality. He was the dean of the 
Florida delegation. He led an inter-
national organization never before led 
by an American, never before led by an 
African American. 
But let me tell you what I believe 
really meant something to Alcee’s life. 
First, his beautiful wife, Patricia, and 
all of his family members who we pay 
tribute to for sharing him with us. But 
he was a Florida A&M man. He was a 
Fisk man. All over the country, I 
would hear Fiskites saying: ‘‘Alcee 
Hastings went to Fisk.’’ And Alcee 
Hastings would let you know he went 
Fisk University. He honored that uni-
versity, and they honored him. 
As a member of the National Bar As-
sociation myself, that is where I got to 
know Alcee Hastings. Oh, as a little, 
small pip of a lawyer myself, I looked 
up to Alcee Hastings and the words 
that he would say. In his own organiza-
tion, he would be a guest speaker, a 
civil rights lawyer, as well as a civil 
rights fighter. 
Yes, Alcee Hastings was born to a 
butler and a maid who left the South 
so that they could get money for him 
to go to school. And his dad said to 
him: ‘‘Be your own boss.’’ 
As I said, he ultimately went on to 
law school. But he also sat at the sit- 
in counters: Walgreens, where the indi-
viduals put ketchup and smashed eggs 
on him. Oh, Alcee could have turned 
around with vengeance, but he under-
stood the message of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., that violence begets nothing, 
and he peacefully sat. But that didn’t 
mean that he was going to allow them 
to get the best of Alcee Hastings. 
He went on to be a civil rights law-
yer. He went on to file lawsuits and de-
segregate the schools and the Cat’s 
Meow restaurant that he had gone to. 
Wasn’t it poetic justice when he was 
named a circuit court judge and the in-
vestiture ceremony was at the high 
school that he had helped desegregate? 
Yes, he was a Federal judge. Yes, of 
course, he did great things. He stopped 
the deportation of 76 Haitians, when 
they thought they were gone. 
Then, in 1992, he made history again, 
becoming one of the first African 
Americans coming up to this great 
body from Florida since Reconstruc-
tion, joining Corrine Brown and Carrie 
Meek. 
The Helsinki Commission was a spe-
cial love for him. Can you imagine an 
international organization led for the 
first time—they had to vote for him. 
And that was a place where they raised 
up the issue of slavery. They raised up 
reparations. They raised up human 
rights. They raised up stopping hatred 
around the world. Alcee set that tone. 
Then, of course, he continued to 
counsel, even in these times. I would 
come to him. LUCY MCBATH reminded 
me, as a cancer survivor, you would al-
ways check on him. But I tell you, he 
would walk in with those socks and 
those suits, and he would be having a 
pep in his step. 
But let me leave you with this: Con-
tinuing to do nothing in the face of 
continued threats to our people and 
our way of life is hardly what America 
elected us to do. 
So as I close, let me simply say: 
Deepest sympathy. But let me remind 
his family that those who die in the 
Lord—and I paraphrase—they will, in 
fact, rest from their labor, but their 
deeds will follow them. Alcee Hastings’ 
deeds will follow him. A tribute to 
America, a Floridian, a son, and a 
great man, both of this Nation and as a 
freedom fighter.

which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material

There was no objection.

THE BIDEN BORDER CRISIS AND 
SO-CALLED

PLAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) for 60 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, during my Special Order to-
night, my colleagues and I will address 
the inaction by the Biden administra-
tion and House Democrats to address 
this major crisis that we see on our 
southern border, this humanitarian cri-
sis. And, yes, that is the right word. It 
is a crisis by any objective measure. 
We are also going to address tonight 
the President’s so-called infrastructure 
plan. That is a lot for us to talk about. 
So we will squeeze it into this hour. 
When President Biden was inaugu-
rated, the American people will re-
member, Madam Speaker, that he 
called for unity. He promised to work 
across the aisle, to work with Repub-
licans in Congress. But so far those 
words have been completely empty 
promises. 
Everyone can acknowledge and ev-
eryone can see on television that there 
is a real crisis at the southern border,

April 21, 2021 
and it is a crisis of the administra-
tion’s creation. 
President Biden has stopped con-
struction of the border wall. He re-
implemented the catch-and-release pol-
icy of the Obama administration. He 
reversed the remain in Mexico policy of 
the Trump administration. And he se-
lectively 
is 
enforcing 
immigration 
laws. 
The results are not surprising. Our 
Border Patrol is now completely over-
whelmed, and the southwest border en-
counters have reached a 15-year high. I 
want you to look at these numbers, 
Madam Speaker. This is the border cri-
sis. The first column here is January of 
this year. We had 78,323 southwest bor-
der encounters. The next month, in 
February, it goes up to 100,441. Last 
month, in March, it was 171,700. This is 
a crisis. We all know the numbers for 
April are going to be staggering. 
I know that there are Members on 
both sides of the aisle here—I know 
there are Members, our Democrat col-
leagues, who want to join us to take 
action to fix this. But we can’t do it 
without the administration. 
Look, here are five simple steps that 
we can take that would help end the 
border crisis: 
Number one, finish the wall; 
Number two, reinstate the remain in 
Mexico policy; 
Number three, turn away high-risk 
individuals at our border. These are 
dangerous folks, some of them, coming 
across, and we know that. 
Number four, require negative COVID 
tests before releasing migrants, illegal 
immigrants, into the U.S.; 
Number five, let’s send a clear mes-
sage to the whole world to discourage 
illegal immigration. 
What a concept. These aren’t dif-
ficult things. The Trump administra-
tion had it all figured out, but now pol-
itics has gotten in the way of good pol-
icy. 
In addition to finally solving the bor-
der crisis, there is another item in the 
news that Americans desperately want 
us to address, and that is the need for 
an infrastructure package. That could 
be a bipartisan solution that we could 
all work on together. It should be non-
partisan, but because it impacts every 
single congressional district in every 
State, all of us, every American, wants 
this to happen. 
But the plan that the White House 
introduced isn’t really about infra-
structure at all. In fact, only 6 percent 
of the $2.5 trillion proposal would go 
towards bridges, highways, and roads. 
The rest goes to fund Democrat Big 
Government priorities, like the Green 
New Deal, and payoffs to liberal special 
interest groups. What an outrage. 
The facts are that the House major-
ity is the slimmest of any House ma-
jority since World War II, and the Sen-
ate is divided 50/50. Given these facts, 
we just want our Democratic col-
leagues and President Biden to end this 
partisan agenda for the sake of the 
American people. 
I look forward, Madam Speaker, to 
hearing from my Republican colleagues 
tonight about both of these issues. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), who represents the Sixth 
Congressional District of Wisconsin. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address the Chair with 
regard to the upcoming infrastructure 
bill. I am going to talk about some 
numbers. I don’t mean to bore you with 
numbers. 
When you put together a bill, you 
don’t want to be an outlier. I am going 
to address two areas in which I think 
this bill makes this an outlier in very, 
very serious ways. 
The first one is, you have changes in 
the tax law. And when you look at the 
taxes that a business pays in this coun-
try, a corporation, you have to look at 
kind of a double taxation. They will 
tax you at a corporate rate when the 
business earns the money; and when 
the business gives the money to its 
shareholders, you will be taxed at a 
dividend rate. 
There is a graph here comparing all 
of the OECD countries around the 
world as to where they stand on this 
combined tax rate. The lowest coun-
tries, the Baltic countries, Latvia and 
Estonia, are 20 percent. 
Right now, the United States, even 
after the last tax cut, at 47 percent, is 
middle of the pack. Actually, a little 
bit higher. If the tax hikes are put in 
effect that are published right now, 
you are going up to 62.7 percent. In 
other words, of the over 20 countries 
here, the United States will have the 
highest combined dividend, plus cor-
porate tax rate. That is an outlier and 
a dangerous place to be an outlier. 
There are a lot of things that go into 
a decision as to where you put a manu-
facturing facility, but taxes is cer-
tainly one of them. And given one of 
our goals should be to bring manufac-
turing back to the country, it is a bad 
place to be as the highest combined 
corporate tax rate, plus dividends. 
The next area I am going to address 
is the money supply. To a certain ex-
tent, because of previous bills passed 
during the COVID crisis, we have had a 
rather dramatic increase in the money 
supply. 
I would suggest you google ‘‘M1.’’ 
You will see that, in the last 6 months, 
the amount of dollars floating around 
has gone through the roof. Some peo-
ple, including me, would say M2 would 
be a better measurement. But even if 
you look at M2, we have a 27 percent 
increase in the money supply over the 
past year. That is just screaming we 
are going to have a lot of inflation in 
the very near future. 
It is certainly not the only reason, 
but we already see the rapid increase in 
the cost of housing construction. We 
see an increase in food prices and an in-
crease in energy prices. This is given 
what we have already done. 
Now, you are going to tell us—or 
some people are going to say that we 
are going to raise enough taxes to pay 
for this spending. But we are going to 
be raising enough taxes over the next 
10 or 15 years. We know around here 
that when we say we are going to make 
a pay-for the next 10 or 15 years, a lot 
of times that pay-for never material-
izes. 
So I am afraid we are going to have 
another big increase in the money sup-
ply when we have already had a 27 per-
cent increase in the last year, and this 
is going to come back and cause seri-
ous concern. I beg the majority to look 
at a graph of the combined tax rates, 
us compared to the other OECD coun-
tries, and I beg them to look at the 
money supply and don’t make us any 
more of an outlier on either. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Wisconsin for that dire warning. I 
guess if you subscribe to modern mone-
tary theory, none of this is a concern, 
but it is for those of us who live in the 
real world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. FALLON), who 
represents the Fourth Congressional 
District of Texas. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden infrastructure plan is another 
classic example of the old bait-and- 
switch. Much like the COVID relief 
bill, where only 9 percent of the $1.9 
trillion price tag actually went to 
COVID relief, this plan has very little 
to do with infrastructure. 
The definition of the word in the 
Cambridge Dictionary is: The basic 
system and services, such as transport 
and power supplies, that a country or 
organization uses in order to work ef-
fectively. 
So we know what it really means: 
roads, bridges; and, in the 21st century, 
broadband internet would qualify. 
How much of the $2.2 trillion is actu-
ally going to infrastructure? 
$115 billion is set aside for bridges, 
roads, and highways; just 5 percent. 
And under a more broad definition, if 
we include public transportation and 
broadband, the total grows to $405 bil-
lion, which is still just 18 percent of 
the new spending. 
So where does the other 82 percent 
go? 
Democrats across the country have 
said their definition of infrastructure 
includes universal pre-K, climate ac-
tion, climate justice, eradicating right- 
to-work environments, caregiving, af-
fordable 
housing, 
police 
account-
ability, and paid leave. 
This ain’t infrastructure. 
So we all know what this is: The 
largest corporate welfare slush fund in 
American history. 
Joe Biden will have virtual carte 
blanche to nepotistically dole out hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to curry 
favor with allies, supporters, friends, 
and family. 
This isn’t the hallmark of innova-
tion, but it will ensure that the D.C. 
swamp continues to be a festering pool 
of corruption.

b 2000 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentleman from Texas. 
We came here to drain the swamp, 
but it is really difficult during the cur-
rent administration. We will get back 
to it soon, though, I am confident of 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), who 
represents the Fifth District. 
Mr. LATTA. I thank my friend for 
yielding and hosting tonight’s Special 
Order. 
Quite a few of us have gone down to 
the border in the last several weeks, 
and, Madam Speaker, we do have a cri-
sis at the border. When I say, a crisis, 
I mean an unmitigated crisis at the 
border. 
We were at McAllen and going in to 
see the border crossing that night and 
the people streaming across, the Bor-
der Patrol was probably going to proc-
ess over a thousand people that night. 
A thousand people. 
The next morning, we were able to go 
to the Donna facility. And the Donna 
facility, the best way to describe it, it 
is a canvas building, you might say, a 
very nice building. It has air condi-
tioning and all, but it was only built to 
hold 250 people. The day we were there, 
there were 3,500 people being housed 
there, the vast majority being kids. 
We went into the pods they have. 
These pods are only supposed to hold 33 
children. One held 412. Another had 450. 
And the week before there were over 
600 in one. 
There is a problem; it is a crisis. But 
it is not being seen as a crisis down at 
the White House. I implore the Presi-
dent and the Vice President to go down 
there and see what is happening. It is 
absolutely 
essential, 
because 
these 
children that are being held there, ac-
cording to what they say, they are sup-
posed to only be there for 72 hours. 
Some are being held for 3 weeks. One 
little girl was there for over 28 days. 
So we do have a crisis at the border. 
It has got to be noted, and the Presi-
dent and Vice President have to know 
it. It is absolutely essential. 
Let me just finish with this: The 
other thing that is happening, when 
you take 40 percent of our Border Pa-
trol offline and put them into the fa-
cilities and also in processing, we have 
got drugs flowing across the border. 
Last year we had 88,000 people in this 
country die of overdoses. That is going 
up exponentially. 
So let’s get something done down 
there, Mr. President. It is essential. We 
have got to do it today. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
my friend for that compelling eye-
witness account. Anyone who is look-
ing at the evidence cannot deny this is 
a problem. 
I would like to yield to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Being from a border State, she knows a 
whole lot about this. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, there 
is a border crisis. Let’s just face it. 
President Biden even slipped over the 
weekend and said it was a crisis. Then 
the White House had to pull it back. 
When thousands of people are crossing 
the border each and every day, it is a 
humanitarian crisis, it is a health cri-
sis, and it is a national security crisis 
because we now know that at least a 
couple of the people that they caught 
were on the terrorist watch list. 
Just yesterday, the Governor of Ari-
zona declared a State emergency and 
sent National Guard to help our law 
enforcement in our border commu-
nities. You know what the Customs 
and Border Patrol did under the Biden 
administration? They dropped off 16 
people, including kids, in the middle of 
a park in a small community 80 miles 
north of the border, Gila Bend, Ari-
zona. 
They don’t have a shelter; they don’t 
have a hospital there. They have noth-
ing. The mayor and his wife had to bor-
row a van to transport these people to 
a Phoenix shelter. Now, what kind of 
President does that? 
If this happened, if these unaccom-
panied children were just left to be 
handled by cartels, by a U.S. citizen, 
that U.S. citizen would be charged with 
child abuse and be in prison right now. 
This is unconscionable, and it needs to 
stop now. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentlewoman for that passion. She 
is right, she has been there, and she 
sees it herself. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. NEHLS), who represents the 22nd 
Congressional District and will bring 
another border State perspective. He 
also knows a lot about law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, for 
weeks now our country has witnessed 
the never-ending horrific images and 
stories from our southern border. We 
have heard from Border Patrol that 
they don’t have enough agents to se-
cure the southern border and babysit— 
yes, babysit—the tens of thousands of 
migrant children flooding across our 
southern border. As a result, criminal 
illegal aliens are slipping through un-
detected. 
We are a nation of laws and law and 
order, or at least we used to be. Ever 
since this current administration as-
sumed control of the White House, 
there has been an outright refusal— 
yes, refusal—to put the American peo-
ple first and address the crisis at our 
southern border. 
The administration’s inactions will 
cost American lives, will cost billions 
of taxpayer dollars, and once again put 
the responsibility of the Federal Gov-
ernment on individual States. 
I know this. I dealt with it firsthand 
as a sheriff in Fort Bend County, 
Texas. I had to tell dozens of residents 
in my home county whose homes were 
burglarized by a ring of illegal aliens 
from Honduras and Colombia that 
many of the illegal aliens had been de-
ported multiple times. 
In January of 2020, in my office, I had 
to sit and tell a son whose mother was 
killed in a hit and run that the illegal 
alien that ran his mother over had 
been 
deported 
six—yes, 
six—times 
prior. That fellow right there. 
Madam Speaker, enough is enough. 
End this crisis. Put the American peo-
ple first and secure our southern bor-
der. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I am so 
grateful for those comments and for 
the gentleman’s expertise. This passion 
that you see, Madam Speaker, is de-
served. We are so concerned that the 
President doesn’t share it, and that is 
what you are hearing echoed over and 
over tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. TAYLOR), who 
represents the Third District. 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, as I 
walked through rows and rows of chil-
dren who had just made a long and dan-
gerous journey to Texas’ southern bor-
der sitting on cots in a crowded room 
three times the size of the room that 
we are in right now, it has never been 
more clear to me than right there that 
illegal immigration benefits no one. 
I have witnessed the heartbreaking 
conditions inside these emergency in-
take sites. In the words of one facility 
commander, the volunteers and staff 
that were working there tirelessly, 
they were operating under a crisis level 
of care. A crisis level of care. There is 
no doubt that we are facing a humani-
tarian crisis, a health crisis, and a na-
tional security crisis, all of great pro-
portions. 
We didn’t get here overnight. The 
Biden-Harris administration made a 
reckless decision, choosing to overturn 
policies 
implemented 
by 
President 
Trump. But those policies were work-
ing, and the Biden-Harris administra-
tion had no replacement policy, no 
strategy, no plan to replace it. 
During my visit to this facility in 
north Texas, I listened to the stories of 
cartels and coyotes advertising that 
they could get your children across the 
U.S. border on television. That is right. 
The cartels are advertising on tele-
vision that they can get children smug-
gled across our southern border. 
By stopping construction and the 
strategic importance of the border wall 
and rescinding the remain in Mexico 
policy, President Biden and Vice Presi-
dent Harris are sending a clear mes-
sage: If you come to the United States, 
we will let you in. 
Currently, as cartels are exploiting 
this 
administration’s 
irresponsible 
open border policies, the cartels are 
raking in roughly $14 million a day. 
That is right, you heard me correctly. 
$14 million a day going straight into 
the hands of criminals because of the 
reckless policy decisions of the Biden 
administration. 
If that statistic isn’t enough on its 
own, DHS is projecting 117,000 children 
without their parents will arrive at the 
border this year alone. That is a 45 per-
cent increase over the highest we have 
ever had. 
Madam Speaker, this is a crisis, and 
this administration and Democrats in

Congress need to call it just that and 
fix it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentleman for that perspective 
from Texas again. So we’ve got Texas 
and Arizona. Madam Speaker, we are 
going to move a little further west, all 
the way west to California. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARCIA), who represents the 
25th District there. 
Mr. GARCIA of California. I thank 
Mr. JOHNSON for hosting this very im-
portant Special Order hour. 
I rise today to share my concerns 
about our crisis at the southern border. 
As a first-generation American, I un-
derstand the opportunities that this 
Nation provides and why every human 
being on this planet should want to 
come to the United States. I am a prod-
uct of the American Dream, but I also 
value the law. I value law and order. 
The first step in fixing our broken 
immigration system must be securing 
our border. In March we saw over 
172,000 migrants attempt to illegally 
cross our border. That is a 71 percent 
increase in just one month. 
The Biden administration continues 
to fail to address this crisis. This is no 
doubt a product of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policy, but make no mistake, 
this is now our collective problem. It is 
affecting our local neighborhoods, it is 
affecting our governments, it is affect-
ing those who have come here legally, 
who are now being cut in front of by 
folks who are breaking the law to come 
here. 
Communities in border towns are 
stretched thin and running low on local 
resources as more migrants flood their 
communities. This isn’t just about the 
border. The crisis impacts all of us 
across America, including my district, 
the beautiful 25th District, where we 
see a rise in crime tied to illegal immi-
gration and human trafficking. This is 
being aggravated by the defund the po-
lice movement. 
The crisis at our border is about se-
curity. It is about safety, and it is 
about 
humanity. 
No 
human 
being 
should be experiencing in their entire 
lifetime what hundreds of thousands of 
humans are experiencing right now at 
our own southern border. 
Let me be clear. We can be a wel-
coming nation, but we can also be a na-
tion that abides by its own laws and 
enforces them simultaneously. We need 
to secure the border, provide the re-
sources to our Border Patrol agents, 
and stop incentivizing people to come 
here illegally. When we do those 
things, we can address the rest of our 
problems. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentleman for that compelling tes-
timony from a first-generation Amer-
ican. That is meaningful. We prize im-
migration, the legal kind. We believe 
in the rule of law, and that is what 
maintains order. 
I yield to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN), the youngest 
Member of Congress, but he is wise be-
yond his years. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, if 
Americans like what Democrats did for 
Baltimore, then they will love what 
Democrats will do for the planet. 
The Biden infrastructure bill and the 
stimulus bill before it shows that 
Democrats are more interested in 
transforming our Nation’s definitions 
of words than they are our physical in-
frastructure of roads and bridges. We 
need to cut government waste, not cre-
ate more. 
And now the left wants to drag the 
Green New Deal through America’s 
back door without any regard for the 
wishes of millions of Americans. Make 
no mistake, this infrastructure pro-
posal is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It is 
a Socialist wish list disguised as a 
roads and bridges initiative. 
This is exactly what Democrats have 
been doing since the day I was sworn 
in. They know that America is in des-
perate need of infrastructure reform, 
and they know that Republicans and 
Americans nationwide would vote for a 
commonsense infrastructure proposal, 
but have they proposed such an initia-
tive? Absolutely not. 
b 2015 
They will pretend that this legisla-
tion deals with infrastructure, and 
then they will stand on the steps of 
their multimillion-dollar mansions and 
decry any votes against their Trojan 
horse of a bill. 
Americans are fed up. Why aren’t we 
passing legislation that does what it 
claims to be doing? Why are my col-
leagues on the left so excited to pre-
tend critical race theory is the same as 
critically needed roads? 
Let’s dispense between this false 
equivalency. Let’s build bridges, not 
just the physical but actual bipartisan 
bridges here in Congress. Why aren’t 
we working together on the pitifully 
few issues that we still happen to agree 
on these days? 
I am wondering. My constituents are 
wondering. America is wondering. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. CAWTHORN for 
that perspective. 
Madam Speaker, I will move briskly 
because we have a lot of Members, as 
you can see, who are passionate about 
these issues and want to weigh in to-
night. 
I yield to the gentleman from the 
First District of the great State of Ala-
bama (Mr. CARL), who will take the po-
dium here. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my concern for the 
unprecedented crisis at our southern 
border because of the Biden adminis-
tration’s reckless open-border policy 
and failure to enforce our Nation’s im-
migration laws. 
We are seeing thousands of illegal 
immigrants crossing the border every 
single day, and there is no sign of let-
ting up. The President and the Vice 
President are nowhere to be found. 
That is not leadership. We need lead-
ership. We have a crisis at the border, 
and leadership, we are making a call 
for help, please. 
The Vice President was appointed as 
the border czar weeks ago and has yet 
to take a single trip to the southern 
border. That is unacceptable. 
We must have strong border protec-
tion for the health, safety, and security 
of American citizens. It is time for this 
administration and the far left to put 
America first by enforcing our immi-
gration laws and putting an end to this 
horrific crisis at our southern border. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Louisiana for yield-
ing and for holding this Special Order 
tonight. 
The American people are frightened 
by what they are seeing unfold at the 
southern border. That fear is real, and 
it is only amplified by an administra-
tion that has chosen to sit back and do 
absolutely nothing. 
For months, the Biden administra-
tion has struggled to decide what to 
call this situation, often scrambling to 
find the newest and less severe syn-
onym to the word ‘‘crisis.’’ The word 
‘‘crisis’’ suits this situation perfectly, 
but apparently, that word is too harsh, 
according to the White House. 
Pretty 
soon, 
this 
administration 
won’t have any words left to use, and 
they will accept the reality that they 
need to own up to the crisis they cre-
ated. 
Republicans are not interested in let-
ting complacency take hold while the 
country we love is left open and vulner-
able and changed forever. We will con-
tinue to call out this administration 
for its failures, and we will continue to 
fight to protect America and its citi-
zens. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina for her remarks, 
and we do call out the administration. 
That is what this Special Order is all 
about. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee’s 
Second 
District 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Vice Chairman JOHNSON
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the crisis at the 
southern border is a problem of the 
Biden administration’s own creation. 
As soon as they took office, the Biden 
administration slapped an ‘‘open for 
business’’ sign on our southern border. 
They scrapped commonsense immigra-
tion policies that were keeping our 
country secure. Now, our southern bor-
der is overwhelmed with immigrants 
who expect to enter the country with-
out proper vetting. 
Hiding among those massive crowds 
of people are drug smugglers, child 
traffickers, and terrorists who have no 
intention 
of 
positively 
impacting 
American communities. 
We need to know who is coming into 
our country and why, for the sake of 
national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2045 
April 21, 2021 
Ironically, even though Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS decried this prac-
tice, children are still being packed 
into overcrowded detention facilities 
and sleeping in cages. They were out-
raged about this back when they were 
campaigning for President, but now 
they are actually silent on the issue. 
We need to get back to the successful 
border security policies of the Trump 
administration, including construction 
of our border wall. I am an original co-
sponsor of the Finish the Wall Act, 
which would resume construction of 
the border wall and make it more dif-
ficult for folks, especially the bad ac-
tors, to cross the southern border ille-
gally. 
House Republicans are ready to se-
cure the border, and I am proud to join 
my colleagues on the floor this evening 
to call out the Biden administration’s 
ongoing inaction. If President Biden is 
not physically or mentally capable of 
addressing this problem, he should step 
down. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Tennessee for those bold words, and he 
is right. I think that expresses the sen-
timent of a lot of Americans. 
I yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ), who knows a lot about 
immigration as well as infrastructure 
because he is a former fire chief and 
mayor and now a Member of Congress. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, over 
the past several weeks, I have joined 
Leader MCCARTHY and House Homeland 
Security Committee Republicans on 
two separate trips to our southern bor-
der. What I saw on the ground is heart-
breaking: countless unaccompanied mi-
nors, often very young girls, left at the 
hands of international cartels, many of 
them violated; migrants packed into 
cramped processing facilities; and sei-
zures of illicit narcotics being traf-
ficked into the United States. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Biden-Harris 
White House has drastically shifted 
from 
the 
previous 
administration’s 
policies on immigration and border se-
curity through executive order. At no 
point during the crafting of these exec-
utive orders were congressional Repub-
licans consulted, nor have Republicans 
had a proper venue for input on plans 
from the White House. The result? Day 
by day, the crisis along our southern 
border is getting worse. 
It has been a month since President 
Biden 
named 
our 
Vice 
President, 
KAMALA HARRIS, as the border czar. 
What have we seen so far? Zero media 
appearances about the border, no press 
conferences, no trips to the border, 
radio silence for the Vice President. 
She said she is going to the Northern 
Triangle to meet with Guatemalans 
and Hondurans. She doesn’t need to. 
She can come to the southern border 
and talk directly to Guatemalans and 
Hondurans, and migrants from many 
other countries, while they are ille-
gally crossing the border. 
While she is at it, Vice President 
HARRIS should speak with Customs and 
Border Protection agents who are on 
the ground handling the situation in-
stead of Federal bureaucrats sitting in 
their offices in Washington. 
As an immigrant, I call on Vice 
President HARRIS to do her job and fix 
this crisis. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
speaking with such authority. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania’s Ninth Dis-
trict (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Louisiana, Vice Chair MIKE JOHNSON, 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we can all agree our 
Nation’s transportation and infrastruc-
ture system is in need of investment to 
improve our quality of life and eco-
nomic competitiveness. Very unfortu-
nately, the Biden administration has 
thus far chosen a go-it-alone approach 
in solving this problem with a $2.3 tril-
lion proposal, whereby less than 8 per-
cent would go toward improving our 
Nation’s roads, bridges, highways, air-
ports, ports, and waterways, tradi-
tional infrastructure. 
The rest is filled with provisions that 
have nothing to do with traditional 
T&I as we all know it, including $173 
billion for electric cars and car elec-
trical ports for powering; $400 billion to 
expand Medicaid programs, which is 
not infrastructure; and hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars to implement provi-
sions of the Green New Deal. 
As a means to pay for it, the Biden 
administration and Democratic leader-
ship plan to raise taxes by over $2 tril-
lion. At a time when our economy is in 
recovery, and we are supposed to be on 
the side of American manufacturing 
and repatriating jobs, bringing these 
companies back to America, the idea of 
significant tax increases is another up-
side-down policy and will certainly not 
attract business but only export them. 
Additionally, our infrastructure plan 
needs to be supplemented by private 
capital investment. That is where ac-
countability comes from. That is why I 
plan to introduce the Infrastructure 
Bank for America Act, which would 
add to existing government funding 
with private investment, increasing ac-
cess to capital for worthy infrastruc-
ture projects that deliver on R&I and 
deliver value to the American people at 
a fraction of the cost to the taxpayer. 
Contrary to the Biden infrastructure 
plan, IBA investments would not be re-
stricted and would help finance surface 
transportation projects, grid security, 
broadband, and revitalization of cities 
and towns across America and my dis-
trict. 
Thus far, the Biden administration 
has failed to reach across the aisle in a 
meaningful way to accomplish any-
thing. We should unite to fix our roads, 
bridges, highways, airports, and other 
gateways to growth and innovation, 
not exploit this opportunity and pass a 
$2 trillion liberal wish list that will 
raise taxes, impose Green New Deal 
mandates, and add trillions to our na-
tional debt. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
mentioning just one of the many Re-
publican ideas we have. And as he said, 
we are not there at the table. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee’s Sixth District 
(Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention to a critical 
need for infrastructure for all of Amer-
ica, and especially in my home State of 
Tennessee. 
I believe it is past time that we build 
new transportation systems and refur-
bish structures to accommodate our 
modern economy and our growing 
workforce. I am a strong proponent of 
fixing our crumbling roads and bridges 
and expanding access to broadband 
internet in unserved areas. 
In Tennessee, over half a million 
residents only have access to one inter-
net service provider, and 274,000 Ten-
nesseans still have no access at their 
place of residence. These are real infra-
structure 
projects 
that 
desperately 
need our attention. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
most recent multitrillion-dollar give-
away has little to do with actual infra-
structure, with only 6 percent of this 
bill going to projects that fund roads, 
bridges, or highways. 
Even if we use the most expanded 
definition 
of 
infrastructure, 
which 
might include upgrading wastewater 
and drinking water systems, expanding 
high-speed broadband internet service 
to 100 percent of the Nation, modern-
izing the electric grid, and improving 
infrastructure 
resilience, 
infrastruc-
ture in this plan is only 24 percent of 
its total cost. 
President Biden is attempting to re-
define infrastructure to include all of 
the Democratic Party’s pet projects 
and extreme priorities. In this case, it 
means enacting Green New Deal-style 
programs and implementing job-killing 
tax hikes on Americans and their busi-
nesses. 
Since this proposal has little to do 
with infrastructure and grossly inflates 
the number of jobs it would actually 
create, we should call this proposal 
what it really is, a con job. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it is a con job, indeed. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Louisiana has 32 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan’s 
First 
District 
(Mr. 
BERGMAN), who is the highest ranked 
military officer ever elected to the 
United States Congress and also my 
dear friend and classmate. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative 
JOHNSON
for 
yielding. It is an honor to be here on 
the floor with him tonight. 
Our country recognizes leadership at 
all levels, regardless of party ideology,

H2046 
April 21, 2021 
and I see here on the floor real leader-
ship, committed leadership. 
I rise today to express deep concern 
for the state of our Nation’s southern 
border. Words matter, and it is time we 
start calling this situation what it 
really is: a crisis. In simple words, it is 
what it is. Don’t try to paint it in 
many different ways. 
President Biden has invited this cri-
sis through his words and in his execu-
tive actions, including terminating 
construction of the wall on our south-
ern border. 
We need real leadership now. Now is 
not the time to be hiding. We need the 
leaders to step out and step up. It is 
time to put up and put out the political 
gamesmanship, put that all behind us 
and take a serious look at what is hap-
pening on the southern border. When I 
say a serious look, I mean that lit-
erally. 
Vice President HARRIS, let alone 
President Biden, has yet to visit the 
border since being charged with ad-
dressing the crisis there. The United 
States is and must always remain a 
free and welcoming Nation. 
We are all immigrants. We are immi-
grants by generations who came here 
for one of two reasons, for an oppor-
tunity or fleeing persecution. That 
hasn’t changed. 
b 2030 
We are also, and by all standards 
measured, a Nation of law and order, 
and our laws must be followed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Congress to 
take up critical legislation, such as 
Representative ANDY BIGGS’ Stopping 
Border Surges Act and Representative 
JEFF DUNCAN’s H.R. 88, Build up Illegal 
Line Defenses with Assets Lawfully 
Lifted Act of 2021. These bills will 
begin to address the root cause of our 
immigration issues. 
In addition, the bureaucracies here in 
D.C. can play a positive role, such as 
Department of Labor and DHS. They 
can help. Because when you look at 
those who seek to come here legally 
and work as guest workers, we can 
bring good people from around the 
world here through the H2B and H2A 
programs. They do not seek permanent 
status; they come here to work, and 
they go home. The bureaucracies can 
get involved to help good, legal immi-
gration occur after you separate out 
the guest worker programs. 
Madam Speaker, we can secure our 
border, protect those wishing to come 
here legally, and crack down on those 
who wish to do us harm—and I mean, 
crack down on those who wish to do us 
harm. It is time this body gets to work 
to address this critical issue imme-
diately. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the general. I appre-
ciate that so much. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BAIRD), 
Fourth 
District, 
another 
American 
hero, another hero of mine, a gen-
tleman who sacrificially served his 
country and deserves to speak here to-
night and has great insight for us. 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Louisiana for yield-
ing. I appreciate the opportunity to be 
here. 
Madam Speaker, this evening I really 
rise to voice my concerns over the 
President’s $2 trillion infrastructure 
plan. 
One concern is the steep price tag, 
but a bigger concern is what the ad-
ministration is trying to classify as in-
frastructure. 
These 
attempts 
from 
some on the other side of the aisle to 
classify their partisan priorities as in-
frastructure, is inexcusable and it is ir-
responsible. 
The President is asking American 
taxpayers to fork over $2 trillion. If the 
President is asking Americans to make 
a substantial investment, it is Con-
gress’ responsibility to ensure that 
these tax dollars are spent wisely. 
Unfortunately, the President’s pro-
posed bill doesn’t do this. How can it be 
infrastructure legislation when less 
than 6 percent goes to roads and 
bridges and less than 5 percent goes to 
broadband infrastructure? 
There is a true need for infrastruc-
ture. For instance, in my district, our 
rural communities need help getting 
their last mile of broadband. This pan-
demic has proven that high speed 
broadband must be addressed. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can re-
move the partisan approach to this bill 
and solve the real infrastructure chal-
lenges of our country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is so sad 
that broadband needs are not being 
met because politics are in the way. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today with se-
rious reservations about the proposed 
infrastructure policies coming before 
this body. 
Every Member in Congress represents 
a district with infrastructure needs. 
Urban or rural, conservative or liberal, 
we all represent communities that 
have 
dire 
infrastructure 
needs 
we 
should be addressing. 
That is why President Biden’s recent 
discussion about infrastructure, along 
with his comments about wanting to 
establish a bipartisan legislative effort 
were encouraging. 
Unfortunately, none of this would 
come to fruition. We didn’t see a bipar-
tisan push. We didn’t see significant 
input taken from Members and Sen-
ators on our side of the aisle. We didn’t 
see a willingness to want to work to-
gether. 
The $2.2 trillion plan wasn’t released 
after significant back-and-forth discus-
sions. No, it was released after develop-
ment by the White House and then 
pushed out in a media blitz. 
As anticipated, the package was a 
partisan exercise. Just 5 percent goes 
to repairing roads and bridges. As the 
core definition of infrastructure, there 
is very little attention shown. Only 1 
percent goes to airports. Other coun-
tries around the world continue to 
build state-of-the-art airports, as air-
ports here in the United States strug-
gle to keep up with demand. Ports and 
inland waterways, an issue important 
to me as the representative of two 
major seaports, is even more astound-
ing. Just one percent of this bill goes 
to ports and inland waterways. Ridicu-
lous. 
Now is the time for real infrastruc-
ture investments, but this isn’t the 
plan Americans need. 
I urge my colleagues to start from 
scratch and focus on the real issue 
here: 
Our 
Nation’s 
infrastructure 
needs. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman so 
much for that. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to go 
back across the country again to the 
great State of California’s Eighth Dis-
trict. I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
infrastructure is a bipartisan issue. We 
all agree that one of the primary func-
tions of government is to provide for 
the people collectively what they are 
unable to individually provide for 
themselves. I am talking about things 
like highways and roads and dams and 
harbors and airports. Things that rep-
resent long-term investments in the fu-
ture of our country. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
infrastructure 
package we are currently considering 
only devotes 12 percent of the over $2 
trillion of spending to infrastructure 
projects like those. 
To give you some egregious exam-
ples, the proposed infrastructure pack-
age devotes substantially more money 
to subsidizing the purchase of electric 
vehicles than it does to building the 
roads and the highways that those ve-
hicles would drive on. 
The proposed infrastructure package 
devotes over ten times as much money 
to expansion of Medicaid than it does 
to the construction of water infrastruc-
ture, of dams and of airports put to-
gether. 
It is not to say that these other 
projects are without merit, but the 
problem is that almost every dollar of 
this spending contributes to our na-
tional debt. That means that we need 
to consider only the projects that rep-
resent a true, long-term investment in 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
pare this package down to the projects 
that accomplish exactly that. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
that California perspective. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON), the Republican leader of the 
House Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2047 
April 21, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss the Democrat’s infrastructure bill. 
We have seen a lot in the news over 
the last few weeks about President 
Biden’s 
not-so-much 
infrastructure 
plan. There is so much unrelated pork 
in this bill that even Washington re-
porters are hesitant to call it an infra-
structure plan. 
When we think of the word ‘‘infra-
structure,’’ we think roads, bridges, 
highways. We can expand further and 
think of ports, waterways, and air-
ports. Democrats so-called infrastruc-
ture plan is not really about infra-
structure—6 percent is allocated to 
roads, bridges, and highways, and a 
mere 2 percent for airways, waterways, 
and ports. Together, we are just barely 
getting to 8 percent of the $2.3 trillion 
plan to focus on infrastructure. 
But what is the rest focused on? Well, 
it is a wish list of Progressive policies 
and it is an excuse for Democrats to 
give $600 billion—over half a trillion 
dollars—to the Green New Deal. 
While I believe there is an oppor-
tunity for bipartisanship—a successful 
infrastructure bill must be bipartisan— 
the majority must be willing to make 
reasonable concessions to address our 
reasonable concerns. If we do this 
right, it should look like a bill that we 
wrote together. 
This bill has the chance to fix our in-
frastructure, provide jobs, and jump- 
start our economy following COVID–19, 
but it will only succeed if Democrats 
choose to include Republicans and 
bring us to the table. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That 
went so well, I think we will stay in 
the State of Pennsylvania, going to the 
12th District. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, improving Amer-
ica’s infrastructure should be bipar-
tisan. Revitalizing our Nation’s roads 
and bridges, delivering broadband to 
rural America, and working together 
to build a more connected society are 
all things we can and should strive to 
accomplish. 
The Biden administration’s so-called 
infrastructure plan is not infrastruc-
ture, and it is definitely not bipartisan. 
Less than 2 months removed from the 
last 
multi-trillion-dollar 
bill, 
the 
American people are about to be sad-
dled with another massive tax-and- 
spend package—this time with a price 
tag of $2.3 trillion and a bag of empty 
promises. 
With only a fraction of the $2.3 tril-
lion going toward things like roads, 
bridges, waterways, dams, airports, and 
broadband, the majority of the plan is 
instead filled with non-infrastructure 
items. 
Case in point: Joe Biden spends 74 
percent more of your money on sub-
sidies for electric vehicles than it allo-
cates for rural broadband. It is ironic 
that Washington Democrats talk about 
improving infrastructure while simul-
taneously working to dismantle and 
eliminate American energy jobs. Make 
no mistake, it takes American energy 
to build American infrastructure. 
While Washington Democrats talk 
about improvements to American in-
frastructure, they fail to recognize 
that Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan is not the 
answer. Instead, we must embrace 
America’s domestic energy industry, 
which has made greater strides in in-
vesting in our Nation’s infrastructure 
than Joe Biden’s wasteful spending 
plans ever could. 
If Joe Biden truly believes this is an 
infrastructure package, it is evidence 
that he has been in Washington, D.C., 
for far too long. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. And 
he has indeed been in Washington too 
long. 
Madam Speaker, there is a common 
denominator tonight. The crisis at the 
border and the problems with the infra-
structure package were both entirely 
created by the Biden administration. 
They were both thus completely 
avoidable, completely predictable, and 
they have done and are doing an ex-
traordinary disservice and real damage 
to the American people. 
We ask, again, of all of our Democrat 
colleagues and President Biden and his 
administration, please, please, for the 
sake of our country, put the partisan-
ship aside. Let’s govern with common 
sense, let’s fix these problems before 
they become so great that we are un-
able to do so. 
Madam Speaker, we end the Special 
Order, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
UNEMPLOYMENT BY EDUCATION 
LEVEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
this is going to be one of those eve-
nings where you have a lot of things to 
share, but they are actually really 
about two subjects. And I am going to 
ask us to try to think about things a 
little bit differently. And as is my bad 
habit, I brought a number of charts to 
just try to get our heads around it. 
Some of what I am going to share to-
night—I am going to try to dial back 
the sarcasm, but we have got to get our 
heads around facts and reality. 
One of the first things I want to go 
through is what we did employment- 
wise, who got hurt during this last 
year. 
Our brothers and sisters who have 
sort of less-than-a-high-school edu-
cation, if you see this green chart right 
there, this is sort of talking about the 
unemployment levels for those who are 
lower on education. 
You have got to understand, this last 
year was absolutely crushing to our 
brothers and sisters who really either 
didn’t graduate high school or barely 
graduated high school. Their value 
that they sell is their labor. And the 
numbers are still just really, really 
high. Look at the disproportion be-
tween those of us who have bachelor’s 
degrees or graduate degrees. We had a 
blip, but not much of one. 
Individuals here who didn’t graduate 
high school, they are getting their 
heads kicked in, and they still are. So 
we are going to talk about some of the 
policy going around us. 
b 2045 
And the next part is, it is beyond just 
unemployment. For those of us in the 
Joint Economic Committee, those on 
Ways and Means, those who actually 
pay attention to the numbers, the U–6, 
and all these things put out by the 
Labor Department, the real number we 
need to pay attention to is actually 
something called labor force participa-
tion. 
What does it mean when someone is 
not in the labor force with their skill 
sets, age? 
Their 
attachment 
to 
work 
gets 
broader and more difficult to reattach. 
Their ability to climb to a supervisor 
or watch their pay go up gets really 
damaged. 
And on this one, do you see this line 
down here? 
We are, right now, seeing some labor 
force participation by education levels. 
For those who didn’t finish high 
school, half of them aren’t in the labor 
force. 
Do you understand what is going on 
right now with what we would tradi-
tionally refer to as the working poor, 
except they are not working? 
Now, part of this is because of the ab-
surd policies we have engaged in. What 
happens when you make public policy 
by your heart, by feelings, instead of 
math, instead of facts, instead of ac-
tual compassion that understands what 
makes someone’s life better? 
We just financed keeping people out 
of the labor force. 
Do you understand? Do we under-
stand? Do we understand? As a body, do 
we understand what we just did to the 
future earning powers of those individ-
uals that we incentivized not to be in 
the labor force? 
And we are already seeing it. 
Was the goal here to make these indi-
viduals permanently poor? 
Because that is what we are accom-
plishing right now. 
So, obviously, because the rhetoric 
around here, particularly from the left, 
is that they care about the working 
poor, we would be seeing public policy 
that actually takes care and helps the 
working poor, makes the value of their 
labor more valuable. 
What is the single number one thing 
that crushes the labor value of the 
working poor? 
It turns out—and we were a little 
surprised, but we did a bunch of re-
search—it is when you have an open

border policy, because, all of a sudden, 
you have those who actually—their 
value economically is selling their 
labor. 
You now have decided you are going 
to make them compete with those com-
ing across the border. And, on occa-
sion, we will be here on the floor and 
we will hear arguments about compas-
sion for individuals from around the 
world who have presented themselves 
at our border in Arizona. And I just 
desperately wonder, Where the hell is 
the compassion for the working poor in 
our own country? 
Here is the math. I mean, you know, 
the peak pandemic unemployment rate 
was well over 20 percent for those who 
didn’t finish high school, for those who 
basically—their 
economic 
value 
is 
their labor. But it is worse than that. 
When you have an open border policy, 
you have basically crushed their wages. 
Their future wages go negative. 
You know, I know we all just heard 
an hour of border policy and those 
things. Maybe I see too much of the 
world through sort of an economic 
lens, but I think that is also a fairer 
lens. It is not meant to be brutality 
right or left. It is a love and compas-
sion for those in our society who were 
being left behind for so long. We are 
crushing them again. 
I mean, the best math we have come 
up with is if you didn’t finish high 
school and you have a society that has 
moved to open borders, which function-
ally is the math you have added hun-
dreds of thousands of new moderate- to 
low-skill workers. 
What is the value of the skills or lack 
of skills of a population who are al-
ready with you? 
On the chart, it goes down well over 
6 percent. They are going to be paid 
less. We have just created more pov-
erty not by those who have presented 
themselves at the border, but to our 
domestic population here. 
This is a type of economic cruelty. I 
mean, it may be a little rhetorically 
flamboyant, but it is a type of eco-
nomic cruelty on the very population 
that so many of us here talk about we 
care, talk about we want to help. And 
what is going on right now to the 
working poor with the policy, particu-
larly being promulgated by the left, is 
crushing. And this is just the open bor-
der side. 
Do we understand that what we have 
also done economically? 
Say I came to you tomorrow and 
said, Hey, here is what we are going to 
do. We are going to pump stunning 
amounts of money into the economy, 
and we are going to look the other way 
when we start to see inflation on com-
modity prices, on food prices, and on a 
lot of the basics. A lot of our constitu-
ents are going to shrug, and say, Okay, 
a little bit of inflation, fine. 
Has anyone also talked about what 
inflation does to the working poor? 
The fact of the matter is, when you 
start to look at the actual data—if you 
are in the top 10 percent of income, a 
little bit of inflation actually makes 
you wealthier because you own real es-
tate, you own assets. They become 
more valuable. But if you are an indi-
vidual where a substantial portion of 
your income just goes to pay your food 
bill—what we have engaged in in eco-
nomic policy this last year is substan-
tially malpractice. We are making 
their lives miserable. And the solution 
from the left is, well, we will just sub-
sidize them more. 
So let’s talk about that. Do we un-
derstand what you have just done? 
If I incentivize you by—we are going 
to send you a check, and then we are 
going to give you an additional month-
ly check, an enhanced unemployment 
benefit, and we will give you maybe 
some more money for this and that. 
None of those things incentivize you, 
saying, we know you need help, we are 
going to help you get reattached to 
work so you can gain skills, so you can 
move up in the organization, so your 
wages can go up so there is actually 
productivity in the society, so you are 
actually paying taxes into what is your 
Social Security and Medicare account, 
so you have, what is it, your 60 quar-
ters, all of those things that are so im-
portant to raising the poor out of pov-
erty. 
Instead, we have done just the oppo-
site. We have financially incentivized 
millions of Americans not to be part of 
the labor pool. We have incentivized 
millions of Americans for a year to not 
gain the skill sets, the labor attach-
ment. 
There are some of our economists we 
are talking to that say we are going to 
spend decades paying for this. And it is 
right in front of us. We all knew what 
we were doing. It was just easy, be-
cause creating policy says, hey, we are 
going to give you this to help you work 
through the devastation of this last 
year, but here is the incentive to get 
back in the labor pool and the market. 
So when we actually have our small 
employers complain to us that they 
can’t hire anyone, yet at the same 
time—we go back to my previous slide 
about labor participation. We have mil-
lions and millions and millions of 
Americans who aren’t working. Unem-
ployment has been going down. It is be-
cause these folks have dropped out. 
They are not counted as unemployed. 
We will pay a devastating societal 
price for doing this to so many people. 
And why is this so important and 
why is it such a contrast to where we 
were in 2018, 2019, and the first quarter 
of 2020? 
Do you understand what a miracle we 
were living for a couple of years there? 
The fact of the matter is, if you look 
at income and equality, which used to 
be the harbinger of society fairness 
after tax reform, as to the regulatory 
reform, after making labor valuable for 
our working poor, they got dramati-
cally less poor, and we have lost that. 
In this last year, we have basically 
wiped out one of the steepest curves of 
progress in economic history of the 
United States. You take a look at this 
chart and you start to think about the 
wage gains that Hispanics, African 
Americans, Asians were having. Their 
wage gains were going up much faster 
than Anglos. 
This is what we all claim we desire. 
This makes a much fairer, more egali-
tarian society. We made the value of 
our 
brothers’ 
and 
sisters’ 
talents, 
skills, labor, much more valuable. And 
then now we have adopted policies that 
crush them. We have done everything 
half-ass backwards. 
And you start to take a look at what 
happened after tax reform, regulatory 
reform, and many of the things we did 
before. It really was just stunning. One 
of the most interesting numbers was 
the value of female participation in the 
economy. Remember, before the pan-
demic, we actually had more females 
working than males. They had a dra-
matically faster wage gain. We had one 
of the year’s—actually, I think if I do 
2018, 2019, African-American females 
had double-digit wage gains, finally. 
The rhetoric in this place for dec-
ades: We need to think and care about 
the working poor. 
Suddenly, economic policy did some-
thing for the working poor. It just hap-
pened to be making tax policy and reg-
ulatory policy that invested in plants 
and equipment and technology that 
made those businesses more produc-
tive. Meaning—because you all remem-
ber your elementary economics class. 
What are the two common factors 
that change your wages? 
Inflation. Okay. That doesn’t get you 
anywhere. Your wages go up just to 
catch up with buying the same thing 
with more dollars. 
Productivity. Wages go up with pro-
ductivity. This was a productivity 
curve because of what was done in tax 
reform. And it was the beneficiaries— 
they weren’t rich people. They were 
poor people, except it is heresy to tell 
the truth with the math around here. 
So what breaks my heart is we have 
come so far and we have lost it. We 
keep adopting policies, whether it is 
what is going on at the border, what we 
have done to subsidize people not to 
join the labor pool, what we have done 
to promote inflation. All these are 
things that will crush the working 
poor. 
Once again, if you take a look at just 
the employment groups of the popu-
lation that had just amazing growth, 
Hispanic 
women, 
African-American 
women and men, White men, down 
here, White women. It was all the 
groups that my brothers and sisters on 
the left claim they care about. In 2018, 
2019, these numbers are miraculous. 
They aren’t little fractions. These are 
big deals. 
So why would this body on one hand 
be rhetorically—that this is the popu-
lations they care about, and then turn 
around and knife them with economic 
policy that will make the working poor 
poorer. 
Is it they don’t know better? Is it 
they are just leading with their hearts

and their feeling instead of some calcu-
lator math? 
I do this because there is a path. We 
can be compassionate, but we need to 
understand what makes poor people 
less poor. What actually drives income 
and equality. It is not trying to make 
rich people less rich. The idea is to 
make the multitudes of poor people 
less poor. 
And I can give you sort of a disrup-
tive thought. In Ways and Means, we 
have had hearings and discussions of 
the healthcare outcome differential by 
populations from COVID. It is abso-
lutely real. If you are a Native Amer-
ican, which I represent a couple of 
Tribal communities that are good 
friends; if you happen to be an urban 
minority, you have had much worse 
healthcare outcomes. 
But if you want to be honest about 
what you are seeing, is that racist? 
Well, the data says no. What it says 
is there were precursors in those com-
munities of health presentations that 
were much worse. So if you take a look 
at the charts—and we are working on 
this chart now—the early numbers are 
fascinating. 
Take a look at an urban minority 
population, my diabetes, my hyper-
tension, the still use of tobacco prod-
ucts, and you line that up with the bad 
outcomes from COVID, they almost 
line up exactly. 
b 2100 
Madam Speaker, if you give a damn 
about poor people, minority popu-
lations—and my Native Americans who 
are suffering in remarkable numbers 
from diabetes, which actually turns 
out to be the key precursor for why 
they have had such horrible outcomes 
during COVID—then it is time to step 
up and say that we can basically do the 
typical vision of the left which will put 
in some more health clinics, because 
we are going to try to make your mis-
ery more tolerable, or we can do a dis-
ruption and end the misery. 
It is time for something like an Oper-
ation Warp Speed for diabetes. Instead 
of patching over the misery, let’s find a 
way to cure it. I understand type 1 
autoimmune, type 2 lifestyle, these are 
complicated and difficult. But if I came 
to you a couple years ago and said, 
mRNA vaccines, we are going to do it 
in just several months, you would have 
thought I was out of my mind, Madam 
Speaker. You see the discussions now 
that we just leaped 10 years in tech-
nology of using the mRNA. We are 
functioning, it is a software problem 
now. 
The ability to cure virus infections, a 
number of cancers, and a number of 
other diseases is now a software prob-
lem. We are on the edge of miracles. 
Is this going to be the continued pol-
icy of, well, we are going to just patch 
over people’s miseries, or are we going 
to cure them? 
There are some brilliant examples in 
just the last couple years. 
Do you remember hepatitis C, the 
projections it was going to cost for the 
coming liver transplants and the num-
ber of people who had served in the 
military who were going to be dying 
miserable deaths waiting for that liver 
transplant? 
Then what did we do? 
We came up with a cure. The cure 
was really expensive at first—dramati-
cally less expensive than a liver trans-
plant—and now with competition and 
technology we have crashed the price. 
We have a cure for hemophilia. 
Madam Speaker, you saw that with 
the mRNA technology, we may be on 
the cusp finally for a vaccine for HIV. 
As a body and as Members, we talk 
about how much we love and care 
about the minority populations we rep-
resent, and then we are not willing to 
think disruptively on what ends the 
misery. We seem to have our heads 
stuck somewhere decades ago that we 
are just going to make the misery 
more tolerable. My passion is let’s 
make it go away. 
Madam Speaker, if you really care 
about healthcare differentials between 
ethnic populations, understand what 
caused it—we have that data—and go 
at it. Let’s cure it. 
It turns out over the next 30 years— 
the best number I have come up with 
for the next 30 years of Medicare— 
Medicare will be the primary driver of 
U.S. debt. Ten years from now, we are 
at $42 trillion of debt and the curve 
steepens. It is demographics. It is just 
baby boomers are getting older, and we 
are going to consume a lot of re-
sources. But it turns out 30 percent of 
that healthcare spending in Medicare, 
it actually turns out that over 30 per-
cent is diabetes. 
If compassion and love for our broth-
ers and sisters in curing something like 
diabetes isn’t what drives you, Madam 
Speaker, how about just the debt? 
The single biggest impact we can 
have on the debt, it turns out, would be 
a cure for diabetes. 
So if you are a fiscal hawk, Madam 
Speaker, go at it. If you claim to be 
compassionate, go at it. If you want to 
keep people just having a nicer way to 
suffer, then leave the types of policies 
we are doing right now where we are 
going to do a patchwork quilt of a cou-
ple more healthcare centers. 
So, Madam Speaker, I am incredibly 
distressed that the Democrat policies 
adopted so far this year, when you lay 
them out—when our brothers and sis-
ters who are on the sidelines, because 
they have been able to financially 
live—survive, if that is what you want 
to call it, and they are out of the work-
force, what is their economic skill set 
a year from now when the rug is pulled 
out from underneath them when we go 
back to something semi more normal? 
What violence have we done to their 
futures? 
I hope someone out there is listening 
and thinking about this. 
One of the other things I want to 
walk through is: my understanding is, 
over the next couple weeks we will talk 
infrastructure, we will talk the envi-
ronment, we will talk global warming, 
and we will talk greenhouse gasses. 
Can I beg of some of the folks around 
here to actually read? 
The amount of folklore that is 
spewed at these microphones is just in-
tensely frustrating. 
Madam Speaker, can I give you a 
simple, simple example? 
I have used this one before, but it is 
sort of the hallmark of the thought ex-
periment. 
Madam Speaker, if I came to you to-
morrow and asked you: Do you care 
about plastic in the oceans? 
Yes. 
Should we get rid of plastic straws in 
Washington, D.C., in your community? 
Of course. 
How many plastic straws are in the 
ocean from North America? 
None. 
We do an amazingly good job in our 
waste management, so why is there so 
much plastic floating in the ocean? 
It doesn’t come from the U.S. straws. 
There are 10 rivers in the world. Nine 
of them are in Asia and two are in Afri-
ca that account for 90 percent of the 
plastic in the oceans. 
Getting rid of your plastic straws is 
called virtue signaling. Hey, look at 
me, I care. Except that caring doesn’t 
do anything. It may make you feel bet-
ter, it may give you a selfie you can 
put up on your social media, but it 
didn’t do anything. 
Madam Speaker, if you actually 
cared about plastic in the ocean—and 
we have dozens of variations of this 
type of thing where we have folklore 
around the environment. 
We need to start doing the math. Go 
to the 10 rivers—eight in Asia and two 
in Africa—and finance the collection of 
the plastic. Create the recycling. Yes, 
it is a type of foreign aid. Yes, it is the 
adoption of technology. But if you 
want to deal with 90 percent of the 
plastic in the ocean, then go to where 
the plastic in the ocean is coming 
from, and it is not straws in your com-
munity. That is theater. This place re-
wards theater. We get campaign con-
tributions from theater. We get behind 
these microphones so we can do the-
ater. 
If you actually give a darn, Madam 
Speaker, then do something where the 
math actually says it has an actual im-
pact. 
One of the other proofs—and oddly 
enough, we relate this to tax policy. 
One of the really neat things that has 
been happening the last several years— 
and this goes back to the Obama ad-
ministration and the last administra-
tion—do you see this line here, Madam 
Speaker? 
That is GDP growth. This curve com-
ing down, particularly after tax reform 
where the curve dramatically steep-
ens—we are still working on our 2019 
numbers, we believe it steepens even 
more—this is greenhouse gases going 
into the environment. 
Do you notice something, Madam 
Speaker?

H2050 
April 21, 2021 
We were growing as a society and 
economy, yet environmental pollutants 
were crashing. We believe some of this 
inflection had to do with tax reform, 
the expensing portion where a company 
can say, I get to deduct 100 percent of 
the new, cleaner, better, faster, cheap-
er and more environmentally sensitive 
equipment, and we saw massive capital 
expenditures where productivity went 
up and greenhouse gases came down. 
It is a demonstration that if you get 
the regulatory and the tax policy right, 
you can have economic growth. People 
can 
have 
those 
opportunities. 
It 
doesn’t have to be a Malthusian world 
where you crush people. 
Some of this is new. If I came to you 
right now and said, hey, here is a ton of 
carbon, here is a ton of methane, the 
math is changed. So that is why a lot 
of the environmental calculations have 
changed the last couple years. 
My best guess is, from the latest 
things I am reading, methane has 
about a 9–1 ratio as a greenhouse ef-
fect. But also its half-life has been cut 
back dramatically in some of the for-
mulas. If you wanted to have a remark-
able impact on greenhouse gases, then 
stop the flaring and design a way to go 
collect the methane where we are pro-
ducing natural gas. 
It turns out we now have the tech-
nology where you pull up a truck, it 
super chills, compresses it, takes it 
away, and it is useable fuel; and it has 
a remarkable calculus. 
We actually did a thought experi-
ment—actually, it was more of a math 
experiment. I was blessed to have a 
Ph.D. of nuclear physics on staff, so his 
math was just remarkably good. 
We did a thought experiment. If I 
could run a major pipeline through 
west Texas capturing methane, did you 
know you basically come within a frac-
tion of hitting the Paris accords, 
Madam Speaker? 
When I proposed that to a number of 
my Democrat colleagues who are my 
friends, they said, DAVID, I love the 
math. This is exciting. But you have to 
understand, I can’t support a pipeline, 
because pipelines are heresy on our 
side. 
b 2110 
I said, if we would basically find the 
tax regulatory policy to make a pipe-
line work like this that collects meth-
ane where you compress it and make it 
a usable fuel, it turns out you could get 
all the way to the Paris accord by a 
single major project. 
Yes, DAVID, but you don’t under-
stand. It is actually not about hitting 
the numbers. It is about surviving po-
litically. 
I am going to beg of us to start using 
actual math and science instead of 
worrying about our next campaign con-
tribution or our feelings. 
The last one on this tirade—and when 
we come back, we have a stack of 
these. There is a revolutionary tech-
nology that is happening at this mo-
ment. Remember that curve we showed 
where 
we 
were 
having 
economic 
growth, GDP growth, yet greenhouse 
gases, particularly carbon, were going 
down for the United States? We can 
make that curve dramatically steeper. 
This is a facility that is about to be 
built by Occidental Petroleum in west 
Texas. There has also been a remark-
able improvement in the technology. 
MIT, about a year ago, had a major 
breakthrough and almost doubled the 
capacity of taking ambient air and 
pulling carbon right out of it. It is al-
most carbon mining out of the air. 
This is a really big facility about to 
go in. They are going to take the car-
bon and shove it back into the ground. 
It is a negative calculator. We should 
be finding joy as conservatives and lib-
erals that technology has brought us 
these types of opportunities. 
If we get the regulatory, if we get the 
Tax Code, and we update our thinking 
to this century, we can stop arguing 
about greenhouse gases and how much 
of the economy and how many people 
you want to unemploy or, you know, 
green jobs don’t pay as much, and say: 
Let’s just have the disruption in the 
economy like we always do. Let’s pro-
mote the things that make our world 
cleaner, healthier, more prosperous. 
Then, if we do things like this, maybe 
we end the economic violence on the 
working poor. 
Maybe this could be a really amazing 
decade instead of what I see going on 
right now, where we are pandering to 
functional extremists in so many of the 
environmental and other types of com-
munities. They may be passionate, but 
their math is really, really bad. 
Madam Speaker, I think I have had 
far too much caffeine today. I yield 
back the balance of my time.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS 
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR 
FY 2021 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, April 21, 2021. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2021. This status report is current 
through April 2, 2021. The term ‘‘current 
level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and 
revenues estimated for each fiscal year based 
on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s 
signature. 
Table 1 compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on February 25, 2021 for 
fiscal year 2021 and for the 10-year period of 
fiscal years 2021 through 2030. These com-
parisons are needed to implement section 
311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974, which establishes a rule enforceable 
with a point of order against measures that 
would breach the budget resolution’s aggre-
gate levels. The table does not show budget 
authority and outlays for years after fiscal 
year 2021 because appropriations for those 
years have not yet been completed. 
Table 2 compares the current status of ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2021 with the lim-
its filed in the Congressional Record on Feb-
ruary 25 for fiscal year 2021 for the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. The comparison is 
needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974, which pro-
hibits the consideration of measures that 
would breach the section 302(a) allocation of 
new budget authority. 
Table 3 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on February 25 for fiscal year 
2021, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 
2021 through 2030. These comparisons are 
needed to enforce the point of order under 
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974. It is also needed to implement 
section 311(c), which provides an exception 
for committees that comply with their allo-
cations from the point of order under section 
311(a). 
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2021 ap-
propriations bills. This table is needed to en-
force a rule against appropriations bills con-
taining advance appropriations that: (i) are 
not identified in the statement of the Chair-
man published in the Congressional Record 
on May 1, 2020 or (ii) would cause the aggre-
gate amount of such appropriations to ex-
ceed the level specified in section 203 of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, as continued 
in effect by the Concurrent Resolution on 
the Budget for Fiscal Year 2021. 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of 
legislation enacted after the adoption of the 
budget resolution against the budget resolu-
tion aggregate in force. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $474 million in budget authority and $733 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on February 25, 2021, by the Chair of the House Com-
mittee on the Budget pursuant to the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2021 (S. Con. Res. 5), do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level re-
port do not include those items.

The Speaker announced her signa-
ture to an enrolled bill of the Senate of 
the following title: 
S. 422.—An Act to allow Senators, Sen-
ators-elect, committees of the Senate, lead-

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we thank You for Your 
great blessings. Lord, we are grateful 
that though the arc of the moral uni-
verse is long, it bends toward justice. 
Continue to use our lawmakers to 
permit justice to roll down like waters 
and 
righteousness 
like 
a 
mighty 
stream. 
May our Senators trust Your pre-
vailing providence as they realize that 
behind the dim unknown, You stand 
within the shadows, keeping watch 
above Your own. 
Lord, be with all the families af-
fected by the Derek Chauvin trial. Be 
also with the many brave men and 
women who faithfully serve You in law 
enforcement. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

f 
TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, a jury of former police officer 
Derek Chauvin’s peers determined that 
he was guilty of murdering George 
Floyd, confirming what was plain to 
the millions of Americans who watched 
his murder on video—91⁄2 excruciating 
minutes that documented the senseless 
and unnecessary loss of one man’s life 
in broad daylight. 
Our country was forever changed by 
the horrendous video of Derek Chauvin 
killing Mr. Floyd. His searing final 
words, screaming for air, calling for his 
mother, are etched in our memory. 
This guilty verdict serves as an official 
proclamation of what so many of us 
have known for nearly a year: George 
Floyd was murdered by an officer who 
was sworn to protect and to serve but 
who, obviously, didn’t. 
The brutality of George Floyd’s mur-
der, yet another in a seemingly endless 
string of tragedies, sparked a summer 
of protest unlike any we have seen in 
American history, elevating a long- 
building movement for more justice in 
policing. Americans of every age, color, 
and creed took to the streets in peace-
ful protest—from Minneapolis to Maine 
and Los Angeles to Atlanta, and in-
cluding in my own home city of New 
York. A community of global citizens 
would soon join them in protest. In for-
eign capitals—from Rome, Paris, and 
London to Amsterdam, Berlin, and 
Mexico City—the name George Floyd 
would echo through the public square. 
This was not only a fight for justice 
but a fight against the mistreatment, 
discrimination, and outright bigotry 
that Black men and women suffer at 
the hands of State power, not just here 
in America but around the globe. 
The death of George Floyd provoked 
such a reaction because folks in those

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2090 
April 21, 2021 
communities knew a George Floyd of 
their own. Names of friends and col-
leagues who were tragically killed or 
suffered the brutal sting of racism 
sprang to their tongues. They still do. 
Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, 
Breonna Taylor, Trayvon Martin, Eric 
Garner, Daniel Prude, Sandra Bland— 
each circumstance different, the under-
lying tragedy much the same. Their 
names, and countless others, serve as a 
reminder that a single verdict in a sin-
gle trial will never be enough. 
It wasn’t long ago that excessive 
force by police was never caught on 
iPhones or body cameras. It was out of 
sight and often beyond the reach of the 
law, which gave almost reflexive def-
erence to police officers who were 
brought to trial, if they were ever 
brought to trial. 
So this was an important event for 
the American justice system. Not only 
were the events concerning George 
Floyd caught on camera, but the of-
fending officer was tried and convicted 
in a court of law. Let it serve as the 
proper 
deterrent—a 
deterrent 
that 
should have existed long ago—to the 
kind of egregious misconduct that led 
to George Floyd’s death. 
However, and most certainly, we 
should not mistake a guilty verdict in 
this case as evidence that the per-
sistent problem of police misconduct 
has been solved or that the divide be-
tween law enforcement and so many of 
the communities they serve has been 
bridged. It has not. 
We must remain diligent in our ef-
forts to bring meaningful change to po-
lice departments across the country, to 
reform practices and training, and the 
legal protections that grant too great a 
shield to police officers guilty of mis-
conduct. 
We also must remain diligent in 
striving to root out the racial bias in 
our society: in our healthcare system, 
in jobs, in housing, in the economy, in 
the boardroom and at the ballot box, 
on our streets, and in our schools. 
This goes way beyond party or polit-
ical faction. Racism strikes at the very 
core of this country. Justice—true jus-
tice—will not come until we finally 
banish the ancient poison of racism 
from the American soul. 
The Senate will continue that work 
as we strive to ensure that George 
Floyd’s tragic death will not be in 
vain. We will not rest until the Senate 
passes strong legislation to end this 
systemic bias in law enforcement. 
f 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on a related subject, part of that effort, 
though modest, is installing com-
mitted, 
experienced, 
compassionate 
civil rights leaders in positions of 
power in the Justice Department, our 
Nation’s top law enforcement Agency. 
It just so happens that, today, the Sen-
ate will vote on the confirmation of 
Ms. Vanita Gupta to be the next Asso-
ciate Attorney General. 
Not only is Ms. Gupta the first 
woman of color to ever be nominated 
to the position, she is the first civil 
rights attorney ever to be nominated 
to the position—the third ranking offi-
cial in the Justice Department. That is 
shocking, really. We never have had a 
former civil rights attorney serving in 
such a position of prominence at the 
Justice Department. In that sense 
alone, Ms. Gupta would bring a long 
overdue perspective to our Federal law 
enforcement Agency. 
Just to give you a sense of Ms. 
Gupta’s commitment to civil rights 
and racial equity, in her very first case 
after law school, she won the release of 
several African Americans who had 
been wrongly convicted by all-White 
juries in Texas. Her clients later won a 
full pardon from Texas Governor Rick 
Perry. 
At a time when our country needs to 
make strides against racial injustice, 
how can we not install one of the Na-
tion’s top civil rights lawyers at the 
Department of Justice? How can our 
colleagues not rise to the occasion— 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle—and vote for her? I am so, so 
troubled by the fact that they are vir-
tually unanimously against such a fine 
person who is needed so much at this 
time. 
Yes, but, unfortunately, Ms. Gupta 
might be the first nominee in this Con-
gress where the vote falls entirely 
down on party lines. I hope it doesn’t 
come to that. The effort to elevate 
highly qualified civil rights attorneys 
like Ms. Gupta should be bipartisan. 
I urge my colleagues—all of them, 
and particularly my friends on the 
other side of the aisle—to vote in favor 
of Ms. Gupta’s nomination today. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a 
different matter here, for nearly a cen-
tury, America’s national security and 
economic security has been grounded 
in our scientific and technological su-
periority, often supported by smart in-
vestments by the Federal Government. 
But in recent years, countries like 
China have closed the gap with the 
United States. If we fail to respond, 
they will overtake us, with drastic con-
sequences for our workers, businesses, 
allies, and partners around the world. 
It is long past time for the United 
States to make the next wave of in-
vestments to fix dangerous weak spots 
in our economy and preserve our place 
as the world leader in science and tech-
nology, which then leads to millions of 
good-paying jobs here in this country. 
So, today, I am proud to join with my 
friend the Republican Senator from In-
diana, Senator YOUNG, and several of 
my colleagues from both sides to re-
introduce the Endless Frontier Act. It 
is a big, bold, and bipartisan initiative 
to propel American science and tech-
nology into the 21st century. Let me 
stress that last point. This bill is bipar-
tisan. 
As Senator YOUNG and I have worked 
on the bill over the past several 
months, several Senators from both 
sides have been added as original co-
sponsors: six Democrats and six Repub-
licans. That is because there is a bipar-
tisan consensus that the United States 
must invest in the technologies of the 
future to outcompete China. Whichever 
nation develops new technologies first, 
be they democratic or authoritarian, 
will set the terms for their use. The 
stakes for personal privacy and per-
sonal liberties, as well as for national 
security, economic security, and mi-
nority rights around the globe, are 
simply enormous. 
So at the center of this legislation is 
a $100 billion investment in research, 
commercialization, 
and 
workforce 
training in the kinds of technology 
that will play an outsized role in the 
future—semiconductors, artificial in-
telligence, quantum computing, and 
5G, to name a few. 
Another $10 billion would foster the 
development 
of 
technological 
hubs 
around the country. We want to see 
Silicon Valleys across the country, 
from my home State of New York and 
upstate to communities in the South, 
to the Midwest, to other places that 
rarely get the attention they merit de-
spite the potential of their workforces, 
their institutions, and their links to 
the global economy. 
Technological growth in jobs should 
not be limited to a few centers in 
America, and this bill attempts to 
spread it to other communities as well. 
It will also strengthen the critical sup-
ply chains in the United States and 
with global allies and partners. The 
Endless Frontier Act is exactly what 
we need to reinvigorate American 
science and technology, to promote our 
national security, and to create the 
jobs of the future. 
I have committed to put a bipartisan, 
competitive-related bill on the floor of 
the Senate. The Endless Frontier Act 
will be a central part of that legisla-
tion. We will also push for emergency 
spending to implement the bipartisan 
semiconductor manufacturing provi-
sions in last year’s Defense bill. 
Another potential component, led by 
Senators Menendez and Risch, is being 
marked up in the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee this week. This is ex-
actly what our Republican colleagues 
have asked for when it comes to reg-
ular order. 
We are marking up bipartisan bills in 
committee and considering bipartisan 
amendments here on the floor. We have 
just seen this back process play out on 
the anti-Asian hate crimes bill this 
week, and next week we are going to 
follow it up with a water infrastructure 
bill that is also thoroughly bipartisan. 
Our efforts to cement another cen-
tury of American economic leadership 
should be no different—thoroughly bi-
partisan. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
early on, a major theme of the Biden 
administration has been false adver-
tising. We have the so-called COVID re-
lief bill that broke a long bipartisan 
streak on pandemic response and only 
spent 1 percent of the money on vac-
cinations. 
We have the reintroduction of a 
sprawling election takeover bill that 
Democrats wrote years ago under the 
guise that it is a commonsense voting 
rights bill. 
We have a President who ran on pro-
tecting norms flirting with proposals 
to hot-wire the Senate rules and pack 
the Supreme Court. And then we have 
the latest example, where even one Ivy 
League expert says Democrats’ spin 
‘‘does a bit of violence to the English 
language.’’ They have assembled a 
patchwork of leftwing social engineer-
ing programs and want to label it ‘‘in-
frastructure.’’ 
Now, as I pointed out before, the first 
notable thing about the Biden adminis-
tration’s plan is what it doesn’t focus 
on. Less than 6 percent of the alleged 
infrastructure bill would invest in 
roads and bridges. The total amount of 
funding it would direct to roads, 
bridges, ports, waterways, and airports 
combined—all together—adds up to less 
than what it would spend just on elec-
tric cars. 
The far left sees a strong family re-
semblance between these proposals and 
their socialist Green New Deal. Yester-
day, the House and Senate authors of 
that manifesto reintroduced it, while 
noting and boasting that the DNA of 
the Green New Deal is all over Presi-
dent Biden’s legislative proposals. No 
wonder that White House’s document 
rolling out the President’s bill men-
tioned 
the 
words 
‘‘climate’’ 
and 
‘‘union’’ more often than ‘‘roads’’ and 
‘‘bridges.’’ 
It would pick winners and losers in 
automotive manufacturing. It would 
force-feed the electrical grid some of 
the least reliable forms of energy. It 
would hector school cafeterias to stop 
using paper plates and force new stand-
ards and mandates on family homes. 
And the relative pittance this pro-
posal does allocate to actual infra-
structure would have to creep through 
a tangled environmental review proc-
ess. Without serious permitting reform, 
it won’t build back better; it will build 
back never. 
But at least some of these bad ideas 
have a tangential relationship to the 
actual concept of infrastructure, not so 
for some other statements we have 
heard from actual Democrats in recent 
days: 
Climate action is infrastructure. 
Police accountability is infrastructure. 
Caregiving is infrastructure. 
Supreme Court expansion is infrastructure. 
Now, unsurprisingly, this liberal om-
nibus is not exactly an efficient engine 
for driving our economy. The White 
House’s inflated claims of expected job 
creation have been fact-checked and 
received Pinocchios from the Wash-
ington Post. 
Even under the rosiest scholarly as-
sumptions—the rosiest assumptions— 
the White House’s own favored esti-
mates, taxpayers would pay more than 
$800,000 for each job the plan might cre-
ate. Now, I know a lot of small busi-
nesses that could create more than one 
job if we handed them $800,000. 
And then there are the tax hikes. 
This proposal is a Trojan horse to roll 
back the historic 2017 tax reform plan 
that helped spur big-time wage growth 
and the best job market in a genera-
tion before COVID–19. So the adminis-
tration’s proposal bears little resem-
blance to the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill Americans need and deserve. It just 
reads like customer service for the rad-
ical fringe. 
f 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, over the past few 
months, Senate Republicans have made 
clear we believe a President is entitled 
to choose qualified, mainstream nomi-
nees to staff the executive branch and 
receive prompt and fair treatment 
from the Senate. I would say the 50 
Senate Republicans have treated Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees considerably 
more fairly than Senate Democrats 
treated the last President’s, but the 
nominee we are considering this week 
is way outside the mainstream. 
I will strongly oppose confirming 
Vanita Gupta to serve as Associate At-
torney General, and I would urge col-
leagues to do the same. Ms. Gupta has 
spent her career, in large part, as an 
activist for leftwing causes. Her work 
for high-profile liberal interest groups 
and the Obama Justice Department 
have left a record of astoundingly rad-
ical positions. Those far-left positions 
were loud and proud until this prospect 
of promotion seemed to change the 
nominee’s tune. 
Previously, this nominee stated that 
‘‘states should decriminalize simple 
possession of all drugs.’’ She said 
‘‘states should decriminalize simple 
possession of all drugs.’’ Ah, but now 
Ms. Gupta claims her position has 
‘‘evolved.’’ 
At her confirmation hearing, she re-
fused to say she would accept any— 
any—limitation on abortions, up to 
and including partial-birth. That puts 
her at odds with nearly 70 percent of 
Americans across the political spec-
trum. 
Recently, Ms. Gupta has insisted she 
can be trusted to oppose efforts to 
defund law enforcement, but she told 
the Judiciary Committee just last year 
that State and local leaders should 
‘‘heed calls’’ from groups demanding 
that they decrease—decrease—police 
budgets. 
This 
nomination 
has 
revealed 
a 
lengthy trail of radical claims and 
hasty backtracks, but there are also 
questions of temperament. The nomi-
nee has repeatedly amplified leftwing 
fearmongering toward judicial nomi-
nees and sitting Federal judges. She 
has levied ad hominem attacks on 
Members of this body. And during the 
confirmation process, she employed the 
loosest possible interpretation of her 
oath to deliver honest testimony, even 
drawing the ire of the liberal Wash-
ington Post for transparent flip-flops 
and misleading Senators about her own 
public statements. 
This nominee contrasts sharply— 
sharply—with the resume and reputa-
tion of Attorney General Garland, 
whom I voted to confirm. The White 
House needs to make a better choice 
for this key post. The Senate should 
create that opportunity by voting no 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2092 
April 21, 2021 
isn’t even old-fashioned thinking. It 
isn’t in tune with the times in Amer-
ica. It doesn’t reflect reality. 
For the Republicans to argue that 
unless it is bricks and mortar, the gov-
ernment shouldn’t be involved in build-
ing it for the good of the economy and 
the strength of business and good-pay-
ing jobs really is sinking their head 
deep into the sand. 
And I think we ought to make a 
record, at least for the moment, that in 
the last 4 years of the last Presidential 
administration, there were no infra-
structure bills—none. After all the 
promises of the Trump campaign and 
what he would bring, nothing hap-
pened—nothing. So to be lectured by 
the Republicans about what infrastruc-
ture is all about is to suggest to them 
that they missed a golden opportunity 
to help America, and we are not going 
to miss it. 
To think that the Republican defini-
tion of infrastructure in America does 
not include the expansion of broadband 
coverage across this Nation—what are 
they thinking? Their minds are back 10 
and 20 years ago. 
Is broadband coverage for all Ameri-
cans in every corner of this country a 
socialist idea to the Republicans? I 
think it is a commonsense idea to the 
people of America. They know it when 
their kids have laptops, and they have 
to sit in the parking lot of a library or 
next to a McDonald’s or Starbucks in 
order to get access. They know what 
that means to their child, to their stu-
dent in terms of their progress. Busi-
nesses know it too. 
Try to advertise some section of 
America without access to broadband 
coverage to locate a new business. It is 
a laughing matter, and we know it. 
So when President Biden suggests 
that broadband is part of infrastruc-
ture in America and then he is mocked 
as being a socialist by the Republicans, 
we have a clear definition of where the 
party values are today. 
When it comes to other basic things, 
the 
Senator 
from 
Kentucky 
just 
doesn’t empathize with what families 
go through to put people on the job. It 
isn’t just a matter of finding a good job 
and being qualified to fill that job. 
There is also a family concern—a fam-
ily concern that can literally make a 
difference as to whether you take that 
job. 
The 
Democrats 
believe 
that 
childcare—affordable 
quality 
childcare—is part of the equation in 
terms of good-paying jobs being filled 
by Americans, where families want to 
be sure their kids are safe. 
Is that socialism? Is that another ex-
ample of socialism for the Repub-
licans—quality daycare, affordable for 
families? It is not socialism in my 
book. It is a family value. That is why 
I think the efforts of the Republicans 
to run down President Biden’s at-
tempts to strengthen this economy 
really are antiquated and perhaps not 
in the best interest of this country. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. President, we will be voting in a 
few minutes on Vanita Gupta. 
Yesterday was a day that many 
Americans will never forget with the 
decision in a trial in Minnesota, care-
fully watched by millions across Amer-
ica and around the world. The death of 
George Floyd was a stark moment, 
when one piece of videotape has been 
emblazoned in the minds of people in 
the United States and around the 
world. 
Under the knee of Officer Chauvin, 
George Floyd lost his life on a street in 
Minneapolis. Whether there would be 
accountability and justice as a result 
was an unanswered question until yes-
terday, and the answer came through 
loud and clear. The jury spoke, and jus-
tice was served. And now we have a re-
sponsibility to move forward. 
The reason I make reference to that 
in light of the nomination of Vanita 
Gupta is the fact that the path to civil 
rights progress in America is often dif-
ficult and, for those who try to lead, 
often a lonely battle. 
Vanita Gupta has taken more than 
her fair share of criticism from the Re-
publican side of the aisle. I sometimes 
find it hard to believe that this amaz-
ing, outstanding, remarkable young 
woman is being degraded by so many 
Republicans when she comes to the 
floor for consideration by the Senate. 
She has a record that is incredible. 
She is the right person for this job in 
the Department of Justice as Associate 
Attorney General. She is unquestion-
ably well-qualified. She would be the 
first civil rights attorney and the first 
woman of color to be an Associate At-
torney General. And, you know, I think 
that is at the heart of the problem as 
far as some Republicans are concerned. 
They are just not ready for that kind 
of change. Well, they should be. 
Anybody who has turned on the news 
in the last week has seen that we need 
police reform in this country. We need 
to repair the relationship between law 
enforcement and the communities they 
serve. 
Vanita Gupta has a proven track 
record of doing just that. As head of 
the Justice Department’s Civil Rights 
Division, she led efforts to reform po-
lice departments across the Nation, 
and she did it in a way that brought 
people together: civil rights advocates, 
community leaders, and police and law 
enforcement. As a result, she has in-
credibly broad support. 
When 
I 
hear 
them 
talk 
about 
defunding the police and how she is 
anti-police, how in the world do the Re-
publicans explain the fact that she has 
the support of every major law enforce-
ment group in this country? They just 
conveniently ignore that fact. If any-
thing 
they 
said 
were 
true—really 
true—do you think that the Fraternal 
Order of Police would be standing be-
hind her, as well as the civil rights 
community? 
Consider this statement from the 
Federal Law Enforcement Association. 
They said: ‘‘Ms. Gupta has a proven 
history of working with law enforce-
ment agencies, corrections officials, 
advocates, stakeholders, and elected 
officials 
across 
the 
political 
spec-
trum.’’ 
That is an incredible statement for 
an attorney—a civil rights attorney— 
who has not shied away from the bat-
tle, has walked into the most con-
troversial situations in her time, and 
has proven over and over that she can 
not only just get the job done but she 
can do it to the satisfaction of both 
sides believing she was fair in the proc-
ess. 
She has the support of outstanding 
conservatives like Grover Norquist, Mi-
chael 
Chertoff, 
and 
Mark 
Holden, 
former counsel of Koch Industries. 
I listened to the Republicans’ base-
less charges and smears against Ms. 
Gupta last week, and I find it amazing 
that they can ignore every law enforce-
ment group that supports her and 
every leading conservative spokesman 
who has come out for her. 
She has been the head of the Depart-
ment’s Civil Rights Division. She led 
efforts to prosecute human trafficking, 
combat religious discrimination, pro-
tect the rights of men and women in 
uniform, and to ensure that members 
of our military are not taken advan-
tage of. 
She has a career as a civil rights law-
yer. This book tells the story. Six 
months out of law school, working for 
the Legal Defense Fund, she ended up 
taking an assignment in Tulia, TX. 
Why did she take this assignment? Be-
cause, when she did, there were some 40 
people who had been arrested in this 
town. One out of every five Black 
adults in town was behind bars, all ac-
cused of dealing cocaine to the same 
undercover officer, Tom Coleman. 
Coleman, the son of a well-known 
Texas ranger, had been named ‘‘Officer 
of the Year’’ in Texas. Not until after 
the 
trials 
in 
which 
Coleman’s 
uncorroborated testimony secured sen-
tences as long as 361 years—that is not 
a typo, 361 years—did it become appar-
ent that Mr. Coleman had misrepre-
sented his own qualifications and, 
sadly, misrepresented all of the cases 
before him. 
Two dozen people were in prison, 
most of them African Americans. The 
town of Tulia had become a battlefield 
in the national debate over the war on 
drugs. And who was sent into this to 
represent the civil rights of those sit-
ting in jail, who had been wrongly con-
victed? Vanita Gupta. Six months out 
of law school, she went down to Texas. 
I would imagine that, 6 months out 
of law school, I was still searching for 
the right place to eat lunch with a 
partner in a firm—but not her. She 
went down there and became an out-
standing advocate. And what happened 
as a result? As a result of her efforts 
and the efforts of other civil rights at-
torneys and the courage they showed, 
the determination they showed, the 
Republican Governor of Texas, Perry,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2093 
April 21, 2021 
ended up pardoning every one of these 
criminal defendants and authorized the 
payment of millions of dollars in com-
pensation for their damages. 
And so when we hear from the Repub-
licans that she is not ready for prime 
time, she is too radical, she can’t han-
dle this job, we are all going to vote 
against her—and they have—you think 
to yourself: Did they ever take a 
minute to read what she has done with 
her life, time and time again? 
I will tell you, it is incredible to me 
that we are at this moment in history 
that a woman of color with an extraor-
dinary civil rights record wants to 
make history in the Department of 
Justice, wants to continue to serve this 
Nation, representing our government 
and prosecuting cases for the American 
people, that she is prepared to take her 
experience and expertise and sit down 
and try to help us solve these monu-
mental challenges we currently face 
and can’t get a single Republican to 
stand in support—not one. It is hard to 
imagine. 
Well, as I mentioned before, she has 
tackled tough assignments before suc-
cessfully in the cause of the name of 
justice. The Justice Department, her 
service there, the Tulia case, which 
many don’t want to talk about, has 
been true throughout her career. She is 
guided by an unshakable belief in up-
holding the rule of law and vindicating 
the rights of those who are too fre-
quently 
taken 
advantage 
of, 
marginalized, and forgotten. 
To Vanita Gupta, the people who 
have suffered discrimination in this 
country matter. She has dedicated her 
life to that. It troubles some. It wran-
gles them. It makes them angry, but 
the fact of the matter is, she is an ex-
traordinary, 
essentially 
amazing 
woman in my estimation. 
She has demonstrated already what 
kind of leader she is, what kind of 
courage she had 6 months out of law 
school to go to Tulia, TX, and to rep-
resent people already serving time in 
jail, who were ultimately released. 
She also has a proven record of bipar-
tisanship, a record of working with law 
enforcement and community leaders, 
and a record of upholding the rule of 
law. 
In just a few minutes—3 or 4 min-
utes—the Senate will get a chance to 
advance her nomination, and perhaps 
several hours after that, we will finally 
give her the vote of confidence she de-
serves to join the Department of Jus-
tice, Merrick Garland, and now Lisa 
Monaco, who is being sworn in today, 
and be part of the team that heard the 
message in Minnesota yesterday and is 
prepared to move forward to make 
America a better place for all, a better 
place for opportunity and equality and 
real justice. 
We need the right people in the De-
partment of Justice at this moment in 
history more than ever in current 
memory, and we have the beginnings of 
that team with our Attorney General 
and with Lisa Monaco. Vanita Gupta 
should join them. She should be able, 
the day after tomorrow or even sooner, 
if possible, to be sworn into office and 
have this opportunity to continue her 
service to the Department of Justice 
and the cause of justice. That, to me, is 
indicated by her background and by 
the endorsement she has faced. 
When you hear the bad comments 
about her from the other side of the 
aisle, pause and think for a moment: 
But, Senator, if she is so bad, why did 
all of the law enforcement groups in 
America support her? Why do all the 
civil rights organizations support her? 
Why does she have the support of so 
many conservatives, even in the busi-
ness community, if she is as bad as you 
say she is? 
The honest answer is she is not. She 
is a quality individual with remarkable 
credentials and a remarkable wealth of 
experience that she wants to continue 
to bring to our government. I hope the 
Senate will give her that opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks before the vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is an-
other day and another manufactured 
crisis. Yesterday, I came down to the 
floor to talk about the supposed crisis 
of confidence in the Supreme Court 
that requires us to immediately add 
four additional Democrat-chosen Jus-
tices. 
Today, I want to talk about another 
manufactured crisis, and that is the 
supposed election crisis that requires 
us to pass H.R. 1, a Democrat piece of 
legislation designed to increase Demo-
crats’ chances of maintaining their 
current tenuous hold on power. 
H.R. 1 is not new legislation. Demo-
crats introduced a nearly identical 
version of this bill in the last Congress 
as well. Back then, we were told that 
we needed this bill to address profound 
electoral problems in our democracy— 
in other words, Democrats didn’t like 
the results of the 2016 elections. 
Then, of course, last year, we had an 
election with record voter turnout—the 
highest voter turnout since 1900—an 
election that gave Democrats the Pres-
idency and paper-thin majorities in 
Congress, and the story changed. Now 
we are told that we need to pass H.R. 1 
and federalize elections because legis-
latures around the country are passing 
‘‘voter suppression’’ laws. 
The State of Georgia recently passed 
an election reform measure—a law that 
keeps Georgia squarely in the main-
stream when it comes to State election 
laws. 
The Speaker of the Georgia House of 
Representatives noted yesterday in tes-
timony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee that while Georgia has 
made its no-excuse absentee voting 
more secure with this law, States like 
Delaware and New York—among many 
others—don’t even allow no-excuse vot-
ing. 
Delaware, of course, is the home 
State of the President of the United 
States. New York is the home State of 
the Democratic leader. I haven’t no-
ticed the President or the Democratic 
leader criticizing their home States for 
voter suppression. Nevertheless, Demo-
crats decided that the Georgia measure 
would serve as a useful rallying cry for 
H.R. 1, so they spread a web of misin-
formation and outright lies, attempt-
ing to get people worked up by por-
traying Georgia’s fairly ordinary elec-
tion reform laws as a radical attempt 
to suppress voters and to suppress 
votes. 
President Biden irresponsibly de-
scribed the law as ‘‘Jim Crow on 
steroids,’’ as if the Georgia Legislature 
had decided to reinstate the evil of seg-
regation. The President has been re-
peatedly rebuked by none other than 
the Washington Post for repeating a 
completely false claim about the Geor-
gia law. In fact, the Washington Post 
gave the President four Pinocchios—a 
rating that the Post reserves for 
‘‘whoppers’’—for his false claim that 
the law is designed to keep working 
Americans from voting. In fact, as the 
Post’s Fact Checker piece makes clear, 
there is reason to think the law might 
actually—wait for it, Mr. President— 
expand access to early voting. 
A fair-minded piece in the New York 
Times, hardly a newspaper that carries 
water for Republicans, concluded that 
the voting provisions of the Georgia 
law are ‘‘unlikely to significantly af-
fect turnout or Democratic chances.’’ 
But that hasn’t stopped Democrats 
from using Georgia’s law as the poster 
child for supposed voter suppression 
and the pressing reason to pass H.R. 1. 
Let’s talk about the substance of 
H.R. 1. To start with, this legislation 
would transfer control over elections 
from States to the Federal Government 
despite the fact that the Constitution 
gives primary control over elections to 
the States. Under this law, States’ 
ability to develop election systems 
that address the needs and challenges 
facing their States would be substan-
tially limited. 
Of course, Democrats would like us 
to believe that this Federal power grab 
is urgently needed since, they argue, 
States are contemplating voter sup-
pression laws, but as I pointed out, the 
last election, with its record turnout— 
the largest turnout since 1900—did not 
exactly suggest that States are incapa-
ble of setting their own election rules. 
Ironically, H.R. 1, which purports to 
be an election integrity bill, would ac-
tually undermine election integrity. 
The bill takes aim at State voter ID 
laws—a longtime obsession, I might 
add, of the Democrats. I have always 
been at a loss to understand Demo-
crats’ passionate opposition to requir-
ing people to provide identification be-
fore voting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2094 
April 21, 2021 
Democrats, of course, present voter 
ID laws as an attempt to suppress votes 
by forcing people to go through a chal-
lenging process of obtaining a govern-
ment ID. I have to ask if Democrats 
also think laws requiring ID to drive 
are somehow discriminatory. We con-
stantly require photo identification in 
our society to drive, to board planes, to 
enter many government buildings, to 
pick up tickets to Major League base-
ball games. These requirements are 
pretty universally accepted. It is dif-
ficult to understand how requiring 
identification to vote is so outrageous. 
The American people don’t seem to 
think so. Polls show that a majority of 
Americans support voter ID laws. 
In addition to effectively eliminating 
State voter ID requirements, H.R. 1 
also requires that States allow ballot 
harvesting, the controversial practice 
of allowing political operatives to col-
lect and submit ballots. Needless to 
say, ballot harvesting opens up a lot of 
questions about voter fraud and elec-
tion integrity, but the Democrats’ bill 
would require it. 
As I mentioned, Democrats intro-
duced an almost identical version of 
H.R. 1 in the last Congress, and—get 
this—the ACLU opposed it. The ACLU 
opposed it. That is right. The American 
Civil Liberties Union opposed it. Why? 
Because the bill would ‘‘unconsti-
tutionally 
burden 
speech 
and 
associational rights.’’ Unconstitution-
ally burden speech and associational 
rights. H.R. 1 would impose a vast new 
array of restrictions on political speech 
and issue advocacy, and it would im-
pose disclosure requirements for orga-
nizations that would open up donors to 
retaliation and intimidation. 
I could fill up several speeches with a 
discussion of all the bad provisions in 
this bill. H.R. 1 would turn the FEC, 
the Federal Election Commission, into 
a partisan body. It would require tax-
payer funding of political campaigns. 
Taxpayer dollars would go to fund 
bumper stickers and political ads. It 
would allow the IRS to deny tax-ex-
empt status to organizations whose po-
sitions it doesn’t like and on and on. 
Then there is the fact that on a pure-
ly practical level, this bill would be a 
disaster. A recent Daily Beast article 
highlighted the onerous and impos-
sible-to-meet requirements the bill im-
poses 
on 
conducting 
elections. 
To 
quote the Daily Beast, another media 
outlet not exactly known for its favor-
itism toward conservative Republicans, 
the bill ‘‘was written with apparently 
no consultation with election adminis-
trators, and it shows . . . it comes 
packed with deadlines and require-
ments election administrators cannot 
possibly meet without throwing their 
systems into chaos.’’ 
The article goes on to say: 
The sections of the bill relating to voting 
systems . . . show remarkably little under-
standing of the problems the authors apply 
alarmingly prescriptive solutions to. Many 
of the changes the bill demands of election 
administrators are literally impossible to 
implement. 
That, again, is from the Daily Beast. 
Like the Democrats’ Supreme Court 
power grab, H.R. 1 is a solution in 
search of a problem. Protecting the 
right to vote and preserving the integ-
rity of our election systems are essen-
tial. While we are fortunate that our 
electoral system by and large seems to 
be operating well, there are certainly 
measures that we can take up to fur-
ther enhance election integrity. H.R. 1 
is not one of those measures. This leg-
islation is an unacceptable Federal 
takeover of elections that would under-
mine election integrity and substan-
tially curtail First Amendment rights. 
Every 
single 
Member 
of 
Congress 
should be opposing it.

The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Texas. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my 
friend the Republican leader likes to 
remind us, the Senate is not just a leg-
islative body; we are also in the per-
sonnel business. One of the Senate’s 
core responsibilities is to provide ad-
vice and consent for the President’s 
nominees for a range of important jobs 
throughout the Federal Government. 
In fact, it is a constitutional duty of 
the Senate to perform that function. 
When the President is of the opposing 
party, there is all but a guarantee that 
you will not see eye to eye with every 
nominee, but the process isn’t just 
about politics or judging nominees 
based on whether their opinions align 
with your own. As I see it, we are 
charged with evaluating these individ-
uals to see if they are qualified not 
only to carry out the duties of their po-
sition but will also do so with honor 
and integrity. 
Take Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land, for example. When the Senate 
considered his nomination, it became 
clear that he had both the experience 
and the temperament to lead the De-
partment of Justice. Do we agree on 
everything? No. But he committed to 
do everything in his power to keep pol-
itics out of the Department of Justice, 
and I have no reason to doubt his credi-
bility. 
The same could be said of the Presi-
dent’s nominee for Deputy Attorney 
General, Lisa Monaco, who was con-
firmed yesterday by the Senate. Ms. 
Monaco is a longtime public servant 
who previously served for 15 years at 
the Department of Justice. Throughout 
her career, she has earned the respect 
of folks on both sides of the aisle, and 
I believe she will bring a wealth of ex-
perience and institutional knowledge 
to the Department. 
So my point is, I have supported the 
majority of President Biden’s nominees 
thus far, and every single nominee has 
received bipartisan support at some 
level. But unfortunately, it looks like 
we are about ready to break that 
record of bipartisanship. 
Today, the Senate will vote on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2095 
April 21, 2021 
Associate Attorney General, the third 
highest official at the Department of 
Justice. Unlike previous nominees who 
have received bipartisan support, there 
is not a single person on this side of 
the aisle who believes that Ms. Gupta 
is fit to serve as the third in command 
at the Department of Justice. 
I can’t predict what the final vote 
will be. It will be at 2:30. But I hear no-
body on this side of the aisle saying she 
is an exemplar of the type of person 
who should serve in the Department of 
Justice. 
As I said, this is not about politics; 
nor are those of us who are opposed to 
her nomination opposed because of her 
gender or race. To the contrary, those 
are irrelevant. Instead, the lack of sup-
port for Ms. Gupta is a result of her 
radical record far outside the main-
stream and her career as a partisan ac-
tivist. In fact, she has championed rad-
ical policies basically all of her profes-
sional career. 
In addition, throughout the con-
firmation process, Ms. Gupta was asked 
about the long, long list of controver-
sial, misleading, and sometimes out-
right false public statements that she 
has made in the past—her statement 
before the Judiciary last summer, for 
example, that we should effectively 
defund the police; her op-ed that ar-
gued we should effectively revoke 
qualified immunity for law enforce-
ment in civil lawsuits; but worst of all 
were her prior statements on drug pol-
icy. 
In 2012, Ms. Gupta wrote in an op-ed 
in the Huffington Post that ‘‘States 
should decriminalize simple possession 
of all drugs.’’ ‘‘All drugs.’’ This is obvi-
ously an incredibly controversial state-
ment and way out of step with most 
Americans’ views, for good reason. 
What she said is, as long as they were 
small amounts, she would legalize her-
oin, fentanyl, cocaine, ecstasy, meth-
amphetamine, you name it. 
When Ms. Gupta tried to distance 
herself from these previous positions 
that are published in black and white, 
here is what the Washington Post Fact 
Checker said: 
For 
this 
tango 
of 
previously 
unacknowledged flip-flops, Gupta earns an 
Upside-Down Pinocchio. 
Now I have seen a one Pinocchio, two 
Pinocchio, three Pinocchio, even a 
four, but I have never seen an upside- 
down Pinocchio for a ‘‘tango of pre-
viously 
unacknowledged 
flip-flops.’’ 
The Fact Check examined Ms. Gupta’s 
confusing then and now statements on 
police budgets, qualified immunity, 
and drug policy, and that is what they 
found. 
Now, I understand and respect the 
fact that people’s opinions can change 
over time. As we learn new information 
or have different experiences in life, we 
all understand that one’s views can 
change. But there is a big difference be-
tween honestly forming a new opinion 
and undergoing a confirmation conver-
sion to bury radical views on con-
troversial subjects. After all, how could 
anyone support a nominee who advo-
cated 
the 
decriminalization 
of 
all 
drugs, especially for the No. 3 spot at 
the Department of Justice? I am not 
sure anyone in this Chamber, Repub-
lican or Democrat, could support some-
one to serve in the upper echelon of the 
Justice Department who supported the 
legalization of heroin, fentanyl, and 
other dangerous street narcotics. That 
is why she attempted to whitewash it. 
She knew she couldn’t get nominated, 
much less confirmed, if she didn’t. 
But here is what we know about drug 
abuse in America. This is a map of na-
tional opioid death rates in America. 
As you can see, they go from the dark 
colors, which is where the death rate is 
29 to 43 per 100,000 population, to the 
slightly lighter range, which is 20 to 29, 
roughly, people per 100,000, and then 
the lighter ones, obviously, until you 
get to the lowest one, which is 3.5 to 
10.9. 
Every community in America has 
felt the pain and anguish from the 
opioid crisis. In 2019, there were more 
than 70,000 overdose deaths in America. 
There were 70,000 Americans who lost 
their lives. We are still waiting on 
complete figures from 2020, but pre-
liminary 
data 
shows 
things 
are 
trending in the wrong direction. From 
June 2019 through May 2020, more than 
81,000 Americans have died from drug 
overdoses. 
Fighting the opioid epidemic is a 
cause every person in this Chamber can 
get behind because, as you can see, 
each of our States has been impacted. 
In 2016, thanks to the hard work of a 
bipartisan group of Senators, we passed 
what became known as the CARA Act— 
the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act—to help more Americans 
break this devastating cycle of drug 
use, drug abuse, and overdose, and we 
appropriated tens of billions of dollars 
to fight this scourge. 
As I said and as you can see, no State 
has been spared the pain and suffering 
from the opioid epidemic, but we do 
know some have been hit harder than 
others. For example, one of the States, 
with the darkest color, with the high-
est rate of overdose deaths is Ohio. And 
we can see here what had happened in 
the period, roughly, from 2009 to 2019. 
From 2009 to 2019, 10 years, there 
were more than 33,000 drug overdoses 
and deaths in Ohio alone—33,000 Ohio-
ans, each with their unique value, con-
tribution, and story. It is an absolutely 
heartbreaking number of deaths that 
should have been prevented. 
Another one of those States with the 
worst problems with opioids was New 
Hampshire. In 2013, the drug overdose 
deaths per capita were slightly above 
the national average, at 15 deaths per 
100,000. In New Hampshire, in 2016, just 
3 years later, the death rate increased 
158 percent. 
First responders across New Hamp-
shire experienced a dramatic increase 
in the calls they got for overdoses so 
they started carrying Narcan, a medi-
cation used to reverse an overdose if 
you get there in time before the 
overdosed individual dies. They carry 
them in their emergency gear because 
these overdose calls became so com-
mon. 
Another one of those States hit par-
ticularly hard is West Virginia. In 2019, 
West Virginia had the highest overdose 
deaths per capita. For every 100,000 
population, more than 52 were from an 
overdose, double the national figure. 
That is 21.6 per 100,000 that went up— 
that is the national—and the West Vir-
ginia number is double, as you can see. 
Our friend Senator CAPITO has been a 
tireless advocate for West Virginia 
families, many of whom have felt the 
pain of this crisis firsthand. She re-
cently wrote an op-ed about this nomi-
nee and the contradictory and con-
founding statements she has made in 
the past, particularly on drug policy. 
Senator CAPITO wrote: 
It’s hard to imagine the level of devasta-
tion [that] we would see if all of these drugs 
actually were legalized. And, it’s even harder 
to imagine that a nominee for a critical law 
enforcement position would hold this view. 
I completely agree with our friend 
from West Virginia. Given the ruin 
that the opioid epidemic has dealt in 
communities across the country, I 
can’t even begin to imagine how much 
worse it would be had the States heed-
ed Ms. Gupta’s call to decriminalize all 
drugs for personal use. If fentanyl, her-
oin, 
methamphetamine, 
and 
other 
highly addictive drugs were decrimi-
nalized, how many more Americans 
would become addicted? How many 
more would have died? How many more 
families would suffer the loss of a 
child? a sibling? a parent? 
I am profoundly concerned by Ms. 
Gupta’s prior statements on drug pol-
icy, as well as her radical statements 
on defunding the police, disarming the 
police in civil lawsuits by eliminating 
qualified 
immunity, 
abolishing 
the 
death penalty for the most heinous 
crimes, and so much more. 
Worse, though, is her inability to be 
honest about her position on issues 
that would directly fall within her pur-
view at the Department of Justice. The 
American people deserve to know that 
leaders at any government Department 
or Agency—but especially the Depart-
ment of Justice—they deserve to know 
that these public servants are honest 
and will tell them the truth. As Ms. 
Gupta’s upside-down Pinocchio indi-
cates, no Senator can have the con-
fidence that Ms. Gupta would be honest 
with them or tell them the truth. 
We hold hearings. We put witnesses 
under oath promising to tell the truth, 
the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth, so help me God, and we don’t ex-
pect people will come into those hear-
ings and lie. We ask followup ques-
tions. Perhaps there was some mis-
understanding that you would like to 
clear up. 
Believe it or not, Ms. Gupta answered 
a written question under oath stating 
that she had never advocated for the 
decriminalization of all drugs, even

though in 2012, in an op-ed she pub-
lished in the Huff Post, she did exactly 
that. But then, for some reason, she de-
cided to lie about it under oath to the 
U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. If 
she would lie to us, she would lie to 
you. And I fail to see how, for some 
reason, we think she will change the 
way she acts or behaves or improve her 
standard of behavior when it comes to 
honesty and truthfulness. We hold 
these hearings and ask these questions 
to understand the opinions and the 
character and the motivation of these 
nominees. But based on what the Sen-
ate has learned about Vanita Gupta, I 
don’t believe she is fit to serve as the 
Associate Attorney General. 
The Department of Justice, perhaps 
more than any other Department or 
Agency, must be led by men and 
women of honesty and integrity, people 
like Merrick Garland and people like 
Lisa 
Monaco 
who 
received 
over-
whelming bipartisan votes here on the 
Senate floor. High-ranking public offi-
cials at the Department of Justice can-
not be motivated by partisanship. They 
must pursue no other agenda other 
than fair and impartial justice. 
In contrast, Ms. Gupta has shown she 
is a partisan activist with a penchant 
for skirting the truth. If confirmed as 
Associate Attorney General, I believe 
she has the potential to use the power-
ful tools at the Department of Justice 
to wage partisan warfare that has been 
part of her professional career to this 
point. If we can’t trust her to be honest 
with us, how can we expect her to ful-
fill her duty of candor in courtrooms, 
including all aspects of the legal proc-
ess that depend on honest, truthful an-
swers and communications. 
If we can’t depend on her to tell the 
truth at the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee in the confirmation hearing, 
how can we depend on her to exercise 
her duty of candor when applying for a 
warrant from the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court, for example. 
Sadly, I believe Ms. Gupta will be a 
clear and present danger to the Amer-
ican people if she is given the muscle 
and might of the Department of Jus-
tice, as well as the entire Federal Gov-
ernment of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I cannot support her nomination, and 
I would urge all of my colleagues to do 
likewise. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has 
been many years ago that I went to law 
school, and I still remember some of 
the courses and some of the teachers 
and certainly some of my grades. One 
of the most interesting courses that 
should have been required of every stu-
dent in every law school in America ba-
sically was about this document, this 
Constitution, because in its simplicity, 
you are sometimes put off by the fact 
that there is real wisdom behind the 
words, and applying them in real life 
can take twists and turns. I found one 
way, a quick course in constitutional 
law, where average people come to un-
derstand the Bill of Rights better than 
most, and I found this when I was prac-
ticing law in Springfield, IL. 
I would get a telephone call from a 
parent who would say to me: Durbin, 
you have got to help me. They arrested 
my 17-year-old son for possession of 
marijuana. What are his rights under 
the Constitution? Did they give him a 
Miranda warning? 
I started hearing things from parents 
coming back to me about this docu-
ment, which I was surprised—surprised 
to hear. The point I am trying to make 
is this: The many years ago when I was 
practicing law in Springfield, IL, we 
were going through a learning process 
about drugs and addiction, and it has 
continued to this day. In fact, I don’t 
believe there is a single Senator on ei-
ther side of the aisle who would say: 
You know, I have been here 20 years or 
plus, and I have never changed my 
views on drugs. Maybe some feel that 
way. I am not one of them. 
There have been dramatic changes in 
the American attitude toward drugs. I 
think we know that, obviously. There 
have been changes in many States. In 
my State of Illinois, I think about that 
parent who called so many years ago— 
in a State where the sale and posses-
sion of marijuana and products made 
with marijuana is now legal and taxed. 
Things have changed dramatically 
when it comes to drugs. There are very 
few people who hold to the old school, 
which says: Simple possession of one 
marijuana cigarette, and we are going 
to put you in jail and throw away the 
key. 
No, it has changed a lot. In fact, it 
has changed in Washington so much so 
that there was a bill called the FIRST 
STEP Act. The FIRST STEP Act was a 
bill that I worked on with Senator 
GRASSLEY and Senator LEE and Sen-
ator BOOKER, who is here today, that 
basically said: We are changing our at-
titude toward drugs. Simple possession 
of a small amount of drugs will not re-
quire a mandatory minimum sentence 
because we have seen the terrible out-
come otherwise. 
We put that bill together on a bipar-
tisan 
basis, 
and 
President 
Donald 
Trump signed the bill into law. He not 
only signed it but came before us in the 
State of the Union Address and was 
proud of the fact that he had changed 
and reformed drug laws. 
So when I hear the arguments made 
on the floor that perhaps some nomi-
nee 
coming 
before 
us 
may 
have 
changed her or his opinion on drugs as, 
say, America has, by and large, think 
about what has happened with this 
opioid crisis now that it is no longer 
just an—I say ‘‘just,’’ underlined—an 
inner-city crime but a crime that af-
fects families who live in wealthy sub-
urbs. We now are looking at addiction 
so differently. 
So let’s go to this issue of Vanita 
Gupta and her positions on drugs. In 
questions for the record, Senator COR-
NYN, the senior Senator from Texas, 
asked Vanita Gupta what research, 
books, studies, and other material did 
you rely on before concluding that ‘‘all 
drugs should be legal’’? 
Gupta said that she has never said 
that all drugs should be legal or com-
pletely decriminalized. 
In his floor speech last week, Senator 
CORNYN claimed 15 times that Gupta 
had lied in response to this question. 
Senator CORNYN held up a poster pur-
portedly showing that Gupta had de-
nied ever making a 2012 statement in 
favor of decriminalizing the simple 
possession of small amounts of drugs. 
The Senator said: If you publish an op- 
ed saying the sky is purple and now 
you say the sky is blue, don’t tell us 
you never thought the sky was purple. 
Senator CORNYN’s claim, I am afraid, 
is false. Vanita Gupta was completely 
honest and forthright. Cornyn’s poster 
left out the very next sentence of 
Gupta’s response, in which she clearly 
acknowledged her past position on de-
criminalizing the simple possession of 
drugs. Gupta stated, and I quote: ‘‘I 
have never advocated for the decrimi-
nalization of all drugs, and I do not 
support the decriminalization of all 
drugs. In 2012, nine years ago, I coau-
thored an article that advocated for 
states to decriminalize and defelonize 
simple possession of all drugs, particu-
larly marijuana, and for small amounts 
of other drugs.’’ 
Does this sound like a person who is 
on a crusade to promote fentanyl, 
opioids, heroin? It sounds like a person 
who might have voted for the FIRST 
STEP Act, signed into law by Presi-
dent Donald Trump, who said we have 
to take an honest look at what arrest 
and imprisonment for simple posses-
sion of drugs has done to America. 
When one out of three Black adult 
males, has, unfortunately, a history of 
incarceration, it raises a question 
about overincarcerating for posses-
sion—possession—of drugs. So I think 
this argument that she cannot be 
trusted on the issue of drugs falls apart 
when you read what she actually said. 
Then 
there 
is 
the 
question 
of 
defunding the police. I don’t know who 
dreamed up that phrase. I don’t think 
much of it. I have never espoused it nor 
argued for it because I think it is so 
misleading, and, in many respects, it 
has been exploited. 
Republicans 
like 
to 
claim 
that 
Vanita 
Gupta 
supports 
efforts 
to 
defund the police. She has never called 
for defunding the police. Suggesting 
she has done so, including an ad by the 
conservative, dark money-funded Judi-
cial 
Crisis 
Network—they 
pop 
up 
around 
here 
whenever 
mysterious 
groups want to spend millions of dol-
lars to discredit someone. These claims 
in that ad are patently false. 
A Washington Post editorial wrote of 
the Judicial Crisis Network claim: 
‘‘Awkwardly, there’s zero proof of that, 
including in the ad’s own footnoted ci-
tation.’’ The Washington Post called 
Judicial Crisis Network’s ad a ‘‘base-
less smear campaign,’’ ‘‘categorically

dishonest,’’ and ‘‘mainly notable for 
the magnitude of lies and distortions it 
crams into 30 seconds.’’ 
And listen to the response and the 
source. The executive director of the 
National Fraternal Order of Police, 
Jim Pasco, called this ad that claimed 
that Gupta wanted to defund the po-
lice—do you know what he called it?— 
‘‘partisan demagoguery.’’ And yet we 
still hear it on the floor of the Senate 
as if it is gospel truth. 
The Fraternal Order of Police sup-
ports Vanita Gupta’s nomination to 
this position in the Department of Jus-
tice, and they aren’t the only ones. 
Virtually every major law enforcement 
group supports Vanita Gupta. You 
wouldn’t know that, would you, when 
you hear on the floor that she wants to 
legalize all drugs and take the money 
away from police. Those simplistic 
statements belie the truth and the fact 
that these organizations support her. 
The Republicans, starting with Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and continuing to this 
moment, will not acknowledge the ob-
vious. These are hard-nosed organiza-
tions that don’t give their endorsement 
out easily, and they weren’t fooled by 
Vanita 
Gupta. 
They 
know 
Vanita 
Gupta. 
In a letter to the Senate endorsing 
Gupta’s nomination, the president of 
the Major County Sheriffs’ Association 
of America—that is a pretty hard- 
nosed group. Here is what they wrote: 
‘‘During our meetings, Ms. Gupta em-
phasized that she does not support ef-
forts to defund the police.’’ They ad-
dressed it directly. They didn’t beat 
around the bush. You don’t expect 
them to; do you? 
During her tenure at the Justice De-
partment, Vanita Gupta worked close-
ly for law enforcement, which is why 
the Senate has received numerous let-
ters of support for her nomination from 
law enforcement groups. I can go 
through the list, and it is long. I won’t. 
Trust me, it has all been entered into 
the RECORD. Every Senator—Democrat 
and Republican—has had a chance to 
see it. 
But I think there is something more 
fundamental to this nomination, which 
we are considering Wednesday, April 
21, in the year 2021. Late yesterday 
afternoon, a verdict in a trial in Min-
nesota captured the attention of Amer-
ica and other places around the world. 
We all know what it was about. It was 
about the death of George Floyd and 
the culpability of a law enforcement 
officer in his death. It was a trial that 
was followed as closely as any trial 
that I can remember, and the verdict 
against the police officer gave some 
people the hope that we are finally 
going to walk down that path again of 
civil rights and be honest about it and 
demand equality under the law for ev-
eryone in this country in the enforce-
ment of law. 
I hope that happens, and I hope that 
we can be a part of it—and we should 
be—in the U.S. Senate. But I will tell 
you, and I can predict with certainty, 
that it is going to be a rocky path for 
those advocates for asserting civil 
rights. History has shown it, and many 
of us have lived it, at least as wit-
nesses, that those who step out and 
speak out for civil rights and human 
rights often pay a heavy price. 
One of the people in our history—our 
recent history—who has done just that 
is Vanita Gupta, the nominee who is 
before us today. 
I mentioned earlier, and I want to 
commend to my colleagues and anyone 
else, this book ‘‘Tulia,’’ written by a 
man named Nate Blakeslee. It is a 
story of a town in Texas. I want to 
briefly describe to you why they would 
write a book about this town in Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at the 
appropriate time, I would ask the Sen-
ator to yield for a brief question. But I 
don’t want to interrupt him in his 
train of thought. 
Mr. DURBIN. Sure. 
Let me read the summary of this 
book and the book cover. I have had a 
chance to read parts of it but not in its 
entirety. Here is what it says: ‘‘Early 
one morning in the summer of 1999, au-
thorities in the tiny West Texas town 
of Tulia began a roundup of suspected 
drug dealers. By the time the sweep 
was done, over 40 people had been ar-
rested and one out of every five black 
adults in town was behind bars, all ac-
cused of dealing cocaine to the same 
undercover officer, Tom Coleman. Cole-
man, the son of a well-known Texas 
Ranger, had been named Officer of the 
Year in Texas. Not until after the 
trials, 
in 
which 
Coleman’s 
uncorroborated testimony secured sen-
tences as long as 361 years, did it be-
come apparent that Coleman was not 
the man he claimed to be. By then, two 
dozen people were imprisoned, and the 
town of Tulia had become a battlefield 
in the national debate over the war on 
drugs.’’ 
And there they sat, dozens of them, 
in prison, accused of serious drug 
crimes. 
And then a young lady graduated 
from law school and went to work in 
the area of civil rights. Six months out 
of law school, she traveled to Tulia, 
TX. Her assignment? Bring justice to 
the 
situation. 
I 
can’t 
imagine, 
6 
months out of law school, barely hav-
ing passed some State’s bar exam, to be 
given that assignment. The woman, of 
course, was Vanita Gupta, and she got 
on a plane from New York. Her civil 
rights organization sent her to Tulia, 
TX, to take on this injustice. 
By then, they were all sitting in jail. 
Most of them were African American. 
And she was sent to Tulia, TX, to res-
cue them and try to help them. 
Well, she quickly assessed the situa-
tion, decided writs of habeas corpus 
would have to be filed to try to get re-
consideration of the charges against 
these individuals, and then she quickly 
realized she was in over her head. She 
couldn’t do this alone. There were too 
many cases. 
So she went back to New York and 
started calling law firms, saying: I 
need your help. I need pro bono attor-
neys, volunteer attorneys who will help 
me do this case. She tackled it and 
took it on, and at the end of the day, 
this brave young woman, whom we are 
about to vote on in an hour and a half, 
was responsible for leading a team that 
liberated these prisoners. 
The Republican Governor of the 
State of Texas officially pardoned 
them for the drug crimes they had been 
charged with, and the State of Texas 
offered damages to them for what they 
had suffered. 
I can’t imagine Vanita Gupta, fresh 
out of law school, heading down to this 
town of Texas and tackling this. How 
about that for your first assignment? 
Most new lawyers are stuck in a li-
brary looking up footnotes and cases. 
She didn’t waste any time but to go 
down there. 
The reason I raise that is, at this mo-
ment today, not even 24 hours after the 
verdict in the trial in Minneapolis, we 
are going to need people just like her 
who have the courage to stand up for 
civil rights, against what seem to be 
insurmountable odds, to bring back 
this Nation of ours—Black and White 
and Brown—together in moving for-
ward. 
I don’t believe she should be discred-
ited, dishonored by what is said on the 
floor of the Senate. She should be 
praised for her courage and determina-
tion. 
She went on to serve in the Depart-
ment of Justice as the head of the Civil 
Rights Division. She took that respon-
sibility, and that is not an easy assign-
ment. Many times, that division is 
called on to deal with police depart-
ments and law enforcement and to tell 
them the bad news that sometimes 
they had done things that are just 
plain wrong and unacceptable. She did 
it. She did it with class, with integrity, 
and the same law enforcement organi-
zations have endorsed her today. 
The Republicans who criticize her 
and they have come to the floor and 
called her a ‘‘radical cultural war-
rior’’—‘‘radical cultural warrior.’’ Re-
cently, she was just called on the floor 
‘‘a clear-and-present danger.’’ I find it 
hard to imagine that anyone could read 
or know of any section of what she did 
in this book and describe her as a ‘‘rad-
ical cultural warrior.’’ 
She brought justice to a situation 
where few people could have done it 
and did it fresh out of law school. She 
is an extraordinary person. She is a 
courageous person. She is a person of 
integrity and honesty and dedication 
to public service. I am happy to sup-
port her nomination. 
I will yield for a question. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question. 
Mr. CORNYN. This is the quote from 
the article that Vanita Gupta wrote on 
November 4, 2012. It says: ‘‘States 
should decriminalize simple possession 
of all drugs, particularly marijuana, 
and for small amounts of other drugs.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2098 
April 21, 2021 
And then in her sworn testimony, in 
response to written questions, she said: 
‘‘I have never advocated for the de-
criminalization of all drugs, and I do 
not support the decriminalization of all 
drugs.’’ 
In 2012, support for the decriminaliza-
tion of all drugs; in 2021, ‘‘I have 
never’’ supported ‘‘the decriminaliza-
tion of all drugs.’’ 
I wonder if my colleague—I just sim-
ply can’t reconcile those two state-
ments, both given under oath to the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Can you reconcile those statements? 
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Senator. 
I will reconcile it in the words of 
Vanita Gupta: ‘‘In 2012, I coauthored an 
article that advocated for states to de-
criminalize and defelonize simple pos-
session of all drugs, particularly mari-
juana, and for small amounts of other 
drugs.’’ 
How much more clarity do you need? 
Now, you and I know that we live by 
our words. And many times, even as 
Senators, people find statements and 
speeches that we have made and come 
back and challenge us. And I would 
just say, her statement is not only 
clear, it is a mainstream statement. To 
argue that this woman is for legalizing 
all drugs, as someone has suggested, is 
ridiculous. She has never said that, and 
she had made it clear what her position 
is, and it is a position which most 
Americans share. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would 
ask the Senator to yield for one last 
question. 
We can all understand how people’s 
views change over time, but there is no 
way to reconcile these two statements, 
2012 and 2021, which is the reason I be-
lieve that Ms. Gupta, for some reason 
lost to me, decided to tell the Senate 
Judiciary Committee two inherently 
conflicting statements under oath. 
She could have gotten out of it the 
easy way and said: ‘‘Well, I made a mis-
take’’ or ‘‘I forgot’’ or ‘‘My views 
changed over time.’’ I would have ac-
cepted that. But to come back on ques-
tions for the record and to state some-
thing that is 180 degrees opposed to her 
views in 2012—I have not heard her, I 
have not heard the distinguished ma-
jority whip, I have not heard anybody 
be able to reconcile those two state-
ments. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I re-
claim my time, if the Senator is fin-
ished. 
So do you believe that the Fraternal 
Order of Police thinks that she wants 
to decriminalize and legalize all drugs? 
Do you think the county sheriffs asso-
ciation believes that? Do you think 
they ever would have endorsed her 
nomination if they believed that for 1 
minute? 
They don’t. I don’t. Her words are 
clear. 
The Senator from New Jersey had a 
question. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate that. I want to acknowledge my 
speaking time was far earlier. I am 
supposed to be presiding right now, but 
I did not want to get between. I am but 
a mouse in the U.S. Senate, as a junior 
person. Those are two elephant titans 
over there. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let me stipulate, Mr. 
President, a pretty large mouse. 
Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate the indul-
gence of the Presiding Officer. I wanted 
to just give general remarks about 
Vanita Gupta, but I would love to 
weigh in and maybe pick up exactly 
where Senator DURBIN left off. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will 
tell you what, let me end my remarks, 
then, and just say to the Senator from 
New Jersey, I am here to listen to him 
as well and to close by saying this ex-
traordinary woman is presenting her 
credentials for approval by the U.S. 
Senate at exactly the right moment in 
history. 
We need, in the Department of Jus-
tice, Vanita Gupta, who has given a 
lifetime of courageous service in the 
pursuit of justice and in the pursuit of 
civil rights. 
Is there a lesson from Minnesota that 
we should bring to the floor of the Sen-
ate? It is the fact that we need people 
like her who can communicate effec-
tively with law enforcement and civil 
rights groups and resolve our dif-
ferences, more at this moment in his-
tory than ever. 
If you can still remember that ver-
dict—and I will remember it for a long, 
long time, as others will—when you 
cast your vote on the Senate floor 
today, vote for Vanita Gupta to be part 
of this Department of Justice team. 
At this moment in American history, 
never have we needed a person with her 
qualifications more than at this mo-
ment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate Senator DURBIN quickly wrapping 
up his remarks and indulging me. I had 
some prepared remarks, but I want to 
break away from them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, thank 
you very much for the recognition. 
I think—I am not sure, but I think I 
am the only Senator here who lives in 
a low-income, Black and Brown com-
munity in the U.S. Senate. I live in a 
beautiful neighborhood in the beautiful 
Central Ward of Newark, NJ. 
We don’t mistake wealth with worth. 
In fact, I went off to get a fancy edu-
cation. I may have gotten my B.A. 
from Stanford, but I got my Ph.D. on 
the streets of Newark, learning from 
some of the most incredible people I 
have ever encountered in my life. 
If there is one lesson that I have 
learned early in my days, in the 1990s, 
living in the Central Ward of Newark 
at the height of the drug war, it is that 
this War on Drugs was not a War on 
Drugs; it was a war on people—and not 
all people but certain people. It was a 
war on poor people. It was a war on 
Black people. 
And it was destroying lives. People 
were getting criminal convictions for 
doing things that two of the last four 
Presidents admitted to doing—simple 
possession, getting criminal convic-
tions for it. 
And here is what is even more an-
guishing at a time in the opioid addic-
tion where everybody now is on the 
same page that people who are addicted 
deserve to have treatment. Back in 
those days, churned into the criminal 
justice system were African Ameri-
cans, for simple possession, who were 
in desperate need of compassion and 
care and love and treatment. 
And this gets me to Vanita Gupta. I 
watched the two statements that my 
friend and colleague from Texas put up, 
there—screaming—the difference be-
tween those two statements: I don’t 
support the legalization of all drugs, 
but I do support the decriminalization 
of small amounts of drugs and getting 
people help and not a lifetime scarlet 
letter of being a convicted criminal. 
She does not support the decrimi-
nalization of all drugs. I am glad to see 
that she is looking at the challenge 
that we have in this country of arrest-
ing people who need help. 
And my friend Senator DURBIN, with 
great patience and not relying on rais-
ing his voice like I do, a real gen-
tleman, said it simply: Vanita Gupta is 
not a partisan. She is a patriot. 
Look at her career. I mean, my mom 
used to tell me: Who you are speaks so 
loudly I can’t hear what you say. In 
other words, judge a person by what 
they have done in their life, how they 
have lived, where they have sacrificed, 
what commitments they have made. 
You chart Vanita’s career, from her 
activism in law school to defend the 
Constitution, from her very first as-
signment as a lawyer in Texas defend-
ing an outrage of injustice—and win-
ning. Where are the people lining up to 
criticize her in those days working in 
her nonprofit work? 
And then, for the great high salaries 
of Department of Justice workers, she 
goes to lead the Civil Rights Division. 
Are there people coming forward from 
their experiences? Are there police offi-
cers, are there police agencies, are 
there police groups coming forward to 
say: When she had that high and 
vaunted position in the Department of 
Justice, did she do something that so 
showed her partisanship? 
Not one. In fact, quite the contrary 
to that, group after group of police or-
ganizations are coming forward and 
saying: She is not a partisan; she is a 
patriot. I stand by her. She is not a 
Democrat or a Republican; she is an 
honest broker, a fair actor who pursues 
justice. 
She has conservatives who are par-
tisans supporting her. I mean, that is 
the thing that gets me. We see partisan 
appointees all the time in here, but 
here is a woman who actually got peo-
ple—Mark Holden from the Koch broth-
ers organization is supporting her. 
So I understand that maybe people 
are taking words and twisting them. 
There is not a Member of this body who

hasn’t had that experience, when the 
intention, the good will, the honesty 
behind the words is distorted and 
twisted by millions of dollars from out-
side organizations that somehow want 
to destroy this woman. 
I know Vanita Gupta. She is not just 
somebody I have a professional rela-
tionship with. I confess to the floor of 
the U.S. Senate, she has been my friend 
for years. I had occasion to talk to her 
dad, not during this time when she was 
nominated—months ago. 
God, the stories he related about her, 
the pride that beamed through the 
telephone about her, about how he 
came from India with $8 in his pocket, 
with an immigrant’s dream, and now 
he gets to see his daughters living lives 
of service, and how his children were 
wired this way, to so appreciate this 
Nation as immigrants, to know that 
this Nation was formed around the 
highest ideals of humanity, and to see 
his two daughters pursuing the cause 
of our country to make this a more 
perfect Union around the ideals of lib-
erty 
and 
justice. 
That 
is 
Vanita 
Gupta’s life. 
I have had private conversations with 
her for years about these issues that 
now she is being accused on. And she is 
not some radical partisan. She has a 
heart and a compassion for human 
beings that, to me, inspires my actions. 
And this is what hurts the most be-
cause somehow I have seen it in our so-
ciety, when a woman stands up and is 
strong and defiantly dedicated to ideals 
that are not made real in reality, they 
are attacked again and again and 
again. I have seen it in my own party 
between Presidential candidates. The 
treatment that the public and the press 
gives one who is the woman is far dif-
ferent than the same standards they 
put to the man. 
And then—God bless America—there 
is something about women of color 
that seems to really get them out-
rageous attacks. I have seen it through 
my culture’s history. They hunted Har-
riet Tubman. They despised Sojourner 
Truth. They belittled Rosa Parks. 
There seems to be something about 
strength, 
something 
about 
talent, 
something about being willing to tell 
the truth that generates something, 
that tries to relegate Black women and 
women of color to be hidden figures in 
history. 
I see it in every element of our coun-
try—even in the medical profession, for 
God’s sake. Even when you control for 
income and education, Black women 
giving birth, their pain is not attended 
to; they are underestimated for the 
struggles they are in; and they die four 
times more often than White women. 
So with this woman I have known for 
years, I have seen her in private and 
public. I have seen her go to work with 
Republicans, join arm in arm with 
them in bettering our country. I have 
seen her serve from her twenties and 
thirties. I have seen her be, in every 
step of her career, committed to our 
country, sacrifice for it. 
Here we stand on the Senate floor. 
And I tell you, on the day after the ver-
dict of George Floyd, where I saw other 
patriots tell the truth on the stand, po-
lice officers break with the waves of 
history, the streams and currents, to 
tell the truth, this is a moment that I 
have to tell the truth. 
This is a good American, a great 
American, honest, committed, who has 
sacrificed for her country. And in a 
time of injustice still, where our jails 
and our prisons are filled with people 
who are hurt, when we, the land of the 
free, have one out of every four incar-
cerated people and, get this, one of out 
of every three incarcerated women on 
the planet Earth in our jails and pris-
ons—where almost 90 percent of them 
are survivors of sexual assault—this is 
the time we need more compassion; 
this is the time we need more empathy; 
this is the time we need more civic 
grace toward one another. 
And 
Vanita 
embodies 
that. 
She 
stands for that in every fiber of her 
being. Her career echoes with that spir-
it. Should we confirm her to this posi-
tion, I promise you here on the Senate 
floor before the flag of my country, she 
will do this Nation proud, committed. 
She will never mistake popularity for 
that purpose. She will never be dis-
tracted by the partisan games going on 
in the Capitol. She will be committed 
to the higher calling. 
I ask my colleagues to step back for 
a moment and see the truth of who she 
is, who police organizations say she is, 
who prominent conservatives say she 
is, to see the person her dad says she is 
and elevate this incredible person, this 
incredible woman of color, to a posi-
tion that desperately—to a nation that 
desperately needs this kind of leader. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
didn’t come to the floor to speak to the 
nominee who is before us this after-
noon, but following the very impas-
sioned comments by my colleagues, in 
fairness, on both sides of the aisle and 
recognizing the vote that I just took 
about an hour ago to advance Vanita 
Gupta to this position, I will take just 
a moment to explain where I am com-
ing from and why I will be supporting 
her final confirmation in just an hour. 
I have looked at her record. I have 
had an extensive sitdown with her. I 
am impressed with not only her profes-
sional credentials but really the level 
of experience, but more to the com-
ments that we just heard on the floor, 
the passion that she carries with her in 
the work that she performs. 
I think it is fair to say we will all 
agree her confirmation has been very 
challenged. She has had significant 
back-and-forth in committee. She has 
been elevated with very strong rhetor-
ical words in favor and, equally, words 
of condemnation. 
I asked her point blank: Why do you 
want this? Is this worth it? Because 
this has been, clearly, very hard on her 
as a nominee. She paused and reflected 
a moment and just spoke to how she 
feels called to serve in a very personal 
way that I thought was impactful. 
We had a long discussion about some 
of the issues that I care deeply about in 
my State as they relate to justice, ac-
cess to justice, public safety, and the 
real tragedy that we face when it 
comes to women, primarily our Native 
women, who experience rates of domes-
tic violence and sexual assault that are 
shocking, disturbing, and wrong. De-
spite all that we have as a State, the 
resources we have, the opportunities 
we have, we have not been able to turn 
the corner as we have needed to in con-
fronting what I believe is a true 
scourge. 
It is going to take more than re-
sources. Jurisdictionally, it is very 
complicated in Alaska. We don’t have 
reservations. We don’t have similar law 
enforcement presence in many parts of 
the State that you might have in the 
lower 48. 
We have a great deal of work to do as 
a State. But as we discussed these 
issues, I felt that I was speaking to a 
woman who had not only committed a 
professional life to try to get to the 
base of these injustices, to try to not 
just direct a little bit of money, put a 
program in place, walk away, and call 
it a day, but to truly try to make a dif-
ference. 
So there are some statements that 
she has made in some other areas that, 
in fairness, I find troubling and con-
cerning, and part of my job will be to 
ensure that she understands clearly 
how this translates into issues in my 
State and with our particular issues. 
But I am going to give the benefit of 
the doubt to a woman who I believe has 
demonstrated through her professional 
career to be deeply, deeply committed 
to matters of justice. So I will be cast-
ing my vote in support of her in about 
an hour here. 
SEMI ACT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
came to the floor today to talk about 
something that has been top of my 
mind for a period of time, and I wanted 
to bring it to Members’ attention 
today because of some recent articles 
of late as it relates to national security 
and global competitiveness, particu-
larly as they relate to domestic re-
source development. 
In recent months, since the begin-
ning of this administration, I have spo-
ken out in concern at the direction 
that I have seen the new administra-
tion take with regard to energy secu-
rity and how that relates to Alaska. I 
have spoken out at length about my 
opposition to several of these Execu-
tive orders that were very early on re-
lating to leasing and permitting mora-
toria in my State. In fact, there were 
eight specific orders that were directed 
to one State and to one State only. 
That is a pretty hard hit for Alaska. 
In other areas, I don’t believe that 
additional Federal lands and waters in 
Alaska should be placed off-limits. We

already as a State hold more public 
lands than any other State, and by con-
siderable degree. I don’t believe our 
public land order removal process 
should be paused. 
This was an announcement that just 
came out of the Department of the In-
terior last week. They say they are 
pausing it, but effectively, it could be 
delayed or abandoned not just for these 
next 2 years going forward but perma-
nently. What this effectively does is it 
creates almost de facto wilderness, if 
you will, because you have placed land 
in a limbo, in a purgatory for decades. 
Nobody can do anything with it as 
these PLOs, these public land orders 
remain in place. 
I note—no great secret around here— 
like most Alaskans, I strongly support 
our resource development industry and 
the men and the women who work 
within it. They are my friends. They 
are my neighbors. I fish with them. I 
recognize the importance and the value 
of what they do. I have worked hard 
here in the Senate and for a long time 
to ensure that the industry’s continued 
centrality is allowed to prosper, not 
only because of them, the people I 
know, but because of what it means for 
our country, for our economy, our 
State’s budget, our prosperity, and also 
for our environment. 
After years of lagging behind, the 
United States has come to a better 
place on energy in recent years. We 
have seen domestic production rising. 
We have seen our emissions falling. We 
have created jobs. We have generated 
revenues. We have changed the world 
geopolitically even as we have lessened 
our impact on the climate. But these 
kinds of gains can’t be taken for grant-
ed. They can’t be actively ignored. 
They certainly should not be discarded. 
We have to acknowledge that this en-
ergy renewal has not been even across 
the country. It has taken place largely 
on State and private lands. We have 
very limited private land in Alaska. 
And instate activity—we have been 
proudly producing for a while. But we 
also have, again, much land that is fed-
erally held, and we have only seen help 
arrive with any kind of activity and 
production on Federal land in the past 
few years. I would suggest that we can-
not afford that forward progress to be 
reversed, but unfortunately that is the 
way it feels right now. The threat is 
that this administration is going to 
take an approach that is going to take 
us backwards. 
So the question, I think, is a fair one 
for us to ask, to discuss here. It is an 
important question. What happens if 
we just decide we are going to turn our 
backs on this, our American energy? 
What happens if we really do move in 
this direction of just keeping it in the 
ground? What happens if we really do 
close our eyes to our domestic energy 
sources, these assets, if we close our 
eyes to the contributions that they 
provide? 
I will suggest to you that there are a 
few warning signs that we have up on 
the horizon. Oil prices are back up 
above $60 a barrel. This actually helps 
my State; I will be honest there. We 
will accept that for budgetary pur-
poses. But we all talk about what hap-
pens typically around Memorial Day. 
We have driving season coming on. We 
are still in the midst of a pandemic. 
But if the United States artificially re-
stricts its supplies and demand re-
bounds rapidly, where does this put us? 
I mentioned that there have been 
some articles of late that just really 
kind of struck me. It is interesting be-
cause I thought they were pretty sig-
nificant, but it seems they are rel-
atively unnoticed here in Washington. 
According to Bloomberg, Russia has 
now supplanted Saudi Arabia to be-
come the third largest supplier of crude 
oil in the United States. Canada is our 
No. 1. But there has been a series of 
circumstances. As our domestic pro-
duction is falling, the Saudis have also 
reduced theirs, and it has been Ven-
ezuela. Venezuela is subject to sanc-
tions. Their production has pretty 
much gone offline to the United States. 
Part of what we are seeing, though, is 
the refusal on the Federal Govern-
ment’s side to approve cross-border 
pipeline infrastructure. Canada, again, 
is our largest—we import more from 
Canada than anywhere else, and they 
have greater capacity to help us out 
here so that we don’t have to take it 
from Russia. But, instead, we haven’t 
been able to take more from Canada to 
fill in that gap because of pipeline ca-
pacity. So what happens is, we are 
sending more of our money to Russia 
at a time when we are not on very good 
terms with Russia. Need we say elec-
tions? Need we say SolarWinds? Need 
we say what we are seeing from Putin? 
This is what is happening: We are 
sending more of our dollars to Russia, 
and they are sending us more of the re-
sources that we could produce here at 
home or perhaps at least import them 
from some friendlier nations. 
U.S. crude oil production fell from an 
average high of 12.2 million barrels per 
day in 2019 to an average of 11.3 million 
in 2020. According to the Energy Infor-
mation Administration, this loss in do-
mestic 
production 
will 
return 
the 
United States to being a net petroleum 
importer in 2021 and 2022. By all ac-
counts, a sizable chunk of this will 
come from Russia. 
What is going to happen is, we are 
going to move from this position where 
we have been in these past few years 
where we have had some real energy se-
curity here because we have been pro-
ducing, and we have been producing to 
the point that we have been able to 
even supply to our friends and allies. 
But now, with policies that are taking 
us in a different direction and still 
knowing that we need the resource, we 
are turning to Russia. 
This is what really galls me so much: 
In 2020, the United States imported 
538,000 barrels of oil per day from Rus-
sia. In Alaska—we recognize Alaska is 
a great producing State. Despite our 
immense potential and desire to bring 
it to market, in 2020, we were pro-
ducing an average of 448,000 barrels per 
day. 
It just begs the question: Is this what 
we really want? Is this what we really 
want, for Russia to account for more of 
America’s energy supply than Alaska? 
We both have similar environments, 
both big, but oil production goes on in 
areas that are tough to produce in. I 
will 
hold 
Alaska’s 
environmental 
record over that of Russia any day—in 
fact, over most countries and even 
most States any day. 
One article put it this way. They 
said: ‘‘America’s increasing reliance on 
Russian oil is at odds with U.S. energy 
diplomacy.’’ 
Let’s kind of put it in context. The 
position that we have taken with Nord 
Stream 2—basically what we have said 
is that we are asking those in Europe 
who need Russia’s gas—we are saying 
we need to be tough on this. We need to 
break Russia’s hold here. For all the 
years—it has been 7 years since Russia 
annexed Crimea and demonstrated to 
the world that they are not afraid to 
flex their muscles when it comes to en-
ergy exports in order to achieve their 
geopolitical goals. 
So we have been saying on Nord 
Stream 2: Europe, you guys, don’t go 
there. Yet we have to look at ourselves 
here because we are telling Europe 
‘‘Limit your reliance on Russia for 
gas,’’ but over here, we are happy to 
step up our imports from Russia on oil. 
The President has just recently im-
posed tougher sanctions on Russia, as 
he absolutely should, but I think we 
need to be eyes wide open here, folks, 
in terms of what it means when we 
need that resource. 
I do recognize that much of this dis-
cussion on Russia and how Russia has 
supplemented Venezuelan crude—I rec-
ognize that most of the oil that is 
being imported is heavy and that this 
is a situation with our gulf coast refin-
eries that are specifically geared for 
that. I do recognize that they have 
fewer options right now, but I do think 
this is a conversation that we need to 
be talking about. We just can’t sit back 
and say: Well, this is just the way it is. 
Congress 
and 
the 
administration 
need to be taking the steps necessary 
to ensure that we in this country have 
a strong, stable supply of domestic en-
ergy to meet our current demand, our 
future demand, and, to the greatest ex-
tent possible, the demand from our al-
lies. 
Russia is positioning itself to cap-
italize on all of that. They produce 
from wherever they want, and they are 
going to sell to wherever they can. 
The least that we can do here at 
home is to support our own responsible 
production from States like Alaska, so 
that we have our supply—our own sup-
ply—and can provide a diversified com-
mercial alternative. 
Moving from oil and gas briefly here, 
Alaska is also ready to help in another 
increasingly crucial area and that is

with mineral development. Our history 
of tectonic events has created a geo-
logical environment that fosters depos-
its of a wide variety of minerals that 
are critical to both our current and our 
future economies. 
Back in 2018, the Department of the 
Interior designated 35 ‘‘critical’’ min-
erals based on their importance to our 
economy and security, as well as their 
susceptibility to supply and disruption. 
These minerals are essential for every-
thing. They help us with our advanced 
missile systems, solar panels, batteries 
for electric vehicles, your cell phones— 
everything. Our military is certainly 
aware of this. They recognize the vul-
nerable position that we are in. Our 
manufacturers recognize the vulnera-
bility. These are products that we use 
on a daily basis. 
Right now, the United States is im-
port-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals 
designated as ‘‘critical.’’ We have rel-
atively no domestic production. We 
rely completely on imports to meet our 
demand for 14 of these. And, of course, 
most of where we are importing these 
materials are from China. That is not 
OK. That shouldn’t be acceptable to us. 
I think we all should agree on the need 
to rebuild our domestic mineral supply 
chains. There has been good, positive 
conversation about what we can do. 
I feel this is one of those areas that 
is a growing vulnerability. It used to be 
that we would talk about our vulnera-
bility on the Middle East for our oil, 
and then policies changed and we re-
duced our reliance on that. That is why 
I am anxious. I am concerned about 
what I am seeing translate going for-
ward. But I think we need to be, again, 
with eyes wide open when it comes to 
our mineral dependence and our reli-
ance on these important materials for 
what we need to be a strong nation. 
I think this is a pressing and long- 
term security threat that we face in 
this country. We have seen it play out 
in light of the COVID pandemic. We 
have seen the vulnerability of inter-
national supply chains. I thought it 
was great. It was so important that the 
administration really focused in on 
this. The new administration is focus-
ing on this in a good way, and I appre-
ciate that. 
When President Biden released the 
first part of his infrastructure pro-
posal, focusing on international domes-
tic supply chains, he has one section 
there about electric vehicles. In the 
White House fact sheet, it says the 
plan ‘‘will enable automakers to spur 
domestic supply chains from raw mate-
rials to parts, retool factories to com-
pete globally, and support American 
workers to make batteries and EVs.’’ 
This is the type of policy that we 
should all want to get behind, broad-
ened out to every industry, not just to 
a select few. But the question here, 
though, is whether the administration 
is willing to accept what is going to be 
necessary in order to achieve this goal 
to have these secure supply chains, es-
pecially when it comes to expanding 
our domestic supply of raw materials. 
It is going to require approval of min-
ing projects, and that has been a chal-
lenge for us. That has been a challenge 
for us. 
This is where I go to another article 
that came up a few weeks back. This is 
from Reuters. It appears to me that 
rather than looking within our own 
borders, the administration is looking 
beyond. In this article from Reuters, it 
states that the United States looks to 
Canada for minerals to build electric 
vehicles. It provides: 
The U.S. Government is working to help 
American miners and battery makers expand 
into Canada, part of a strategy to boost re-
gional production of minerals used to make 
electric vehicles and counter Chinese com-
petitors. 
It goes on further to talk about the 
different ways that the Department of 
Commerce is discussing with many how 
we can boost Canadian production of 
EV materials. It goes on further to say: 
But Washington is increasingly viewing 
Canada as a kind of ‘‘51st State’’ for mineral 
supply purposes. 
I am a big fan of Canada. They are 
our neighbor, but if we are going to be 
adding Canada as a 51st State to help 
us with our minerals and access to 
minerals, let’s not forget the 49th 
State, because Alaska has good, strong 
resources. Where we seem to have prob-
lems is in gaining access, whether it is 
in the permitting process or just the 
ability to move forward with some of 
our mineral potential. 
Again, I am not suggesting that we 
shouldn’t be looking to our friends to 
build these alliances, particularly with 
our neighbors directly to the north and 
to the south. This is good. I am not 
suggesting: Let’s not be talking to 
Canada. 
That is an important part of how we 
really work to build these secure sup-
ply chains. All I am suggesting is that 
we here in America need to also look to 
the strength of our resource assets. 
There are some—again, the issue of 
mining in this country sometimes can 
be a controversial one. I am going to 
suggest to folks that if we really want 
to do more to build out not only our 
national security but if we want to 
build out our clean, diverse energy in-
frastructure, moving toward the Presi-
dent’s vision of greater renewable op-
portunities, which I want to do, let’s 
acknowledge that we are going to need 
these minerals. We don’t really have a 
choice here. 
The World Bank recently released a 
report looking at ‘‘The Mineral Inten-
sity of the Clean Energy Transition.’’ 
They found that ‘‘large relative in-
creases in demand of up to nearly 500 
percent are estimated for certain min-
erals, especially those concentrated in 
energy storage technologies, such as 
lithium, graphite, and cobalt.’’ The re-
port also found that ‘‘even with large 
increases in recycling—including sce-
narios where 100 percent end of life re-
cycling is achieved—there is still like-
ly to be strong demand for primary 
minerals.’’ 
We know we are going to need it. 
People like Elon Musk last year said: 
‘‘Please mine more nickel.’’ He prom-
ised: ‘‘Tesla will give you a giant con-
tract for a long period of time if you 
mine nickel efficiently and in an envi-
ronmentally sensitive way.’’ 
I am with you on that. 
Look at the analysis from Goldman 
Sachs, which found that increasing de-
mand for electric car batteries is caus-
ing automakers to brace for a surge in 
prices in lithium, cobalt, and nickel. 
In order for us to get there from here, 
in order to achieve a transition to re-
newable and cleaner technologies, we 
have to acknowledge that there is 
going to be a mineral footprint. It will 
be impossible to establish a robust do-
mestic supply chain for EVs and bat-
teries if we continue to import the raw 
materials from other nations, includ-
ing some that continue to dramatically 
outcompete us in these areas every 
year. 
I think we need a rational, clear- 
headed, eyes-wide-open approach to en-
ergy and mineral development. We 
don’t want to go backward on energy, 
and we can’t be caught flatfooted on 
minerals. We have the resources. We 
have the highest labor standards in the 
world and the highest environmental 
standards in the world. Our energy 
workers and our miners will hold them-
selves to those standards. Instead of 
importing more from places like Rus-
sia and China, we need to free ourselves 
from them to the extent that we can 
establish ourselves as this global alter-
native. 
I have kind of taken that—actually, 
it is not something new. In the begin-
ning of the 116th Congress, I prepared a 
white paper. We called it ‘‘The Amer-
ican and Global’’—well, what we called 
it was a pretty cool title. It is a great 
little publication that should have got-
ten more notice, but like a good wine, 
it comes with time: ‘‘’With Powers So 
Disposed,’ America and the Global 
Strategic Energy Competition.’’ 
I outline in this a strategic energy 
initiative designed to sharpen and di-
rect our tools of energy related to eco-
nomic statecraft and to enhance the 
geopolitical position of the country. 
From that or as a jump-off from that, 
I am introducing my Strategic Energy 
and Minerals Initiative Act, which we 
call the SEMI Act. This legislation will 
enable U.S. companies to better com-
pete in global markets, and it promotes 
the responsible domestic production of 
our oil, gas, and minerals. I think these 
are initiatives that are good for us to 
be looking critically at, again, as we 
move forward with this administra-
tion’s priorities on not only how we 
can build infrastructure—build it bet-
ter, build it cleaner, build it with a re-
newable future—but we have to recog-
nize that when we build things, we 
need base elements. 
Know that Alaska is ready, willing, 
and able to play a role on all of these 
fronts. We have tremendous stores of

resources, but equal to those tremen-
dous stores of resources is the responsi-
bility that I believe Alaskans feel to be 
good stewards as we access those re-
sources to allow for a level of sustain-
ability, whether it is with our fisheries 
or whether it is with the subsistence, 
the livelihoods of those who rely on the 
food and animals on the land. We be-
lieve that we can contribute to our na-
tional security and our global competi-
tiveness, while at the same time work-
ing to protect the environment, but 
what we need is a chance to be able to 
do that. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Senator from Iowa. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, when you 
hear the word ‘‘infrastructure,’’ what 
comes to mind? For folks across Iowa, 
it is roads; it is bridges, locks and 
dams, 
ports, 
waterways, 
and 
broadband. But according to the Biden 
administration, infrastructure is now a 
buzzword that encompasses just about 
every item on the progressive wish list. 
As a result, the President’s infrastruc-
ture proposal takes a very sharp left 
turn by including everything from ele-
ments of the socialist Green New Deal 
to higher taxes on American workers. 
Some of my Democratic colleagues 
are even urging the President to in-
clude a pathway to citizenship for mil-
lions of undocumented immigrants in 
the infrastructure package. 
How about we make the wall on our 
southern border infrastructure? 
Probably to no one’s surprise, once 
again, the Senate majority leader is 
plotting to pass the bill in a totally 
partisan process. 
Folks, we really need to pump the 
brakes. The Democrats are steering us 
the wrong way on this issue. Infra-
structure is an issue that has always 
enjoyed broad bipartisan support in 
Congress. 
We may disagree on how much to 
spend or how to pay for the costs, but 
we all agree that maintaining and im-
proving our roads, bridges, ports, and 
waterways is one of the most impor-
tant roles of the Federal Government’s. 
There is no reason to drive us apart on 
such an important issue that typically 
brings us together and impacts all of 
our States. 
But President Biden is on a one-way 
street to more gridlock. Only about 5 
to 6 percent of the $2.2 trillion of the 
Biden proposal is dedicated to roads 
and bridges. The Biden plan spends less 
fixing potholes and repairing roads 
than it does on promoting electric ve-
hicles and perks for the coastal elites 
who drive them, and you had better be-
lieve that this could have a devastating 
impact on Iowa’s ethanol and biodiesel 
industries, which support our States’ 
local 
economies. 
Even 
the 
liberal 
Washington Post is taking issue with 
the Democratic administration’s claim 
that 19 million jobs will be created by 
the proposal. The real number is less 
than 3 million. Each job created by this 
so-called American Jobs Act will cost 
our taxpayers $865,000, and because 
American workers will bear the brunt 
of the higher taxes in the Biden plan, 
that will mean lower wages. These 
costs are sure to give taxpayers road 
rage. 
There is no reason to take this rad-
ical left turn. Last Congress, the 
Democrats and the Republicans on the 
Senate’s 
Environment 
and 
Public 
Works Committee, which I serve on, 
worked together to unanimously pass 
out of committee an important infra-
structure bill to help fix our roadways. 
This highway bill provides us with a 
great starting point to move us for-
ward in the right direction—toward a 
bipartisan infrastructure plan. This 5- 
year, $287 billion bill was the largest 
highway bill in history, and it was sup-
ported by Senators from across the po-
litical 
spectrum 
who 
represented 
States from Vermont and New York to 
Alabama, Mississippi, and, of course, 
Iowa. 
In hailing from a very rural part of 
Iowa, I am all for looking at ways to 
invest in broadband expansion, to sup-
port our roadways, and to make sure 
we have the right infrastructure in 
place to combat flooding in my home 
State. Those are true infrastructure 
needs and are the ones that I believe 
would get strong bipartisan support in 
a 50–50 Senate, but by throwing in pro-
gressive policy wish list items and non-
infrastructure-related provisions, the 
Biden plan is headed down a dead-end 
street. 
The President needs to do a U-turn 
and start working with the Repub-
licans on a bipartisan roadmap for 
America. By putting aside the partisan 
pet projects—projects like the Hono-
lulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor 
Project—and picking up where we left 
off, with the unanimously bipartisan 
highway bill, we can steer the infra-
structure bill into the passing lane 
under the Senate’s regular order. 
So, folks, let’s come together and lit-
erally start building some bipartisan 
bridges. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
talk also about infrastructure and as-
sociate myself with the interest that 
the country has in infrastructure. 
In fact, one of the things that the 
government has done the longest has 
been roads and bridges and canals. I 
think, initially, the term ‘‘internal im-
provements’’ was, in the early 19th cen-
tury, what they would have talked 
about when they talked about what we 
began to talk about later as ‘‘infra-
structure.’’ During almost the entire 
history of the country, there was an 
understanding 
of 
what 
‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ meant in America. 
Infrastructure is pretty popular, and 
infrastructure is definitely something 
that you generally can’t do for your-
self. You can’t, on your own, provide 
the waterline that connects your house 
to the next house. On your own, you 
can’t provide the road that gets you 
from home to work. On your own, you 
can’t do a lot of things that we did 
early on and up until right now and 
call them infrastructure. Normally, 
they were seen as things like roads and 
bridges and dams—big projects that 
sometimes crossed State lines—or big 
projects that sometimes were just too 
big for a State or a town to handle, 
like water systems that needed to be 
improved. 
When we did that—and I will talk 
later about the way we did that—the 
bipartisan agreement also largely led 
to figuring out ways that infrastruc-
ture would pay for itself, in that the 
people who used the infrastructure 
would pay for the infrastructure, and 
we looked at that in a number of dif-
ferent ways. 
Now, in the package that the admin-
istration has proposed, the $2.3 trillion 
package, there are lots of things in 
there that I don’t disagree that the 
Senate should debate or I don’t even 
rule out of hand that the country 
might want to do. Yet I think they are 
not infrastructure, and the funding 
way to get to them makes it harder to 
have the kind of bipartisan agreement 
that, I think, we could have in an in-
frastructure bill. The Republicans are 
for it, and the Democrats are for it in 
the House, in the Senate. Let’s talk 
about how to get there. 
Let’s also make the point, of the $213 
billion in this plan that is for Green 
New Deal building makeovers, there 
may be a place to do that, and it is 
something that we could clearly de-
bate, but it is not the same thing as in-
frastructure. I was, at one time, the 
chairman of the Missouri Housing De-
velopment Commission. We did a lot of 
things to make it possible for people to 
have houses or for people to have build-
ings that they could have an oppor-
tunity to be a part of, but we never 
really called it infrastructure, and we 
did it in a different way. 
On surface transportation, generally, 
for decades, that was paid by the high-
way trust fund. How did you fund the 
highway trust fund? You funded the 
highway trust fund by people pulling 
up to service stations and putting fuel 
in their cars, and when they did that, 
they paid into the highway trust fund. 
The more miles you drove, the more 
you paid into the highway trust fund, 
and Americans thought that was fair. 
We haven’t raised the highway gas tax 
since 1993, and that could very well be 
a debate we should have as part of an 
infrastructure package. If not the gas 
tax, what other kind of user fee could 
there be? Lots of people use the high-
ways, the roads, the bridges, and the 
Interstate Highway System who don’t 
pay a gas tax now because they are 
transitioning to vehicles like electric 
vehicles that don’t fill up at that gas 
pump. 
That is a debate I think we should 
have as part of an infrastructure de-
bate. Just last year, it was predicted

that the highway trust fund would run 
out of money before the year was over, 
and it did. Because we collect less 
money every year than we spend every 
year, we decided to subsidize that out 
of general revenue, but nobody in that 
debate ever thought that it should be 
the permanent solution. 
For other kinds of projects, we look 
for ways to help the end user make a 
project possible both in urban commu-
nities and rural communities. There 
are programs in which you can replace 
your water system or your stormwater 
system with something that works and 
price it appropriately. What we have 
done there is say: Well, we are going to 
figure out how we can either guarantee 
your bonds or write down your loans or 
both so that the users in those systems 
over, maybe, 30 years would pay back 
in amounts they could afford—what 
happened when you turned the lead 
water pipe into an appropriate water 
pipe. I am in favor of replacing every 
lead water pipe in America, but I think 
you can do that in a way that the users 
of those systems pay for those systems 
just like all of their neighbors in neigh-
boring communities are paying for 
their systems. We could help them do 
that, and we have proven we can help 
them do that. 
We could also create an infrastruc-
ture bank. Senator WARNER and I have 
worked on that for years. I think we 
are going to reintroduce the REPAIR 
Act, which would really be a non-
partisan financing authority whereby 
the government guarantees a certain 
amount of that money, and maybe gov-
ernment assistance in putting together 
a public-private partnership creates an-
other way that a little bit of Federal 
money creates a lot more infrastruc-
ture activity. 
You could look at these and other 
issues like asset recycling, where the 
government leases or sells some exist-
ing public infrastructure and uses the 
proceeds of that to fund new projects. 
In Australia, they used that system to 
help pay for an expansion of subway 
systems and other things. In fact, the 
Federal Government would encourage 
local governments to privatize one of 
their local government assets that had 
customers. Then they would take that 
money, maybe, and build sidewalks 
that don’t have customers, and the 
water systems that would have cus-
tomers would have helped to build the 
sidewalks as it would be managed by a 
private company, but all of those pri-
vate companies would be regulated in a 
way that people who would be cus-
tomers would know they were pro-
tected. 
We have had a lot of bipartisan infra-
structure bills over the last decades 
and more than decades. Infrastructure 
bills are not new to America. Figuring 
out how you have an infrastructure bill 
that meets the definition of ‘‘infra-
structure’’ and a system where the in-
frastructure goes as far as it possibly 
can to pay for itself by those people 
who use it has always involved Repub-
licans and Democrats reaching an 
agreement. I don’t know that there has 
ever been a partisan infrastructure bill. 
It has always involved reaching agree-
ment on what would be in the bill and 
reaching agreement on finding ways to 
pay for it. 
New definitions can really confuse 
ideas that the American people think 
they understand. People are for infra-
structure. They think that it is some-
thing the government should do. They 
can pass a test on what they believe 
‘‘infrastructure’’ means if they have 
ever watched an infrastructure debate 
before. Let’s find a way that we can 
move forward in a bipartisan way with 
an infrastructure bill that meets the 
standards of infrastructure and meets 
the standards of doing everything we 
can to be sure the system is fairly paid 
for by the people who use it and can af-
ford to pay for it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mrs. LUMMIS. Madam President, I 
rise to echo and augment the remarks 
of the gentleman from Missouri and to 
call on President Biden and the Demo-
crats in Congress to work with the Re-
publicans on a bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill. As the only Senator in the 
unique position of sitting on all three 
committees 
with 
jurisdiction 
over 
transportation, I have a particular in-
terest in making sure we are ade-
quately funding our roads and bridges. 
I have had many conversations with 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
since I have joined the Senate, and ev-
eryone agrees that we have real infra-
structure 
and 
transportation 
needs 
that must be addressed. The American 
Society of Civil Engineers recently 
gave our roads a D-minus rating, not-
ing our $786 billion backlog on roads’ 
and bridges’ capital needs. They gave 
our bridges a C-minus rating and a re-
pair tag of $125 billion. 
We also need to take another look at 
how we fund our highway system. 
Right now, we have a highway trust 
fund that we can’t actually trust. 
Since 2008, we have been relying on 
general fund transfers to pay for our 
roads and bridges instead of fixing our 
user fee model to keep the trust fund 
solvent. User fees give users the benefit 
of seeing where their money is going, 
and they allow those people deriving 
the most benefit from the system to 
give the most in support. This is a very 
fair, American way of doing things, and 
the certainty we get from a func-
tioning user fee model is important for 
rural States, like my home State of 
Wyoming. 
While much divides Congress these 
days, infrastructure, as that term is 
understood by most Americans, is a bi-
partisan issue. As such, one would as-
sume that President Biden would want 
to find some common ground in order 
to build relationships in Congress and 
address the needs of every citizen. So it 
is perplexing that President Biden, who 
campaigned on bringing our Nation to-
gether, is now pushing a blatantly par-
tisan infrastructure bill. 
Let me show you why partisanship is 
unnecessary 
in 
the 
infrastructure 
space. I recently helped my Democratic 
colleagues on the Environment and 
Public Works Committee pass a bipar-
tisan water and wastewater infrastruc-
ture bill out of committee with unani-
mous support. This is clear evidence 
that Democrats and Republicans can 
come together on infrastructure issues 
and find common ground. In 2019, the 
EPW Committee, under the leadership 
of my fellow Senator from Wyoming, 
JOHN BARRASSO, unanimously passed a 
bipartisan 5-year highway funding bill. 
This would be a great place to start for 
any infrastructure bill in Congress. 
But this barely scratches the surface 
of bipartisan infrastructure legislation. 
Honestly, I am hard-pressed to remem-
ber a time when infrastructure was not 
bipartisan. The American Water Infra-
structure Act of 2018? Bipartisan. The 
Water Infrastructure Improvements for 
the Nation Act of 2016? Bipartisan. The 
Highway Transportation Funding Act 
of 2015? Bipartisan. The Fixing Amer-
ica’s Surface Transportation Act of 
2015? Bipartisan. The Water Resources 
Development Act of 2014? Bipartisan. 
This isn’t even a full decade of congres-
sional action, and all of these things 
happened in partisan environments, 
when Americans were divided on a host 
of issues. But despite our divisions, we 
have always come together to address 
American infrastructure. In 2021, this 
should be no different. 
If President Biden wants to truly 
unite the Nation, he can start by work-
ing with Republicans on the most basic 
bipartisan issues, and he might be sur-
prised which Members of Congress are 
there to join him. 
I will use myself as an example. I 
have 
opposed 
many 
of 
President 
Biden’s actions to date, but I support 
his decision to bring our troops home 
from Afghanistan, and I am doing so 
publicly. I have also supported several 
of President Biden’s nominees, includ-
ing Secretary Buttigieg. 
I can promise President Biden that if 
he comes in good faith to work with 
Republicans and Democrats on a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, I will be there 
to work with him every step of the 
way. I know my colleagues feel the 
same. All we are asking is for the 
‘‘unity’’ President to come to the

Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
am pleased to have joined my Repub-
lican colleagues on the floor today. I 
associate myself with all of their com-
ments, especially the speech just deliv-
ered by my friend from Wyoming, and 
demonstrate my strong support for a 
significant investment in America’s in-
frastructure. 
You know, as my colleagues have 
said, infrastructure has been one of the 
most bipartisan policy areas in Con-
gress over the decades, and rightfully

so. I mean, we are obligated to provide 
for the national infrastructure. 
As the lead Republican on the EPW 
Subcommittee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, I am committed to 
doing my part. I am confident we can 
accomplish this on a national level and 
in a strong bipartisan fashion. 
As has been said, 2 years ago, under 
the leadership of Chairman BARRASSO, 
EPW unanimously passed America’s 
Transportation Infrastructure Act. It 
was the most substantial highway bill 
yet in our history. It authorized hun-
dreds of billions of Federal dollars to 
maintain and repair America’s roads 
and bridges, and it made reasonable 
regulatory 
changes—very 
important 
regulatory changes—so that projects 
wouldn’t get derailed by endless bu-
reaucracy. 
It also maintained the current for-
mula for deciding how States will re-
ceive the Federal funds. This funding 
formula ensures that States with small 
populations but expansive road sys-
tems, like North Dakota and Wyoming 
and Oklahoma, receive sufficient re-
sources to update their roads and 
bridges within their borders. It is 
States like ours that feed and fuel the 
country. So not only does the tradi-
tional funding formula protect the in-
terests of rural America, it protects all 
of America. 
The movement of goods and services 
in support of our economy and the con-
sumers cannot reserve a few thousand 
miles here and there of interstate for 
gravel. Interstate commerce requires a 
transportation system that is safe and 
sufficient for every mile. The pavement 
can’t end in Minneapolis and get 
picked up in Seattle. For food to get to 
your table requires thousands of miles 
of safe, reliable roads, bridges, rails, 
and waterways. 
My State of North Dakota is literally 
the center of the North American con-
tinent and is a top producer of dozens 
of crops and other food items. For ex-
ample, we are the very top producer— 
by a long ways, by the way—of durum. 
Durum is the wheat that is ground into 
semolina flour, which is the main in-
gredient in pasta. So if you love cook-
ing spaghetti in your kitchen or order-
ing penne at your favorite restaurant, 
you have to get the durum off the field 
in North Dakota to the elevator, where 
a train or a truck will pick it up and 
take it to the mill, where it will be 
ground into semolina before getting on 
another truck or train to the pasta 
plant, then to the grocery warehouse in 
another State, where it catches a ride 
to a distribution company or a retailer 
before it gets put into a pot of boiling 
water on its way to your plate in your 
Manhattan apartment or your favorite 
Los Angeles restaurant. 
That is why we included the formula 
in the last highway bill when I was in 
the House. It is why we kept it in the 
highway bill at the committee level 
last Congress. And there is every good 
reason why we ought to include it now. 
Under the leadership of Chairman 
CARPER and Ranking Member CAPITO, 
EPW has had two hearings reiterating 
the importance of investing in America 
and dealing with the solvency of the 
highway trust fund. 
It was disheartening to read a news 
story earlier this week and see how 
many of my colleagues are urging the 
President to not work with Repub-
licans and to go it alone on infrastruc-
ture. One even said he was worried that 
Republicans would ‘‘never show up.’’ 
Well, here we are. We have shown up. 
Like I told Chairman CARPER just 
last week, I believe we should go big. 
We should aim high. This is a tremen-
dous opportunity to pass a major bill 
that will benefit our country as a 
whole and the States we represent. We 
cannot let one of the most bipartisan 
policy areas in Washington get derailed 
now because a narrow majority in the 
Senate decided to pursue a partisan, 
shortsighted goal instead. 
I am committed to advancing an in-
frastructure package that is bold, bi-
partisan, and meets the demands of the 
moment, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
let me read to you a section of the pro-
posal on infrastructure that has been 
put out by the White House, just one 
section of many sections that are 
there. This particular section on na-
tional critical infrastructure reads this 
way: 
Funds for schools to reduce or eliminate 
the use of paper plates and disposable mate-
rials. 
I don’t know what your definition of 
‘‘infrastructure’’ is, but I don’t meet a 
lot of Oklahomans who, when I say ‘‘in-
frastructure,’’ they think school lunch 
trays. 
We need to work on infrastructure, 
and I would tell you, I don’t meet a Re-
publican who is not engaged in this 
issue of infrastructure. And it is not 
the first time for any of us to work on 
infrastructure; we have had multiple 
bills. I remind people around my State 
that every time you are driving around 
my State and you see an orange con-
struction zone and a flashing sign, that 
is a previous infrastructure bill that 
was done. In every direction that you 
go in my State, you are going to see in-
frastructure that is already happening 
and working because working on infra-
structure is a common part of what we 
do. 
Republicans have stepped to the 
table and have said: Let’s work on in-
frastructure together. In fact, it was 
interesting—President Trump over and 
over again talked about working on in-
frastructure and tried to be able to get 
a major infrastructure proposal. 
Our definition of ‘‘infrastructure,’’ 
though, doesn’t include school lunch 
trays. We would like to work on high-
ways. This particular package that the 
White House has sent us, we have just 
raised our hands and said: We have a 
few questions before you want to be 
able to move this forward. 
This particular proposal spends $174 
billion for electric vehicles but only 
$115 billion for the highways that they 
will drive on. We just believe we need 
to spend more on highways. We don’t 
mind incentivizing electric vehicles, 
but, quite frankly, there have been a 
lot of incentives out there already. 
Every Tesla that you pull up next to, 
when you turn over and see them at a 
stoplight, you should ask for your turn 
to drive because every one of those 
beautiful Tesla vehicles, the Federal 
taxpayers also kicked in $7,800 in Fed-
eral tax subsidies for that beautiful 
$60,000 automobile that someone else is 
driving. 
There have been tax incentives that 
have been out there for electric vehi-
cles; we just believe we need to spend 
more on actually dealing with our 
roads and bridges because they have 
major problems. 
So what can we do? For those of us in 
Oklahoma, we know full well. I–35, 
Interstate 44, Interstate 40 all cross in 
my beautiful State. We are the center 
of the country in trucking. We are the 
center of the country in railways. We 
have the farthest, northernmost inland 
port that is actually in Oklahoma, 
where a lot of wheat and fertilizer 
move through our State, coming from 
the north to get into the ports to be 
able to get out. 
We understand the significance of 
what it means to be able to work on 
our ports, our waterways, our high-
ways, our bridges; to deal with clean 
water, to deal with sewage water; to be 
able to deal with even broadband. All 
those things are essential for every 
farm to be able to operate and for 
every section of our economy to be able 
to function. 
Let’s work on this together. Let’s 
find a way that we can actually hit 
common ground and agree that work-
ing on airports and working on high-
ways and working on bridges is vital to 
us, and then let’s talk about the rest of 
the other things on this because we 
have a lot of debt as a country, and 
adding another $2.5 trillion and having 
a debate about a corporate tax change 
that—quite frankly, in 2017, when we 
made that corporate tax change, 70 per-
cent of the difference in those compa-
nies went to employees’ wages. Now to 
go back and to raise that corporate tax 
again, we know exactly what that is 
going to mean for employees of those 
companies and future raises that they 
may or may not get. 
So let’s actually talk about this, and 
let’s work on infrastructure together, 
but let’s actually work on what is truly 
infrastructure. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Wyoming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2105 
April 21, 2021 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to associate 
myself with the remarks from the Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
We are here as Republicans who be-
lieve in free markets, and so do the 
American people. The Democrats, on 
the other hand, are running a 100-yard 
dash towards socialism. They have de-
cided to redistribute America’s wealth. 
President Obama used to call this 
‘‘spreading the wealth around.’’ Demo-
crats are taking the wealth of our Na-
tion and they are gathering it up in 
Washington, DC, and deciding then how 
they want to spend it. 
In March, President Biden signed a 
big payoff to the people who run the 
Democratic Party—the union bosses, 
the DC bureaucrats, and bankrupt blue 
States. He said it was a coronavirus re-
lief bill. Yet only 9 percent of the 
money actually went for healthcare. 
Just weeks later, President Biden 
came back again, now requesting $2.7 
trillion under the namesake of ‘‘infra-
structure.’’ When you read through it, 
it looks like once again he is trying to 
spread the wealth around, gathering it 
not for what we consider traditional in-
frastructure—roads, 
bridges, 
ports, 
highways, airports, waterways, all of 
those things, dams, reservoirs, you 
name it—it seems that once again it is 
going for the Democratic elites. It 
looks to me to be a slush fund for lib-
eral spending, going to union bosses, 
climate activists, and the Silicon Val-
ley contributors to the party. 
Where is the money coming from? 
The last bill went on the credit card. 
The next one is coming out of the wal-
lets of the American people. President 
Biden is proposing the largest tax in-
crease in a generation. Working fami-
lies and small businesses are going to 
be on the hook. They will put the 
American worker at a disadvantage. 
Look, there hasn’t been a proposed 
tax increase of this size in this cen-
tury. It is going to affect everyone in 
this country, and it is going to be a 
rude awakening for the many small 
businesses that are finally reopening 
after living the past year with the 
coronavirus pandemic. Now, in addi-
tion to the struggle they have been 
through, they are going to be hit with 
a big tax increase. Now, in addition to 
the struggles they have been through, 
they are going to be hit with a big tax 
increase. 
Now, we know who is going to end up 
footing the bill for the President’s tax 
hikes. He may say that it is just cor-
porations. The American people are 
going to be hit with this tax increase. 
You can call it a tax hike on corpora-
tions, but that absolutely just rico-
chets back onto the people who work 
for those businesses and who buy the 
products of those businesses. 
President Biden is going to try to 
spin it another way, but the highest 
costs of all of this is going to be borne 
by American families. 
Higher taxes, of course, mean fewer 
jobs. One estimate says that the bill is 
going to kill a million jobs. These 
aren’t CEO jobs. These are middle-class 
jobs. These are the jobs of hard-work-
ing families in my state of Wyoming 
and in States all around the country. 
Prices across the country are already 
going up under President Biden. The 
cost of energy went up 9 percent just 
last month. Gasoline prices are up over 
50-cents a gallon since President Biden 
took office and started his Executive 
orders attacking American energy. 
If this bill that is being proposed now 
under the name of infrastructure be-
comes law, well, we will know that the 
price increases are just beginning. Be-
cause of President Biden, more wealth 
is about to be taken from places all 
across middle America and certainly in 
my home State of Wyoming. It will be 
sent to the Democrat elites in Manhat-
tan and Silicon Valley and, of course, 
here in Washington, DC. 
Democrats are focused on redistrib-
uting our wealth. They want to take it 
from working families and give it to 
their liberal donors. It is a bad law. It 
is bad economics. And I urge my col-
leagues to stand for jobs, for higher 
wages, and for the working men and 
women of our Nation, who know what 
infrastructure really means and the 
kind of infrastructure they need for 
their communities. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
join my colleagues today to address the 
ongoing discussions taking place in 
Congress among the executive branch 
and in communities across the country 
about the state of our Nation’s infra-
structure and how to improve it to pro-
pel our economy forward and enhance 
the quality of life in Arkansas and 
every State. 
As a member of the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, I 
understand the importance of infra-
structure investment. I have been a 
constant advocate for water resources 
development, 
surface 
transportation 
investments, and the expansion of 
rural broadband. 
President Biden recently released a 
plan that claims to rebuild America, 
claims to rebuild its crumbling infra-
structure. While I agree that infra-
structure investment must be a top 
priority, I have serious concerns about 
this particular proposal. The President 
should look to the successful example 
of the Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee as a starting point 
for this critical bill. There are a num-
ber of bipartisan infrastructure-related 
bills in the Senate which have been 
thoroughly vetted and are ready to be 
passed. Instead, the administration is 
trying to reinvent the wheel. 
My advice to President Biden is sim-
ple. The path to achieve long-term in-
frastructure improvement is through 
bipartisanship. Just weeks ago, the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee unanimously passed the Drink-
ing Water and Waste Water Act. 
Last Congress, the Committee unani-
mously passed America’s Transpor-
tation Infrastructure Act to provide re-
sources and long-term certainty for 
States and local governments to build 
safer and more modern highways, rail-
roads, and bridges. 
These bills are just two examples of 
the good work the Senate has been 
doing to invest in our Nation’s crum-
bling infrastructure. I am pleased to 
hear this Chamber may begin consider-
ation of the Drinking Water and Waste 
Water Infrastructure Act this month. 
Unlike the House of Representatives 
and the Biden administration, which 
continue to undermine bipartisanship 
by developing and advancing a progres-
sive policy agenda, the Senate has been 
working in a bipartisan manner to find 
solutions for our transportation chal-
lenges. 
If President Biden is listening, my 
message to him is this: Work smarter, 
not harder. There is no reason we need 
to start at the beginning of this proc-
ess. The Senate EPW Committee has 
done the work which can and should be 
the basis for any infrastructure pro-
posal. 
I have always said that if you take 
the ‘‘E’’ out of EPW, we actually get a 
lot done in our committee. For a good 
example of the type of cooperation that 
can be achieved, look no further than 
the work of Senator INHOFE and former 
Senator Boxer. These two colleagues 
had little in common. However, they 
agreed on the importance of infrastruc-
ture investment, and they were able to 
usher major legislation through Con-
gress through a collaborative and de-
liberative process. 
The same is true for Chairman CAR-
PER
and Ranking Member CAPITO. 
While these two have ideological dif-
ferences, they have demonstrated their 
ability to work together to create a bi-
partisan product. 
We want to work with the Biden ad-
ministration on infrastructure to up-
date basic public services, such as safe 
roads and bridges. With innovative fi-
nancing and private sector investment, 
we will be creating jobs and keeping 
commodity prices low while remaining 
competitive in the global marketplace. 
However, we will not tolerate a par-
tisan process where only one side gets 
to offer input with the end result being 
a liberal wish list of projects and prior-
ities that have nothing to do with in-
frastructure investment. 
Infrastructure is about as ripe as any 
area that we have to actually get 
something done of a major nature in a 
bipartisan, cooperative way. 
I am back in Arkansas almost every 
week, and I can tell you what Arkan-
sans want. They want us to be able to 
disagree while also being able to create 
a good commonsense policy. A bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill is a way to 
demonstrate the President’s willing-
ness to work across the aisle. I am 
ready to create a path forward to up-
date and modernize our Nation’s infra-
structure needs as well as make wise

investments in our water systems, en-
ergy grids, and broadband deployment, 
where there is bipartisan agreement on 
the urgent need to act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
simply stated, President Biden’s so- 
called infrastructure plan helps China 
and hurts hard-working Americans. 
Let me say it again. This bill helps 
China and hurts hard-working Ameri-
cans. Less than 5 percent—that is how 
much of this $2 trillion infrastructure 
proposal actually goes toward building 
roads and bridges in the United States. 
Instead, this partisan proposal is load-
ed with Green New Deal pet projects 
and an abundance of spending that 
stretches far beyond recognition of 
what hard-working Americans define 
as infrastructure. 
This is not the first time we have 
seen Democratic attempts to redefine 
the traditional meaning of words. In 
recent weeks, the White House has also 
moved to change how people perceive 
bipartisanship in Congress. No longer 
do our colleagues across the aisle need 
to secure Republican votes in order to 
successfully pass a so-called ‘‘bipar-
tisan’’ bill. One obscure poll with clev-
erly worded questions that helps to 
garner bipartisan support from the re-
spondents will do the trick. It is a ma-
nipulation of words that would allow 
President Biden to try to ram through 
this radical agenda and sell it to the 
American people as fulfilling his cam-
paign promise of unity. 
President Lincoln once said: ‘‘You 
can fool all the people some of the time 
and some of the people all the time, 
but you cannot fool all the people all 
the time.’’ 
The American people won’t be duped 
by Washington doublespeak. I hosted 
five townhalls this past weekend, and 
Kansans have their eyes open to what 
is in this bill. Kansans understand that 
while this bill provides $115 billion for 
roads and bridges, more than half of 
over $2 trillion is devoted to green en-
ergy projects and the elimination of 
fossil fuels. 
Among these green provisions is $170 
billion for electric car chargers and tax 
incentives for purchasing electric cars. 
It also calls for electrifying one-fifth of 
the Nation’s school buses and all 650,000 
of the U.S. Postal Service’s delivery 
trucks, which will result in driving up 
costs to Americans. 
When unveiling this infrastructure 
plan, President Biden mentioned China 
six times as he attempted to sell it as 
a way to compete with China. However, 
this rapid jump to electric vehicles 
does the opposite and will benefit 
China more than many hard-working 
Americans. That is because China leads 
the world in manufacturing 80 percent 
of the materials needed for batteries 
and will continue to do so. Of the 136 
lithium-ion battery plants in the pipe-
line between now and 2029, 101 are 
based in China. 
China mines 64 percent of the world’s 
silicon and makes 80 percent of the 
world’s polysilicon with coal-generated 
electricity—the 
key 
component 
to 
solar panels. This bill will serve as a 
boon for China while decimating our 
domestic oil and gas industry, which 
helped us achieve our long-held goal of 
energy independence in 2019. 
This bill will harm our general eco-
nomic output by taking $2 trillion out 
of the private sector. We should really 
be calling this package the ‘‘grab your 
wallet bill’’ or ‘‘raise your taxes bill.’’ 
The legislation calls for the largest 
corporate tax increase in decades and 
will put the tax burden on American 
companies toward the top of the devel-
oped world list. This will make Amer-
ican companies less competitive in the 
global market. It is a recipe to kill the 
economy at a time when our Nation is 
still recovering from COVID. It will 
also negatively impact our economy in 
the long-term. 
According to projections from the 
Penn Wharton Budget Model, as a re-
sult of this partisan legislation, overall 
GDP will be decreased 0.9 percent lower 
in 2031 and 0.8 percent lower in 2050. 
Hourly wages would be down by 0.7 per-
cent in 2031 and 0.8 percent in 2050. 
Perhaps what is most disappointing 
is that this bill demonstrates that gone 
are the days when infrastructure pack-
ages were an opportunity to build bi-
partisan bridges. Thanks to Repub-
licans’ control of the Senate and reach-
ing across the aisle, the two most re-
cent bills governing spending on roads 
and bridges both passed with over-
whelming bipartisanship support before 
they were signed into law. 
So in case there is still an oppor-
tunity for bipartisanship, let me tell 
you what I am for. I am for a package 
that, No. 1, reaches across the aisle and 
rebuilds our aging roads and bridges; 
next, incentivizes innovation, invests 
in future generations, ensures high- 
speed internet for all Americans, and 
reforms our permitting process so that 
when we say ‘‘shovel-ready,’’ we really 
mean shovel-ready, as opposed to going 
through years of permitting and driv-
ing up the cost of the project. 
Look, pre-COVID, we had the strong-
est economy in my lifetime, thanks to 
Republican-led policies put in place 
over the last 4 years. Lower taxes and 
deregulation resulted in historically 
low unemployment rates, as well as en-
ergy independence and affordable en-
ergy costs. We need to get back to 
these policies and not continue the on-
slaught of harmful redtape, proposed 
tax 
increases, 
and 
unprecedented 
spending sprees. 
The future of our children and grand-
children depends on it. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would guess if the American people 
could give us a word of advice in the 
Senate, they would suggest that we do 
our best to work together and to try to 
establish priorities and meet them, and 
that we try to bring to the new admin-
istration of President Joseph Biden the 
most competent and qualified people 
that we can to help our Nation through 
this pandemic and our economic recov-
ery. It is in that spirit that I close the 
debate on Vanita Gupta to be the next 
Associate Attorney General of the 
United States. 
Yesterday’s verdict in Minnesota cer-
tainly caught the attention of many in 
America and across the world. The kill-
ing of George Floyd was resolved in a 
court of law. Sadly, he will not be with 
us, but his legacy lives on, and it de-
pends on us to use that legacy to make 
America a better nation. 
Can we really come together and put 
law enforcement at the table with com-
munity leaders and civil rights leaders 
and find common ground? 
Can we keep our streets and commu-
nities and neighborhoods safe and do it 
without discrimination against any 
person or group in America? 
These are big challenges—tough chal-
lenges. But to meet them, we need the 
right people in positions of leadership. 
Vanita Gupta is one of those people. 
As a former civil rights advocate, she 
did extraordinary things—in Tulia, TX, 
and 
many 
other 
places—to 
show 
progress in the area of civil rights. 
As a former acting Assistant Attor-
ney General in charge of civil rights, 
she worked with law enforcement orga-
nizations to try to resolve the very 
problems that we have seen in Min-
nesota and Illinois and virtually in 
every other State. She is a dedicated 
professional with an extraordinary re-
sume who wants to continue to serve 
this Nation. 
Will she be able to work with law en-
forcement groups? Well, they think so 
because they support her. There is a 
long litany: National Sheriffs’ Associa-
tion, Major County Sheriffs of Amer-
ica, International Association of Chiefs 
of Police, Major Cities Chiefs, 53 
former police chiefs or sheriffs, the Po-
lice Executive Research Forum, the 
Federal Law Enforcement Officers As-
sociation. The list goes on and on. 
But the simplest statement that was 
made comes from a pretty hard-nosed 
group, the Fraternal Order of Police, 
and those who are in politics know you 
have to work to earn their support. 
Here is what they said about Vanita 
Gupta: ‘‘Gupta always worked with us 
to find common ground, even when 
that seemed impossible.’’ 
Isn’t that exactly what we want at 
this moment in American history as we 
cope with the civil rights challenges of 
our age? This is our chance. 
I hope the Senate, with its vote—I 
hope it is a bipartisan vote—will give 
Vanita Gupta the chance to serve 
America again. 
I yield the floor.

The nomination was confirmed. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first I just want to say, before I move 
on a motion to discharge, it is really so 
good to have Vanita Gupta now in-
stalled as Associate Attorney General. 
To have someone with such a back-
ground in civil rights at this time in 
American history is so important and 
so vital to the country. 
I am so glad that the Senate has now 
approved her and she can do her vital 
job, including dealing with the sys-
temic bias we have seen in policing and 
in law enforcement throughout the 
country. So it is very good news for the 
forces of equality and justice in the 
country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask that the motion to reconsider be 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate and that 
the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee 
on Armed Services being tied on the 
question of reporting, I move to dis-
charge the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices from further consideration of the 
nomination of Colin Hackett Kahl, of 
California, to be Under Secretary of 
Defense for Policy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the time be equally divided 
during the quorum call. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The senior Senator from Oklahoma. 
NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT KAHL 
Mr. INHOFE. Let my start by urging 
my colleagues in the Senate to vote 
against the motion to discharge from 
the Senate Armed Services Committee 
the nomination of Colin Kahl for Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy. This is 
not a decision I take lightly. I have al-
ways felt that any new administration 
should have his team or her team, and 
I have generally been very supportive. 
When President Biden nominated Dr. 
Kahl for this position, my expectation 
was that, if confirmed, he and I would 
often disagree on policy, but we would 
actually get along together; we could 
coexist together. I quickly learned that 
this would really be impossible with 
Dr. Kahl. I don’t think I have ever said 
that about any nominee for any posi-
tion that I can recall. 
My Republican colleagues in the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee—all 12 
of them—reached the same conclusion. 
We opposed his nomination unani-
mously. That is very unusual. 
Before I explain why not a single Re-
publican was able to support Dr. Kahl’s 
confirmation in committee, I want to 
emphasize how rare this is. The Senate 
Armed Services Committee, as every-
one knows, is extremely bipartisan, 
certainly in the years that I was 
chairing that committee with Ranking 
Member JACK REED. We got along fa-
mously. We got things done that other 
people couldn’t get done. 
The Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee has always been bipartisan. We 
have disagreements, of course, but Re-
publicans and Democrats on the com-
mittee have a legacy of consensus. Na-
tional security and taking care of our 
troops are bipartisan concerns. This is 
how we succeeded in passing the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act is the largest bill every year. It is 
the one where it sets out the guidelines 
for the coming year, and it is the one 
where we always have gotten along. We 
passed it every year for 60 consecutive 
years. It shows and demonstrates very 
clearly how well we get along. 
The Department deserves a nominee 
with bipartisan credibility. You have 
to keep in mind this position is the No. 
3 position in the Pentagon. It rep-
resents our shared bipartisan vision of 
effective national security and healthy 
civil-military relations. 
This position demands a nominee 
who can carry out the President’s poli-
cies while engaging those who disagree 
in good faith. That isn’t the case with 
this nominee. That is why we are faced 
with this vote today. 
I also want to clear up a common 
misunderstanding. Republicans on the 
committee did not vote against Dr. 
Kahl simply because we disagreed with 
his policy views. Policy is what that 
position is. It is the policy position of 
the Pentagon. This should be obvious 
to anyone who paid attention to the 
confirmation 
of 
President 
Biden’s 
nominees for Secretary of Defense and 
Deputy Secretary. We got through both 
of them quickly. I don’t remember a 
time when any new administration got 
the two very significant positions of 
Secretary of Defense and Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense so fast. We got them 
in record time. There are some things 
that we disagree with policywise, but 
we supported their confirmation, as did 
most of my Republican colleagues, for 
one reason: They were eminently quali-
fied. I am talking about the Secretary 
of Defense and the Deputy Secretary. 
Both of them were eminently qualified, 
with long track records of bipartisan 
cooperation and strong professional 
judgment. I have dealt with both of 
them for many, many years. 
In fact, we expedited the nomination 
to give the President his national secu-
rity team just about as quickly as we 
could. Republicans may disagree with 
him, but we can work with them very 
well. 
Unfortunately, the same cannot be 
said of Colin Kahl. The national secu-
rity problems we face are wicked and 
complex. We wrestle with them con-
stantly on this committee. 
What I cannot support are nominees 
who reduce complex national security 
conversations to partisan sound bites. 
For instance, as many of my colleagues 
will recall, back in October of 2019, Re-
publicans and Democrats disagreed 
about our policy in Syria. When Presi-
dent Trump announced a full U.S. 
troop withdrawal from northeastern 
Syria, some of our colleagues worried 
about extended deployments. This is a 
reasonable concern because here is how 
Dr. Kahl chose to characterize it: Re-
publicans are ‘‘the party of ethnic 
cleansing,’’ he wrote. He actually said 
that. He said that publicly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2108 
April 21, 2021 
Good and kind people can disagree 
with each other. They don’t have to re-
sort to name-calling and accusations of 
war crimes. 
That is not an isolated example, as 
we discovered during our review of 
Kahl’s writings and public statements. 
He often embraces conspiracy theories. 
For example, he alleged a ‘‘Kushner- 
Kremlin quid pro quo’’ referring to the 
President’s son-in-law. And when given 
the opportunity to correct this type of 
conspiracy theory during his confirma-
tion hearings, he refused to do it. He 
stood by those statements. 
Dr. Kahl also has a long history of 
claiming every policy decision with 
which he disagrees will lead to war. 
Thankfully, he has never been right. 
Dr. Kahl predicted that President 
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 
Iran deal would lead to war. It didn’t. 
He said by sanctioning Iran’s Foreign 
Minister, President Trump was boxing 
‘‘himself into war.’’ There was no war. 
It didn’t happen. 
At one point, Dr. Kahl suggested that 
President Trump might ‘‘start a war 
with Iran for political diversionary 
purposes.’’ This is a ridiculous claim. 
Obviously, it didn’t happen. 
According to Dr. Kahl, the strike on 
Iranian terrorist leader Soleimani, the 
appointment of John Bolton as Na-
tional Security Advisor, and the events 
of the Korean Peninsula, among others, 
were going to lead to war. And none of 
the wars happened. 
His public declarations and policy 
judgment are consistently partisan and 
consistently wrong. The Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy serves as 
the Defense Secretary’s top national 
security advisor. It requires a leader 
with sound judgment and even tem-
perament, 
and 
Colin 
Kahl 
simply 
doesn’t possess either one of these 
qualities. 
Even worse, Dr. Kahl has a long 
track record of maligning people whom 
he disagrees with. I mentioned the Syr-
ian example earlier. He also said that 
the Republican Party has a ‘‘death cult 
fealty’’ to Trump. That is seriously 
what he said. 
The bare minimum for the Defense 
Department’s top policy position is 
good judgment and even temperament. 
Dr. Kahl lacks both of these qualifica-
tions. It would set a terrible precedent 
if we confirm someone like him for the 
job. 
I have a history of working so well 
with people on both sides, which is why 
I can and have supported many nomi-
nees whose policy views differ from 
mine. That goes with the job. 
We have someone who is elected 
President of the United States. I dis-
agree with him on many of the issues 
having to do with our defense policy, 
but because I trust that while we may 
disagree, they understand that we are 
all trying to do the right thing for our 
Nation and for our kids and our 
grandkids. Unfortunately, I don’t have 
that trust in Dr. Kahl. Confirming him 
would create a real political challenge 
for the Department over the years to 
come. 
Every time DOD lays down a new pol-
icy or makes a critical military deci-
sion, we will have to wonder: Was this 
the decision informed by the Depart-
ment’s skilled professionals or by the 
partisan conspiracy theorist that hap-
pens to run the Department? That is 
why all 13 Republicans on the Armed 
Services Committee voted to reject 
this nominee. This is why I urge my 
colleagues to vote against the motion 
to discharge and urge President Biden 
to consider another nominee—one who 
can work productively with both sides 
of the aisle, even when we disagree. Mr. 
President, I would like to have you 
consider these things to make your job 
and my job a lot easier. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to engage in a 
colloquy with my friend and colleague 
Senator SCOTT from Florida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1105 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
am honored to be on the Senate floor 
with my colleague Senator SCOTT from 
the great State of Florida. We are here 
to talk about an issue that really mat-
ters to both Alaska and to Florida and, 
I would say, that actually matters to 
the whole country. 
Let me begin by saying that, like all 
States, my State, the great State of 
Alaska, struggled through the pan-
demic. There were a lot of challenges. I 
am proud to say that, with regard to 
the health challenges of the pandemic, 
I am very honored and privileged and 
proud to represent a great group of 
Americans, my fellow Alaskans, who 
came together on the health side de-
spite our huge challenges in terms of 
its being a giant State with a dispersed 
population. 
We worked together, and on so many 
indicators of health that were directly 
related to the pandemic, Alaskans did 
very well. We were the No. 1 per capita 
in terms of testing throughout almost 
the entire pandemic. Remarkably, we 
have been the No. 1 State per capita in 
terms of vaccine distribution, which is 
a mini miracle, if you know Alaska, 
given how big it is. We had vaccines 
going out of snow machines, dog 
sleds—you name it. We were getting it 
out to everybody in a more efficient 
way than in any other State in the 
country and, importantly, thank God, 
with one of the lowest per capita death 
rates in the country. We are proud of 
that. 
Yet our economy—like many but I 
would say almost uniquely—is getting 
hammered, and people are suffering 
economically, first by the pandemic, of 
course, and now, unfortunately, by our 
own Federal Government. Let me just 
give a couple of examples. 
The energy sector is very important 
to Alaska and very important to Amer-
ica, and, yes, we still need energy. Oil 
and gas, we need them. We have some 
of the greatest workers in the world in 
my State, but the Biden administra-
tion thinks we don’t need them. It has 
been crushing my State with nine Ex-
ecutive orders directed solely at the 
State of Alaska to shut us down—nine 
by this administration. There is no 
State in the country that is getting 
that kind of attention. We don’t want 
that attention. 
Regarding commercial fishing, our 
State has been what I like to call the 
superpower of seafood. Over 60 percent 
of all seafood harvested in America 
comes from Alaska. This has been hurt 
by the pandemic. 
The issue that we are here to talk 
about today is tourism, which is so im-
portant to Alaska and so important to 
Florida, and it is what I want to talk 
about with my good friend Senator 
SCOTT. It is about bringing relief to our 
fellow 
Americans—Floridians, 
Alas-
kans—and working to immediately 
pass the CRUISE Act. That is our bill, 
which would provide relief to coastal 
communities in our country—in Alaska 
and in Florida—and would enable a re-
sponsible return of cruise ship activi-
ties, which are so important to the 
small business owners in our States, 
whose livelihoods depend on having a 
robust tourism sector. 
Let me just very quickly mention 
one thing. Alaska is open for tourism— 
one of the most beautiful places in the 
world. In fact, America, if you want to 
come and have a great vacation, come 
on up to Alaska this summer. Not only 
will you have an amazing experience, 
but we just announced 2 days ago that 
you can get a vaccine. Come on up. If 
your State is too inefficient for you to 
get a vaccine, have a great vacation in 
Alaska, and you will get a vaccine in 
Alaska as well. You can do both. You 
can see the most beautiful State in the 
country. You can fish, see glaciers, 
wildlife, 
climb 
mountains, 
whale 
watch. If you do that, it is going to 
help our economy and help the small 
businesses—fishing guides, hotels. I 
know Americans want to help one an-
other. That is what we have been doing 
for the last year. We want you to come 
up, stay safe, and get a vaccine. 
But here is what we need. To enable 
that to happen in Alaska and in other 
parts of the country, we need the CDC 
to better understand its job, its mis-
sion, and its role. This particularly re-
lates to the issues of cruise ship pas-
sengers and the ability for cruise ship 
vessels to start to return to America’s 
waters as they are doing throughout 
the rest of the world. In Asia, Europe, 
and Latin America, people are cruising 
safely right now, but the CDC is drag-
ging its feet. It is dithering.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2109 
April 21, 2021 
I have been meeting and my staff has 
been meeting with them, certainly, 
weekly. I have met twice with the 
CDC’s Executive Director, but all we 
get is foot-dragging. All we get are ex-
cuses. All we get is guidance that is 
muddled, confusing, and simply un-
workable. 
Here is the thing: In my State, com-
munities are dying, and no one seems 
to care. At the CDC, the bureaucrats 
there don’t seem to give a damn about 
what Americans are suffering through 
right now, literally. I don’t know how 
many times we can be on calls with 
them wherein we get no response. 
When people lose jobs and lose busi-
nesses, that has a health impact too. 
Here is what our simple bill does, the 
CRUISE Act. 
First, it will require the CDC to issue 
recommendations for how to mitigate 
the risks of COVID–19 to passengers 
and crew on board ships. This will be in 
addition to what the industry has al-
ready put forward, and there are over 
70 recommendations. 
Second, our bill will establish an 
interagency working group that will 
develop recommendations to facilitate 
the resumption of passenger cruise ship 
operations in the United States—in 
Florida and Alaska. The recommenda-
tions will facilitate the resumption of 
passenger cruise ship operations no 
later than July 4, 2021. Our bill will re-
quire the CDC, on no later than that 
same day, Independence Day, to revoke 
the order entitled ‘‘Framework for 
Conditional Sailing and Initial Phase 
COVID–19 Testing Requirements for 
Protection of Crew.’’ 
Our bill, finally, ensures that the 
HHS and CDC retain all appropriate 
authorities to make and enforce the 
regulations necessary to prevent the 
introduction, transmission, or spread 
of communicable diseases on individual 
cruise ships. 
This is a commonsense bill. We need 
the CDC to continue to work with us, 
certainly, but to recognize that by 
dragging its feet, tens of thousands of 
Americans are going to continue to 
suffer when they don’t have to. 
We can do this responsibly. My State 
and the State of Florida want to do 
this responsibly, but we can’t wait any 
longer. Our tourism season in Alaska is 
very short. Our businesses need to 
know that they can open again, and 
our citizens need help. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Florida, whose citizens are experi-
encing some of the same devastating 
impacts that my fellow Alaskans are. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I do want to compliment my col-
league. He comes from a beautiful 
State. While I would like all of the 
tourists to come to Florida, Alaska is a 
great State to take a vacation. I have 
had the opportunity to do that a few 
times, and it is a beautiful State. 
I thank my colleagues Senator SUL-
LIVAN and Senator RUBIO for working 
on this bill that is so important to all 
of our States but, for sure, Florida and 
Alaska. 
Many States rely on the success of 
our ports, our cruise lines, and our 
maritime industries. Throughout my 
time as the Governor of Florida, we 
proudly welcomed more than 100 mil-
lion visitors every year and shattered 
annual tourism records each year. 
Every visitor to our State supports 
small businesses, fuels job growth, and 
boosts tax revenue, helping to create 
State and local investments in the en-
vironment, transportation, public safe-
ty, and education. 
And it is not just Florida and Alaska. 
Tourism, including our all-important 
cruise industry, has huge impacts for 
States across our Nation and the thou-
sands of jobs that rely on its success. 
On the chart you can look at this. 
So, first off, the cruise industry shut-
down is just killing a lot of jobs—jobs 
all across this country. Before the 
COVID–19, we had 450,000 jobs—450,000 
American jobs—and $55 billion in GDP 
every year in our economy. 
Unfortunately, due to the suspension 
of cruises caused by the CDC inaction, 
more than 300,000 American jobs have 
been lost. So this is all across our 
country. 
As we continue to work to recover 
from the coronavirus and get our econ-
omy back on track, I remain com-
mitted to doing everything I can to 
support our tourism industry in Flor-
ida, Alaska, and all across the country 
in a safe manner. 
Unfortunately, while many sectors of 
the economy have been safely oper-
ating for months under CDC guidelines, 
Floridians and those across the Nation 
who rely on the cruise industry for 
work, continue to wait, wait, wait, 
wait for updated guidance from the 
CDC. 
For months, I have heard from small 
business owners who have shared just 
all their stories about how important 
tourism is to them and, specifically, 
that the cruise industry is to their 
livelihood and how much the CDC’s de-
cision here has hurt them. 
Let me give you an example. Omar 
Otero, founder and owner of VOK Pro-
tective Services, says: 
As a business owner, I’ve been dependent 
on the cruise industry for my livelihood for 
20 years, and this pause has been dev-
astating. What many people don’t see behind 
the scenes is that cruising has a significant 
impact on many small businesses, and em-
ploys hundreds of thousands of people in 
America. Resuming cruising is critical to my 
business and would allow me to work again 
and support my family. 
Jeannette 
Pineiro, 
president 
of 
Cruiseport Destinations, says: 
The uncertainty we’ve been living with the 
last year is probably the most devastating 
mentally for a business owner. I have former 
employees that are still unemployed. They 
want to get back to work, and there has been 
nothing I could do. The cruise industry needs 
to be treated on par with other sectors of the 
travel industry, and this legislation would 
provide a plan to safely resume cruise oper-
ations. 
The CDC’s refusal to properly address 
this shutdown is wrong. It is time to 
get the cruise lines open, and it is 
going to create jobs all across the 
country. 
That is why I am proud to join my 
colleagues Senator SULLIVAN and Sen-
ator RUBIO in introducing the CRUISE 
Act, which says we are not waiting on 
the CDC any longer. 
In March, President Biden announced 
the effort to vaccinate all Americans— 
his plan to vaccinate all Americans by 
July 4. 
As of this week, all adults will be eli-
gible for COVID–19 vaccines. Our Na-
tion has made enormous progress in 
fighting COVID–19. Yet the CDC has 
continued to act like we are still in 
March 2020. Meanwhile, as my col-
league from Alaska said, there is cruis-
ing all over the rest of the world. 
My colleagues and I are simply ask-
ing the CDC to provide a timeline of 
when the cruise industry can begin to 
reopen, like so many other sectors, and 
the CRUISE Act ensures they can do 
that in a safe manner. 
The CDC is treating the cruise sector 
unfairly, while other industries are 
open for business. There is no reason 
why America’s cruise industry and the 
thousands of jobs that rely on its suc-
cess should continue to suffer. 
Cruises can and should resume, and 
we are going to do everything we can 
to bring back cruising safely. 
I yield to my colleague from Alaska. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1105 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed, and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I under-
stand the position of my colleagues 
from Alaska and Florida who want to 
see a return to cruising by July 4. I am 
there with them. The cruise industry 
in my home State supports over 5,500 
jobs and creates $900 million in annual 
local business revenue. Those jobs and 
that impact on the local economy have 
been severely disrupted, but we have to 
ensure the safety of our friends and our 
families on these cruises before they 
disembark. 
We have seen firsthand how dev-
astating COVID outbreaks on cruise 
ships can be. Just last year, we saw 
thousands of passengers stranded on 
cruise ships—people put in quarantine 
or refused entry to ports as borders 
closed. 
Over 31 million Americans have con-
tracted COVID, and 560,000 have died

from this disease. Cruise ships require 
specific focus and protocols in place to 
prevent future outbreaks. 
While I am as eager as anyone else to 
see a return to travel, we cannot cut 
corners. Doing so risks lives and will 
only further delay returning to normal, 
hurting our economy more in the long 
run. 
We must trust the science, and we 
must allow the CDC to continue its 
work to help us return to what we love 
as safely as possible. 
So I will continue to work with the 
CDC and the administration as they de-
velop the next phase of their cruising 
guidance, but for now, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, to 
my colleague from Washington, whom I 
have the utmost respect for, it is true 
that at the beginning of the pandemic, 
there were all kinds of challenges with 
the cruise ship industry. There is no 
doubt about that. We saw that, but 
that was over—well over—a year ago. 
We didn’t know anything about the 
virus then, we didn’t have vaccines 
then, and we didn’t see the economic 
devastation then. It is a very different 
period right now, a year later. 
What we are asking for is the CDC to 
move. That is what our bill does. 
You know, Senator MURKOWSKI and I 
had a meeting—our second meeting— 
with the CDC Director just 3 weeks 
ago, and in that meeting she told us 
that they were going to issue all the 
guidance for the cruise ships—issue it 
all so people can plan. They said that 
they could anticipate with this guid-
ance that we could meet cruising op-
portunities to start by mid-July in 
Alaska. They said that with this guid-
ance the CDC wouldn’t have to be ap-
proving every move—every move going 
forward—and they said that they would 
take 
into 
consideration 
this 
huge 
progress we have made on vaccinating 
Americans. 
In my State, in southeast Alaska, 
there are communities with 60, 70, 80 
percent vaccination rates. That is 
where these cruise ships are going to be 
going. 
The unfortunate thing is that not one 
thing the Director of the CDC told us 
turned out to be true. That is not good. 
Her staff or somebody in the CDC needs 
to be held responsible for telling us 
something that was not true at all. 
Again, what is happening right now 
is an economic and health devastation. 
In my State, the estimates are up to $3 
billion worth of damage just in Alaska 
alone because of the foot-dragging, 
mixed messages, and unresponsiveness 
when it comes to the CDC’s guidance. 
As my friend from Florida just men-
tioned, airlines, schools, hospitals, and 
hotels have all gotten CDC guidance 
and have been able to open. But for 
some reason, they are focused on this 
industry, which negatively impacts 
thousands of small businesses across 
America, in Florida and Alaska. And I 
certainly hope that the CDC, seeing 
that we are trying to move this—and it 
is a bipartisan issue, by the way—will 
start to do its job—will start to do its 
job and make the commitment that 
was made to me and other Senators to 
get this moving quickly in terms of 
guidance so we can be having tourism, 
cruise ships, and otherwise in America 
by mid-July. That is what I was told by 
the Director 3 weeks ago. They need to 
keep that commitment. 
I yield to my good friend from Flor-
ida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, well, I am clearly disappointed 
that my colleague from Washington 
would object to this commonsense pro-
posal. 
The cruise industry impacts thou-
sands of jobs, not just in Florida and 
not just in Alaska but in the State of 
Washington. Everybody here I know 
wants to make sure that we can start 
cruising again in a safe manner. 
Let’s remember what my colleague 
was talking about. She was talking 
about what was going on in March and 
April in 2020. But today, hotels are 
open, airlines are flying, beaches are 
open, restaurants are open, tourism 
sites are open, and amusement parks 
are open. They are all open, but for 
whatever reason, the CDC has made the 
decision to not allow cruising to hap-
pen, and they have singled out this in-
dustry and cannot tell any of us why 
they singled this out. 
All we are asking is for the CDC to 
provide a timeline of when the cruise 
industry can begin to reopen. The 
cruise industry wants to do it safely. It 
is a lot of American jobs, including—I 
think it is—23,000 jobs and a billion 
dollars in economic impact in the 
State of Washington. 
So I know everybody says they want 
to get this done, but the only way this 
is going to happen is if we make sure 
that we force the CDC to finally make 
a decision and allow the cruise indus-
try to get open again in a safe manner. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT KAHL 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
Colin Kahl is President Biden’s nomi-
nee to be the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Policy. This is the top stra-
tegic planning position at the Depart-
ment of Defense—the No. 3 position at 
our Department of Defense. The role is 
critically important to the national se-
curity of our country and the safety of 
our allies around the world. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Kahl is tem-
peramentally and professionally unfit 
to hold this—or, for that matter, vir-
tually any other—job at the Pentagon. 
He is impulsive, intemperate, offensive, 
and has consistently demonstrated ter-
rible judgment. 
For the past several years, Mr. Kahl 
has endeavored, for some inexplicable 
reason, to be something of a Twitter 
celebrity—not 
exactly 
aiming 
his 
sights high. In pursuit of this goal, he 
has personally attacked the character 
and reputation of virtually every Re-
publican Senator, as well, I would say, 
with lots of Democratic Senators. 
He has tweeted that Members of both 
parties who supported the withdrawal 
from the terrible Iran nuclear deal 
‘‘won’t be satisfied until they get the 
war they pushed for decades.’’ 
He wrote that 45 Senators who sup-
ported weapon sales to Saudi Arabia 
share ‘‘ownership of the world’s worst 
humanitarian crisis.’’ This claim, in 
which he referred to the war in Yemen, 
of course, ignores the role of Iran’s 
murderous, terrorist proxies, some-
thing, of course, that Colin Kahl re-
peatedly turns a blind eye to every-
where in the world—Iran’s evil malig-
nancy. 
On a separate occasion, Mr. Kahl said 
that every Republican who supported 
an end to combat operations in Syria 
‘‘debased themselves at the altar of 
Trump.’’ He then added that the party 
of Lincoln is ‘‘the party of ethnic 
cleansing.’’ Let’s let that sink in for a 
moment. 
Joe Biden has nominated a man to be 
the No. 3 official at our Department of 
Defense who has accused one of the two 
main political parties in our country as 
being ‘‘the party of ethnic cleansing.’’ 
It is hard to imagine an uglier or more 
vicious accusation than that. 
Perhaps Mr. Kahl could ask Bill Clin-
ton and Susan Rice, on whose watch 
the ethnic cleansing in Rwanda hap-
pened. 
When John Bolton was about to be-
come the National Security Advisor, 
Mr. Kahl, quite reasonably, stated on 
social media: ‘‘We are going to die.’’ 
To my knowledge, we are not dead, 
and Mr. Kahl is very much alive, de-
spite John Bolton being appointed as a 
staffer in the U.S. Government. He also 
claimed that the Republican Party had 
a ‘‘death cult fealty’’ to former Presi-
dent Trump. These statements and 
many more make it difficult to con-
ceive of a circumstance in which this 
nominee could successfully forge a pro-
ductive relationship with Members of 
the Republican Party in the Senate or 
the House or anywhere else, for that 
matter. 
Mr. Kahl’s ranting and raving on so-
cial media in 2017 may have even gone 
from offensive to criminal on several 
occasions. It appears that several of 
Mr. Kahl’s tweets divulge or confirm 
classified and sensitive information. I 
recently joined 17 of my fellow Sen-
ators in requesting a full FBI inves-
tigation into this very serious and 
troubling matter. No vote should occur 
until that important inquiry takes 
place. 
Now, the nominee’s transgressions on 
social media are somewhat reminiscent 
of Neera Tanden’s foolish statements 
on that social media platform. I think 
this Chamber set a reasonable standard 
when it rightfully rejected her nomina-
tion, and we ought to maintain that 
standard with this nominee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2111 
April 21, 2021 
In many ways, though, Mr. Kahl’s be-
havior is worse than Ms. Tanden’s be-
cause his poisonous partisanship, his 
narrow-sightedness, and his short tem-
per will directly affect his job. He is up 
for a post that is less partisan and 
more cooperative in nature than was 
Ms. Tanden’s. His position will require 
him to be under extreme stress, where 
he will need to listen to a full range of 
options, engage in careful deliberation, 
and regularly make life-and-death deci-
sions. I have to say, his auditions as a 
social media celebrity over the last 5 
years don’t inspire confidence in his 
ability to do so. 
When I asked him about this at his 
hearing, he said he may have gotten 
caught up in the passions of the mo-
ment or that these were stressful, try-
ing times. Some of these social media 
statements, I would point out, came in 
the middle of the night when Mr. Kahl 
was presumably sitting on his couch at 
home watching his news feed. If he 
thinks that is a stressful or trying mo-
ment, what is he going to do when he is 
sitting in the Pentagon and Vladimir 
Putin is invading southern Ukraine? 
Talking about foreign policy deci-
sions, I would point out that Mr. Kahl 
has been like Joe Biden—wrong about 
nearly every important foreign policy 
decision over the last decade. In 2010, 
Mr. Kahl said that concerns about a 
rapid withdrawal from Iraq were ‘‘exag-
gerated’’ and it was ‘‘very unlikely to 
trigger a dramatic uptick in violence.’’ 
He missed that one by just a little bit 
because soon thereafter, 30,000 radical 
Islamic extremists conquered a quarter 
of Iraq, and ISIS carried out horrific 
terrorist attacks on multiple con-
tinents. 
In 2012, he ridiculed then-Candidate 
MITT
ROMNEY’s, 
now-Senator 
MITT 
ROMNEY’s assertion that Russia was a 
major geopolitical threat. Of course, 2 
years later, Russia invaded Ukraine 
and conquered Crimea. It has since 
been an obsession of the Democratic 
Party, even though Joe Biden has once 
again reverted to the Democrats’ tradi-
tional dovishness on Russia, something 
presumably Mr. Kahl would support. 
In 2017, he predicted that recognizing 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, 
where the seat of Israel’s Government 
is located, would result in a ‘‘third 
Intifada.’’ Instead, Israel has signed 
multiple historic peace deals. 
In 
2018, 
when 
President 
Trump 
warned Iran against pursuing nuclear 
weapons, Mr. Kahl wrote the ‘‘war 
drums are already sounding.’’ But no 
war happened. 
That same year, when President 
Trump withdrew from the terrible Iran 
nuclear deal, Mr. Kahl said: ‘‘War will 
be all that is left.’’ No war happened. 
In 2020, when the United States fi-
nally delivered justice by killing Iran’s 
terrorist 
mastermind 
Qasam 
Soleimani, Mr. Kahl said Mr. Trump 
had ‘‘started a war with Iran in Iraq.’’ 
Yet again, no war happened. 
Mr. Kahl’s inability to accurately as-
sess these events almost defies prob-
ability. After all, even a broken clock 
is right twice a day. 
On issues of war and peace, Mr. Kahl 
is reliably unreliable and consistently 
wrong. This is not a fault that one of 
the chief strategic planners, the No. 3 
official at the Pentagon, and one of the 
most powerful policy advisers in the 
government ought to have. No Pen-
tagon nominee should be this partisan, 
this divisive, and this controversial. 
Republicans have given every De-
fense 
Department 
and 
intelligence 
nominee a fair hearing, and most have 
passed this Chamber with healthy bi-
partisan majorities and in some cases 
unanimously. Mr. Kahl is different. Mr. 
Kahl is different because his toxic 
statements and reputation would in-
hibit the workings of the Department 
of Defense. 
Every time, as Secretary Austin and 
senior Pentagon personnel testify be-
fore the Senate, Members of this body 
will wonder if the policies they are pre-
sented with are the product of hard- 
headed serious planning or the work-
ings of a political hack. 
A man of Mr. Kahl’s judgment and 
temperament and his record of disas-
trous policy judgments is unfit to be 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Pol-
icy, and I will oppose his nomination, 
as every Senator should. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Ala-
bama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
you know, the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Policy serves as the national 
security advisor to the Secretary of 
Defense. This position requires even 
temperament, sound judgment, and a 
willingness to work with both sides of 
the aisle to protect and advance our 
national security. 
As many of my colleagues have 
noted, President Biden’s nominee for 
this important position severely lacks 
these qualities. 
Colin Kahl has promoted conspiracy 
theories on social media. He makes 
outrageous claims against those who 
disagree with him, like when he called 
Republicans 
‘‘the 
party 
of 
ethnic 
cleansing.’’ And he views the threats of 
our Nation solely through the lens of 
partisan politics. 
Dr. Kahl blatantly downplayed the 
threat of Russia when our colleague 
MITT ROMNEY highlighted it during the 
2012 Presidential campaign but then 
promoted numerous lies about Presi-
dent Trump and Russia after the 2016 
election. This is not—and I repeat—not 
the kind of person who should serve in 
the Pentagon’s No. 3 position. 
But today I want to address another 
issue. Dr. Kahl presents himself as an 
academic, but he often makes claims 
that are not grounded in data. That is 
especially true when it comes to the 
situation along our southern border. 
As everybody knows, the illegal mi-
gration crisis is not new. As of 2017, ac-
cording to the Pew Research Center, 
there were an estimated 10.5 million 
unauthorized immigrants in this coun-
try. And according to Pew, over 77 per-
cent of those unauthorized immigrants 
came from within the Western Hemi-
sphere. President Trump came into of-
fice in 2017 promising to do something 
about this challenge: enforce our immi-
gration laws and reinforce southern se-
curity along our border. Dr. Kahl dis-
agreed with his policy, and that is cer-
tainly his right, but rather than ex-
plain why he disagreed, he promoted 
baseless lies. 
In October 2018, a migrant caravan 
surged toward our southwestern bor-
der. President Trump deployed approxi-
mately 5,000 U.S. members of our serv-
ice to support the Department of 
Homeland Security at the border. This 
was not, as some in the media claimed, 
a ‘‘show of force.’’ This was the defense 
support to civil authority’s mission, 
the type of mission that the DOD also 
does to support FEMA during hurri-
canes. 
Dr. Kahl has served previously at the 
Pentagon. He has served as National 
Security Advisor to the Vice President. 
He knows what defense support to civil 
authority is and what these missions 
entail. But rather than explain any of 
this to his many thousands of Twitter 
followers, Dr. Kahl told them that the 
deployment was a ‘‘stunt.’’ This was a 
terrible insult to the men and women 
in uniform who were supporting DHS 
at the time. But more to the point, it 
was also a blatant lie. 
A few months later, Dr. Kahl called 
the situation at the border a ‘‘fake cri-
sis’’ and also tweeted that ‘‘Trump’s 
claims of a border crisis are bogus.’’ 
To justify his claims, Kahl cited data 
showing a decrease in arrests at the 
southern border. But there was one 
problem with his data: arrests along 
the border always decline when border 
enforcement is lax. 
Well, as we know, President Trump 
stepped up enforcement at the border, 
and it worked. As a result, arrests at 
the border surged through the first half 
of 2019. More border security means 
more arrests, but it also deters future 
illegal migrants, and that is why ille-
gal border crossings fell dramatically 
in the second half of 2019. 
Far from being a ‘‘fake crisis,’’ as Dr. 
Kahl would have it, this was a crisis 
that was not being properly addressed 
until President Trump took action. 
Today, we have another crisis at the 
border. We have seen a record number 
of illegal crossings and arrests in re-
cent months as illegal migrants antici-
pate a more welcoming environment 
under President Biden’s administra-
tion. 
The Biden administration has made 
detrimental changes to our border pol-
icy, including ending the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy. But it is worth noting 
what has not changed: U.S. troops are 
still deployed in support of DHS along 
the border. They are still there. Any-
one who has taken the time to visit our 
southern border, as I was there just a 
few weeks ago, understands that if our

troops were not in this region, the cri-
sis at the border would only grow 
worse. 
Colin Kahl saw the deployment as a 
‘‘stunt’’ under President Trump. I sus-
pect he sees it a little differently under 
President Biden. And that is exactly 
the problem: Colin Kahl’s judgment is 
often based on partisan politics, not 
data. 
We cannot accept the risk of having 
someone so partisan in the Defense De-
partment’s No. 3 position. This posi-
tion requires someone who bases his 
recommendations on data and not on 
the top trending hashtag. I urge my 
colleagues to vote against the motion 
to discharge. 
Let Colin Kahl keep tweeting and let 
the administration send us another 
nominee. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

TRIBUTE TO CHRIS MAIER 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today, on behalf of Oregonians in every 
nook and cranny of our wonderful 
State, to thank my friend Chris Maier 
for more than three decades of stellar 
public service. 
Chris is retiring this month as a 
superhero 
who 
has 
been 
cutting 
through redtape and defeating bureauc-
racy for so many Oregonians who 
turned to her nights and weekends and 
all hours. She helped with emergency 
immigration and State Department 
needs, passports, visas, immigration 
questions, and so much more. 
As a casework manager and con-
stituent services representative in my 
office for more than a decade, Chris 
brought an unfailing professionalism, 
determined follow-through, and ‘‘Or-
egon Way’’ focus on smart solutions 
when tackling all of those duties. 
Chris came to our Portland office in 
2009, after a decade of working for my 
friend Senator Gordon Smith. Before 
that, she had worked a total of 11 years 
in the offices of Senator Mark Hatfield, 
Congressman Denny Smith, and State 
Representative Chuck Carpenter. If 
those names that I just mentioned 
were an answer on jeopardy, the ques-
tion would be: Who are four prominent 
elected Republicans in Oregon history? 
The Senate heard that one right. 
Chris is retiring after a career of work-
ing for elected officials from both po-
litical 
parties. 
On 
one 
level, 
she 
worked for all of us as elected officials, 
but on a larger level, she worked for 
everybody in Oregon, regardless of 
their politics. And on that larger level, 
Chris epitomizes so many other public 
servants in Oregon and our country 
whose names just never get celebrated 
in headlines or tweets or news cov-
erage. 
The word ‘‘bipartisan’’ gets tossed 
around a lot, but Chris lived that ethos 
every single day of her public service 
career. When she was responding to the 
uncounted number of calls and email 
inquiries she got over the years, she 
never said: So tell me a little bit about 
your politics. Her response was always: 
How can I help? And she always applied 
her common sense and the deep res-
ervoir of good will she earned nation-
wide to move the levers of government 
quickly and successfully. And as I al-
luded to at the outset, those queries 
and her responses never corresponded 
to an 8-to-5 schedule because she was 
always on the phone to a U.S. Embassy 
somewhere thousands of miles away. 
Chris’s duties went into overdrive in 
the first few weeks this past year dur-
ing COVID. Oregon parents called Chris 
frantic to get their kids home from 
overseas study programs. Oregon fami-
lies and friends would email Chris des-
perate for information about family 
members abroad on travel that they 
had saved a lifetime for. And we had 
businesses from all over Oregon text 
Chris about their U.S. employees who 
were working in other countries. 
On the other end of all of those calls, 
emails, and texts was Chris Maier, al-
ways responding with her experience 
and empathy to figure out solutions. I 
can’t even begin to calculate the num-
ber of times Oregonians would come up 
to me in our iconic ‘‘Fred Meyer’’ sto-
ries, and they would say: RON, let me 
tell you about how Chris Maier went to 
bat for me and my family. 
So today we are very grateful for her 
‘‘Chris Maier’’ brand of tenacity with a 
smile, because she was steering so 
many Oregonians through the unprece-
dented trials of the past year. 
I have been thinking about all the 
challenges she has been helping Orego-
nians with over her entire career, and 
she was helping all those people when 
she was in our office every single day, 
bringing relentless good cheer, an over-
flowing candy bowl, and a love bor-
dering on obsession for University of 
Oregon football. We Ducks take our 
football seriously, but certainly no-
body more than Chris Maier. 
I am going to close with a final 
thought as I send Chris off to a very 
well-earned retirement with her hus-
band Brad and their daughter Kath-
erine, back home on the east side of my 
hometown, Portland. As Chris’s fellow 
Oregon 
football 
fans 
know, 
the 
pregame pageantry at home games in 
Eugene always included the tradition 
of one joyful shout in unison: ‘‘It never 
rains in Autzen Stadium.’’ 
If I may paraphrase that thought 
today in talking about my friend. Her 
optimistic outlook and legacy of suc-
cess means that all of us are joyful be-
cause ‘‘It never rains in Chris Maier’s 
world.’’ 
So, Chris, on behalf of Oregonians 
and communities small and large, we 
are so grateful for all the time you 
went to bat for the people of our State 
and for the people of this country. For 
that we say thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
FIGHT FENTANYL ACT 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to call on my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to join Senator 
PORTMAN
and 
myself—and 
Senator 
PORTMAN will come in later and express 
his desire for this also—in taking ac-
tion to permanently schedule fentanyl 
and deadly fentanyl analogs. 
Fentanyl is 100 times more potent 
than morphine, 50 times more potent 
than heroin, and according to the DEA, 
2 milligrams—just 2 milligrams—of 
fentanyl can cause a lethal overdose. 
In February 2018, the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration issued a tem-
porary scheduling order to schedule 
fentanyl-related substances, which has 
allowed Federal law enforcement au-
thorities to bring criminal actions 
against individuals who manufacture, 
distribute, or handle fentanyl-related 
substances. 
A year ago, this body extended the 
scheduling order through May 6, 2021, 
via unanimous consent. The House ex-
tended it by a vote of 320 to 88. This 
should not be controversial at all. 
In 2019, 36,359 people died because of 
fentanyl. That is 51 percent of all over-
dose deaths that year—51 percent. Over 
half of the people who were killed by 
overdose were by fentanyl. We know 
2020 
was 
a 
record 
year 
in 
drug 
overdoses, mainly driven by fentanyl- 
related substances and the COVID–19 
pandemic. We can safely assume that 
there were at least 44,000 deaths last 
year—think about that—44,000 deaths 
related to fentanyl last year. In total, 
that is over 80,000 people who have died 
because of fentanyl in just the last 2 
years. It is heartbreaking to lose so 
many 
Americans 
to 
preventable 
overdoses. 
The time to permanently schedule 
this deadly substance is now. That is 
why Senator PORTMAN and I reintro-
duced the bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl 
Act to permanently schedule fentanyl 
and fentanyl analogs. I am saying per-
manently 
schedule 
fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl analogs. 
The 
FIGHT 
Fentanyl 
Act 
is 
a 
proactive overdose prevention bill. It 
stops the creation of these drugs and 
removes incentives for people to bring 
these deadly chemicals into our coun-
try, reducing the harm to our fellow 
Americans. 
We know that fentanyl is deadly. It 
is killing Americans at record rates. 
West Virginia, my home State, has the 
highest overdose rates per capita in the 
Nation, and every West Virginian is fa-
miliar with the horrible impacts of the

I recognize there are concerns about

harm than good. But permanently 
scheduling 
fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl 
analogs is not about locking people up; 
it is about keeping our fellow Ameri-
cans alive. 
Don’t take my word for it. We asked 
the GAO to study it—the General Ac-
counting Office to study it. In the last 
3 years since the rescheduling was put 
in place, the GAO found only eight 
prosecutions 
occurred 
related 
to 
fentanyl analogs, four of which were 
associated with drug cartels. If that is 
not enough, our bill also explicitly pro-
hibits new mandatory minimums asso-
ciated with fentanyl analogs. 
Here are the facts: 80,000 deaths com-
pared to 8 prosecutions—80,000 deaths 
compared to 8 prosecutions. 
Here is another fact: We simply don’t 
have the support in Congress today to 
pass the FIGHT Fentanyl Act right 
now. It is hard to believe. We must pass 
another 
short-term 
extension 
this 
week to ensure the essential temporary 
protection does not lapse. I hope my 
colleagues will at least support that ef-
fort. 
I also urge my colleagues, Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 
to 
join 
Senator 
PORTMAN and me in this effort to per-
manently reschedule this deadly, dead-
ly drug. We cannot afford to keep kick-
ing the can down the road as we have 
for far too long. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
my 
friend 
and 
colleague 
Senator 
MANCHIN from West Virginia and I are 
on the floor today to talk about this 
issue of fentanyl. 
This is a deadly synthetic opioid that 
is killing more people in our States 
than any other single drug. Unbeliev-
ably, Congress has only 15 days to act, 
and if we don’t, some of these illegal 
fentanyl products are going to be legal 
again. This is exactly the wrong thing 
for us to do right now as, sadly, we are 
seeing a big increase in overdoses and 
overdose deaths because of the effects 
of the coronavirus pandemic. 
We want to have bipartisan legisla-
tion that we have introduced, passed, 
that simply says: Let’s not allow these 
illicitly manufactured and deadly syn-
thetic opioids to suddenly become legal 
again. 
If we don’t act within 15 days, that 
will happen. Our bill would ensure that 
these deadly drugs continued to be 
scheduled—that is the technical term— 
scheduled by the Drug Enforcement 
Agency, meaning they would continue 
to be illegal. 
Here is why we have to act. Fentanyl, 
a synthetic opioid, is more than 15 
times more powerful than heroin, and 
it is incredibly addictive. For years, 
this has been coming to our shores 
from China, almost all of it through 
the mail until recently because we, 
frankly, passed legislation to cut down 
on mail deliveries, and instead, now 
much is coming through Mexico, across 
our southwest border. 
It is a big reason overdose deaths in 
the United States surged to record 
highs during this COVID–19 pandemic, 
with more than 87,000 Americans— 
think about that—87,000 Americans 
died during the 12-month period be-
tween September 2019 and September 
2020. That is a record. It is a terrible 
record. 
When we have the actual numbers 
from 2020, it is going to be even worse. 
We just got these numbers from Sep-
tember 2019 until September 2020. When 
we have the numbers from January 
2020 through December 2020, it will be 
even worse. That is what everybody 
says, and it makes sense. When you 
look at this data, the worst months are 
the months during the pandemic in 
2020. 
Again, we are very sadly, after sev-
eral years of progress, looking at once 
again an increase in these overdose 
deaths. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 
synthetic opioids like fentanyl are the 
biggest drivers of this tragic surge. We 
can project that more than half of 
these deaths are from this class of drug 
based on what we know from the 2019 
data. That is the latest information we 
have. In 2019, there were 70,630 deaths, 
and more than half of those—36,359—in-
volved fentanyl. Experts believe that 
fentanyl, sometimes mixed with other 
drugs like cocaine or crystal meth or 
sometimes heroin, continues to be the 
No. 1 killer. 
It is such an enormous crisis because 
these drugs are so incredibly dan-
gerous. It takes only 2 milligrams of 
fentanyl to kill an adult, which is why 
the DEA, Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration, 
permanently 
classified 
fentanyl as a schedule II drug. 
In order to avoid prosecution, drug 
traffickers started making slight modi-
fications to fentanyl. You have some 
evil scientist in China or in Mexico 
who makes a slight modification to 
fentanyl, sometimes adjusting a single 
molecule and creating what are called 
fentanyl analogs. In other words, it is 
not precisely pure fentanyl, and so un-
fortunately, although it has the same 
narcotic properties as fentanyl, these 
tiny variations allow these traffickers 
and these scientists to evade prosecu-
tion. Oftentimes, by the way, these 
analogs, like carfentanil, are even 
more deadly, believe it or not, than 
fentanyl itself. 
In response, in 2018, the DEA tempo-
rarily scheduled fentanyl analogs, but 
under law, that designation expires 
after May 6—again, only 15 days from 
now. If that deadline lapses, evil sci-
entists and criminals who run labs in 
China and Mexico will be able to avoid 
law enforcement as they flood the 
United States with unlimited slight 
variations of this deadly drug. 
That is why Senator MANCHIN and I 
are calling on Congress to do the sen-
sible thing: Pass the FIGHT Fentanyl 
Act to make these dangerous sub-
stances permanently illegal. That is 
what law enforcement wants, that is 
what our communities demand, and 
that is what we deserve to give them. 
It is long overdue that we make this 
designation permanent. 
China, by the way, implemented 
classwide 
controls 
over 
fentanyl 
analogs in 2019. China’s law defines 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
more 
broadly than the U.S. Government de-
fines fentanyl-related substances. How 
ironic. Here is China, a country send-
ing us this poison and actually making 
these drugs illegal in China, and they 
are not illegal here. How could that be? 
I know some colleagues oppose per-
manent scheduling of these fentanyl 
drugs 
because 
they 
are 
concerned 
about mandatory minimum sentences 
and also that it could hinder research 
into future medications to treat addic-
tion. Let me address both of those. 
First, I share this concern about the 
harsh punishments that don’t fit the 
nature of the crime. That is why our 
legislation ensures that mandatory 
minimum sentences are not automati-
cally imposed. In any criminal case, we 
want the judge to look at the severity 
of the crime and consider all relevant 
factors in sentencing. So that issue is 
addressed. 
There has been a great deal of con-
versation about the impact of prosecu-
tions and incarcerations on specific 
populations, including minority com-
munities, but what is often lost in this 
debate is the growing impact of fatal 
overdoses in these same communities. 
Since 2016, while White fatalities de-
creased through 2019—the data we 
have—overdoses from opioids among 
Black Americans, particularly Black 
men, have actually accelerated. From 
2011 to 2016, Black Americans had the 
highest increase in synthetic opioid-in-
volved overdose death rates compared 
to all populations. So it is getting 
worse, not better, in these same minor-
ity communities. 
While from 2017 to 2018, overall 
opioid-involved overdose fatalities de-
creased—remember we were making 
progress for the last several years. 
Overall, it decreased by just over 4 per-
cent. Rates among Black and Hispanic 
Americans actually increased. 
Another issue my colleagues have 
raised, again, is concern that perma-
nently 
scheduled 
fentanyl 
and 
its 
analogs somehow hinders research in 
treating addiction. First of all, I agree 
that we need this research and need it 
badly. One example of this is coming 
up with naloxone, a miracle drug based 
on heroin that actually reverses the ef-
fects of overdose. It is a miracle. I have 
seen it work, and it saves lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2114 
April 21, 2021 
Researchers have told me there are 
barriers to being approved to legally 
research schedule I substances. There 
is also a stigma to conducting this 
kind of research even though we know 
that it could lead to development of 
new treatments. I am open to working 
with colleagues to address these bar-
riers, and I believe we can do that 
through legislation creating flexibility 
in the registration system for sci-
entists. But we cannot let these deadly 
fentanyl drugs become legal in the 
meantime, and certainly we can’t allow 
this to happen in the next 15 days. 
Just before we came to the floor this 
afternoon, the House of Representa-
tives passed a temporary measure. It is 
a 5-month extension of the ability to 
schedule 
these 
deadly 
drugs. 
Why 
would we do it for just 5 months? Let’s 
do it permanently. 
Now I am told: Well, we have a take- 
it-or-leave-it from the House. I hope 
that is not the case. If so, of course I 
will be for extending it rather than 
having it expire in 15 days. But let’s 
act. Let’s act responsibly. Let’s act 
now. 
The U.S. Senate should be taking the 
lead here in saying let’s permanently 
classify these drugs, as everybody 
agrees they should be classified in the 
sense that they are dangerous nar-
cotics that are killing literally tens of 
thousands of our fellow citizens every 
year. 
Let’s do the right thing for those 
communities. Let’s do the right thing 
for law enforcement. Let’s be sure they 
have the predictability and certainty 
in law enforcement to know that they 
can prosecute these criminals—these 
traffickers. We need to act now to ad-
dress 
the 
threat 
of 
these 
deadly 
fentanyl drugs coming into our com-
munities, and I urge the Senate to pass 
the FIGHT Fentanyl Act this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT KAHL 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I rise 
to speak in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Mr. Colin Kahl to be Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy. 
The position of Under Secretary of 
Defense for Policy is essentially the 
third most senior leadership position in 
the Department of Defense. It requires 
a leader of tremendous experience and 
knowledge, someone with the ability to 
separate politics from policy. With the 
many national security challenges our 
Nation and the Pentagon face, this po-
sition requires a measured, rational, 
and deliberate leader. It needs a leader 
who puts the safety and security of the 
American people ahead of scoring one 
more point on the political board. The 
head of policy at the Pentagon needs to 
be someone we as a country can trust 
with some of our most delicate secrets. 
The reality is, Mr. Kahl does not meet 
the standard for this position. 
Secretary of Defense Austin and his 
Deputy, Dr. Kathleen Hicks, have af-
firmed before the Senate what the na-
tional defense strategy articulated: 
The most pressing strategic challenge 
facing 
our 
country 
is 
Communist 
China. We know the threat from China 
is long-lasting and very serious. The 
complex actions and efforts of the CCP 
are disrupting the global order and re-
ducing our national security. These ac-
tions demand expertise in the develop-
ment and leadership of our national de-
fense. 
When it comes to President Biden’s 
pick for the head of defense policy, Mr. 
Kahl—well, Mr. Kahl lacks any mean-
ingful experience and has only a sparse 
record of thought on China or anything 
in the broader Indo-Pacific region, for 
that matter. The United States cannot 
afford this lack of knowledge and expe-
rience in a top Pentagon official. 
Now, folks, we can also look to his 
judgment as a matter of concern. Mr. 
Kahl has a record of leniency toward 
Iran—the world’s leading state sponsor 
of 
terrorism—and 
belligerence 
to 
Israel. 
On Iran, I would note that this ad-
ministration is already not taking seri-
ously the threat Tehran poses. Iran fla-
grantly continues to enrich its ura-
nium and inch closer and closer to ob-
taining a nuclear weapon. We, the 
American people, cannot afford for this 
administration to play footsie with 
Iran and kowtow to its demands of 
sanctions relief. 
Based on Kahl’s record, he would be 
one more advocate at the table pushing 
to get the United States back into the 
failed Iran nuclear agreement. Frank-
ly, when it comes to Iran and Israel, 
Mr. Kahl couldn’t be more wrong in his 
understanding of who our friends are 
and who the real threats to America 
are. 
If I am honest, I am deeply dismayed 
that we are even to this point in con-
sideration. The Under Secretary of De-
fense for Policy must be a steadfast, 
measured, and discreet public official. 
Mr. Kahl has proven to be the complete 
opposite. He is brash and unserious in 
his public rhetoric. In fact, he has 
called Republicans ‘‘the party of ethnic 
cleansing,’’ and he played the role of 
Chicken Little in claiming ‘‘we are all 
going to die’’ if one former White 
House adviser were replaced for an-
other. His hysterical—yes, hysterical— 
public comments may have even com-
promised classified information. 
That is why I have joined with many 
of my colleagues in calling for an FBI 
investigation of his handling of classi-
fied information. In having led troops 
overseas during Operation Iraqi Free-
dom—serving in our military for over 
23 years—I believe our servicemembers 
deserve someone who will take a seri-
ous, nonpartisan outlook to policy, 
apply measured thought to his actions, 
and real, qualifying experience to a 
most critical job. 
Mr. Kahl is far from meeting that 
standard. I strongly, strongly oppose 
his nomination and urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to do the 
same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss my serious con-
cerns about the judgment and the tem-
perament of the nominee Colin Kahl, 
the controversial nominee to be the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, 
the third highest position in our De-
partment of Defense. 
On April 13, 2021, I, along with 17 
other Senators, wrote to FBI Director 
Christopher Wray requesting an inves-
tigation into whether Kahl had improp-
erly disclosed classified information. 
We also asked the majority leader not 
to advance Kahl’s nomination to the 
floor until the FBI completes its inves-
tigation. Yet here we stand. 
The 18 Senators who signed these let-
ters include Senators who sit on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, the Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee, and the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
As 
Senators, 
the 
Constitution 
charges us with providing advice and 
consent, and so I stand here today be-
cause the Senate deserves to have 
these questions answered so that we 
may properly discharge our duties. 
I fear my Democratic colleagues 
want to force this nominee through be-
fore we know all the facts—facts which 
may be incredibly damning to his nom-
ination. 
Here is what we do know. As a U.S. 
Government employee with a Top Se-
cret security clearance, Colin Kahl 
signed a classified information non-
disclosure agreement. In fact, he likely 
signed many of them during his tenure 
in government. This document binds 
government employees in perpetuity to 
protect classified information under 
U.S. laws, regulations, and Executive 
orders. 
These classified information non-
disclosure agreements don’t come with 
footnotes. They don’t come with fine 
print that says you are only obligated 
to protect classified information when 
it is a President you like or when it is 
a President that belongs to the polit-
ical party you agree with. 
Mr. Kahl signed this document to 
protect classified information in per-
petuity, period. Rather than uphold the 
oath that he took to his Nation and to 
his government, Kahl decided to reck-
lessly disclose sensitive information to 
secure political points on Twitter. 
Some of the information that Kahl 
appears to have leaked—internal delib-
erations 
of 
the 
National 
Security 
Council—is of a category that even 
Senators and Senate staff with the 
highest security clearances are almost 
always denied access. 
In December of 2017, Kahl publicly 
bragged that he confirmed the disclo-
sure to the media of classified planning 
for military operations in North Korea 
with ‘‘multiple sources inside the Ad-
ministration.’’ 
You can see right here his tweet: 
There is a contingent at the White House 
that believes a limited strike is viable and

S2115 
April 21, 2021 
the US can control escalation by threatening 
regime change if Kim Jong Un retaliates. 
This is incredible. 
Continuing on that same thread, he 
says: 
I’ve heard this separately from multiple 
sources inside the Administration. 
In other words, if the intelligence 
services of North Korea, China, Russia, 
Iran, and other adversaries were work-
ing to corroborate the accuracy of this 
leaked information, Kahl saved them 
the trouble by working with ‘‘multiple 
sources inside the Administration’’ to 
confirm this leaked classified informa-
tion, publicly, no less. 
Let me put this in a personal per-
spective. When Kahl tweeted these 
leaks in December of 2017, I was serving 
as U.S. Ambassador to Japan. This was 
at a time when North Korea had 
launched two intercontinental ballistic 
missiles over Japan, and they had also 
detonated a thermonuclear warhead, 
putting the lives of my family, my fel-
low American diplomats, and more 
than 50,000 Active-Duty U.S. military 
and their families—all of us living 
within 
range 
of 
North 
Korea—in 
harm’s way. 
At a time when tensions couldn’t 
have been higher, Colin Kahl was will-
ing to expose vital information to 
North Korea and risk American lives— 
all of this just to score political points. 
Reckless, I say. 
In February and March of 2017, Kahl 
leaked details about a classified Na-
tional Security Council meeting on 
counterterrorism operations in Yemen 
that he ‘‘confirmed with 4 separate 
staffers in the room.’’ 
Here is his message, talking about 
Yemen, quoting the Deputy National 
Security Advisor, K.T. McFarland, say-
ing ‘‘saddle up.’’ 
The existence of this meeting should 
have been classified and certainly any-
thing that was said during this meet-
ing. Here it is on Twitter. 
Then he follows up by saying he has 
‘‘confirmed with 4 separate staffers in 
the room.’’ 
In short, Kahl used social media and 
other forums to leak classified infor-
mation to brag about his ability to get 
U.S. Government employees to confirm 
with him the veracity of leaked classi-
fied information. 
Whoever holds the third highest posi-
tion at DOD must be someone who 
completely 
understands 
and 
appre-
ciates the important nature of sen-
sitive information and is dedicated to 
safeguarding it. 
Yet rather than respect the responsi-
bility that came with his access to sen-
sitive material, Kahl recklessly shared 
this privileged information on Twitter 
for the world to see, merely to scratch 
political, partisan itch. 
If we let this nominee slide through 
under these conditions, what message 
does it send to other ambitious na-
tional security types? Doesn’t it say 
that leaking classified information for 
political reasons will be rewarded? 
Doesn’t it encourage further disclosure 
of classified information? Doesn’t it 
play right into our adversaries’ hands 
by showing that our internal political 
divisions can be exploited to obtain the 
most sensitive information that our 
government keeps? 
My Senate colleagues and I explained 
in our letter to FBI Director Wray: 
The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy 
plays a key role in matters crucial to Amer-
ica’s national security and should be held by 
a person of sound judgment and tempera-
ment—someone who understands and re-
spects the need to safeguard classified infor-
mation and to keep national security affairs 
distinct and separate from partisan political 
activities.’’ 
Kahl’s growing record of apparent mis-
handling of classified information and his 
evasive response regarding this issue fall far 
short of the standards required for holding 
one of our nation’s top national security po-
sitions. 
By apparently soliciting or otherwise re-
ceiving classified information from U.S. gov-
ernment officials serving in national secu-
rity roles and repeatedly posting such infor-
mation on social media . . . Kahl dem-
onstrated disregard for security protocols 
that are designed to protect our national se-
curity interests. 
Kahl has shown that he is unfit to 
serve and his nomination should not 
move forward until the FBI has com-
pleted the investigation requested by 
me and 17 of my Senate colleagues. 
I hope that all of my colleagues want 
to see answers to these important ques-
tions, as well, before we begin to ad-
vance his nomination.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wel-
come the Vice President, the President 
of the Senate, to our Chamber this 
evening. 
I am here this evening to discuss the 
infrastructure plan that has been pro-
posed by President Biden and the plan 
along with it for massive tax increases. 
The Biden infrastructure plan totals 
a massive $2.3 trillion, but only about 
20 percent of it actually goes towards 
funding anything that Members of ei-
ther party have ever considered infra-
structure. I support more infrastruc-
ture investment, as do, I believe, most 
if not all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. 
The question is, What is infrastruc-
ture, and how do you pay for it? Roads 
and bridges, as an example in this pro-
posal, are only about 5 percent of the 
plan. In fact, it provides more money 
for long-term care than it does for 
roads and bridges, more money for 
electric cars than it does for roads and 
bridges, and more money for schools 
and daycare than it does for roads and 
bridges. Many of these noninfrastruc-
ture ideas are worthy ones, and they 
should be debated and they should be 
considered but not as part of a self-de-
scribed infrastructure bill, in part be-
cause the funding sources should be 
very different. 
The price tag, $2.3 trillion—soon to 
be $2.7 trillion, we are told—and also 
the scope of the bill are bad enough, 
but what I want to talk about tonight 
is the equally concerning way the 
Biden administration plans to pay for 
this massive new legislation. They 
want to pay for the bulk of it by com-
pletely reversing the progress we made

America competitive again and making 
our workers competitive again. 
In the 2 years before COVID–19, we 
saw record growth in jobs and wages, in 
large part thanks to the pro-growth 
policies we put in place through the 
2017 tax cuts and reforms. The non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
has found that 70 percent of the savings 
from the 2017 corporate tax cuts went 
into workers’ wages. Seventy percent, 
they say, went into workers’ pockets. 
It is one reason that, leading up to the 
pandemic in February, a year and a 
couple of months ago, we had the 19th 
straight month—19th straight month— 
of wage growth of 3 percent or more an-
nually. That was great news in my 
home State of Ohio. We hadn’t had 
wage growth like that in over a decade, 
maybe two decades. Most of that ben-
efit, by the way, went to middle and 
lower income workers—exactly what 
you want. 
During that time period a couple of 
years before the pandemic hit, we tied 
the 50-year low in unemployment at 3.5 
percent and had the lowest unemploy-
ment ever for Blacks and Hispanics. In 
fact, before the pandemic, we had 
reached the lowest poverty rate—10.5 
percent—since we started recording 
this data back in 1959. It was the lowest 
poverty rate on record. 
Importantly, tax reform also stopped 
these corporate inversions. You will re-
member this. Companies were actually 
becoming foreign companies so they 
could get from under our Tax Code. 
This made no sense. It was happening 
during the Obama administration and 
during the first year of the Trump ad-
ministration. We also ended the so- 
called lockout effect, caused by a Tax 
Code that made it too expensive to 
bring foreign earnings back home. So 
people kept their earnings overseas. In 
fact, during those couple of years, the 
$1.6 trillion in overseas earnings has 
now come back home to invest and cre-
ate jobs here—$1.6 trillion. We want 
that money here. 
As a result of those changes, the 
largest U.S. companies increased do-
mestic 
research 
and 
development 
spending by 25 percent to $707 billion, 
and capital expenditures went up by 20 
percent to $1.4 trillion. The Biden plan 
would 
throw 
all 
of 
that 
positive 
progress out. It would change our com-
petitiveness to put us back where we 
were before or worse. 
The administration’s corporate tax 
increase raises the combined Federal 
and State corporate rates from an av-
erage of 25.8 percent to 32.8 percent. It 
would put us, again, as having the 
highest rate in the developed world. 
These tax hikes, by the way, when you 
include the international tax hikes, are 
actually five times as large as the cor-
responding cuts in 2017, based on the 
analysis that has been done. By the 
way, this would also, of course, give us 
not just the highest tax rate among the 
developed countries but also a far high-
er tax rate than countries like China 
with whom we are trying to compete. 
It also changes the international tax 
code to make it much more costly for 
U.S. companies to operate outside of 
the United States, punishing American 
workers who have jobs here supporting 
international sales. I use the example 
of Procter & Gamble in my hometown 
of Cincinnati. They are headquartered 
in Ohio, but they do business all over 
the world. They have told me that it 
will be far more expensive for them to 
do that, even uncompetitive for them 
to be working globally, because we will 
be the only developed country in the 
world that will charge them a tax to do 
that, and that will hurt the jobs in Cin-
cinnati, OH, that support international 
sales. 
It just doesn’t make any sense. Why 
would we want to go back to that and 
have that lockout effect where profits 
are kept overseas and where companies 
actually become foreign companies? 
In the Biden plan, it also eliminates 
the so-called foreign-derived intangible 
income provision. This was a carrot 
that we put in the law very delib-
erately, a carrot for companies to bring 
their intellectual property back here. 
By the way, that is what Google did. So 
did Cisco. So did Qualcomm. So did 
Synopsys. So did Facebook. They actu-
ally 
brought 
valuable 
intellectual 
property back home, creating high- 
paying high-tech jobs here in the 
United States of America. Why would 
we want to change that? 
The bottom line is that this tax plan 
that has been proposed would make us 
uncompetitive again in the global 
economy, and the Biden administration 
knows it. 
That is why, when Treasury Sec-
retary Yellen announced the proposal 
to increase these taxes, she actually 
asked other countries around the world 
to raise their own corporate taxes. She 
pleaded with them: We are going to 
raise ours. You need to now raise your 
taxes. 
Of course, when she said we need to 
do that to create a more level playing 
field, other countries in the world said: 
This is great. We are going to get more 
American investment and more busi-
ness for our companies. In fact, right 
after she made that announcement, the 
Minister for Finance in Ireland was 
asked the question. He said he had no 
interest in joining America in raising 
taxes—nor do others. China is not 
going to raise its taxes. In fact, these 
countries are continuing to do what 
they have been doing, which is to 
knock down barriers to jobs and invest-
ment in their economies, and that 
makes sense from their points of view. 
It makes sense from our point of view 
to continue to be competitive also. 
The tax increases would leave Amer-
ica standing alone atop the corporate 
tax rate chart. Studies by the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
and others have shown that, again, it is 
American workers who will bear the 
brunt of these corporate tax hikes in 
the form of lost jobs and lower wages. 
Because of the tax hikes, the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton 
model, in analyzing this Biden plan, ac-
tually projects that we will see a near-
ly 1-percent decrease in the GDP and a 
0.7-percent decrease in wages by 2031 
over current projections. Now, this is 
extraordinary to me because that is de-
spite the economic benefit—the obvi-
ous benefit—we are going to get from 
this infrastructure spending. So, de-
spite all of that benefit, we are still 
going to see a reduction in our econ-
omy, or economic growth, and a reduc-
tion in wages. This harms American 
workers, particularly those toward the 
bottom of the economic ladder. 
The bottom line is that the $2.1 tril-
lion tax hike used to pay for this infra-
structure bill will harm middle-class 
families and our businesses, and I be-
lieve the American people get that. 
They recognize that this is not the way 
forward for our economy or for our in-
frastructure. 
Instead, let’s follow the proven bipar-
tisan model on infrastructure. Let’s 
keep the plan to real infrastructure. 
Let’s agree to what it is. Let’s do it 
generously. Let’s include broadband. 
Let’s include water projects. Let’s 
make it real infrastructure, though. 
Then let’s come up with sensible pay- 
fors, including user fees. That is what 
the American people want, and that is 
what they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, legisla-
tion called the Judiciary Act of 2021 
was introduced last week that would 
immediately 
expand 
the 
Supreme 
Court to 13 Justices. 
If this is serious in its intent, it is 
foolish. There is no need to expand the 
Court in order to meet the demands of 
its workload. After the peaking in 2006, 
when President George W. Bush was in 
office, the number of cases on the dock-
et has now plummeted. 
In 2019, the late Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, a liberal icon appointed by 
President Clinton, told NPR that there 
is no need to expand the Court, saying: 
‘‘Nine seems to be a good number.’’ 
With that established, this is a trans-
parent ploy for power that would un-
dermine trust in the fair application of 
law and delegitimize the highest Court 
in the land. 
If this is really a serious policy piece 
of legislation, we certainly wouldn’t 
change the number of Supreme Court 
Justices immediately. If it weren’t just 
politics, we certainly wouldn’t change 
the Justices before another election. In 
fact, Senator Joe Biden, on this Senate 
floor, called FDR’s attempt to pack the 
Court ‘‘a power grab,’’ and as a Presi-
dential candidate this last year, he re-
fused to endorse expanding the number 
of Justices. 
Earlier this month, Justice Stephen 
Breyer, appointed by President Clin-
ton, said the Court’s authority depends 
on ‘‘a trust that the Court is guided by 
legal principles, not politics.’’ He con-
tinued by saying, ‘‘Structural alter-
ation motivated by the perception of

political influence can only feed that 
latter perception, further eroding that 
trust.’’ 
If the public sees any judge and Su-
preme Court Justices as politicians in 
robes, the public’s confidence in the 
courts and in the rule of law itself can 
only be diminished, diminishing the 
Court’s power, including its power to 
act as a check on other branches of 
government. 
Last August, Gallup found that 58 
percent of Americans approve of the 
job the Supreme Court is doing. In fact, 
the Supreme Court’s approval ratings 
have actually increased in the last sev-
eral years. Polling from February of 
this year finds that 35 percent of Amer-
icans approve of the job that we in 
Congress are doing, and that is up from 
15 percent not many days ago. 
I raise this data to demonstrate that 
the Supreme Court is an institution 
which a majority of Americans con-
tinues to place its trust in. That is a 
significant circumstance in today’s po-
larized world, but a majority of Ameri-
cans still believes it can trust the Su-
preme Court. If we in Congress inject 
ourselves into the size of the Court’s 
composition, Justice Breyer is exactly 
right, in that the trust the American 
people have that the rulings will be de-
livered on a fair reading of the law will 
be further undermined. 
On the Republican side of the aisle, 
we have seen our share of defeats in re-
cent years, and not once when the Re-
publican Party controlled Congress and 
had the White House were there efforts 
to expand the Supreme Court. Can you 
imagine how the left or the media 
would react if President Trump had at-
tempted to expand the Court to 13 Jus-
tices and add 4 Republican-nominated 
Justices during his tenure? 
We have not attempted to expand the 
Court because the Supreme Court 
should not serve as another legislative 
body. That is our job—a job we need to 
do much better than we do today so 
that more than one-third of the Amer-
ican people can place their confidence 
in us as we pass laws. 
We have had the same number of Su-
preme Court Justices for more than 150 
years. Perhaps the Judiciary Act of 
2021 is less an effort to expand the Su-
preme Court than it is an effort to in-
timidate sitting Justices to deliver rul-
ings favorable to the ideology of my 
colleagues who are proposing the legis-
lation. From guns to abortion, to reli-
gious liberties, to other hot-button 
issues, my colleagues are threatening 
the Justices either to deliver favorable 
rulings or to not take up divisive cases 
at all. If this is what my colleagues 
seek to accomplish, I am confident 
that the independence and integrity of 
our Justices will prevail. Indeed, this 
must prevail to preserve the American 
people’s confidence in the institution 
of the courts, in the judicial system, in 
the Supreme Court. 
I am disappointed because, rather 
than working with each other across 
the aisle—across this aisle right here— 
to pass legislation, the Democrats are 
more interested in pursuing a larger 
Supreme Court and more interested in 
eliminating the filibuster to pass their 
agenda—to stack the Court to prevent 
their legislation from being struck 
down as unconstitutional. 
Process matters around here. We 
have to get to the point at which we 
utilize the process to get a fair and just 
result, wherein all people’s voices are 
heard, wherein all Members of the Sen-
ate have the opportunity to express 
their views and have an opportunity 
for that to be voted on, but we don’t 
skew the process to get a desired out-
come. We all need to do our jobs to 
convince our colleagues that we are 
right in our positions, that our legisla-
tion is meritorious. We don’t and we 
shouldn’t change the process to get our 
way. 
The checks and balances of our Con-
stitution work. They have worked for a 
long time. They are important to this 
country. When we talk about how divi-
sive things are on the Senate floor and 
in this country today, the solution to 
that is not to change the rules in the 
middle of the game. It is to abide by 
the rules that protect our freedoms and 
liberties. 
I implore my colleagues to have the 
same faith in these constitutional 
guardrails as I do, to have the same 
faith in the independence and fairness 
of the Supreme Court that a majority 
of Americans has, and to believe that 
we can work together, that you and I 
can work together on behalf of the 
Americans we serve, the Americans we 
represent, without resorting to acts 
that will damage us all today and for 
generations to come.

TRIBUTE TO JOE GROSSMAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, my 
friend Joe Grossman has approached 
his work for the last 35 years with a 
head for numbers and a heart for peo-
ple. As an accountant turned CEO of 
the largest healthcare organization in 
Southeastern Kentucky, Joe’s experi-
enced leadership has helped improve 
the quality of life for hundreds of thou-
sands. This summer, Joe will close his 
chapter leading Appalachian Regional 
Healthcare, ARH, and a career of excel-
lence and accomplishment. As he be-
gins 
a 
well-deserved 
retirement, 
I 
would like to share my congratulations 
and gratitude for his many contribu-
tions to the Bluegrass. 
For nearly two decades, Joe has been 
entrusted with key financial and oper-
ational positions at ARH. At each step, 
he has helped the system expand and 
thrive. When the position opened, Joe 
was the obvious choice to take over as 
president and CEO. He pushed ARH to 
continue growing in service to its pa-
tients, employees, and communities. 
Today, the system operates 13 hos-
pitals in Kentucky and West Virginia 
as well as 80-plus clinic locations. With 
a team of more than 6,000 dedicated 
professionals, 
ARH 
serves 
nearly 
400,000 individuals across the region. 
The system’s extensive reach makes a 
transformative impact on rural Ken-
tucky communities every day and 
helps make the area a destination for 
top-tier medical talent. Joe’s leader-
ship even contributed to a national 
magazine naming ARH one of the Top 
10 Employers in Kentucky. 
Overseeing an organization of ARH’s 
size and importance would be a re-
markable feat in any year, but Joe ex-
ceeded expectations once again during 
the pandemic. Last month, I visited 
the ARH facility in Hazard to speak 
with Joe and his team about the roll-
out of the multiple safe and effective 
COVID–19 vaccines. At that time, three

of the five counties in Kentucky with 
the top vaccination rates were in 
ARH’s service area. I was proud to con-
gratulate 
Joe 
and 
his 
team 
of 
healthcare heroes who were getting 
shots in arms to beat this virus. 
Joe’s contributions to Kentucky ex-
tend beyond the hospital doors. He has 
gone to great lengths to personally 
partner 
with 
the 
communities 
he 
serves. His work with organizations 
like One East KY, the Hazard-Perry 
County Economic Development Alli-
ance, and One Harlan County has 
helped encourage new growth and op-
portunity. Joe developed a vision for a 
healthy and successful Kentucky, and 
he worked tirelessly over the years to 
bring it closer to reality. 
So, we are all going to miss working 
with Joe. But now he gets to spend 
more time on his most important roles, 
husband to Leigh, father, and grand-
father. Along with Joe’s colleagues and 
friends, I extend my best wishes for a 
fulfilling retirement. On behalf of the 
Senate, I would like to congratulate 
Joe on all of his success and thank him 
for his leadership in Kentucky. 
f 
NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT 
KAHL 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
here we are again, teeing up another 
discharge motion for another unquali-
fied Biden administration nominee. 
If there is one good thing I can say 
about Colin Kahl, the nominee for 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, 
it is that you never have to wonder 
where he stands on the issues. He is 
very consistent. 
Unfortunately, he has been consist-
ently wrong on some of the last dec-
ade’s most important foreign policy 
questions. 
In 2019, when disaster struck all 
along on our southern border, he la-
beled the situation ‘‘Trump’s fake bor-
der crisis’’ and ‘‘a phony terrorism 
threat.’’ That is a take that aged well, 
to be sure. 
His judgment calls on the actions and 
motivations of our most dangerous ad-
versaries have also been particularly 
terrible. 
When President Trump warned the 
Iranian regime not to resume their nu-
clear activities, Kahl declared that 
‘‘war drums’’ were already sounding. 
We know that wasn’t true. 
When President Trump made the de-
cision to eliminate terrorist leader 
Soleimani, Kahl was positive that the 
strike had started a war. It hadn’t. 
When I questioned Kahl during his con-
firmation hearings, he equated Iranian 
proxies killing Americans with our 
subsequent, 
proportionate 
strike 
against Solemani, saying, ‘‘There were 
provocations on both sides.’’ Indeed. 
Kahl was absolutely sure that given 
the chance, John Bolton, of all people, 
would twist available intelligence and 
singlehandedly start wars with Iran 
and North Korea. Another miss. 
He also predicted that Trump would 
jump into Syria and start a war with 
Assad and the Russians, which also 
didn’t happen. 
Those hot takes earned him a lot of 
ink in Foreign Policy magazine but not 
a lot of respect. I don’t know if he 
wrote those things because he wanted 
to put President Trump in the hot seat 
or because he honestly believed them, 
but I don’t think the answer to that 
question matters. 
If he believed them, then it is proof 
of his terrible judgment. 
If he wrote them to inflame the pro-
gressive base, it is proof he is willing to 
trivialize the prospect of armed con-
flict for clicks. 
How in the world can President Biden 
expect us to vote for that? 
In addition to his poor judgment, Mr. 
Kahl has also attached himself to truly 
terrible policy decisions. 
He opposed bipartisan legislation 
that would have imposed sanctions on 
the 
Islamic 
Revolutionary 
Guard 
Corps. 
He staffed the effort to condemn 
Israel at the United Nations Security 
Council. 
He is ‘‘open’’ to moving away from 
the nuclear triad. 
Perhaps worst of all, when he served 
in the Obama administration as Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
the Middle East, he dropped the ball on 
a status of forces agreement that 
would have allowed U.S. forces to re-
main in Iraq. 
That failure led to the rise of ISIS. 
I have examined Mr. Kahl’s record 
and found nothing but a history of bad 
policy judgment, a volatile disposition, 
and a terrible temper that manifests in 
inflammatory rhetoric. 
That might be a great resume for a 
pundit, but it is not the body of work 
I want to see from someone who will be 
responsible for developing national se-
curity and defense strategy. 
I oppose this discharge motion, I op-
pose this nomination, and I urge my 
colleagues to spend a few minutes with 
Mr. Kahl’s resume before placing him 
in such a powerful position at DOD.

250TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
VASSALBORO, MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise 
today to commemorate the 250th anni-
versary of the Town of Vassalboro, ME. 
Vassalboro was built with a spirit of 
determination and resiliency that still 
guides the community today, and this 
is a time to celebrate the generations 
of hard-working and caring people who 
have made it such a wonderful place to 
live, work, and raise families. 
The year of Vassalboro’s incorpora-
tion, 1771, was but one milestone in a 
long journey of progress. For thou-
sands of years, the land along the great 
Kennebec River was the home of the 
Abenaki Tribe, who hunted, fished, and 
tilled the fertile soil. The reverence the 
Abenaki had for the natural beauty 
and resources of the region is upheld by 
the people of Vassalboro today. 
Vassalboro’s roots run deep into 
American history. It originally was 
part of the lands granted to the Pil-
grims of the Plymouth Colony in the 
1600s. Later, the town became home to 
a large settlement of Quakers and a 
center of the movement to abolish 
slavery. The Society of Friends con-
tinues to have a positive presence in 
the town today. The statue of the 
Union 
soldier 
in 
Monument 
Park 
stands in silent tribute to the many pa-
triots who have stepped forward to 
serve the cause of freedom. 
With the mighty Kennebec River pro-
viding power, Vassalboro was home to 
many lumber, grain, and textile mills. 
Built in 1850, the Olde Mill on Main 
Street was one of the largest mills in 
New England and world famous for the 
quality of the cashmere it produced. 
The wealth produced by hard work and 
determination was invested in schools 
and churches to create a true commu-
nity. 
Today, visitors and residents alike 
enjoy Vassalboro’s quiet parks, beau-
tiful historic buildings, and exciting 
outdoor recreation opportunities. The 
energy and planning that are going 
into the town’s 250th anniversary cele-
bration demonstrate the pride towns-
people have in their town. 
Mr. President, Vassalboro’s 250th an-
niversary is not merely about the pass-
ing of time, it is about human accom-
plishment. We celebrate the people 
who, for longer than America has been 
a nation, have pulled together, cared 
for one another, and built a great com-
munity. Thanks to those who came be-
fore, Vassalboro, ME, has a wonderful 
history. Thanks to those there today, 
it has a bright future.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. WARNOCK, Ms. SMITH, Mr. 
SANDERS, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
MARKEY, 
Mr. 
WYDEN, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, and Ms. STABENOW): 
S. 1271. A bill to reauthorize the 
Clean School Bus Program, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Clean Com-
mute for Kids Act,’’ which I introduced 
today. 
I know firsthand how outdated diesel 
school buses expose our children to 
harmful and unnecessary pollution. I 
grew up in the San Fernando Valley 
and for many years, I rode a bus to 
school. I can still smell the diesel ex-
haust that my classmates and I would 
breathe in on our way to and from 
school. 
Before the COVID–19 pandemic, near-
ly 25 million American children were 
exposed to this same diesel exhaust 
when they ride over 500,000 predomi-
nantly diesel buses to school nation-
wide. This pollution not only harms 
our children’s health, but it also im-
pacts student achievement. Studies 
show that transitioning to cleaner bus 
fleets can spur both health and aca-
demic improvements. 
As we work to build back better and 
combat climate change, we must help 
school districts accelerate the deploy-
ment of zero-emission buses to reduce 
the exposure of our children to pollut-
ants and cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this 
bill 
together 
with 
Senator 
WARNOCK to authorize $25 billion for a 
new grant program to help school dis-
tricts 
replace 
existing 
buses 
with 
clean, zero-emission buses. 
This funding represents an essential 
aspect of building more equitable, sus-
tainable transportation infrastructure, 
and it represents an investment in our 
children, our environment, and our fu-
ture. 
This legislation recognizes the dis-
proportionate impact this pollution 
has on underserved populations by set-
ting aside 40 percent of the grant fund-
ing for replacing school buses serving 
environmental justice communities. 
Some of California’s school districts 
have already begun the transition to 
zero-emission buses. The California Air 
Resources Board has leveraged federal 
funding to assist school districts and 
local air boards with the costs of 
school bus replacements. This bill will 
accelerate this transition and provide 
funding to reach more schools in Cali-
fornia and across the nation. 
I want to thank Senator WARNOCK for 
co-leading this bill with me, and I hope 
our colleagues will join us in support of 
this bill that would transform our na-
tion’s school bus fleet, protect air qual-
ity, 
and 
improve 
the 
health 
and 
wellbeing of our children. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Mr. BROWN): 
S. 1274. A bill to limit the authority 
of States or other taxing jurisdictions 
to tax certain income of employees for 
employment duties performed in other 
States or taxing jurisdictions, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

ATION OF EMPLOYEE INCOME. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No part of the wages or 
other remuneration earned by an employee 
who is a resident of a taxing jurisdiction and 
performs employment duties in more than 
one taxing jurisdiction shall be subject to in-
come tax in any taxing jurisdiction other

(1) the taxing jurisdiction of the employ-
ee’s residence; and 
(2) any taxing jurisdiction within which 
the employee is present and performing em-
ployment duties for more than 30 days dur-
ing the calendar year in which the wages or 
other remuneration is earned. 
(b) INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING AND REPORT-
ING.—Wages or other remuneration earned in 
any calendar year shall not be subject to in-
come tax withholding and reporting require-
ments with respect to any taxing jurisdic-

income tax withholding and reporting re-
quirements with respect to any taxing juris-
diction— 
(1) an employer may rely on an employee’s

form such duties absent— 
(A) the employer’s actual knowledge of 
fraud by the employee in making the deter-
mination; or

employee to evade tax; 
(2) except as provided in paragraph (3), if

preclude an employer’s ability to rely on an 
employee’s determination under paragraph 
(1); and 
(3) notwithstanding paragraph (2), if an 
employer, at its sole discretion, maintains a 
time and attendance system that tracks 
where the employee performs duties on a 
daily basis, data from the time and attend-
ance system shall be used instead of the em-
ployee’s determination under paragraph (1). 
(d) DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES.—For 
purposes of this Act: 
(1) DAY.— 
(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), 
an employee is considered present and per-
forming employment duties within a taxing 
jurisdiction for a day if the employee per-
forms more of the employee’s employment 
duties within such taxing jurisdiction than 
in any other taxing jurisdiction during a 
day. 
(B) If an employee performs employment 
duties in a resident taxing jurisdiction and 
in only one nonresident taxing jurisdiction 
during one day, such employee shall be con-
sidered to have performed more of the em-
ployee’s employment duties in the non-
resident taxing jurisdiction than in the resi-
dent taxing jurisdiction for such day. 
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the por-
tion of the day during which the employee is 
in transit shall not be considered in deter-
mining the location of an employee’s per-
formance of employment duties. 
(2) EMPLOYEE.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—

DEFINITION.—Except as pro-
vided in clause (ii), the term ‘‘employee’’ has

risdiction in which the person’s employment 
duties are performed, in which case the tax-
ing jurisdiction’s definition shall prevail.

tirement, including the shift away 
from employer-based ‘‘defined benefit’’ 
plans and rising health care and long- 
term care costs. Longer life spans in-
crease the risk of outliving retirement 
savings. The economic and health im-
pacts of the COVID–19 crisis may also 
pose a threat to retirement security. 
Increasing access to employer-spon-
sored retirement plans is one way to 
help improve the financial security of 
many Americans. According to the 
Georgetown University Center for Re-
tirement Initiatives, nationwide only 
about 54 percent of private sector 
workers had access to a retirement 
plan through their employer in 2020. In 
Maine, the percentage is a bit higher; 
approximately 59 percent of private 
sector employees had access to a re-
tirement plan at work. But that still 
leaves more than 200,000 employees 
without access to a plan. 
In December 2019, provisions from my 
bipartisan Retirement Security Act 
were signed into law as part of the Set-
ting Every Community Up for Retire-
ment Enhancement or ‘‘SECURE’’ Act. 
These provisions will help to expand 
access to employer-provided retire-
ment plans by reducing their cost and 
complexity, especially for small busi-
nesses. This law represents an impor-
tant step forward, but more is needed. 
Congress established SIMPLE (Sav-
ings Incentive Match Plan for Employ-
ees) retirement plans in 1996 to encour-
age small businesses to provide their 
employees 
with 
retirement 
plans. 
These plans are less costly and easier 
to navigate than traditional 401(k) 
plans and provide an alternative ap-
proach for employers to help their em-
ployees save for retirement. 
The SIMPLE Plan Modernization 
Act, which I am introducing today 
with my colleague, Senator MARK WAR-
NER, would provide greater flexibility 
and access to employees and employers 
seeking to save for retirement by using 
SIMPLE plans. 
This legislation would expand access 
to SIMPLE plans by increasing the 
contribution limit for most small busi-
nesses. In addition, the bill includes in-
centives to encourage small businesses 
to move from a SIMPLE plan to a 
401(k) plan when they are able to make 
this change. 
Like many Americans, spouses of ac-
tive duty service members often face 
challenges when it comes to saving for 
retirement. Military spouses also face 
one hurdle that many others do not: 
frequent moves and changes in employ-
ment. 
According to the Department of De-
fense, about one-third of military serv-
ice members experience a permanent 
change of station move every year. 
When a service member moves, their 
spouse usually relocates with them. 
The military spouse may face periods 
of unemployment, where they are not 
able to participate in an employer- 
sponsored retirement plan. When they 
do find a new job, they often work 
part-time, despite seeking full-time 
work, or are only able to spend a few 
years with their employer before mov-
ing again. These factors often preclude 
them from being eligible to receive em-
ployer contributions to their retire-
ment plan or from being fully vested in 
their plan. 
The second bill I am introducing 
today focuses on helping to address 
this need by providing a tax credit to 
small employers who provide military 
spouses with accelerated eligibility for 
retirement 
plan 
participation, 
em-
ployer contributions, and vesting. 
In particular, the Military Spouses 
Retirement Security Act, which I am 
introducing with my colleague Senator 
MAGGIE HASSAN, would make small em-
ployers—those with up to 100 employ-
ees—eligible for a tax credit of up to 
$500 per year per military spouse. The 
credit would be available for three 
years per military spouse. The amount 
of the credit would be equal to $200 per 
military spouse, plus 100 percent of all 
employer 
contributions 
for 
that 
spouse, up to $300. 
To receive the tax credit, small em-
ployers must make a military spouse 
immediately eligible for retirement 
plan participation within two months 
of hire. Upon plan eligibility, a mili-
tary spouse must be eligible for any 
matching or non-elective contribution 
available to a similarly situated em-
ployee with at least two years of serv-
ice, and must be 100 percent imme-
diately vested in all employer con-
tributions. 
In light of the positive effects these 
bills would have on strengthening re-
tirement security for millions of Amer-
icans, I urge my colleagues to support 
the SIMPLE Plan Modernization Act 
and the Military Spouses Retirement 
Security Act. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. PORTMAN):

BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. CRAPO, 
Ms.

Mr. 
MARKEY, 
Mr. 
RUBIO, and Mr. CORNYN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 167 
Whereas thousands of children in the 
United States have been abducted from the 
United States by parents, separating those 
children from their parents who remain in 
the United States; 
Whereas it is illegal under section 1204 of 
title 18, United States Code, to remove, or 
attempt to remove, a child from the United 
States or to retain a child (who has been in 
the United States) outside of the United 
States with the intent to obstruct the lawful 
exercise of parental rights; 
Whereas 10,836 children were reported ab-
ducted from the United States between 2009 
and 2019; 
Whereas, during 2019, 1 or more cases of 
international parental child abduction in-
volving children who are citizens of the 
United States were identified in 102 coun-
tries around the world; 
Whereas the United States is a party to the 
Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inter-
national Child Abduction, done at The 
Hague, October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Hague Conven-
tion on Abduction’’), which— 
(1) supports the prompt return of wrongly 
removed or retained children; and 
(2) calls for all participating parties to re-
spect parental custody rights; 
Whereas the majority of children who were 
abducted from the United States have yet to 
be reunited with their custodial parents; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2019, Argentina, 
the Bahamas, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa 
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, 
Romania, Tunisia, and the United Arab 
Emirates were identified under the Sean and 
David Goldman International Child Abduc-
tion Prevention and Return Act of 2014 (22 
U.S.C. 9101 et seq.) as engaging in a pattern 
of noncompliance (as defined in section 3 of 
such Act (22 U.S.C. 9101)); 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States has recognized that family abduc-
tion— 
(1) is a form of child abuse with potentially 
‘‘devastating consequences for a child’’, 
which may include negative impacts on the 
physical and mental well-being of the child; 
and 
(2) may cause a child to ‘‘experience a loss 
of community and stability, leading to lone-
liness, anger, and fear of abandonment’’; 
Whereas, according to the 2010 Report on 
Compliance with the Hague Convention on 
the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-
duction by the Department of State, an ab-
ducted child is at risk of significant short- 
and long-term problems, including ‘‘anxiety, 
eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, 
sleep disturbances, [and] aggressive behav-
ior’’; 
Whereas international parental child ab-
duction has devastating emotional con-
sequences for the child and for the parent 
from whom the child is separated; 
Whereas the United States has a history of 
promoting child welfare through institutions 
including— 
(1) in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the Children’s Bureau of 
the Administration for Children and Fami-
lies; and 
(2) in the Department of State, the Office 
of Children’s Issues of the Bureau of Con-
sular Affairs; 
Whereas 
the 
Coalition 
to 
End 
Inter-
national Parental Child Abduction, through 
dedicated advocacy and regular testimony, 
has highlighted the importance of this issue 
to Congress and called on successive admin-
istrations to take concerted action to stop 
international parental child abduction and 
repatriate kidnapped United States children; 
Whereas Congress has signaled a commit-
ment to ending international parental child 
abduction by enacting— 
(1) the International Child Abduction Rem-
edies Act (22 U.S.C. 9001 et seq.); 
(2) the International Parental Kidnapping 
Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–173), which 
enacted section 1204 of title 18, United States 
Code; and 
(3) the Sean and David Goldman Inter-
national Child Abduction Prevention and Re-
turn Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et seq.);

April 21, 2021 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 543, 112th Congress, agreed to on De-
cember 4, 2012, condemning the international 
abduction of children; 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-

19, 2018, to raise awareness of, and opposition 
to, international parental child abduction; 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 23, 116th Congress, agreed to on April 
11, 2019, to raise awareness of the harm 
caused by international parental child ab-

Whereas Congress calls upon the Depart-
ment of State to fully utilize the tools avail-
able under the Sean and David Goldman 
International Child Abduction Prevention 
and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et seq.) 
to negotiate, and make publicly available, 
bilateral agreements or memorandums of un-

(1) with countries not party to the Hague 
Convention on Abduction to resolve abduc-
tion and access cases; and 
(2) regarding open abduction and access 
cases predating the Hague Convention on Ab-
duction with countries that have thereafter 
become a party to the Hague Convention on 
Abduction; 
Whereas all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia have enacted laws criminalizing 
parental kidnapping; 
Whereas, in 2019, the Prevention Branch of 
the Office of Children’s Issues of the Depart-
ment of State— 
(1) fielded more than 5,400 inquiries from 
the general public relating to preventing a 
child from being removed from the United 
States; and 
(2) enrolled more than 4,500 children in the 
Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program, 
which— 
(A) is one of the most important tools of 
the Department of State for preventing 
international parental child abduction; and 
(B) allows the Office of Children’s Issues to 
contact the enrolling parent or legal guard-
ian to verify whether the parental consent 
requirement has been met when a passport 
application has been submitted for an en-
rolled child; 
Whereas the Department of State cannot 
track the ultimate destination of a child 
through the use of the passport issued by the 
Department of State if the child is trans-
ported to a third country after departing 
from the United States; 
Whereas a child who is a citizen of the 
United States may have another nationality 
and may travel using a passport issued by 
another country, which— 
(1) increases the difficulty of determining 
the whereabouts of the child; and 
(2) makes efforts to prevent abduction 
more critical; 
Whereas, during 2019, 220 children were re-
turned to the United States, and an addi-
tional 118 cases were resolved in other ways; 
and 
Whereas, in 2019, the Department of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the Pre-
vention Branch of the Office of Children’s 
Issues of the Department of State, enrolled 
363 children in the Prevent Abduction Pro-
gram, which is aimed at preventing inter-
national parental child abduction through 
coordination with the U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Patrol officers at the airport, seaport, or 
land border ports of entry (POE) on inter-
cepting the child before departure: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and observes ‘‘Countering 
International

Child 
Abduction 
Month’’ during the period beginning on April 
1, 2021, and ending on April 30, 2021, to raise

(2) urges the United States to continue 
playing a leadership role in raising aware-
ness about the devastating impacts of inter-
national parental child abduction by edu-
cating the public about the negative emo-
tional, psychological, and physical con-
sequences to children and parents victimized 
by international parental child abduction.

retary of Health and Human Services, in co-
ordination with the COVID–19 Health Equity

tions, shall issue guidance on how to report

SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes.

SA 1458. Mrs. BLACKBURN sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed to amendment SA 1445 pro-
posed by Mr. SCHUMER (for Ms. HIRONO 
(for 
herself, 
Ms. 
COLLINS, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, and Mr. WARNOCK)) to the 
bill S. 937, to facilitate the expedited 
review of COVID–19 hate crimes, and 
for other purposes; which was ordered 
to lie on the table; as follows: 
Beginning on page 4, strike line 11 and all 
that follows through page 21, line 19 and in-
sert the following: 
(1) establish online reporting of hate

SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or

(B) PRIORITY.—In making grants under 
subparagraph (A), the Attorney General 
shall give priority to States and units of 
local government that develop and imple-
ment the programs and activities described 
in subsection (e)(2)(A). 
(2) REPORTING.— 
(A) COMPLIANCE.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
clause (ii), in each fiscal year beginning after 
the date that is 3 years after the date on

NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, in-
tend to object to proceeding to the 
nomination of Samantha Power, of 
Massachusetts, to be Administrator of 
the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, dated April 21, 
2021. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of Samantha Power to be director 
of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) (PN 
114). 
Throughout the 116th Congress, I 
conducted an investigation that found 
that a non-profit organization trans-
ferred funds to an entity known as the 
Islamic Relief Agency (ISRA). This en-
tity had been sanctioned by the Treas-
ury Department for helping funnel 
funds to terrorists and terrorist organi-
zations including Osama Bin Laden. 
During this investigation we came 
across 
redacted

April 21, 2021 
Ambassador to the United Nations, 
Samantha Power worked through back 
channels to trigger a Treasury review 
of ISRA’s sanctioned status in an effort 
to have them delisted. 
In an effort to have these emails un- 
redacted and better understand Ms. 
Power’s involvement in what could be 
an alarming abuse of power, I sent a 
letter to Ms. Power and USAID re-
questing information on February 18, 
2021. Ms. Power responded to my letter 
on March 23, 2021, the date of her com-
mittee hearing, but failed to answer 
the questions or provide the un-re-
dacted versions of these emails. On 
March 31, 2021, I sent a second letter to 
Ms. Power urging her to fully respond 
to my initial letter. I have yet to re-
ceive a response. 
Unfortunately, due to Ms. Power’s 
lack of transparency, I must object to 
any consideration of this nomination. I 
cannot in good conscience vote for Ms. 
Power until I have received a full re-
sponse to the questions posed in my 
letter, 
reviewed 
the 
un-redacted 
versions of these emails, and confirmed 
that she did not attempt to utilize her 
office to delist ISRA through back 
channels.

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MORNINGSIDE ASSOCIATION 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to join the 
families of the Morningside community and the 
City of Milford in marking the 100th Anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Morningside 
Association—a very special milestone for this 
unique organization. Chartered by the Con-
necticut 
state 
legislature 
in 
1921, 
the 
Morningside Association created a tight-knit, 
welcoming community where families have 
flourished for generations. 
Nestled along the shores of Long Island 
Sound, the Morningside property has had a 
rich history. The parcel was included in the 
original land purchase from the Paugusset 
Tribe and for the first several hundred years 
was known as ‘‘Merwin’s Farm’’ at Pond Point 
and was both a working farm and home to six-
teen generations of the Merwin family. In the 
mid-1860’s, the land was purchased by New 
England industrialist Henry G. Thompson. Mr. 
Thompson built a manor house of twenty-two 
rooms, surrounded by wide expanses of lawn, 
rare, beautiful trees and elaborate flower gar-
dens. The ‘‘Morningside’’ moniker was quickly 
given to his new home by Mr. Thompson be-
cause it faced the rising sun. In 1912 the 
property was offered for sale. Specialists in 
developing small residential communities, the 
owners of the Yale Land Company, Milton T. 
Yale and two sons, Fred and Will, recognized 
an ideal opportunity for a shorefront develop-
ment. After dividing the land into building lots, 
they laid out and constructed Morningside 
Drive on the shore front and Ridgewood Drive 
bordering the woodland, with nine roads run-
ning due west to connect these drives and 
provide settings for homes. 
By 1921 the majority of the lots had been 
sold and the Yale Land Company had gradu-
ally withdrawn its policy of active maintenance. 
It was then that the Morningside property own-
ers decided to form an association and seek 
a charter from the state which would enable 
them to preserve the unique character of the 
Morningside neighborhood. They successfully 
lobbied the state legislature for the charter, 
designating the community as an improvement 
district. Over the course of the last century the 
Morningside Association has guided the com-
munity through a multitude of challenges in-
cluding the transition from a summer to year- 
round residential community, the installation of 
a private storm drain and sewer line system, 
and the expansion of the community’s bor-
ders. The Association has also worked closely 
with the City of Milford, particularly with the in-
stallation and maintenance of the Morningside 
revetment—a granite wall made necessary 
due to the damage and erosion caused by 
hurricanes that hit the area in the early half of 
the 20th century. 
Beyond the physical maintenance of the 
property, the Association is also responsible 
for the special sense of community that is 
Morningside. From the annual July 4th cele-
bration to the shared enjoyment of the water 
and nature, the Association makes every effort 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
families 
who 
call 
Morningside home are proud to do so. I am 
honored to have this opportunity to extend my 
thanks and appreciation to the members of the 
Morningside Association, past and present, 
who have and continue to work so diligently to 
create and enrich such a vibrant community. 
My heartfelt congratulations to them as they 
mark their centennial anniversary. As we say 
in Italian—C’ent Anni—to another hundred 
years.

IN HONOR OF THE SERVICE OF 
COMMAND 
SERGEANT 
MAJOR 
WILLIAM RUSSELL III 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Command Sergeant Major 
William Russell III, the outgoing Brigade Com-
mand Sergeant Major of the 177th Military Po-
lice Brigade. His service to our community and 
to our Nation are worthy of commendation. 
Born in Madison Heights, Michigan, he en-
listed in the United States Army on May 16, 
1989. During his time on active duty, he 
served Wheeled Vehicle Operator for ten 
years. After serving his duty, Command Ser-
geant Major Russell’s service to our country 
was not yet done. He enlisted in the Michigan 
Army National Guard immediately after serving 
on active duty, serving with the 210th Military 
Police Company as a Section Sergeant. 
His previous assignments with the Michigan 
Army National Guard include, Platoon Ser-
geant 1461st CBT HET Company, First Ser-
geant 1072nd Maintenance Company, Com-
mand 
Sergeant 
Major 
1225th 
Combat 
Sustainment Support Battalion, Command 
Sergeant Major 272nd Regional Support 
Group, 
Command 
Sergeant 
Major/Com-
mandant 177th Regional Training Institute, 
Command Sergeant Major 177th Military Po-
lice Brigade, State Command Sergeant Major 
and Senior Enlisted Advisor of the Michigan 
National Guard. He has earned many awards 
for his exemplary service, including the Bronze 
Star and the Meritorious Service Medal. 
In the numerous roles that he has served 
and a military career that has spanned dec-
ades, Command Sergeant Major Russell has 
proven his tremendous commitment and dedi-
cation to service. A tried and true leader, he 
heard the call and has served this entire Na-
tion well. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Command Sergeant Major Wil-
liam Russell III for his lifetime of invaluable 
service to this Nation. I join with Command 
Sergeant Major Russell’s family—including his 
children DeSeandra, Alfonzo, and William— 
friends, and colleagues in extending my grati-
tude to him for his exemplary and honorable 
service to this country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
LEE DICKINSON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life John Lee 
Dickinson of Mantachie, Mississippi who 
passed away on January 7, 2021 I at North 
Mississippi Medical Center. I join countless 
friends, family, and loved ones in mourning his 
loss. 
Born February 4, 1947 in Marietta, Mis-
sissippi to Fisher and Jewel Lindsey Dickin-
son, John Lee grew to be a star athlete. He 
graduated from Mantachie High School and 
married his sweetheart Joyce Ann Franks in 
1966. For 40 years he worked at the 
Tombigbee Electric Power Association and re-
tired as the Fulton Branch Manager in 2009. 
He served in the United States Army National 
Guard, where he was awarded sharpshooter 
medals and other honors. He passed on his 
love of athletics, hunting, fishing and farming 
to his four children. 
John Lee was an athlete and a scholar. He 
deeply enjoyed literature and poetry and was 
a gifted painter. He played four instruments 
and taught himself Spanish. John Lee was a 
dedicated grandfather, spending hours at the 
pool with his family and beloved dogs, Luke 
and Mandy. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife of 
54 years, Joyce Ann Franks Dickinson; chil-
dren Chris, Angie, Brian, and Jason; best 
friend, Barry; and many grandchildren. 
John Lee Dickinson was a great man dedi-
cated to family, faith, and country. He will be 
greatly missed by all who knew him.

Fours, including winning seven state cham-
pionships, and each has had 38 All-State se-
lections. St. Elizabeth’s softball program has 
won four state titles (1992, 1994, 2002, 2011), 
finished as a runner-up in 1993 and 1997, and 
was fourth in 1991. St. Elizabeth’s baseball 
program has captured three state champion-
ships (1995, 1997, 2019) and was runner-up 
in 2018. The Hornets also placed third in 1996 
while their 1984, 2010 and 2011 teams each 
placed fourth in the state. 
As a native of St. Elizabeth this honor is es-
pecially personal for me. I graduated from St. 
Elizabeth but more importantly, my wife Jackie 
and I have watched generations of kids grow 
into young adults and go on to become excep-
tional members of our community and commu-
nities around Missouri. Both of our daughters 
played on the softball team and our son 
played on the baseball team where they and 
their teammates learned invaluable life les-
sons about hard work, commitment, and team-
work. 
Thanks to the coaches, teachers, and ad-
ministrators we have been lucky enough to 
have over the years, our little town has experi-
enced success well beyond the ball field. This 
honor is certainly a testament to all of the kids 
who worked so hard to achieve athletic suc-
cess but also to the parents and a community 
that 
supports 
one 
another 
and 
always 
prioritized our future generations. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating the St. Elizabeth High School Soft-
ball and Baseball Programs on multiple ex-
traordinary seasons and their much-deserved 
Hall of Fame induction.

participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Ryan has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Ryan 
has held the positions of Patrol Leader, Quar-
termaster and Senior Patrol Leader for his 
troop. He is a member of both Mic-o-say 
Tribes, where he is a Hardaway Warrior at 
Camp Geiger and a Brave at Bartle. Ryan has 
also contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. Ryan’s Eagle project was 
renovating the Community of Christ Church 
flag plaza at Camp Farwesta campgrounds in 
Stewartsville, MO. He removed the single flag-
pole and replaced it with three new flagpoles, 
installed a border and added pea gravel. The 
added flagpoles allow flags to be flown that 
represent the different organizations that use 
the campgrounds. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Ryan William Magee for 
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7). 
I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation 
which seeks to end the wage gap once and 
for all. Women in America, especially women 
of color, make far less than their male coun-
terparts. While we have made progress clos-
ing this gap in recent years, this past year has 
the potential to set this movement back by 
decades. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has disproportion-
ately affected women. Unstable childcare and 
disruptions to school schedules have forced 
millions of mothers to leave the workforce. Ad-
ditionally, 
women 
disproportionately 
work 
lower wage hourly jobs that have been 
slashed across the country due to store clos-
ings and other pandemic-related restrictions. 
This has resulted in women suffering the ma-
jority of pandemic-related job losses. Women 
also hold a greater share of frontline essential 
jobs that have faced greater risks of exposure 
such as nurses, teachers, home health care 
providers, 
flight 
attendants, 
transportation 
workers, grocery store clerks, childcare pro-
viders, and countless other positions. Simply 
put, we are getting through this pandemic and 
are on the brink of beating COVID–19 be-
cause of the tireless work of American 
women—and they deserve tangible support. 
On Equal Pay Day earlier this year, I led a 
joint statement with Congresswoman GRACE 
MENG, 
Congresswoman 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL- 
ALLARD, Congresswoman BRENDA LAWRENCE, 
and 32 other Democratic women in Congress 
highlighting 
the 
disproportionate 
effect 
COVID–19 has had on women and calling for 
structured relief. Therefore, I would like to in-
clude in the RECORD that statement. 
Again, I rise in strong support of the Pay-
check Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and I urge my col-
leagues to pass this important legislation. 
MARCH 24, 2021. 
Today is Equal Pay Day, the day in 2021 
where women’s earnings finally caught up to 
what men earned in 2020. While strides had 
been made to close this earnings gap, this 
past year has the potential of erasing years 
of progress because of the disproportionate 
impact the COVID–19 pandemic has had on 
women. 
The pandemic has dealt an unprecedented 
blow to every aspect of American society, 
taking more than half a million lives and 
costing our economy trillions of dollars. Our 
nation is facing multiple crises: the COVID– 
19 
virus, 
economic 
uncertainty, 
and 
a 
caregiving shortage. As such, while the pan-
demic has caused virtually every American 
to struggle in some fashion, the brunt of this 
disaster has been felt by women—especially 
women of color. 
Due to unstable child care and disruptions 
to school schedules, millions of mothers 
have been forced to leave the workforce to 
care for a child. Roughly 10 million working 
mothers have a child age 6 or younger, and 
many of these women have been forced to 
leave their jobs to care for their children. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, 865,000 women left the labor force in 
September 2020 alone—more than four times 
the number of men who left the labor force 
that month. 
Women are being forced out of the work-
force for other reasons as well. Women dis-
proportionately work lower wage hourly jobs 
that have been slashed across the country 
due to store closings and other pandemic-re-
lated restrictions. This has resulted in 
women suffering the majority of pandemic- 
related job losses, totaling more than 5.4 
million net jobs, or 55 percent of the overall 
net job loss since the start of the crisis. This 
is especially true for Black, Latina, Asian 
American and Pacific Islander, and Native 
American women who are significantly more 
likely to work hourly jobs that have either 
been eliminated or have had their hours 
greatly reduced over the last year. 
Even women who have maintained their 
job during this crisis have disproportionately 
been affected. Women hold a greater share of 
frontline essential jobs that have faced 
greater risks of exposure, such as nurses, 
teachers, home health care providers, flight 
attendants, transportation workers, grocery 
store clerks, child care providers, and count-
less other positions. Simply put, we are get-
ting through this pandemic and are on the 
brink of beating COVID–19 because of the 
tireless work of American women—and they 
deserve tangible support. 
While we are encouraged by the passage of 
the American Rescue Plan and strongly sup-
port the provisions that help protect work-
ing women, we also encourage our colleagues 
to consider this package as a down payment. 
We need transformational structural change 
to fight against the economic, financial, gen-
der, and racial injustices. We need massive 
investments in our child care infrastructure, 
including universal child care and early 
learning, $15 minimum wage, and paid leave 
programs; without these, women will be set 
back a generation by this pandemic. 
For decades, women have unionized and 
joined forces to fight for fair hiring prac-
tices, workplace protections, and our ongo-
ing fight for equal pay. We simply cannot 
turn this clock back and we must continue 
to protect our right to organize and in doing 
so, fight to narrow the income gap. It will 
take all of us to dedicate the needed energy 
and resources to ensure that our daughters 
and granddaughters do not need to acknowl-
edge Equal Pay Day in future years to come.

the Kremlin’s brutal treatment of Russian op-
position leader Alexei Navalny. 
I am thankful to Congressman BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK for co-leading this resolution with 
me. I am also thankful to Chairman MEEKS, 
Europe Subcommittee Chairman KEATING, 
Ranking 
Member 
MCCAUL, 
Congressman 
QUIGLEY, Congressman PFLUGER, and Con-
gressman MEIER for their leadership, support, 
and original cosponsorship on this measure. 
Mr. Navalny has been a leader in uncover-
ing gross corruption at the highest levels of 
the Kremlin that sustain that country’s brutal 
regime. Through new forms of social media, 
his ability to reach out to and organize Rus-
sian citizens has been admirable. 
Tragically on August 20, 2020, Vladimir 
Putin’s thugs poisoned Mr. Navalny with the 
nerve agent, Novichok that nearly ended his 
life. 
After making a recovery in Germany, Mr. 
Navalny bravely returned to Russia where he 
was detained and transferred to a modem-day 
gulag where he faced torture. 
To protest these despicable conditions, he 
has been on a hunger strike for close to three 
weeks, and is now in critical condition. 
Russia has a deeply disturbing history of vi-
olence and assassinations to silence dis-
sidents like Boris Nemtsov, Sergei Magnitsky, 
Alexander Litvinenko and many more. 
In response, this resolution strongly con-
demns the Kremlin’s gross mistreatment of Mr. 
Navalny, calls for him to receive adequate 
medical care, and urges the Biden Administra-
tion to take all appropriate actions to secure 
his release, including through increased sanc-
tions. 
Additionally, the resolution expresses grati-
tude for the critical work of Radio Free Eu-
rope/Radio Liberty in shining a light on these 
issues, and urges the State Department to 
take greater action to protect the broadcaster’s 
physical presence in Moscow in face of the 
Kremlin’s disturbing attacks on it. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this leg-
islation.

INTRODUCTION OF THE REBUILD-
ING AMERICA’S AIRPORT INFRA-
STRUCTURE ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Rebuilding America’s Airport 
Infrastructure Act of 2021. This legislation 
makes a long-overdue update to the Pas-
senger Facility Charge (PFC) by increasing 
the maximum-allowable PFC by just $1.00/ 
year, starting in 2023, for four years and then 
indexes the fee to inflation every year there-
after. This increase to $8.50 by 2026 would 
restore the value of the PFC to when it was 
last increased in 2000. 
Airports are an essential part of American 
infrastructure and economic competitiveness, 
supporting $1.4 trillion in annual economic out-
put and 11.5 million jobs. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has devastated airports’ finances with a 
combination of lower passenger levels and a 
higher demand for health infrastructure im-
provements to keep the flying public safe. 
These challenges come on top of a 5-year 
$115 billion infrastructure backlog that is a re-
sult of the federal government’s failure to mod-
ernize one of the main funding mechanisms 
for airports: the PFC. 
The PFC a locally imposed, per-passenger 
user fee that improves capacity and allows for 
airport updates, reduces noise, or increases 
competition among airlines. PFC revenues 
complement grants from the Airport Improve-
ment 
Program 
(AIP) 
for 
eligible 
capital 
projects. But under current law, the maximum 
PFC amount airports can collect is capped at 
$4.50 per passenger per flight segment. Con-
gress last adjusted the PFC to $4.50 in 2000, 
but with inflation and the rising cost of con-
struction the purchasing power of the PFC has 
declined 40 percent. As a result, many aging 
airports have reached their debt capacity and 
either cannot finance new projects or have 
had to stretch them over a longer timeframe, 
increasing the costs and delaying the benefits 
for passengers. 
Modernizing the PFC would raise tens of bil-
lions of dollars for airport infrastructure im-
provements while requiring zero taxpayer dol-
lars, not increasing the national debt, and add-
ing billions of dollars to U.S. Gross Domestic 
Product. The Rebuilding America’s Airport In-
frastructure Act will ensure that airports are 
safe, economically competitive, and the envy 
of the world.

REMEMBERING JAMES L. 
NEWBROUGH, SR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of James L. Newbrough, Sr., of 
Niles, Ohio, who passed away on Sunday, 
April 11, 2021 at the age of 83. 
Mr. Newbrough was born February 17, 1938 
in Brownsville, Pennsylvania the son of Lester 
and Mabel Clemmer Newbrough. He was a 
1956 graduate of Centerville High School and 
was employed as a field engineer and tool re-
pairman at Republic Steel in Warren for 30 
years, retiring in 1986. 
Jim was a member of First United Methodist 
Church in Niles, ITAM No. 39 in Girard, Sin-
cerity Masonic Lodge in Niles, and member 
and past president of the Niles Men’s Demo-
cratic Club. He was an avid Pittsburgh Steeler 
fan, enjoyed golfing, bowling, bocce, working 
on his lawn, spending time with his grand-
children, and was a United States Army Vet-
eran. 
Mr. Newbrough will be deeply missed by his 
wife Jenny Crockett Newbrough whom he 
married June 14, 1958, four sons, James L. 
Newbrough Jr. and his wife Becky of Niles, 
Mark A. Newbrough of Mineral Ridge, Gary E. 
Newbrough of Niles, and Attorney Kelly Stuart 
Newbrough and his wife Teresa of Niles, 
seven grandchildren, James L. Newbrough Ill 
and his wife Kristin, Eric Newbrough and his 
wife Erin, Kevin Kompanik (Roxy), Alex 
Newbrough, Hannah Newbrough (Jason Ray), 
Jacob ‘‘Jack’’ Newbrough, Olivia Newbrough, 
and five great-grandchildren, Ella, Evan, Lex-
ington, Mariah, and Kora. 
He was preceded in death by a grandson, 
Gary E. ‘‘Duke’’ Newbrough II, a grand-
daughter Sarah Lynn Newbrough, three broth-
ers, John, Steve, and Richard Newbrough, 
and two sisters, Julie Myers and Mary Jane 
Henck. 
I was very proud to call James a great 
friend and supporter. My deepest condolences 
go out to Jim’s entire family and to all whose 
lives he touched.

TRIBUTE TO THE HON. WALTER F. 
MONDALE, FORMER VICE PRESI-
DENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
tribute to the Honorable Walter F. Mondale, 
former Vice President of the United States of 
America, upon his death this week at age 93. 
Vice President Mondale was a global states-
man, a national political leader, a remarkable 
legislator, a proud Minnesotan, a devoted hus-
band, a wonderful father and grandfather, and 
a person people from all walks of life admired. 
Growing up in Elmore, Minnesota, Mondale 
never forgot his small-town roots. Generations 
of Minnesotans hold him in deep affection, be-
cause of his unique ability to connect through 
his humor, humility and humanity—which was 
nurtured by his beloved wife Joan. Together 
from their marriage in 1955 until her death in 
2014, Walter and Joan were a team who rep-
resented Minnesota and our country with 
grace, class and dignity. 
Inspired and reinforced by Joan, Walter 
Mondale’s life in public service was extraor-
dinary. He served in the United States Army, 
was the Minnesota Attorney General, and rep-
resented Minnesota in the United States Sen-
ate. One of his most important roles was rede-
fining the Vice Presidency of the United States 
as a partnership with the President. He also 
earned the 1984 Democratic nomination for 
President and broke a barrier by naming Ger-
aldine Ferraro to be the first woman Vice 
Presidential candidate on a major party ticket. 
And while serving as Ambassador to Japan, 
Walter and Joan demonstrated an unwavering 
commitment to the power of American diplo-
macy. 
Vice President Mondale’s deep and abiding 
dedication to civil rights, children, health care 
and the environment have left a profound leg-
acy for current and future generations of 
Americans. His pioneering leadership in pro-
tecting our air, land and water reflected his un-
derstanding that our precious lands and 
waters are the heart of who we are as Min-
nesotans and Americans, and that requires us 
to be responsible stewards of our planet. 
His authorship of the Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers Act in 1968 was a watershed moment in 
the environmental movement, bringing much- 
needed attention to these beautiful but threat-
ened rivers across the country, including the 
Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway in Min-
nesota and Wisconsin. He was also among 
the first and most steadfast champions for the 
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, be-
cause he understood that our biodiversity and 
clean water require permanent protection. 
I am deeply grateful for Vice President Mon-
dale’s kind and wise counsel to me in Con-
gress as I have worked to build on the suc-
cess of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the

SECURE AND FAIR ENFORCEMENT 
BANKING ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1996, the Secure and 
Fair Enforcement Banking Act, or the SAFE 
Banking Act, of which I am an original cospon-
sor. I want to thank my friend Congressman 
PERLMUTTER as well as Chairwoman WATERS 
and Chairman NADLER for their leadership on 
this issue. 
This bill creates protections for financial in-
stitutions to be able to provide financial serv-
ices to state-legal cannabis businesses and 
ancillary businesses. This would allow these 
businesses to access the banking system in-
stead of relying on cash transactions. 
Marijuana is currently legal in 36 states, 4 
territories and the District of Columbia for me-
dicinal or recreational use. This is an impor-
tant issue as financial institutions prohibit deal-
ing with cannabis businesses because of its 
current Schedule I, federal status. We need to 
ensure that these legitimate businesses have 
access to banking services as more states 
have medicinal and adult use cannabis pro-
grams. Many of these businesses are oper-
ating as cash only, which has created many 
issues for business owners and employees 
and has led to safety concerns for our com-
munities. 
I look forward to continuing to work with my 
colleagues on this and other marijuana related 
issues as they relate to racial and economic 
inequality. The SAFE Banking Act helps pro-
vide a solution to this financial issue, but we 
must not forget the larger systemic injustice of 
cannabis prohibition, which has disproportion-
ately impacted Black and brown communities 
through the war on drugs. We must work to-
gether to end federal cannabis prohibition and 
to pass the MORE Act.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FLOYD 
LITTLE 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of legendary Syracuse University 
Football Player and treasured member of the 
Syracuse community, Mr. Floyd Little, who 
passed away on January 1, 2021. 
Floyd Little played for the Syracuse Orange 
Football Team from 1964 to 1966 and donned 
the number 44. This iconic jersey number was 
assigned to some of the most accomplished 
Syracuse University running backs including 
Jim Brown and Ernie Davis. Like these leg-
endary athletes, Little achieved great success 
during his college playing career, earning 
three All-American Titles and was later in-
ducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. 
After leaving Syracuse, Little was drafted by 
the Denver Broncos in the 1967 and quickly 
emerged as a star in the National Football 
League (NFL). In his nine seasons in the 
league, Little was selected to five Pro-Bowls, 
amassed over 12,000 all-purpose yards, was 
the league’s rushing leader in 1971, and was 
later inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 
2010. 
Outside of football, Floyd Little was a com-
passionate and kind-hearted man who dedi-
cated much of his life to community service. 
He leveraged his success to give back to oth-
ers and empower his neighbors. Little became 
a distinguished speaker for charities and fund-
raisers across the country and frequently do-
nated his time to numerous philanthropic en-
deavors. He was particularly proud to support 
the annual Tom Coughlin Jay Fund fundraiser, 
which raises money to fight childhood cancer, 
and worked extensively with the Walter Camp 
Football Foundation, which provides athletic 
opportunities to youth across the country. Like 
his success in football, Little earned countless 
accolades in recognition of his generosity and 
commitment to serving others. Little and his 
family returned to the Central New York region 
in 2011 out of a desire to serve his alma 
mater and the community he loved. Central 
New York has undoubtedly benefitted from his 
presence over the past decade, and we all 
join his friends and family in mourning this 
loss. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring Mr. Floyd Lit-
tle. Little’s athletic legacy is one that is perma-
nently cemented in record-books and Syra-
cuse culture, and his crowning achievements 
will live on for generations to come. More im-
portantly, however, Little will be remembered 
as an incredibly generous man who lived his 
life in service to others. His charitable work re-
mains in the hearts of the thousands of people 
he helped throughout his life, and he will be 
remembered as a towering figure who came to 
be admired wherever he went.

REMEMBERING JOSEPH ‘‘JOE’’ R.

HON. TIM RYAN

Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Joseph ‘‘Joe’’ R. Merlo, who

Joe was born on June 8, 1945 and was be-
loved by many people in my community. He 
was a husband, father, uncle, great uncle, 
grandfather, great grandfather, cousin, and 
friend. 
Like many who grew up in Niles, Ohio, Joe 
was a legend. If you didn’t get your haircut by 
Joe at some point in your life, then you 
weren’t really a resident of Niles. 
I will always remember Joe for providing me 
with sage advice early in my political career. 
Anyone that knew Joe knew he was always 
fun to be around and was a true Northeast 
Ohioan. 
My deepest sympathies go out to Joe’s fam-
ily and to all whose lives he touched.

CHAPTER 
OF 
DELTA 
KAPPA GAMMA 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join the 
members of Connecticut’s Omicron Chapter of 
Delta Kappa Gamma as they celebrate their 
50th Anniversary—a remarkable milestone for 
this very special organization. 
The Delta Kappa Gamma International Soci-
ety is a unique organization whose member-
ship includes tens of thousands of women 
educators from across the globe. Members 
focus on promoting their professional and per-
sonal growth—striving for excellence in edu-
cation and dedicating themselves to making a 
difference in their students’ lives, in their com-
munities, and in the world. Over the course of 
the last fifty years, the members of Connecti-
cut’s Omicron Chapter have done just that. 
One of sixteen chapters of Delta Kappa 
Gamma in the state, members of the Omicron 
Chapter live or work throughout the Naugatuck 
Valley. They have made it their mission to pro-
vide unique programs to the communities of 
the Valley that blend education and service. 
The have distributed books to newborns, 
young children, children of prisoners, and 
adult education students. Many of their mem-
bers have knitted afghans and hats for both 
babies and cancer patients. They have helped 
to raise funds for UN-sponsored charities, the 
Ronald McDonald House, and the Umbrella, a 
shelter for victims of domestic abuse. 
Perhaps most inspiring are Omicron’s efforts 
on behalf of the next generations of educators. 
They understand the importance of nurturing 
those that will follow them in their professional 
pursuits. The Omicron chapter has sponsored 
the tuition for more than one-hundred fifty 
young women to attend Laurel Girls State, a 
one-week program rooted in civic education 
where they learn about how state and local 
government functions through a hands-on ap-
proach with state and local officials guiding the 
way. In addition, they also sponsor annual col-
lege scholarships to high school students 
planning to pursue careers in education. 
From dedicating their professional careers 
to providing our young people with the strong-
est of foundations on which to build their fu-
ture success to developing, implementing, and 
supporting programs that enrich the education 
of children outside the classroom, the Omicron 
chapter and its members have left an indelible 
mark on countless lives. I am proud to stand 
today to extend my heartfelt thanks and sin-
cere appreciation to Connecticut’s Omicron 
Chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma as they cele-
brate their 50th Anniversary. As we say in 
Italian—C’ent Anni—to another one hundred 
years.

Colleton County Election Commission, Ms. 
Fryar passed away on April 16, 2021. Her 
passing has left a huge void in the community. 
Ms. Fryar was born in 1949 to Leon Bryant, 
Sr., and Pattie Mae Gruber Bryant. She grad-
uated as the valedictorian from Ruffin High 
School in Colleton County, and went on to 
earn a degree in Secretarial Science from 
Orangeburg Calhoun Technical College. 
She spent 36 years working for Clemson 
University at the Cooperative Extension Serv-
ice in Colleton County. There she worked with 
youth development and outreach, using her 
care and concern for her community to build 
educational opportunities. She was awarded 
Clemson University’s Outstanding Service 
Award for her exemplary work. 
Following her retirement from the university, 
she chose not to slow down, but ramp up her 
community engagement. She spent three 
years working for AmeriCorps before becom-
ing a Victims’ Advocate at the Colleton County 
Sheriff’s Department. There she continued 
doing what she did best, serving as a source 
of strength for those in need. 
Ms. Fryar was very active politically. She 
joined the Colleton County Elections and Voter 
Registration Board in 2005 and served as its 
Chair. She continued to serve on the elections 
board until her death to ensure that all resi-
dents of Colleton County had access to the 
ballot box. 
Ms. Fryar had an incredible ability to con-
nect with people and was my MVP (most valu-
able proponent) in Colleton county. She be-
lieved strongly, just as I do, that we must all 
find something to do for which we are not 
paid. Her volunteer efforts were extensive, and 
all were focused on serving her beloved 
Colleton County. Her commitment to the com-
munity includes serving as a member of the 
S.C. Department of Education Personal Path-
ways Committee, the Keep Colleton Beautiful 
Committee, the Clemson University Coopera-
tive Extension Futures Task Force Committee, 
the Lowcountry Food Bank Board, and many 
other boards and commissions. She was the 
former Director for Youth Leadership Colleton 
and the former Coordinator for Backpack Bud-
dies in Colleton County. She held leadership 
offices with the Colleton County Branch of the 
NAACP, Colleton County Improvement Col-
laborative, the HCA Hospital Board of Trust-
ees, the Colleton County School Board of 
Trustees, 
the 
American 
Cancer 
Society 
(Colleton County), the American Cancer Soci-
ety Rehabilitation Committee (Colleton Coun-
ty), and the South Carolina Association of Co-
operative Extension Secretaries. 
Ms. Fryar remained dedicated to her alma 
mater and served as the liaison for Ruffin High 
School and the Colleton County Vocational 
Center. She also served on the Colleton 
County Transition Committee for the merger of 
Ruffin High School and Walterboro High 
School. She was also devoted to her church 
and served as several capacities including as 
a minister to the congregation. 
She was married to David L. Fryar, and they 
are the parents of three daughters, Katrina 
Fryar of Columbia, South Carolina, Ronda 
Cropp (Jeffrey) of Charlotte, North Carolina, 
and Muriel Fryar of Atlanta, Georgia. She also 
had two grandchildren and one great-grand-
child. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life and 
legacy of Lynette Fryar. Her passion for 
Colleton County’s people and places was un-
paralleled and her impact on her community 
will endure forever.

WAY 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the commu-
nity project of Patriot Parkway in El Dorado 
Springs, Missouri, which will be the adornment 
of 48 American flags along U.S. Highway 54 
within city limits. 
In a time of division, the El Dorado Springs 
Chamber of Commerce and members of the 
community have come together in an act of 
patriotism and unity. These flags will be dis-
played every year from Memorial Day to Vet-
erans Day to commemorate our veterans and 
to show some American pride. 
This project was a vision years ago by Jack 
Tough, a dedicated member of his community 
who unfortunately passed before he could see 
it through. However, his dream came true by 
the efforts of his son, Jackson Tough, and his 
fellow members of the El Dorado Springs 
Chamber of Commerce, who raised funds in 
the community to bring Patriot Parkway to life. 
Please join me in celebrating this act of pa-
triotism and community pride.

MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER 
PELOSI, AND HOUSE MINORITY LEADER MCCAR-
THY: We write to you today in support of the 
SAFE Banking Act, legislation that will per-
mit banks to provide services to state regu-
lated marijuana businesses, employees, and 
ancillary businesses. 
Unfortunately, under current federal law 
and regulations, state licensed and compli-
ant cannabis businesses are unable to access 
banking services and are forced to operate 
primarily in cash. This creates an unneces-
sary risk to public safety for store operators, 
employees, and customers. 
As we continue to see more states and ter-
ritories move forward with the regulation of 
some form of adult-use marijuana, medical 
marijuana, or hemp derived CBD, it is essen-
tial to address the crisis the industry faces 
to access banking. 
The threats faced by financial institutions 
of potential criminal prosecution for work-
ing with marijuana businesses as a result of 
the Controlled Substances Act are unaccept-
able and outdated. 
We strongly support the passage of the 
SAFE Banking Act and it is our hope that 
Congress will act swiftly.

AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, April 19, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the American 
Bankers Association (ABA), I am writing to 
express our strong support for H.R. 1996, the 
Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act 
(SAFE Banking Act) of 2021 introduced by 
Representatives 
Ed 
Perlmutter 
(D–CO), 
Steve Stivers (R–OH), Warren Davidson (R– 
OH), Nydia Vela´zquez (D–NY) and over 150 bi-
partisan cosponsors. 
This legislation, scheduled for consider-
ation on this week’s suspension calendar, ad-
dresses the conflict between federal and 
state law and whether banks can serve can-
nabis and cannabis related businesses. This 
issue has become a challenge for so many of 
our nation’s communities and the banks that 
serve them. We were pleased to see this legis-
lation passed the House of Representatives 
last Congress with over 300 bipartisan votes. 
With more states legalizing some form of 
cannabis use, we are hopeful that H.R. 1996 
will once again receive a favorable and 
strong bipartisan vote. 
Since 1996, voters across the country have 
determined that it is appropriate to allow 
their citizens to use cannabis for medical 
purposes and, since 2012, for adult use. Cur-
rently, 36 states have legalized cannabis for 
medical or adult use and that number con-
tinues to grow. Nevertheless, current federal 
law prevents banks from safely banking can-
nabis businesses, as well as the ancillary 
businesses that provide them with goods and 
services. 
As a result, a majority of states are strug-
gling to address the significant challenges to 
public safety, as well as regulatory and tax 
compliance that go hand-in-hand with busi-
nesses forced to operate in an all-cash envi-
ronment. Providing a mechanism for the 
cannabis industry to access the banking sys-
tem would help those communities reduce 
cash-motivated crimes, increase the effi-
ciency of tax collections, and improve the fi-
nancial transparency of the cannabis indus-
try. Since bank accounts are monitored in 
accordance with existing anti-money laun-
dering and Bank Secrecy Act requirements, 
bringing cannabis-related legitimate busi-
nesses into the mainstream banking sector 
would also help law enforcement to identify 
suspicious transactions—an opportunity that 
is not available in an all-cash environment. 
ABA does not take a position on the legal-
ization of cannabis. Nevertheless, our mem-
ber banks find themselves in a difficult situ-
ation due to the conflict between state and 
federal law, with local communities encour-
aging them to bank cannabis businesses and 
federal law prohibiting it. Congress must act 
to resolve this conflict between state and 
federal law. 
The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 
§ 801 et seq.) classifies cannabis as an illegal 
drug and prohibits its use for any purpose. 
For banks, that means that all proceeds gen-
erated by a cannabis-related business, even 
when it is operating in compliance with 
state law, are unlawful proceeds under fed-
eral law, and so any attempt to conduct a fi-
nancial transaction with that money (includ-
ing simply accepting a deposit) can be con-
sidered money-laundering. All banks, wheth-
er state or federally chartered, are subject to 
federal anti-money laundering laws. And, all 
banks must have access to the federal pay-
ment system to operate, which is under the 
purview of federal authority. Thus, banking 
entities related to the cannabis business can 
pose significant regulatory sanction risk, 
loss of access to the payments system, and 
the potential loss of the bank charter itself. 
This places banks in an untenable position in 
dealing with these state-authorized busi-
nesses. 
Currently, the only direction available to 
financial institutions in connection with 
cannabis-related accounts comes from guid-
ance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforce-
ment Network (FinCEN) in 2014. That guid-
ance, which references a now rescinded 
memorandum from the U.S. Department of 
Justice (the ‘‘Cole Memo’’), describes how fi-
nancial institutions can report cannabis-re-
lated business activity consistent with their 
Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It does not 
create a safe harbor or otherwise modify fed-
eral law to protect banks from criminal and 
civil liability for money laundering. It mere-
ly creates a system for reporting activity 
that is illegal under federal law but other-
wise legal under state law. 
Although some financial institutions have 
weighed the prevailing climate of non-en-
forcement and have decided to shoulder the 
risk in order to serve the needs of their com-
munities, the majority of financial institu-
tions will not take the legal, regulatory, or 
reputational risk associated with banking 
cannabis-related businesses without congres-
sional action. As a result, state-legal busi-
nesses are being excluded from the main-
stream financial system. 
The problems, though, are not limited to 
those businesses that have direct contact 
with the marijuana plant, such as growers 
and dispensaries. The impact of the divide 
between state and federal law extends to any 
person or business that derives revenue from 
a cannabis firm—including real estate own-
ers, security firms, utilities, vendors and em-
ployees of cannabis businesses, as well as in-
vestors. As the legal state-cannabis industry 
continues to grow, the indirect connections 
to cannabis revenues will also continue to 
expand. Without greater clarity, that entire 
portion of economic activity in legal can-
nabis states will continue to be marginalized 
from the banking system. 
The bipartisan SAFE Banking Act would 
be an important step toward enabling finan-
cial services for cannabis-related businesses. 
The bill specifies that proceeds from a legiti-
mate cannabis business would not be consid-
ered unlawful under federal money laun-
dering statutes or any other federal law, 
which is necessary to allow the provision of 
financial services to cannabis-related legiti-
mate businesses as well as any ancillary 
businesses that derive some portion of their 
income from those businesses. The bill would 
also direct FinCEN, and the federal banking 
regulators through the Federal Financial In-
stitutions Examination Council, to issue 
guidance and exam procedures for banks 
doing business with cannabis-related legiti-
mate businesses. Explicit, consistent direc-
tion from federal financial regulators will 
provide needed clarity for banks and help 
them better evaluate the risks and super-
visory expectations for cannabis-related cus-
tomers. The SAFE Banking Act is not a cure 
all for the cannabis banking challenge, but it 
is a measure that helps clarify many issues 
for the banking industry and regulators. 
ABA is pleased to support the SAFE Bank-
ing Act and urges members of the House of 
Representatives to vote in favor of this legis-
lation when it is brought up on this week’s 
suspension calendar. 
Sincerely, 
ROB NICHOLS. 
AMERICAN COUNCIL OF 
INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES, 
Washington, DC, April 19, 2021. 
U.S. Rep. PERLMUTTER, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REP. PERLMUTTER: I write today on 
behalf of the American Council of Inde-
pendent Laboratories (ACIL) in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1996, the Secure and Fair En-
forcement Banking Act (SAFE Banking Act) 
of 2021. 
ACIL is an association representing inde-
pendent commercial scientific and engineer-
ing firms with over 1,000 facilities across the 
U.S. engaged in testing, product certifi-
cation, consulting, and research and develop-
ment to enhance public health and safety. 
This bipartisan legislation would provide 
safe harbor to financial institutions doing 
business with the state-legal cannabis indus-
try. Since 1996, 47 states, four U.S. terri-
tories, and the District of Columbia have le-
galized some form of recreational or medical 
marijuana, including hemp and CBD prod-
ucts. However, cannabis remains illegal 
under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 
individuals who grow, possess, use, sell, 
transport, or distribute cannabis remain sub-
ject to federal criminal prosecution. Your 
legislation seeks to harmonize federal and 
state law by prohibiting federal regulators 
from taking punitive measures against de-
pository institutions that provide banking 
services to legitimate cannabis-related busi-
nesses engaged in manufacturing, growing, 
or producing, as well as any business who 
handles, sells, transports, displays or distrib-
utes cannabis or cannabis products. 
ACIL does not take a position on the legal-
ization of cannabis, but our membership find 
themselves in a quandary due to the conflict 
between state and federal law. 
Based upon the above, ACIL is pleased to 
support your SAFE Banking Act and we look 
forward to its passage in the U.S. Congress. 
Thank you for your time and attention. 
Please do not hesitate to call upon me if you 
have any questions. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD BRIGHT, 
Chief Operating Officer.

DEAR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS: We are a 
bipartisan group of state and territorial at-
torneys general committed to public safety, 
financial transparency, and the rule of law. 
On May 8, 2019, 38 state and territorial attor-
neys general urged passage of the Safe and 
Fair Enforcement (‘‘SAFE’’) Banking Act, or 
similar legislation, providing access to the 
regulated banking system for marijuana-re-
lated businesses in states with robust regu-
latory controls that ensure accountability in 
the marijuana industry. The undersigned at-
torneys general reiterate that support here 
and encourage Congress to take action expe-
ditiously. 
During the November 2020 election, voters 
in multiple states approved ballot measures 
to regulate cannabis for medical and/or adult 
use. Currently, forty-seven states, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and four U.S. territories 
have legalized some form of recreational or 
medical cannabis use (including CBD/low 
THC). In short, it is clear that legalized can-
nabis is here to stay. 
In forty-seven states, the District of Co-
lumbia, and four territories, cannabis is reg-
ulated through responsible and robust regu-
latory programs. Nonetheless, federal law 
currently inhibits the ability of national fi-
nancial institutions to provide banking and 
other financial services to cannabis-related 
businesses operating lawfully under state 
regulations. Without access to traditional fi-
nancial services, these businesses operate ex-
clusively or primarily in cash, making those 
businesses targets for criminal activity and 
hindering efforts to ensure regulatory and 
tax compliance and track financial flows. 
This status quo—a rapidly expanding, multi-
billion-dollar national marketplace without 
access to the national banking systems—is 
untenable. 
As we noted in our May 2019 letter to the 
congressional leadership, passage of the 
SAFE Banking Act or similar legislation, in 
no way constitutes an endorsement of any 
state or territory’s specific approach to the 
legalization 
of 
marijuana-related 
trans-
actions, and the Act is in no way an endorse-
ment for the legalization of medical or retail 
marijuana in those jurisdictions that choose 
not to pursue such an approach. But regard-
less of how individual policymakers feel 
about states permitting the use of medical or 
recreational marijuana, the reality of the 
situation requires federal rules that permit a 
sensible banking regime for legal busi-
nesses.’’ 
We further emphasized that passage of this 
legislation ‘‘reflects a recognition of the re-
alities on the ground and an embrace of our 
federalist system of government that is 
flexible enough to accommodate divergent 
state approaches.’’ 
To address an untenable status quo and 
recognize on the ground realities, we strong-
ly urge the House of Representatives and 
Senate to promptly take up and act upon the 
SAFE Banking Act. Our states’ ability to 
protect public safety and properly regulate 
this new and growing industry depends on 
Congress enacting this vital legislation. 
Respectfully, 
PHIL WEISER, 
Colorado Attorney General. 
WAYNE STENEHJEM, 
North Dakota Attorney General. 
KARL A. RACINE,

Warren Davidson (R–OH), had strong bipar-
tisan support in the 116th Congress with 206 
cosponsors, and passed the House 321–103. 
This legislation includes an important provi-
sion ending Operation Choke Point. Specifi-
cally, it prohibits a federal banking agency 
from ordering a bank to terminate a banking 
relationship with a legal business unless 
there is a valid reason that is not based sole-
ly on reputational risk. 
The ostensible intent of Choke Point pro-
gram was to prevent criminal fraud. How-
ever, in actuality, federal officials pressured 
banks to close accounts of businesses oper-
ating within state and federal law without 
legal recourse or due process solely because 
the officials were ideologically opposed to 
the businesses’ existence. Under Operation 
Choke Point, businesses that were operating 
legally suddenly found banks terminating 
their accounts, in some cases accounts that 
the business had had for years, without ex-
planation. While the program was targeted 
at gun dealers and payday lenders, other 
businesses, such as installment lenders, were 
also affected. No legal business should be 
targeted solely based on the political bias of 
a particular administration. 
Even after Operation Choke Point offi-
cially ended, its effects remained. Financial 
services companies that are licensed and reg-
ulated still had their accounts closed with 
very little explanation. Legitimate bank 
customers, like traditional installment lend-
ers, which have provided safe and affordable 
small-dollar credit to consumers in their 
communities for over a century, deserve fair 
access and fair treatment by federal banking 
agencies. 
Limiting the availability of lawful goods 
and services to consumers in an attempt to 
punish 
politically 
disfavored 
businesses 
harms consumers and sets a bad precedent. 
Government initiatives must be carried out 
on solid legal ground, not political bias. We 
urge members of the House of Representa-
tives to support the SAFE Banking Act.

CELIA WINSLOW, 
Senior Vice President, 
American Financial Services Association.

ARIZONA DISPENSARIES ASSOCIATION, 
17 March 2021. 
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE PERLMUTTER: The 
Arizona Dispensaries Association would like 
to thank you for your leadership as you 
move forward with the reintroduction of the 
Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Bank-
ing Act. With an eye to economics and public 
safety, we consider this legislation to be es-
sential to the businesses we represent. 
Cannabis businesses transact solely in 
cash, amounting to billions of dollars in cash 
transactions each year, which poses signifi-
cant public safety concerns. The Arizona 
cannabis program alone, which is the fourth 
top cannabis paradigm within the United 
States, garnered over $1 billion in sales in 
2020. Within the first ten days of recreational 
cannabis sales, Arizona businesses garnered 
at least $2.9 million. With over $1 billion in 
sales in 2020, received almost exclusively in 
cash payments, and an expanding rec-
reational cannabis market, Arizona busi-
nesses must then use this cash to pay em-
ployees and taxes. Arizona cannabis busi-
nesses paid $500,00 in excise taxes from the 
$2.9 million earned from those first ten days 
of recreational operations in January. With 
an influx of cash to cannabis operators, ob-
tained in an extremely short period of time, 
businesses can face difficulty in transporting 
taxation payments to local tax offices. This 
example underscores the immense challenges 
cannabis operators undergo due to cash only 
transactions. 
The reliance on cash transactions causes 
reason for safety concerns of not only indus-
try employees, but also the communities 
which they serve. As cannabis businesses op-
erate using cash transactions, it is necessary 
to keep large amounts of cash on the prem-
ises. Aware of this fact, criminal actors tar-
geted cannabis businesses for burglaries 
across the country in the spring of 2020. 
Members of the Arizona Dispensaries Asso-
ciation were targeted for these break-ins, re-
sulting in significant financial losses not 
only due to theft, but also as a result of the 
accompanying 
property 
damage. 
SAFE 
Banking would enhance the safety of indus-
try employees and the communities in which 
cannabis businesses operate by allowing 
businesses to drastically reduce the amount 
of cash on hand, lessening the chances of 
cannabis businesses being targeted for this 
type of criminal activity. Additionally, with 
the ability to process payments electroni-
cally, there is a more detailed and accurate 
accounting of business activity, increasing 
the potential for increased tax revenue over 
the long term. 
Nationwide, the cannabis industry’s four- 
year job growth rate is an astounding 161%. 
The Arizona cannabis industry alone em-
ploys 20,000 individuals, with over 5,000 of 
those opportunities being created within 
2020, which is especially noteworthy consid-
ering the far-reaching impacts of the COVID 
pandemic. As the SAFE Banking Act creates 
a safe harbor for financial institutions to 
bank the proceeds of state-legal cannabis 
businesses, its enactment is critical not only 
for Arizona’s cannabis industry to continue 
to grow at an exponential rate, but to also 
contribute to the State of Arizona’s eco-
nomic recovery during the aftershocks of the 
pandemic. 
SAFE Banking addresses many concerns 
ranging from economic viability to public 
safety, not only with bipartisan support, but 
with a neutral impact on the budget. Arizona 
Dispensaries association is prepared to work 
together to advance this legislation into law 
in the 117th Congress. 
Best regards, 
SAM RICHARD, 
Executive Director, 
Arizona Dispensaries Association.

Hon. ED PERLMUTTER,

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE PERLMUTTER: I am 
writing on behalf of the Association of Ber-
muda Insurers and Reinsurers (ABIR), which 
represents the public policy interests of Ber-
muda’s leading insurers and reinsurers and 
make up over 35% of the global reinsurance 
market based on property & casualty net 
premiums earned. ABIR members employ 
over 43,000 Americans in the U.S. and protect 
consumers around the world by providing af-
fordable and accessible insurance protection 
and peace of mind. 
ABIR writes in support of H.R. 1996, the 
SAFE Banking Act, and to thank you for 
your leadership on this issue. 
As you know, the current lack of harmoni-
zation between federal and state laws on can-
nabis banking deeply affects insurers and re-
insurers. We support Congress addressing 
this important issue for all financial services 
providers and specifically and applaud the 
inclusion of insurance and other financial 
products or services insurers in the SAFE 
Banking Act. 
Similar to other financial services pro-
viders, insurers are being forced to restrict 
providing insurance and other financial prod-
ucts or services to people working in state- 
legal cannabis jobs simply due to the source 
of their paycheck. The SAFE Banking Act 
would allow the financial services industry 
to serve the cannabis industry and will re-
sult in greater transparency for the state- 
legal operators. 
Thank you for your leadership on this nar-
rowly tailored yet profoundly important 
issue, and we look forward to working with 
you and your colleagues as legislation moves 
forward. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN M. HUFF, 
President & CEO.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E437 
April 21, 2021 
would like to thank you for your reintroduc-
tion of the Secure and Fair Enforcement or 
SAFE Banking Act. We again are in full sup-
port of this measure. 
In June of 2019, Illinois signed into law 
groundbreaking 
cannabis 
social 
equity 
standards to ensure the diversity and inclu-
sion of minority operators within the newly 
legalized adult use cannabis industry. These 
standards have quickly become the national 
template for other states seeking to develop 
social equity programs tied to their cannabis 
legalization efforts. 
Illinois’ social equity applicants have been 
significantly hindered due to their limited 
access to private capital and more prac-
tically 
to 
traditional 
financial 
services 
where they certainly could obtain loans and 
lines of credit to help offset startup costs 
and secure real estate. The SAFE Banking 
Act would not only resolve these financial 
challenges but also help to bolster the suc-
cess factor for many of these social equity 
applicants. 
The SAFE Banking Act would also be a 
great boon to the existing Illinois cannabis 
industry; their employees, their commu-
nities, their customers and of greater impor-
tance their patients. The Illinois cannabis 
industry garnered over $1 billion in cannabis 
sales in 2020, a sum of money that is difficult 
to manage without access to traditional 
banking services This lack of access to nor-
mal banking services, available to every 
other legal operating business in Illinois, is 
unfair and inequitable. The attack on ATM 
machines located in every Illinois dispensary 
during the Chicago August mass looting is a 
perfect example of the industry’s vulner-
ability because of cash insistent trans-
actions. Several of our association’s mem-
bers were targeted several times and sus-
tained massive physical damage as well as 
product theft. 
Even Illinois’ Treasurer, Michael Frerichs, 
is a staunch supporter of the SAFE Banking 
Act’s passage. He has gone on record stating 
the need to provide normal financial banking 
services to the cannabis industry creating 
more transparency and accountability with-
in this nascent industry. Allowing electronic 
payments between businesses promotes a 
healthier, safer economy. Currently finan-
cial institutions prohibit these transactions 
inhibiting everything from interstate spe-
cialty equipment purchases to software 
maintenance contracts even association dues 
payments! 
CBAI would like to thank you for your ef-
forts on behalf of the industry. This is a very 
important piece of legislation and we are 
grateful for your leadership in putting to-
gether a bipartisan advocacy team. If our 
statewide association can help in moving 
this legislation forward, please let us know.

PAMELA J. ALTHOFF, 
CBAI Executive Director. 
CALIFORNIA CANNABIS 
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, 
March 17, 2021. 
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE STIVERS, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. WARREN DAVIDSON, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES, 
PERLMUTTER, 
STIVERS, VELA´ ZQUEZ, AND
DAVIDSON: It is 
with great enthusiasm that we support the 
reintroduction of the Secure and Fair En-
forcement Banking Act of 2021 (‘‘SAFE 
Banking’’). The California Cannabis Industry 
Association (‘‘CCIA’’) is the largest and most 
influential trade association in the state of 
California representing the diverse interests 
of the cannabis industry: retail, cultivation, 
manufacturing, delivery, distribution, test-
ing, insurance, packaging, and various ancil-
lary services. Our unified voice includes 500 
businesses and represents nearly 15,000 em-
ployees across the state. SAFE Banking is 
not only critical to the economic success in 
our industry, but it is also imperative in im-
proving public safety and making the can-
nabis industry more equitable. 
I. SAFE BANKING CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR 
BIPOC INDIVIDUALS 
While cannabis is one of the fastest grow-
ing sectors in the United States, BIPOC indi-
viduals (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) 
have struggled to participate due to system-
atic economic racism and lack of access to 
capital. While some cities such as Oakland, 
San Francisco and Los Angeles have devel-
oped social equity programs with varying de-
grees of success, without access to capital, 
licenses obtained under these frameworks 
continue to be associated with high costs. 
Unfortunately, even in states like California 
that have equity programs written into their 
cannabis statutes, BIPOC owners fall prey to 
predatory business arrangements where a 
larger cannabis company will be effectively 
running the businesses through a manage-
ment services agreement while the minority 
owner becomes a figurehead. 
SAFE Banking would allow more banks, 
including community banks, to participate 
with the cannabis industry providing more 
opportunities for potential business owners. 
Additionally, SAFE Banking would make 
traditional financial instruments—like lines 
of credit—available to small operators. That 
capital is often the difference between suc-
cess or failure for a small business. Cur-
rently, most cannabis businesses are funded 
through private generational wealth or in-
vestment, areas in which BIPOC individuals 
lag when compared to their white peers. 
Every year women of color get less than 1% 
of total venture capital funding. Further, 
data from 2019 indicates that only 200 Latino 
and Black individuals nationwide, in all in-
dustries, were able to raise over $1 million in 
venture capital, making cannabis ownership 
all but unobtainable when start-up, oper-
ations costs, and licensing fees are consid-
ered. 
While SAFE Banking would not resolve the 
issues of systematic economic racism, the 
opportunity for BIPOC individuals to estab-
lish relationships with traditional lenders is 
a critical step in mitigating the damage 
done by the War on Drugs. 
II. SAFE BANKING IMPROVES PUBLIC SAFETY 
During the summer of 2020, over three 
dozen cannabis businesses in California were 
the target of robberies and break-ins, adding 
to a long string of targeted criminal activity 
in the state. Cannabis businesses known to 
have cash on hand become easy targets for 
petty and organized criminals. In most cases 
from last summer, professional burglars were 
caught on security footage stealing cash reg-
isters, safes, and ATMs. The looting and rob-
beries were so problematic that California’s 
Bureau of Cannabis Control, the state’s top 
regulator for cannabis activity, removed all 
cannabis 
business 
addresses 
from 
their 
website. 
Without question, an act of vandalism is 
distressing to any business, but cannabis 
businesses are faced with unique challenges 
due to lack of access to traditional financial 
services. Due to closures of local offices of 
the California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration (CDTFA) because of CO VI 
D–19, many cannabis businesses who regu-
larly visited these offices to pay their excise 
taxes in cash, were sitting on excise tax pay-
ments, waiting until the local branches to 
reopen. These excise tax payments were 
looted along with other cash and inventory. 
The reduction of cash on site at cannabis 
businesses will help reduce the chances of 
robberies but could also improve public 
health. Like many other states, over the 
course of the last year California designated 
cannabis businesses as essential and our op-
erations saw many come into our businesses 
to buy medicinal and adult use cannabis. 
However, all cash transactions require sig-
nificantly more face-to-face interaction than 
other types of payment systems and ran con-
trary to a Centers for Disease Control rec-
ommendation to limit cash sales. 
III. SAFE BANKING IS A JOB CREATOR 
California has the largest cannabis econ-
omy not only in the United States, but also 
in the world. The state legal industry em-
ployed a massive 57,970 individuals in 2020 
and generated over $3.4 billion dollars in 
sales. Of the nearly 60,000 individuals em-
ployed by the cannabis industry, over 23,000 
of those jobs were added during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
SAFE Banking could increase economic 
growth by ensuring that cannabis business 
could conduct regular payroll and deposit 
money into banks that could turn those de-
posits into outward facing loans. Access to 
traditional financial services would allow 
these businesses to hire more workers and 
open more facilities. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the safety of our employees and our 
communities we urge quick action on this 
critical piece of legislation. Removing fed-
eral law barriers to banking services for 
state-legal cannabis businesses, would cata-
lyze economic growth in our state and 
around the country. Banking reform is es-
sential to the diversity and growth of the 
cannabis industry. CCIA is proud to support 
this bipartisan bill and looks forward to sup-
porting the efforts to passage. 
Sincerely, 
LINDSAY ROBINSON, 
Executive Director, 
California Cannabis Industry Association. 
COLORADO BANKERS ASSOCIATION. 
REPRESENTATIVE PERLMUTTER: The Colo-
rado Bankers Association is proud to again 
endorse the SAFE Banking Act to allow 
state-legal cannabis businesses access to 
banking services. We have supported this in 
previous years. CBA represents over 95% of 
the banking industry in Colorado and we 
support the bill to get cash off the streets 
and make our communities safer. 
Banking 
operations 
are 
greatly 
com-
plicated by the conflict of state and federal 
law on cannabis. That creates substantial 
problems for handling cannabis deposits 
which range from cash handling and security 
to major compliance issues with FinCEN re-
quirements for Suspicious Activity Reports 
required by the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti 
Money Laundering laws. For local banks 
that usually results in a bank not knowingly 
handling cannabis related accounts. For re-
gional and nationwide banks that almost al-
ways results in not banking cannabis ac-
counts. 
Lending 
issues 
are 
more 
com-
plicated. 
Due to widespread legalization of some 
form of recreational or medical marijuana, 
including CBD oil, today 97.7% of the popu-
lation in the U.S. lives in cannabis friendly 
jurisdictions. We very much believe it is up 
to each state and its voters to decide how to 
proceed with marijuana laws, but there is a 
clear need to align federal and state laws ad-
dressing the related banking problems. 
The state/federal conflict of laws creates 
restrictions on banks for accepting cannabis 
related deposits. This poses a serious public

safety risk and is our primary reason for ad-
vocating the SAFE Banking Act. Addition-
ally, financial institutions that provide 
banking services to state-legal marijuana 
businesses are currently subject to criminal 
prosecution for ‘‘aiding and abetting’’ a fed-
eral crime and money laundering allegations 
due to the Controlled Substances Act. Bank-
ing services such as accepting credit card 
payments, depositing revenues, and writing 
checks to pay employees, vendors and taxes 
are needed by licensed and regulated can-
nabis businesses that are now cut off from 
such banking services. 
The SAFE Banking Act creates the ability 
to access the banking system and make our 
communities safer. The bill removes viola-
tions of money laundering laws for any pro-
ceeds derived from state-legal marijuana 
businesses. The result is to get cash off the 
streets and into the financial system which 
is built to identify and block or report fraud 
and illicit activity. This bill also contains 
needed protections for hemp and hemp-de-
rived CBD related businesses, which still 
struggle in accessing financial services de-
spite the legalization of hemp in the 2018 
Farm Bill. 
The 
Colorado 
Bankers 
Association 
is 
pleased to support this needed change in fed-
eral law. Please contact us with any ques-
tions.

Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STEVE STIVERS,

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER, STIV-
ERS, VELA´ ZQUEZ, AND DAVIDSON: On behalf of 
America’s credit unions, I am writing in sup-
port of the Secure and Fair Enforcement 
(SAFE) Banking Act of 2021, which would 
permit credit unions in states where mari-
juana is legal to safely serve their members’ 
related needs. The Credit Union National As-
sociation (CUNA) represents America’s cred-
it unions and their more than 120 million 
members. 
Credit unions exist to serve the financial 
services needs of their members, but the dis-
parate treatment of production, distribution, 
sale and use of cannabis under federal law 
and some state laws has discouraged them 
from 
providing 
services 
to 
businesses 
throughout the supply chain in states where 
cannabis is legal. In recent years, as various 
states have legalized cannabis for medicinal 
and recreational use, participants in the 
market have sought out credit unions to pro-
vide safe and affordable financial services. In 
recent years, 36 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands have approved medical marijuana 
and cannabis programs. 
CUNA takes no position on legalizing or 
decriminalizing medicinal or recreational 
cannabis at either the state or federal level. 
However, credit unions operating in states 
where it is legal have members and member 
businesses involved in the cannabis market 
who need access to traditional depository 
and lending services, the absence of which 
creates a significant public safety issue. A 
2015 analysis found that, in the absence of 
being banked, one in every two cannabis 
dispensaries were robbed or burglarized— 
with the average thief walking away with 
anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 in a single 
theft. 
Additionally, even financial institutions 
that choose not to bank the cannabis indus-
try still risk unknowingly serving those 
businesses in states where cannabis is legal. 
Indirect connections are often difficult to 
identify and avoid because like any other in-
dustry, those offering cannabis-related serv-
ices work with vendors and suppliers. These 
are Main Street businesses like the printing 
company that makes a business card, the 
landlord that rents office space, and even the 
utility company that provides water or elec-
tricity. Under the existing status quo, a 
credit union that does business with any one 
of these indirectly affiliated entities could 
unknowingly risk violating federal law. 
The SAFE Banking Act of 2021 would offer 
narrowly targeted federal protections for 
credit unions and other financial institu-
tions accepting deposits, extending credit, or 
providing payment services to an individual 
or business engaged in cannabis related com-
merce in states where such activity is legal 
with a safe harbor, so long as they are com-
pliant with all other applicable laws and reg-
ulations. Furthermore, the SAFE Banking 
Act provides safe harbor to credit unions and 
their employees who are not aware if their 
members or customers are involved in this 
business. 
Many credit unions operate in states where 
their voters or legislatures have made can-
nabis legal in one form or another. There-
fore, CUNA believes that financial institu-
tions should be permitted to lawfully serve 
businesses that engage in activities author-
ized under their state laws, even when such 
activity may be inconsistent with federal 
law. 
For that reason, CUNA has long supported 
the SAFE Banking Act and we look forward 
to working with you to advance this legisla-
tion into law. On behalf of America’s credit 
unions, thank you for your leadership on this 
important issue. 
Sincerely, 
JIM NUSSLE, 
President & CEO.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
RICHARD ERICKSON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. KELLY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of Richard Erickson, who 
passed away on February 21, 2021. He was 
a true servant to his family, community, and 
country and he will be deeply missed. 
‘‘Dick’’ Erickson was born on March 8, 1952 
to Leslie and Alida Erickson in Preston, Min-
nesota. He attended Elementary School at 
Highland Country School, and at the age of 12 
he left home to work for a local farmer. He 
later attended high school in Lanesboro, Min-
nesota. At age 17, Dick enlisted in the United 
States Navy. He served in the Vietnam War 
aboard the USS Newport News. 
After returning, Dick began his 38 year ca-
reer in law enforcement. He attended the Rio 
Hondo Police Academy in Whittier, California 
before joining the police force in Tupelo, Mis-
sissippi. He worked as an undercover nar-
cotics officer and became a K–9 officer where 
he met his new partner, a German Shepard 
named Akky. The pair served together as Dick 
headed up the Tupelo Drug Task Force. Dick 
ended his career as the Chief of Police in 
Mantachie, MS. As a Mississippian, Dick 
served in the Army and Mississippi National 
Guard. In his 8 year career, he earned his 
combat medic’s license and the rank of E6. 
Mr. Erickson is survived by his mother, 
Alida; brother, Larry; sister Mary Brown; nine 
children; and thirteen grandchildren. 
Dick Erickson was a dedicated community 
servant and a beloved father, brother, and 
leader. I am grateful for his service to state 
and country and join countless others in 
mourning his loss.

IN HONOR OF THE SERVICE OF 
COLONEL CHRIS A. MCKINNEY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Colonel Chris A. McKinney, 
the outgoing Commander of the 177 Military 
Police Brigade. A key figure in protecting our 
Capitol, his service to our community and to 
our nation are worthy of commendation. 
Colonel McKinney’s military and federal ci-
vilian service spans over three decades. He 
began his service as a Second Lieutenant and 
was selected for the Corps of Engineers in 
1993. He served as an Engineer Platoon 
Leader, and as Executive Officer and Com-
pany Commander for C Co. 1/151st Infantry. 
He also served assignments in Aviation, the 
Judge Advocate General Corps and the Mili-
tary Police Corps, as well as in the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and Department of 
Homeland Security. Deployed in combat to Af-
ghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom 
and to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom, he 
served as a member of the Combined Joint 
Special 
Operations 
Task 
Force. 
Colonel 
McKinney has earned numerous awards and 
decorations for his service across the country 
and globe, including the Legion of Merit and 
Bronze Star Medal. 
During Colonel McKinney’s tenure he led

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FEAST OF SAINT 
SEBASTIAN 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join the 
Saint Sebastian Church, its membership and 
the community of Middletown, Connecticut as 
they celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the 
Feast of Saint Sebastian—a celebration of 
ethnic pride and culture that has grown to be-
come a treasured community tradition. 
The first immigrants from Melilli, Sicily ar-
rived in the City of Middletown in 1895. Over 
the course of the next several decades, the 
number of Melillesi who came to call Middle-
town home grew exponentially, forming a tight- 
knit community in the City’s North End. As the 
Melillesi families grew so did their desire to 
celebrate their rich history and tradition. Like 
in so many other Italian-American commu-
nities, they did so through the annual religious 
celebrations of the patron saint of their home-
town, Saint Sebastian. This small neighbor-
hood celebration has since grown into one of 
the City’s most well-known and popular annual 
traditions. 
By 1921, the annual Feast of Saint Sebas-
tian had become a major event in the Sicilian 
community, attracting participants not only 
from Middletown but surrounding towns as 
well. It was in 1921 that the first official feast 
committee was formed and when the first stat-
ue of Saint Sebastian, a gift designed and 
sculpted by local laborer Sebastiano Mar-
chese, was presented to the community. It 
was also from this first major Feast and its 
collection of funds, that the first steps toward 
the creation of the Saint Sebastian Church 
and Parish were taken. Just over a decade 
later, after approval from the diocese and the 
purchase of properties for the church and rec-
tory, the cornerstone was placed and con-
struction of Saint Sebastian Church was com-
pleted within a year. Today, Saint Sebastian 
Church, which almost mirrors its companion of 
the same name in Melilli, continues to be the 
heartbeat of Middletown’s Italian-American 
community, and the Feast remains an annual 
tradition that the whole City looks forward to 
celebrating. 
The Feast of Saint Sebastian, whose festivi-
ties now span three days, is a celebration of 
the Melillesi culture. Booths provide food and 
drink, games and carnival rides entertain 
adults and children, and the main stage pro-
vides musical entertainment where many gath-
er to sing and dance. Special masses are held 
and upon entering the Church one can view 
the statue of Saint Sebastian, often hearing 
chants of ‘‘Santo Sebastiano’’ as those gath-
ered pray to the patron saint. And on the Sun-
day of the Feast, hundreds dressed all in 
white with red sashes attend the ‘‘I Nuri’’ run-
ning—the procession of Saint Sebastian. It is 
a remarkable sight to behold. 
People across the country struggle to create 
a sense of community—a sense of belonging. 
Over the course of its one-hundred-year his-
tory, the Feast of Saint Sebastian has helped 
the families of Middletown’s Melillesi immi-
grants and their descendants do just that. This 
year, as they mark its centennial anniversary, 
I am proud to stand and extend my sincere 
thanks and appreciation to all of those, past 
and present, who have made the Feast of 
Saint Sebastian such a special celebration. 
The bonds of community that the Feast has 
helped to shape will continue to impact gen-
erations to come.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
JUANA SEQUEIRA SOLIS 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 21, 2021 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in memory of Juana Sequeira Solis who 
passed away on April 6, 2021 at the age of 
94. She was born in 1926 in Nicaragua and 
was the eldest of five children. 
In 1945, at the age of 18, she immigrated to 
the United States in search of a better life. In 
1950, she moved to Los Angeles where she 
met her late husband, Raul S. Solis, while tak-
ing citizenship classes. The couple then mar-
ried in October of 1953. 
Mrs. Solis and her late husband raised 
seven children in the unincorporated area of 
La Puente, California. 
She enjoyed cooking for her family and 
friends and was an avid gardener. The family 
was her focal point where she taught her chil-
dren to give back to their community; stressed 
the importance of achieving a higher edu-
cation; and preserving the environment. 
Mrs. Solis was a devout Roman Catholic. 
Mrs. Solis worked hard to provide for her 
children and was employed for over 20 years 
as an assembly line worker at Mattel Inc. until 
her retirement in 1991. She was an active 
union member with the United Rubber Work-
ers. 
Mrs. Solis is preceded in death by her be-
loved husband of 58 years, Raul S. Solis, who 
was a proud Teamster and her beloved 
daughter, Beatriz M. Solis, who served as the 
Director for Healthy Communities at the Cali-
fornia Endowment. 
She is survived by her children: Irma 
Rincon, Raul Solis, Jr., Hilda Solis, Victor 
Solis, Anna Solis, Leticia Solis and their 
spouses; 10 grandchildren, and 23 great- 
grandchildren. 
She will be remembered for her kindness 
and fighting spirit. She will be deeply missed 
by all who knew her. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that Members in the 
House Chamber please join me for a moment 
of silence to honor the life of Juana Sequeira 
Solis.
