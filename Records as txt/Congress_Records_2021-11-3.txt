PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Creator God, open our eyes to the 
gift that You have laid before us this 
day. Fill us early with an awareness of 
Your unfailing love, that throughout 
the day we would know the satisfaction 
of happiness found only in You and the 
content of joy that we have in Your 
love for us. 
At every moment of the day, bring us 
evidence of Your loving kindness. At 
every turn, cause us to know what way 
You would have us walk. At every en-
counter, give us the word You would 
have us speak. 
For we put our trust in You. When all 
else around us proves fleeting, be our 
constant. 
When 
disappointments 
erode 
our 
sense of certainty, may our faith in 
You be sure. 
When we weary from our labor, may 
we find strength in the foundation You 
have laid for our days. 
When we are inclined to doubt, may 
our reverence of You fill us with the 
joy of our salvation. 
In Your mercy may we receive today 
a wealth of wisdom and knowledge. 
Hear now our gratitude for the daily 
favor You have shown us as we offer 
our prayers in Your most holy name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. PAPPAS led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
GOOD BILLS 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the 
House continues to pursue the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and the Build 
Back Better bill. There will be a Rules 
Committee meeting today on those 
bills. Hopefully, they will come to the 
floor and will pass with bipartisan sup-
port, as the infrastructure bill was 
passed with bipartisan support in the 
Senate. 
The House has been working to get 
the framework improved to include 
other issues. There are so many good 
issues that we can have in this bill, and 
we hope to have the maximum possible. 
But as a baker once said, and my fa-
ther implored me as a child: Look at 
the doughnut, and not at the hole. 
We will pass a very good bill, hope-
fully bipartisan. 
f 
TIME TO SECURE OUR BORDER 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as Congress debates spending 
trillions of taxpayer dollars, there is a 
crisis on our southern border that is 
being ignored. 
In the past year, our Border Patrol 
agents have made almost 1.5 million 
apprehensions, yet we are still seeing 
that there is a massive surge in illegal 
immigration. 
The rise in overdose deaths that our 
country has seen can be directly tied to 
the increase in fentanyl that is being 
smuggled 
into 
the 
United 
States 
through Mexico. Now, at the height of 
the crisis, we are seeing reports that 
the Biden administration wants to pay 
settlements to immigrants who enter 
our country illegally. This is unaccept-
able. 
Now is the time to secure our border 
and stop the security and humani-
tarian crises that this policy has cre-
ated. 
Right now, Congress should be work-
ing to address the real and present dan-
ger at our southern border, not debat-
ing yet another socialist spending 
spree. 
f 
THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR VOTING 
RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT 
(Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BEATTY. On behalf of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and the mil-
lions of Black voters, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Today, we step into history as we 
tread the same path taken 56 years ago 
when President Lyndon Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act into law, calling 
that day ‘‘a triumph for freedom as 
huge as any victory that has ever been 
won on any battlefield.’’ 
We have not come this far to turn the 
clock back, nor shall we let the sac-
rifices of Fannie Lou Hamer, Martin 
Luther King, and countless others who 
marched, fought, disrupted, and lost 
their lives for the right to vote, be in 
vain.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6130 
November 3, 2021 
Therefore, I ask all of my colleagues 
to support H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
As our friend and brother, the late 
John Lewis, said so well: ‘‘The time is 
right. The time is now.’’ 
Our Power, Our Message. 
f 
BUILD BACK BROKE 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, President Biden looks to call 
his phony tax-and-spend plan Build 
Back Better when it actually should be 
called build back broke. It broke last 
night, and it is breaking this week. 
This plan is a disaster for Americans 
and the future of our small businesses. 
The 
National 
Federation 
of 
Inde-
pendent Business recently reported 
that over two-thirds of small busi-
nesses faced significant impacts from 
the supply chain disruptions. Fifty-one 
percent of owners reported they are 
still unable to fill job openings. And 
uncertainty about the future among 
small business owners increased by 5 
points, according to the NFIB Uncer-
tainty Index. 
American small businesses are facing 
unprecedented challenges, and unfortu-
nately, Washington bureaucrats are 
turning their backs on their concerns 
and pushing ahead to increase taxes, 
fuel rising inflation, and expand gov-
ernment control. 
I came to Washington to fight for 
Main Street America. That is what I 
am. And every American should know 
these closed-door negotiations and so-
cialist policies are fiscal insanity and 
will crush our economy. 
Cut taxes and save our economy, a 
new concept. 
In God We Trust. 
f 
HONORING STAFF SERGEANT 
JESSE SHERRILL 
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to the life and service of 
New Hampshire State Police Staff Ser-
geant Jesse Sherrill. Staff Sergeant 
Sherrill was tragically killed on Octo-
ber 28 when his cruiser was struck by a 
tractor-trailer when he was on duty 
working an overnight detail. 
This is an immeasurable loss for his 
family and community and the entire 
State of New Hampshire. 
Today, our State will pause for a 
celebration of life for Staff Sergeant 
Sherrill. My thoughts and prayers are 
with his wife and their children and ex-
tended family. We must never forget 
his dedicated service to keeping our 
State safe and the burden borne by the 
Sherrill family. 
My thoughts are also with the men 
and women of the New Hampshire 
State Police and law enforcement com-
munity that has lost one of its own. 
Day in and day out, those who serve 
and protect our communities risk their 
own safety for all of us. We can never 
forget their sacrifice. 
I urge Granite Staters to take time 
to reflect on the legacy of Staff Ser-
geant Sherrill and to keep his family in 
your thoughts and prayers. 
Through this horrible tragedy, we 
must honor his example and keep his 
memory alive. 
f 
RECOGNIZING WILLIE JETT 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of St. Cloud area 
school district superintendent Willie 
Jett. Willie will be retiring from his 
role as superintendent at the end of 
this school year, ending 8 years in serv-
ice to the district. 
During his tenure, Willie has been an 
advocate for students, a leader for fac-
ulty, and an ally to parents. When the 
district experienced challenges, Willie 
focused on a student-centric approach 
to 
education. 
Willie’s 
leadership 
prioritized the performance of each 
student and provided the support they 
needed to thrive. 
Willie led the St. Cloud school dis-
trict through times of crisis and 
change. He helped schools rebuild after 
fires and successfully navigated the 
COVID–19 crisis. Willie oversaw the 
construction of the new St. Cloud Tech 
High School and an early childhood 
education center. Willie even partici-
pated in one of our Congressional tele-
phone townhalls to answer questions 
about remote learning for families 
across the St. Cloud community. 
Willie remains a friend and leader in 
our community. Willie’s presence in 
the St. Cloud school district will be 
missed. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Willie for 
all of his work, and I wish him good 
luck in the next chapter of his life. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FAMILY 
CAREGIVERS MONTH 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
November as National Family Care-
givers Month. 
Nearly 600,000 New Yorkers are care-
givers for loved ones living with de-
mentia. This is difficult work, and it 
takes an emotional toll that too often 
goes unrecognized. 
My bill, the Comprehensive Care for 
Alzheimer’s Act, would enact higher- 
quality dementia care standards in 
Medicare and Medicaid. It broadens as-
sistance, including direct education 
and support for caregivers and im-
proved access to high-quality doctors 
with expertise in dementia. 
Dementia care is very complex, so we 
need to do all we can to make sure the 
patients and their families have what 
they need. 
I hear regularly from my Alzheimer’s 
advocates in Buffalo and western New 
York and throughout New York that 
much more needs to be done. 
This bill can help them get the best 
possible care for their loved ones while 
providing support to them as care-
givers. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
f 
HIGH COST OF A BIDEN 
THANKSGIVING 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, as Biden continues to 
push the insulting $3.5 trillion Big Gov-
ernment socialist scheme, real Ameri-
cans will see their Thanksgiving 2021 
‘‘shaping up to be the most expensive 
meal in the history of the holiday,’’ as 
reported by MSNBC. 
The price of turkey already costs 25 
cents more per pound. It is not the 
only part of the holiday to take a bite 
out of your family account, with Biden 
inflation destroying jobs. 
‘‘Nearly every component of the tra-
ditional American Thanksgiving din-
ner, from the disposable aluminum tur-
key roasting pan to the coffee and pie, 
will cost more this year,’’ as sadly ad-
mitted by The New York Times. 
Democrat elite think they are smart-
er than anyone, and they believe Dem-
ocrat voters are ignorant to believe 
that $3.5 trillion in spending costs zero 
dollars. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America. 
Congratulations to the people of Vir-
ginia and New Jersey and Springdale 
Mayor-elect Justin Ricard.

MAKING GOOD DECISIONS WITH 
GOOD INFORMATION 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the Fis-
cal State of the Nation Resolution, H. 
Con. Res. 44, which the House will con-
sider later today. 
When I came to Congress, I promised 
my constituents that we would make 
responsible decisions about our Na-
tion’s fiscal future. It is extremely dif-
ficult, however, to make good decisions 
without good information. 
The Fiscal State of the Nation Reso-
lution will require the Comptroller 
General to provide an annual assess-
ment of our Nation’s finances to Con-
gress, a small but important first step 
in getting our fiscal house in order. 
Similarly, my bipartisan bill, the Du-
plication Scoring Act, would ensure

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6131 
November 3, 2021 
Members are aware when new bills po-
tentially duplicate existing programs 
in areas which have already been iden-
tified by the GAO. 
I urge all Members to support pas-
sage of the Fiscal State of the Nation 
act today and renew our commitment 
to putting our Nation on a sustainable 
fiscal trajectory. 
f 
VACCINE MANDATE UNDERMINES 
ESSENTIAL SERVICES 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
when the coronavirus shut down this 
country, 
first 
responders 
and 
healthcare professionals kept our com-
munities going and safe. The essential 
services they provide can’t be done 
from behind a computer screen, Madam 
Speaker. 
Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate under-
mines the preparedness of these serv-
ices. The Americans we celebrated for 
the last 20 months are now forced to 
get the coronavirus vaccine or be fired 
from their jobs. It is disgusting that 
the Biden administration is threat-
ening these public servants’ livelihoods 
over these issues. 
Our country cannot afford labor 
shortages in essential services. Look at 
law enforcement, for example. The 
defund the police movement continues 
to embolden criminals and lower mo-
rale among the law enforcement com-
munity. 
On top of these problems, thousands 
of police officers are facing termi-
nation thanks to Biden’s vaccine man-
date. 
This is a recipe for disaster amidst 
rising crime. I guarantee that if you 
are in danger of or a victim of crime, 
the last thing on your mind will be the 
vaccination status of the responding 
officer. 
Congress needs to stand up for these 
essential workers under attack from 
Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate. This 
week, I will introduce legislation al-
lowing these workers to decide for 
themselves on taking the coronavirus 
vaccine, free from threats of termi-
nation if they decide against getting 
the shot, Madam Speaker. No Amer-
ican citizen should be fired for making 
a healthcare decision they believe is in 
their best interest.

HEALTH EQUITY PROVISIONS OF 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to urge my col-
leagues to pass the Build Back Better 
Act. 
The Build Back Better Act will bring 
transformational change to the Amer-
ican people, create a more equitable 
healthcare system, and save lives. 
One of the greatest ongoing injus-
tices in our country is just how many 
people do not have access to affordable 
healthcare. That population is over-
whelmingly made up of people of color 
and rural Americans. 
Policymakers and medical institu-
tions 
have 
not 
prioritized 
the 
healthcare needs of communities of 
color and rural communities. The Build 
Back Better Act will help these com-
munities by closing the healthcare cov-
erage gap, create more affordable cov-
erage options, expand benefits for sen-
iors, invest in improving access to 
mental health and substance use dis-
orders, attack the gun violence epi-
demic with public-health focused inter-
ventions, invest in addressing the 
Black maternal mortality crisis, and 
lowering the cost of prescription drugs. 
Investing in affordable care, prevent-
ative care, and targeted reductions in 
violence will result in fewer extreme 
health 
scenarios, 
fewer 
emergency 
room visits, and over time, will save us 
money and reduce the burden on our 
healthcare system. 
Healthcare is a human right. Passing 
the Build Back Better Act is a step in 
the right direction. 
f 
RECOGNIZING FFA NATIONAL 
PRESIDENT COLE BAERLOCHER 
(Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize one of Eastern Washington’s finest 
young men, Cole Baerlocher. 
Cole is a student at Washington 
State University, and he recently was 
elected to serve as the next national 
president of the Future Farmers of 
America. 
For Cole, his family, and our entire 
community, this is a huge deal. Cole is 
from Colfax, the county seat of Whit-
man County, the top wheat-producing 
county in America. 
Having him serve as the face of this 
organization is a tremendous honor. 
The FFA has more than 735,000 mem-
bers; 37 candidates were considered for 
the honor of serving as president. Only 
one was selected to lead, and that per-
son was Cole. 
Cole, I know I speak for our entire 
community when I say congratulations 
on this incredible achievement. We 
could not be more proud. Go Cougs! 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER CHILDCARE 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the inclusion 
of universal childcare and early edu-
cation as part of the President’s Build 
Back Better legislative agenda. 
In Massachusetts, a family with two 
young children spends on average 28 
percent of their income on childcare 
for 1 year. The Build Back Better Act 
will provide universal, high-quality, 
free preschool for every three-and four- 
year-old in America. It will ensure that 
a four-person Massachusetts family 
making up to $170,000 pays no more 
than 7 percent of their income on high- 
quality childcare. 
Investing in the health and education 
of our children is the best long-term in-
vestment our country can make. With 
our future in mind, we must provide 
access to as many families as possible, 
as soon as possible. This will require 
raising provider wages to a living wage 
immediately and ensuring that more 
families can benefit in year one when 
we pass the Build Back Better Act. 
f 
ADDRESSING AMERICA’S ENERGY 
CRISIS 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, this 
time last year, America was energy 
independent. Now our Nation is facing 
a full-blown energy crisis, leaving the 
American 
people 
to 
ask, 
‘‘What 
changed?’’ 
Well, the answer is simple. 
Unlike the Trump administration, 
the Biden administration is determined 
to make it more difficult for American 
energy producers to develop affordable 
and reliable energy here at home. 
On his first day in office, Joe Biden 
canceled the Keystone pipeline. Soon 
after, he banned all new oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands. As a result, 
Americans are paying exponentially 
more at the pump with gas prices 
reaching a 7-year high. And this win-
ter, the cost to heat our homes is ex-
pected to jump 54 percent. 
As the top Republican on the Sub-
committee on Energy and Mineral Re-
sources, I have been disappointed to see 
Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress 
double down on their failed agenda by 
pushing a $5.5 trillion tax-and-spend 
package that will only increase our en-
ergy prices. 
Instead of canceling commonsense 
energy projects, let’s empower Amer-
ican energy workers to do what they do 
best. Instead of targeting American en-
ergy companies, let’s make it easier for 
them to increase domestic oil and gas 
production. 
If we do this, the next century can be 
an American century.

BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA

portunity to make transformational

We can’t let the perfect be the enemy

CONGRATULATING 
SOLON 
HIGH 
SCHOOL GIRLS CROSS COUNTRY 
TEAM 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
group of young women who have made 
history in a small town in my district. 
Last week, the Solon High School 
Girls Cross Country team defied the 
odds at the 3A Iowa State champion-
ship and brought home their first girls 
cross country title after upsetting last 
year’s champion, Ballard High School. 
Led by top ten finishers, Kayla 
Young and Emma Bock, every Solon 
Spartan finished in the top 54 in a 
crowded 133-member field, earning a 
total score of 77 points. 
Congratulations 
to 
Kayla 
Young, 
Emma Bock, Anna Quillin, Meghan 
O’Neill, 
Mara 
Duster, 
Gracie 
Federspiel, and Kaia Holtkamp. This is 
a great achievement for both Solon and 
the Second District, and I could not be 
prouder to represent all of these young 
women in Congress.

HONORING THE LIFE AND IMPACT 
OF JOHN H. JOHNSON 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H. Res. 605, to 
honor the life and impact of John H. 
Johnson. 
Though he was born in Arkansas, and 
known for his work in Chicago, John-
son’s impact isn’t limited by geog-
raphy. In fact, in the village of Harlem, 
his work is beloved. He was a trail-
blazer 
of 
African-American 
media, 
starting his first magazine at 24, going 
on to have an internationally ac-
claimed career in publishing, with 
magazines like Ebony and Jet being 
globally renowned and internationally 
recognizable to this very day. 
Madam Speaker, Johnson said that 
you have to change images before you 
can change acts and institutions—and 
changing acts and institutions, he did. 
The impact Johnson had on his com-
munity and the world of media cannot 
be understated, and still serves as a 
role model of perseverance and success 
to this very day, inspiring the next 
generation of Black and Brown leaders. 
November 1 is celebrated in Arkansas 
as John H. Johnson Day. With great 
pride, I rise today to support this reso-
lution, but he is also revered and loved 
in the village of Harlem.

CONGRATULATING 
ATLANTA 
BRAVES AS 2021 WORLD SERIES 
CHAMPIONS 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the 2021 World 
Series champions, the Atlanta Braves. 
After a stunning six-game World Se-
ries against the Houston Astros, culmi-
nating in a shutout victory last night, 
the Braves brought home the Commis-
sioner’s Trophy for the first time since 
1995. 
I, along with millions of Georgians, 
am incredibly proud of this Braves 
team for their unparalleled talent, 
electric team spirit, and unwavering 
determination. 
Candidly, last night’s victory was po-
etic justice after the Major League 
Baseball commissioner caved to the 
woke left and stole the All-Star game 
from Georgia earlier this year over 
Georgia’s new election law reform that 
made it easier to vote and harder to 
cheat. 
While ill-advised political ploys fade 
away, World Series championships are 
forever. 
Chop on, Atlanta Braves. 
f 
PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL 
LEAVE 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the historic deal 
reached by the House Committee on 
Ways and Means to include paid family 
and medical leave in the Build Back 
Better Act. 
For decades, the United States has 
fallen behind the rest of the world in 
the support that we provide for work-
ing families. Without a national paid 
leave policy, families have been forced 
to make an impossible choice between 
caring for their loved ones and putting 
food on the table. 
Across the Nation, there are millions 
of Americans like my constituent, 
Tameka Henry, who has lost $200,000 in 
wages over the course of her lifetime 
while caring for her chronically ill hus-
band. Those lost wages mean lost con-
tributions to Medicare and Social Se-
curity that push working Americans 
further behind in our economy. This 
shouldn’t be a partisan issue. 
Paid leave levels the playing field for 
our small businesses and lifts up our 
entire economy. I hope that my Repub-
lican colleagues will come forward to 
help us deliver this historic change for 
the American people. But if they fail, 
make no mistake, Democrats will de-
liver for their constituents and for our 
own.

DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE 
UNBORN 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, yesterday the Supreme Court 
heard oral arguments in the Texas 
heartbeat case. 
I pray that the Justices find wisdom 
and compassion to defend the rights of 
the unborn. 
So many of my constituents were 
horrified to learn that the FDA was ac-
tually purchasing fetal tissue to sur-
gically implant baby skulls into mice. 
Thank God President Trump defended 
life and stopped this horrific practice. 
We opened this session with a prayer 
to ‘‘Creator God.’’ God is the creator of 
human life, which begins at concep-
tion. Abortion is an offense to God, and 
we are bringing the wrath of God down 
upon our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge us as law-
makers and Americans to repent and 
change course. Every child is made in 
the image of God, and every child is 
precious.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CARR 
CENTER 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the Carr Center in De-
troit, Michigan, as they celebrate 30 
years of preserving, presenting, pro-
moting, and developing African and Af-
rican-American cultural arts traditions 
in southeastern Michigan. 
Founded in 1991 as the Arts League of 
Michigan, the Carr Center has worked 
to fulfill its mission of bringing artis-
tic excellence by offering a wide array 
of programming. 
Building upon its initial creative 
placemaking, the Carr Center has be-
come a destination and hub for the per-
forming arts in the city of Detroit. 
The Carr Center has implemented 
three pillars of programming: Carr 
Center Presents, Carr Center Contem-
porary focus on performing and visual 
arts, while the Carr Center Arts Acad-
emy offers in-school and intensive 
summer arts education opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to please join me in recognizing the 
Carr Center’s many contributions to 
southeastern Michigan over the past 
three decades as we wish them well in 
the years to come. They are a true gem 
of Michigan’s 13th District.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
this Thanksgiving is expected to be the 
most expensive in history due to sky-
rocketing inflation. Americans are also 
being warned that their Christmas pre-
sents will cost more and might not ar-
rive on time due to the supply chain 
disruptions. I hope that doesn’t hap-
pen. 
President Biden’s and House Demo-
crats’ out-of-control spending policies 
are to blame for both the economic and 
supply chain woes. To make matters 
worse, they are now pushing a made-in- 
America tax, which will only drive 
businesses and jobs overseas and fur-
ther devastate our troubled economy. 
There are plenty of signs that our 
economy is significantly struggling, 
unfortunately. Most recently, the GDP 
growth decelerated to 2 percent in the 
third quarter. This is the slowest 
growth rate since the start of the pan-
demic-era recovery. Real disposable 
personal income also decreased another 
5.6 percent in the third quarter after 
decreasing a staggering 30.2 percent in 
the second quarter. 
We must reverse course and abandon 
these irresponsible policies rather than 
continuing to compound the economic 
pain. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in strong support of 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda. 
Last November, the American people 
sent us to Washington to create more 
jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for 
middle class families, and we are ready 
to deliver. 
The Build Back Better agenda will 
lower healthcare costs for families 
across my district and across the coun-
try, cut taxes for more than 35 million 
working families, and expand high- 
quality home healthcare for millions of 
older Americans and Americans with 
disabilities. 
As the President also returns from 
the U.N. Climate Change Conference in 
Glasgow, we have an opportunity to 
pass a $550 billion investment in fight-
ing climate change and transitioning 
to a green economy. 
We simply do not have time to spare. 
The American people are counting on 
us. Let’s get this done. 
f 
GIVING AMNESTY TO MILLIONS OF 
ILLEGAL ALIENS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address the Build Back 
Better bill. Earlier this week the Bor-
der Patrol announced that they had 
found 557 bodies of people who were 
trying to get into this country last 
year. That is more than double what it 
was a year ago. 
I am shocked that after finding all 
these bodies, either dehydrating in the 
heat, drowning in the Rio Grande, or 
falling off the 30-foot high fence, that 
they still are doing all they can to 
cause illegal immigration in this coun-
try. 
In particular, in this bill, you are 
still trying to give amnesty to millions 
of people, which acts as a magnet for 
people to come here. You are still try-
ing to give free college tuition to peo-
ple who come in this country illegally, 
while the middle class in this coun-
try—who you apparently don’t care 
for—goes tens of thousands of dollars 
in debt to get that degree. 
This is happening all at the time that 
President Biden is apparently negoti-
ating giving families, who try to come 
here illegally, $450,000. 
Please, majority party, give up on 
this horrible Build Back Better bill, 
which is just one more effort to trans-
form and change America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
WATSON
COLEMAN). Members are re-
minded to direct their remarks to the 
Chair.

CONGRATULATING THE ATLANTA 
BRAVES ON WINNING THE 2021 
WORLD SERIES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
and applaud the 2021 World Series 
Champions, the Atlanta Braves. I am 
enormously 
proud 
of 
the 
Atlanta 
Braves, their players, their coaches, 
and especially their fans for their de-
termination and resiliency on a long 
road to this championship title. 
The last time the Braves won the 
World Series was 1995. I can finally say 
that my Atlanta Braves are champions 
once again. With the World Series vic-
tory, the Braves completed one of his-
tory’s 
greatest 
championship 
turn-
arounds. 
Plagued by injuries to their best 
pitcher and outfielder, the Braves had 
a losing record in August. Through 
much adversity, the Braves relied on a 
number of players and others who 
helped them to regain the World Series 
title. 
As Braves fans in Georgia and around 
the world celebrate, I congratulate this 
team on a remarkable season, a 2021 
World Series title, and a place in the 
history books. 
The city and people of Atlanta, the 
great State of Georgia, and the great 
Braves nation will be forever grateful 
to the 2021 Atlanta Braves for breaking 
the curse and winning it all. 
The Atlanta Braves are the World Se-
ries champions. 
Go Braves. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to maintain proper 
decorum while in the Chamber. 
f 
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, we 
face a now-or-never moment to reverse 
the severe consequences of the climate 
crisis. Our narrow margin to avert ca-
tastrophe is shrinking, and right now, 
Democrats hold the power to enact ag-
gressive policies to turn that tide. Fail-
ing to meet the moment in the Build 
Back Better Act is frankly a non-
starter. 
In my home State of Hawaii, the dev-
astating effects of climate change are 
crystal clear. Each year, we experience 
unprecedented flooding, which causes 
landslides, washes out bridges, and cre-
ates dam failures; rising sea levels that 
lead to coastal erosion are visible 
along 
every 
island; 
and 
warming 
waters that cause widespread coral 
bleaching that kill our fish populations 
and threaten our economy. 
As we face these challenges, Hawaii 
has been a leader in green energy 
sources, including geothermal, ocean, 
solar, 
and 
hydro-energy. 
However, 
while my State can do its part, we need 
a robust national effort if we are to 
sustain our planet for future genera-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, the global climate 
crisis is our greatest national security 
threat, and I urge all my colleagues to 
answer the call to action by passing 
the Build Back Better Act.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL 
GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the National Grain and Feed Asso-
ciation as they celebrate 125 years of 
supporting every facet of the agricul-
tural value chain. 
Established as one of the first indus-
try-based arbitration systems in North 
America, NGFA has transformed Amer-
ican farmers’ bounties into safe, nutri-
tion, 
sustainable, 
and 
affordable 
human and animal food. 
The National Grain and Feed Asso-
ciation is a nonprofit trade association 
that serves more than 1,000 companies 
and 7,500 facilities. They continue to 
advocate for grain, feed, and processing 
interests of the complete value chain 
and promote the competitiveness of the 
United States of America. 
In order to recognize this great 
achievement, House Agriculture Com-
mittee Chairman DAVID SCOTT and I in-
troduced a resolution celebrating the 
125th anniversary celebrating the ef-
forts of the NGFA in transforming the 
American farmer’s bounty.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t have to tell 
you that these are partisan times. We 
don’t often get to consider something 
that is supported by both Democrats on 
the Rules Committee and Republicans 
on the Rules Committee. Not only 
that, an idea that was also rec-
ommended by the truly bipartisan Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization 
of the Congress. 
That is what we have before us with 
H. Con. Res. 44, the Fiscal State of the 
Nation Resolution. 
This measure from Congresswoman 
RICE of New York is coming before us 
at an especially important time, a time 
that finds us discussing matters like 
the debt ceiling, government spending, 
transportation, and reconciliation leg-
islation. 
It requires the director of the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to de-
liver an annual address to a joint hear-
ing of the House and Senate Budget 
Committees on the financial position 
and condition of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Members of the media would be able 
to cover the hearing so the American 
people and not just the Members of 
Congress can better understand the re-
alities about what we face today; all 
with the goal, Madam Speaker, of pro-
moting 
greater 
transparency 
sur-
rounding our Nation’s fiscal health. 
That way, we have more clarity as 
Congress makes spending decisions in 
the months and years ahead that will 
impact every single American. 
A companion measure has already 
been introduced in the United States 
Senate, since the House alone cannot 
tell our friends on the other side of the 
Capitol what to do; although, I must 
admit, sometimes I wish we could, 
Madam Speaker. 
There are more than 100 cosponsors 
of this resolution. As I said earlier, the 
Select Committee on the Moderniza-
tion of the Congress has already rec-
ommended this concept in their final 
report of the 116th Congress. I think 
that is because of a simple reason: We 
all want to make the most informed 
spending decisions and develop the 
most sensible ways to combat our debt. 
You can’t properly address these 
issues unless you fully understand 
them. With this resolution, through 
the work of the House and Senate 
Budget Committees, we can all better 
understand the fiscal reality that we 
face. 
Don’t get me wrong, Madam Speaker, 
I am sure we will still have many de-
bates on this floor about what to do in 
response. I sure as hell would never 
support anything that punishes the 
very Americans who can least afford it. 
For example, when we talk about fis-
cal health, I want us to acknowledge 
that 
America’s 
tax 
code 
rewards 
wealth and power at the expense of 
working families. There has been a dra-
matic reduction in taxes paid by the 
very rich in this country over the last 
60 years. 
So when some say all we need to do 
is cut, cut, cut, I have to say I get a lit-
tle confused. I think cutting Medicare, 
privatizing Social Security, and slash-
ing funding for important programs 
that help working families is an awful 
idea. 
Instead, I want those at the top to 
contribute their fair share and pay it

forward so everyone else can access the 
opportunities and possibilities they get 
to enjoy. 
Let me also say, taking on big prob-
lems will cost money. But in the long 
run, the consequences of an action of-
tentimes will be more expensive. Hun-
ger is an issue that I deeply care about. 
It is estimated to cost Americans over 
$160 billions every year in lost produc-
tivity and poor healthcare outcomes. 
In contrast, it would cost us just a 
fraction of that number to completely 
end hunger in America. By investing in 
solutions up front, we can often save a 
boatload of money and pass on those 
savings to the American taxpayer. 
b 1245 
Now, many Members on my side feel 
the same way. But I get it. Many of my 
Republican 
friends 
probably 
view 
things differently. We can have those 
debates here on the floor and in the rel-
evant committees. But because of this 
resolution, hopefully, Democrats and 
Republicans and Members of the House 
and Senate would at least be dealing 
with the same set of facts. 
John Adams called facts stubborn 
things, and I have to tell you, Madam 
Speaker, he was absolutely right. But 
sometimes, it can feel like each side 
uses different statistics to talk past 
each other. 
This measure will, hopefully, help 
ground our discussions about fiscal pol-
icy, so I urge all of my colleagues to 
join with the more than 100 Members of 
this body who support this resolution 
and with the Select Committee on the 
Modernization of Congress, which rec-
ommended this idea. 
Let’s allow Members of the House 
and Senate to hear directly from the 
GAO so that we can follow the facts 
and make better informed decisions 
about our Nation’s bottom line. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H. Con. Res. 44 pro-
vides for an annual joint hearing of the 
House and Senate Budget Committees 
to hear a presentation by the Comp-
troller General of the United States re-
viewing the findings of the audited fi-
nancial statement of the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
I serve both on the House Budget and 
the House Rules Committees, and I am 
an original cosponsor of this legisla-
tion. It is long past time for the con-
gressional Budget Committees to hear 
from the Comptroller General, who is 
the head of the Government Account-
ability Office. This should be done on 
an annual basis about the fiscal state 
of our Nation. 
We already hear annually from the 
executive branch through the head of 
the Office of Management and Budget. 
To complement this information, we 
should also hear an unvarnished, non-
political perspective from the head of 
Congress’ legislative support agency 
about the many factors contributing to 
the Nation’s debt and deficit in order 
to develop sound fiscal policies and 
meet our long-term debt and deficit re-
duction goals. 
Unfortunately, we are in the middle 
of a spending crisis, with well over $1 
trillion in taxpayer money spent large-
ly on partisan priorities, and the bad 
news is there is more on the way. The 
financial effect of this spending on the 
Federal Government’s balance sheet 
may not be fully realized for several 
years. It is imperative that we keep 
close tabs on how our revenues, spend-
ing, and debt level are faring. 
Congress receives information piece-
meal from the executive branch and 
from the legislative support agencies, 
so we should have a comprehensive, 
data-driven analysis and presentation 
to ensure that our fiscal policies are, in 
fact, working to ensure the financial 
health of our Nation, not just in the 
next 2-year cycle, but for decades into 
the future as well. 
While the legislation before us today 
was introduced by my Democratic col-
league from New York (Miss RICE), it is 
rooted in the Joint Select Committee 
on Budget and Appropriations Process 
Reform 
from 
the 
115th 
Congress 
chaired by my colleague from Arkansas 
(Mr. WOMACK). 
This is clearly not a partisan issue, 
as the legislation has more than 100 co-
sponsors from both parties. Financial 
success and longevity begin years be-
fore they are realized. We must not be 
reckless with our Nation’s financial fu-
ture now, and the best way to ensure 
that is to enact the Fiscal State of the 
Nation Resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H. Con. Res. 44, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from the State of Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER), who is the distin-
guished chairman of the Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair MCGOVERN for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to start 
with a bit of an embarrassing admis-
sion. For a number of years, I avoided 
stepping on a scale because I was about 
90 pounds heavier than I am now. 
Madam Speaker, eventually, I figured 
out that you can’t really get a handle 
on things by ignoring them. So, occa-
sionally, you have to step on that 
scale, and that is really the ethic that 
this bill embraces. 
It simply says that if we are going to 
get a handle on our long-term fiscal 
challenges and have an economy that 
works better for everyone, then we 
have to occasionally hear a clear state-
ment of how we are doing and a clear 
statement of the Nation’s financial re-
alities from a nonpartisan, unbiased 
source. That is what a fiscal state of 
the Nation address would do. 
As the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress looked at pro-
posals to improve the budget and ap-
propriations process in the 116th Con-
gress, all 12 members of the committee 
unanimously recommended this as an 
important reform. I would acknowledge 
that there was great bipartisan and bi-
cameral support for this notion as part 
of the Joint Select Committee on 
Budget and Appropriations Process Re-
form as well. 
The Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress believed that 
providing Members of Congress with 
access 
to 
nonpartisan 
information 
about the many factors contributing to 
the Nation’s fiscal challenges would 
allow Congress to develop sound fiscal 
policies and meet the long-term needs 
of our Nation. In its final report from 
the 116th Congress, the committee 
noted that a fiscal state of the Nation 
address would also encourage commu-
nication between the executive and 
legislative branches and improve the 
ability for all parties involved in the 
budget and appropriations process to 
make decisions based on a common set 
of facts. That is why this bill has such 
strong bipartisan support. 
I want to congratulate Congress-
woman RICE and Congressman BARR for 
their progress on this effort. I encour-
age my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to 
support this bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH), who is the re-
spected ranking member of the House 
Committee on the Budget. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Texas for yielding. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
resolution 
about the fiscal state of the Nation is 
an important step in the right direc-
tion. Now more than ever, Congress 
needs to take an honest look at govern-
ment spending and the role it is play-
ing in this inflation crisis. 
All across America, families are 
struggling. Consumer prices rose 5.4 
percent in September year over year. 
Inflation is on pace to hit the highest 
level in 40 years, and the Congressional 
Budget Office has confirmed that infla-
tion has eroded the purchasing power 
of families. 
Is it any wonder now that only 35 
percent of Americans say that the 
economy is good? I will note that is 
just a bit smaller than the 37 percent of 
Americans who believe that President 
Joe Biden is competent as President. 
Make no mistake, the high prices 
Americans are paying at the grocery 
store and at the gas pump are a direct 
result 
of 
the 
Democrats’ 
reckless 
spending agenda. So it is a little laugh-
able that my Democrat colleagues 
would bring up this resolution now 
when for the last 9 months they have 
rammed 
through 
trillions 
in 
new 
spending and debt. As we speak, they 
are trying to pass the largest tax-and- 
spending bill in the history—in the his-
tory—of our country without even a 
score from the Congressional Budget 
Office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6136 
November 3, 2021 
Here is a tip: Be honest with the 
American people about the price tag of 
your agenda and the higher prices that 
will be inflicted. Then a hearing on the 
state of our Nation’s fiscal health will 
be much more successful. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just say to the gentleman I 
would hate to hear what he would say 
if he actually opposed the bill. But the 
bottom line is the bills that we are try-
ing to move through this Chamber 
right 
now 
that 
would 
be 
trans-
formational are fully paid for. I just 
can’t be lectured by anybody who advo-
cated for a tax cut bill that benefited 
mostly the wealthy and well-off in this 
country that was not paid for at all and 
that added $2 trillion right to our debt. 
So spare me the lectures. 
I reserve the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK) in order to 
continue the lectures, and who is a val-
uable member of the Appropriations 
Committee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, my 
thanks to my colleague from Texas for 
giving me the opportunity to speak on 
this very important subject. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this resolution, though I have to admit 
that it is easy to be somewhat pessi-
mistic about its potential effective-
ness. But I am willing to try any-
thing—anything—that might work in 
elevating the Nation’s debt situation in 
the minds of the people we all rep-
resent. 
The people I represent in Arkansas 
don’t have a choice but to balance 
their checkbooks, and if they can’t, 
then they are limited in how much 
they can borrow and for what. Sadly, 
the Federal Government doesn’t play 
by the same rules. 
Madam Speaker, we are $29 trillion in 
debt. We have budget deficits as far as 
the eyes can see. We are mortgaging 
the futures of our kids and our 
grandkids. And it is painfully obvious 
to me that the governing majority 
doesn’t really care much about deficits 
and debt. But Third District Arkansans 
do. 
I had the honor of co-chairing a joint 
select committee in 2018 that tried to 
address the budget and appropriations 
process that has tripped up the Con-
gress every year since I have been here, 
and to think that we are only funded 
through the third day of December, 
with no assurance of a full year’s ap-
propriation by then, something has to 
be done. 
A fiscal state of the Union is one of 
the recommendations that came from 
our joint select committee, but I will 
remind everyone that we need three 
more—count them, three more—Demo-
crat votes to move those recommenda-
tions. And four, Madam Speaker, four 
Democrats voted ‘‘present.’’ 
So forgive me if I don’t sound ter-
ribly optimistic that Congress will get 
its act together. But maybe, just 
maybe, something like this will force a 
rational discussion before we have 
what is coming: a sovereign debt crisis. 
So, I am willing to try, and I encour-
age my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would just remind 
the gentleman this is a bipartisan bill 
put forward by a bipartisan commis-
sion, and I am glad to hear him talking 
about the debt. I wish some of my col-
leagues would have talked about it 
when they controlled the House and 
the White House, but the debt that we 
are talking about was accumulated by 
Republican Presidents and Republican 
Congresses and Democratic Presidents 
and Democratic Congresses. 
President Biden has only been in of-
fice 9 months, and the spending that he 
is proposing is to be fully paid for, with 
a recognition that we do not want to 
see an increase in our deficits and our 
debt. 
But this is a bipartisan moment, and 
we should celebrate it. But maybe I am 
sounding a little eccentric when I say 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
So, Madam Speaker, in closing, this 
legislation will provide the congres-
sional Budget Committees with an un-
biased, analytical understanding of the 
audited financial statement of the Fed-
eral Government. 
We know problems remain in com-
pleting this audit, as the Department 
of Defense has yet to receive a full fi-
nancial audit opinion. To ensure that 
this 
statutorily 
required 
audit 
is 
achieved and to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the financial health 
of the Federal Government, we cer-
tainly must pass the Fiscal State of 
the Nation Resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
the resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan 
resolution. It was presented to us by a 
bipartisan select committee. I think 
we should all appreciate this particular 
moment. 
It is about making sure that Con-
gress is provided a presentation of the 
facts about our Nation’s fiscal health 
as we make decisions that will impact 
America’s bottom line. Democrats and 
Republicans could then fight it out 
over the next steps. We have different 
priorities and different values on a lot 
of things. 
b 1300 
But there should be no disagreement 
about this resolution right now. And, 
surely, even in this day and age, we can 
all still agree on the need to get the 
facts in the light of day for us and the 
people who we represent. 
Again, I want to thank Congress-
woman RICE from New York for her 
leadership on this issue, and I want to 
thank my colleague on the Rules Com-
mittee Congressman BURGESS for co-
sponsoring 
this 
legislation. 
There 
should be no controversy over this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my legislation, H. Con. 
Res. 44, the Fiscal State of the Nation resolu-
tion. 
This resolution would require the Comp-
troller General of the United States to present 
an annual report on the fiscal health of the 
federal government to a joint hearing of the 
House and Senate Budget Committees, open 
to ALL members of Congress. 
This nonpartisan presentation will offer an 
objective analysis of the nation’s finances and 
allow Congress to demonstrate to the public 
that we are serious about improving our fiscal 
decision-making. 
As we finalize historic investments to rebuild 
our infrastructure and help families and small 
businesses recover from this pandemic, it is 
more important than ever that we act as re-
sponsible stewards of the American people’s 
tax dollars. 
Every lawmaker, citizen, and media outlet 
should be able to reference a single, unbiased 
source when discussing the current and future 
fiscal health of our country. And the Fiscal 
State of the Nation would provide that valu-
able information with transparency and accu-
racy. 
I’m incredibly proud this bipartisan resolution 
has garnered over 100 cosponsors, almost 
evenly split between Democratic and Repub-
lican members. 
I’d like to thank my friend, Representative 
ANDY BARR from Kentucky, for co-leading this 
legislation with me, and I urge its swift pas-
sage on the Floor today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and agree to the concur-
rent resolution, H. Con. Res. 44, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the concur-
rent 
resolution, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HAZARD ELIGIBILITY AND LOCAL 
PROJECTS ACT 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1917) to modify eligibility re-
quirements for certain hazard mitiga-
tion assistance programs, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1917 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

(c) 
APPLICABILITY.—This 
section 
shall 
apply to funds appropriated on or after the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
H.R. 1917. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1917, introduced and championed 
by Representative FLETCHER. The Haz-
ard Eligibility and Local Projects, or 
HELP Act, is designed to cut through 
red tape to unlock Federal assistance 
to State and local governments to com-
plete some of the most basic mitiga-
tion projects more efficiently, such as 
buyouts of flood-prone properties. It 
represents a change to the current 
law’s one-size-fits-all approach to re-
viewing projects that frequently delays 
mitigation work which will be welcome 
news to communities across my State 
in New Hampshire, and across our 
country as we deal with more frequent 
severe weather events that may require 
a Federal response. 
The National Institute of Building 
Sciences 
has 
conducted 
significant 
analysis on the return on investment 
to taxpayers for investments in mitiga-
tion. Congress, under both Democratic 
and Republican majorities, has seen fit 
to bolster investments in mitigation to 
drive down future disaster response and 
recovery costs. 
Just last week, the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee marked 
up the Resilient AMERICA Act which 
would align the calculation used to 
fund the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency’s pre-disaster mitigation 
program with the agency’s post-dis-
aster mitigation program. 
FEMA’s longest-running mitigation 
program, the Hazard Mitigation Grant 
Program, or HMGP, began in 1989 and 
provides assistance after a disaster has 
struck. While there have been more 
than $5.2 billion obligated to HMGP 
projects, more than $1 billion in HMGP 
dollars have gone unobligated and will 
return to FEMA. 
This bill will help disaster-impacted 
communities complete the land acqui-
sition and simple construction projects 
that would otherwise be categorically 
exempt from a NEPA review, stream-
lining the process with FEMA. I want 
to commend Congresswoman FLETCHER 
for her efforts to help disaster-vulner-
able communities quicken the pace of 
recoveries and mitigate against future 
events. 
I support this bill and urge my col-
leagues to do the same. I reserve the 
balance of my time.

Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 1917, the Hazard 
Eligibility and Local Projects Act. I appre-
ciate your willingness to work cooperatively 
on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that by foregoing formal 
consideration on H.R. 1917, the Committee 
on Financial Services does not waive any fu-
ture jurisdictional claims to provisions in 
this or similar legislation, and that your 
Committee will be consulted and involved on 
any matters in your Committee’s jurisdic-
tion should this legislation move forward. In 
addition, should a conference on the bill be 
necessary, I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees to any House-Senate conference 
involving provisions within this legislation 
on which the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices has a valid jurisdictional claim. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding 
this legislation, and I will ensure that our 
exchange of letters is included in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD during floor consider-
ation of H.R. 1917. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 1, 2021. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 1917, the ‘‘Hazard Eligibility 
and Local Projects Act.’’ In order to permit 
H.R. 1917 to proceed expeditiously to the 
House Floor, I agree to forgo formal consid-
eration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 1917 in light of our mutual un-
derstanding that, by foregoing formal con-
sideration of H.R. 1917 at this time, we do 
not waive any jurisdiction over the subject 
matter contained in this or similar legisla-
tion, and that our Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward with re-
gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-
risdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House-Senate 
conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion and request your support for any such 
request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD during Floor consid-
eration of H.R. 1917. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1917, the Hazard Eligibility 
and Local Projects Act. 
This bipartisan legislation will let 
communities recover from disasters 
more efficiently, and even more impor-
tantly, better prepare these commu-
nities for the next disaster. 
H.R. 1917 provides assistance for cer-
tain mitigation projects that began be-
fore the grant was applied for. Last 
Congress, the House also worked in a 
bipartisan manner to pass this very 
practical bill under suspension of the 
rules. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. 
FLETCHER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
am delighted to bring my bill, H.R. 
1917, the Hazard Eligibility and Local 
Projects, or HELP Act, to the floor 
today, 
and 
I 
thank 
Congressman 
PAPPAS, and I thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle on the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
for agreeing to move this bill forward. 
I am so proud of the HELP Act and all 
that it represents. It is bipartisan, 
commonsense, meaningful legislation, 
that was born out of a real partnership 
with local officials in my district in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6138 
November 3, 2021 
Houston that will benefit all Ameri-
cans. 
As many in this body will recall, 
Hurricane Harvey hit my district in 
Houston and the entire Texas Gulf 
Coast in August of 2017, causing great 
devastation, dropping nearly 60 inches 
of rain, claiming 68 lives, and causing 
an estimated $125 billion in damages. It 
was the second-most expensive hurri-
cane in the United States’ history. 
Members of this body responded to 
Harvey’s devastation with the speed 
and purpose we needed for our recov-
ery, passing three supplemental appro-
priations bills, sending billions of dol-
lars in aid to Texas through different 
programs. But our recovery was and 
still is slow, slower than many ex-
pected, and slower than any can afford. 
Before I was sworn into Congress, I 
met with our local officials at home to 
talk about the impediments to our re-
covery. How could we speed it up? 
Where was recovery delayed? What 
could the Federal Government do? And 
one impediment that had significant 
impact on our recovery was the process 
for the award of mitigation project 
funding from FEMA. 
Here is why. As Mr. PAPPAS noted, 
section 404 of the Stafford Act provides 
that FEMA may grant up to 75 percent 
of funds for cost-effective mitigation 
projects through the Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Program, HMGP. When States or 
municipalities 
apply 
through 
the 
HMGP program, projects, regardless of 
size or scope, require a comprehensive 
review to make sure all requirements 
of NEPA or other statutory require-
ments are met. 
Importantly, these hazard mitigation 
grants do not allow for the reimburse-
ment of costs incurred before a grant is 
approved. As a result, many areas re-
covering from disaster must wait for 
the FEMA review before purchasing 
land or starting construction on a 
project designed to mitigate damage. 
This FEMA review can go on for 
months or years at a critical time for 
decisionmaking and recovering. 
In the case of natural disasters, local 
governments need to move quickly on 
projects like land acquisition; for ex-
ample, buying land or buying out 
homes that have been damaged or 
other land acquisition projects. In 
Houston, this was true for us when we 
were looking to buy a golf course to 
create additional stormwater deten-
tion. The chief recovery officer for the 
city of Houston has told us that 
FEMA’s pre-award cost policy—that is, 
not allowing reimbursement of costs 
incurred before grant approval—is a 
limiting factor in recovery, especially 
in cases of land acquisition. 
Homeowners simply cannot afford to 
wait the months or years to make deci-
sions about whether to repair their 
homes or participate in a buyout. The 
result is not only inefficiency, but real 
hardship. 
For example, Harris County Flood 
Control District received $25 million 
from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Pro-
gram to conduct buyouts to reduce 
flood damages in areas located deep in 
the 
floodplain 
where 
structural 
projects to reduce flooding aren’t cost- 
effective. But that was nearly a year 
after Harvey. It took a year because of 
the review period required at FEMA for 
all HMGP applications. Most home-
owners simply don’t have the luxury of 
waiting a year or more to begin repairs 
or decide what to do. 
So the quicker local governments are 
able to move, the more people they can 
help and the more resources they can 
leverage. Having a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach to reviewing projects through 
the HMGP is not efficient or effective. 
It needlessly delays critical mitigation 
work. 
That is where the idea for the HELP 
Act came from. The HELP Act will 
allow land acquisition projects and 
simple construction projects that do 
not require an environmental impact 
statement under NEPA to commence 
immediately without the risk of losing 
potential Federal funds. This will allow 
State and local governments to re-
spond more quickly to the needs of 
their communities and to plan disaster 
mitigation more efficiently and effec-
tively by removing unnecessary delays 
and streamlining FEMA’s Hazard Miti-
gation Grant Program. It is simple, it 
is straightforward, and it is needed. 
At home, I continue to hear a con-
sistent concern that these Federal dis-
aster recovery projects move at a very 
slow pace. This bill addresses that and 
will be a real improvement for commu-
nities across the country. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Mr. MCCAUL, for working with me on 
this bill. Disaster mitigation is not and 
should never be a partisan issue. There 
remains much work to do to prepare 
for future storms that we know will 
come, but I am hopeful that the HELP 
Act will aid State and local govern-
ments when they do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation and help our families, busi-
nesses, and communities recover from 
disasters. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time as I 
have no additional speakers. 
In closing, H.R. 1917 benefits our 
communities by allowing them to be 
eligible for Federal disaster mitigation 
assistance for projects started prior to 
their request for assistance. I believe 
that this bill is a good bill, and I urge 
support of this bipartisan legislation. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Congresswoman FLETCH-
ER again for her leadership on this 
issue. I urge my colleagues to pass this 
commonsense piece of legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Hampshire 
(Mr. PAPPAS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1917. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

ther proceedings on this motion are

ADVANCED AIR MOBILITY COORDI-
NATION AND LEADERSHIP ACT 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1339) to require the Secretary 
of Transportation to establish an ad-
vanced air mobility interagency work-
ing group, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1339 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advanced Air 
Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ADVANCED AIR MOBILITY WORKING 
GROUP. 
(a) WORKING GROUP.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Transportation shall establish an ad-
vanced air mobility interagency working group 
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘working 
group’’). 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the working 
group established under subsection (a) shall be 
to plan and coordinate efforts related to the 
safety, operations, infrastructure, physical secu-
rity, cybersecurity, and Federal investment nec-
essary for maturation of the AAM ecosystem in 
the United States. It is critical that Government 
agencies collaborate in order to enhance United 
States leadership, develop new transportation 
options, amplify economic activity and jobs, ad-
vance environmental sustainability and new

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H.R. 
1339, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill introduced by the gentlewoman 
from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS) as well as 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES). 
Once viewed as only a figment of peo-
ple’s imagination, flying cars are now 
on the verge of becoming a reality and 
will take to the skies in no time, 
thanks to recent innovations in air-
craft and propulsion technology. Ad-
vanced air mobility, or AAM, vehicles 
have the potential to alleviate traffic 
congestion, reduce the current burden 
on surface infrastructure, create good- 
paying U.S. jobs, and provide a more 
environmentally sustainable mode of 
daily transportation. In fact, last year, 
my home State of New Hampshire be-
came the first State to safely allow 
roadable aircraft to use our roads, once 
they become certified for travel. 
But as these new aircraft emerge in 
an already complex U.S. airspace, we 
must ensure that they are safe, both 
for those on board and those on the 
ground. 
H.R. 1339, the Advanced Air Mobility 
Coordination 
and 
Leadership 
Act, 
would establish an interagency work-
ing group, bringing together the Fed-
eral Government, States and localities, 
the aerospace industry, labor unions, 
and other key stakeholders to plan and 
coordinate efforts to safely integrate 
AAM operations in our national air-
space system. 
The interagency working group’s rec-
ommendations on safety, security, and 
infrastructure needs will help support 
the deployment of this technology and 
advance U.S. leadership in this emerg-
ing global industry. This legislation 
has support from both sides of the aisle 
and the endorsement of several organi-
zations representing the U.S. aviation 
and aerospace sector. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bipar-
tisan bill, I urge my colleagues to do 
the same, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1339, the Advanced Air Mobility 
Coordination and Leadership Act. 
I want to thank the sponsors of this 
legislation for introducing this very 
important bill. The bill directs the De-
partment of Transportation to form a 
working group with other Federal 
agencies to ensure that the advanced 
air mobility industry has the Federal 
backing it needs to commence oper-
ations and to succeed. 
I recently had the opportunity to fly 
a simulated advanced air mobility, or 
AAM, flight and was very impressed 
with the technology. 
In just a few short years, we may be 
seeing multiple companies carrying 
paying passengers in highly automated 
electric vertical takeoff and landing 
aircraft. 
These operations will connect cities, 
towns, and neighborhoods all across 
the country in a very safe, quiet, and 
environmentally friendly way. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill 
and keeps the momentum going for 
American leadership in the advanced 
air mobility industry. That is why I 
support H.R. 1339, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote today. 
Madam Speaker, before I reserve, I 
also want to pay tribute to Holly 
Woodruff Lyons, our longtime Sub-
committee on Aviation staff director. 
After nearly 20 years on the com-
mittee, Holly will be retiring at the 
end of this year. 
It is hard to imagine the committee 
without Holly. Each new Republican 
chairman or ranking member has re-
ceived the same advice from their pred-
ecessor: whatever you do, make sure 
Holly stays. I am sorry to say that the 
streak has finally ended on my watch, 
but her legacy will cast a long shadow 
in these halls for years to come. 
Holly has helped shape every single 
piece of aviation legislation in the past 
two decades, and she is responsible for 
literally hundreds of provisions in law 
that have improved the lives of every-
day Americans.

H6140 
November 3, 2021 
Holly is a consummate professional 
and dedicated staffer, and we will sore-
ly miss her counsel and very much 
miss her wisdom. 
I am personally grateful for her serv-
ice to this committee, both as a pilot 
and a Member of Congress. 
I thank her so much for dedicating 
her career to aviation safety and her 
service to the American public. She 
will never be a stranger around here, 
and I hope she and Mark make the 
most of their well-earned retirements. 
I thank her for all she has done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank Mr. GRAVES 
for yielding to Mr. GRAVES. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation, and I want to 
thank our sponsor on this legislation, 
Congresswoman SHARICE
DAVIDS, for 
working with us on this. 
Congress is often the body that 
comes in and proposes legislation and 
then proposes solutions after some-
thing has happened, after something 
bad has happened. This is a different 
approach. This is Congress actually 
stepping in and being proactive. 
This is bipartisan legislation that 
recognizes the United States leads the 
world in innovation related to avia-
tion. The only way we are going to be 
able to do that, that we are going to be 
able to continue leading the world with 
these advanced technologies related to 
advanced air mobility, is by being 
proactive in this case. 
We are talking about incorporating 
innovative technology that is going to 
effect virtually every aspect of our 
lives, but integrating it into one of the 
most complex and one of the most con-
gested airspace areas in the world. This 
isn’t something we can just do over-
night once the technology is ready. 
This 
legislation 
puts 
together 
a 
working group for us to look at how 
this is going to be integrated, what 
regulations we need in place, what in-
frastructure changes we need to have 
in place in order to facilitate this. 
Madam Speaker, we can’t cede this 
technology, this innovation, to other 
countries. The United States has the 
safest, most advanced aviation system 
in the world, but we are not going to be 
able to maintain that without being 
proactive, without thinking through 
all of the integration that is going to 
result; again, whether it be infrastruc-
ture or people who want to use urban 
air mobility to fly from one city to the 
other. In my home State of Louisiana, 
flying from Baton Rouge to New Orle-
ans, as opposed to sitting in the park-
ing lot that is Interstate 10 or those 
people that want to fly from Lake 
Charles to Houston for the day, be-
cause they don’t want to live in Hous-
ton, and fly back and spend the night 
in Lake Charles. I am kidding, Texas 
friends. 
Madam Speaker, the people that 
work in the offshore industry, the abil-
ity to fly through advanced air mobil-
ity to these facilities and come back, 
doing it safer; doing it with less fuel, 
less emissions; doing it more effi-
ciently, less expensive; that is what 
this solution, this technology, poten-
tially provides for us. 
There have been studies that show 
that by 2035, this industry could em-
ploy 280,000 people, and the value of 
this industry sector could be $115 bil-
lion. 
Once again, Madam Speaker, we are 
not going to realize those benefits 
without us being proactive and facili-
tating the integration of this tech-
nology into our communities. 
Madam Speaker, even our military, 
the Department of Defense, recognizes 
the potential of eVTOL technology in 
its own operations, and that is why it 
is investing in the Agility Prime pro-
gram to help foster the AAM industry. 
The issues that we are looking at in-
clude aircraft certification, ground in-
frastructure, air traffic control, bat-
tery storage, cybersecurity, physical 
security, spectrum, and many other 
challenges. This legislation helps to 
ensure that we have solutions in place 
when the technology is ready. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank the vice chair of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, 
SHARICE DAVIDS, for her leadership and 
partnership in sponsoring the bill. I ap-
preciate the work of Ranking Member 
SAM GRAVES and Chairman DEFAZIO in 
allowing us to move this forward in a 
bipartisan manner. 
Madam Speaker, before I yield back, 
I also want to recognize one of the 
hardworking heroes and unsung heroes 
of this Congress. I want to take a few 
minutes to honor our Aviation Sub-
committee Republican staff director 
Holly Woodruff Lyons, who will be re-
tiring at the end of the year. 
Holly was raised in sunny southern 
California, and she made the inex-
plicable decision to choose to go to 
Colgate University in freezing cold Up-
state New York. I think she quickly re-
alized the error of her ways and 
transitioned to the University of San 
Diego School of Law for law school. 
She did some time in private prac-
tice, and then she began her federal 
service over 20 years ago, in 1999, where 
she followed in her father’s footsteps 
and worked for the Federal Aviation 
Administration in the Airports and En-
vironmental Law Division. 
Holly came to the Aviation Sub-
committee as counsel in May of 2002 
under 
then-Chairman 
DON
YOUNG. 
Madam Speaker, also having worked 
for the dean of the House, I also ques-
tion that decision. 
When considering whether to take 
the job, Holly wondered whether she 
was too old to start a career on Capitol 
Hill. But her first subcommittee staff 
director saw there was something spe-
cial about Holly, and he told us that 
one of the best decisions he ever made 
was recommending Holly to the com-
mittee. 
Holly became the Aviation Sub-
committee staff director in 2007, where 
she remained for most of the last 14 
years, working under Chairman Mica, 
Chairman Shuster, and now Ranking 
Member SAM GRAVES. She did, how-
ever, spend a brief time as deputy gen-
eral counsel to the full committee be-
fore returning to her rightful place in 
the subcommittee. 
She made invaluable contributions, 
as the ranking member noted, to every 
aviation legislative effort over the past 
20 years, including the Homeland Secu-
rity Act of 2002; the Vision 100—Cen-
tury Aviation Reauthorization Act; the 
Cape Town Treaty Implementation Act 
of 2004; the NTSB Reauthorization Act 
of 2006, and the Airline Safety and Fed-
eral Aviation Administration Exten-
sion Act of 2010. She served as the lead 
House negotiator on the European 
Union ETS Prohibition Act of 2011; the 
FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 
2012; the FAA Extension, Safety, and 
Security Act of 2016; and the FAA Re-
authorization Act of 2018. Recently, 
last Congress, she was also the lead 
House Republican negotiator on the 
2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act. 
In each one of these efforts, Holly has 
been a model staffer. She is profes-
sional, intelligent, conscientious, and 
hardworking. She is an excellent and 
fierce negotiator, as everyone who has 
had the pleasure of sitting on her side 
of the table, or misfortune of sitting on 
the other side of the table, knows. She 
fights for every advantage at every 
turn 
while 
remaining 
disarmingly 
pleasant and entirely unflappable. 
In 
one 
memorable 
negotiation, 
though, Holly leaned forward, made a 
circle with her fingers, and told an-
other committee in no uncertain terms 
that they had zero jurisdiction over a 
certain topic. As one former committee 
staff director is fond of saying: Holly 
plays for keeps. 
Madam Speaker, there are two kinds 
of people that work on Capitol Hill: 
Those that have been schooled by Holly 
and those that will be. 
But the reason everyone loves a good 
war story about Holly is that it con-
trasts so much with her usual person-
ally. She is friendly, kind, approach-
able, and always ready to help. She has 
been a wonderful mentor and friend to 
junior committee staff. She has almost 
singlehandedly trained and mentored 
an entire generation of transportation 
and 
aviation 
policy 
professionals. 
There is no one who has worked with or 
for Holly who can say they haven’t 
learned from her. 
Madam Speaker, we often say that 
aviation is the safest form of transpor-
tation, as though that is the way it has 
always been. When we get on a plane, 
we don’t have to think about whether 
it is safe or not because of the incred-
ible hard work of people like Holly and

what they have done over the decades. 
It is only when we look back over the 
career of someone like Holly where we 
can see how much things have changed 
for the better. Without question, avia-
tion is safer today than it has ever 
been, in no small part through the 
work of Holly Woodruff Lyons. 
We thank Holly so much for her serv-
ice to the committee, her service to 
the House of Representatives, and her 
service to the American people. Her 
work has saved lives and made this 
country a better, safer, and more pros-
perous place. We are sad to see her go, 
but we will not say goodbye. We still 
have her cellphone number. Instead, we 
will say, see you soon. We wish her and 
Mark all the best as they start this 
next chapter of their life. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, we 
thank Holly as well for her contribu-
tions to the House and to this impor-
tant issue area and wish her all best in 
her next steps. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, in closing, this legislation 
takes an important step in preparing 
the Federal Government and our com-
munities for the introduction of ad-
vanced air mobility vehicles. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this commonsense legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

broadband initiative at the Economic 
Development Administration and clar-
ify that public-private partnerships 
and 
consortiums 
are 
eligible 
for 
broadband project grant awards. 
Access to reliable high-speed internet 
is vital for participation in today’s 
workforce and economy. Whether it is 
working or learning from home, com-
municating virtually with friends and 
family, shopping online, or consulting 
with your doctor remotely, almost 
every aspect of our daily lives now re-
lies on a connection to the internet. 
Unfortunately, millions of people 
across the country still don’t have ac-
cess to high-speed internet. In my 
home State of New Hampshire, 10 per-
cent of households lack an internet 
subscription. This problem is espe-
cially prevalent in rural America. 
According to a study by the Pew Re-
search Center, almost 30 percent of 
rural Americans don’t have access to 
high-speed broadband internet services 
at home. This poses challenges for our 
small businesses, for students, for fam-
ilies. 
Passing this legislation will help our 
rural communities thrive by removing 
existing barriers to internet develop-
ment. 
EDA already has the authority to 
award grants to fund the deployment of 
broadband infrastructure in commu-
nities in most need of assistance, but 
many communities lack the financial 
and technical resources necessary to 
properly develop broadband deploy-
ment strategies. 
In 
order 
to 
effectively 
deploy 
broadband projects in the last mile, 
local communities must have the flexi-
bility to collaborate with public-pri-
vate partnerships and consortiums in 
developing these proposals. By clari-
fying that public-private partnerships 
and consortiums are eligible for EDA 
grants, H.R. 3193 ensures that commu-
nities can leverage private-sector ex-
pertise 
without 
disqualifying 
them 
from receiving assistance. 
This bill also provides grant appli-
cants with additional flexibility in fi-
nancing 
broadband 
infrastructure 
projects by clarifying that funds can be 
combined with other Federal resources 
and allowing real or personal property 
to count toward the non-Federal share 
of a project’s cost. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member for introducing this critical 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 3, 2021. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 3193, the ‘‘E-BRIDGE Act.’’ In 
order to permit H.R. 3193 to proceed expedi-
tiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo 
formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 3193 in light of our mutual un-
derstanding that, by foregoing formal con-
sideration of H.R. 3193 at this time, we do 
not waive any jurisdiction over the subject 
matter contained in this or similar legisla-
tion, and that our Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward with re-
gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-
risdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House-Senate 
conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion and request your support for any such 
request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H.R. 3193. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman.

Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 3193, the E- 
BRIDGE Act. I appreciate your willingness 
to work cooperatively on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that by foregoing formal 
consideration on H.R. 3193, the Committee 
on Financial Services does not waive any fu-
ture jurisdictional claims to provisions in 
this or similar legislation, and that your 
Committee will be consulted and involved on 
any matters in your Committee’s jurisdic-
tion should this legislation move forward. In 
addition, should a conference on the bill be 
necessary, I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees to any House-Senate conference 
involving provisions within this legislation 
on which the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices has a valid jurisdictional claim. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding 
this legislation, and I will ensure that our 
exchange of letters is included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H.R. 3193. 
Sincerely, 
PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to be the 
sponsor of H.R. 3193, the Eliminating 
Barriers to Rural Internet Develop-
ment Grant Eligibility Act, or E- 
BRIDGE, along with the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Unfortunately, too many of our com-
munities, particularly in rural Amer-
ica, 
still 
lack 
broadband 
access. 
Broadband is critical to conducting 
business and attracting jobs for tele-
health, education, and emergency pre-
paredness and response efforts in this 
digital age. 
While Economic Development Ad-
ministration, or EDA, grants may al-
ready be used to attract jobs in eco-
nomically distressed areas, there are 
hurdles to using these grants for 
broadband projects, including difficult 
last-mile efforts that often delay rural 
broadband development. This bill re-
moves those hurdles to help connect 
and revitalize our rural communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to thank Ranking Member 
GRAVES for his leadership on this im-
portant piece of legislation that would 
eliminate hurdles and leverage Eco-
nomic 
Development 
Administration 
dollars to invest in broadband deploy-
ment across America’s rural commu-
nities. 
By utilizing public-private partner-
ships and consortia between internet 
service providers and economic devel-
opment agencies, EDA dollars could be 
leveraged to deploy broadband and spur 
modern 
economic 
development 
for 
rural and economically distressed com-
munities. 
Many of these consortia exist within 
the private sector, including many 
large corporations working to deploy 
broadband across vast rural areas. 
However, EDA funds have been held 
back from small towns and commu-
nities working to attract private in-
vestment in their communities. The E- 
BRIDGE Act would directly respond to 
the needs of these communities and 
provide flexibility to leverage in-kind 
services and other Federal resources. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has dem-
onstrated the necessity of the internet 
in our lives and the need to close the 
digital divide that exists between rural 
and urban areas. This bill is supported 
by The App Association, American 
Farm Bureau, and the National Asso-
ciation of Development Organizations. 
I appreciate the chairman and rank-
ing member for bringing this legisla-
tion to the floor, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
H.R. 3193 is going to ensure that rural 
and economically distressed commu-
nities are equipped to use EDA grants 
to develop high-speed broadband ac-
cess. I feel very strongly about this 
bill, and I urge support of this impor-
tant legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member GRAVES and 
Mr. GUEST for their leadership on this 
important issue. I urge my colleagues 
to support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Hampshire 
(Mr. PAPPAS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3193, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

PRELIMINARY 
DAMAGE 
ASSESS-
MENT 
IMPROVEMENT 
ACT 
OF 
2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3709) to direct the Adminis-
trator of the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency to submit to Congress 
a report on preliminary damage assess-
ments and make necessary improve-
ments to processes in the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3709 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preliminary 
Damage Assessment Improvement Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Preliminary damage assessments play a 
critical role in assessing and validating the 
impact and magnitude of a disaster. 
(2) Through the preliminary damage as-
sessment process, representatives from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency 
validate information gathered by State and 
local officials that serves as the basis for dis-
aster assistance requests. 
(3) Various factors can impact the duration 
of a preliminary damage assessment and the 
corresponding submission of a major disaster 
request, however, the average time between 
when a disaster occurs, and the submission 
of a corresponding disaster request has been 
found to be approximately twenty days 
longer for flooding disasters. 
(4) With communities across the country 
facing increased instances of catastrophic 
flooding and other extreme weather events, 
accurate and efficient preliminary damage 
assessments have become critically impor-
tant to the relief process for impacted States 
and municipalities. 
SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency shall submit to Con-
gress a report describing the preliminary 
damage assessment process, as supported by 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
in the 5 years before the date of enactment 
of this Act. 
(b) CONTENTS.—The report described in sub-
section (a) shall contain the following: 
(1) The process of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency for deploying personnel

consistent liaison between the Agency and 
State, local, tribal, and territorial officials 
within a disaster area. 
SEC. 4. PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 6 months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency shall convene an advi-
sory panel consisting of emergency manage-
ment personnel employed by State, local, 
territorial, or tribal authorities, and the rep-
resentative organizations of such personnel 
to assist the Agency in improving critical 
components of the preliminary damage as-
sessment process. 
(b) MEMBERSHIP.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—This advisory panel shall 
consist of at least 2 representatives from na-
tional emergency management organizations 
and at least 1 representative from each of 
the 10 regions of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, selected from emer-
gency management personnel employed by 
State, local, territorial, or tribal authorities 
within each region. 
(2) INCLUSION
ON
PANEL.—To the furthest 
extent practicable, representation on the ad-
visory panel shall include emergency man-
agement personnel from both rural and 
urban jurisdictions.

form to integrate data collected by State 
and local governments with data collected 
by the Agency; and 
(C) assessing instruction materials pro-
vided by the Agency for omissions of perti-
nent information or language that conflicts 
with other statutory requirements; and 
(2) identify opportunities for streamlining 
the consideration of preliminary damage as-
sessments by the Agency, including elimi-
nating duplicative paperwork requirements 
and ensuring consistent communication and 
decision making among Agency staff. 
(d) INTERIM
REPORT.—Not later than 18 
months after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Administrator shall submit to Con-
gress a report regarding the findings of the

tion that may be necessary to implement the 
findings of the advisory panel. 
(e) RULEMAKING
AND FINAL REPORT.—Not 
later than 2 years after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Administrator shall 
issue such regulations as are necessary to 
implement the recommendations of the advi-
sory panel and submit to Congress a report

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and the

from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3709. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3709, introduced and championed 
by 
Representatives 
KATKO
and 
DELGADO, two colleagues of ours on the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. 
The 
Preliminary 
Damage 
Assess-
ment, or PDA, Improvement Act would 
direct the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency to produce a report exam-
ining the PDA process and establish a 
more consistent training regime for 
FEMA personnel to effectively support 
State and local officials as they con-
duct these assessments in the wake of 
disaster. 
FEMA uses PDA findings to deter-
mine the extent of damage and the sub-
sequent unmet needs of individuals, 
businesses, and the public sector in a 
disaster-impacted area. 
This bill will ensure greater consist-
ency of PDAs across FEMA’s 10 regions 
by creating a training program with a 
goal of ensuring a more consistent 
process of data collection and analysis. 
As communities across the country 
experience 
more 
extreme 
weather 
events, consistent and timely PDAs are 
more important than ever to the recov-
ery process. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation and ask my colleagues to do the 
same. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3709, the Preliminary Damage As-
sessment Improvement Act of 2021, in-
troduced by the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO). 
FEMA’s preliminary disaster assess-
ment is crucial when determining eligi-
bility for disaster assistance. This bill 
will ensure State and local stake-
holders are involved in reviewing and 
developing recommendations for im-
proving this process. This bill will help 
reduce unnecessary delays and get as-
sistance to disaster survivors more 
quickly so they can recover faster and 
move forward with their lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
H.R. 3709 makes disaster recovery 
easier for victims by improving State 
and local communities’ abilities to co-
ordinate with FEMA when determining 
the impacts of major disasters. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this important bipartisan legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

MODIFYING 
PURCHASE 
TREAT-
MENT 
OF 
CERTAIN 
BARGAIN- 
PRICE OPTIONS 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2220) to amend title 40, 
United States Code, to modify the 
treatment of certain bargain-price op-
tions to purchase at less than fair mar-
ket value, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2220 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON DISCOUNTED PUR-
CHASE OPTIONS. 
Section 585 of title 40, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(d) Any bargain-price option to purchase 
at less than fair market value contained in 
any lease agreement entered into on or after 
January 1, 2021, pursuant to this section may 
be exercised only to the extent specifically 
provided for in subsequent appropriation 
Acts or other Acts of Congress.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2220. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2220, intro-
duced by Representatives GUEST, WEB-
STER, and PENCE, requires the General 
Services Administration to secure con-
gressional authorization before it can 
exercise a prenegotiated purchase op-
tion in an operating lease. 
Currently, OMB rules stipulate that 
a lease cannot be scored as an oper-
ating 
lease 
if 
it 
contains 
a 
prenegotiated bargain-price purchase 
option. Operating leases allow agencies 
to budget their rent outlays annually, 
whereas capital leases require the 
agency to budget, upfront, the entire 
net present value of all rental obliga-
tions it will incur over the duration of 
the lease term. Unless GSA has full, 
upfront appropriations in hand, the 
agency must rely on operating leases 
that can be paid for year by year. 
But preventing an operating lease 
from containing a prenegotiated bar-
gain-price purchase option means that 
if GSA wants to acquire the building at 
the end of the lease, the agency must 
pay fair market value instead of being 
able to negotiate a sales price at the 
beginning of the lease. In essence, the 
Federal Government ends up paying for 
the building twice, once when it leases 
the building and once when it pur-
chases the building at the end of the 
lease at the current market rate. 
The scoring rules are designed to en-
sure that ownership risk stays with the 
lessor and that the lease isn’t a mecha-
nism by which the government fi-
nances its ownership of the property. 
But the effect is that the Federal Gov-
ernment is overpaying for buildings 
and not getting the benefit of equity 
that it has created for private-sector 
landlords. 
It is time to give GSA the flexibility 
it needs to make savvy financial deals 
for the Federal Government. I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1345 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2220, 
which would allow the General Serv-
ices Administration, or GSA, to enter 
into bargain-price purchasing agree-
ments in situations where the buying 
of Federal property is the cheaper al-
ternative to a long-term lease. 
Designed as a measure to bring free- 
market efficiency into Federal real es-
tate, H.R. 2220 would save taxpayers 
from costly, long-term lease contracts 
where bargain purchases better suit 
the situation. 
For example, the Tacoma Union Sta-
tion purchase approved by the Trans-
portation Committee earlier this year 
shows the benefits of allowing these 
bargain-price purchases. Prior to a 
scoring rule change, the GSA nego-
tiated a $1 purchase price of the facil-
ity in order to undertake necessary 
seismic and building system mod-
ernizations. 
By purchasing the property, the GSA 
will be making the needed investments 
to modernize the facility for Federal 
use while realizing a lease cost avoid-
ance of approximately $6.4 million and 
protecting American taxpayer dollars. 
This legislation provides a common-
sense correction that will continue this 
committee’s work in reducing the tax-
payers’ burden in Federal real estate. 
I appreciate the chair and ranking 
member of the committee for bringing 
this legislation to the floor and my col-
league and friend from Indiana, Con-
gressman GREG PENCE, and his office’s 
work on this issue in the previous Con-
gress. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. PENCE). 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2220. 
As a champion of this legislation last 
Congress, we must continue to work 
toward giving the GSA the ability to 
negotiate a discounted or fixed price 
option on government leases like it 
happens in the private sector. 
With our Nation’s real infrastructure 
broken, which is too often ignored by 
this Congress, I am committed to get-
ting a commonsense option like this 
one across the finish line. 
H.R. 2220 will save billions of tax-
payer 
dollars, 
reduce 
government 
waste, and free up money to invest in 
our crumbling roads and infrastruc-
ture. 
Innovative, free market solutions 
like this bill have the potential to save 
$5 billion taxpayer dollars by bringing 
fair market practices to Federal real 
estate. 
Hoosiers and all Americans deserve 
an efficient government that can meet 
our 21st century infrastructure needs. 
By passing this bill, we are enacting 
real, commonsense infrastructure leg-
islation that has bipartisan support 
across the aisle. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, in clos-
ing, H.R. 2220 ensures that the GSA is 
able to negotiate discounted purchase 
options and leases to save potentially 
billions in taxpayer dollars. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Hampshire 
(Mr. PAPPAS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2220. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6145 
November 3, 2021 
ODELL HORTON FEDERAL 
BUILDING 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 390) to redesignate the Fed-
eral building located at 167 North Main 
Street in Memphis, Tennessee as the 
‘‘Odell Horton Federal Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 390 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION. 
The Federal building located at 167 North 
Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee, com-
monly known as the ‘‘Clifford Davis and 
Odell Horton Federal Building’’, shall be 
known and designated as the ‘‘Odell Horton 
Federal Building’’. 
SEC. 2. REFERENCES. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
document, paper, or other record of the 
United States to the Federal building re-
ferred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be 
a reference to the ‘‘Odell Horton Federal 
Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 390. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Hampshire? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 390 designates 
the Federal building at 167 North Main 
Street in Memphis, Tennessee, as the 
Odell Horton Federal Building. 
The bill is sponsored by our colleague 
from Tennessee, Representative STEVE 
COHEN, and it is cosponsored by the en-
tire Tennessee congressional delega-
tion. 
Currently, the Federal building in 
downtown 
Memphis 
is 
named 
for 
Clifford Davis, a former Congressman 
who was a member of the KKK, and 
this legislation would rename the 
building in honor of Judge Odell Hor-
ton, the first Black Federal judge and 
assistant U.S. attorney in Tennessee 
since Reconstruction, who was nomi-
nated by President Jimmy Carter and 
confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1980. 
The history of America is replete 
with acts of bigotry, oppression, and 
hatred. We can’t erase it, but we can 
make sure we don’t honor it. I support 
this legislation and urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 390, which 
designates the Federal building located 
in Memphis, Tennessee, as the Odell 
Horton Federal Building. 
Judge Odell Horton served his com-
munity with great honor and great dis-
tinction. 
I thank Transportation Committee 
members Representatives COHEN
and 
BURCHETT, along with members of the 
Tennessee delegation, for their leader-
ship and bipartisan work on this bill. 
I also know that my colleagues in the 
Senate are very interested in this 
issue, and I hope that we can work to-
gether to find a resolution that works 
for both Chambers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this bill, H.R. 390, 
which would fully name the Federal 
building in Memphis for Odell Horton, 
a great jurist. Right now, it is the 
Clifford Davis-Odell Horton Federal 
Building, 
and 
this 
would 
remove 
Clifford Davis’ name from the Memphis 
Federal building. 
In one of my first acts as a Congress-
man, the first bill I passed was a bill to 
add Judge Horton’s name to the Fed-
eral building and to call it the Clifford 
Davis-Odell Horton Federal Building. I 
initially hoped to simply rename the 
building for Judge Horton, but the po-
litical will to do that was not present 
at that time. 
Now, here we are in 2021, and the po-
litical will is present, including the 
family of the late Clifford Davis, who 
we communicated with, and they sug-
gested that it should be renamed. The 
family said: ‘‘We are proud of Cliff 
Davis’ many contributions to Memphis, 
but his membership in the Klan and his 
support for Jim Crow cannot be ex-
cused.’’ 
I completely agree and believe it is 
time to ensure that all of Memphis can 
look with pride and respect at their 
Federal building and have a name for 
this great jurist who served in that 
Federal building. 
Judge Horton left a remarkable leg-
acy as the first Black Federal judge ap-
pointed since Reconstruction. Judge 
Horton also served as chief judge of the 
United States District Court for the 
Western District of Tennessee. He 
served as an assistant U.S. attorney, 
the first African-American member of 
Mayor Henry Loeb’s city administra-
tion as the head of health and hos-
pitals, and the president of LeMoyne- 
Owen College, a historic HBCU located 
in Memphis. 
Judge Horton was a man of honor 
who dedicated his life to public service 
for the betterment of west Tennessee. 
Judge Horton broke down racial bar-
riers and served the judicial system 
well. Judge Horton is long deserved in 
this individual distinction. 
I thank the entire Tennessee delega-
tion and Mr. GUEST for joining in the 
movement to pass this bill and honor 
Judge Horton in this singular manner. 
I also thank Chairman DEFAZIO, Chair-
woman TITUS, and Ranking Members 
GRAVES
and WEBSTER
for advancing 
this bill to the floor. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, in clos-
ing, it is appropriate to honor Judge 
Horton’s service to our country by 
naming this building after him. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative COHEN
for his 
sponsorship of this legislation, for the 
bipartisan support that it enjoys. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to adopt this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Hampshire 
(Mr. PAPPAS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 390. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

NORMAN YOSHIO MINETA

Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4679) to designate the Federal 
building located at 1200 New Jersey Av-
enue Southeast in Washington, DC, as 
the ‘‘Norman Yoshio Mineta Federal 
Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4679 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

November 3, 2021 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4679. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4679 names the 
Department of Transportation head-
quarters building in Washington, D.C., 
after our former colleague Norm Mi-
neta. This recognition is long overdue. 
Secretary Norm Mineta is a great 
American patriot. He, along with his 
family, suffered the grave injustice of 
being forcibly relocated and interned 
during World War II. But he was not 
bitter toward his country or his gov-
ernment. Instead, he spent his career 
serving his country by participating in 
and improving government. 
For almost 30 years, Norm rep-
resented San Jose on the city council, 
then as mayor, and then from 1975 to 
1995 as a Member of Congress. Norm 
served on the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Public Works throughout 
his two decades in Congress, and we 
served together for 7 years. Norm 
chaired the Subcommittee on Aviation, 
the Subcommittee on Surface Trans-
portation, and finally the full com-
mittee. 
Norm was a primary author of the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Ef-
ficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA, which, as 
President George H.W. Bush said dur-
ing the signing ceremony, was ‘‘the 
most important transportation bill 
since President Eisenhower started the 
interstate system 35 years ago.’’ 
Norm was also a cofounder of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus and served as its first chair. 
Norm’s skills and accomplishments 
have been widely recognized by both 
sides of the aisle. Norm was President 
Bill Clinton’s Secretary of Commerce 
and President George W. Bush’s Sec-
retary of Transportation, where he was 
the longest-serving Secretary of Trans-
portation in U.S. history, January 2001 
until July 2006. Norm was the first per-
son of Asian-Pacific descent to serve as 
Secretary of Commerce or Secretary of 
Transportation, and he was the first 
DOT Secretary to have served in a pre-
vious Cabinet position. 
Following the terrorist acts of Sep-
tember 
11, 
2001, 
Secretary 
Mineta 
worked closely with the then-chair of 
the Subcommittee on Aviation, Mr. 
Mica, and myself as ranking member to 
create the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration. 
Prior to that time, the security at 
airports was always provided by the 
lowest bidder. In fact, one of the com-
panies was owned by previous felons. 
We professionalized aviation security 
in the TSA. That agency was 65,000 em-
ployees, the largest mobilization of a 
new Federal agency since World War II. 
For his contributions to this institu-
tion, to our government, and to the 
field of transportation, Secretary Mi-
neta deserves this recognition. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4679 designates 
the U.S. Department of Transportation 
headquarters as the Norman Yoshio 
Mineta Federal Building. 
Norman Mineta served as both the 
chairman and ranking member of the 
Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure and, later, as the Sec-
retary of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. Both his work on the 
committee and as DOT Secretary dem-
onstrates his commitment to public 
service. 
Madam Speaker, I know that our col-
leagues in the Senate are also very in-
terested in this issue, and I hope that 
we can work together to find a resolu-
tion that works for both Chambers. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to 
again recognize Norman Mineta for his 
service on both the committee and the 
U.S. Department of Transportation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption 
of this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rec-
ommend this legislation to my col-
leagues for this long-overdue honor for 
the longest-serving Secretary of Trans-
portation and the only one who ever 
served previously as Secretary in an-
other part of the administration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-

Building and United States Courthouse 
located at 1125 Chapline Street in 
Wheeling, West Virginia, as the ‘‘Fred-

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4660.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4660 designates the 
Federal 
Building 
located 
at 
1125 
Chapline Street in Wheeling, West Vir-
ginia as the Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. 
Federal Building and Courthouse. This 
legislation was introduced by Congress-
man DAVID MCKINLEY of West Virginia. 
Congressman 
MCKINLEY
has 
long 
sought this designation to honor Judge 
Stamp’s career and legacy. 
Frederick P. Stamp Jr. was born in 
Wheeling, West Virginia, received a 
bachelor of arts degree from Wash-
ington and Lee University, and a law 
degree from the University of Virginia. 
He was a private in the United States 
Army from 1959 to 1960, and a first lieu-
tenant in the Army Reserves from 1960 
to 1967. After 30 years in private prac-
tice in Wheeling, from 1960 to 1990, he 
was nominated by President George 
H.W. Bush to a seat on the United 
States District Court for the Northern 
District of West Virginia, where he 
served as chief judge from 1994 to 2001. 
Judge Stamp’s service to his commu-
nity, his State, our Nation, and the ju-
dicial system is widely respected. I 
strongly support H.R. 4660, as an over-
due recognition of his service, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

Building and U.S. Courthouse located 
in Wheeling, West Virginia, as the 
Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal Build-
ing and United States Courthouse in 
honor of Judge Frederick Stamp. 
I thank my colleague from West Vir-
ginia, Mr. MCKINLEY, for his leadership 
on this bill. I know that our colleagues 
in the Senate are very interested in 
this issue, and we want to work to-
gether with them so we can resolve 
this. I hope my colleagues will support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. 
MCKINLEY). 
Mr. 
MCKINLEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for his support on 
this, as well as the ranking member on 
our side. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an 
individual who represents the very best 
of West Virginia and recognize him as 
one of our country’s most respected 
and thoughtful jurists, the Honorable 
Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. 
Judge Stamp began his tenure as a 
Federal judge when he was confirmed 
in 1990 to the United States District 
Court for the Northern District of West 
Virginia, where he would preside as 
chief judge. 
In West Virginia, Judge Stamp is 
known for his commitment to service 
above self. This is evident from his 
military service, his time spent in the 
West Virginia legislature, his work as a 
private attorney, and for his support of 
countless community organizations. He 
has been a steadfast and respected pil-
lar of West Virginia, living there his 
entire life. 
Having raised two adult children, 
Judge Stamp and his wife, Joan, are 
valued members of the Wheeling com-
munity. And Judge Stamp has already 
been honored by his selection to the 
Wheeling Hall of Fame. 
Humble to the extreme, but humble 
by nature, it is a testament to his 
character that Judge Stamp would 
never personally seek this type of rec-
ognition. But he has earned it and his 
peers would like to see that recogni-
tion for him. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud that Con-
gress is taking this opportunity to 
honor such a great American by nam-
ing the building in which Judge Stamp 
has spent the majority of his profes-
sional service and public life, the Fred-
erick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal Courthouse 
in Wheeling, West Virginia. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of 
this resolution and I thank the chair-
man for his support. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think it is 
appropriate to recognize Judge Stamp’s 
service to our country by naming this 
Federal building after him. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a long overdue 
honor for Judge Stamp. And as the 
gentleman from West Virginia said, he 
would never have sought this honor 
himself, but it is being done by Con-
gress in recognition of his great service 
to our Nation and the judiciary. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port the legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 4660. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

SEC. 3. REVIEW OF PARTICIPATION OF NICA-
RAGUA IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC- 
CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) On November 27, 2018, the President 
signed Executive Order 13851 (50 U.S.C. 1701 
note; relating to blocking property of certain 
persons contributing to the situation in 
Nicaragua), which stated that ‘‘the situation 
in Nicaragua, including the violent response 
by the Government of Nicaragua to the pro-
tests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Or-
tega regime’s systematic dismantling and 
undermining of democratic institutions and 
the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate vio-
lence and repressive tactics against civil-
ians, as well as its corruption leading to the 
destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, con-
stitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States’’. 
(2) Article 21.2 of the Dominican Republic- 
Central America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement approved by Congress under sec-
tion 101(a)(1) of the Dominican Republic-Cen-
tral 
America-United 
States 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 
4011(a)(1)) states, ‘‘Nothing in this Agree-
ment shall be construed . . . to preclude a 
Party from applying measures that it con-
siders necessary for the fulfillment of its ob-
ligations with respect to the maintenance or 
restoration of international peace or secu-
rity, or the protection of its own essential 
security interests.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should review 
the continued participation of Nicaragua in 
the Dominican Republic-Central America- 
United States Free Trade Agreement if the 
Government of Nicaragua continues to tight-
en its authoritarian rule in an attempt to 
subvert democratic elections in November 
2021 and undermine democracy and human 
rights in Nicaragua.

lowing findings:

of sanctions in response to gross and system-
atic human rights violations in Nicaragua.

well as persons and entities whose actions, 
policies or activities otherwise undermine 
democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua, 
and persons associated with them’’.

courage the Government of Canada, the Eu-
ropean Union and governments of members

ernments of countries in Latin America and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6150 
November 3, 2021 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1064. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1064, the RENACER Act. 
I thank my good friend, ALBIO SIRES 
from New Jersey, for his tireless work 
in championing this bill and continu-
ously drawing attention to the anti-
democratic actions taken by the Or-
tega regime. 
This legislation makes clear that the 
United States will not sit by quietly as 
another country in our hemisphere 
slides further away from our demo-
cratic values. Working with our friends 
and partners in the international com-
munity, this bill will allow us to con-
tinue applying pressure on the Ortega 
regime ahead of the elections later this 
month. Sadly, all signs indicate that 
these elections will be far from free 
and fair. 
Passing this bill will demonstrate the 
United States Government’s strong be-
lief that a commitment to upholding 
human rights and free expression are 
key pillars of promoting and preserving 
democracy. 
The legislation takes a number of im-
portant steps. It restricts the Ortega 
regime’s ability to access capital for 
corrupt purposes via international fi-
nancial institutions and will bolster 
transparency mechanisms to ensure 
any that funds Nicaragua receives are 
not siphoned off for illicit or illegal 
purposes. 
The RENACER Act will also ensure 
our sanctions policy is thoughtful and 
effective by focusing targeted sanc-
tions on bad actors undermining the 
rule of law and democracy and not on 
the Nicaraguan people. 
Crucially, the legislation requires the 
Secretary of State to work with part-
ners to make our sanctions multilat-
eral and even more effective. 
The RENACER Act also serves a cru-
cial factfinding purpose by including 
important reports on regime corrup-
tion, human rights abuses, arms sales, 
and Russia’s role in the country. Just 
as this bill builds on the Nicaragua 
Human Rights and Anticorruption Act 
of 2018, these report provisions will 
help Congress develop and mold addi-
tional responses should the Ortega re-
gime continue down an illiberal and 
undemocratic path. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 2, 2021. 
Hon. GREGORY MEEKS, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning S. 1064, Reinforcing Nicaragua’s Ad-
herence to Conditions for Electoral Reform 
(RENACER) Act of 2021. In order to permit S. 
1064 to proceed expeditiously to the House 
Floor, I agree to forgo formal consideration 
of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of S. 1064 in light of our mutual under-
standing that, by foregoing formal consider-
ation of S. 1064 at this time, we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that 
our Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as this or similar legisla-
tion moves forward with regard to any mat-
ters in the Committee’s jurisdiction. The 
Committee also reserves the right to seek 
appointment of an appropriate number of 
conferees to any House-Senate conference in-

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, November 2, 2021. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: I am writing 
to you concerning S. 1064, Reinforcing 
Nicaragua’s Adherence to Conditions for 
Electoral Reform (RENACER) Act of 2021. I 
appreciate your willingness to work coopera-
tively on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Financial Services under House Rule X, 
and that your Committee will forgo action 
on S. 1064 to expedite floor consideration. I 
further acknowledge that the inaction of 
your Committee with respect to the bill does 
not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I also acknowl-
edge that your Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward, and will 
support the appointment of Committee on 
Financial Services conferees during any 
House-Senate conference convened on this 
legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman.

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
legislation, the RENACER Act, that 
seeks to address the Ortega regime’s 
dismantling of Nicaragua’s democracy, 
and seeks to support freedom-loving 
Nicaraguan’s democratic aspirations. 
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this legisla-
tion should have been passed months 
ago when Congress had an opportunity 
to stop Ortega’s campaign of terror. 
The world has watched in horror as 
Nicaragua, under Daniel Ortega’s au-
thoritarian rule, has brutally consoli-
dated 
into 
one-party 
dictatorship. 
Joining the governments in Cuba and 
Venezuela, Ortega’s Nicaragua is now 
Latin America’s third socialist regime. 
On November 7, this coming Sunday, 
Nicaragua will hold a political farce 
claiming to resemble elections. Mean-
while, Daniel Ortega holds opposition 
candidates and over 140 political pris-
oners unlawfully incarcerated. This in-
cludes people like opposition student 
leader Lesther Aleman, a 23-year-old 
who cannot even walk due to the bru-
tality he has endured while illegally 
detained; or the husbands of Victoria 
Cardenas and Berta Valle. They were 
leading presidential candidates who 
planned to oppose Ortega in the next 
election, but found themselves impris-
oned in inhumane conditions and de-
prived of due process. 
I have met with these brave women 
and I admire their courage and advo-
cacy for all of Nicaragua’s unjustly de-
tained. 
I am a lead cosponsor of this bill, and 
I am grateful for the leadership of Con-
gresswoman MARIA
SALAZAR, and to 
the chairman of the Western Hemi-
sphere Subcommittee, ALBIO SIRES, for 
his 
advocacy 
of 
the 
plight 
of 
Nicaragua’s political prisoners. I great-
ly appreciate his friendship and his 
leadership. 
This bipartisan bill will require tar-
geted sanctions against corrupt regime 
officials 
who 
have 
dismantled 
Nicaragua’s 
democracy 
and 
under-
mined these elections. It will also en-
sure the United States is coordinating 
targeted sanctions with our Canadian 
and European Union allies. 
This legislation also expands over-
sight to ensure international financing 
institutions are not enriching the cor-
rupt regime while making sure there 
are humanitarian exceptions. It re-
quires a classified report on Russia’s 
nefarious 
activities 
in 
Nicaragua, 
whose intelligence and security co-
operation has dramatically expanded. 
The United States must condemn the 
electoral charade taking place on Sun-
day and urge our international part-
ners to join us. America must continue 
to be the beacon of freedom and stand 
against authoritarian socialist leaders. 
We must hold the Ortega regime ac-
countable for its atrocious and desta-
bilizing behavior. 
We only need to look at Venezuela to 
see the consequences of ignoring rising 
socialist authoritarianism. More can 
and should be done, and a positive first 
step is passing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my 
colleagues in this effort. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6151 
November 3, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SALAZAR). 
Ms. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 1064, the RENACER Act. I 
am proud to have introduced this bill 
with Congressman ALBIO SIRES, Sen-
ator 
BOB
MENENDEZ, 
and 
Senator 
MARCO RUBIO. 
For years, dictator Daniel Ortega has 
been quietly dismantling democracy in 
Nicaragua. First, he ripped the con-
stitution apart to get reelected, then 
he seized control of every branch of 
government, of the military, and of the 
police. 
Ortega wants to rule the country 
from an iron throne, and the Nica-
raguan people are suffering as a result. 
Ortega has banned political parties, 
and he has killed hundreds of Nica-
raguans and jailed hundreds more. 
Now we are on the eve of one of his 
most brazen moves in nearly 35 years 
of terrorizing this country, a sham 
election where all seven presidential 
candidates were arrested in broad day-
light; one of them being my ex-hus-
band, Arturo Cruz. This is his most fla-
grant example of a stolen election as 
we have ever seen, and the world needs 
to know that. 
His brutal regime must be held ac-
countable for its crimes against hu-
manity and for its systematic attack 
on democracy. That is why Congress 
must pass the RENACER Act now. 
RENACER increases sanctions on Or-
tega and on Ortega’s chief co-con-
spirator and vice-president, his wife, 
Rosario Murillo; and on the Nica-
raguan security forces that brutalized 
their people. 
It brings the international commu-
nities together to take down Ortega’s 
safe havens around the world, and it 
exposes the Russian meddling in that 
country. The RENACER Act sends a 
clear message to Ortega and Murillo 
that your time is up. 
I am also pleased that the provisions 
from my Nicaragua Free Trade Review 
Act were included in this critical legis-
lation. This will trigger a review of 
Nicaragua’s participation in the Cen-
tral American Free Trade Agreement, 
CAFTA. The CAFTA–DR trade agree-
ment gives Nicaragua open access to 
United States markets. To trade with 
the United States is a privilege, it is 
not a right. 
I am here to tell Ortega and Murillo, 
you murderous dictators, you treach-
erous thugs, you will no longer have a 
free pass to enrich yourselves. Tyrants 
around the world are watching. Passing 
the RENACER Act shows the con-
sequences of jailing your political op-
ponents, of oppressing your people, and 
of stealing elections. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand with those who have been beaten 
and detained. I urge my colleagues to 
stand with the Nicaraguan people. I 
urge my colleagues to take a stand 
against tyranny. 
The United States has long been the 
torch-bearer for democracy around the 
world. We must continue to carry that 
torch. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the RENACER Act. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, I would once again like 
to thank my good friends, Mr. DEUTCH, 
Mr. SIRES, and Ms. SALAZAR for leading 
this measure. I am proud to join my 
colleagues in this effort, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, RENACER is an excel-
lent piece of legislation. I thank my 
colleagues who, in a bipartisan way, 
worked together under Representative 
SIRES’ tireless leadership, and for his 
work with Senator MENENDEZ in get-
ting this bill across the finish line. 
The United States must stand for de-
mocracy. We must stand for democracy 
in Nicaragua. This legislation shows 
that we will not abdicate our responsi-
bility to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support for the RENACER Act, 
S. 1064, which seeks to hold the regime of 
Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua accountable for its 
ongoing violations of human rights and sub-
version of the rule of law and democracy in 
that country. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the companion 
bill in the House, introduced by my good friend 
and colleague from New Jersey, ALBIO SIRES, 
and I must say that today’s vote could not be 
more timely. 
For this Sunday, November 7, the Ortega 
regime will hold sham elections where those 
who 
would 
have 
legitimately 
challenged 
strongman Daniel Ortega are either in exile or 
in prison. 
Among those who have been arrested are 
Cristina Chamorro Barrios, Juan Sebastian 
Chamorro, Arturo Cruz Jr., Medardo Mairena, 
Felix Maradiaga, Miguel Mora and Noel 
Vidaurre. 
This past July I convened a hearing as co- 
chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Com-
mission entitled ‘‘The Ortega Government and 
the Human Cost of Repression in Nicaragua.’’ 
Among those who testified at the hearing 
were the wives of two of the arrested would- 
be candidates: Felix Maradiaga’s wife Berta 
Valles, and Juan Sebastian Chamorro’s wife 
Victoria Cardenas. 
These brave women gave voice to their 
husbands’ courage, and spoke on their behalf 
because they could not. 
They recounted to us the repression un-
leashed by Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario 
Murillo, who is running for Vice President. 
Berta Valles recounted to us that ‘‘For 
years, Felix has been a target of attacks by 
the Ortega regime because he speaks truth to 
power. He has been beaten, confined to 
house arrest, and threatened. For months, he 
endured 24/7 surveillance by the police. They 
have tried again and again to silence him, but 
he never stands down.’’ 
Likewise, Victoria Cardenas also told us that 
because 
her 
husband, 
Juan 
Sebastian 
Chamorro, 
dared 
to 
speak 
out 
against 
Ortega’s oppression, ‘‘the regime has also 
persecuted and harassed me and my family. 
They have brought a civil case against me, my 
sister, and my mother, which would take away 
all my mother’s assets. They have brought a 
criminal case against me, and there is an 
open warrant for my arrest. It is clear that Or-
tega is using every part of Nicaragua’s institu-
tions, including its judicial system, to not only 
persecute those who challenge the govern-
ment, but also their family members.’’ 
Ladies and Gentlemen, we must counter 
this regime of repression. 
It should be clear to all that this Sunday’s 
election, with opposition leaders in prison or in 
exile, is a sham. 
I urge all of you to support the RENACER 
Act, which among other things would apply 
targeted sanctions to advance democracy, co-
ordinate with our diplomatic partners to imple-
ment a sanctions strategy and commit the 
United States further in support of an inde-
pendent news media in Nicaragua. 
All who oppose the Ortega regime in Nica-
ragua—be they from the Democratic Left or 
the Political Right—stand united against tyr-
anny. 
Likewise, we too are unified, Republicans 
and Democrats, in opposing Ortega’s tyranny. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan 
RENACER Act, and stand with the people of 
Nicaragua. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DEUTCH) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1064. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

EXPRESSING 
SOLIDARITY 
WITH 
CUBAN 
CITIZENS

Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 760) expressing soli-
darity 
with 
Cuban 
citizens 
dem-
onstrating peacefully for fundamental

for the immediate release of arbitrarily

The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 760 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of Cu-
bans took to the streets to express their dis-
satisfaction with Cuba’s continued repres-
sion of its people, its worsening economic 
situation, and shortages of food and medi-
cine; 
Whereas these demonstrations were the 
largest protests on the island in over 25 
years, with courageous Cuban men, women,

and youth taking to the streets in cities and 
towns across the country; 
Whereas the Cuban regime arbitrarily de-
nied a request to allow a peaceful demonstra-
tion on November 15, 2021, which the orga-
nizers have specified would be ‘‘against vio-
lence, to demand that all the rights of all 
Cubans be respected, for the release of polit-
ical prisoners and for the solution of our dif-
ferences through democratic and peaceful 
means’’; 
Whereas the Cuban regime also denied an 
earlier request for protests to be held on No-
vember 20, 2021, stating that date was off- 
limits because it would conflict with ‘‘na-
tional defense day’’ and claiming without 
evidence that ‘‘subversive organizations’’ 
with links to the United States Government 
were promoting the protest; 
Whereas artists, academics, activists, and 
journalists have been long engaged in ongo-
ing protests calling for an end to Cuba’s per-
secution, censorship, arbitrary detention, 
and other human rights violations; 
Whereas 
expanded 
internet 
access 
is 
foundational for the Cuban people to be able 
to exercise their internationally recognized 
human rights of access to information and 
freedom of expression, creating opportuni-
ties for Cubans to communicate more openly 
with one another and for their voices to be 
heard around the world; 
Whereas numerous public reports and first- 
hand accounts revealed that the Cuban re-
gime deliberately blocked access to certain 
websites 
and 
messaging 
apps, 
throttled 
internet access, and launched targeted at-
tacks to disrupt the internet connections of 
private Cuban citizens; 
Whereas during the July protests, regime 
security officials physically assaulted do-
mestic and international journalists, includ-
ing Associated Press correspondent Ramon 
Espinosa, and prevented dozens of reporters 
from leaving their homes to report on the 
protests, according to the Committee to Pro-
tect Journalists; 
Whereas Cuba is among the most restric-
tive countries in the world for journalists, 
ranked 171 of 180 countries in Reporters 
Without Borders’ 2021 World Press Freedom 
Index; 
Whereas Cuban human rights groups report 
there were already at least 150 political pris-
oners in Cuba before the July 11 protests, 
and Cuba has reportedly been responsible for 
over 400 additional arrests or forced dis-
appearances since then; 
Whereas hundreds of Cubans who partici-
pated in the July protests continue to face 
unjust detention and other forms of retribu-
tion, including dozens who have been sen-
tenced in summary trials without due proc-
ess and dozens of others who remain unac-
counted for; 
Whereas United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet 
expressed concern about ‘‘the excessive force 
against demonstrators in Cuba and the ar-
rest of a large number of people, including 
journalists’’ and noted ‘‘it is particularly 
worrying that these include individuals al-
legedly held incommunicado and people 
whose whereabouts are unknown’’; 
Whereas, on July 25, 2021, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken and the foreign min-
isters of 20 countries issued a statement to 
‘‘condemn the mass arrests and detentions of 
protestors in Cuba and call on the govern-
ment to respect the universal rights and 
freedoms of the Cuban people, including the 
free flow of information to all Cubans’’; 
Whereas, on October 17, 2021, Assistant 
Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere 
Affairs Brian A. Nichols said ‘‘Denying the 
right of peaceful assembly to Cubans this 
November 15th shows the Cuban regime’s dis-
regard for the human rights and freedoms of 
its people. This and other blatant attempts 
to intimidate their citizens is a clear sign 
the regime won’t listen to what Cubans have 
to say.’’; 
Whereas over the summer, Cuba has seen 
record numbers of COVID–19 infections and 
deaths, pushing hospitals and health centers 
to near collapse; and 
Whereas basic medicines and common 
goods have become scarce throughout the 
country and economists estimate Cuba’s eco-
nomic conditions will become even worse in 
the coming months: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) expresses strong solidarity with the 
Cuban people who took to the streets 
throughout the country on July 11, 2021, and 
with those who plan to peacefully dem-
onstrate on November 15, 2021, to once again 
express their desire to live in a free country 
with self-determination; 
(2) condemns the Cuban regime’s violent 
repression of peaceful protesters and journal-
ists and its other efforts to restrict the 
Cuban people’s right to peacefully protest, 
freely express themselves, and exercise their 
other universal human rights; 
(3) calls on Cuba to end all efforts to block 
or throttle the Cuban people’s internet ac-
cess or restrict their access to certain 
websites or applications and to permit them 
to freely communicate online, including dur-
ing future demonstrations and peaceful pro-
tests; 
(4) calls on members of the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Armed Forces, the Cuban Ministry of 
the Interior, and Cuba’s National Revolu-
tionary Police Force to not arrest or detain 
peaceful protesters, provide due process to 
all individuals, and immediately release all 
political prisoners and arbitrarily detained 
individuals still in their custody; and 
(5) urges the Biden administration to— 
(A) work with Cuban activists, civil soci-
ety groups, private United States companies, 
and the international community to expand 
internet access for the Cuban people; 
(B) support the Cuban people’s inherent 
right to demonstrate peacefully in the name 
of democracy and human rights; 
(C) continue to stand behind the aspira-
tions of the Cuban people for freedom, for 
dignity, for prosperity, and the basic rights 
that they have been denied by the regime 
since 1959; 
(D) assess whether the United States can 
develop methods to allow remittances, med-
ical supplies, and other forms of support 
from the United States to directly benefit 
the Cuban people in ways that alleviate hu-
manitarian 
suffering 
without 
providing 
United States dollars to the Cuban military; 
and 
(E) rally the international community to 
join the United States in condemning human 
rights abuses and honoring the Cuban peo-
ple’s demands for freedom. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
760. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 760, introduced 
by my friend and colleague, Congress-
woman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, together 
with my friend, Congressman DIAZ- 
BALART, and chair of the Western 
Hemisphere Subcommittee, Congress-
man SIRES, supports the basic human 
rights of the Cuban people and stands 
with them in their right to peacefully 
protest their own government. 
In July, the largest protest in dec-
ades swept the island of Cuba. Activ-
ists, in turn, were beaten and jailed by 
the government. Many remain jailed. 
According to Human Rights Watch, 
many have been subjected to abuse and 
torture simply for standing up for ac-
cess to food, to medicine, to informa-
tion, and to have their rights re-
spected. 
This resolution expresses solidarity 
with the Cuban people ahead of planned 
nationwide protests for November 15. 
The organizers of these protests sought 
approval from the government, as the 
Cuban constitution allows for legiti-
mate protest. They were denied. 
We must stand with the people of 
Cuba as they exercise their right to 
free expression. We must condemn the 
violent response to peaceful protests by 
the Cuban people. That is what this 
resolution does. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for working to bring this resolution to 
the floor, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolu-
tion expressing solidarity with the 
freedom-loving Cuban citizens, con-
demning the regime’s violence against 
innocent protesters, and calling on our 
international partners to pledge sup-
port for Cuban freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my 
colleagues, 
DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, 
MARIO
DIAZ-BALART, 
and 
ALBIO SIRES for their work on this res-
olution. 
For over 60 years, Cubans have been 
held hostage by a tyrannical dictator-
ship. The Communists have bankrupted 
a beautiful country, condemning three 
generations to misery, and separating 
countless families. 
Castro’s Cuba is also a threat to re-
gional stability and security, traf-
ficking weapons to North Korea, prop-
ping up Venezuela’s cruel regime, and 
forging alliances with pariahs like Rus-
sia and China. 
The Cuban regime is a cancer that 
has metastasized throughout Latin 
America. Starting on July 11, tens of 
thousands of protestors across the is-
land demanded and pleaded for an end 
to the oppressive regime. Some were 
even waving the greatest symbol of lib-
erty known to mankind, the American 
flag. 
Since the protests began, Ranking 
Member MCCAUL has called on the ma-
jority to consider a resolution standing

in solidarity with the Cuban people; 
each time it was blocked. I am pleased 
that the leadership has finally allowed 
a measure to be considered 4 months 
after the initial protests. 
Meanwhile, the Senate unanimously 
passed a bipartisan resolution rein-
forcing Congress’ support for the pro- 
democracy movement in Cuba. As 
Members of Congress and Americans, 
we have a moral obligation to support 
them. 
The United States remains com-
mitted to democracy and respect for 
human rights in the Western Hemi-
sphere, and this resolution urges the 
international community to join us in 
these efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure and advocate for 
many Cubans who cannot speak for 
themselves. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader 
of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding and I thank 
him for his support. I want to thank 
the chairman of the committee as well 
for his agreeing to have this come to 
the floor, and I look forward to his sup-
port. 
I want to say, Mr. Speaker, I have 
talked to a lot of Members about this. 
The policies that we have regarding 
Cuba are subject to debate and subject 
to differences. While I think, Mr. 
Speaker, there are no differences— 
there are—in this Congress, that we are 
all for supporting those who seek de-
mocracy and who seek the benefits of 
freedom and who seek the welfare of 
their families associated with that 
freedom. I don’t think there is a single 
Member who wasn’t appalled by the 
way peaceful protesters in Cuba were 
brutally suppressed in July. 
b 1430 
I doubt there is anyone here who is 
not concerned that such actions will be 
repeated this month when the next pro-
tests are scheduled to occur. So this is 
a very timely resolution because it an-
ticipates that there will be another 
group of people who will have the cour-
age to stand up and to speak up on be-
half of freedom in their country. 
There was a resolution passed by the 
United States Senate on August 3, 2021, 
although it doesn’t exactly mirror our 
resolution. Frankly, our resolution is 
somewhat less specific in terms of crit-
icism and in terms of policy. 
Why? Because we wanted this to be 
about human rights. We wanted it to 
be about people who stand up for free-
dom. We wanted it to be another state-
ment of the thousands that we have 
made in countries throughout this 
globe that suppress the rights of people 
and that imprison people because they 
try to express their views. But this res-
olution that was passed in the Senate 
was sponsored by my counterpart, the 
majority whip, Mr. DURBIN; by Mr. 
KAINE from Virginia; Mr. SCHATZ from 
Hawaii; Mr. COONS from Delaware; Mr. 
BOOKER from New Jersey; Ms. CORTEZ 
MASTO from Nevada; Mr. BROWN from 
Ohio; Mr. PADILLA from California; Mr. 
WARNER
from Virginia; Mr. CARDIN 
from my own State of Maryland; Ms. 
ROSEN from Nevada; Mr. WARNOCK from 
Georgia; Mr. LUJA´ N from New Mexico, 
our former chair of the campaign com-
mittee; and Ms. HASSAN
from New 
Hampshire; along with many Repub-
licans. My point is that this was a 
unanimous consent, so everybody was 
for it. 
The vote we take on this resolution 
is a simple one. The text of the resolu-
tion is clear. It states that this House— 
all of us—stands in solidarity with Cu-
bans seeking to express themselves and 
seek a redress of grievances from their 
leaders. It affirms that the Cuban peo-
ple ought to be able to enjoy the same 
access to information and the internet 
as Americans and other free people do 
around the world. And it urges the 
Biden administration to find ways to 
promote freedom, human rights, and 
access to basic needs in Cuba. 
I believe that these are goals we can 
support overwhelmingly. I understand 
that some Members believe that the 
text of this resolution does not include 
items on policy that they would like to 
have. I certainly think that is a legiti-
mate concern, and there is no reason 
why we cannot have resolutions that 
speak to that. But this is singularly fo-
cused on the rights of people. 
John Kennedy said that we will bear 
any burden to defend any peoples who 
essentially seek freedom. That is what 
this resolution does. It is simple and 
straightforward. 
I have supported many of these poli-
cies as chairman of the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Helsinki Com-
mission, where resolution after resolu-
tion said to Soviet satellites that the 
Helsinki signature of the Russians on 
that document demanded that they ob-
serve the human rights of those folks. 
This is a similar resolution. 
I hope all Members would share my 
view that a strong, bipartisan, and 
united vote by this House will send a 
message to the people of Cuba that 
they are not alone, that the American 
people stand with those who speak out 
in peaceful protest, and that Demo-
crats and Republicans stand together 
and in support of the freedoms they 
seek. 
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this resolution. I hope that the valid 
concerns and differences Members have 
on both sides of the aisle when it comes 
to Cuba will not preclude us from 
agreeing that we ought to stand in soli-
darity with those who are seeking the 
same rights that we enjoy in this ex-
traordinary country in which we live. 
That is why I will be voting an enthusi-
astic and strong ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART). 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, to 
Ranking Member GREEN, also to my 
friend also from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) 
in particular, and to my good friend 
Congresswoman 
DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, I thank you for your leader-
ship. 
Mr. Speaker, on the 11th of July, the 
Cuban people went to the streets de-
manding one thing: freedom after 62 
years of repression. That was 4 months 
ago. Many of those who hit the streets 
were arrested, and many of those re-
main in prison in the worst possible 
conditions. Several have held hunger 
strikes to protest their unjust and 
cruel imprisonment. 
Unfortunately, there has been very 
little solidarity from the Biden admin-
istration. The administration has yet 
to even use technology available to the 
United States Government and even 
the private sector to provide internet 
so the Cuban people can communicate. 
The administration has failed to even 
support adequate funding for broad-
casting into Cuba through the Office of 
Cuba Broadcasting. 
Mr. Speaker, I fear that the adminis-
tration will use remittances or even 
humanitarian aid or other ways to prop 
up the regime. Having said that, that is 
why I am so grateful to Congress-
woman DEBBIE
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ, 
who has not given up and who has not 
stopped working to try to bring a reso-
lution to the floor. 
This resolution is a compromise. It is 
a 
compromise 
resolution, 
and 
al-
though, as you have heard before, Mr. 
Speaker, many of my colleagues and I 
would have liked a stronger resolution 
such as the one that I introduced in 
July, which, again, the House leader-
ship has refused to bring forward, this 
resolution does express solidarity with 
the Cuban people. Again, that is why I 
am so grateful to Congresswoman 
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. 
I mention her, but I also need to 
mention 
Congressman 
MCCARTHY; 
ALBIO SIRES; MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR; 
CARLOS
GIMENEZ; Mr. MARK
GREEN, 
whom I mentioned; MICHAEL MCCAUL; 
and TED DEUTCH for their solidarity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution for the cause of 
freedom and human rights in Cuba so 
that the Cuban people know that they 
are not alone and that we are with 
them. 
Again, while we would like to be 
stronger, I am grateful for those who 
have worked day in and day out to fi-
nally bring this forward. 
Patria y vida. Cuba will be free. They 
must know, and they will know, that 
they are not alone. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H. Res. 760 and in soli-
darity with the Cubans who, have over 
the past months, turned out in large 
numbers to engage in peaceful dem-
onstrations for a better future.

They did so with the full knowledge 
that they were braving an authori-
tarian regime that criminalizes dis-
sent. 
According 
to 
Amnesty 
Inter-
national’s Americas director: ‘‘In re-
sponse to the protests of 11 July, the 
Cuban authorities have applied the 
same machinery of control that they 
have used to target alternative think-
ers for decades, but now amped up to a 
scale we haven’t seen in almost 20 
years, and with new tactics, including 
the use of internet interruptions and 
online censorship to control and cover 
up the grave human rights violations 
they have committed.’’ 
These are sons and daughters, moth-
ers and fathers, husbands and wives. 
Above all, they are human beings who 
are entitled to fundamental rights de-
nied to them for far too long. 
As the House of Representatives 
takes this vote, let us stand with every 
prisoner of conscience and dissident 
facing persecution in Cuba and in every 
corner of the world. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SALAZAR). 
Ms. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member GREEN. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 760. I want to thank my col-
leagues, 
MARIO
DIAZ-BALART
and 
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, for spon-
soring this resolution denouncing the 
Cuban regime and supporting freedom 
for the people of Cuba. 
On July 11, the world watched as 
thousands of Cubans peacefully took to 
the streets calling for libertad, mean-
ing freedom or liberty. But the Castro 
thugs responded by cracking their 
heads open in the streets of Havana. 
Ever since, countless dissidents have 
been arrested, and hundreds more have 
disappeared. 
But what is encouraging is that these 
young men and women of unbelievable 
courage cannot be stopped. 
And do you know why, Mr. Speaker? 
Because their hunger to pursue free-
dom and to pursue happiness drives 
them, and that is bigger than the 
stranglehold the Castro regime has put 
on them for 60 years. Apparently, free-
dom is bigger than fear, and that is 
why, in 10 days from today, on Novem-
ber 15, these brave freedom fighters 
will flood the streets of Cuba once 
again. 
Already, the Castro repressive appa-
ratus is showing its ugly head. That is 
why we, the United States Congress, 
the seat of power in this shining city 
on a hill the whole world is watching, 
must approve this resolution today to 
express solidarity with the Cuban peo-
ple. 
We are demanding that peaceful pro-
testers be allowed to assemble without 
fear of being brutalized. We are con-
demning the heinous crimes committed 
by this tyrannical regime. We are call-
ing now on the Biden administration 
peacefully and respectfully to provide 
internet to Cuba. 
We are on the cusp of momentous 
change for that island. We are less than 
2 weeks away from another heroic dem-
onstration by the Cuban people. We are 
less than 2 weeks away from another 
violent crackdown by the regime. 
These pictures right here are evi-
dence. They came straight from Cuban 
television. Castro’s civilian gestapo, 
armed with clubs, is ready to attack 
those who will dare to shout ‘‘libertad’’ 
on the streets of Cuba because in Cuba 
protesters are brutalized, detained, and 
beaten. They are jailed and charged 
with treason because in the eyes of this 
murderous regime, free speech is a 
crime and liberty is illegal. 
This resolution from the United 
States House of Representatives will 
send a message loud and clear that we 
will always stand on the side of free-
dom, democracy, and human rights and 
that the Castro regime’s days are num-
bered. May the Lord allow for that. 
The world is watching, and it is time 
for the Cubans to be free like Ameri-
cans, like we all are. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H. Res. 760. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), 
who is a great champion for human 
rights and an outspoken champion for 
those human rights when they are vio-
lated so close to our own shores. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his leadership as well 
on human rights worldwide. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to urge 
my colleagues to support H. Res. 760. I 
authored this bipartisan resolution co- 
led by my dear friend, MARIO DIAZ- 
BALART, to send a message to the brave 
Cubans who are desperately yearning 
for freedom and legitimate self-govern-
ance: The American people are firmly 
by your side. 
The passionate human cry for self-de-
termination 
ringing 
out 
from 
the 
streets of Havana has moved this Con-
gress and achieved something beautiful 
and all too rare. It has united Demo-
crats and Republicans behind this call 
for freedom. 
Today, we are here to do something 
simple and unifying that is at the 
heart of American values: support 
human rights and freedom of expres-
sion and freedom from repression. 
Today, this body stands arm in arm 
to condemn the Cuban regime’s acts of 
repression. Together, we proclaim the 
strongest 
possible 
support 
for 
the 
Cuban people to take a courageous 
stand in the streets on November 15, as 
they did on July 11, and peacefully ex-
press their opposition to the brutality 
and dehumanization of the Cuban re-
gime. 
As representatives of the American 
people, we proudly express unyielding 
solidarity with the Cuban people who 
wish to peacefully assemble and boldly 
demand their freedom from oppression. 
The regime has all the tools of re-
pression in their possession, but the 
Cuban people are armed with truth, 
conviction, 
and 
courage. 
Dictators 
thrive on silence, lies, and fear. That is 
why the resolution before this Chamber 
today is so important. This body must 
use our platform to shed light on the 
tyranny that casts a shadow over such 
a beautiful island. 
The Cuban regime’s deception, re-
pression, and arbitrary imprisonment 
of citizens, activists, and artists can-
not withstand the people’s demands for 
freedom, agency, and accountability. 
b 1445 
By passing this resolution today, we 
will make sure the Cuban people’s calls 
for freedom are not silenced. Instead, 
we will amplify them as we are here 
this afternoon. 
And we are not alone. In adopting 
this resolution, we will join with the 
European Parliament who adopted a 
resolution earlier this summer that 
condemns the Cuban regime’s blatant 
disregard for human rights. 
Now we too must loudly proclaim 
that this Congress stands for democ-
racy and denounces the unaccountable 
corruption 
clinging 
to 
power 
just 
across the Straits of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take one mo-
ment to thank all of those, including 
President Biden, and especially Presi-
dent Biden, for standing with the 
Cuban people; for standing up for free-
dom, for free and fair elections on the 
island, for freedom of expression, and 
for making sure that we can help hold 
this unaccountable regime account-
able. 
I also want to thank those who 
helped deliver this message today, my 
good friends: ALBIO SIRES, MARIO DIAZ- 
BALART, and, of course, Leader HOYER. 
And I also want to thank Chairman 
MEEKS for working with me on this res-
olution as well and my colleagues from 
Florida. Without their hard work and 
the efforts of many other allies of 
Cuban democracy, we could not send 
this 
powerful, 
bipartisan 
message 
today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, make no mistake. We are 
united today around the Cuban people’s 
fight for libertad and patria y vida. 
I ask all Members to embrace the 
unifying principles in this resolution 
which avoids the policy arguments and 
expresses our support for basic human 
rights. Who could be against that? 
I urge all of my colleagues to stand 
behind and side by side with the Cuban 
people and support their pursuit of lib-
erty and justice. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
H. Res. 760. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I

me just say I, too, support the basic 
rights of the Cuban people, the basic 
human rights of the Cuban people. As 
an African American who has engaged 
in many protests for justice, I know 
the impact of keeping government and 
police forces from interfering in our ac-
tions for our basic rights. 
We should not excuse the Cuban Gov-
ernment for limiting their own people’s 
freedom and opportunity. But let me 
just say: Here in Congress, we need to 
also take a hard look at the failed U.S. 
policy that has not helped the Cuban 
people and too often inflicted harm on 
them. They say insanity is doing the 
same thing over and over again expect-
ing a different result. Well, for 60 years 
we have been squeezing the Cuban peo-
ple thinking that if we starve them 
just enough it will somehow lead to de-
mocracy. 
So it is long overdue to support poli-
cies that truly help the Cuban people. 
The Obama administration showed us 
that we can take a new approach. That 
is through engagement, diplomacy, 
trade, travel, and, yes, support for 
human rights for the Cuban people. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
oppose this resolution on the suspen-
sion calendar today and we should have 
an honest debate about a new Cuban 
policy that talks about and supports 
what real human rights for the Cuban 
people mean. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Representative TED 
DEUTCH and my colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in soli-
darity with the people of Cuba who de-
serve the right to stand up peacefully 
for freedom and basic human rights 
without fear of repercussions. 
This summer, as my colleagues have 
already described, thousands of Cubans 
took to the streets peacefully to raise 
their voices for basics like food, and 
medicine, access to the internet, for 
freedom and opportunity in their coun-
try. And what was the response by 
their Cuban Government? Violence and 
arrests and detention without due 
process of hundreds of the protesters. 
Here is what I think we can all agree 
with: the ability to speak freely, to rise 
and protest our fundamental human 
rights that everyone deserves, no mat-
ter where they live in the world, and 
that is whether you are marching here 
in Washington, or in south Florida, or 
on the streets of Havana. We must con-
tinue to support and stand up for those 
who are standing up for fundamental 
freedoms. And we must condemn the 
acts of violence and undue repercus-
sions against people for exercising 
these rights. 
So today, by passing this important 
resolution, we take a stand and we 
shine a spotlight on these blatant at-
tacks on human rights in Cuba by con-
demning the acts. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I just join those in con-
demning the acts of repression by the 
Cuban regime and call for the imme-
diate release of Cuban citizens arbi-
trarily detained. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this resolution. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Mr. DEUTCH for yielding and 
for his strong leadership on this issue, 
and I certainly want to thank my 
classmate, Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ, 
for bringing this bill to the floor, plus 
all of the Members in a bipartisan way, 
I thank them so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my sol-
idarity with the Cuban people who 
have exercised their human rights to 
peacefully demonstrate for their right-
ful freedoms and their liberty, their 
libertad. This past July thousands of 
Cuban citizens took to the streets and 
in 
unison, 
they 
chanted: 
libertad, 
libertad—liberty, liberty. 
They protested for freedom. They 
protested for liberty. They protested 
for 
vida—life—and 
for 
patria—also 
country. They wanted a change after 
more than six decades of authoritarian 
rule. 
Demonstrators were shown waving 
American flags symbolizing the liberty 
that they so desperately want. One pro-
tester remarked to the press: It felt so 
good to finally be able to protest in our 
country. It is only human to feel fear, 
but that moved to the background be-
cause you knew that we were doing the 
right thing. The Cuban Government re-
acted to such demonstrations with un-
just imprisonment of hundreds of pro-
testers, and, of course, they cut off peo-
ple’s access to the internet as part of 
the government’s crackdown. 
In closing, the people of Cuba deserve 
the right to protest. They have the 
right to have freedom—libertad—patria 
y vida. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that we support 
this legislation and pass this. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. CRIST). 
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative DEUTCH for yielding. 
In recent years, the living conditions 
for the Cuban people have deteriorated 
rapidly. Shortages of basic goods like 
food, medicine, even hygienic products 
like diapers, have become the norm. 
Socialism and communism have truly 
failed. The economy has collapsed and 
in order to maintain power, leaders 
have only tightened their stranglehold 
on the people. 
The Cuban people have responded. 
This past summer we witnessed his-
tory. Cubans from all walks of life 
peacefully took to the streets demand-
ing reform and freedom. They were met 
with violence. Since then, demonstra-
tors have been rounded up, and show 
trials, arbitrary detentions, and crack-
downs on thought and speech have fol-
lowed. Activists are still missing and 
have not been seen for months. Our 
hearts are with the Cuban exile com-
munity, nearly 1.6 million in Florida 
alone, including many second- and 
third-generation Floridians. 
They call America home because 
they cannot call Cuba home due to the 
violent, Communist dictatorship. This 
resolution is an important statement 
by the people’s House that we will not 
stand by while Cubans suffer and die. 
And we will lead the international 
community in holding the Communist 
regime accountable. Please vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, the peo-
ple of Florida stand with the people of 
Cuba. 
I am pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS), another colleague from Flor-
ida. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, during 
his inaugural address in 1960, President 
Kennedy said these words: ‘‘Let every 
nation know . . . that we shall pay any 
price, bear any burden, meet any hard-
ship, support any friend, oppose any foe 
to assure the survival and the success 
of liberty.’’ 
We know what freedom means in 
America. It is the lifeline of our Na-
tion. The people of Cuba have cried out 
for freedom, and because of who we are, 
America must answer the call. 
The failed socialist regime in Cuba 
has delivered tyranny instead of free-
dom, poverty instead of prosperity, and 
violence to silence its own people in-
stead of protection and safety. We de-
nounce that regime and we stand with 
the people because we stand for free-
dom. 
One protester said this: ‘‘It’s only 
human to feel fear but that moved to 
the background because you knew you 
were doing the right thing.’’ 
I say to America, this statement 
should be familiar to all of us. We will 
not stay neutral for neutrality helps 
the oppressor, never the oppressed. De-
mocracy and a free economy are the 
right path forward for Cuba. 
We stand today and we support this 
resolution so that every Cuban, like 
every American and every Floridian, 
will know that they have a God-given 
right to safety, liberty, and the right 
to freely choose their own future. To-
gether we stand. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY), 
my colleague. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of this bi-
partisan resolution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6156 
November 3, 2021 
This resolution honors the Cuban 
people who have protested peacefully 
at great personal risk for their funda-
mental freedoms and a brighter future 
for their families. These are men and 
women of courage and character, con-
fronting a ruthless and repressive re-
gime. 
Our resolution sends these patriots a 
simple message: America has your 
back. 
I feel a deep sense of solidarity with 
the Cuban people. When I was a baby, 
my family fled a Communist country, 
and like many Cuban families, we 
found refuge and opportunity in Amer-
ica. And like so many Cuban Ameri-
cans, I never take for granted the 
rights I am afforded in this country be-
cause I know what the alternative 
looks like. 
Following the historic protests in 
Cuba, I offered a bipartisan amendment 
to an appropriations bill that would 
have increased funding to support de-
mocracy, human rights, political pris-
oners, and internet access in Cuba. To 
my grave disappointment, this amend-
ment was prevented from coming to 
the floor of the House by members of 
my own party. 
America must speak and act with 
moral clarity. We should support men 
and women standing up to authori-
tarian regimes across the globe, and es-
pecially in our shared neighborhood. I 
urge support for this bill. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, let it be 
known, just 90 miles off the coast of 
our State of Florida is a murderous, so-
cialist dictatorship that is murdering 
and crushing its people. Let it also be 
known across this Nation that Demo-
crats and Republicans are coming to-
gether today to express solidarity with 
Cuban citizens demonstrating peace-
fully for fundamental freedoms and de-
mocracy. 
We saw it this summer when they 
took to the streets on the island as 
well as across our country including in 
Orlando. I was proud to stand in soli-
darity. Resolutions expressing support 
are important, but so is action, which 
is why, after this is done, we need to 
pursue other, more substantive policies 
like: stopping enslavement of Cuban 
doctors, putting more pressure for 
internet access on the island; address-
ing Havana syndrome and the attack 
on our diplomats, sanctions and U.N. 
action to stop even some of our own 
U.N. European allies from continuing 
to prop up this dictatorship. That will 
make a big difference. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, before we 
vote on this, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), the 
driving force behind this. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Libertad para Cuba. Patria y vida. 
(English translation of Spanish is as 
follows: Freedom for Cuba. Country 
and life.) 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I would like to first associate myself 
with the comments that the majority 
leader made at the beginning of his 
comments, where he described a sig-
nificant overlap, a place here where 
both parties can come together to sup-
port this resolution. We all agree on 
the importance of human rights. 
I am hopeful a dialogue on the policy 
differences that he mentioned occurs 
soon. 
The 
shift 
toward 
authoritarianism in Latin America 
continues, and I believe most of this 
body recognizes Cuba’s hand in all of 
that. 
Patria y vida. Cuba libre. 
(English translation of Spanish is as 
follows: Country and life. Free Cuba.) 
Once again, I want to thank my 
friends, Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, Mr. 
DIAZ-BALART, and Mr. SIRES, for lead-
ing this measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
GREEN, 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ
and Mr. DIAZ- 
BALART, as well as our good friend Mr. 
SIRES, all of them, for their bipartisan 
leadership of this important resolution. 
I want to thank Senator MENENDEZ and 
Senator RUBIO for the same. 
We have the opportunity today here, 
at this moment, to show unequivocally 
that the United States stands with the 
people of Cuba, that we stand with 
them in their desire for basic rights, 
that we want to see relations between 
the United States and the Cuban people 
flourish, that we support today and 
will always support the Cuban people 
in their pursuit of freedom, the right to 
free expression, and the right to live 
and be free. 
I thank the bill sponsors for their im-
portant work on this resolution. I urge 
all of my colleagues to stand for 
human rights, to stand with the people 
of Cuba, and to support this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DEUTCH) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 760. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f

AD-
HERENCE TO CONDITIONS FOR 
ELECTORAL REFORM ACT OF 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-

tion to suspend the rules and pass the

fair, and transparent elections in Nica-

PROTECT OLDER JOB APPLICANTS 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 3992) to amend the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 
1967 to prohibit employers from lim-
iting, segregating, or classifying appli-
cants for employment, and ask for its 
immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, in lieu of 
the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, print-
ed in the bill, an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute consisting of the 
text of Rules Committee Print 117–14 is 
adopted and the bill, as amended, is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 3992 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect Older 
Job Applicants Act of 2021’’ or ‘‘POJA Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST LIMITING, SEGRE-
GATING, 
OR 
CLASSIFYING 
APPLI-
CANTS FOR EMPLOYMENT. 
Section 4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 623(a)(2)) is 
amended— 
(1) by inserting ‘‘or applicants for employ-
ment’’ after ‘‘employees’’, and 
(2) by inserting ‘‘or as an applicant for em-
ployment’’ after ‘‘employee’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) and the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 3992, 
the Protect Older Job Applicants Act 
of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Protect Older Job Applicants Act of 
2021. 
Protecting all workers from work-
place discrimination is of the utmost 
importance. 
Unfortunately, 
older 
workers have disproportionately been 
affected by the COVID–19 pandemic 
with more workers over the age of 65 
leaving the workforce in 2020 than in 
any year over the last six decades. 
The Protect Older Job Applicants 
Act of 2021 would help address discrimi-
nation older workers face in the hiring 
process, and it is an especially impor-
tant step toward helping older workers 
reenter the workforce as the Nation re-
covers from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Currently, the disparate impact pro-
vision in the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act, the ADEA, covers 
older employees seeking relief from age 
discrimination, but not older job appli-
cants. The bill we are considering 
today would clarify the disparate im-
pact provision and make clear that 
older job applicants, not just older em-
ployees, are protected. 
This bill is a commonsense fix to the 
ADEA that would help protect workers 
from ageist hiring practices. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a Statement of Administrative Policy 
in support of H.R. 3992, the Protect 
Older Job Applicants Act of 2021. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3992—PROTECT OLDER JOB APPLICANTS ACT 
OF 2021—REP. GARCIA, D–TX, AND 62 COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of the Protect Older Job Applicants 
(POJA) Act of 2021. The legislation would 
amend the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act (ADEA) of 1967, which prohibits, 
among other actions, age-based discrimina-
tion in hiring, to specifically prohibit em-
ployers 
from 
limiting, 
segregating, 
or 
classifying job applicants on the basis of age. 
The POJA Act of 2021 provides a critical 
clarification to support older Americans dur-
ing recruitment and hiring, ensuring the 
ADEA’s nondiscrimination protections ex-
tend fully to older job applicants. 
Workplace age discrimination, including at 
the application stage, prevents people from 
fully accessing the American dream and lim-
its the contributions that they can make to 
our shared prosperity. Ensuring equitable ac-
cess to employment is a priority for the Ad-
ministration. The Administration supports 
this legislation that protects older job appli-
cants. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 3992, the more appro-
priately named profiting off of older 
job applicants act. 
This, like so many other Democrat 
proposals, is a trial lawyer payout dis-
guised as a win for older workers. 
Democrats are addicted to inventing 
problems that fit their slanted nar-
rative of American life. To liberal 
Democrats, older workers are vulner-
able employees who can’t cut it in the 
modern economy, and that could not be 
further from the truth. In fact, employ-
ment for workers ages 65 and older tri-
pled from 1988 to 2018, the last 30 years, 
while employment for younger workers 
only grew by a third. 
During that same time, the number 
of workers aged 75 and older nearly 
quadrupled. Despite what Democrats 
may have you believe, there are several 
existing laws already protecting Amer-
icans of all ages against discrimination 
in the workplace. 
One of those legal protections which 
today’s bill would amend is the Age 
Discrimination and Employment Act of 
1967, or the ADEA. It prohibits employ-
ment discrimination based on age for 
job applicants and employees at least 
40 years old and up, as it should. Dis-
crimination is wrong. It is immoral, 
and it must be vigilantly addressed. 
But this bill radically expands the 
definition of discrimination against

older job applicants by authorizing 
claims against a disparate impact the-
ory; again, what happens, not what is 
intended by the employers. This need-
lessly interferes with employers’ rou-
tine recruitment and hiring practices. 
The ADEA already prohibits dis-
crimination against job applicants, but 
the ADEA does not authorize disparate 
impact claims by job applicants. 
Congress has long recognized that ad-
dressing different forms of discrimina-
tion require different laws. For exam-
ple, Congress did not include age in the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 but passed a 
separate and distinct law in 1967 pro-
hibiting 
age 
discrimination; 
once 
again, the ADEA. 
Yet, H.R. 3992, this bill, abandons 
congressional precedence and impru-
dently allows disparate impact claims 
by job applicants under the ADEA. The 
most destructive impact of this bill 
would be the assault on existing pro-
grams that employers are using all 
across the country which creates job 
opportunities for workers, students, 
and prospective employees. 
b 1645 
Under this bill, routine recruiting ef-
forts at high schools, Job Corps cen-
ters, and colleges, including job fairs, 
would be legally suspect because these 
students are typically younger, on av-
erage. 
In addition, simply posting a job 
opening on a job search website could 
land an employer in a world of trouble 
because users of those websites tend to 
be younger. 
Apprenticeship and internship pro-
grams would also be threatened be-
cause the participants tend to be 
younger, and employers tend to hire 
full-time employees from these pro-
grams. 
These examples are not mere specu-
lation. The AARP, one of the Demo-
crats’ favorite big donors, has already 
backed class action litigation chal-
lenging college recruitment as vio-
lating the ADEA. 
If this bill is enacted into law, a tsu-
nami of lawsuits attacking these valu-
able and effective programs would fol-
low, putting millions of job opportuni-
ties in jeopardy and forcing employers 
into court to defend them. But that is 
what our friends across the aisle seem 
to want. 
Endangering hiring practices, when 
there are over 10 million unfilled jobs, 
flies in the face of common sense and 
good governance. Surely, my Democrat 
colleagues know better. 
They should also be aware of their 
own hypocrisy, as I can assure you that 
every Member of Congress has re-
cruited from colleges, universities, or 
on job search sites to fill staff and in-
tern positions, the vast majority of 
which have been hires of younger age. 
By failing to hold even a single hear-
ing on this bill and refusing to adopt 
any commonsense Republican amend-
ments, Democrats exposed their true 
intentions, to rush through yet another 
piece of misguided legislation to ap-
pease the left. 
Additionally, Democrats refused to 
allow floor debate on commonsense 
amendments offered by Republicans to 
protect job opportunities for workers 
and determine whether the bill is even 
necessary. 
For example, Representative MILLER- 
MEEKS
submitted an amendment to 
make sure the bill does not prohibit an 
employer from recruiting or inter-
viewing 
students 
attending 
high 
schools, Job Corps centers, colleges, or 
universities. 
Representative ALLEN submitted an 
amendment to ensure the bill does not 
prohibit employers from operating ap-
prenticeship or internship programs, 
and Representative LETLOW submitted 
an amendment to protect employers’ 
ability to post job openings on job 
search websites. 
If this were truly about crafting 
high-quality legislation that protects 
older job applicants, then this bill’s 
sponsors should have been clamoring 
for a thorough and bipartisan analysis 
of this bill. 
This legislation was first introduced 
in June of this year and considered by 
the committee only a month later. 
Now, we are here debating it on the 
floor without any meaningful review. 
Because H.R. 3992 was rushed through 
the legislative process, we cannot even 
begin to understand its sweeping and 
unintended consequences. But what we 
do know about this bill should concern 
every Member of this body. 
The profiting off older job applicants 
act will jeopardize job opportunities 
for millions of Americans, both young 
and old, and will make the Democrats’ 
trial lawyer friends yet richer, once 
again. 
Congress and the Supreme Court 
have long recognized that different 
forms of discrimination require dif-
ferent legal solutions. This bill aban-
dons that precedent and will not only 
set off a slew of legal challenges, but it 
will also hamstring our job creators at-
tempting to rebuild during a once-in-a- 
century pandemic and inflation crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this misguided legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct 
the record on a couple of points. In 
fact, the committee did have a hearing 
on this subject on March 18, 2021, in the 
Subcommittee of Civil Rights and 
Human Services. It was a hearing 
called ‘‘Fighting for Fairness: Exam-
ining Legislation to Confront Work-
place Discrimination.’’ 
Additionally, my colleague’s argu-
ment simply misstates the law with re-
gard to places like college campuses or 
online recruitment. For example, em-
ployers will always have the freedom 
to choose the time, place, and manner 
in which they recruit. Whether it be on 
a college campus or LinkedIn, employ-
ers face no risk of liability if they can 
show it was based on reasonable factors 
other than age, such as a larger pool of 
highly trained individuals from which 
to recruit. 
The 
argument 
that 
anyone 
who 
wasn’t available to be recruited on 
LinkedIn or enrolled in college would 
be able to sue an employer for age dis-
crimination is a misunderstanding of 
this law, Mr. Speaker. 
Finally, Title VII has outlawed dis-
parate impact discrimination since 
1972. If there are any doubts that these 
sorts of laws would wipe out recruiting 
practices, we would have seen those 
consequences. In fact, this law is to 
correct a couple of circuits that have 
gone a different way from the rest of 
the country. In 9 out of 11 circuits, it is 
already the law. So any parade of 
horribles that my colleague is sug-
gesting, we would have seen that al-
ready and we have not. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), 
the sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3992, the 
Protecting Older Job Applicants Act of 
2021. 
I want to start by thanking my Re-
publican co-lead on this bill, the dean 
of the House, Congressman DON YOUNG 
of Alaska. I also want to thank Chair-
man BOBBY SCOTT, my Democratic co- 
lead, for his tireless leadership to pro-
tect all workers, but especially older 
workers and older jobseekers. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will fix a loop-
hole in current law that fails to protect 
older job applicants during the hiring 
process. 
Despite what many people assume, 
older job applicants are not protected 
under the current Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act protections, com-
monly called ADEA. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill seeks to fix 
this. This bill would allow older job ap-
plicants to bring claims for disparate 
impact discrimination hiring against 
employers. 
While that may sound like legal tech-
nicalities and legal mumbo-jumbo to 
some people watching back home, Mr. 
Speaker, disparate impact claims are 
very, very important. They are impor-
tant because some hiring practices 
might seem age-neutral on their face, 
but they actually impact job appli-
cants that are older disproportion-
ately. 
The bill would clarify the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act to 
give job applicants the right to bring 
these claims forward. Three-fourths of 
workers age 45 and older blame age dis-
crimination for their lack of con-
fidence in finding a new job. 
But it is not just simple statistics. It 
is about real people and real stories. 
It is like one of my neighbors, an en-
gineer who can’t find meaningful work 
after losing his job. He is about 60, but 
he is always told he is too experienced 
and overqualified. But he says it is all 
about his age. 
It is about Rebecca in California, who 
is age 75, forced to provide her birth

date on a web-based job application 
where the year of her birth isn’t even 
an option on a drop-down menu for the 
birth year. So she can’t even apply, be-
cause the options don’t include the 
year of her birth. 
It is like Carolyn in Tennessee, age 
52. She was let go from her job in 
March of last year. She has filed 65 job 
applications but gotten zero inter-
views. She has a BS in business finance 
and an MA in educational administra-
tion. She says people half her age are 
getting those jobs instead. She was 
told she needed more recent, relevant 
experience. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article sharing Carolyn’s story enti-
tled ‘‘Older job seekers find experience, 
education may not be enough in pan-
demic.’’ 
[From NewsChannel5 Nashville, Jan. 12, 2021] 
OLDER JOB SEEKERS FIND EXPERIENCE, 
EDUCATION MAY NOT BE ENOUGH IN PANDEMIC 
(By Levi Ismail) 
NASHVILLE, TENN. (WTVF).—Older workers 
are having trouble making it back into the 
workforce and studies show it’s part of a 
trend we haven’t seen in nearly 50 years. 
In the first six months of the pandemic, 
older workers (55 and older) were 17 percent 
more likely to become unemployed than 
their slightly younger peers. 
Carolyn McKeown is 52 years old, but says 
she hasn’t had much luck finding a job in the 
nearly one year it’s been since she was let go 
back in March 2020. She first reached out to 
us in September and since then, she’s filed 65 
applications with zero interviews. It’s just 
finding the right time and the right place,’’ 
McKeown said. 
McKeown has a Bachelor’s degree in busi-
ness and finance, as well as a Master’s degree 
in educational administration. For decades 
she’s worked in HR, insurance, and mortgage 
lending, which she thought could be a valu-
able experience to any prospective employer. 
When jobs continued to turn her down, she 
began surveying anyone who made the time 
to listen. McKeown asked how these people 
half her age were getting jobs and many of 
them explained that it was simply an option 
right out of school. 
‘‘I feel as though we’re being scrutinized 
more heavily and told that we need recent 
relevant experience, as though we’ve never 
worked before,’’ McKeown said: 
The US Census Bureau found that for the 
first time in nearly 50 years, jobseekers (55 
and older) are facing higher rates of unem-
ployment than those a few years younger. 
They also found that older workers stayed 
unemployed 
longer. 
Tennessee 
Dept. 
of 
Labor & Workforce Development explains 
how it works. 
‘‘This program right here can help a senior 
make themselves more marketable or maybe 
upgrade an existing skill or teach them an 
entirely new skill,’’ Cannon said. 
Cannon explains that these may not all be 
full-time jobs, but they are jobs capable of 
helping someone earn an income at a time 
where the money is tight. 
McKeown is at the point where she’s barely 
managing to pay her bills. She’s tapped out 
her savings and can no longer afford health 
insurance. Not unlike the many other older 
workers who now can’t imagine the idea of 
voluntary retirement. 
That said, she’s not looking for anything 
part-time or without benefits. She acknowl-
edges that some of her qualifiers may keep 
her from getting certain jobs, but McKeown 
says she knows her worth. Under a much dif-
ferent time, her credentials could have land-
ed her a high-paying job with benefits. She’s 
not expecting the same pay as before, but 
McKeown says she should be afforded similar 
opportunities she knows are out there. 
For McKeown, she knows some employers 
think it’s too expensive to train an older 
worker in this more virtual workforce. She 
says she’s learning every day how to keep up, 
so this stigma that older workers are some-
how less capable is the only thing outdated. 
‘‘How do they determine what the job ap-
plicant is lacking. A job gap doesn’t mean 
you lack the skills. It just means you’re 
lacking time,’’ McKeown said. 
WHAT IS THE REBOUND? 
As Middle Tennessee works to rebound 
from the impact of the Coronavirus, we want 
to help. Whether it’s getting back to work, 
making ends meet during this uncertain 
time, or managing the pressure, we’re com-
mitted to finding solution. In addition, we 
want to tell your stories of hope, inspiration, 
and creativity as Middle Tennessee starts to 
rebound. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
another story. Diana, age 53, was forced 
to take early retirement after her com-
pany downsized. She wasn’t ready to 
quit working, but she hasn’t found a 
job. 
The loaded question in the applica-
tion, she says, is always: When did you 
graduate from high school? This ques-
tion tells her age. Because of that, she 
has gotten no interviews. 
These folks are not alone. I want to 
read some comments from other job-
seekers in their 50s about their experi-
ence job hunting: 
‘‘No jobs for older people.’’ 
‘‘Jobs for seniors 60 plus who still 
want to work are not so plentiful in 
rural communities.’’ 
‘‘Age discrimination is alive and well 
in the job market.’’ 
‘‘No one hires old people.’’ 
‘‘I am 63 with no job . . . still trying 
to find work.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article entitled: ‘‘I’m not dead: In-
side the struggle of finding work after 
50 in North Texas.’’ 
[From the Dallas Business Journal, Feb. 11, 
2019] 
‘I’M NOT DEAD’: INSIDE THE STRUGGLE OF 
FINDING WORK AFTER 50 IN NORTH TEXAS 
(By Jason Wheeler) 
The good news first: Diana Hinton’s dog 
Maxwell has been on a lot of walks lately. 
The bad news: She’s had time for that. 
Hinton’s employer of almost three decades 
downsized, and she had to take early retire-
ment long before she was ready. 
A recent data analysis by Pro Publica and 
the Urban Institute found that early retire-
ments are often not as voluntary as they 
sound. 
The 
analysis 
also 
found 
that 
shockingly high percentages of workers over 
50 are forced out of their jobs before they can 
reach retirement age. 
On one of those frequent walks with Max-
well, Diana Hinton told us she and her dog 
thought their outings would be for a limited 
time only. 
‘‘I think the first few weeks he was looking 
at me like aren’t you going somewhere?’’ 
Hinton said. 
Those few weeks became a few years. 
When we talked to her in September 2018, 
Diana was busy going about her usual rou-
tine of filling out applications online and 
sending out resumes. Often, she found herself 
paining over that dreaded question on the 
application form. 
‘‘Here we go . . . ‘when did you graduate 
high school?’ Which I hate because I know 
they start adding in their heads—she’s gotta 
be in her 50s,’’ Hinton said. 
She was 53 at the time. When we talked to 
her, we had just begun a series of reports on 
the middle class called ‘‘Stuck in the Mid-
dle.’’ 
On social media, we heard from so many 
people in the 50-plus age group talking about 
the difficulty of finding employment. A sam-
pling of the messages: 
‘‘. . . No jobs for older people.’’ 
‘‘Jobs for seniors 60+ who still want to 
work are not so plentiful in the rural com-
munities.’’ 
‘‘Age discrimination is alive and well in 
the job market.’’ 
‘‘No one hires old people.’’ 
‘‘I am 63 with no job . . . still trying to 
find work . . .’’ 
Many respondents also bolstered another 
of the findings made by Pro Publica and the 
Urban Institute—that being derailed so close 
to retirement age is devastating to retire-
ment plans. A sampling of the messages 
about how long people will have to work: 
‘‘I’m still working at 78.’’ 
‘‘. . . gonna die working.’’ 
‘‘Looks like I’m working full time until 
dead, and leaving nothing behind.’’ 
‘‘Foreverrrrrrrrrrrrr . . .’’ 
‘‘Till the end.’’ 
‘‘We don’t even talk about retirement age 
anymore,’’ said Claire Turner, deputy direc-
tor of the Elder Financial Safety Center at 
The Senior Source. ‘‘People are wanting to 
work as long as they can. So they get the 
question in the interview where do you see 
yourself in five years? I see myself working.’’ 
The Senior Source specifically helps people 
50 and over to search for jobs. They offer free 
resume workshops, conduct mock job inter-
views, and teach software and social media 
classes, among other things. 
Each year, the center helps as many as 
2,000 older workers, and Turner said, un-
equivocally, ‘‘There is age discrimination. It 
is true. The average duration of unemploy-
ment nationwide is 22.7 weeks, but for older 
adults, it is 32 weeks.’’ 
‘‘I think seniors bring a lot to the table,’’ 
said 64-year-old Michael Dade, who took 
classes at The Senior Source after he had to 
take early retirement from an accounting 
job at an oil company that downsized. ‘‘I felt 
like I had to be twice as good as some young 
person.’’ 
Dade cautioned others in his age group 
who still have jobs to stay hungry. 
‘‘I have seen people who basically put it in 
cruise control at (age) 55,’’ Dade said. ‘‘No 
one has paid enough dues to have a guaran-
teed job now. Any day you go to work you 
have to think it could be your last day and 
plan that way.’’ 
Dade now drives the van and coordinates 
volunteers at The Senior Source. He advised 
younger people to pay attention to the 
plight of older workers who lose, or are 
forced out of, their jobs. He warned those 
younger workers that they, too, will be older 
workers someday. He also said the older 
worker being forced out of a job could be 
their parents. 
Dade suggested that younger people reduce 
their debt load, save as much as they can, 
maximize contributions to their retirement 
plans, and learn as many marketable skills 
as possible. That’s something he took advan-
tage of in his former job. 
‘‘I tried to make myself learn as much as 
I could,’’ Dade said. 
Hinton also told us she took every training 
her former company offered, and she advises 
others to do the same, because it beats pay-
ing for those classes on your own someday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6161 
November 3, 2021 
Pro Tip: Claire Turner said it’s not enough 
to simply acquire knowledge and skills—you 
have to be able to communicate those assets 
to potential employers, while still sounding 
humble. For instance, if you have always 
been a dependable worker, you would say 
something like, ‘‘Past employers say my at-
tendance is perfect . . . you want to say peo-
ple ‘say’ I am good at this. That’s always a 
great way to deliver that message,’’ Turner 
said. 
A bright spot: Turner said she is seeing 
evidence that the tight job market created 
by a low unemployment rate is helping older 
workers who are unemployed. 
‘‘Employers are very open to older workers 
that they may not have been before,’’ Turner 
said. 
We checked back with Hinton four months 
after our first visit. She has seen no sign of 
that new openness to older workers. Hinton’s 
situation had become more desperate. 
A few temporary gigs had come and gone, 
but she had yet to land a permanent job, de-
spite decades of customer service experience, 
much of it in management. 
The lack of employment was impacting 
most aspects of her life: 
Housing: ‘‘Of course, the house, we don’t 
want to lose it. It may get to that point—not 
maybe soon—but maybe in the next six 
(months) to a year.’’ 
Health: ‘‘I have medication I can’t afford 
so I don’t take it.’’ 
Retirement funds (which have depleted 
some): ‘‘I don’t even want to check my Fidel-
ity account.’’ 
We asked her how many jobs she has ap-
plied for since she lost permanent employ-
ment two years ago. 
‘‘Oh my God!’’ she said. ‘‘I would say . . . 
over 250. I got out of that . . . maybe 10 
interviews.’’ 
That lines up with a 2017 study done by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in 
which researchers sent out tens of thousands 
of fictitious applications from different aged 
artificial applicants who had similar back-
grounds. They found that younger workers 
were significantly more likely to get a call 
back from prospective employers than older 
workers were. 
‘‘I’m articulate,’’ she said. ‘‘I have an en-
ergy. I’m not dead. Whatever the curse is 
. . . whatever it is it needs to go away.’’ 
Worried that her expansive resume might 
make her look overqualified (and over age), 
she shortened it from four pages to two. 
Pro Tip: Claire Turner at The Senior 
Source said, ‘‘When I was looking, I had 25 
resumes. Every single word was true, but I 
had three different careers. We see all the 
time people walk in with a resume that is 
very impressive, with all these years of expe-
rience. They present that for a customer 
service position and there is no correlation. 
The employer doesn’t even understand why 
you applied. So it is a matter of tailoring 
your resume. It is definitely honest and fac-
tual; it is just showing things that are rel-
evant. The industry standard is that people 
only show the last ten years.’’ 
As we wrapped up our second visit with 
Hinton, she was still filling out applications. 
But she had also just received another rejec-
tion email. 
‘‘It says, ‘Dear Diana, thanks for your in-
terest in our customer service position. Un-
fortunately you have not been selected to 
continue in our process for this position.’ ’’ 
Her dog, Maxwell, rests at her feet. 
‘‘Maybe he is my calm,’’ Hinton said. ‘‘He’s 
calming me.’’ 
Hinton wonders if she will ever leave him 
again to go back to work. 
‘‘I am pretty strong, but I am almost slid-
ing down, and I have to keep telling myself, 
‘Come on, Diana, you can do this.’ I didn’t 
think it was going to be this hard.’’ 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill will help people trying to re-
cover from this pandemic, including 
people who lost their job in the middle 
of their career who now fear they will 
never work again because of discrimi-
natory hiring practices. 
This is not about trial lawyers. It is 
not anything about what some of my 
colleagues across the aisle have talked 
about. It is just a simple clarification 
bill. It clarifies that job protections for 
older Americans begin at the time of 
the application. 
I want to thank the AARP, the Na-
tional Council on Aging, the Leader-
ship Council of Aging Organizations, 
the American Federation of Govern-
ment Employees, and the White House 
for supporting efforts and this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the letters of en-
dorsement for this bill from the AARP 
and the National Council on Aging that 
I just mentioned. 
AARP, 
September 27, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY. 
Republican Leader, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of our nearly 38 million mem-
bers and all older Americans nationwide, 
AARP writes in support of H.R. 3992, the Pro-
tect Older Job Applicants Act (POJA), im-
portant legislation sponsored by Rep. Sylvia 
Garcia (D–TX) to protect older job applicants 
against age discrimination. 
Older workers are valuable assets to their 
employers and the economy, and additional 
protections are needed as the country recov-
ers from COVID–19. Despite their value, 78 
percent of older workers reported having 
seen or experienced age discrimination in 
the workplace in 2020, up markedly from 61 
percent in 2018. The pandemic has signifi-
cantly diminished the job prospects and fu-
ture retirement security of older workers. 
Americans age 55 and up experience long- 
term unemployment at a higher rate com-
pared to younger job seekers and age dis-
crimination makes it harder for them to re-
turn to the workforce. 
We are pleased that this bill extends Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) 
protections to job applicants so everyone 
will have an equal opportunity when apply-
ing for a job. H.R. 3992 complements the Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Discrimina-
tion Act (H.R. 2062), a bipartisan, common-
sense bill that the House of Representatives 
passed on June 23. POJA goes a step further 
to ensure the legal rights of applicants for 
jobs are protected as well. 
AARP strongly supports POJA and urges 
you to enact it as soon as possible: 
Sincerely, 
BILL SWEENEY, 
Senior Vice President, 
Government Affairs. 
NCOA, 
NATIONAL COUNCIL ON AGING, 
July 23, 2021. 
Hon. SYLVIA R. GARCIA, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN GARCIA: On behalf of 
the National Council on Aging, I am pleased 
to endorse your legislation to strengthen 
protections for older workers under the Pro-
tect Older Job Applicants Act of 2021 (H.R. 
3992). 
Ageism is one of the last socially accept-
able forms of discrimination in our society— 
and it remains stubbornly ingrained in too 
many workplaces. AARP research shows that 
in 2020, nearly 80 percent of older workers re-
ported having seen or experienced age dis-
crimination at work. 
As age discrimination has increased during 
the pandemic, so have job losses among older 
workers. Nearly 2 million workers aged 55 
and older were unemployed in June, and 55.3 
percent 
were 
long-term 
unemployed 
(27 
weeks or longer), a rate that exceeds that of 
their younger counterparts. Research from 
The New School Schwartz Center for Eco-
nomic Policy Analysis reveals that another 
1.7 million older adults abandoned the job 
search and retired earlier than anticipated, 
setting many of them up for financial insecu-
rity in their later years. 
As Congress takes steps to promote eco-
nomic recovery and job creation and place-
ment, Age Discrimination in Employment 
(ADEA) protections must be restored and 
strengthened. In 2019, the 7th U.S. Circuit 
Court 
of 
Public 
Appeals 
(Kleber 
v. 
CareFusion Corp., No. 17–1206) ruled that 
ADEA protections apply only to current em-
ployees and do not extend to external appli-
cants. The Protect Older Job Applicants Act 
will restore the original ADEA intent and 
clarify and codify these crucial protections 
for older workers seeking new employment. 
It’s time to treat age discrimination the 
same as every other unlawful bias in the 
workplace. We applaud your leadership on 
behalf of older workers and urge Congress to 
pass your legislation quickly to ensure they 
have equal access to employment opportuni-
ties as the economy recovers and into the fu-
ture. 
Sincerely, 
RAMSEY ALWIN, 
President and CEO. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
together we can and will protect older 
workers during the hiring phase of em-
ployment with this bill. Everyone de-
serves a shot at the American Dream, 
regardless of their age. This is common 
sense. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bipartisan bill, pro-
tecting our older workers. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, we heard 
about the justification for this legisla-
tion, and we are discussing older job 
applicants. Just some context that I 
would like to add about how well older 
job applicants and workers have been 
faring in recent decades. 
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, for workers age 65 and older, 
employment tripled from 1988 to 2018, 
while 
employment 
among 
younger 
workers only grew by about one-third. 
Among people age 75 and older, the 
number of employed people nearly 
quadrupled, increasing from 461,000 in 
1998 to 1.8 million in 2018.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6162 
November 3, 2021 
The labor force participation rate for 
older workers has been steadily in-
creasing since the late 1990s, while par-
ticipation rates for younger age groups 
either declined or flattened during the 
same period. 
Over the past 20 years, the number of 
older workers on full-time work sched-
ules grew 21⁄2 times faster than the 
number working part time. 
Full-time employees are now a ma-
jority of older workers. They were 61 
percent in 2018, up from 46 percent in 
1998. 
These statistics paint a picture of 
rising full-time employment among 
older workers, and they do not portray 
rampant discrimination against older 
job applicants. 
As the economy recovers from the 
pandemic, older workers will continue 
to prosper. 
H.R. 3992 is yet another Democrat 
bill in search of a problem. It will re-
sult in an avalanche of class action 
litigation against employers for using 
standard, reasonable recruiting meth-
ods, and I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
bill. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to note that the 
reality is that there is substantial evi-
dence that older workers are routinely 
harmed by plausibly neutral but age- 
discriminate hiring practices. 
For example, in 2017, the Federal Re-
serve Bank of San Francisco conducted 
a study on age discrimination and hir-
ing by sending similar resumes to 
13,000 job openings in 12 cities, totaling 
40,000 applicants. For all five job posi-
tion types they studied, the callback 
rate was higher for younger applicants 
and lower for older applicants, con-
sistent with age discrimination in hir-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
b 1700 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Speaker and I thank the 
manager very much, and I thank Con-
gresswoman GARCIA of Texas for her 
leadership and sponsorship of H.R. 3992, 
Protect Older Job Applicants Act. It is 
long overdue and an important initia-
tive. 
Words from Patti Temple Rocks, 
communications 
professional, 
really 
capture what this bill is about: ‘‘I was 
still on my game, but I was being 
moved . . . to make room for someone 
younger.’’ 
Let me be very clear. There is a great 
opportunity for all of us to be em-
ployed, and that is what this legisla-
tion says. It is specifically making sure 
that every American worker is pro-
tected. Specifically, this bill will make 
it unlawful to limit, segregate, or clas-
sify job applicants in any way which 
would deprive or tend to deprive any 
individual of employment opportuni-
ties or otherwise adversely affect his or 
her status as a job applicant because of 
such individual’s age. 
This bill will include the job applica-
tion process in ADEA’s antidiscrimina-
tion provisions and, again, disallow 
anyone from classifying you and dis-
criminating because of age. 
H.R. 3992 would give external can-
didates the express right under Federal 
law to bring these types of claims 
against employers. What I would sim-
ply say to my friends, this is to pro-
hibit but it is also to prevent or inter-
vene so that employers can know the 
right things to do. 
According to AARP, one in four 
workers age 45 and older have been sub-
jected to negative comments about 
their age from supervisors or cowork-
ers, and 76 percent age discrimination 
find that as a hurdle in helping to find 
a new job. 
We also recognize that there is a lot 
of talent with older workers. Paradox-
ically, what most companies do not 
seem to understand is that older work-
ers possess a depth of knowledge and 
experience that is worth paying for and 
is not easily replaced and can be tapped 
in from many different ways; and, as 
well, having a mix of people of all gen-
erations, able and ready, and disabled, 
if you will, to work alongside of each 
other. 
‘‘People walk out of companies now 
with an enormous amount of intellec-
tual property in their heads,’’ says 
Paul Rupert, the founder and CEO of 
Respectful Exits, a nonprofit con-
sulting firm that is raising corporate 
awareness about age discrimination. 
‘‘They know things that are essential 
to the company’s success, and if that 
knowledge is not captured and trans-
mitted to the next generation, that 
company is losing a tremendous chunk 
of capital, and it will eventually pay a 
price.’’ 
So what is the point? The point is to 
recognize how important it is to ensure 
that we don’t discriminate. In fact, 
women age 40 are finding that if they 
lose a job they, too, are being discrimi-
nated against in terms of getting a job. 
I want to, again, salute the sponsor 
of this legislation, the manager of this 
legislation, and of course, the chair-
man of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, Chairman SCOTT, along with all 
of those who supported this to ensure 
this is about fairness. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, we always promote equal jus-
tice. We partner with the Education 
and Labor Committee in its work on 
equal justice. So this is legislation that 
provides opportunities for equal jus-
tice, and I would ask my colleagues to 
support this bill, H.R. 3992, Protect 
Older Job Applicants Act. But more 
importantly, let’s protect the intellec-
tual capital of all Americans, every job 
applicant. 
Let 
there 
not 
be 
discrimination 
against you for race or color or creed 
or disability or gender or anything 
else, and certainly have respect for 
that intellectual capital that older 
American workers bring to the work-
force. Let’s celebrate it; let’s have a 
good time with it; and let’s build our 
companies on all of this genius that 
happens to be the American workers 
now today. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
3992, the ‘‘Protect Older Job Applicants Act,’’ 
which will amend the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits age- 
based discrimination in hiring, to specifically 
prohibit employers from limiting, segregating, 
or classifying job applicants on the basis of 
age. 
People of all ages, but especially older ap-
plicants, must be protected from discriminatory 
practices and loopholes that hurt their chances 
to get a job, especially as we have seen that 
older American workers have disproportion-
ately experienced long-term unemployment in 
the COVID economy. 
The federal Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act (ADEA) of 1967 was passed to pro-
hibit age-based discrimination for current em-
ployees and job applicants. 
However, two federal circuit court decisions 
over the last five years have ruled that some 
provisions of the ADEA’s federal anti-age dis-
crimination protections only applied to current 
employees, not job applicants. 
In 2016, the 11th Circuit case Villarreal v. 
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company held that the 
ADEA disparate impact statute only covers 
employees, but not older applicants, and in 
2019, the 7th Circuit adopted the same inter-
pretation in Kleber v. CareFusion Corporation. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to re-
view the appellate court decisions. 
Currently, employers, especially those within 
the 7th and 11th Circuits, have a valid defense 
to claims under the ADEA where external job 
applicants allege they have been negatively 
impacted by hiring practices on the basis of 
their age. 
H.R. 3992 would give external candidates 
the express right under federal law to bring 
these types of claims against employers. 
This bill will include the job application proc-
ess in ADEA’s antidiscrimination provisions. 
Specifically, this bill will make it unlawful ‘‘to 
limit, segregate, or classify . . . [job appli-
cants] in any way which would deprive or tend 
to deprive any individual of employment op-
portunities or otherwise adversely affect his 
status as . . . [a job applicant], because of 
such individual’s age.’’ 
According to the AARP, 1 in 4 workers age 
45 and older have been subjected to negative 
comments about their age from supervisors or 
coworkers, and 76 percent see age discrimi-
nation as a hurdle to finding a new job. 
In one University of California, Irvine, study, 
re´sume´s were sent out on behalf of more than 
40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages for 
thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, admin-
istrative assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 
cities. 
This study found that the older the applicant 
was, the fewer callbacks the applicant re-
ceived. 
This study also found that age discrimina-
tion has the highest impact on women, who 
suffer more age discrimination then men start-
ing in their 40s. 
According to David Neumark, a professor of 
economics who oversaw the study, ‘‘[t]he evi-
dence of age discrimination against women 
. . . pops out in every study’’ conducted on 
age discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6163 
November 3, 2021 
Ageism is still very much present in our so-
ciety, and it is important we acknowledge that 
we still have much work to do to correct this 
bias and give every job applicant a fair and 
equal opportunity when applying for a job. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers on the underlying 
bill, and I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been a recruiter 
for a for-profit corporation. I did that 
for 15 years where I had the responsi-
bility of recruiting on college cam-
puses and hiring and making those de-
cisions for a company for which I was 
depended on to find the absolute best 
workers, and that was not during a 
time when we had 10 million open jobs 
in the country and companies so des-
perate to find quality workers and fill 
those positions. I did this for a com-
pany that was vulnerable to the very 
consequences that we want to bring in 
greater capacity here today on this 
House floor. 
Once again, we have got House Demo-
crats trying to solve a nonexistent cri-
sis instead of the many that they have 
created; 
massive 
spending, 
rising 
crime, gas prices going through the 
roof, increased inflation for groceries 
and 
other 
things, 
surging 
illegals 
across the border, firing cops and 
nurses and first responders because 
they don’t get a vaccine that we are 
forcing upon them. 
Instead of dealing with those, this 
majority is here focused instead on yet 
another manufactured problem with 
yet another leftist solution that has 
the added benefit from their perspec-
tive of paying off their trial lawyer do-
nors. 
They miss the point about disparate 
impact. As an example, a job recruiter 
goes to a college campus, spends sev-
eral days recruiting, happens to only 
have 
typical 
younger, 
college-age 
workers apply, hires some of those 
workers, and now their trial lawyer 
friends would sue them because they 
didn’t hire any older workers when no 
older workers applied because they 
used a typical standard practice for 
hiring entry-level workers. That is a 
real example. 
They don’t understand the difference 
between impact and treatment. We al-
ready have laws prohibiting the prac-
tice of disparate treatment on age dis-
crimination basis. 
This misnamed piece of legislation 
does nothing to truly protect older job 
applicants. Again, older job applicants 
are already protected by the law, and 
age discrimination is already illegal. 
Democrats just want to raise the 
stakes for their lawyer friends, making 
it easier to sue and the penalties more 
severe perhaps so that they can then 
donate more to Democrat campaigns. 
Democrats don’t want to acknowl-
edge that sound economic policy, if 
they could recognize it, is what is good 
for older Americans; low taxes, less 
regulation. That benefits older Amer-
ican job applicants just like everybody 
else, not more regulation, penalization 
of employees, and unnecessary victim-
ization. 
It has already been said, according to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these 
are the facts. Don’t let the facts get in-
volved with bad legislation. I know, 
don’t interfere. But the facts show, and 
I would like my colleagues across the 
aisle to explain the problem with the 
facts, that the number of workers age 
75 and older in the workforce has quad-
rupled in the last 30 years, rising from 
461,000 in 1988 to 1.8 million in 2018. 
But, again, this legislation is about 
trial lawyers, not older Americans, and 
this bill would serve as yet another 
burden on small business owners. 
In the age of online job postings and 
digital 
recruiting, 
this 
legislation 
would make employers vulnerable for 
any form of recruiting that brings in 
younger applicants. Online job boards, 
social media, even the simple act of 
posting a position online could be chal-
lenged under this bill simply because 
younger 
applicants 
tend 
to 
apply 
through those processes and search for 
jobs through those mechanisms. 
The unintended—or, I suspect, the 
truly intended—consequence of this 
bill would be countless class action 
lawsuits against employers who are al-
ready struggling under Democrat ef-
forts to cripple our economy. 
Democrats have spent 2 years closing 
businesses with lockdowns, firing em-
ployees with their vaccine mandates, 
and paying more people to stay home. 
Here’s another way: Let them benefit 
from a trial lawyer who sues on their 
behalf under this bill. Heck, even Mem-
bers of this very body are staying home 
rather than attending committee hear-
ings or voting in this Chamber. And 
now that America is trying to reopen 
in spite of them, Democrats want to 
have their trial lawyer friends sue 
more business employers and job cre-
ators. 
What we do on this floor has con-
sequences that reach into every corner 
of this great Nation; a sad and dan-
gerous reality under this majority this 
year. But Democrats are relentless in 
their determination to pass legislation 
with a compassionate title—it sounds 
good—for a manufactured crisis and a 
policy that hurts small businesses and 
kills jobs. It is what they do. 
As I said before, the Democrat major-
ity has unveiled contempt for employ-
ers, businesses, and job creators, and 
they continue to perpetuate this ‘‘us 
against them’’ mind set between em-
ployees and employers or employers 
and job applicants. They truly believe 
that employers are hostile to and 
exploitive of their employees, and they 
need more regulation, again, when we 
have 10 million job openings and em-
ployers desperate to fill those positions 
so they can stay open. 
The socialist America that the left 
clearly wants is not the America that 
our constituents and millions of Amer-
icans know and love; as the results in 
Virginia 
and 
New 
Jersey 
clearly 
showed last night, bipartisan results, 
because there are not that many Re-
publicans in Virginia or New Jersey to 
deliver those results. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. I do want to note with regard 
to my colleague’s remarks, I believe 
there is a House rule about not im-
pugning the motives of people who are 
here on this distinguished floor of the 
House of Representatives. 
Older workers are suffering from a 
higher rate of long-term unemploy-
ment versus their younger peers. Ac-
cording to AARP, this has produced 
devastating consequences during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as 74 percent of 
workers aged 40 to 65 who have lost a 
job in 2020 reported being unemployed 
for more than 6 months. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, this is already 
the law of the land except for people in 
two Federal circuits here in the United 
States. This bill is intended to make a 
uniform law across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Discrimination is wrong, and it has 
been illegal in the United States for 
decades, as it should be. 
Older workers are faring well in the 
workforce without the help from us in 
Congress, and they don’t need a trial 
lawyer payoff—disguised as a win for 
older workers—that will threaten rou-
tine hiring practices, limit job oppor-
tunities, and create a tsunami of para-
sitic litigation. 
We should ensure that our legislation 
does not have unintended consequences 
that are negative and harmful, but 
H.R. 3992 fails miserably in this regard 
when it comes to protecting older 
workers and ensuring job opportunities 
for current and future workers. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3992, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Passing the bipartisan Protect Older 
Job Applicants Act should be a priority 
of every Member of Congress. Repub-
licans and Democrats worked together 
just a few months ago to advance the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. This bipartisan effort 
was a major step toward ensuring older 
workers can assert legal claims to hold 
employers accountable for disparate 
treatment that results in age discrimi-
nation. 
However, we cannot defeat age dis-
crimination in employment if we leave 
older job applicants behind. Without 
equal protections, older workers are 
still being denied job opportunities be-
cause of hiring practices that, while 
not intentionally discriminatory, ulti-
mately exclude workers based on their 
age.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6164 
November 3, 2021 
Providing job applicants with the 
tools to seek justice for discriminatory 
hiring practices is not just the right 
thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. 
In 2018 our economy missed out on as 
much as $850 billion in gross domestic 
product because older workers who 
wished to switch jobs, grow in their 
jobs, or reenter the workforce were de-
nied that opportunity. 
The Protect Older Job Applicants 
Act addresses this gap in an important 
ADEA protection and helps older work-
ers eliminate barriers that prevent 
them from fully contributing to our 
economy. 
More broadly, this legislation will 
deliver on the promise of the ADEA 
and help ensure that all older workers, 
regardless of whether they are looking 
for a job or already have one, are 
equally protected against age discrimi-
nation under the law in every part of 
the country. 
I want to again thank Ms. GARCIA for 
her leadership. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, thank 
you today, the House has an opportunity to 
support older workers by passing H.R. 3992, 
the Protect Older Job Applicants Act, intro-
duced by Representative GARCIA of Texas. 
While Americans are working later in life 
than ever before, many older workers are find-
ing that their experience can count against 
them when applying for new jobs. Research 
shows that three-fourths of workers age 45 
and older say age discrimination has eroded 
their confidence in finding a new job, and 
more than 40 percent of older job applicants 
have been asked for age-related information in 
the hiring process. 
For more than half a century, older workers 
and older job applicants who face age dis-
crimination were equally protected under the 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or A– 
D–E–A. 
Earlier this year, House Republicans and 
Democrats came together to pass the Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act, which strengthens protections for workers 
who allege disparate treatment based on age 
under the A–D–E–A. 
Unfortunately, recent decisions in the Sev-
enth and Eleventh Federal Circuit Courts have 
excluded job applicants from seeking recourse 
under the disparate impact provision of the A– 
D–E–A, even while maintaining that same pro-
tection for current employees. 
This means older job applicants in the Sev-
enth and Eleventh Circuits can only challenge 
age discrimination in hiring when they prove 
that an employer intended to discriminate 
based on age. They are unable to challenge 
hiring practices that appear neutral, but, in 
fact, result in a disproportionate, harmful im-
pact on older workers. 
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court declined 
to grant review of this matter. Therefore, it is 
up to Congress to clarify what has otherwise 
been the law of the land with regard to the 
coverage of job applicants under the A–D–E– 
A. 
Current law provides recourse for job appli-
cants in most jurisdictions, but not all. By 
amending the A–D–E–A, this legislation clari-
fies that older job applicants across the coun-
try can effectively seek justice when they are 
harmed by age discrimination in hiring. 
The Administration issued a Statement of 
Administration Policy in support of this legisla-
tion. It states in part: 
‘‘Workplace age discrimination, including at 
the application stage, prevents people from 
fully accessing the American dream and limits 
the contributions that they can make to our 
shared prosperity. Ensuring equitable access 
to employment is a priority for the Administra-
tion. The Administration supports this legisla-
tion that protects older job applicants.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. PAPPAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part E of House Report 117– 
137. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 1, after line 12, insert the following: 
SEC. 3. STUDY. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission shall conduct 
a study to determine the number of claims 
pending or filed with the Commission since 
2015 under the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.), 
including claims in closed cases, by job ap-
plicants who may have been adversely im-
pacted by age discrimination in the job ap-
plication process. The Chairman of the Com-
mission shall submit to the Committee on 
Education and Labor of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Sen-
ate, and shall make available to the public, 
a report that contains the results of the 
study, including recommendations for best 
practices to prevent, combat, and address 
age discrimination in the hiring process. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Mr. 
PAPPAS) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Hampshire. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to require 
the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission to conduct a study on the 
number of job applicants impacted by 
age 
discrimination 
and 
issue 
rec-
ommendations on addressing age dis-
crimination in the job application 
process. 
Nearly half of older job applicants re-
port being asked for age-related infor-
mation when applying for a job, and 
three-quarters of workers over the age 
of 45 lack confidence in their ability to 
find a new job due to age discrimina-
tion. 
This poses a significant challenge for 
workers in my home State of New 
Hampshire. As a State with an aging 
workforce, New Hampshire businesses 
are concerned about both how to at-
tract talent and how to ensure that the 
institutional knowledge and experience 
of workers reaching retirement age is 
passed down. When workers are pushed 
out of our labor force by age discrimi-
nation or by the concern that they may 
face discrimination, our businesses and 
communities lose the benefit of their 
knowledge and experience. 
Strengthening 
age 
discrimination 
laws is the right thing to do because it 
will both protect workers and also 
serve to help keep them in our labor 
force at a time when businesses are al-
ready struggling to attract talent. In 
our changing economy, we need to en-
sure that older workers continue to 
have opportunities available to them. 
We must pass the Protect Older Job 
Applicants Act to clarify that job ap-
plicants can challenge discriminatory 
hiring practices under the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense amendment and help us 
gain a better understanding of the 
issues that older job applicants face 
when applying for jobs and the solu-
tions that are needed to stop discrimi-
natory practices. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
two letters in support of the under-
lying legislation, one from the Amer-
ican Federation of Government Em-
ployees and one from the Leadership 
Council of Aging Organizations. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF 
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, September 28, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
American Federation of Government Em-
ployees, AFL–CIO (AFGE), which represents 
more than 700,000 federal and District of Co-
lumbia employees, I urge you to vote for 
H.R. 3992, the ‘‘Protect Older Job Applicants 
(POJA) Act of 2021.’’ 
Under existing law, the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act (ADEA) only ap-
plies to currently employed people seeking 
recourse in the face of employment discrimi-
nation based on age. The ADEA does not 
cover job applicants who experience age dis-
crimination in hiring, including applicants 
for federal government positions. 
H.R. 3992 extends the protections of the 
ADEA to external job applicants in addition 
to employees. Specifically, this legislation 
would allow job applicants to be able to 
bring 
disparate 
impact 
discrimination 
claims under the ADEA. The bill would pro-
tect older Americans against employment 
discrimination that prevent them from even 
getting a foot in the door. Considering the 
heightened long-term unemployment strug-
gles older Americans have experienced dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, this bill is criti-
cally important. 
Building on our support for H.R. 1230, the 
‘‘Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act,’’ AFGE is proud to be a

leader in the fight against all forms of em-
ployment discrimination including those af-
fecting older Americans. Please support H.R. 
3992, the ‘‘Protect Older Job Applicants 
(POJA) Act of 2021.’’ 
Sincerely, 
JULIE N. TIPPENS, 
Director, Legislative Department. 
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL 
OF AGING ORGANIZATIONS, 
Washington, DC, September 28, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: The Leader-
ship Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO) 
is a coalition of 69 national nonprofit organi-
zations concerned with the well-being of 
America’s older population and committed 
to representing their interests in the policy- 
making arena. We urge you to strengthen 
protections for older workers by voting for 
H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job Applicants 
Act (POJA) of 2021. POJA would clarify that 
the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act’s (ADEA) prohibition against all forms 
of employment discrimination based on age 
covers individuals during the hiring phase of 
employment. 
Age discrimination is pervasive and stub-
bornly entrenched. It often starts in the hir-
ing process when employers circumvent anti- 
age discrimination laws by using such tac-
tics as setting a maximum number of years 
of experience that a prospective employer 
will consider or setting up screening proc-
esses that exclude older applicants. In 2020, 
78 percent of older workers reported having 
seen or experienced age discrimination in 
the workplace—a significant increase from 
61 percent in 2018. Age discrimination is also 
pervasive among older women and African 
American workers—nearly two thirds of 
women and three-fourths of African Ameri-
cans say they have seen or experienced work-
place discrimination. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has wreaked havoc on employment for 
everyone, with older workers taking a harder 
hit. Those aged 55+ continue to experience 
long-term unemployment in greater num-
bers, with 55.3 percent of older jobseekers un-
employed for 27 weeks or more as of June 
2021, compared to 36 percent of younger 
workers. The rates were worse for older 
workers who were black, female, or who did 
not have a college degree. 
Although the ADEA was meant to apply to 
all forms of age discrimination in hiring, re-
cent court decisions have narrowly inter-
preted the applicability of ADEA’s protec-
tions and have excluded job applicants who 
are subjected to hiring practices that have a 
discriminatory impact based on age, such as 
specifying a maximum number of years of 
experience. The Protect Older Job Appli-
cants Act would clarify that older workers 
seeking employment should be protected 
from all forms of age discrimination in hir-
ing. 
We urge Congress to swiftly pass the Pro-
tect Older Job Applicants Act and clarify the 
ADEA’s prohibition against hiring practices 
that have a discriminatory impact on older 
workers. 
Sincerely, 
KATIE SMITH SLOAN, 
Chair. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately this amendment is a day 
late and a dollar short. It requires the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission to study the extent of dis-
crimination 
against 
job 
applicants 
based on age and make recommenda-
tions of best practices to prevent dis-
crimination. This study could possibly 
yield useful information, but it is in-
formation we should have obtained be-
fore we vote on H.R. 3992. 
Further, the amendment tacitly ac-
knowledges that we need more infor-
mation before we vote on this bill. This 
is classic ready, fire, aim. 
The Committee on Education and 
Labor rushed to mark up H.R. 3992 only 
a month after it was introduced with-
out holding a single hearing on the bill, 
a measure which is sorely lacking the 
examination that it deserves. 
However, the information we do have 
more than suggests that this bill is un-
necessary. The Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act already prohibits dis-
crimination against job applicants be-
cause of age. Moreover, older workers 
have done well in the job market in re-
cent decades. Again, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for workers 
age 65 and older, employment tripled 
from 1988 to 2018, while employment 
among younger workers only grew by 
about a third. 
This amendment, which requires a 
study after the underlying bill has al-
ready been signed into law, does noth-
ing to address the problems in the bill. 
H.R. 3992 will threaten routine re-
cruitment and hiring practices, such as 
participating in college job fairs and 
posting to online job boards, at a time 
when nearly 8 million Americans are 
unemployed and employers are strug-
gling to find workers to fill the more 
than 10 million available jobs. 
I oppose this amendment, which is a 
day late and a dollar short, and I 
strongly oppose the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I will cor-
rect the record again on the fact that 
the committee did hold a hearing on 
this subject on March 18, 2021. 
At that hearing, Laurie McCann, a 
senior attorney at AARP Foundation, 
testified about the erosion of protec-
tions for older workers in judicial deci-
sions under the ADEA, including spe-
cific mention in her testimony of the 
Seventh Circuit’s Kleber decision and 
its harmful impact on applicants. So, 
that is well-documented. 
This particular amendment seeks to 
give us additional information going 
forward that would be valuable in un-
derstanding the plight of older job ap-
plicants. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today, Mr. Speaker, on behalf 
of the millions of older workers who 
desperately need our help. 
Last year, we saw older Americans 
leave the workforce more than we ever 
have before, in fact, more than in the 
last seven decades. 
We are seeing tens of thousands of 
workers with the right qualifications 
for a job being turned away all because 
they are 50, maybe even 40, and consid-
ered too old. In fact, 76 percent of older 
American workers reported seeing age 
discrimination when trying to obtain a 
job. 
Mr. Speaker, 76 percent. That is 
clearly unacceptable. 
We need to pass the Protect Older 
Job Applicants Act to ensure Amer-
ica’s older workers are finally pro-
tected from discrimination. But before 
we can solve that problem, we have to 
fully understand it. 
That is why included in this bill is an 
amendment I put forth to ensure the 
Federal Government has the resources 
it needs to study just how many job ap-
plicants 
have 
been 
discriminated 
against based on age. By doing so, we 
can better provide recommendations 
and best practices to further prevent 
this issue because when we lift up all of 
our older workers, we lift up our entire 
economy. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), 
the cosponsor of the underlying legisla-
tion. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Pappas and New-
man 
amendment. 
This 
amendment 
from my colleagues just enhances this 
bill. 
As a former administrative law judge 
for the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in the Houston region, I 
can tell you personally that the type of 
information that would be gathered by 
the EEOC on the number of job appli-
cants impacted by age discrimination 
on the job and all the issues that they 
have 
related 
to 
their 
applications 
would be very helpful. 
It would not only be helpful to the 
administrative law judges at the EEOC; 
it would be helpful for judges that 
would finally hear the cases in court if 
they go to court. It would be helpful 
for research. It would be helpful for ad-
vocacy groups. This information would 
be vital, again, to help us in Congress 
to seek better ways to improve and 
work best on prevention and combating 
and addressing age discrimination in 
the hiring process. 
Mr. Speaker, there is some discussion 
on the other side of the aisle that this 
is a remedy for a problem that doesn’t 
exist. Let me tell you, if you talk to 
advocacy 
groups, 
discrimination 
is 
alive and well. 
We need this legislation. We need 
this amendment. I urge adoption. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. KELLER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part E of House Report 117– 
137. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 1, after line 12, insert the following: 
SEC. 3. DELAYED EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMEND-
MENTS. 
(a) STUDY
REQUIRED.—Subject 
to 
sub-
section (b), the amendments made by this 
Act shall not take effect until the date the 
Government Accountability Office reports to 
Congress the results of a study such Office 
carries out to determine whether not allow-
ing claims of disparate impact discrimina-
tion by applicants for employment under the 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 
1967 (20 U.S.C. 621 et seq.) has a significant 
negative impact on such applicants. 
(b) STUDY RESULTS.—If the results of the 
study carried out under subsection (a) show 
there is not a significant negative impact of 
the kind described in such subsection on ap-
plicants for employment, then the amend-
ments made by this Act shall not take effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, before 
considering any legislation, the House 
should first make a determination 
about whether the proposal is actually 
needed and then should always care-
fully study the pending legislation to 
determine whether it will adequately 
and positively address the issue it pur-
ports to address. Unfortunately, Demo-
crats have failed on both counts with 
H.R. 3992. 
The bill was introduced only 8 legis-
lative days before the Committee on 
Education and Labor markup, and the 
committee did not hold a hearing on 
the legislation. 
As such, we are flying blind as we 
consider H.R. 3992 today. 
H.R. 3992 authorizes disparate impact 
claims for job applicants under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, 
and it has wide-ranging and damaging 
implications that need thorough exam-
ination. 
Significantly, we have had no data on 
whether excluding job applicants from 
disparate impact coverage under the 
ADEA has a significant negative im-
pact on older job applicants. Indeed, to 
date, there have been zero circuit court 
decisions ruling that the ADEA author-
izes job applicants to sue under a dis-
parate impact theory. 
Further, we have no information 
about the numerous effects this sweep-
ing bill would have on job seekers and 
businessowners. As we have heard dur-
ing this debate, H.R. 3992 could need-
lessly interfere with routine recruit-
ment practices, such as college recruit-
ing, apprenticeship programs, and on-
line job postings. 
Given the appalling lack of data on 
the issue and the rush by Democrats to 
pass the bill, this amendment simply 
requires the GAO to conduct a needed 
study on whether excluding job appli-
cants from disparate impact coverage 
under the ADEA has a significant nega-
tive impact on older job applicants. If 
the study finds no such negative im-
pact, the bill would not go into effect. 
This House should not legislate in 
the dark. Unfortunately, this is exactly 
what we are doing here today. 
This amendment will shed some 
much-needed light on a far-reaching 
bill that has not received proper exam-
ination. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin, let me say again for the 
third time that, in fact, the committee 
did have a hearing on this subject. On 
March 18, 2021, the Subcommittees on 
Civil Rights and Human Services and 
Workforce Protections held a hearing 
titled ‘‘Fighting for Fairness: Exam-
ining Legislation to Confront Work-
place Discrimination.’’ 
At that hearing, Laurie McCann, a 
senior attorney at AARP Foundation, 
testified about the erosion of protec-
tions for older workers in judicial deci-
sions under the ADA, including specific 
mention in her testimony of the Sev-
enth Circuit’s Kleber decision and its 
harmful impact on older applicants. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment pre-
vents the legislation from going into 
effect unless the GAO finds that there 
have been negative impacts. This is 
simply a delay tactic with no end date 
in sight. 
The reason we are here today is pre-
cisely because we do have a problem 
due to the circuit court decisions 
which cut off access to the courts for 
job applicants seeking relief under the 
ADEA. 
b 1730 
The Supreme Court has denied cert 
to review this matter. 
We have heard from AARP, one of 
the Nation’s preeminent authorities on 
age discrimination, which has advised 
Congress that these court decisions in 
the 7th and 11th Circuits are not only 
at odds with the intent of the ADEA, 
but that the courthouse doors have 
been unfairly slammed shut to deserv-
ing individuals seeking relief. 
Testimony before the Subcommittee 
on Civil Rights and Human Services 
earlier this year noted that barring 
older applicants from seeking relief for 
disparate impact discrimination is a 
problem, and that without clarifying 
the ADEA, similar plaintiffs will not be 
able to seek justice under the law. 
For example, in the 7th Circuit case, 
Kleber v. CareFusion Corporation, Mr. 
Kleber, a 58-year-old attorney with 
considerable corporate law experience 
applied for an in-house counsel posi-
tion. 
The position required applicants to 
have no more than 7 years of relevant 
legal 
experience, 
which 
effectively 
means that it freezes out job applicants 
that were over age 40. Again, on its 
face it may look neutral, but if you 
say, ‘‘no one with more than 7 years’ 
experience,’’ that cuts out a lot of peo-
ple. 
Despite his significant prior experi-
ence in corporate law, Kleber was de-
nied the opportunity to even interview 
for the job, since the experience limit 
was effectively a proxy for age. 
The 7th Circuit held that because Mr. 
Kleber was an outside job applicant 
rather than an employee seeking a new 
position from within the company, he 
was barred from bringing a disparate 
impact claim. This turns the entire 
purpose of the ADEA on its head, which 
is to remedy age discrimination for 
both jobseekers and employees. Fur-
thermore, we know generalized age dis-
crimination is not isolated. 
In 2017, researchers for the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco sent 
40,000 resumes of applicants of all ages 
to 13,000 job openings across 12 cities. 
They found that older workers received 
substantially fewer callbacks from em-
ployers for job interviews and showed 
particular harm for older women appli-
cants. 
We do not need another study to tell 
us what we already know. Older job ap-
plicants are subjected to age discrimi-
nation when seeking employment and 
that an effective remedy is needed 
when that conduct lacks justification. 
Madam Speaker, finally, this amend-
ment would indefinitely delay imple-
mentation of this bill because there is 
no deadline for GAO to conduct a study 
and report back to Congress. 
Would we even see the results of this 
study and when? Again, this is simply 
a delay tactic. We already have all the 
evidence we need to know that it is 
timely for Congress to act and to pass 
this legislation to protect our older job 
applicants. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-
ment and ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
heard my colleague from Texas say 
that they have had a hearing on the 
subject. Well, our contention is not the 
subject, but the bill. There have been 
zero hearings on this bill, which was 
introduced 8 legislative days ago. 
So I don’t know why there is a rush 
to judgment on whether we should vote 
on this or not without making sure we 
understand all the issues. And since 
the Democrats are unwilling to do 
that, this amendment makes perfect 
sense, if you don’t want to examine it 
and do that beforehand and do the 
proper work up front. Let’s make sure 
before this takes effect and could harm 
older Americans or job creators, we 
should understand the impacts and 
what it means.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6167 
November 3, 2021 
So you can sit here and correct the 
RECORD all you want. What you think 
you are doing when you talk about the 
subject, we are talking about the legis-
lation. And we need to know exactly 
what this legislation is going to do and 
how it is going to impact older Ameri-
cans and our job creators. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 716, the previous question is or-
dered on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration on H.R. 3992 is

BUILD BACK BETTER NOW 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I just wanted to be able to really in-
form the American people and to let 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle know what they are missing out 
on. And that is the greatest effort to 
improve the quality of life of Ameri-
cans and raise their economic level of 
living since Social Security under 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, since the 
Great Society under Lyndon Baines 
Johnson. 
Working moms having the ability to 
not pay more than 7 percent of their 
income to get childcare. Young—just 
beginning school, three years old and 
four years old—and not one three- or 
four-year-old being left out of pre-K. 
Giving them the intellectual stairstep 
to make a difference in their lives. 
And in the State of Texas—the poster 
child for the uninsured—oh, my good-
ness, how we have suffered: 766,000 un-
insured refuse to take the expanded 
Medicaid. And now we have the ability 
to give every person healthcare. And 
when I spoke to a group that was sup-
ported by the American Heart Associa-
tion, they applauded. 
Build back better is what we need to 
do and we need to do it now and pass 
both bills, the Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Bill—changing lives in America. 
f 
NATIONALIZED ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOLS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, one 
of the many concerning provisions in 
the Democrat’s reconciliation bill is 
nationalization 
of 
our 
elementary 
schools. 
The new childcare provisions dras-
tically expand Federal oversight of 
schools, allowing the Biden administra-
tion to determine the education stand-
ards for three- to four-year-olds, and 
places no limit on what additional re-
quirements 
Democrats 
can 
impose 
upon each States’ primary education 
system. 
This bill also delegitimizes family 
and faith-based education, by limiting 
funded preschool options to only facili-
ties which teach curriculum that the 
Biden administration approves of. 
The Secretary of Education recently 
told Congress that parents were not 
‘‘the primary stakeholder’’ in ‘‘deter-
mining 
educational 
programming.’’ 
Really? This means Democrats believe 
government knows better than what 
parents think is right for their chil-
dren. 
Allowing the nationalization of ele-
mentary schools will further politicize 
what our kids are being taught, such as 
divisive ideologies, like critical race 
theory, or exposed to very inappro-
priate instructional materials that I 
can’t speak of here. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot support a 
bill that would hand over more of our 
powers to the government, in an era 
where too many freedoms have already 
been relinquished.

DEMOCRATS NATIONALIZE 
EDUCATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and submit extraneous mate-
rials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
MILLER
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, last month the chair of the 
House Budget Committee, a member of 
Democratic leadership, told me during 
an education committee meeting that 
parents don’t know what is best for 
their children. He said, ‘‘We need to 
protect kids from their parents.’’ 
Last night, in some of the bluest 
parts of our country, parents disagreed. 
Last night was a resounding victory for 
parental rights and the future of our 
country. Parents are fed up—where I 
am from, we say riled up. They bravely 
stood up against the Marxist ideology 
that has taken over the radical left. 
Parents rejected racist critical race 
theory, teaching children that they are 
victims. They rejected a perverted 
sexualized 
curriculum 
forced 
upon 
young children. Parts of this cur-
riculum are so perverted that if you ac-
tually talked about it on the airwaves, 
you would be fined for indecency. Yet, 
this is what is included in some of our 
elementary education curriculum. And 
they rejected a transgender political 
agenda that puts young girls in danger 
in a girls’ restroom and will be the end 
of girls’ athletics. 
In addition, they are being taught to 
hate our country, the land of freedom 
and opportunity. We want our children 
to be smart, to master the core sub-
jects, and to love our neighbors and our 
country. Last night was only the be-
ginning—a revolution of regular peo-
ple. Never estimate the power of reg-
ular people to defend their country and 
their 
children 
and 
their 
freedom. 
American values will always defeat 
Marxist ideology. 
The message from parents is loud and 
clear: Don’t mess with our kids. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman MILLER
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation’s stu-
dents are the future. They are our fu-
ture police officers, doctors, techni-
cians, and manufacturers. And to ac-
complish this, students will need local-
ized education that is sensitive to the 
thoughts and concerns of students, par-
ents, and teachers. That is the system 
we have had in the United States of 
America for many years. 
But lo and behold, inside this multi-
trillion-dollar 
infrastructure 
budget 
reconciliation package that is being 
crafted right now, as we stand here this 
evening, there are plans—and I don’t 
want to blow this out of proportion—to 
nationalize and radicalize our Nation’s 
education system. 
The Washington takeover of edu-
cation would give the Biden adminis-
tration unprecedented levels of Federal 
oversight and the ability to approve 
early education standards and provide 
childcare to wealthy families while 
pushing small providers out of the mar-
ket. 
This proposal comes at a time when 
across the country parents are already 
feeling a little bit cast aside or ex-
cluded from some of the major deci-
sions that are being made in their chil-
dren’s education. 
Students are being taught divisive 
and harmful curriculum. The one that 
is obviously at the forefront is CRT. 
When parents come to their local 
school board meetings to express their 
concerns, they have been met with hos-
tility, and in some cases—extreme 
cases—they arrested a parent. It is 
crazy. 
This is especially important for par-
ents in Wisconsin, my home State. Par-
ents are fed up with the bureaucracy 
telling them they—not the parents— 
know better. And when parents ask

what their children are being taught, 
they often get a very limited and un-
satisfactory response. 
So I came up, along with some of my 
colleagues, with a bill that we thought 
made sense; very easy, common sun-
shine-type 
of 
bill 
that 
ultimately 
would resolve many of these issues. We 
call it the CRT Transparency Act. 
Madam Speaker, the bill requires 
schools to post their curriculums on-
line so that parents can see what their 
students are being taught. Seems sim-
ple to me. Just post it online. You have 
got nothing to hide. It gives the par-
ents the opportunity to see exactly 
what their children are being taught. 
b 1745 
The merits of this bill, I think, would 
ultimately warrant no controversy. 
The bill doesn’t ask school boards to 
make private information public. Ele-
mentary and secondary curriculums 
are already public information. The 
parents who wish to call their school 
districts and inquire can do that. The 
problem is, the onus should not be on 
the parents to jump through hoops to 
get this information. No matter what 
the class may be, the bottom line is 
that the parents have the right to eas-
ily access this information. 
If schools aren’t teaching divisive 
and backward curriculum, then there 
should be absolutely no reason not to 
make this information public. I have 
spoken to local education leaders back 
in southeastern Wisconsin, the Fifth 
Congressional District, who agree with 
the commonsense sentiment behind the 
proposals. Unfortunately, I think that 
President Biden, the Secretary of Edu-
cation, and the Democrats don’t agree, 
necessarily, with the parents having 
that much input. They certainly be-
lieve that they could bring influence to 
that entire educational system, which 
is not something they want. 
That is why the attorney general 
issued a memo instructing the Justice 
Department 
to 
investigate 
parents 
speaking up at the local school boards. 
This is wrong. Despite what my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
may believe, parents do have the right 
to speak up at school board meetings 
and complain and be vocal about what 
their children are being taught. In fact, 
this is the hallmark of being a good 
parent, right? You just don’t want to 
send your kid off to class and not be in-
volved in what they are involved in 
every day. 
What we saw in Virginia last night 
sent an undeniably clear message. 
Those who embrace radical education 
policies and box out our parents do not 
represent what the American people 
want. 
My colleagues across the aisle want 
you to believe that they prioritize stu-
dents and education, but the text of 
this budget reconciliation will tell a 
very different narrative. A narrative 
that expands the Federal Government’s 
role in education at the expense of 
good parenting and student outcomes. 
I, and I think my Republican col-
leagues, will oppose any proposal that 
puts the bureaucracy before students. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, last night was a great night for 
America. As Virginians across the 
Commonwealth, in bipartisan fashion, 
Republicans, Democrats, and Independ-
ents, rejected the radical, woke, social-
ist education policies of this Biden ad-
ministration and this complicit Demo-
crat majority in this Congress. 
Most of our schools will be better off 
being governed by the first seven 
ticked-off parents in line at the next 
school board meeting than the woke 
leftist, progressive, liberal members of 
the typical American school board. 
The Federal Government should not 
be involved in education. There is no 
constitutional basis for the Federal 
Government to be involved in edu-
cation to begin with. I love our friend, 
THOMAS
MASSIE, our colleague from 
Kentucky’s bill that says—of which I 
am a cosponsor—the Department of 
Education shall cease to exist on De-
cember 31 of 2022. How much better our 
schools, our children, our parents, and 
families would be if that were the case. 
We are seeing the silver lining from 
the past 2 years with the China virus as 
the exposure has been there. What is 
being taught in the schools? The strong 
disinfectant of sunlight, letting par-
ents see what their children are being 
taught as they supervise them learning 
from home. 
And, thankfully, thousands and thou-
sands of parents showing up at school 
board meetings to make their voices 
heard because they don’t want critical 
race theory and its ideology taught in 
our schools. It is amazing how the 
Democrat majority and their allies, 
their friends in the media say: That 
doesn’t exist. 
It may be true that there isn’t a class 
taught in a typical American high 
school that is called critical race the-
ory, taught an hour a day every day for 
5 days a week. Of course, that is not 
true. That is not typical. However, all 
throughout our country, critical race 
ideology, this theory that tries to de-
fine who we are as Americans: it tries 
to define Americans based on race; it 
tries to explain why we became a Na-
tion; it tries to explain why the Amer-
ican Revolution was fought; it tries to 
identify who are victims and who are 
oppressors. 
That ideology is absolutely included 
in training for teachers all across this 
country. In fact, in just the last 2 
weeks we have learned that in two of 
Virginia’s largest blue counties, Fair-
fax 
County 
and 
Loudoun 
County, 
teachers are being trained with critical 
race ideology to have that permeate all 
of their teaching through all of their 
classes. It is the lens through which 
they are taught to present the material 
to their students. 
In Fairfax County, as a matter of 
fact, it was shown with a recent article 
by the Washington Times, spent $5.5 
million dollars in the past year pur-
chasing CRT-related curriculum and 
materials for their school system. $2.5 
million of which was for—guess whose 
son in-law’s company—the attorney 
general, Merrick Garland. 
So you have parents rising up saying 
this is not what we want taught in our 
schools. Not to mention, these radical 
transgender policies that infringe upon 
the rights of the 99.9 percent of stu-
dents who just want to use the bath-
room of their choice with people of 
their own biological gender. 
In Loudoun County, a county that 
has become notorious around the coun-
try because of this, we have a county 
where they have a male student who 
goes into the women’s restroom and 
commits sexual assault. It was not ex-
posed as it should have been and dealt 
with as it should have been. He trans-
ferred to another school where another 
assault takes place. 
After that occurs, the parent of the 
first student victim shows up at a 
school board meeting, understandably 
upset, surprisingly restrained from how 
upset a parent must be. What did we 
do? We arrest the parent at the school 
board meeting. 
After both of those assaults took 
place, that very school board passes 
their official transgender policy allow-
ing male students who want to identify 
as female students to access those rest-
rooms. 
In addition, throughout the country, 
we are making children, who now we 
want to vaccinate, they are almost no 
risk from the China virus, but we are 
making these children wear masks all 
day long despite there being almost no 
evidence that it makes any measurable 
difference for anyone to wear a mask. 
To do that to children all day long in 
a school is nothing short of child 
abuse. 
For this and many other reasons, 
Virginians across the Commonwealth 
rose up and said no to that and elected 
a Governor, a Lieutenant Governor, an 
attorney general, and a new Virginia 
House of Delegates that will say no to 
the radical views of the majority Dem-
ocrat Party today in Virginia, that is 
aligned with the radical views on edu-
cation and otherwise, here in this 
Chamber and in this town and in this 
administration. 
When I ran for office 2 years ago, I 
identified immigration, our fiscal situ-
ation and our spending, and education 
as the three most critical issues, the 
greatest threats to the future of our 
country. Our children are our most pre-
cious resource and they are truly our 
future. Our children’s education is the 
one thing where those who hold all the 
levers of power here in Washington 
and—at least until January—in my 
home State of Virginia, they tell us: 
You must pay for it with compulsory 
taxes, but you have no say in that 
product that you are purchasing. In 
fact, the losing—thank God—the losing 
gubernatorial candidate in Virginia

who was resoundingly rejected, who 
tried to nationalize the election by 
bringing in all the heavy-hitters, the 
former President, the current Presi-
dent, the current Vice President, the 
losing candidate said: Parents, you got 
no say. It is none of your business. Give 
us your money. We will teach your 
kids. We will decide what they learn. 
We will decide the policies. If you show 
up to the school board systems, what 
we will do is identify you as a domestic 
terrorist and we will sic the FBI and 
the attorney general on you. Ameri-
cans and Virginians said no. They also 
said no in New Jersey. And they are 
going to say no throughout this coun-
try next year. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the time and effort by my 
colleague from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), 
for leading the charge on this. 
So what are we looking at here? Par-
ents, their kids, they have the perfect 
right to know what is going on in the 
schools and what the kids will be sub-
ject to during those seven or so hours 
per day that we entrust that system 
with our kids. Indeed, this is a cov-
enant we have had for many, many 
years. 
Parents and families with the school 
system, with the government, that 
they are going to do the things and 
teach our kids and treat our kids in a 
way that we approve as parents during 
those hours a day in those formative 
years, all those hours they have to-
gether that they are not under our di-
rect watch or supervision. 
So what is this all about? The direc-
tion it is going right now is indeed very 
disturbing. As we saw last night just 
across the river over in Virginia, an 
issue has been brought to a head by 
two different Governor candidates, and 
a lot of people going before that, to ex-
press their views in a First Amendment 
fashion to their school boards that 
they elect to do the job for them. 
Over here in Virginia we saw a real 
ground swell of things that we will be 
seeing a lot more of across this coun-
try. Indeed, we are seeing it in my own 
district at home. People saying no to 
what is being forced upon them in my 
own State by our Governor and a lot of 
health systems on the vaccine mandate 
for vaccines that are really unproven 
still for kids. 
In information that I saw today, it 
says the down-sized vaccine for 5- to 11- 
year-olds probably doesn’t really pre-
vent anything, but it just may lessen 
their symptoms if they get the virus. 
Well, maybe parents would like to opt 
out of that. Maybe that is not some-
thing that is good enough for their kids 
given the offsetting possible risks. It 
comes back to: Whose kids are they? 
Going back to simpler and earlier 
times when the first settlers of this 
country came across and were settling 
in the West, and as the first rough-
necks and those went and set up min-
ing and cattle and settling in the West. 
Settling this Nation. They would then 
send for people to operate their schools 
as they got married and started fami-
lies. A lot of one-room schoolhouses. I 
know that is not what we have right 
now, and, oh, he is getting all nostalgic 
and all that stuff. No. 
Could you imagine that those pio-
neers would put up with the idea that 
you are not allowed to know what is 
going on in your school. You are not 
allowed to know the curriculum. You 
are not allowed to know what school 
activities are going on, or the medical 
or health issues that your kids are 
going through. Can you imagine that 
back then? Can you imagine those pio-
neers, those settlers, those early colo-
nials, even just 50 years ago, can you 
imagine they would put up with that? 
We have been lulled to sleep by al-
lowing the system to do what it does. 
Well, people are speaking out, they are 
fighting back, and saying, no, we are 
not putting up with this anymore be-
cause the education system has gotten 
away from them. 
We have seen it. We saw it at the 
school board meetings in Virginia, and 
we see it all over the country. I am see-
ing it my district in northern Cali-
fornia. They are going to these meet-
ings and demanding to know what it is 
you are teaching them. 
As 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
MILLER, mentioned a little bit ago, it is 
amazing to watch when the parents— 
which really takes some guts—stand up 
publicly and read back to the board 
some of the content that they are find-
ing in the books that are in the library 
or even in direct curriculum, with the 
explicit sexual nature of what is being 
said and taught to kids at a very young 
age. 
b 1800 
It is outrageous, and it makes every-
body in the audience uncomfortable, 
what is being read off there. My hat is 
off to those moms and dads who are 
standing there in public reading these 
pretty ugly things to the board so they 
have to face it and so they have to deal 
with it. 
That is putting the spotlight on what 
this is for many, many people around 
the country. It is getting people off the 
sidelines and out of their busy lives. I 
know it is tough. A lot of families have 
to do two jobs because of high taxes 
and all the other demands on them 
these days, but we have to come off the 
sidelines. 
We are seeing more and more people 
making different choices for their kids 
in schools such as charter schools and 
private schools, whatever it is, because 
they want the best for their kid. 
When you see a homeschool family, a 
charter school family, or private school 
parents doing that, they are extra dedi-
cated because they have to make an 
extra sacrifice to make sure their kids 
are getting a good education. 
And what do we get in this society 
here of public education? 
They make fun of those people. They 
say: Oh, those kids are awkward, and 
they don’t fit in. 
They are some of the best-educated 
kids you have, Madam Speaker, and 
they are the ones who are moving for-
ward to be in leadership versus the 
ones who are not given a school choice 
to break out of a bad situation. 
Especially 
in 
our 
urban 
areas, 
wouldn’t these inner-city families like 
to have choices sometimes to alter-
native education instead of the same 
thing from the same old standards? 
So we are seeing people pushing 
back, fighting back, and demanding to 
be heard because your children do not 
belong to the government. They do not 
belong to the school system. They be-
long to you, given to you by God, and 
they are your responsibility. 
So you have every right to have your 
voice heard, not to be called a terrorist 
and not to be monitored by the FBI or 
the Attorney General whose family 
might be making money off of this or 
somebody else. 
You have every right to speak out. 
So do not be cowered by the left, by the 
media, and by the big school system 
that is trying to cower you into not 
being a part of it. 
You move forward, and you be 
strong. You demand to know and de-
mand to ask better for your children 
because they are yours. They do not 
belong to the government or any edu-
cation system that is supposed to be 
working for all of us. 
So I appreciate this Special Order 
hour tonight. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I do have to say that this is 
not a Republican or Democrat issue. 
This is an issue that affects all Amer-
ican children. 
But where are the Democrat leaders? 
Why are they not speaking out on 
this? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman MILLER for her leader-
ship on this vital issue of protecting 
education. 
In their quest for absolute power, 
Democrats are not just stopping with 
doubling the size of the IRS to target 
Americans, granting mass amnesty for 
millions of illegal migrants, or impos-
ing burdensome tax hikes on workers 
and small businesses. No. They also 
plan to nationalize early education. 
The Democrats’ $1.75 trillion Big 
Government 
socialist 
spending 
bill 
aims to strip parents of their freedom 
and hand over more power to bureau-
crats and politicians in Washington. 
Under this irresponsible spending pack-
age, the Biden administration obtains 
total control in approving early child-
hood education standards while lim-
iting parents’ choice in their children’s 
education. 
Mark my words, Madam Speaker. 
The Democrats’ reckless reconciliation 
bill is a shameless ruse to indoctrinate 
America’s youth with divisive cur-
riculum and radical ideas. It is no coin-
cidence that this comes at a time when

the Department of Justice is targeting 
parents—yes, 
targeting 
parents—for 
exercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
rights to speak out against critical 
race theory curriculum and unscien-
tific mask mandates in schools. No 
wonder parents across the country are 
fed up with this nonsense. 
Parents are the primary stakeholders 
in their children’s education. It is not 
the radical left; it is not the Federal 
Government; and it is not the failed 
teachers unions. It is parents. 
By injecting woke political propa-
ganda into our schools instead of focus-
ing on beneficial subjects such as his-
tory, reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
Democrats are holding children back 
from a top-tier education. 
Additionally, 
through 
the 
Demo-
crats’ empty promise guise of afford-
able childcare, this legislation would 
actually drive childcare prices through 
the roof, forcing middle-class families 
to spend roughly $13,000 more per year. 
Simply put, the Democrats’ Big Gov-
ernment, socialist bill has the Federal 
Government’s fingerprints all over edu-
cation, which is not in accordance with 
the Constitution, and that should ter-
rify every parent across the country. 
This is one of the many reasons why 
we need to preserve school and paren-
tal choice at the local level. It will en-
sure every solitary student has the op-
portunity to receive an education that 
will adequately prepare them for the 
future and that every solitary parent 
has the choice to decide where their 
children receive that education. 
Madam Speaker, let’s empower par-
ents and not embolden the Federal 
Government. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congress-
woman MILLER’s efforts and leadership 
on this critical and vital topic. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in de-
fense of the God-given right of parents 
to guide and shape the education of 
their children. Preparing our children 
for the world and teaching them the 
skills they need to be successful adults 
is not only a parent’s right; it is also 
their responsibility. Unfortunately, it 
is one of many of our sacred rights that 
my Democrat colleagues want to rip 
away and give to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Having already corrupted our higher 
education system with anti-American 
ideology, Democrats are now pushing 
their indoctrination program down to 
K–12. This may sound like partisan 
rhetoric, but my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are hiding their 
intentions. 
Their build back broke plan includes 
a $10 billion environmental justice 
slush fund that will be used to push the 
Green New Deal in universities. They 
are 
incorporating 
divisive, 
racist 
ideologies like critical race theory into 
classrooms across the country. 
They will try to say that is not true. 
But don’t buy their lie. Regardless of 
what you name it, Madam Speaker, 
any curriculum that teaches kids that 
they are inherently racist or hopelessly 
victims simply because of the color of 
their skin is itself racist. It runs 
counter to the American ideal. That is 
not freedom of ideas. That is indoc-
trination. 
They are working actively to push 
parents out of every aspect of their 
children’s education. 
Don’t believe it. 
In Loudoun County, Virginia, just 
across the river here, any parent want-
ing to review the CRT components of 
the curriculum is required to sign a 
nondisclosure 
agreement, 
a 
legally 
binding document that forbids them 
from sharing what they find out. 
What is it in their curriculum that 
they don’t want people to find out 
about it? 
And once they find out about it, why 
don’t they want it to be shared? 
I come from Florida, a State where 
we value transparency and the sun-
shine. We have very strict sunshine 
laws. This would never fly in the State 
of Florida. We are not afraid of what 
our government is doing there. In fact, 
we want people to know more about it. 
The COVID pandemic and our coun-
try’s response to it will have long-last-
ing effects on our Nation. Perhaps one 
of the most destructive of these aspects 
is the developmental damage inflicted 
on our children because their needs 
were placed last. 
If there is any silver lining at all to 
the pandemic, it is that parents whose 
children were subjected to school shut-
downs were finally able to experience 
firsthand what they are being taught. 
They responded with anger and frustra-
tion at the politicians who have al-
lowed this travesty to occur. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Democrat 
re-
sponse to this nationwide movement 
has been to treat concerned parents as 
domestic terrorists, and they have 
weaponized the Justice Department in 
an effort to get these parents to sit 
down and shut up. 
Terry McAuliffe’s statement that he 
doesn’t believe parents should tell 
schools what to teach was a horrifying 
peer into the soul of what radical pro-
gressives truly believe, that Big Broth-
er, the Federal Government, knows 
best and should be given full autonomy 
to control our lives. 
But Virginians put the Democrats on 
notice last night. America rejects their 
efforts to ram through a toxic platform 
of cradle-to-grave government depend-
ence. This doesn’t just include Federal 
overreach in our education system but 
also in the outrageous spending pro-
grams that will destroy our economic 
prosperity. 
Democrats are trying to sell Ameri-
cans a bill of goods they don’t want, 
they can’t afford, and with money the 
country doesn’t have. 
During election years, we often ask 
the American people how they are 
doing compared to 4 years ago. I would 
ask them now: How are you doing com-
pared to 10 months ago? 
Our 
education 
system 
is 
falling 
apart, our southern border is a dis-
aster, violent crime has skyrocketed 
across the country, our botched with-
drawal from Afghanistan has dimin-
ished our standing on the world stage, 
and inflation is running 
rampant. 
Every action the Biden administration 
takes is hurting our country. Ameri-
cans know they are worse off, but 
Democrats appear to be unaware or ap-
athetic. 
As I look across the aisle, where are 
the traditional liberals? 
If you are still there, it is time to 
come out of hiding and stand up to the 
radical progressives who are destroying 
the very fabric of the country I know 
you love. Stop listening to the D.C. and 
big city echo chambers. Those are not 
the voice of America. 
Show the American people that you 
are listening to them by standing 
against divisive rhetoric in our schools, 
stopping 
outrageous 
government 
spending, 
and 
supporting 
law 
and 
order. 
Yesterday’s 
election 
should 
serve as a wake-up call to all who wish 
to save America from destruction. It is 
not too late. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to commend the Governor of 
Florida for the great example he has 
been to the rest of the States and how 
he is leading the way in education. We 
appreciate it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to put our 
kids first in education. Far-left Demo-
crats who want the government and 
teachers unions in charge of what chil-
dren are taught have been working 
overtime to strip parents of their 
rights. Within their boondoggle tax- 
and-spend 
agenda, 
Democrats 
have 
slipped in a quiet government takeover 
of our schools. Ultimately, this would 
ensure Washington bureaucrats and 
teachers unions have a larger influence 
on shaping a child’s upbringing than 
their parents. 
Under 
the 
Democrats’ 
monstrous 
multitrillion-dollar socialist spending 
bill is a provision that creates uni-
versal daycare and preschool and would 
allow the government to decide what 
children are taught, where they will 
spend their time, and who can teach 
and care for them. 
This is simply wrong. It is not fair, 
and it violates the trust we put in our 
schools. 
When it comes to their children’s 
education, parents and families deserve 
more control, not less. We have already 
seen what government-controlled edu-
cation looks like as government-run 
public schools fail to teach children 
basic skills. 
Worse, Democrats are using the pub-
lic education system to push leftwing 
ideologies and divisive curricula like 
critical race theory and the histori-
cally inaccurate 1619 Project, which do

nothing but pollute the minds of our 
young children. 
Parents and families deserve schools 
they can trust. As one of the Rep-
resentatives for Tennessee and as the 
father of two young children, I am 
working to put power back into the 
hands of parents, families, and local 
school leaders. 
Let’s make student welfare and tra-
ditional education the only special in-
terest we fund and promote when it 
comes to our children’s schools, not 
leftwing efforts to turn schools into far 
left, ideological indoctrination centers. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. To con-
clude, Madam Speaker, I want to say 
that we want our children to be smart; 
we want them to master the core sub-
jects; and we want them to love their 
neighbor and their country. 
Please do not underestimate the 
power of regular people to defend their 
children and their country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

TOXIC MILITARY BURN PITS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) 
for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to tell the story of my con-
stituent, Jennifer Kepner and to call 
for immediate action on the most 
pressing public health issue facing our 
veterans: toxic military burn pits. 
Four years ago, I met a veteran 
named Jennifer Kepner at her home in 
Cathedral City, California, in my dis-
trict. Jennifer, a 39-year-old mother of 
two, was one of the most inspiring and 
brave people I have ever met, and that 
kitchen table conversation was one of 
the most impactful conversations in 
my life. 
When I met her, she was cachectic. 
You could see her bones. She was wast-
ing away. She was battling pancreatic 
cancer and was on chemotherapy. You 
could see the port in her chest and you 
could see the loss of hair. And she was 
still so very full of energy inside to tell 
her story and sound the alarm. 
Her doctor linked her exposure to 
burn pits during her service overseas. 
You see, she was described as a health 
nut, as someone thin, healthy, who 
liked to run, and jog. Her friends would 
say: She was one of those crazy people 
who would wake up at 4 in the morning 
and go on a 5-mile run routinely. 
So when she came down with pan-
creatic cancer at such a young age, her 
physicians looked at her DNA, her fam-
ily history, and they concluded that 
the most likely cause, given her low 
risk, was her exposure to toxic mili-
tary burn pit smoke. 
I sat with her in her home as she told 
me her story. She told me about her 
military service as an Air Force medic 
caring for our men and women in uni-
form who were injured or sick. You see, 
she was stationed at Balad Air Base in 
Iraq. She told me about her husband 
and their two children, Adia and 
Wyatt, who she loved so very dearly. 
She told me about burn pits, these 
huge fields where the military burns 
trash—anything 
and 
everything—in-
cluding batteries, jet fuel, medical 
waste, plastics, and other hazardous 
material causing servicemembers to in-
hale toxic chemicals, carcinogens, and 
particulate matter. 
They call it the crud, you see, be-
cause after a long day in the desert 
serving our country, they go to their 
camp wanting a little rest, and they 
smell this black toxic chemical smoke 
and they get the soot on their face, in 
their nostrils, in their throat. They 
have itchy eyes, a runny nose, a sore 
throat. They cough, and that is just an-
other day at a base serving our coun-
try. 
Jennifer spent her last month as a 
leading voice for her fellow veterans 
exposed to burn pits which she called 
‘‘the Agent Orange of our generation.’’ 
Wow. ‘‘The Agent Orange of our gen-
eration.’’ We all are infuriated with the 
way that our Vietnam veterans were 
denied and their care was delayed and 
their recognition had been postponed 
when they were saying, ‘‘We are sick.’’ 
Their children are born malformed. 
They are infertile. They have other 
issues and syndromes and symptoms 
that are life-threatening and debili-
tating. 
She is saying that this is the Agent 
Orange of our generation, and she knew 
that she was going to die. She knew 
that her days were limited. She knew 
that pancreatic cancer is the most ag-
gressive cancer that causes death with-
in months after diagnosis. 
She didn’t give up. She didn’t give 
up, despite the VA denying her the rec-
ognition that it was the burn pits that 
caused her pancreatic cancer. She 
didn’t give up. Despite the VA denying 
her the benefits that she needed for her 
family, she didn’t give up. Her dying 
wish was to ensure two things: one, was 
that other veterans didn’t have to 
struggle through a system that denied 
and delayed and did not recognize her 
illness so that she said: Let’s help 
other veterans. 
The second was: Please help my hus-
band, Ben, get the benefits to care for 
my children. In her last dying days she 
was thinking of others with that heart 
of a servant and the fierce determina-
tion of a warrior. 
I remember getting the call when I 
was in my district office that she was 
dying, and she would potentially die 
within a few hours. 
I fell to my knees and I cried. I com-
posed myself and I thought, as a physi-
cian, there are only certain things that 
I can do in the art and science of medi-
cine, but I know that there is a greater 
healer; that there is a greater power, 
and perhaps this is what I can bring to 
serve the family at this moment. So I 
invited my pastor, Gerald Sharon, to 
come with me so that we could pray 
with her on her deathbed. 
There she was, taking her last 
breaths. Her mother was there crying. 
Her husband was trying to keep it to-
gether. Her children were at her side. 
The youngest one was too young to un-
derstand what was happening. The 
older one, the daughter, was a little 
more aware, but she was trying to keep 
it together. 
We did our prayer, and she died on 
October 18, 2017. Since then, it has been 
my mission to make her vision a re-
ality. 
Her story drove me to found the bi-
partisan, bicameral Congressional Burn 
Pits Caucus with my friend and col-
league Congressman BRAD WENSTRUP 
from Ohio. 
Her story inspired me to work with 
brilliant minds across the aisle like my 
friend who is sitting here, Representa-
tive GUS BILIRAKIS, to introduce legis-
lation in a bipartisan manner. 
And her strength inspired me to co-
author my bipartisan, bicameral legis-
lation, the Presumptive Benefits for 
War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and 
Other Toxins Act, to get veterans the 
benefits and care they have earned and 
need and deserve. 
Her vision is reflected in the Hon-
oring Our Promise to Address Com-
prehensive Toxics Act, or the Honoring 
Our PACT Act, which includes my leg-
islation to keep our Nation’s promise 
to our veterans to take care of them 
after they serve our Nation. 
Her stories and the countless stories 
of other veterans that you will hear 
today by Republicans and Democrats 
are speaking to us beyond the grave to 
act now with urgency for their fellow 
veterans and for their families. Under 
the leadership of our great chairman of 
the 
VA 
Committee, 
Chair 
MARK 
TAKANO, we will get this done. 
We cannot sit by while the veterans 
Jennifer served with are denied the 
healthcare and benefits they have 
earned and deserve. No one who has 
served and sacrificed for our Nation 
should have to face the trials that she 
endured to get the medical care that 
she needed, or their widows the bene-
fits to support their families with a life 
of dignity. 
In 1 week, we will celebrate Veterans 
Day and show our appreciation for all 
of those who served our Nation in our 
Armed Forces. Some will wear red, 
white, and blue attire. Some will even 
go as far as to make public displays of 
hugging a flag, and some will always 
say the same old thing: Thank you to 
our veterans. Thank you to our vet-
erans for your service.

November 3, 2021 
I have said consistently that our vet-
erans appreciate the thanks but they 
really need pragmatic support. 
On Memorial Day, the way we memo-
rialize and honor the dead is by serving 
the living and improving their lives. 
They might have survived the battle-
field, but they are dying from their ex-
posures of a self-inflicted Department 
of Defense wound to our men and 
women in uniform by using these burn 
pits that, by the way, are illegal and 
banned in the United States precisely 
for their public health hazards. 
We need pragmatic support, not lip 
service or empty gestures in our appre-
ciation and celebration on Veterans 
Day. We must act now and get our vet-
erans the healthcare and benefits they 
have earned when we sent them to war 
for our country. 
Servicemembers are returning home 
from the battlefield right now only to 
become delayed casualties of war, 
dying years later from constrictive 
bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, brain 
cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic can-
cer, gastric cancers, and autoimmune 
diseases caused by their exposure to 
the toxic, hundreds of chemicals from 
burned plastics, jet fuels, and haz-
ardous materials that they inhaled 
while serving our Nation. 
The DOD and the VA cannot continue 
to neglect this self-inflicted wound on 
our veterans. So in Jennifer’s name 
and the countless names of the vet-
erans who have suffered and some suc-
cumbed to their illnesses due to their 
exposures to burn pits, we all will con-
tinue fighting tooth and nail to protect 
our servicemembers and our veterans 
from toxic burn pits. 
She would never turn her back on a 
fellow veteran, and as a nation, neither 
can we. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), my friend, my 
neighbor, and the chairman of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, a 
true champion for our veterans and the 
sponsor of Honoring our PACT Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my neighbor and very good 
friend, Dr. RAUL RUIZ, for holding and 
hosting this Special Order hour on 
toxic exposures. 
Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to 
talk about the urgent need to finally 
recognize toxic exposure as a cost of 
war and pass the Honoring Our PACT 
Act. 
Every day I hear from more and more 
veterans who have been exposed to 
toxic substances while serving our Na-
tion. Whether it is exposure to burn 
pits, contaminated water, radiation, or 
other toxins, the health effects are 
often severe from chronic multisymp-
tom illnesses, to cancers, birth defects, 
infertility, and respiratory conditions. 
This problem isn’t new, and neither 
is the need for congressional interven-
tion. As chairman of the House Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, I was 
proud to lead the effort last Congress 
to pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam 
Veterans Act and get long-overdue jus-
tice for our Vietnam veterans exposed 
to Agent Orange. But that took more 
than 40 years. We cannot let our post- 
9/11 veterans suffer the same fate. And, 
yes, we are in danger of having burn 
pits become this generation of vet-
erans’ Agent Orange. 
We cannot allow this generation of 
veterans to go the 40 years that our 
Vietnam veterans had to wait for their 
justice. 
b 1830 
When we send our servicemembers 
into harm’s way, we do so with a prom-
ise to care for them and pay for that 
care. We haven’t been keeping up our 
end of the deal. Hundreds of thousands 
of veterans have signed up for VA’s 
burn pit registry. However, with 70 per-
cent of burn pit claims denied, it is 
clear that VA’s current claims process 
isn’t working. No veteran should be 
forced to prove that their government 
exposed them to toxic substances. The 
Honoring our PACT Act fixes that and 
finally makes good on our promise. 
With our bipartisan legislation, we 
can deliver VA benefits and care to up 
to 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn 
pits and airborne hazards. We can es-
tablish a presumption of service con-
nection for 23 respiratory illnesses and 
cancers, the most comprehensive list 
out there. Additionally, we can stream-
line VA’s review process for toxic expo-
sure presumptions, so Congress doesn’t 
have to keep intervening. 
With the exit from Afghanistan still 
fresh in our minds, we cannot forget 
that the true cost of war is so much 
more than the tanks, planes, and weap-
ons used on the battlefield. Veterans 
living with toxic exposure are still in 
the heat of battle, and they are paying 
for the cost of war that our Nation 
should be paying. That is why we need 
to pass the Honoring our PACT Act 
into law. With 60 cosponsors, bipar-
tisan support, endorsements from nine 
veteran services organizations, and a 
VA Secretary and President who are 
committed to addressing this issue, we 
have the momentum to get this done. 
With every day that passes, more 
veterans get sick and, sadly, die wait-
ing for the care and benefits they have 
earned. We must act now. I want to 
thank Dr. RUIZ and the Congressional 
Burn Pits Caucus for partnering with 
my committee to share the stories of 
toxic-exposed veterans today and show-
case how transformative passing the 
Honoring our PACT Act will be. 
With Veterans Day right around the 
corner, we can honor our veterans’ 
service with action. I urge all Members 
to consider sponsoring our legislation. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO), 
my friend, who is a member of the Con-
gressional Burn Pits Caucus. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congressman RUIZ for 
organizing this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to share 
the story of Marine Corporal William 
Garza, Jr. 
William joined the Marines in the 
summer before 9/11. His first deploy-
ment was to Iraq in 2003, where he par-
ticipated in the fall of Baghdad. It was 
there, during war, where he was ex-
posed to burn pits. 
When I met William, he told me that 
he and his fellow marines would sleep 
and work around burn pits 24/7. These 
burn pits were as big as football fields, 
burning tires, human waste, metals, 
and electronics. William, like many 
servicemembers, didn’t know the dan-
gers of burn pit exposure. 
After serving his country with honor, 
he returned home to Texas, and he 
soon met the love of his life, Melanie, 
and they would marry, buy a home, and 
start living their American Dream. 
Soon after his marriage, William de-
veloped a sore on his tongue, but he 
struggled to get an appointment with 
the VA. When he did, it confirmed his 
worst fear: cancer. 
He 
would 
receive 
treatment 
at 
Brooke Army Medical Center, where 
the doctors would perform a miracle 
throat cancer treatment. William beat 
cancer. 
Then, a few years later, he received 
terrible news during a VA checkup. He 
had two tumors in his lungs, and he 
would need immediate treatment. 
But then, making matters worse, he 
received a letter from the VA denying 
his service-connected disability claim. 
This time around the chemo and 
immunotherapy would not be as suc-
cessful, and his cancer spread. On 
March 4, 2019, in San Antonio, Texas, 
William died, and our Nation lost a 
hero. 
His mother, Rose, who I had the 
pleasure of speaking with, calls him 
‘‘William, my Hero.’’ 
Marine Corporal William Garza, Jr., 
deserved better. 
I hope William’s story creates an ur-
gency in Congress to address this gen-
eration’s Agent Orange. 
Burn pits have destroyed service-
members’ lives and American families. 
Let’s not let another veteran receive a 
denial of benefits letter. Let’s work to-
gether to honor our Nation’s sacred ob-
ligation to our men and women in uni-
form. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), my friend and colleague, a 
member of the Congressional Burn Pits 
Caucus, and a fierce advocate for our 
veterans. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my good friend, Dr. 
RUIZ, for organizing this very impor-
tant Special Order. I know he is a ter-
rific doctor, and the fact that he has 
sacrificed to be here, to complete the 
mission. I appreciate it so very much. I 
have a similar story as well, but we 
must complete this mission as soon as 
possible. As Jennifer said, this is the 
Agent Orange of our era. 
Providing the care and support for 
our veterans, our Nation’s heroes, has 
been one of my top priorities since I 
was elected to Congress, and I will con-
tinue to fight to ensure that our vet-
erans get the benefits they deserve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6173 
November 3, 2021 
As a matter of fact, after one of our 
hearings a few years ago on the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, we had 
many veterans who were exposed to 
Agent Orange. Their families were 
present with them, their children were 
present with them, and I invited them 
into my office. One-on-one, they told 
me the stories of what happened. The 
spouses would tell me: my husband, my 
wife, was exposed, and now he or she 
can’t work. Who is going to support the 
family? What is going to happen to 
these children if their father or mother 
passes away? Who is going to take care 
of them? They need healthcare now. 
They need their benefits now. 
We can’t wait any longer, Madam 
Speaker. Burn pits are the Agent Or-
ange of our era, as Jennifer said. And 
the fact that we haven’t resolved the 
issue of burn pit exposure is an abso-
lute disservice to our veterans. They 
were exposed, and we must help them. 
I have fought for over multiple Con-
gresses, with my colleague Dr. RUIZ 
and my colleague BRAD WENSTRUP from 
the great State of Ohio, leading and 
sponsoring numerous pieces of legisla-
tion to get toxic-exposed veterans the 
treatment and benefits they deserve, 
because many cannot afford to wait 
any longer. 
Tragically, one of our veterans came 
to me a few years ago, Lauren Price. 
Similar to Dr. RUIZ and Jennifer, we 
made it our mission to get this done. 
During Lauren’s service to our coun-
try, she was exposed to burn pits. This 
past spring, she sadly passed away due 
to an illness linked to her burn pit ex-
posure, but not before taking up the 
cause for her fellow veterans to make 
sure they or their families would not 
have to experience the same suffering 
she and her family experienced. Lauren 
knew that she was going to pass away, 
but she wanted to make it better for 
her fellow veterans. Her goal was to 
pass this legislation and similar legis-
lation that Dr. RUIZ and I have cospon-
sored over the years. 
I was incredibly moved to see her 
husband and my good friend, Jim 
Price, continue this tireless advocacy 
by testifying as a witness before the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee just this 
past year in support of the TEAM Act, 
which would comprehensively address 
toxic exposures now and in the future. 
This critical bill adopts provisions 
for my legislation that I previously au-
thored, the Protection for Veterans’ 
Burn Pit Exposure Act. 
I urge Congress to take up and pass 
the TEAM Act immediately. If we are 
going to be spending money, Madam 
Speaker, let’s spend it on our heros. 
I am also proud to co-lead a host of 
additional burn pit legislative fixes 
with Dr. RUIZ and urge immediate ac-
tion in the House and Senate on H.R. 
4398, H.R. 4397, H.R. 2432, and H.R. 2371. 
While both H.R. 4398 and H.R. 4397 
were included in the House version of 
the NDAA, we must continue pushing 
until they are across the finish line and 
signed by the President. 
Again, I thank my good friend, Dr. 
RUIZ, for organizing this Special Order. 
I can’t think of a more worthy cause 
than providing for these veterans in 
their time of need, just as they pro-
vided for our country when we needed 
them. Let’s get this done for our vet-
erans. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), 
who I am proud to have join me as a 
cosponsor of the Honoring our PACT 
Act and a member of the bipartisan 
Congressional Burn Pits Caucus. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia for his leadership. I want to 
thank Chairman TAKANO, who has been 
responsible for really taking care of 
the veterans. He helped us rename our 
clinic back in Youngstown after Carl 
Nunziato, who is a tremendous Viet-
nam veteran. I also want to thank the 
gentleman from Cincinnati, my home 
State, for being a part of all of this and 
being a leader in all of this. I want to 
thank him for that. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in 
honor of the memory of Ohio Army 
Guardsman Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson. I met Heath’s daughter, 
Brielle, a few months back and heard 
the story of Heath from his mother-in- 
law, Susan. 
These stories, as you have heard to-
night, 
are 
heartbreaking. 
Because 
when you look at Brielle and his wife, 
Danielle, this is more than just we 
have got to get something fixed to take 
care of a veteran who served their 
country. This is the modern version of 
Agent Orange. 
But this is bringing so much heart-
break to so many families and to so 
many communities in States like Ohio 
where we have so many veterans who 
served their country. 
On March 21, 2017, Heath and his wife, 
Danielle, were sitting in an exam room 
at Zangmeister Cancer Center in Co-
lumbus, Ohio, when Heath was given a 
terminal diagnosis. He had only 6 
weeks to live. 
At only 35 years old, Heath was suf-
fering from gushing nosebleeds and 
bleeding from his ears. Dozens of doc-
tors were unable to provide answers, 
but they all did have one question: 
What in the hell have you been exposed 
to? 
It turns out that Heath, a combat 
medic, had spent every day for 3 
months within 15 yards of a massive 
burn pit at Camp Liberty complex in 
Iraq. 
Heath was afflicted with a rare auto-
immune disease that mostly strikes el-
derly women and an extremely rare 
form of lung cancer that, according to 
20 oncologists, could have only been 
caused by a prolonged exposure and in-
halation of toxic substances. 
Madam Speaker, how can we pretend 
that both the VA and we, as a Nation, 
do not owe the veterans like Heath and 
their families both the care and the 
benefits that they have earned, often 
with their very lives? This is not who 
we are as a country. 
We have got to fix this in Congress. 
The time is now. Not next year, not 5 
years from now, but now, right now. 
Servicemembers 
like 
Heath, 
and 
countless others, thousands, maybe 
tens of thousands, spent the last 20 
years fighting our Nation’s longest 
war. We cannot turn our backs on 
them. 
I have introduced legislation to help 
collect the data so that the VA has it 
and that every 3 months they report to 
this Congress as to what the data is 
and what the claims are so we can hold 
them accountable. 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
Danielle, I want to thank Susan. And I 
want to let Brielle and Danielle and 
Susan know, and their family, that 
there are so many prayers coming to 
them from this Congress. 
But we are going to get it done, and 
we are going to get it done soon. It is 
going to be a bipartisan effort with 
guys like the gentleman from Cin-
cinnati and the gentleman from Cali-
fornia and myself. Let’s get this thing 
done. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP), the co-chair of the bi-
partisan Congressional Burn Pits Cau-
cus. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, we 
are here tonight to recognize and bring 
awareness to our servicemembers who 
are dealing with health issues caused 
by exposure to burn pits and other tox-
ins during their tour of duty. 
These brave men and women an-
swered the call. They were willing to 
lay down their lives for our freedom, 
and they served us honorably. 
Unknowingly, by following orders, 
they put themselves in harm’s way. 
As our military continues to adapt, 
we are learning that certain amounts 
of exposure to burn pits can potentially 
present troublesome and life-threat-
ening health challenges, some that 
don’t show up until later in life. 
When I served in Iraq, I smelled the 
smoke, and I don’t wish it upon any-
one. Those suffering from the repercus-
sions of burn pit exposure need help, 
not hurdles. We must meet them with 
compassion, not red tape. That is why 
I am proud to work with fellow mem-
bers of the Congressional Burn Pit Cau-
cus, as well as friends on the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, to put forth bipar-
tisan solutions to help our servicemem-
bers. We must prevent this in the fu-
ture and care for those that have borne 
the battle. 
I want to thank my friend, Dr. RUIZ, 
for hosting this Special Order. I am 
proud to work with him on this issue, 
as I have been proud to work with him 
on so many other issues on behalf of 
patients. 
b 1845 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? Do I 
have 1 minute remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired.

H6174 
November 3, 2021 
Mrs. 
DINGELL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
month, we will pause on November 11th to 
honor the men and women who have self-
lessly served America in uniform. Veterans of 
the United States Armed Forces have dedi-
cated their lives to protecting our nation, and 
it is critical we express our sincere gratitude 
for the sacrifices they have made. 
I appreciate the opportunity to draw aware-
ness to a critical issue affecting both veterans 
and current servicemembers—toxic exposure. 
Toxic 
exposure 
has 
affected 
U.S. 
servicemembers for generations. While each 
war and conflict has posed unique hazards 
and health risks for servicemembers, our na-
tion’s youngest veterans are increasingly fac-
ing health consequences due to exposure to 
toxic chemicals during their military service in 
the Middle East. 
Over the past two decades in the Middle 
East, open burn pits were commonly used as 
disposal sites for materials such as trash, 
weapons, 
batteries, 
and 
other 
waste. 
Servicemembers are concerned about the ill-
nesses that are linked to exposure to the toxic 
fumes and smoke emitted by these burn pits, 
especially as some have begun developing 
rare cancers and illnesses at higher rates than 
their counterparts that were deployed to other 
parts of the world. 
Michigan-native Kevin Hensley is one such 
veteran who has been deeply impacted by 
burn pits. Kevin is a veteran of the U.S. Air 
Force who was deployed to the Middle East 
eight times and stationed near open air burn 
pits during four of his deployments. After retir-
ing and moving back to Wayne County in 
2015, Kevin’s health began rapidly deterio-
rating. By 2017, Kevin had been diagnosed 
with Constrictive Bronchiolitis, and later brain 
scans revealed serious damage from inhaling 
toxic smoke. 
Kevin struggles with daily tasks, saying he 
finds it difficult to go grocery shopping without 
gasping for air. Equally upsetting, Kevin has 
faced challenges receiving care through the 
VA. Only in 2020 did the VA formally expand 
benefits for veterans suffering with illnesses 
related to exposure to burn pits. Still, veterans 
must shoulder a burden of proof, which re-
quires them to precisely pinpoint where and 
when they may have been exposed to burn 
pits. As a result, the VA continues to deny an 
overwhelming number of burn-pit related dis-
ability claims. 
Unfortunately, Kevin’s story is one of far too 
many. Our nation’s veterans deserve better, 
and we must recommit ourselves to this effort 
to ensure veterans receive the benefits and 
care they’re entitled to. 
That’s why I’m a proud cosponsor of H.R. 
3967, the Honoring Our Promises to Address 
Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021. This bi-
partisan bill will provide vital support to vet-
erans who have been exposed to burn pits 
and other toxins and ensure they can access 
crucial healthcare services through the VA. 
I thank Rep. RUIZ for his steadfast leader-
ship on toxic exposure and burn pits. I urge all 
my colleagues to support this important legis-
lation and continue pursuing other legislative 
solutions that will ensure our servicemembers 
have access to the healthcare they deserve. 
f 
DO BETTER FOR VETERANS 
(Mr. WELCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
WELCH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Vermonters have done their full meas-
ure of service throughout our history, 
and that is true in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. Two of our great soldiers, Ser-
geant Major Michael Cram and Briga-
dier General Michael Heston, both died 
of cancers that we believe were related 
to their exposures to burn pits. 
Their wonderful widows, Pat Cram 
and June Heston, have been so vigilant 
and energetic in putting a focus on the 
devastation of these burn pits and 
played a major role in encouraging the 
VA to, A, get a registry; B, the Defense 
Department to stop exposing people to 
burn pits; and then, C, to have us pre-
sume that those who have been exposed 
to burn pits and developed a disease as 
a result of that are entitled to VA ben-
efits. We must get this done. 
f 
AMERICA’S BUDGET WOES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
as we get ourselves sort of organized, 
last Monday, I did an entire hour here 
on the floor—55 minutes—and we actu-
ally did a presentation up and down the 
budget. Not this budget cycle, but basi-
cally what does our country look like 
over the next 30 years? What is driving 
the projections of $112 trillion of debt 
29 years from now? 
Look, it is one of those presentations 
that is rather uncomfortable for most 
of us because the punch line is demo-
graphics, and that is not what we typi-
cally do here. But the reality is, we 
have a real issue. We are getting old 
very fast as a society. 
Let’s do a bit of a reminder here and 
actually look at the math. We are 
going to walk through a couple of these 
that are the same as last week, but the 
difference tonight is we are going to 
try to talk about a handful of solu-
tions. There is a big package of solu-
tions, and most of them are really hard 
and are really going to be cantan-
kerous around here, but there are solu-
tions to deal with. 
Let’s actually first walk through 
where we are at today. Once again, I 
won’t worry about 1965 in the mix. It is 
important that anyone watching this, 
fellow Members of Congress, under-
stand. 
Today, 2021, 77 percent of all the 
spending that will come from Wash-
ington is mandatory. Only 10 percent is 
defense; 13 percent is functionally what 
we vote on. I think there is a huge mis-
understanding in the public that we 
march off to Congress and are voting 
on these $4 trillion budgets. We are 
not. We are functionally voting on this 
little green wedge here that is discre-
tionary spending. 
So if I came to you right now and 
said, okay, what is driving the debt 
over the next 30 years? I am going to 
show you a number of slides that are 
going to show the budget is in balance 
except for two things—Social Security 
and Medicare. And it is mostly Medi-
care. 
Social Security is actually quite fix-
able. There is a number of levers. None 
of the levers will make anyone particu-
larly excited or happy, but we once cal-
culated we had 24, 26 different levers to 
make Social Security solvent and keep 
our promises. 
Remember, 
Social 
Security 
and 
Medicare are earned benefits. It is a so-
cietal contract. We have an obligation 
to be there. 
But Medicare is a really tough one, 
and we need to actually go back to 
having the honest conversation about 
what drives much of this debt. Well, if 
you see here, this is taxes paid in, ben-
efits out for Social Security. You no-
tice they are pretty much in balance. 
Social Security is a fairly square deal. 
You get a little bit of a SPIF, on aver-
age, for the average American. 
Where the numbers get really dif-
ficult is the average American couple 
is going to put in about $161,000 into 
the part A Medicare, which is only the 
trust fund for just the hospital portion. 
The pharmaceuticals, the other doctor 
visits, the other things are general 
fund. So when you are paying your 
FICA tax, you are paying this here. 
But that average couple is going to 
get $522,000 in benefits. So the differen-
tial from $161,000 to $522,000 is the driv-
er of the vast majority of U.S. sov-
ereign debt over the next 30 years. It is 
this differential here. It is not that 
complicated. 
One of the great frustrations here is 
my brothers and sisters on the left will 
come behind the microphone and say 
things like: Well, if we had Medicare 
for All, or we expanded the ACA, 
ObamaCare. That is not true. If anyone 
just takes a quick breath and steps 
back—and, 
look, 
Republicans 
are 
guilty on part of this, too. Those are fi-
nancing bills. The ACA was financing 
it, who got subsidized and who has to 
pay. Medicare for All is just a change 
of who pays. None of that is about what 
we pay. And the Republican alternative 
was the same. It was about who got 
subsidized and who had to pay. 
So what we are going to talk about 
are some of the revolutions in what we 
pay, changing the cost of healthcare. 
But we first need to understand the 
scale of these. Look, this is function-
ally the same size as we just had, but it 
is important to understand that for 
every dollar in, particularly on Medi-
care, we get $3 in benefits back. And 
now you start to do that with the de-
mographics of the country. 
This is just a graphic. So you see the 
orange here. That is us just getting 
old. That is just simply us moving into 
our 
benefit 
years. 
The 
green 
is 
healthcare costs. We have known peo-
ple were going to turn 65 for how many 
years in this country? And we are still 
avoiding the issue.

November 3, 2021 
But you start to see, when you start 
to get into the 2050s, this here, your 
country has $112 trillion of publicly 
borrowed debt, and 78 percent of that is 
just Medicare. 
This is one of the slides that I actu-
ally see in my dreams because, if you 
understand math, if you are willing to 
own a calculator, this slide should 
scare you to death. The purple is func-
tionally the borrowing of Social Secu-
rity and the interest on it. This is the 
spending of Medicare and the interest 
on that. 
You will notice in this board here 
$112 trillion of borrowing, and it is 
mostly the cost of Medicare and the fi-
nancing of that. The rest of the budget, 
if you remove Social Security and 
Medicare, is actually in balance. 
Just a quick aside before the next 
board. How many times today behind 
these microphones did anyone come up 
and say that functionally the greatest 
threat to the stability of the country is 
the fact that we have waited so long? 
We are well into the baby boom moving 
into retirement, and you start to see 
the debt curve just explode on us. 
So take a look at this board. Now, if 
you remove the pandemic years here 
and just functionally look at this 10- 
year cycle, why this is important—I 
know there are a lot of numbers and a 
lot of colors here. This board is basi-
cally saying one very simple thing. The 
vast majority, matter of fact, almost 
the entire debt for this decade and the 
decade after that and the decade after 
that, but for this decade is driven sole-
ly by Social Security and Medicare. 
Think of that. In functionally 9 budg-
et years, your country is scheduled to 
have functionally about $2.2 trillion of 
borrowing, just borrowing every year, 
and almost all of that just came from 
Social Security and Medicare. 
And look, dear Lord, please don’t let 
interest rates move against us, but you 
start to actually see the Medicare out-
lays, the Medicare revenues, and then 
you get these arguments saying, well, 
if you would adjust defense. Well, de-
fense is lying down here, and you start 
to realize—excuse me, the Medicare 
taxes and those are down here. You 
start to look at these gaps. This is 
where we are at. 
Sorry, I was skipping ahead a board. 
If you were to eliminate the entire de-
fense budget—so let’s just wipe out the 
defense budget—you realize it buys you 
a year or two, but that is about it be-
cause this is the projected defense line, 
and this is Social Security and Medi-
care where we are going. 
You would think, Members of Con-
gress, if you actually cared about keep-
ing our promises that we are going to 
protect Social Security, we are going 
to protect Medicare, how come every 
Member of Congress isn’t walking be-
hind this microphone holding up these 
boards and saying we are going to work 
on a solution to this? Instead, this is 
almost toxic around here. 
I can’t tell you how many Members I 
run into who say, DAVID, I want to talk 
about the debt and deficits, too, and 
the fact that as we grab all the capital 
stock of the country, and maybe the 
world, that we are going to slow down 
the economy, that we are going to be 
poorer. Poor people will be poorer; rich 
people will be poorer. The country’s 
productivity will be crushed. Oh, but I 
can’t actually talk about the drivers of 
the debt. 
I am going to actually say there are 
solutions. There is a way to actually 
start to take a step back and say, if we 
are willing to have an honest moment 
and say, okay, because the vast major-
ity of Medicare is a general fund ex-
penditure, what do we do? It is com-
plicated. There are lots of parts of it. 
But let’s first understand. There is a 
rule about healthcare, and this is not 
only Medicare, Medicaid, VA, and In-
dian Health Services, but everything. 
Five percent of the population is over 
50 percent of the spending. So if you 
love and care about people, but you 
also 
care 
about 
spending 
and 
healthcare costs, we need to under-
stand the 5 percent of our brothers and 
sisters who drive most of our spending 
but also are the folks often living in 
absolute misery. 
It turns out if you are willing to 
spend and invest to end people’s mis-
ery, it ends up being a way you can ac-
tually also take on that debt and def-
icit. 
Look, Republicans often come behind 
these microphones, and we have all 
sorts of ideas. My suggestion is we do 
all of them, but we need to be realistic. 
Just as some of my Democratic col-
leagues will walk behind a microphone 
and say, well, if we had Medicare for 
All—back to the comment before, it is 
a financing bill. It doesn’t actually 
change the cost of procedures. Unless 
they are willing to ratchet down and go 
into rationing, which they swear they 
won’t, it is just an alternative way of 
paying for it. 
Then we have Republicans who will 
come here and say, well, price trans-
parency, I love price transparency. But 
the best peer-reviewed academic stud-
ies out there, it is only 0.1 to 0.7 per-
cent 
improvement 
on 
price 
for 
healthcare costs. 
Now, you still should do it, but if you 
really want to start thinking about 
things that drive healthcare costs, 
what would happen if I came to you 
and said—you saw in that previous 
board—what?—it was about $78 trillion 
of borrowing, just borrowing is Medi-
care over the next 29, 30 years. 
Thirty-one percent of Medicare is 
just diabetes. Thirty-one percent of 
Medicare cost is diabetes, and that is 
just Medicare. We haven’t done the 
math for Medicaid, for Indian Health 
Services, for VA, for just the general 
populations. 
b 1900 
But it helps you start to think about, 
okay, we know chronic conditions, 5 
percent is over 50 percent of spending. 
We know in Medicare 31 percent is just 
diabetes. Maybe we are starting to un-
derstand the drivers of what actually 
consumes our healthcare costs. 
My proposal to anyone that is willing 
to hear is let’s actually do something 
fairly radical—the concept of stepping 
up 
and 
legalizing 
technology 
in 
healthcare but also investing in disrup-
tion. 
Right now, the left actually has some 
proposals that would functionally do 
some weird, quirky things such as, as 
soon as a drug comes off exclusivity, 
they are going to start to tax it, and 
hopefully that taxing actually starts 
now to move to create generics or force 
the one over here to become less expen-
sive now because it is all functionally 
exclusivity off-patent, and I would like 
radically different thinking. 
How about investing in absolutely 
curative disrupting research in drugs 
but also technology? 
Let’s actually walk through some-
thing that I find fascinating—and this 
board is a little hard because there is a 
lot of noise on it—but 16 percent of 
U.S. healthcare expenses is people not 
taking their drug appropriately. Think 
of that. That is like $550 billion a year. 
So over half a trillion dollars a year is 
when someone doesn’t take their hy-
pertension medicine and then they 
have a stroke. 
It turns out the fastest thing you can 
do tomorrow is the technology that ac-
tually helps people know that they 
should have taken their hypertension 
pill or their insulin at a certain time, 
the technology—because this is 16 per-
cent of all healthcare. 
If tomorrow you could remind grand-
ma to take her medicines at the proper 
times during the day, someone with 
hypertension that they took their pills 
so they don’t have a stroke, 16 percent 
of healthcare. And we have real simple 
technologies out there. We have the 
pill bottle cap that talks to you and re-
minds you that says, hey, you didn’t 
open me today. 
For someone that may have multiple 
pills at certain times of the day, you 
actually now have—and there are ap-
parently all sorts of versions of this 
now—that drop the pill in the bottle 
and send you a text message, sends 
your grandkids a text message also to 
know that the pills are there. 
The technology is here, and almost 
no one ever thinks about personal tech-
nology like this as a way to crash the 
price in healthcare. But it is 16 per-
cent. It is $550 billion in a single year, 
not 10 years, in a single year. So over 
half a trillion dollars a year you can 
strip out of healthcare costs if you 
could just get our brothers and sisters 
to take their pharmaceuticals in a way 
that keeps them healthy. 
Now for some more radical proposals, 
so far this year, there are two papers 
out, one U.S.-based and actually one 
Taiwanese-based, but both from very 
prestigious universities. They appear 
to be peer-reviewed. We have been 
reading through them multiple times. 
We are trying to get other comments.

They talk about, hey, there may be a 
cure for type 1 diabetes. There may be 
a cure, still has a long way to go, but 
there actually appears to be some in- 
lab breakthroughs on type 2 diabetes. 
Wouldn’t you and I, the left, the 
right, stop some of the monkey busi-
ness around here and say if we know 31 
percent of Medicare cost—and we know 
Medicare is the primary driver of U.S. 
sovereign debt. It is time for an Oper-
ation Warp Speed for diabetes. You 
don’t have to call it ‘‘Operation Warp 
Speed’’ because I know that triggers 
some folks on the left, but the fact of 
the matter is a concentration of bring-
ing disruption to cure people to end 
misery because we have to stop this 
thought process here of saying the way 
we are going to end people’s misery is 
we are going to build more clinics so 
you have more access to a doctor. 
My argument is to have the revolu-
tion because the revolution is here. 
Just think, a couple of years ago, we 
were dealing with the cost of liver 
transplants for hepatitis C, and then 
we came up with a cure. We can do 
this. 
Now you start to understand there 
are clinical trials out there for some 
new types of stem cell therapy. I read 
this paper multiple times because it 
was complicated and fascinating. Stem 
cell therapy, they worked through the 
rejection problem, and it appears—at 
least the early paper—to be a cure for 
type 1. There is a derivative paper that 
is out there actually from a Taiwanese 
university talking about their success 
in type 2. 
It is a different thought process. One 
of the greatest things we can do for 
U.S. sovereign debt and not collapsing 
this society and destroying my 6-year- 
old daughter’s economic future, as well 
as anyone that is heading toward re-
tirement, is actually how we invest our 
money today in things that end peo-
ple’s misery, and by ending that mis-
ery, all of society as well as those indi-
viduals’ benefit. 
The amusing part is I have been on 
this floor for several years talking 
about messenger RNA. Back when we 
used to call it CAR–T and you heard 
the stories about taking someone who 
functionally their immune system, the 
cancer they had, doing functionally 
what we now know as mRNA. Well, it 
looks like the breakthroughs and the 
fact that we have now turned much of 
what are diseases into software prob-
lems, and this is hard for a lot of folks 
to think through, particularly in the 
time where we have those who are very 
virus and vaccine conscious, but there 
is incredible hope here. 
As you all know, right now going 
into the field is functionally a vaccine 
for malaria. Now, it is only about 30 
percent, is the data, effective, but when 
teamed up with some other pharma-
ceutical, it is like 70 percent. It will 
change misery around the world. 
Well, it turns out, that same mes-
senger RNA goes far beyond COVID. We 
actually now are starting to under-
stand malaria, a whole bunch of can-
cers. Do you know one of the published 
papers from early this summer looks 
like they think they actually have a 
cure for HIV? Influenza, heart disease, 
it is fascinating. But helping the body, 
actually its immune system, work and 
rehab the heart. There are some amaz-
ing things. You saw the papers earlier 
this year about cystic fibrosis and 
thinking we are almost there for a 
cure. 
Remember, 5 percent is 50 percent of 
our healthcare spending. Maybe it is 
time to rethink about the world and 
the fact that we are going to invest in 
the disruption that is cures that end 
the misery instead of financing a coun-
try where we might actually lower 
drug costs, but the disruptions, the 
cures that could come in the future 
don’t show up. 
We can show you, in lots of studies, 
there are multiples out there when we 
are looking at the Democrats’ H.R. 3 
that by the end of the decade you actu-
ally saw the curve actually go up in 
healthcare costs because the cures 
didn’t show up. 
The other thing, and this is not a 
particularly great slide, and it is get-
ting a little old, but we have a whole 
binder in the office of articles talking 
about algorithms and, in this case, AI 
being able now to detect cancers very 
early, and the fact of doing that with 
this type of technology and technology 
that you can have at home. You can 
actually almost have it wearable. You 
can have it in your own medicine cabi-
net. Using those types of technologies 
is also part of our path to crash the 
price of healthcare. 
Remember, we are not going to 
change the United States getting older 
fast, the graying of America. But 
where we can bend the curve, bend mis-
ery and also bend the threat of the in-
credible amount of debt we are build-
ing up every single day, it is saying we 
are 
all 
in. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
do 
wearables. We are going to legalize 
technology. We are going to actually 
invest. 
The fact of the matter is it is hap-
pening right now where we are actually 
seeing countries around the world real-
izing how big of a problem diabetes is. 
Now there are awards going out saying, 
wow, we actually now have lines of re-
search that look like we can finally 
disrupt the disease. 
So, this was sort of the follow-up on 
last week where we did the whole slide 
chart of what is actually happening in 
U.S. sovereign debt and how much 
trouble we are really in and how fast it 
is building. 
You have to do a whole series of 
things. You have to grow the economy 
consistently. You have to manage tax 
policy. You have to manage regulatory 
policy in a way that is for maximizing 
economic expansion. You actually have 
to deal with immigration in a way that 
maximizes economic growth. Opening 
up your border, importing massive 
amounts 
of—let’s 
be 
brutal 
about 
this—poverty where that poverty and 
inflation are crushing the working poor 
in this country. The working poor will 
be substantially poorer at the end of 
this decade because of these policies. 
That is cruel. 
How about if we had growth? Because 
growth is moral. So you do these 
things of tax policy, regulatory policy, 
immigration policy, and then the fi-
nancing and tax incentives and the en-
couragement to do things that disrupt 
because you could actually do it in 
both healthcare; you can do it in en-
ergy; you can do it in transportation 
where we can make the future actually 
pretty darn amazing and actually end a 
lot of suffering and turns out it is the 
path that actually bends that debt 
curve that wipes us out as a society if 
we don’t actually start to tell the truth 
and deal with it. 
There is a path. There is optimism. 
Every day this place squanders work-
ing on the real problems and instead of 
the insanity of some of the policies 
that are being proposed today that the 
economists on both sides say will make 
the country poorer by the end of the 
decade, we are going the wrong direc-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I hope at least 
someone out there hears the message 
that there is a path. It is just getting 
harder and harder to get there because 
every day we fall further in debt. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Rights Act of 1965. I have done this for 
years. 
Today, Senators of both parties have 
the chance to show they are willing to 
do the job we were elected to do—to de-
bate and vote on legislation. And no 
legislation could be more foundational 
to our democracy than that which pro-
tects the right to vote. 
We 100 Senators all have the right to 
vote. Let us exercise that right and not 
avoid voting on the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. This is such a fundamental 
part of our democracy. Let’s set the ex-
ample here, where all 100 Senators 
know we have the right to vote. Let’s 
make sure we vote and not avoid vot-
ing. I hope that we as a Senate will 
honor 
the 
rich 
bipartisan 
history 
around the Voting Rights Act in the 
name of our hero John Lewis, in the 
name of our democracy, and in the 
name of a foundational value that is 
the bedrock of our country. 
Just yesterday, we announced a bi-
partisan compromise in the hopes of 
building support for the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. I am 
grateful to Senators MURKOWSKI and 
DURBIN and MANCHIN for their dedica-
tion to reaching this compromise. That 
bill, which we would seek to advance 
after proceeding to S. 4, will fully re-
store the Voting Rights Act, which is 
needed after two devastating decisions 
by the Supreme Court. 
I have been clear that should the 
Senate eventually proceed to this bill, 
then I would welcome amendments to 
further strengthen and solidify this 
restoration of the Voting Rights Act, 
which, after all, has been bipartisan 
since the first enactment, usually pass-
ing the Senate unanimously, being 
signed into law by Presidents Reagan 
and Bush and others. But we should at 
least have that debate. Certainly, Sen-
ators should not avoid debating, and 
certainly Senators should not hide be-
hind some procedural role so they don’t 
have to vote one way or the other on 
the basic rights of Americans to vote. 
So that is why we are here—to de-
bate, vote on bills. There is simply no 
reason for any Senator to look at their 
constituents and say that this topic, 
that of protecting the right to vote, is 
just too political or too controversial— 
not the Voting Rights Act; not a voting 
rights bill that has a 56-year history of 
bipartisanship. No Senator should act 
as though they are afraid to vote one 
way or the other on this. Is that the 
message we want to convey to Amer-
ican voters eager to know what the 
Senate 
is 
doing 
to 
protect 
and 
strengthen our democracy? Ours is the

November 3, 2021 
longest surviving democracy in his-
tory. The American people are watch-
ing and the world is watching what we 
do. Americans expect us to vote yes or 
no, not hide behind procedure. 
Restoring and updating the Voting 
Rights Act on a bipartisan basis is how 
we have always done it. The core provi-
sions of the Voting Rights Act have 
been reauthorized five times. Every 
time, there has been overwhelming bi-
partisan 
support, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike. 
Presidents 
Nixon, 
Reagan, 
and 
George W. Bush all signed Voting 
Rights Act reauthorizations into law. 
They touted the profound importance 
of this landmark law for our democ-
racy. In fact, I remember—I was here— 
the most recent Voting Rights Act re-
authorization in 2006 and the vote: 98 to 
0. We still have Senators serving today, 
both Republicans and Democrats, who 
voted to support that legislation. The 
compromise bill I crafted with Senator 
MURKOWSKI follows the very same blue-
print of these other bipartisan efforts 
to restore the Voting Rights Act. 
I am aware of the toxic partisanship 
of American politics today, but I hope 
that is not going to obscure what has 
for decades united us as Americans and 
across party lines, and that is the be-
lief that every one of us should have 
that protecting our right to vote—the 
very right that gives our democracy its 
name—is bigger than party or politics. 
It is the belief that a system of self- 
government—a government of, by, and 
for the people—is one that is worth 
preserving for generations to come. It 
is the belief that government exists to 
serve the will of the people, not the 
other way around. 
So I hope that today we are going to 
rise above partisanship. Let’s do what 
is right for our democracy. Let’s not be 
afraid to vote. I hope we show Ameri-
cans the Senate is still capable of being 
the conscience of the Nation and a uni-
fying force during a divided time. I 
still believe we can be the Senate that 
acts together to maintain Americans’— 
our constituents’—constitutional right 
to vote. 
When Senators come to the floor to 
cast their votes today, I hope they 
keep in mind the rich bipartisan his-
tory of the Voting Rights Act. I hope 
they decide to live up to that history. 
I hope they are also mindful of how his-
tory will remember us. Decades from 
now, when history tells the story of to-
day’s current threats to democracy, let 
it also tell the story of Senators who 
rose above the fray to protect the right 
that gives democracy its very name. 
Let all Senators vote so that all Amer-
icans can vote. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, Democrats continued making 
great progress toward finalizing Presi-
dent Biden’s Build Back Better plan. 
The challenges American families 
and workers are facing today are enor-
mous, and President Biden’s agenda is 
the remedy to much of their hardships. 
It is just what the American people 
want and what they need, and it is ex-
actly why we need to focus on getting 
the job done to finalize and pass this 
legislation and deliver help for the 
American people. 
Last night, I held another round of 
talks going past midnight with a num-
ber of my colleagues as we approach 
final agreement—talks with the White 
House, the Speaker, my Senate col-
leagues and chairs, and Members of the 
House. We continue to make very good 
progress each day. Passing such trans-
formative legislation is not easy, but 
the long hours we are putting into it 
will be well worth it for the American 
people. 
Over the last 24 hours, the hard work 
has yielded important new develop-
ment. Yesterday, I announced the 
Democrats had reached an agreement 
to include provisions in Build Back 
Better that will lower prescription 
drug prices for seniors and for Amer-
ican families. This is a big deal. 
For years, skyrocketing costs of pre-
scription drugs have plagued millions 
of seniors and American families to the 
point that Americans spend far more 
on prescription drugs per capita than 
other wealthy nations. It is one of the 
largest out-of-pocket medical expenses 
that families have and it has gotten 
worse over the last few years. 
For too many Americans, all it takes 
is a sudden serious illness and you can 
find yourself spending hundreds, if not 
thousands, and several thousands of 
dollars per year just to afford things 
like insulin or vitally needed cancer 
treatments. It is profoundly unfair and 
wholly un-American. 
Imagine the strain you can face if 
someone—you or a loved one—is ill and 
you can’t afford the medicine. You see 
them, their condition getting worse 
and worse. I can’t think of things that 
are worse than that, though I guess 
there may be a few. 
Yesterday, we took a large step for-
ward in helping alleviate that problem. 
For the first time ever, Medicare will 
be empowered to directly negotiate 
prices in Part B and Part D. This will 
directly 
reduce 
out-of-pocket 
drug 
spending for millions of patients every 
time they visit a pharmacy or a doctor. 
Our agreement does other things as 
well. It will cap out-of-pocket spending 
at $2,000 per year, ending the dilemma 
I just spoke about, where a life-chang-
ing diagnosis could mean thousands 
upon thousands of dollars in new ex-
penses that an individual can’t afford. 
This agreement will lower insulin 
prices so that Americans with diabetes 
don’t pay more than $35 per month for 
their insulin. Let me repeat that be-
cause it is amazing how the cost of in-
sulin used to be so reasonable, then 
skyrocketed over the last few years 
with very little reasonable, justifiable 
explanation. This agreement will lower 
insulin prices so that Americans with 
diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per 
month for their insulin. 
And it will reform the pharma-
ceutical industry to stop price gouging 
and make sure our country’s drug pric-
ing system benefits patients, not cor-
porations. 
It is not everything all of us wanted, 
but it is a major, major step in the 
right direction as we work to help the 
American people afford their better 
prescription drugs. We are going to 
keep working to make it even better, 
but this is a really good start and a 
major, major announcement. 
I want to thank all my colleagues 
who had a hand in putting this agree-
ment together: Senator WYDEN, Sen-
ator 
KLOBUCHAR, 
Senator 
MURPHY, 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO, Senator BEN-
NET, and Senator KELLY. I also want to 
sincerely thank Senator SINEMA
for 
working with us to reach this agree-
ment. 
We are going to build on this success 
as we continue making progress on the 
rest of Build Back Better. We are close. 
We are determined. We are confident 
that we will succeed in rewarding the 
trust that the American people have 
placed in us. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Now on voting rights. Shortly before 
his death, the great John Lewis offered 
the American people a parting mes-
sage: When you see something that is 
not right, you must say something. 
You must do something. Democracy is 
not a state. It is an act, and each gen-
eration must do its part to help build 
what we call the Beloved Community. 
The words of the great late John 
Lewis. 
Well, today, the Senate is being 
called to take action because, across 
our beloved democracy, something in-
deed is not right. Something malicious 
is afoot. A lie—a terrible lie—spread by 
the former President of the United 
States is eating away corrosively at 
the foundation of our democracy, of 
our democratic heritage, like a disease. 
This lie has led to the greatest co-
ordinated effort at the State level to 
suppress voting rights since the era of 
segregation. In States like Georgia and 
Texas, Iowa and Florida and Arizona 
and many others, partisans have re-
written the rules of our elections in 
broad daylight, potentially making it 
harder for tens of millions of young, 
minority, low-income, disabled, and 
generally Democratic-leaning voters 
from participating in elections. 
Today, the Senate will have a chance 
to respond to these attacks by voting 
to simply begin consideration—simply 
begin consideration—of the John Lewis

November 3, 2021 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. It is 
a commonsense proposal to reinstate 
the preclearance provisions of the Vot-
ing Rights Act which were wrongfully 
struck down by a conservative Su-
preme Court and which have a long his-
tory of bipartisan support in the Sen-
ate. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator LEAHY, who spoke earlier today, 
and Chairman DURBIN and all of my 
other Democratic colleagues who had a 
hand in drafting this proposal, and a 
special thanks to our colleague, the 
Senator from Alaska, who announced 
yesterday that she will vote in favor of 
opening debate on the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. I know it 
was not a decision she made lightly— 
she called me from Alaska and let me 
know—but my Democratic colleagues 
worked hard with her to compromise 
on a proposal that she could support 
while still maintaining the basic thrust 
of their legislation. 
Now, just as Democrats in the Senate 
worked with Senator MURKOWSKI
on 
legislation to strengthen our democ-
racy, we will work with other Repub-
licans in good faith to improve this leg-
islation, but they must come to the 
table first. I want to emphasize once 
again what today’s vote is about. We 
are not asking any Republican to sup-
port 
specific 
legislation. 
Today 
is 
about whether or not we will vote to 
begin debate here in this Chamber. 
Again, the preclearance provisions 
that are being updated in today’s bill 
have long been supported by both sides 
of the aisle repeatedly. The Voting 
Rights Act, which originally instituted 
them, has been updated five times in 
the last half century, under both Re-
publican and Democratic Presidents, 
and with votes from both sides. This 
has always been a bipartisan issue in 
the past; it should be no different 
today. 
I commit to my Republican col-
leagues that we will have a full-fledged 
debate process here on the floor, where 
our 
colleagues 
can 
offer 
germane 
amendments and voice what concerns 
they may have. 
Now, I hope more Members on the 
other side of the aisle will follow Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI’s example. Senate Re-
publicans shouldn’t be afraid of merely 
starting debate on an issue we have 
long debated and long supported in the 
past. 
Merely 
crossing 
arms 
and 
squelching 
any 
opportunity 
for 
progress is unacceptable. If Repub-
licans have different ideas on how to 
achieve a stronger democracy, they 
owe it to the American people to come 
forward and debate their ideas. I hope 
they do the right thing and vote for 
cloture to move forward on this discus-
sion later today. 
NOMINATION OF DILAWAR SYED 
Mr. President, finally, Mr. Syed. For 
every executive branch nominee who 
grabs headlines, there are many, many 
more who escape the spotlight while 
still playing an essential role in our 
government. 
Almost 
always, 
these 
nominees proceed through this Cham-
ber with bipartisan support, but, today, 
a handful of extreme Republican Sen-
ators are needlessly and callously 
stonewalling many of President Biden’s 
uncontroversial nominees. The case of 
Dilawar Syed—nominated to be second 
in charge at the SBA—stands out as 
being particularly, particularly egre-
gious. 
He is an American success story. He 
came to this country from Pakistan 
decades ago and became a successful 
entrepreneur, small business owner, 
and coalition builder. His nomination 
is backed by more than 200 civic, gov-
ernment, higher education, and busi-
ness groups and leaders, including the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce—hardly a 
mouthpiece for the Biden administra-
tion. Upon his confirmation, Mr. Syed 
would be the highest ranking Muslim 
in government, the highest ranking 
Muslim for Senate confirmation. 
But, for reasons that confound com-
mon sense, a handful of Republicans on 
the Small Business and Entrepreneur-
ship Committee are not just blocking 
Mr. Syed’s vote; they are refusing to 
meet in order to allow his nomination 
to proceed. They are just not even 
meeting, and that holds his nomination 
up. I haven’t heard of that happening 
in a very long time. 
To date, what is so confounding is 
that these Republicans who are holding 
Mr. Syed up have failed to offer a clear 
reason why they oppose him. Each 
time they try to come up with an ex-
planation, whether it is cheap ad 
hominem attacks or partisan tie-ins to 
the culture wars, their arguments fall 
flat and are easily refuted. 
Why are these handful of Republicans 
opposing this nomination? 
Although 
Republicans 
have 
boy-
cotted his markup several times, they 
will have a chance to give this man his 
vote tomorrow. Chairman CARDIN has 
worked with Republicans to try to get 
them to show up to tomorrow’s mark-
up. I commend Chairman CARDIN’s ef-
fort. 
Today, I ask: Will any Republicans 
have the decency to show up tomorrow 
to his markup and give Mr. Syed a 
vote? 
If they want to oppose him, they are 
free to go on record and explain why, 
but boycotting his markup, resorting 
to cheap and offensive attacks, and 
needlessly blocking a qualified public 
servant is a shameful, shameful course 
to take. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING JEAN ROUNDS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, we learned of the tragic passing 
of a much loved member of the Senate 
family. 
Jean Rounds was an impressive and 
active public servant who served the 
people of South Dakota in many ways, 
including as their first lady; who 
served a large and tight-knit family as 
mother and grandmother; and who, for 
our colleague, Senator MIKE ROUNDS, 
was, quite simply, the center of his 
world. 
The life MIKE and Jean built together 
was a partnership founded on faith, 
service, and love. By all accounts, 
Jean’s bravery, MIKE’s devotion, and 
the loving care of their family in the 
face of a terrible illness made their in-
spiring example shine even brighter. 
So the Senate is united in our grief. 
We will continue to hold our friend 
MIKE
and the entire Rounds family 
close in our thoughts and prayers in 
the difficult days that lie ahead. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. President, on a totally different 
matter, last night was a difficult 
evening for Democrats. The Demo-
cratic Party has wildly misread their 
mandate and let the radical left run 
the 
country. 
Local 
Democrats 
let 
teachers unions keep schools shut 
months longer than necessary and told 
parents they didn’t get a say in what 
their kids were learning. Washington 
Democrats have supercharged infla-
tion, recreated welfare without work 
requirements, and made America sig-
nificantly less energy independent. 
President Biden was only given a 50– 
50 Senate and a tiny majority in the 
House, but he decided to let the radical 
left run the country. Citizens wanted a 
return to normalcy but have gotten a 
never-ending series of government-cre-
ated crises. 
So, look, the American people will 
not stand for this. That is what voters 
told Democrats last night all across 
the country. The results from different 
parts of our country demonstrate that 
this was, in large part, a referendum on 
national issues. But it is not too late. 
Democrats should listen to the voters, 
drop this reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree, and stop trying to ram through a 
socialist 
transformation 
that 
the 
American people never asked for. 
The 
radical 
transformation 
that 
Democrats are writing behind closed 
doors would compound every mistake 
their party has made. Look at vir-
tually any part of American families’ 
lives, and Democrats’ reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree would seize control 
of it and yank it way to the left. 
The same Democrats who don’t want 
parents involved in schools want to 
take over daycare and pre-K, crowd out 
faith-based and family providers, and 
put this vast new system under the 
control of the culture warrior HHS 
Secretary, who sued the Little Sisters 
of the Poor. 
The same Democrats who pretend to 
defend working families are dead set on 
a massive tax cut that would over-
whelmingly benefit rich people in blue 
States. One of the biggest pieces of

their signature bill is now a huge tax 
cut for rich people. 
The same Democrats who say they 
support science and medicine want to 
slap arbitrary price controls on Ameri-
cans’ prescription drugs, reducing fu-
ture innovation and, according to ex-
perts, literally costing Americans their 
lives who would have lived if not for 
this policy. 
The same Democrats who pretend 
they care about Social Security and 
Medicare want to stretch seniors’ ex-
isting Medicare Program even thinner. 
Even though the trust fund is already 
just a few years away from running 
dry, they would do this in order to fund 
new giveaways. 
The same Democrats who talk a big 
game about competing with China 
want to raise taxes so high that our 
own American industries would face a 
higher tax rate than businesses have to 
pay in communist China. 
The same Democrats who are still 
trying to sneak forms of amnesty into 
this bill also want to make illegal im-
migrants eligible for new welfare. 
The same Democrats who pretend 
they are forward-thinking on energy 
issues want to hammer the U.S. econ-
omy with painful regulations while big-
ger emitters, like China, just keep on 
emitting—maximum pain for American 
families and no measurable gain for 
emissions or the climate. 
The bill our colleagues are writing 
behind closed doors is terrible from top 
to bottom—more debt, more taxes, 
more inflation, and fewer options for 
American families. 
This 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree would hurt families and help 
China. This radical social takeover is 
the last thing Americans need and the 
last thing Americans want. The voters 
of America just yesterday gave our col-
leagues a preview of that fact last 
night. It is not too late. They could 
still pull back from the brink while 
they can. 
VOTING LAWS 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, practically every single week, Sen-
ate Democrats make another attempt 
at grabbing new power over America’s 
elections. 
Remember, a giant partisan power 
grab over voting procedures in every 
county and State was Democrats’ cere-
monial first priority of this whole Con-
gress. They revealed their mission from 
the very start. That first proposal 
would have sent Federal funds to polit-
ical campaigns; overridden common-
sense State rules, like voter ID; and 
even changed the Federal Election 
Commission itself from a neutral ref-
eree into a partisan body. 
It was so bad—so bad—that even the 
New York Times called it a flawed bill 
that was ‘‘designed to fail.’’ That is, of 
course, exactly what happened here in 
the Senate, but the Democrats tipped 
their hand right from the start. They 
gave away the entire game. 
So 
every 
time 
that 
Washington 
Democrats make a few changes around 
the margins and come back for more 
bites at the same apple, we know ex-
actly what they are trying to do. 
Many of the go-nowhere bills that 
the Democratic leader has used for po-
litical theater had Congress essentially 
appointing itself—itself—the Board of 
Elections on steroids for every county 
and State in America. Congress was 
going to micromanage elections to a 
degree with no precedent. 
This new version, today’s episode in 
this ongoing series, is only slightly dif-
ferent. 
Rather 
than 
congressional 
Democrats trying to grab all the power 
for themselves, they are instead trying 
to pull off the power grab on behalf of 
the Democratic Attorney General. In-
stead of Washington Democrats and 
the legislative branch seizing power 
over elections in the country, it will be 
Washington Democrats and the execu-
tive branch doing the same thing—a 
slightly different twist on the same 
concept, but for the same partisan rea-
sons, with the same basic problems. 
In order to let Attorney General Gar-
land dictate voting procedures, Demo-
crats want to overturn Supreme Court 
precedent. Our colleagues’ flimsy argu-
ments keep losing in court, so they are 
now trying to overturn the courts. 
When States cracked down on the ab-
surd practice of ballot harvesting, 
Democrats ran to the courts, claiming 
discrimination, and lost. 
When liberals wanted to kill voter ID 
laws—which are popular with majori-
ties of Black Americans and Hispanic 
Americans, by the way—they ran to 
the courts. 
What happened? 
They lost. 
When the Supreme Court ruled in 
2013 that one part—just one part—of 
the 40-year-old Voting Rights Act need-
ed updating, the radical left said the 
sky was falling and voter turnout 
would collapse. 
Well, of course, the opposite hap-
pened. Turnout in 2020 was the highest 
since 1900. In one recent poll—listen to 
this—94 percent of voters say voting is 
easy. Ninety-four percent of voters say 
voting is easy, and, of course, it is. 
Moreover, the Voting Rights Act is 
still in effect. The courts haven’t 
struck down that law. It is simply false 
to suggest otherwise. The Supreme 
Court simply ruled that there was no 
evidence—no evidence—supporting the 
continuation of 40-year-old practices 
that were designed in the mid-1960s to 
address the specific challenges back 
then. 
There is nothing—nothing—to sug-
gest a sprawling Federal takeover is 
necessary. Nationalizing our elections 
is just a multidecade Democratic Party 
goal in constant search of a justifica-
tion. Their rationales change con-
stantly, but the end goal never does. 
Americans don’t need Attorney Gen-
eral Garland ruling over their States’ 
and their counties’ elections any more 
than they need congressional Demo-
crats doing it themselves. So the Sen-
ate will reject this go-nowhere bill 
today, like we have rejected every 
other piece of fruit from the same poi-
sonous tree. 
This body has real business we should 
be tackling. The Defense authorization 
bill is months behind schedule. The 
majority has been derelict in allowing 
bipartisan progress on appropriations. 
These are things we need to be doing. 
Every designed-to-fail political show-
boat comes at the expense of the things 
that we ought to be working on.

REMEMBERING JEAN ROUNDS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me 
begin this morning by saying how 
sorry we are to hear the news about the 
loss of the former First Lady Jean 
Rounds of the State of South Dakota. 
MIKE and Jean have been friends of 
ours for many, many years. I was in-
volved in Senator ROUNDS’ first cam-
paign for office when he ran for State 
Senate back in 1990. I have known Jean 
since I worked in the administration of 
late Governor George Mickelson along 
with her at the Department of Trans-
portation, and I just can’t tell you 
what a loss it is for the State of South 
Dakota. 
She was an individual who carried 
herself with incredible grace, always 
kind, had a humility about her that I 
think people just found infectious. She 
was very down-to-earth. She never lost 
that. As a First Lady, she conducted 
herself in a way that represented a 
great model for the State of South Da-
kota, both in her character and her 
conduct. The style, the way in which 
she has served as First Lady, is some-
thing that I think made every South 
Dakotan proud. 
So, today, along with all South Da-
kotans, Kimberley and I mourn her 
loss. We lift up the Rounds family in 
our prayers, and I hope and pray that 
through this time they will feel God’s 
grace and comfort in new and profound 
ways. But just a tremendous loss, and I 
know for my colleague MIKE ROUNDS, 
who has been a great partner of mine— 
we have been involved in politics to-
gether now, in South Dakota, for over 
30 years—that he, too, is going to need 
our support and our prayers in the days 
ahead. 
This is a tough job under ordinary 
circumstances, but with the burden 
that he has been and will be carrying 
now into the future, it is going to be 
really important that we do everything 
we can to support him and stand with 
him, and today especially with him and 
his family. 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. President, there is a lot of inter-
pretation about what happened in 
these off-year elections last night. Ob-
viously, the results in two tradition-
ally Democrat-leaning States are caus-
ing people to speculate about what it 
all means. 
And I listened to some of the anal-
ysis, and there are lots of armchair 
quarterbacks who are doing the anal-
ysis about what these—what we all

November 3, 2021 
should interpret these results; and, cer-
tainly, depending on where you are, 
you probably, maybe, come to certain 
different interpretations. 
But some of what I heard this morn-
ing from a Democrat analyst was that 
this is evidence that the Democratic 
Party needs to double down on the big, 
reckless tax-and-spending bill because 
people who voted in Virginia and New 
Jersey last night didn’t know what was 
in it, and when they find out all the 
good things that are in it, they are 
going to love this and they are going to 
want to support Democrats. 
And I have to say I think that com-
pletely misses the point. I think what 
people are saying is they don’t want to 
hand the keys to their lives to Wash-
ington, DC. This massive, reckless tax- 
and-spending spree that is being con-
templated here by Senate Democrats is 
historic in its sweep, its expansion, its 
growth of government, its cost, its 
pricetag, and it is historic in terms of 
the amount of taxation that will be put 
on the backs of the American people in 
order to pay for it. 
And I think what happened last night 
was a repudiation. It was repudiations 
of the nanny state and its belief that 
Washington knows best and that we 
should get people in this country more 
dependent upon Washington, DC. 
I think what the American people are 
saying is: We don’t want to be more de-
pendent on Washington, DC. We want 
Washington, DC, to let us live our lives 
and to focus on the things that are 
really important to us. 
And I think that the issues that were 
important yesterday had a lot to do 
with schools and kids and parents and 
whether or not they feel like they have 
control over their children’s futures 
and what they learn in schools. 
I think it had to do with the eco-
nomic future that people were looking 
out as they envision the future for 
them, 
for 
their 
kids 
and 
their 
grandkids, and they are looking at how 
stretched their incomes now are be-
cause of this growth and inflation. 
They are spending more on gasoline. 
They are spending more, as we head 
into the winter months, to heat their 
homes. They are spending more on 
food. They are spending more on hous-
ing. Literally everything in their world 
that they spend money on is going up, 
meaning their incomes are stretched 
thinner and thinner. 
So I believe that what people were 
saying last night is: We don’t want 
more Washington government and less 
freedom. We want less Washington gov-
ernment and more freedom. 
And I think that resounded across 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and 
across New Jersey. And I would suggest 
that the takeaway for Democrats here 
in Washington should be not we are 
going to double down, we are going to 
spend—we are going to ram through in 
a partisan way this massive tax-and- 
spending bill; but, rather, let’s pull 
back. Let’s see what is happening out 
there in the economy. Let’s see how it 
is affecting the average American 
worker and the average American fam-
ily and the average American small 
business, and perhaps head in a slightly 
different direction that doesn’t involve 
taking more taxes out of our economy 
and increasing inflation by flooding the 
zone with more government spending 
and, therefore, creating higher and 
higher inflation and ultimately mak-
ing things more expensive for the 
American people to where they look at 
their personal financial situation and 
realize how much just the cost of infla-
tion is impacting their family budgets 
on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, on 
a monthly basis. 
That, to me, should be the takeaway 
coming out of this because I certainly 
don’t believe in any respect that it 
wasn’t that the American people didn’t 
know what is in this massive tax-and- 
spending bill; rather, it is that they do 
know. They are finding out what is in 
it, and they are finding out that these 
are a lot of—there is a whole ton of 
spending in here. 
And, honestly, you have to be pretty 
darn creative to figure out how to 
spend $31⁄2 to $4 trillion, and there is a 
ton of taxing that goes with it. 
And there was a study that came out 
yesterday from Penn Wharton, which 
suggested that this massive and reck-
less tax-and-spending bill actually runs 
over a $2 trillion deficit over the 10- 
year period. 
If you look at the window, what it 
says is it is going to cost $3.9 trillion. 
This is based on the text that is cur-
rently available. And the taxes that 
are proposed to be raised generate 
about $1.5 trillion in revenue; there-
fore, a $2.4 trillion addition to the Fed-
eral debt, which is already, as we 
know, at the $30 trillion range and 
growing, literally, by the day. 
So I would simply suggest to my col-
leagues here on the other side of the 
aisle that the message coming out of 
these elections is not ‘‘We want more 
government for the American people. 
We want more dependence upon Wash-
ington, DC. We want Washington, DC, 
to do more things for us;’’ but, rather, 
‘‘We want Washington, DC, to get out 
of the way, quit trying to run our lives, 
and create the conditions that are fa-
vorable for economic growth and job 
creation and higher wages so that we 
can take care of our families, rather 
than having to depend upon Wash-
ington, DC, to do it.’’ 
I hope that this will be the resound-
ing message we need to defeat this 
massive 
tax-and-spending 
bill 
and 
allow the American people the freedom 
they need to lead their lives and to 
have better opportunities for them, for 
their kids, and for their grandkids— 
and better wages. 
Mr. President, I understand we have 
a vote coming up here, so I will yield 
the floor.

ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is 
the 1-year anniversary of an election 
that was judged the most secure in the 
history of America. Let me say that 
again. The election that ended Novem-
ber 3, 2020, 1 year ago, was judged the 
most secure in American history. That 
is not my opinion; that is the official 
conclusion, under the Trump adminis-
tration, of his Department of Home-
land Security, which coordinates with 
the Nation’s top cyber security and 
voting infrastructure experts to pro-
tect our elections. They released that 
assessment 10 days after last year’s 
election, and they did it in the face of 
a dangerous and unprecedented ava-
lanche of attacks and tweets from the 
enraged President Donald Trump, who 
claimed falsely that the election had 
been stolen from him. 
Those election security experts were 
not alone. President Trump and his 
loyalists filed more than 50 lawsuits in 
State and Federal courts, repeating 
their false claims of voter fraud and 
stolen votes—50. Every crackpot the-
ory that Rudy Giuliani could glean or 
spawn on the internet was tested in 
court. How did they do? Fifty lawsuits. 
No evidence to back their claims in the 
courts; only bizarre conspiracy theo-
ries 
and 
far-right 
internet 
gossip, 
which they accepted as gospel. Well, 
the lawsuits were all dismissed, some 
even by judges President Trump had 
nominated. It was not a great day for 
the theory of a stolen election in the 
courts of America. 
What happened next? What happened 
was documented by the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, which I chair. We 
brought witnesses before us to really 
explore stage 2 of President Trump’s ef-
fort to overturn the last election. 
When he couldn’t win in the courts, 
he decided to go to the Department of 
Justice. William Barr, his honored, 
loyal Attorney General, resigned after 
announcing 
he 
could 
find 
nothing 
wrong with the election, and then 
President Trump took it in his own 
hands. With a few of his allies, one of 
them Jeffrey Clark in the Department 
of Justice, they tried to pressure the 
Acting 
Attorney 
General, 
Jeffrey 
Rosen, to send a letter out to the attor-
neys general and other State authori-
ties across the Nation to tell them to 
suspend reporting the electoral college 
vote count. 
Well, Jeffrey Rosen and others stood 
up to the President even when he 
threatened to dismiss him and replace 
him. In fact, when that happened, a 
number of people in the Department of 
Justice, many of whom were ap-
pointees by President Trump, said that 
they would resign en mass if that hap-
pened. 
So the Trump approach to take this 
to the Department of Justice and to 
railroad his way through there failed, 
but the Big Lie continued. We all know 
about the death and destruction of the 
Big Lie in this Capitol Building, in this 
Senate Chamber, on January 6. In this 
Capitol Building, 5 people lost their 
lives, and over 100 law enforcement 
were attacked by the mob that de-
scended on this building. The entire 
world looked on in disbelief to think 
that a President would send a mob up 
to overrun the Capitol and to stop the 
electoral college vote count. 
The Big Lie is also corroding Amer-
ica’s faith in our electoral system. A 
new poll released this week disclosed 
that only one in three Republican vot-
ers trusts that the 2024 elections will 
be fair—only one in three. 
One year ago, Americans braved a le-
thal pandemic to cast their ballots. 
Many stood in line, some for hours. 
The 2020 general election saw the high-
est voter turnout in more than a cen-
tury, according to the Brennan Center. 
And as I said, it was our most secure 
election ever, as judged by President 
Trump’s Department of Homeland Se-
curity and his Attorney General, Wil-
liam Barr. We ought to be proud of 
that. 
Sadly, however, instead of telling 
people the truth and defending our 
elections, lawmakers in many States 
are using the Big Lie, propagated by 
former President Trump, as a pretext 
to undermine America’s right to vote. 
We need to use examples here so you 
understand what we are saying. 
Remember the runoff election for two 
senatorial seats in the State of Geor-
gia? It was an important election, and 
there were unprecedented numbers of 
voters participating in it. The law in 
Georgia at the time said that people 
could register to vote between the offi-
cial election count on November 3 and 
the runoff election count in January. 
Then the Georgia Legislature, after 
two Democratic Senators were elected, 
changed that and said: No, you can’t 
register to vote in that interim period 
of time. They reduced the amount of 
time that people would have to cast ab-
sentee ballots. 
Since the January 6 assault on the 
Capitol, more than 425 bills have been 
introduced in 49 States to make it 
harder to vote and in some cases easier 
for some politicians to overturn elec-
tions if they don’t like voters’ choices. 
This is exactly how democracies 
wither. If we undermine the most fun-
damental concept of democracy—the 
right to vote and the right for people in 
that electorate to choose its leaders— 
we are going to weaken this democracy 
that we were honored to inherit. 
Three times this year on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate, Republican Senators 
have used the filibuster, which histori-
cally has been the favorite tool of seg-
regationists—and I might add, many of 
those 
segregationists 
were 
Demo-
crats—to prevent this Senate from 
even debating voting rights. Let me 
say that again. Republicans have used 
the filibuster to prevent the Senate 
from even debating both the For the 
People Act twice and the Freedom to 
Vote Act. 
The other day, I looked up the clo-
ture vote on another of our Nation’s 
great laws, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
On June 10, 1964, Senators voted to end 
the longest filibuster in history and al-
lowed the Civil Rights Act to move for-
ward. The vote tally is important. 
Among Republican Senators, 27 voted 
for cloture to end the filibuster, and 6 
voted not to, to support the continu-
ation of the filibuster—27 to 6 on the 
Republican side. The vote by Demo-
cratic Senators, as history judges it, 
and I stand by that judgment, was less 
noble. Forty-four Democrats voted to 
end the filibuster on the Civil Rights 
Act, and 23 voted to sustain it. 
So if the Republicans voted with such 
a strong majority in favor of ending 
the filibuster that was propagated by 
Democratic 
Senators 
at 
the 
time 
against the Civil Rights Act, what has 
happened since? What has become of 
this Republican Party, this party of 
Abraham Lincoln? In fact, what has be-
come of the party of Ronald Reagan? 
You see, 40 years ago this week, 
President Reagan proudly signed a bill

November 3, 2021 
extending the full protections of the 
1965 Voting Rights Act for 25 years. 
This is what Ronald Reagan, Repub-
lican President of the United States, 
said: ‘‘For this nation to remain true 
to its principles, we cannot allow any 
American’s vote to be denied, diluted, 
or defiled. The right to vote,’’ he said, 
‘‘is the crown jewel of American lib-
erties, and we will not see its luster di-
minished.’’ 
What a statement—as powerful and 
decisive as one might ask from a Re-
publican President when he extended 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
So I want to commend my friend, and 
she is my friend, Senator LISA MUR-
KOWSKI, the senior Senator from Alas-
ka, for remaining true to the values of 
Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan 
even in this hyperpartisan age. 
Later today, the Senate will vote on 
whether to begin debate on the com-
promise version of the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. The com-
promise is the result of months of 
good-faith negotiation involving Sen-
ator LEAHY, the lead Democratic spon-
sor, my office, as well as Senator 
MANCHIN, Senator MURKOWSKI, and oth-
ers who support this legislation. It will 
restore the original intention and pro-
tections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, 
before misguided rulings by the Su-
preme Court gutted that magnificent 
law and rendered many of its critical 
protections vulnerable. 
When a narrow conservative majority 
in the Supreme Court struck down the 
Voting Rights Act enforcement provi-
sion 8 years ago, it concluded that Con-
gress could come up with a new en-
forcement formula for our times. Well, 
we did. This is it. The John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act con-
tains that new formula. It is fair, it is 
bipartisan, and we need it urgently to 
stop the nationwide assault on voting 
rights that is being justified by Presi-
dent Trump’s Big Lie. 
Years ago, in one of the most memo-
rable experiences in my public life, 
early on a foggy Sunday morning, I 
stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma, AL, with my friend John Lewis. 
The two of us looked across at that 
piece of territory just at the bottom of 
the bridge where John Lewis nearly 
died when he was beaten during that 
march. 
John Lewis risked his life so poor 
people and Black people in the Deep 
South could vote. 
John Lewis had more moral courage 
than anyone I have known. 
Many of our Republican friends say 
they revere him too. Well, today is the 
chance to show it. John Lewis cham-
pioned the Voting Rights Advancement 
Act in the months before he died. He 
knew it would protect the America he 
loved and the cause he nearly died for. 
The bill we will vote to begin debat-
ing later today is based on the same 
foundation as the Voting Rights Act 
extension 
that 
passed 
the 
Senate 
unanimously in 2006. Unanimously, it 
passed. But that was then, and this is 
now. 
Do you know who voted in 2006 for 
the protections that we seek to restore 
with the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act? 
Senator LISA MURKOWSKI was one of 
those who did. But also at that time in 
2006, the Senate Republican Leader, 
Senator MITCH MCCONNELL; the Senate 
Republican 
Whip, 
Senator 
JOHN 
THUNE—they voted for it too. It was a 
bipartisan, unanimous undertaking. 
Next week, Americans will pause to 
honor the courage and sacrifice of our 
veterans. Before we vote on whether to 
allow the Senate to even begin debat-
ing voting rights, I urge my Republican 
friends to remember the words spoken 
by another President, President John-
son. 
He spoke in the Capitol Rotunda, sur-
rounded by Republican and Democratic 
Senators of the day and the Reverend 
Martin Luther King and other heroes 
of the long struggle to secure voting 
rights. President Johnson called the 
passage of the Voting Rights Act ‘‘a 
triumph for freedom as huge as any 
victory that has ever been won on any 
battlefield.’’ 
For all those—the thousands—who 
have risked their lives to defend this 
country, they were defending not just a 
name, not just a piece of geography; 
they were defending our rights as 
Americans and they were prepared to 
die for it, whether on the foreign bat-
tlefield or on a bridge in Selma. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
let the Senate debate voting rights. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for cloture. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, later 
today, the Senate will vote on the lat-
est power grab by our friends across 
the aisle, a bill that is called the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
of 2021. 
The most important reason to vote 
against this legislation is that it is 
clearly unconstitutional. 
I know it is unusual for Members of 
the legislative branch to make state-
ments like that, but we do take an 
oath to uphold the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, and I think 
it is part of our responsibility to assess 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
legislation 
that is being proposed and to make a 
judgment on whether it is constitu-
tional or not. 
One reason why I say that is because 
the Supreme Court has made very clear 
that it is within the authority of the 
States to conduct elections, and that 
those elections must be run subject to 
the Voting Rights Act; but that is sec-
tion 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which 
applies across the entire country. 
One of the reasons we find ourselves 
in this position today is because, in 
2006, our Democratic colleagues pro-
posed an extension of the Voting 
Rights Act but did not update the for-
mula by which covered States were 
being determined. In other words, in 
2006, they did not reflect the huge im-
provement and advances made in mi-
nority voting strength since 1965. 
I think you could say without fear of 
contradiction that the Voting Rights 
Act is one of the most important and 
most successful pieces of legislation 
ever passed in this country. The good 
news is that it has worked exactly as 
Congress had hoped. So our colleagues 
are really trying to pass an unconstitu-
tional law, which would require States 
to change their voting rules to ask per-
mission of the Biden Justice Depart-
ment before they do so. 
As Chief Justice Roberts laid out in 
the Shelby County case, that is a de-
parture from the norm, to be sure, and 
can only be justified to remedy past 
discrimination. But if you look at the 
current numbers of minority voting 
strength around the country, you see 
minorities voting at historically high 
numbers and even in many instances 
exceeding that of the majority. So this 
is really a piece of legislation that is 
being sold under false pretenses. 
Based on the way our Democratic 
colleagues talk about the state of vot-
ing rights in America, you would think 
the Supreme Court had struck down 
the Voting Rights Act. The chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, who just 
spoke, the Democratic whip, described 
the current law as an ‘‘insidious effort 
to suppress the right of voters of 
color.’’ 
The majority leader, Senator SCHU-
MER, recently said that the right to 
vote was ‘‘under attack in ways we 
have not seen in generations.’’ 
And the Speaker of the House has 
said ‘‘voting rights are under relentless 
attack.’’ 
But the facts do not align with this 
doom and gloom picture of America. In 
2020, roughly two-thirds of all eligible 
voters cast a ballot. In Texas, 66 per-
cent of registered voters cast a ballot, 
11.3 million voters. Compared to 2016, 
17 million more people voted in 2020. 
This includes a higher turnout in 
Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian- 
American communities. 
When Congress passed the Voting 
Rights Act back in 1965, the goal—the 
laudable goal, which we all share—was 
to eliminate discriminatory practices, 
and there is no question that it ulti-
mately has worked. 
In 2012, for the first time on record, 
the turnout among Black voters was 
higher than that of White voters—high-
er. And in 2012, Hispanic and Asian vot-
ers turned out at the highest rate on 
record. 
So, clearly, thankfully, we have come 
a long way since 1965. And despite what 
Democrats would have you believe, the 
Voting Rights Act is alive and well and 
continues to protect minority Ameri-
cans from discrimination. 
Even though the facts don’t align 
with the Democrats’ sky-is-falling de-
piction of voting rights in America, 
that hasn’t stopped them from pushing 
this false narrative of widespread voter 
suppression. As our colleagues have 
demonstrated over the past few years,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7694 
November 3, 2021 
they have one tried-and-true strategy: 
if you can’t win the game, change the 
rules. 
They failed to stop conservative 
nominees from reaching the Supreme 
Court, so their solution is to pack the 
Supreme Court with additional Jus-
tices—just add more liberal Justices. 
They are uninterested in bipartisan-
ship, so they proposed ending the legis-
lative filibuster. We have heard that 
time and time again. The Democratic 
whip just talked about the filibuster. 
And since they failed to secure a man-
date in Congress, they want to forever 
change the rules of America’s elections 
to rig the game in their favor. 
We have seen a steady stream of bills 
designed by our Democratic colleagues 
to achieve this end. This current bill, I 
think, is about the third iteration. 
First came the so-called For the People 
Act. 
Who could be against the For the 
People Act? 
It was so unpopular among Demo-
crats that they had to go back to the 
drawing board and rewrite it. When the 
updated version came to the floor for a 
Senate vote, it went down with bipar-
tisan opposition. So they came back 
from their drawing board once again, 
giving their legislation a new and dif-
ferent name: the Freedom to Vote Act. 
They stripped out some of the most 
egregious provisions, but not nearly 
enough to change the fate of this par-
tisan bill; and like its predecessor, it 
failed to pass the Senate. 
But now our Democratic colleagues, 
they really do have the answer: a bill 
that perverts the cause of voting rights 
to give the Democratic Party unprece-
dented control over America’s elec-
tions. 
At the heart of this legislation is the 
preclearance regime. In other words, 
the States would have to ask the Fed-
eral Government: Can we pass laws in 
our State? 
And it would be up to the Biden Jus-
tice Department and Merrick Garland 
to say yes or no. 
Now, back in 1965, the original Vot-
ing Rights Act did have a preclearance 
requirement, but it is clear that, ac-
cording to the Supreme Court, that 
was only justified based on a history of 
past discrimination, which has now 
been essentially eradicated, if you be-
lieve the numbers of minority voters 
who are casting their ballots now. 
So think about the children’s game, 
‘‘Mother, may I?’’ All the kids line up 
on one side of the room except one who 
stands on the other side and acts like 
the mother. Before anyone can move 
forward, they have to ask, ‘‘Mother, 
may I?’’ Sometimes the mother says 
‘‘yes, you may,’’ and sometimes she 
says ‘‘no, you may not.’’ Sometimes 
she even orders the children to take a 
step backward. 
That is eventually what Democrats 
are proposing in this legislation, to 
make the Biden Justice Department 
the mother, and the States have to 
ask, ‘‘Mother, may I?’’ before they 
could even fulfill their constitutional 
responsibilities. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court struck 
down the portion of the law that set 
the formula for when a State or local 
jurisdiction 
would 
have 
to 
seek 
preclearance. But, to be clear—and you 
can’t tell this from the rhetoric on the 
left—the Court did not strike down the 
Voting Rights Act in its entirety; just 
the formula that determined which 
States would be covered. Because, as 
the Supreme Court said, that formula 
had to reflect current conditions, and, 
instead, Congress chose not to update 
the formula from 1965. That was sec-
tion 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States held unconstitutional. 
Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, 
speaking of the formula in that legisla-
tion, said: ‘‘ . . . history did not end in 
1965.’’ 
Well, here’s an example. The formula 
set in 1965 required States to receive 
preclearance if they had any ‘‘test or 
device’’ that restricts voting. That 
would include things like literacy tests 
or subjective determinations of good 
moral character, which are, thank-
fully, nowhere to be found today. 
Democrats have tried to market this 
bill as a response to the Supreme 
Court’s decision, but the truth is this 
legislation goes far beyond updating 
that outdated formula. 
It would make the formula so broad 
that virtually every State would have 
to ask of the Biden Justice Depart-
ment, ‘‘Mother, may I?’’ before making 
any changes in their election laws. So 
if a county or municipal utility district 
or the State itself wanted to do some-
thing as simple as clean up voter rolls 
and remove the names of dead people, 
they would have to ask the Federal 
Government and the Biden Justice De-
partment for permission to do so. 
Well, this is the same organization— 
the Biden Justice Department—that 
recently took aggressive actions to dis-
courage parents from exercising their 
constitutional right to speak out at 
local school board meetings. 
Clearly, we don’t need to vest States’ 
authorities in the hands of these unan-
swerable bureaucrats who are willing 
to abuse their power to discourage par-
ents from exercising their constitu-
tional rights. 
Based on this broad formula, you 
would think there has been countless 
unenforced instances of voter discrimi-
nation. If Democrats are willing to go 
this far to stop discrimination, it must 
be a widespread problem, right? 
Wrong. 
The Justice Department, as I said, 
retains the right to enforce section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act, which applies 
to the entire United States, and it pro-
hibits discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a lan-
guage minority group. 
During the entire 8 years of the 
Obama administration, the Justice De-
partment only filed four—four—en-
forcement cases under section 2. 
Well, if you think that discrimina-
tion against minority voters is ramp-
ant, don’t you think you would see 
more than four enforcement actions by 
the Obama administration over an 8- 
year period of time? 
Well, the power grab doesn’t stop 
there. 
This legislation also gives the De-
partment of Justice veto power over 
State voter ID laws. Now, we all know 
you have to show a photo ID to open up 
a bank account; buy tobacco, alcohol; 
get married; board a plane; and do 
countless other things in our country. 
But our Democratic colleagues have 
this thing about requiring voter ID to 
vote, to make sure that you are actu-
ally qualified and authorized to cast a 
ballot. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly support voter ID laws. Four in 
five people believe voters should be re-
quired to show a voter ID in order to 
cast a ballot. But this legislation 
would override the will of 80 percent of 
Americans and allow the Justice De-
partment to veto those laws for basi-
cally any reason that they choose. 
In so many ways, this legislation is a 
solution in search of a problem. It 
interferes—and I would say it usurps— 
the States’ constitutional authority to 
manage their own elections and set 
their own congressional districts. 
You would have to ask ‘‘Mother, may 
I?’’ of the Biden Justice Department to 
redo any redistricting, which is cur-
rently underway now, in advance. 
And it makes it virtually impossible 
for the States to take actions to pre-
vent fraud, essentially encouraging 
them to wait for large-scale voter fraud 
before they can take any action. And it 
arms the Department of Justice with 
new powers that will surely be used 
against those of the Democratic Party. 
We are still seeing the consequences 
of the Justice Department’s blatant at-
tack on concerned parents in our 
schools. Why on Earth would we hand a 
politically motivated Department even 
more power to abuse, especially when 
that power could shape the result of 
our elections? 
From 
city 
councils 
and 
school 
boards, all the way up to the President 
of the United States, the American 
people have a right—and I would argue 
a duty—to make their voices heard. A 
‘‘government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people’’—as Abraham Lin-
coln phrased it—is only possible if all 
Americans are free to participate in 
public life. 
Despite what the radical left might 
lead you to believe, there is no nation-
wide assault on minority voting rights. 
If there were, every single person in 
this building would be lined up to-
gether, arm’s length, to fight against 
it. 
As I said before, the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 is one of the most impor-
tant laws in modern American history, 
and it has actually worked, and it con-
tinues to protect all persons of color 
from any sort of discrimination when

it comes to their right to cast their 
ballot. 
This bill isn’t about supporting dis-
enfranchised voters, though, or fight-
ing voter suppression. This is a politi-
cally motivated power grab that would 
allow Democrats to determine and 
Washington to determine how elections 
in Texas would run. 
The narrative of widespread voter 
suppression is nothing but a scare tac-
tic designed to support a political out-
come. 
Republicans 
have 
blocked 
every 
iteration of this partisan power grab so 
far, and we will stand together to op-
pose this one as well at the next vote. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTION RESULTS 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, last 
night, the American people sent an un-
mistakable message to the Democratic 
Party: We don’t like your agenda, we 
don’t want your agenda, and we won’t 
vote for your agenda or for you. 
During this election, the Democratic 
Party was exposed for what it has be-
come: a party that holds police, par-
ents, and patriotism in contempt. And 
now the Democrats have paid the price. 
The Democrats will continue to pay 
that price until they reject the repug-
nant radicalism that has infected their 
party. 
The Democratic defeat last night was 
not in a single State or one county or 
some isolated municipality. It was not 
some isolated incident. It was not the 
result of just a single quirky issue or a 
bad candidate. It was a nationwide dis-
aster and wipeout for the Democratic 
Party. 
After 12 years of uninterrupted state-
wide victories in the Commonwealth of 
Virginia, Democrats appear to have 
lost not one, not two, but all three 
statewide races this year, along with 
control of the Virginia House of Dele-
gates. And the only reason they didn’t 
lose the Virginia State Senate is the 
State senate wasn’t on the ballot last 
night. 
I would remind you that Virginia is 
not a swing State, as you may have 
heard this morning to excuse the 
Democrats’ terrible performance. Joe 
Biden won Virginia by 10 points. It has 
been 12 years since Virginia voted for a 
Republican. Virginia is a Democratic 
State and has been for more than a 
decade. Yet, now, Joe Biden’s acolytes 
have been soundly defeated by Repub-
lican Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin, 
Lieutenant 
Governor-elect 
Winsome 
Sears, 
and 
Attorney 
General-elect 
Jason Miyares. It is remarkable how 
quickly 
the 
President’s 
party 
has 
frittered away all of the good will in 
Virginia. 
Now, I have also heard some Demo-
crats try to explain away the loss in 
Virginia by saying Terry McAuliffe was 
a bad candidate. Now, I certainly have 
no grief for Terry McAuliffe, but I 
would say that Terry McAuliffe was 
such a bad candidate that he also is 
causing the Democratic Governor in 
New Jersey to lose. Joe Biden won that 
State by 16 points, and at this moment, 
the Governor’s race is too close to 
call—too close to call. So it is at least 
a 16-point swing even if the Democratic 
Governor squeaks it out. 
Oh, by the way, the Democratic 
State senate president, one of the key 
power brokers in New Jersey, appears 
to be on his path to losing to a Repub-
lican truckdriver who spent a grand 
total of $153 on his campaign but some-
one who said: I am a dad and I am a 
grandfather, and I think that we are 
taxed too much and that we need bet-
ter representation. 
If anyone had told Governor Phil 
Murphy and the Democrats yesterday 
that this would be a close race, he 
would have been laughed out of the 
room. Yet outrage against Democratic 
policies is rampant even in deep blue 
New Jersey. 
Looking across State lines in New 
York, there was a similarly shocking 
outcome, with Republicans apparently 
sweeping every office in Long Island— 
every office in Long Island—driven in 
no small part by the insane, pro-crimi-
nal policies of the New York Demo-
crats who want to eliminate cash bail 
and defund the police and go soft on 
criminals and let them out of jail 
early. 
Speaking of that, let’s turn to deep, 
deep blue Minneapolis, MN, where the 
BLM riots got kicked off last summer, 
where Democratic ‘‘defund the police’’ 
radicals have waged an unrelenting war 
on their city’s police force. In a ref-
erendum to replace the police depart-
ment, 56 percent of voters revolted and 
voted to keep the police department 
just the way it is—thank you very 
much. 
This should teach the Democrats an 
important lesson. If ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ can’t win in a city that has been 
run entirely by Democratic mayors for 
nearly a half-century, it is not going to 
win anywhere. 
Now, if this was a bad night for 
Democrats, it was an even worse night 
for the woke, far-left progressives who 
dominate in the Democratic Party. In 
Buffalo, NY, voters appear to have re-
jected 
this 
Democratic 
radicalism. 
Self-proclaimed socialist mayoral can-
didate India Walton had actually beat-
en the incumbent Democratic mayor 
earlier this year for the nomination, 
but now India Walton is losing to the 
current mayor in a write-in cam-
paign—a write-in campaign. 
Again, if your far-left policies can’t 
even win when you are your party’s 
nominee and in a city that has been 
run entirely by Democrats for a half- 
century, you had better believe they 
are bad and unpopular policies that 
will cost you your next election. 
Finally, as far away as San Antonio, 
Republicans have flipped a largely His-
panic district long considered a Demo-
cratic bastion in a clear sign that Re-
publican inroads with Hispanic voters 
last year were not a fluke. 
So what is responsible for this as-
tounding red wave unlike anything we 
have seen in years? Well, if you listen 
to some in the media this morning, the 
answer is the same as always: It is Re-
publican racism. Glenn Youngkin is ap-
parently a smiling, fleece-jacket wear-
ing reincarnation of Democratic dema-
gogues. But if you look at the map and 
you look at the actual results, this 
laughable attack is exposed for what it 
is: dishonest propaganda. 
As part of this supposedly racist or 
White supremacist backlash election, 
more than half of Hispanic voters ap-
pear to have pulled the lever for Glenn 
Youngkin. Not one but two plurality- 
Black Virginia State House districts 
flipped to the GOP. Best of all for this 
supposedly racist or White supremacist 
backlash election, Virginia voters just 
elected the State’s first Black female 
Lieutenant Governor. That woman is 
Winsome Sears, a gun-toting immi-
grant, Marine veteran, and a proud 
conservative Republican. 
So much for the media spin. Now for 
the truth. According to exit polls, the 
top issues on voters’ minds were the 
economy and education. Both spelled 
disaster for the Democrats. 
For months, Americans have watched 
with alarm as Democrats have shoveled 
trillions of dollars into liberal prior-
ities while inflation has surged up-
wards. 
They 
have 
suffered 
sky-
rocketing costs at the grocery store 
and the gas pump. 
First, the Democrats said this is 
merely transitory inflation. Then they 
laughed it off as a joke, and they said: 
Sorry. You will have to lower your ex-
pectations. It may take you a while to 
get your treadmill. 
Then they demanded trillions of dol-
lars more in their so-called Build Back 
Better initiative, which should perhaps 
be called ‘‘build back broke’’ if you are 
a working family. 
So when Glenn Youngkin offered to 
eliminate Virginia’s onerous grocery 
tax and cut the progressive gas tax, 
normal Virginians listened, and they 
voted. 
American parents have also been ig-
nored and mistreated by the schools 
that are supposed to be teaching their 
kids. Remote learning was a disaster 
for America’s children. Some have fall-
en months behind in their develop-
ment, and many more have suffered the 
consequences of social isolation. But if 
there is a silver lining in this tragedy, 
it is that parents were finally able to 
see the nonsense that their kids were 
being taught: critical race theory, in-
doctrinated to see everything and ev-
eryone first and foremost by the color 
of their skin and to hate their country. 
Parents were outraged, and parents 
were right to be outraged. 
Now, the Democrats’ response to this 
controversy reminds me of the old line

that that dog didn’t bite you; he is not 
my dog; he kicked you first. Their first 
response was that critical race theory 
is a figment of your imagination. And 
they said it is not taught in Virginia. 
And they said: Well, it should be 
taught anyway because our schools and 
our institutions are so racist. 
Then again, they also said that there 
was no threat of having teenage boys 
in girls’ bathrooms. We now know that 
Loudoun County didn’t just cover up 
one rape—one rape—of a teenage girl 
by a boy dressed as a girl but then 
transferred that boy to another school, 
where he committed a second assault. 
Not surprisingly, parents in Loudoun 
County didn’t take too kindly to the 
woke Democrats in charge of that 
school system. 
When their arguments failed to per-
suade, the Democrats tried a different 
tactic: 
silencing 
parents. 
Terry 
McAuliffe boldly claimed that parents 
shouldn’t tell schools what they should 
teach their kids. Attorney General 
Merrick Garland even tried to sic the 
FBI on parents who showed up to pro-
test at school board meetings. 
So it is no wonder that parents voted 
for Republicans in Virginia and across 
the country when the alternative was 
nothing but contempt and spite for 
parents raising their children as they 
see fit. 
So, yes, the American people are dis-
appointed, dissatisfied, and, frankly, 
disgusted with the modern Democratic 
Party, which sneeringly claims that it 
knows best always and about every-
thing. Now, if it did, it would have seen 
this coming. 
I would simply caution my Demo-
cratic colleagues, especially four fu-
ture former one-term Senators, that if 
they don’t change their ways, if they 
proceed with this reckless tax-and- 
spending bill, which includes over a 
trillion dollars in wasteful spending 
and 
which 
is 
littered 
with 
woke 
projects and leftist schemes, next year 
will be even worse. That chill you feel 
is the voters walking over your grave. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

REMEMBERING ABNER LINWOOD HOLTON, JR., 
AND VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to offer a tribute to one of my 
best friends and my political hero, my 
father-in-law, Linwood Holton, who 
died last Thursday at age 98. 
I wanted to talk about Linwood and 
his influence on my life, but there is no 
more appropriate time to talk about 
him than right now, as we are about to 
cast a vote to proceed to the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
Abner Linwood Holton, Jr., was born 
September 21, 1923, in Big Stone Gap, 
VA. Big Stone Gap is a tiny town in 
the far southwest corner of Virginia, a 
few miles from the Virginia-Kentucky 
border. 
He was the son of a dad who helped 
run a small railroad—the Interstate 
Railroad—that would bring coal out of 
the coalfields to connect with a larger 
rail line that ran north and south 
through the Great Valley of Virginia. 
Growing up at that time, with three 
siblings, with parents who cared deeply 
about him, he saw the challenges of the 
Depression. And my father-in-law was 
a very remarkable youngster because 
he had a deep empathy for other people 
that sometimes young folks don’t al-
ways have. 
My father-in-law wrote an autobiog-
raphy called ‘‘Opportunity Time’’ in 
the early 2000s, and he described an ex-
perience in his life that was pivotal to 
the rest of his life. He was young, 8 or 
9 years old. He lived in a community 
that was predominantly White folks. 
There were few African Americans in 
his town. It was a community that was 
connected to coal mines in Appalachia. 
He saw a friend of his talking to an el-
derly African-American man in an in-
credibly mean and disrespectful way, 
and it shocked him. 
So he asked the man, after his friend 
had gone: Why did you let him talk to 
you that way? I can’t believe that a 
youngster would talk to an adult that 
way. 
And the man basically just pointed 
to the color of his skin and said: What 
choice do I have? That is just the way 
we get treated. 
When Linwood wrote his autobiog-
raphy—I can almost quote this directly 
from memory—he described that in-
stance, and he said: It caused me to 
feel such shame then, and I feel shame 
as I write these words today. 
Sometimes young people watch how 
others treat people, and they just ab-
sorb, OK, I guess that is the way you 
treat people. But Linwood, as a young-
ster, immediately could grasp, no, that 
is not the way to treat people. 
I think he connected the discrimina-
tion against this African-American 
man with a discrimination that he 
kind of felt being from Appalachia. 
There were stereotypes about Appa-
lachians—hillbillies or whatever else 
they might be called—and he resented 
that. He didn’t like anybody looking 
down on him, and he decided that the 
answer to that was not for him to look 
down on others, but that, instead, any-
body looking down on anybody else was 
doing wrong. I think this was also part-
ly out of Lin’s deep religious faith. He 
was raised in a Presbyterian church, in 
Big Stone GA, VA. 
My father-in-law went on to go to 
Washington and Lee. Pearl Harbor hap-
pened. His parents wrote him and said: 
We know what you are going to try to 
do. You are going to try to drop out of 
college to go fight World War II. Please 
don’t do it. 
He promised his parents he would get 
through the end of the academic year, 
and did. And then he dropped out, and 
he joined the Navy. 
I said to my father-in-law once: You 
were in Big Stone Gap. You had never 
even seen the ocean before. Why would 
you join the Navy and not the Army? 
He said: In the Navy, you always get 
a bunk, and I hate sleeping on the 
ground. 
So he joined the Navy. He was in the 
submarine corps in the Pacific during 
World War II. He participated in the 
occupation of postwar Japan. Then 
came back to Virginia, settled in Roa-
noke; met my mother-in-law, Jinx, who 
turned 96 10 days ago; had four chil-
dren, including my wife, Anne—Anne 
was the second of their four children— 
10 grandchildren. 
But after practicing law in Roanoke, 
he made a decision that he didn’t like 
politics in Virginia and he was going to 
try to do something really important, 
which was create a competitive two- 
party system. 
Virginia was dominated by a political 
machine called the Byrd Machine from 
the 1920s until the 1960s. So there 
wasn’t really two-party politics. And 
the Byrd Machine was a machine in a 
particular way—sometimes if we think 
about machines, we might think about 
corruption and bribery. That was not 
what the machine did. The Byrd Ma-
chine was corrupt in maybe even a 
more damaging way. It dramatically 
limited who could vote, who could par-
ticipate; drove down turnout in elec-
tions through mechanisms, like poll 
taxes and literacy tests and other 
things so that very few folks could 
even participate in the democracy in 
Virginia—the mother of Presidents. 
Linwood came back from the Pacific 
in World War II. There was a Gov-
ernor’s race in 1945, in Virginia, and a 
gentleman by the name of Bill Tuck, 
from Halifax County, won that race. 
And Linwood has told me this a million 
times: I came back and Bill Tuck won 
the Governor’s race, and the total 
turnout in the race was about 8 percent 
of Virginia adults—8 percent. 
Poll taxes kept people away. Lit-
eracy tests kept people away. The ab-
sence of a meaningful two-party sys-
tem made some folks say: Why bother? 
And Linwood said: I fought in the Pa-
cific for democracy, and I come home 
to the Commonwealth of Virginia and 
this is what I’m faced with. 
And so he took it upon himself to 
build a Republican Party so that there 
could be a competitive two-party de-
mocracy in Virginia that would give 
people a choice and that would break 
down barriers of all kinds to people 
being educated together, people work-
ing together, and people being able to 
vote and participate. 
My father-in-law is most known be-
cause he was the Governor that inte-
grated the public schools of Virginia 
after previous Governors had kept 
them segregated, even 16 years after 
Brown v. Board of Education. 
The Byrd Machine had insisted that 
Governors fight against the Federal

Government, fight against bussing, 
fight against the notion that children 
could sit in a classroom next to some-
body whose skin color was different. 
In Virginia, during my lifetime, a 
number of jurisdictions even shut their 
public schools down for years, years at 
a time—in one instance, for 5 years— 
rather than let students go to schools 
together where they might sit with 
somebody of a different race. Prince 
Edward County and other counties shut 
schools 
down—Warren 
County 
in 
Northern Virginia, Norfolk. 
Linwood wanted to break that up. 
That passion for racial equality from 
his early days led him to want to break 
that up because we are all equal, but 
also, education is so important; why 
deprive anyone of an educational op-
portunity? So he campaigned first 
twice for the House of Delegates in Ro-
anoke and lost both times. Then he was 
the Virginia candidate for Governor, 
the Republican candidate, in 1965. He 
got 35 percent of the vote, which was 
unheard of for a Republican. Then he 
ran again in 1969, and he won the gover-
norship on his fourth try for elected of-
fice. 
Shortly after his election, a Federal 
court 
in 
Richmond 
ordered 
that 
schools be bussed to achieve the ending 
of segregation and have students be 
able to learn together regardless of the 
color of their skin. 
Linwood did what was unthinkable in 
1970. Instead of fighting against bus-
sing and fighting against integration, 
he not only said ‘‘I am going to support 
this,’’ but he said ‘‘I am going to sup-
port it with my own school-age chil-
dren.’’ 
My wife and her siblings lived in the 
Governor’s mansion, and it wasn’t in 
any particular school district. They 
could have gone to all-White schools in 
the suburbs. They could have gone to 
private schools. But, instead, the Gov-
ernor and his wife, my mother-in-law, 
and the four kids decided, we are going 
to go to the neighborhood schools. And 
those neighborhood schools were pri-
marily African-American schools. 
Linwood escorted my sister-in-law, 
Tayloe, into John F. Kennedy High 
School, 
a 
predominantly 
African- 
American high school in Richmond, in 
the fall of 1970. The picture of the Gov-
ernor and Tayloe walking into that 
predominantly Black school was on the 
front page of the New York Times. 
There had been so many pictures of 
Governors in the South standing in 
schoolhouse doors blocking African- 
American kids from coming into high 
schools and colleges, but there was 
only one picture—only one—of a south-
ern Governor escorting his daughter 
into a primarily Black high school to 
send the message that we are all equal; 
that education is important and the 
era of defiance in fighting against the 
Supreme Court is over. 
Linwood also brought African Ameri-
cans into State employment in leader-
ship roles in very significant ways that 
had not been done before. 
As people think about Governor Hol-
ton, they think about him as a pioneer 
who helped turn Virginia away from 
defiance and segregation to try to real-
ize the original promise of equality 
that another Virginian, Thomas Jeffer-
son, articulated in the Declaration of 
Independence. He did other things as 
well. He created the modern cabinet 
system in Virginia. He unified the Port 
of Virginia. These ports in Newport 
News, Portsmouth, and Norfolk that 
were kind of competing with each 
other—he brought them all together so 
they could compete with ports around 
the world rather than with each other. 
He imposed an income tax to clean up 
Virginia’s rivers. 
But his true legacy and what people 
think about him is, he was a champion 
for racial equality at a time when lead-
ers were needed. And it was hard. It 
was hard. Linwood had spent now 20 
years building up a competitive two- 
party democracy in Virginia, and he 
left office with a 77-percent approval 
rating when he was about 47 years old. 
But his party would have nothing to do 
with him. They were so upset with this 
founder of the Virginia modern Repub-
lican Party; they were so upset with 
him for integrating public schools that 
when he ran for the U.S. Senate just a 
few years later, in 1978—he had been 
out of office 3 years—in a four-way Re-
publican-nominated convention, he fin-
ished third out of four because his pro- 
racial equality stand was so controver-
sial. As you might imagine, that made 
my father-in-law a little bitter. He had 
worked so hard to build up a two-party 
system and to champion racial equal-
ity that that was hard for him. 
I met my wife and started to date her 
shortly after he had unsuccessfully run 
for the Senate. I come from a com-
pletely nonpolitical family from Kan-
sas City. I knew nothing about politics, 
nothing about Virginia. Then I got to 
know this kind of scary, you know, po-
tential father-in-law who was notable 
and had been a Governor, and he 
seemed kind of intimidating to me. But 
as I got to know his story, I could see 
how proud he was of his accomplish-
ments and of his children but how pain-
ful it was to have advanced in steps of 
courage toward something good and 
then be frozen out, basically, of politics 
thereafter. 
Yet, through the miracle of lon-
gevity, people came around. They came 
around to appreciate him. Beginning in 
about the 1990s, people started to say: 
Linwood Holton—that was a good Gov-
ernor. He lived long enough to see his 
reputation be restored and people un-
derstanding his pivotal role in helping 
Virginia move forward. 
The obituaries and tribute to Gov-
ernor Holton when he passed last 
Thursday at noon, peacefully—and my 
wife was there to tell her mother that 
her husband of 68 years had just 
passed—the tributes that have come in 
have been remarkable, and the family 
kind of laughed about the things that 
they are saying about Lin Holton. They 
are 180 degrees different than the 
things they were saying about him in 
the 1970s. 
Pages, living well is the best revenge. 
Live according to your vows and stick 
by it. You know what. It will come 
back to you one day, and people will 
respect you for being a person of prin-
ciple. That is how it was with Lin. 
I am on the floor today—I was in-
tending to come today regardless of 
what the vote was because I wanted to 
kind of collect my thoughts about my 
father-in-law. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
things he stands for: the value of equal-
ity; that losing isn’t bad. He ran for of-
fice five times in his life, and he only 
won once. His record is 1 in 4. But no-
body ever says about Lin Holton that 
he lost four elections. What they said 
is that he was Governor at a tough 
time and that he had courage and a 
backbone, and he did what was right. 
He was also a great voting rights Gov-
ernor. 
Here is where I want to conclude and 
then lead into the vote that we will 
cast on the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act. 
Remember I told you how when 
Linwood came back from World War II, 
there was a Governor’s race, and the 
turnout was just so pitifully low be-
cause of things like poll taxes that 
were designed not only to disenfran-
chise African-American voters but poor 
White voters too. If you didn’t pay 
your poll tax, it would accumulate 
year to year, and then you would go to 
vote, and you would be presented with 
a big bill. If you couldn’t pay it, you 
couldn’t vote. That is what kept voting 
percentages so low in Virginia. 
Poll taxes were commonly used this 
way in the South, all over the South. 
Many States had abandoned poll taxes 
by the 1940s and 1950s because they dis-
enfranchised not only African-Ameri-
cans but also poor Whites. But Virginia 
still had a poll tax. That was one of the 
main reasons why turnout was so low 
in the election of 1945, and it became 
an object in the platform of the Repub-
lican Party that my father-in-law built 
to get rid of poll taxes. They tried and 
they tried, but they were outmatched 
in the Virginia Legislature, and the 
Byrd Machine wanted poll taxes. 
This body, Congress, got rid of poll 
taxes as a prerequisite to voting in 
Federal elections in the 24th Amend-
ment to the Constitution. It was passed 
and then ratified by the States in 1964, 
but poll taxes were still used in State 
elections in Virginia. 
Get this: When Lin ran for Governor 
in 1965 and lost, the total votes cast 
were about 565,000 votes. When he ran 
for Governor in 1969 and won—with the 
support of business and labor and the 
civil 
rights 
organization—now 
the 
total vote was 965,000. In one cycle be-
tween two Governor’s races, the turn-
out went up by 65 percent in one cycle, 
and it went up for one reason: In Har-
per v. Virginia in 1966, the U.S. Su-
preme Court struck down poll taxes for 
State elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7698 
November 3, 2021 
So when you cleared that obstacle 
out of the way, participation dramati-
cally improved. Even though a Repub-
lican won, my father-in-law, it was 
great for democracy—small ‘‘d’’ in de-
mocracy—because more participation 
is a positive thing. 
Last night, we had a Governor’s race 
in Virginia, and it didn’t end up the 
way I hoped that it would, but there 
was a good thing for democracy in that 
election. The turnout in last night’s 
election in Virginia was 25 percent 
higher than in the Governor’s race 4 
years earlier. That is a huge, huge in-
crease in voter participation. Why was 
the turnout so much higher? It was 
higher because our Virginia Legisla-
ture made a series of reforms to take 
Virginia from one of the hardest States 
to vote in in the country—couldn’t 
vote easily early; couldn’t vote in per-
son early; had to have an excuse to 
cast an absentee ballot. In 2019, our two 
Democratic houses passed legislation 
that now makes Virginia one of the 
easiest States to vote in in the coun-
try. As a result, the turnout went up 
by 25 percent from the last Governor’s 
race to the race last night. 
Again, it wasn’t the outcome that I 
wanted, but creating more opportuni-
ties for voting rights just wasn’t to 
help the Democratic Party; it was ac-
tually to help small ‘‘d’’ democracy in 
the same way my father-in-law battled 
against poll taxes. When they were 
knocked down, there were more people 
willing to participate. The reforms we 
made in Virginia have enabled both 
Democrats and Republicans and Inde-
pendents to participate more conven-
iently and thus have driven up voting 
turnout. 
I am a strong supporter of the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act, restoring 
meaningful preclearance, and requiring 
jurisdictions that have a pattern of 
voting 
rights 
violations 
to 
seek 
preclearance. One of the reason I so 
strongly support it is I lived under the 
Voting Rights Act as the mayor of 
Richmond, and I lived under it as a 
Governor of Virginia, and it wasn’t 
hard. When we were making changes, 
we would submit them to the Justice 
Department. They had 90 days to re-
view them. They would ask us ques-
tions. We would have dialogue. They 
would usually give us a green light. 
When they gave us a green light, we 
had some assurance that we were not 
doing anything intentionally—we were 
not doing anything that even unwit-
tingly gets in people’s way in terms of 
being able to vote. 
This 
bill 
would 
restore 
the 
preclearance requirement that the Su-
preme Court struck down in 2013 by re-
quiring preclearance not of jurisdic-
tions based on where they are—South-
ern States—but instead saying to any 
jurisdiction—North, South, East, West, 
Midwest—if you have had a pattern of 
voting rights violations in the past 25 
years, you must seek preclearance, but 
as soon as you are clean, with no vot-
ing rights violations for 10 years, you 
don’t have to seek preclearance unless 
you commit new voting rights viola-
tions. Even-steven. Every part of the 
country is treated the same. 
The initial Voting Rights Act was 
completely bipartisan. Its reauthoriza-
tion over years has been completely bi-
partisan. I stand on the floor to ask my 
colleagues, in the memory of my fa-
ther-in-law, a Republican who was my 
political hero, who was a pro-voting 
rights person, as the Republican Party 
has been during much of its life, I ask 
my colleagues to join together and sup-
port vigorous participation of voters in 
this democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I come to the floor this afternoon to 
speak also about the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. This 
is S. 4. 
Listening to my friend from Virginia 
here describe some of the history that 
he and his family have been through, 
again, this is an important part of the 
discussion and debate when we talk 
about one of the very cornerstones of 
our identity as an extraordinary na-
tion, this principle of democracy and 
freedom and fair and open elections. 
The majority leader filed cloture on 
the motion to proceed on Monday 
evening, and despite some very real 
reservations that I have—and it is fair 
to talk about those reservations—I will 
be among those who vote to begin de-
bate on this measure when we have 
this vote in a few minutes here. I will 
do so because I strongly support and I 
believe that Congress should enact a 
bipartisan reauthorization of the Vot-
ing Rights Act. We have done that. 
Congress has done that five times since 
1965, typically—typically—by an over-
whelming margin here in the Senate. 
It has been about 15 years now since 
our last amendment to the Voting 
Rights Act, and I think it is fair to say 
that 15 years after passage, it is prob-
ably timely and necessary to look at 
updates. 
In order to do that, I think that what 
we have to do is we have to step back 
from the partisanship. We have to step 
back from the politicization that is 
driving this conversation. I think we 
should be able to agree to meaningful 
improvements that will help ensure 
that all of our elections are free, they 
are fair, and they are accessible to all 
Americans. 
Now, those who follow this issue 
know that it is probably no great sur-
prise that I am involved in this discus-
sion here today. I have been the lead 
Republican cosponsor of the voting 
rights reauthorization now for the last 
6 years. I have worked with my friend 
from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, as well 
as 
with 
Senator 
DURBIN, 
Senator 
MANCHIN, and others to shape a frame-
work that will allow us to make some 
progress on some very real and legiti-
mate issues. 
At this point, I feel that we have got 
a good foundation to help provide ac-
cess to the ballot that is equal, again, 
for all Americans and free from any 
form of discrimination. We should all 
be able to support legislation to assure 
just that much—that much—because 
nothing, as my friend from Virginia 
has said, is more fundamental than the 
right to vote. 
We have all heard that story of Ben-
jamin Franklin being asked at the end 
of the Constitutional Convention about 
the type of government that the Fram-
ers had designed. His response, at least 
according to some sources, was, ‘‘A re-
public if you can keep it.’’ 
I recognize that one of the surest 
ways to lose our Republic is to allow 
the public trust in our elections to 
erode, and I fear that that is where we 
are—that that trust, that faith, in our 
own elections is eroding. 
I have engaged in voting rights legis-
lation because I want us to continue to 
reduce those barriers to Americans’ 
ability to voting, whether it is geo-
graphic, whether it is logistical—and 
we certainly know about that in Alas-
ka—whether it is partisan or some 
other form. I think we recognize that 
we have come a long way from the 
1960s—I would, certainly, hope so—but 
I think we need to acknowledge that 
we can continue to build on that 
through reasonable and well-considered 
legislation. 
The voting rights legislation that I 
support is not this sweeping overhaul 
that would take power away from the 
States in order to federalize the elec-
tion process. There was a bill earlier on 
the floor this year, and I voted against 
that. I didn’t like that very detailed, 
prescriptive approach that, I felt, was 
moving us toward a federalization. 
Instead, the legislation that I sup-
port 
would 
provide 
greater 
trans-
parency for Federal elections so that 
voters are fully informed, so that they 
know about the changes in voting pro-
cedures. It would protect voters from 
discrimination in all of its forms and 
continue to knock down the barriers 
that we know, in many places, still 
exist. 
It would provide protections for vot-
ers, for election workers, and polling 
places to discourage the efforts to 
interfere, to intimidate, or to phys-
ically harm them. 
It would provide for voting materials 
in relevant areas to be translated in 
our Native languages. This is very im-
portant for us back home in Alaska. 
It would require States that have his-
torically been found to discriminate 
against minority voters to, once again, 
preclear their changes in their voting 
laws, and it would uphold the many, 
many good practices and procedures 
that we have in States like Alaska, 
rather than burdening them with new 
mandates that aren’t designed for a 
place, again, like Alaska where, geo-
graphically, logistically, it just might 
simply not work. 
That is the kind of legislation that I 
can support, but I need to be clear 
here. That is not the description of S.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7699 
November 3, 2021 
4, the bill that is being brought up for 
debate. I don’t support S. 4 as it was 
written and as it was introduced. What 
I can support in its place and as a 
starting point is the substitute amend-
ment that the majority has agreed to 
lay down should the Senate agree to 
begin debate. That substitute amend-
ment contains more than a dozen sig-
nificant changes that my team and I 
have been working with others to nego-
tiate. 
So the question, I think, needs to be 
asked: Is that enough? And I say: No, it 
is 
not 
enough. 
Even 
with 
those 
changes, I still have concerns, and I 
know that many of my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle have concerns. 
Substantive changes will be needed be-
fore this measure is ready to pass the 
Senate. 
So, if this procedural vote fails 
today, where do I think we go next? We 
have to go back. We have to consider 
this legislation through regular order, 
through the committee process. 
In the meantime, I mentioned just 
the 
politicization, 
the 
partisanship 
that we have seen with these issues. I 
think: Let’s stop the show votes. Let’s 
give ourselves the space to work coop-
eratively across the aisle to reach the 
level of consensus that I think is im-
portant. It is important for this issue, 
and it is important for this country. 
The goal here should be to avoid a 
partisan bill, not to take failing votes 
over and over for political gain. It real-
ly doesn’t get us anywhere. It gets us 
on record. It allows you to weaponize, 
if you will, a critically important 
issue. 
It 
doesn’t 
go 
anywhere. 
It 
doesn’t serve anyone. It, ultimately, 
accomplishes nothing. Our only real 
option here is to figure out how we are 
working together on this. Our goal 
should be to match what we did in 2006 
when the last reauthorization of the 
Voting Rights Act passed the Senate 98 
to 0. 
Wouldn’t that be a goal for us all? 
Wouldn’t that send a signal to people 
across this country—from Alaska to 
Maine—to have faith in our electoral 
process, in our elections? 
Now, some may be wondering why, as 
a Republican, I am willing to put my 
name next to this legislation, pretty 
publicly, and acknowledge that it is 
not where I want the bill to be right 
now. But at this point, I think, if we 
can step back from the political exer-
cise, I think we can do good. I think we 
need to do good. I believe that those of 
us who want to find common ground 
need to be part of the process. We need 
to be willing to get in, mix it up, and 
work it out, instead of sitting back on 
the sidelines and saying: I just don’t 
like your product, and I am not going 
to offer anything else. I just don’t like 
your product. 
So let’s get in the arena. Given my 
role as vice chairman of the Indian Af-
fairs Committee, I believe that I have 
an obligation to help resolve some of 
the longstanding issues that face our 
Native peoples in Alaska and around 
the country. 
Finally, I believe it is simply dan-
gerous to let voting rights become a 
wholly partisan issue, where our divi-
sions just fester and take root in an 
area that is so central to our system of 
government. 
So the vote in front of us today is 
procedural in nature on whether to 
open debate. It is not on final passage 
or anything close to it. There are even 
things in the substitute text that I, 
frankly, don’t support and others that 
I have not been able to fully evaluate. 
But I also recognize that the frame-
work within the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act is the most 
viable that we have, and it is the best 
starting point at which to legislate. So 
I will vote to begin this debate in the 
hopes that this is a step forward, not a 
step backward, as we are seeking a bi-
partisan accord. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that Senators 
HOEVEN, MURRAY, MCCONNELL, and I be 
able to complete our remarks prior to 
the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
Senator HOEVEN and I are here to speak 
in favor of the Assistant Secretary of 
the Army for Civil Works, but I did 
want to first thank Senator MUR-
KOWSKI for her well-reasoned remarks 
and for her willingness to go forward 
with this debate. This is a debate about 
fundamental voting rights. We may not 
agree on everything, but she wants to 
have the debate, and that is all we are 
asking for. 
We are asking to move forward with 
this very important piece of legisla-
tion. If there are things people don’t 
like or things they like, we can discuss 
them, but this place has got to start 
working. We need to restore the Senate 
so we can debate the big issues of our 
time. 
I truly appreciate Senator MUR-
KOWSKI’s willingness to do this today 
with her vote. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL LEE CONNOR 
Madam President, I come to the floor 
briefly today to support Michael Con-
nor’s nomination to serve as Assistant 
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. 
Senator HOEVEN and I are here to-
gether because we both care very much 
about getting this position filled. All of 
us have major, major projects in our 
States that need to be built, and he 
needs to get in this job. We are hopeful 
that we will have a vote on this tomor-
row. 
Michael brings to this position un-
paralleled experience in water manage-
ment, and I am not just talking about 
his professional work but also his up-
bringing. He grew up on the edge of the 
desert in New Mexico, and he was 
raised with a heightened understanding 
of the importance of water practices. 
Over the course of his career, he has 
spent nearly two decades at the De-
partment of the Interior. During that 
time, he led efforts on water resource 
management. This experience will be 
vital as he takes on this new leadership 
role. 
We all know about the importance of 
the Army Corps of Engineers’ Civil 
Works Program, from supporting navi-
gation on our inland waterways and 
coastal ports to maintaining reservoirs 
that supply water to communities, to 
providing flood protection and risk 
management. 
Senator HOEVEN and I are here to-
gether because we care a lot about 
flood protection. The Red River doesn’t 
divide us between Minnesota and North 
Dakota; it unites us in our efforts to 
protect our communities. The Red 
River of the North has exceeded flood 
stage 55 times between 1902 and 2019, 
and the problem has worsened in recent 
years, with 7 of the top 10 floods occur-
ring during the last 30 years. As we 
begin to see more and more severe im-
pacts from extreme weather events, 
water management and resiliency will 
be increasingly important all over the 
country. 
To build up sustainable water infra-
structure that can manage flooding 
across all 50 States, we need leaders 
like Michael Connor overseeing the 
Army Corps. Time and again, he has 
proven himself to be a dedicated and 
capable leader. 
Michael Walsh, a retired Army major 
general and former Corps of Engineers 
Deputy Commanding General for Civil 
and Emergency Operations, said in an 
interview that Michael Connor ‘‘has 
deep experience with water resource 
issues. He’ll bring that experience to 
the Army.’’ 
I am proud to be supporting him. 
Again, we are very hopeful that we can 
have this vote tomorrow. 
I want to thank Senator HOEVEN for 
the work that he has done in making 
sure we can clear the way for this vote 
on his side of the aisle. 
Senator HOEVEN. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
thank the senior Senator from Min-
nesota for her hard work in getting Mi-
chael Connor to the floor. I have been 
very pleased to join with her, and, ob-
viously, we are hopeful that, tomorrow, 
we will have that vote. 
The position of the Assistant Sec-
retary of the Army for Civil Works is 
critical to every Member of this body. 
Every State has interactions with the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the 
Assistant Secretary is the top civilian 
who oversees the Corps of Engineers. 
The Assistant Secretary plays a vital 
role in formulating the Corps’ budget, 
in setting policy and priorities for the 
Corps, and in ensuring that an incred-
ible array of projects is managed and 
executed across the Nation. 
For example, in my State of North 
Dakota, we have Corps projects in com-
munities like Minot on flood protec-
tion. A number of years ago, we had 
11,000 people and 4,000 homes and build-
ings inundated. Obviously, flood pro-
tection is incredibly vital for them,

November 3, 2021 
and we need the Corps working to get 
that done. 
In the Red River Valley of the North, 
as Senator KLOBUCHAR said so accu-
rately, we are working together for 
comprehensive flood protection in that 
region. 
It 
is 
a 
multibillion-dollar, 
multi-State project that uses the latest 
approach of a public-private partner-
ship with a WIFIA loan guarantee. We 
are doing things in a way that hasn’t 
been done before that can really help 
us cut into the backlog that the Corps 
has on these flood projects. 
But it takes a lot of work and a lot 
of creativity to keep that moving for-
ward, and so we need the Assistant 
Secretary in place to help us do that, 
and that is why we need to move for-
ward with this confirmation vote. 
And as Senator KLOBUCHAR said cor-
rectly, Mr. Connor is well qualified for 
this position. He held the No. 2 position 
at Interior from 2014 to 2017. He also 
served as Commissioner of the Inte-
rior’s Bureau of Reclamation from 2009 
to 2014. He worked on Capitol Hill from 
2001 to 2009 as counsel to the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
So he has got the background to do 
this. He is ready to go. Let’s have this 
vote on confirmation and let’s put him 
to work for the great people of this 
great country. 
And with that, I would defer again to 
the Senator from Minnesota for any 
concluding 
remarks 
she 
has, 
but, 
again, I want to thank her for working 
on this in a bipartisan way. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. With that, I will 
turn it over to Senator MURRAY. 
Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
Senator 
HOEVEN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF RAJESH D. NAYAK 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
first of all, I come to the floor to call 
for the confirmation of Rajesh Nayak 
to serve as Assistant Secretary of 
Labor for Policy. 
Over the past year and a half, our 
working families across the country 
have really struggled through the most 
unequal economic crisis in recent his-
tory. 
COVID put a glaring spotlight on 
many of the problems workers were al-
ready facing before this pandemic and 
has worsened longstanding inequities, 
making life harder for women, workers 
of color and workers with disabilities, 
and others. 
If we are going to build back stronger 
and fairer from this pandemic, then our 
Federal Agencies must be fully staffed 
with highly qualified people who will 
help us tackle the many challenges 
hurting workers, retirees, and their 
families. 
Mr. Nayak already has an impressive 
track record of doing just that. Mr. 
Nayak served as a senior adviser to 
Secretary Walsh at the Department, 
and also previously served in the So-
licitor’s office as Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary for Policy and Deputy Chief of 
Staff. In those roles, he has worked on 
a broad portfolio of issues important to 
workers across the country, including 
workforce development, worker protec-
tion, 
counter-trafficking, 
overtime 
pay, health and safety, retirement se-
curity, and more. 
He has also worked twice at the Na-
tional Employment Law Project, in-
cluding most recently as deputy CEO. 
As an advocate and a policymaker, he 
has shown time and again his commit-
ment to empowering workers, sup-
porting families, and advancing equity. 
And I have no doubt that, if confirmed 
as Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Policy, he will continue working in the 
best interests of workers and their 
families, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting in support 
of his nomination. 
JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Madam President, I also rise today 
before this really crucial vote because 
I want to make it clear that Democrats 
are not done on the issue of voting 
rights. 
First of all, I want to thank my col-
league, Senator MURKOWSKI, from Alas-
ka, whose remarks we should all listen 
to because we do have some who are re-
peatedly preventing us from even de-
bating voting rights legislation; most 
recently the Freedom to Vote Act. 
I want everybody to know we are not 
done fighting to ensure that every per-
son in this country has equal and fair 
access to the ballot. We are not done 
because the cause we are fighting for 
here today is a just one and Americans 
want to see us protect their right to 
vote, and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act does exactly 
that. 
This bill will restore and strengthen 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which is 
one of the most important bills in our 
Nation’s history. It was a bipartisan re-
jection of racist attempts by States to 
deny the ballot to people of color, and 
it came after years of dedicated work 
by activists and lawmakers, including 
the 
late, 
honorable 
Congressman 
Lewis, who were and are intent on en-
suring our country followed through on 
our Nation’s most fundamental prom-
ise to its citizens: the promise that 
every United States citizen has an 
equal voice in our elections. 
For most of the decades following its 
passage, the provisions in the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act have enjoyed bipartisan 
support. But in recent years, the power 
and protections of this crucial law have 
been gutted, and far-right legislators in 
States across our country are now 
passing laws that make it harder for 
communities of color to vote, all based 
on baseless claims about voter fraud 
and rigged elections. 
It is shameful and it really is anti- 
democratic, and it should be bigger 
than partisan politics. We should be 
able to come together on a bipartisan 
basis to pass a Federal prohibition on 
laws that restrict the right to vote 
based on race. Protecting each citizen’s 
right to have a voice in our democracy 
should be as noncontroversial as nam-
ing post offices, because the right to 
vote is the cornerstone of our democ-
racy, and attempts to weaken it weak-
en the foundation that we all depend 
on. 
Those are the stakes here: the foun-
dation and future of our democracy. 
Without equal access to the ballot, 
how will people tell us what they want 
to see on most challenging questions of 
our time, like climate or healthcare or 
education or so much more? 
So even if many of my Republican 
colleagues disagree with me about the 
provisions included in this bill, they 
should at least allow us to move for-
ward on a debate. If they have good- 
faith ideas how to protect every Ameri-
can’s voice in our democracy, we are 
all ears. But we will need more than 
one or two Republicans in order to be 
able to have that debate on the floor 
and offer amendments. 
And if we can’t get there, I think we 
need to be clear. As Congressman 
Lewis said: ‘‘Nothing can stop the 
power of a committed and determined 
people to make a difference in our soci-
ety.’’ 
To the people of my home State of 
Washington and to the country: My 
Democratic colleagues and I are com-
mitted and determined to pass strong 
voting rights legislation. 
And we can’t keep bringing these 
bills to the floor only for Republicans 
to block even a debate. We need to use 
every legislative tool needed to get the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act to President Biden’s desk. 
Whatever we have got to do to pass 
voting rights, if it means an exemption 
to the filibuster, then I believe we 
should do it. This cannot wait. 
Passing strong Federal voting rights 
protections into law will be the most 
important work this Congress does. We 
cannot let a Senate procedure stop us 
from protecting the right to vote in the 
United States of America. 
Let’s make sure our democracy stays 
a democracy, and let’s pass the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
whatever it takes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. This has become 
an almost weekly routine—my friends 
on the other side trying to give Wash-
ington unprecedented power over how 
Americans cast their vote. 
We don’t have time to do the NDAA 
or an appropriations process, but we al-
ways have time for a few more of these 
stunts. In many of these bills, congres-
sional Democrats propose to make 
themselves into a national board of 
elections. 
Today, there is a small difference. 
They want, instead, to hand that power 
to Attorney General Merrick Garland; 
different branch of government, same 
bad idea. 
I just want to add one observation 
from last night. Governors’ races and 
State legislative seats weren’t the only

things on the ballot last night. Yester-
day, the deep blue State of New York— 
New York, the home of the Senate ma-
jority leader—had two of America’s 
signature proposals for weaker elec-
tions actually on the ballot as ballot 
measures. Citizens got to vote directly 
on whether to open the door to two 
changes that the politicians wanted: 
same-day registration and no-excuse 
absentee voting, on the ballot in New 
York yesterday. 
And as of the latest tally a few min-
utes ago, both proposals were losing. 
They currently are both losing about 
60/40. Even in deep blue New York, citi-
zens appear to be rejecting the Demo-
crats’ demands for weaker elections. 
So I think there is only one question 
left: Where will the Mets and Yankees 
end up now? 
Surely Major League Baseball can’t 
let them stay in New York after this. 
I urge a no vote. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

jection, it is so ordered.

The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to 
rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
standing rules of the Senate, do hereby move 
to bring to a close debate on the motion to 
proceed to Calendar No. 143, S. 4, a bill to 
amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to re-
vise the criteria for determining which 
States and political subdivisions are subject 
to section 4 of the Act, and for other pur-
poses.

The VICE PRESIDENT. By unani-
mous consent, the mandatory quorum 
call has been waived. 
The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the motion to 
proceed to S. 4, a bill to amend the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the 
criteria for determining which States 
and political subdivisions are subject

Mr. SCHUMER. I vote no. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 50, the nays are 49. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the failed

MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee 
on the Judiciary being tied on the 
question of reporting, I move to dis-
charge the Committee on the Judiciary 
from further consideration of Jennifer 
Sung, of Oregon, to be United States 
Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the 
provisions of S. Res. 27, there will now 
be up to 4 hours of debate on the mo-
tion, equally divided between the two 
leaders, or their designees, with no mo-
tions, points of order, or amendments 
in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
for the information of the Senate, we 
expect to vote to discharge the nomi-
nation to occur following the votes 
that are scheduled to begin at 5:15 to-
night. Therefore, Senators should ex-
pect three rollcall votes at 5:15 p.m. 
These votes will be on the confirmation 
of the Prieto and Nayak nominations 
and on the motion to discharge the 
Sung nomination. 
JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Madam President, in reference to 
what just occurred on the floor in 
terms of voting rights, this is a low, 
low point in the history of this body. A 
few moments ago, Senate Republicans, 
for the fourth time this year, were pre-
sented with a simple question: Will 
they vote in favor of starting debate— 
merely a debate—on protecting voting 
rights in this country? 
In today’s case, they would join 
Democrats in proceeding to the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
which would reinstate longstanding 
and widely embraced Federal protec-
tions on the right to vote. 
With just one exception, Republicans 
once again obstructed the Senate from 
beginning its process. Given the chance 
to debate in what is supposed to be the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, Re-
publicans walked away. 
Today’s obstruction was only the lat-
est in a series of disturbing turns for 
the Republican Party. For over a half a 
century, the policies of the Voting 
Rights Act have commanded bipartisan 
support in this Chamber. It has been 
reauthorized five times, including by 
Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush. 
Many of my Republican colleagues in 
office today have worked in the past to 
improve and approve preclearance pro-
visions similar to the ones contained in 
today’s proposal. 
It was good enough for Republicans 
back then; it should have been good 
enough for them today. But after to-
day’s vote, it is clear that the modern 
Republican Party has turned its back 
on protecting voting rights. The party 
of Lincoln is becoming the party of the 
Big Lie. 
Democrats have laid out the facts for 
months: we are witnessing at the State 
level the greatest assault on voting 
rights since the era of segregation. Be-
fore our very eyes, the heirs of Jim 
Crow are weakening the foundations of 
our democracy. 
And by blocking debate today, Sen-
ate Republicans are implicitly endors-
ing these partisan actions to suppress 
the vote and unravel our democracy. 
We have said all year long that if 
there is anything worth the Senate’s 
attention, it is protecting our democ-
racy. We have tried for months to get 
Republicans to agree. We have lobbied 
Republicans privately. We have gone 
through regular order. We have at-
tempted to debate them on the floor. 
We have presented reasonable, com-
monsense proposals in June, August, 
October, and now in November. Each

November 3, 2021 
time, I personally promised my Repub-
lican colleagues they would have ample 
opportunities to voice their concerns, 
offer germane amendments, and make 
changes to our proposal. 
At no point did we ever ask them to 
vote for our legislation. We have sim-
ply been trying to get our Republican 
friends to start debating, just as the 
Senate was intended to do. 
On the floor, off the floor, we held 
public hearings, group discussions with 
Senators and one-on-one meetings with 
the other side to try and win some sup-
port. 
Senators 
MANCHIN, 
KAINE, 
TESTER, 
KING, 
DURBIN, 
KLOBUCHAR, 
LEAHY, and more have all met with Re-
publicans to initiate a dialogue. And at 
every turn, we have been met with re-
sistance. 
The sole exception in 10 months has 
been our colleague, the Senator from 
Alaska, who voted in favor of advanc-
ing today’s legislation. Today, I thank 
her for working with us in good faith 
on this bill. 
But where is the rest of the party of 
Lincoln? Down to the last Member, the 
rest of the Republican conference has 
refused to engage, refused to debate, 
and even refused to acknowledge that 
our country faces a serious threat to 
democracy. 
Madam President, the Senate is bet-
ter than this. A simple look at our his-
tory shows we are better than this. The 
same institution that passed civil 
rights legislation, the New Deal, the 
Great Society, and the bills of Recon-
struction should be more than capable 
of defending voting rights in the mod-
ern era. 
But, as anyone who has been here 
more than a few years knows, the gears 
of the Senate have ossified over the 
years. The filibuster is used far more 
today than ever before—by some meas-
ures, 10 times as much compared to 
decades past. Some might wonder if 
any of the great accomplishments of 
the past would have a chance of pas-
sage today. Would the Social Security 
Act pass the modern Senate? What 
about the Medicare and Medicaid acts? 
What about the Civil Rights Act of 
1964? We sure hope they would, but it is 
difficult to see with the way this 
Chamber works today. 
As I said a few weeks ago, I believe 
the Senate needs to be restored to its 
rightful status as the world’s greatest 
deliberative body. It has earned that 
title precisely because, yes, debate is 
the central feature of this body, but at 
the end of the day, so is governing, and 
so is taking action when needed once 
the debate has run its due course. 
This is an old, old fight in this Cham-
ber. Over 100 years ago, the great Sen-
ator of Massachusetts, Henry Cabot 
Lodge, said: ‘‘To vote without debating 
is perilous, but to debate and never 
vote is imbecile.’’ Imbecile. ‘‘To vote 
without debating is perilous, but to de-
bate and never vote is imbecile.’’ We 
should heed those words today and ex-
plore whatever path we have to restore 
the Senate so it does what its Framers 
intended: 
debate, 
deliberate, 
com-
promise, and vote. 
We can’t be satisfied in this Chamber 
with thinking that democracy will al-
ways win out in the end if we aren’t 
willing to put in the work to defend it. 
It will require constant vigilance to 
keep democracy alive in the 21st cen-
tury. 
Madam President, just because Re-
publicans will not join us doesn’t mean 
Democrats will stop fighting. This is 
too important. We will continue to 
fight for voting rights and find an al-
ternative path forward, even if it 
means going at it alone, to defend the 
most fundamental liberty we have as 
citizens. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from Wy-
oming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, I am 
joining my colleagues today to high-
light the real harm that the Presi-
dent’s overreaching vaccine mandates 
are causing the people of Wyoming and 
the United States. 
While I am vaccinated and support 
others making the decision to get the 
COVID–19 vaccine to protect them-
selves, I am very concerned about un-
acceptable actions by the executive 
branch to force Americans to get the 
vaccine. Frankly, I cannot stay silent 
about these blatant violations of per-
sonal freedom. 
Over the last several months, the 
President has signed numerous Execu-
tive orders mandating vaccines for 
Federal workers, contractors, and em-
ployers with over 100 workers. This is 
unacceptable. These mandates are far- 
reaching and burdensome. 
Additionally, these mandates will 
not achieve the desired results of stop-
ping the spread of COVID–19. Instead, 
they will only further politicalize 
healthcare choices, sow greater discord 
across the Nation, and exacerbate our 
employment crisis. I worry they will 
also further harm our supply chain 
issues. All of these should concern 
every American, particularly with the 
holiday season rapidly approaching. 
Consumers are going to face empty 
shelves in stores, and for what is avail-
able, prices will continue to rise. 
In the freight industry, these man-
dates could mean that up to one-third 
of employees will be leaving their jobs. 
On Monday, POLITICO noted that sev-
eral trucking companies are looking to 
end their work with the Federal Gov-
ernment as the vaccine mandate dead-
lines loom closer. This doesn’t only im-
pact the shipping industry but also our 
defense and law enforcement sectors as 
well. Former Deputy Under Secretary 
for 
Industrial 
Policy 
William 
Greenwalt noted that ‘‘even a couple of 
welders or engineers who walk off their 
jobs on a highly classified program 
could wreak havoc with our national 
security.’’ 
Meanwhile, it is more than a couple 
of individuals who are looking at leav-
ing. Defense contractor Raytheon says 
they expect to lose thousands of em-
ployees when the mandate goes into ef-
fect. 
Finally, I would like to give an exam-
ple of how this is impacting my home 
State of Wyoming. Across the Nation, 
we are facing nursing shortages, but in 
Wyoming, it is becoming critical. I 
have heard over and over again from 
my hospitals, clinics, and nursing 
homes that they just don’t have the 
staff. Many have left the field, whether 
due to the strain of COVID–19 or be-
cause they believe they can find better 
work as traveling nurses. This has left 
our 
healthcare 
community 
shortstaffed. 
If we lose additional nurses from 
these vaccine mandates, my State is 
looking at losing healthcare capabili-
ties. This means turning away patients 
and potentially closing nursing homes. 
These patients, at the end of their 
lives, frequently have nowhere else to 
go. If there is no one else to care for 
them, the healthcare system will be at 
the end of its rope trying to find ways 
to care for these patients. 
For these reasons, I cannot support 
these mandates, nor should anyone 
else. Knowing the damage these man-
dates will cause, the President must 
immediately rescind these Executive 
orders and find a better way to keep 
our Nation safe. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. We are here today be-
cause of the vaccine mandate. When I 
got back home over the break, I never 
had so many friends and fellow busi-
ness owners who actually made it a 
point to find me and tell me that this 
can’t be happening. 
With the full navigation that we have 
taken through COVID, I have always 
been clear: Take it seriously. We don’t 
know how this is going to end up. 
It has been over a year and a half. 
The point back in Indiana is that most 
businesses, schools, all organizations 
have put protocols in place to where it 
has not been an issue. It has been a 
nonissue of, really, transmissions with-
in the workplace. 
We finally get through it, we found 
the rhythm of what works, and now 
you have a mandate that says: Hey, 
Federal employees, Federal contrac-
tors—they contacted me too. Some 
think they will lose 10 to 25 percent of 
their workforce. Businesses are in the 
same place. 
When you look at what we have done, 
where we are, it just does not make 
sense. That is why I am leading the 
Congressional Review Act effort to try 
to get all Senators on my side—some 
on the other side of the aisle—to say: 
Hey, we don’t need it. Enough is 
enough. 
Look at the practical reasons be-
cause businesses and other organiza-
tions have tried and they have been 
successful at keeping their employees 
and their customers safe and healthy. 
This is coming at a point in time where 
it is going to be salt in the wound. It

will be the biggest wallop these enti-
ties have had, especially when we have 
been paying them to keep their em-
ployees, up to 500 employees. Now we 
are going to force them to lose them en 
masse down to 100. It doesn’t make 
sense. That is why I am glad I am lead-
ing the effort and glad other Senators 
are here talking about it. 
Please pull back on something that is 
beyond the pale, that we don’t need, 
and that is going to hurt the places we 
have been trying to help. 
I yield to the Senator from Florida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, in December, President Biden 
promised he would not require Ameri-
cans to be vaccinated or require that 
they carry vaccine passports. Less than 
10 months into his Presidency, I think 
he must have forgotten what he said, 
breaking promise after promise and 
going back on his word. How can the 
American people believe anything he 
says? 
Americans are sick and tired of the 
government telling them what to do 
and are more than capable of making 
the right choices to protect them-
selves, their families, and their neigh-
bors. But now, because King Biden has 
gone back on his word or forgotten 
what he said, millions of Americans are 
facing an ultimatum: Get the vaccine 
or lose your job. For companies, it is 
either make your employees get the 
jab or lose your Federal contract. 
This is a complete overreach of 
power. Biden wants to control our lives 
and make the government be the au-
thority in every area of your life. No-
where in the Constitution does it say 
that Biden has this power—nowhere. 
Listen, I had COVID. I am grateful 
that I was able to get vaccinated. I 
hope that all Americans talk with 
their doctors and consider making the 
same decision. It is a personal decision 
every individual gets to make, but that 
is not how President Biden sees it. 
That is why I introduced multiple 
pieces of legislation to push back on 
these unconstitutional vaccine man-
dates. 
I have introduced the Freedom to Fly 
Act to prohibit the TSA from requiring 
Americans to show proof of vaccine or 
produce a vaccine passport and protect 
the privacy of American families. I 
don’t believe that the Federal Govern-
ment has any business requiring trav-
elers to turn over their personal med-
ical information to catch a flight. 
I introduced the Stop Mandating Ad-
ditional Requirements for Travel Act 
to prohibit the feds from requiring 
Americans to wear masks on public 
transportation like Amtrak or on air-
planes. 
I also introduced the Prevent Uncon-
stitutional Vaccine Mandates for Inter-
state Commerce Act, which would pre-
vent Federal Agencies like the Depart-
ment of Transportation from requiring 
proof of vaccination for companies try-
ing to do business across State lines. 
Last month, I introduced legislation 
to prevent vaccine mandates from 
being tied to a few of our Federal as-
sistance programs, like Medicare, So-
cial Security, food stamps, and public 
housing. I hoped everyone in this 
Chamber would have agreed that we 
shouldn’t force struggling American 
families to choose between Social Se-
curity disability checks and a personal 
health decision. 
Most Americans would be shocked if 
a politician said it is acceptable to 
deny someone health insurance or food 
stamps simply because of their vaccine 
status. Sadly, Madam President, this is 
exactly what happened on this floor 
last month. All I did was request that 
Americans, regardless of vaccine sta-
tus, should be able to access a few of 
our most essential government pro-
grams. My Democratic colleagues dis-
agreed every time. The Democratic 
Party leaves no room for disagreement. 
They leave no room for compromise. I 
think it is shameful. 
But unlike Joe Biden and Democrats 
in Washington, I don’t believe that 
government knows better than the 
American people. My parents didn’t 
have much of a formal education, but 
they worked hard and made the choices 
they felt were right for the health and 
well-being of our family. 
As Biden tries to control the lives of 
every American family, our economy is 
suffering. Inflation is already sky-
rocketing, and these vaccine mandates 
are going to add to it. 
Only weeks ago, the Federal Reserve 
published its latest Beige Book report. 
In the report, the Fed found that vac-
cine mandates were widely cited by 
businesses as a reason for low labor 
supply and hiring and retention issues. 
The Federal Reserve admitted what I 
have been warning about for weeks: 
Joe Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine 
mandates are causing higher turnover, 
driving Americans out of their jobs, 
and further fueling the devastating 
supply chain and inflation crisis plagu-
ing American families. 
When I think about the impact of 
vaccine mandates, I think about my 
dad. My dad was a truckdriver. Anyone 
who has driven trucks or has been close 
to someone in that line of work knows 
how demanding the job can be. There is 
already a driver shortage in this coun-
try, and we can’t afford to lose any 
more due to unconstitutional vaccine 
mandates. 
Consider first responders. Dozens of 
Massachusetts 
State 
troopers 
are 
threatening to resign over vaccine 
mandates. Los Angeles County could 
lose up to 10 percent of its police force. 
Chicago may see up to 50 percent of its 
police refusing to comply with vaccine 
mandates. Seattle is preparing for a 
mass exodus of officers in the coming 
weeks due to people who are quitting 
over vaccine mandates. 
For the past several months, we have 
been seeing rises in violent crime and 
problems in retaining police officers. 
We should not add to that ongoing 
problem by forcing police officers to 
choose between their jobs and taking a 
vaccine. 
I have called on Secretary Raimondo 
and Secretary Buttigieg to come before 
the Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation Committee to explain what they 
are doing to prevent U.S. supply chains 
from 
completely 
crumbling 
under 
Biden’s failed policies and mandates. 
Sadly, I haven’t heard a word from 
them, but I do see them on TV all the 
time. These people love to get on CNN 
and be commentators. That is not their 
job. Their job isn’t to just point out a 
problem; their job is to fix it. 
Now, we have all seen the disruption 
that this virus has caused. Many of us 
know someone who has fallen ex-
tremely ill or who has died because of 
COVID. That is why I am very appre-
ciative of all of those who have worked 
so hard to develop the vaccine. But I 
am 100 percent against these unconsti-
tutional mandates. 
Being vaccinated is a decision every 
American gets to make for himself. It 
is an authoritarian overreach by King 
Biden to threaten people with job loss 
unless they get the vaccine. Think 
about it. Why on Earth would a Presi-
dent do something they know is going 
to cost someone their job? 
Our job within government is to pro-
vide people with good information so 
they can make informed decisions and 
help create jobs, not kill them. But we 
are seeing that everything Joe Biden 
does makes things worse for families 
and businesses in Florida and across 
our great country. It is time he re-
scinds his proposed unconstitutional 
vaccine mandate. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to enter into a colloquy with 
my friend Senator MARSHALL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is no secret that President 
Biden’s COVID–19 vaccine mandates 
have drawn major opposition here in 
the Senate. My Republican colleagues 
and I have introduced multiple pieces 
of legislation that chip away at the 
various impractical, unethical, and 
downright unconstitutional aspects of 
this latest power grab. 
Last week, I introduced the Keeping 
our COVID–19 Heroes Employed Act, 
which would pull essential workers out 
from under these mandates and stop 
the White House from unilaterally fir-
ing them for refusing to submit to a 
shot. Think about how ludicrous that 
is. This, of course, is the heart of the 
issue. 
These pieces of legislation are not 
anti-vaccine. In fact, our opposition 
isn’t about vaccines at all. I have been 
vaccinated, and I encourage people to 
talk to their physicians. This is all 
about the precedent the Biden adminis-
tration is trying to set; namely, that it

November 3, 2021 
is acceptable for the Federal Govern-
ment to stand between a patient and 
their doctor and to overrule science 
and personal choice in the name of 
their personal political agenda. 
I think my colleague Senator MAR-
SHALL knows a thing or two about pre-
serving the importance of that doctor- 
patient relationship. 
Is that correct, Senator? 
Mr. MARSHALL. It is, indeed. Thank 
you so much, the senior Senator from 
Tennessee, for asking me about some-
thing so near and dear to my heart— 
the patient-physician relationship. 
I just want to start my remarks by 
saying that I support the vaccine. I 
support the vaccine, but I also support 
an individual’s right to decide whether 
he wants the vaccine or not. That is 
why I think it is so important to have 
this patient-physician relationship. 
I had the duty and the honor to treat 
thousands of women with a virus. I 
learned very quickly that the same 
virus could cause different problems 
for different patients, and it was based 
on their previous medical histories and 
their underlying medical problems as 
to what my advice might be. 
What my concern today is, is that so 
many of these heroes of yesterday, the 
COVID–19 heroes of yesterday, are now 
being treated so poorly. They are being 
told to get the jab or else lose their 
jobs. This mandate is going to lead to 
unemployment. It is going to lead to 
more inflation and further disrupt our 
supply chain. I just wish I could paint 
a face of all of these people from Kan-
sas who are reaching out to me, saying: 
Please don’t make me make this choice 
between the jab or my job. 
I think of the nurses whom I worked 
with in Liberal, KS, when the ICU was 
overflowing. I think of the nuclear en-
gineer folks and the union workers at 
Wolf Creek Nuclear energy who kept 
our electricity on. I think of those 
union workers who work for the De-
partment of Defense contracts in the 
aerospace industry, and now they are 
being kicked in the face. They are 
being told that they are no longer es-
sential, that they are no longer heroes. 
Senator BLACKBURN, I am supposing 
there are heroes in Tennessee who are 
now being forgotten as well. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes, indeed. You 
are correct, Senator MARSHALL. 
As I have said before, Tennessee is a 
supply chain and logistic State: ship-
ping, transportation, manufacturing. 
These are things that help form the 
backbone of our economy, and those in-
dustries employ thousands upon thou-
sands of people in our State. 
I will tell you, these thousands of 
people are speaking up, just as you 
have said they are speaking up in Kan-
sas. Every day, I hear from people who 
see what is happening on the ground, 
from small business owners to truck-
drivers, and they are sounding the 
alarm bells. They know that Joe 
Biden’s mandate will destroy their in-
dustries. They are just not asking for 
carve-outs; what they are saying is, 
give us a plan A, a plan B, a plan C; 
give us options. 
Senator MARSHALL, I believe you 
have taken a different approach to 
pushing back on some of these man-
dates. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Well, thank you 
Senator. Indeed, there are more op-
tions out there. There are, indeed, 
more tools in the tool shed that we can 
use. We plan to oppose any efforts to 
enforce Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate 
with all the other tools at our disposal, 
including blocking cloture on any con-
tinuing resolution in the absence of 
language protecting Americans from 
the mandates. In fact, 50 GOP Senators 
recently supported this as an amend-
ment to the CR in September. 
Senator BLACKBURN, I know that you 
also would be concerned about using 
any type of future funding to enforce 
this unconstitutional mandate. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes, indeed, Sen-
ator. I am very concerned. 
The Biden administration has, in-
deed, weaponized the U.S. Government 
against workers who love their jobs, 
against workers who are trying to earn 
a living and support their families. We 
have to stand up and defend them. 
Think about it. The Biden administra-
tion is using taxpayer dollars to imple-
ment a program designed to fire the 
very people we need to repair our sup-
ply chains, to bring manufacturing 
plants back online, and to keep the 
public safe. 
Yes, our law enforcement officers are 
very concerned about this, but don’t 
take my word for it. Ask some of these 
law enforcement unions. Ask the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the National 
Sheriffs’ Association, and the National 
Border Patrol Council what will hap-
pen if these mandates force them to 
fire their unvaccinated agents and offi-
cers. They are waving red flags right 
now because these mandates aren’t just 
impractical and unethical; they are 
dangerous. They will take these men 
and women off the frontlines and send 
them to the unemployment line and 
make us vulnerable. 
Am I correct on this point, Senator 
MARSHALL? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Senator BLACK-
BURN, absolutely. I can’t agree with 
you more. 
One of the big concerns I have is of 
our safety as well as our national secu-
rity. I know that both Tennessee and 
Kansas have Army and National Guard 
units, and I have been told that per-
haps half of the enlisted soldiers have 
not had their vaccines yet, and I en-
courage them to do that. But if they 
get separated from the military, it is 
going to leave a huge hole in our na-
tional security. 
I am also concerned about those Ac-
tive-Duty soldiers who are now being 
separated from the military as well for 
refusing the vaccine, and I am con-
cerned about what is going to happen 
to their records going forward. I was so 
discouraged when I found out the 
White House suggested these soldiers 
get a dishonorable discharge. 
In case you don’t know what a ‘‘dis-
honorable discharge’’ means, you could 
be treated like a felon. You lose your 
VA benefits, and you may lose some of 
your Second Amendment rights and 
some of your voting rights as well. 
Certainly, again, there is the impact 
on national security in losing thou-
sands of our soldiers. 
Senator BLACKBURN, I am sure that 
you have so many people who are 
reaching out to you of the COVID–19 
heroes of Tennessee. I appreciate your 
bringing this bill to the floor, and I am 
so happy and honored to support it. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, Sen-
ator. 
I am appreciative to the Senator 
from Kansas and to all of my col-
leagues who have joined me on the 
floor today to fight this dangerous 
precedent set by these mandates. 
I think it is so vitally important for 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to understand that the American 
people are not interested in playing 
chicken with Joe Biden—not at all. 
This isn’t contrarian politics to them; 
this is a line in the sand between a 
power-hungry President who wants to 
strip them of their fundamental rights 
and get them fired from their jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, during the recent Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing, I asked 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Defense 
what 
I 
thought was a simple question: As the 
leader of the Department of Defense, 
was he against dishonorable discharges 
for members of the military who de-
cided not to get the COVID vaccine. He 
hemmed and hawed around, but he 
never answered my question. But, to 
me, it is simple. The answer should be 
that we will not dishonorably dis-
charge those who serve honorably. 
Our country is defended by the brav-
est men and women in the world. All 
raised their hands and pledged their 
lives to defend our Nation and our way 
of 
life. 
Our 
servicemembers 
stand 
watch while we go to work, while we 
spend time with our families, and while 
we enjoy freedoms they vow to protect. 
When COVID broke out, our military 
was there for America. Military mem-
bers were mobilized in all 50 States to 
serve as nurses and doctors at hos-
pitals. They drove ambulances and set 
up food banks. They delivered critical 
supplies. They worked to keep order. 
But how does the President thank 
them for their service? With a dishon-
orable discharge for deciding not to 
take the vaccine. That is ridiculous. 
Receiving a dishonorable discharge 
means they will lose all of their vet-
erans’ benefits and their pensions. In 
some States, it is on par with having a 
felony conviction. That means they 
lose their ability to vote or to carry a 
gun, not to mention what it does to 
their ability to find a new job. A dis-
honorable discharge is and should con-
tinue to be handed down for only the

most reprehensible conduct in the mili-
tary. 
Now, I am for the vaccine. I have 
taken it, and my family has taken it, 
and I continue to encourage others to 
talk about it and talk to their doctors 
about it. I also respect the chain of 
command. I know how important it is 
for soldiers to follow orders. But this 
vaccine is still new, and I am sure the 
Department of Defense can look at 
other ways to manage our force rather 
than to put a stain on the reputations 
of the men and women who wanted to 
serve and have served their country, 
which brings me to another point 
about the impact of the Biden adminis-
tration’s vaccine mandates. 
When 
President 
Biden 
made 
his 
sweeping vaccine mandates, he did so 
with the hubris or excessive confidence 
that Americans would just support the 
policy simply because it was his com-
petent 
administration 
that 
imple-
mented them, but the mandates are 
shortsighted, they are ill-conceived, 
and they threaten our national secu-
rity. Here is how. 
First, it creates a false choice for our 
defense contractors. They are forced to 
choose between coming to their job and 
working to support our military or 
taking a new vaccine that they don’t 
want. Their decision should be between 
their doctor and their patient. 
Second, it puts the important and 
critical performance of our defensive 
industry in jeopardy. Alabama alone is 
home to 5,000 defense contractors. 
When these firms are unable to per-
form, our country is at risk. 
Third, the guidance for compliance is 
changed with little or no warning. This 
moving of regulatory goalposts creates 
uncertainty and drives up compliance 
costs, especially for smaller firms that 
lack large HR departments. 
So last week, I called on the Senate 
Armed Services Committee Chairman 
JACK REED to schedule a hearing on 
this issue. I want to hear straight from 
the small business owners who are 
struggling to figure out how to comply. 
We need to know just how disruptions 
in their ability to complete their work 
may impact the defense supply chain. 
I also want to hear from expert wit-
nesses within the Department of De-
fense. We need to have a full picture of 
the current state of vaccine compli-
ance. 
If the Senate were to take action on 
a solution, it is critical that we have 
all the facts. 
I also sent a letter to the President, 
urging him to reverse course on his 
Federal contractor mandate. 
On Monday, the White House backed 
down from their arbitrary deadline of 
December 8, with the announcement of 
new flexibilities in their guidance. 
While this step is in the right direc-
tion, they haven’t gone far enough. 
The vaccine mandate is still a com-
pliance burden on small contractors, 
no matter how flexible the White 
House tries to make them. 
Our workforce still will be unneces-
sarily impacted and our national secu-
rity will still be at risk. 
So I would encourage the White 
House to focus on protecting Ameri-
cans’ liberties while pursuing a holistic 
strategy to combat COVID. 
It is time that President Biden recog-
nizes that mandates are not the an-
swer; frank conversations between doc-
tors and patients are the answer. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the United 
States is facing economic challenges 
that we haven’t experienced in this 
country for decades. The supply chain 
crunch is leading to backlogged ports, 
and that, in turn, is spilling over into 
empty shelves. Inflation is exacting a 
punishing toll on American families; 
on their budgets, on their quality of 
life. 
And it is not the well-off families 
that are being most harmed by it, no. 
It is those who are least prepared to 
endure that. It is America’s poor and 
middle class; those who are working 
hard to survive from day to day, trying 
to reach that American dream, trying 
to ascend the economic ladder that the 
American dream has long enabled. 
Now, each of these problems, in its 
own right, would be a really serious 
and vexing primary concern for most 
people and most businesses, even dur-
ing normal economic times. But these 
are far from normal economic times. 
In fact, when businesses are polled, 
their primary concern isn’t about any 
of these things. It is the labor short-
age. Businesses are struggling to find 
workers. The Joint Economic Com-
mittee Republicans released a report 
recently explaining that Americans 
have lost many vital connections to 
work. Government policies and social 
pressures are leading to a lower labor 
force participation rate than at any 
time in decades. 
This trend is worrying not only be-
cause work helps Americans put food 
on the table—and it does, and it is nec-
essary to do that—but also because 
work often provides a sense of accom-
plishment and belonging and self- 
worth. Work is a social good in its own 
right. 
But businesses across the country are 
struggling to find workers, and that is 
leading to more of these same prob-
lems, leading to higher prices on things 
that people need to buy. All this is 
making everything else more com-
plicated, more difficult for America’s 
poor and middle class. 
I have spoken to businessowners in 
Utah, who are closing their doors for 
days each week because they can’t find 
workers. Some businesses are offering 
extremely generous salaries and sign-
ing bonuses for those who are willing 
to work. Nonetheless, they are still 
struggling to find employees. 
Now, work is often the primary con-
nection Americans have with peers. 
Work provides a sense of involvement, 
taxpayer responsibility, and commu-
nity with others. Work is also the way 
we get things done. It is how we manu-
facture, farm, mine, and build. Work is 
a requisite for prosperity at any level, 
in any form. 
Unfortunately, President Biden is 
making work more difficult and less 
enticing, increasingly less possible. 
Raising taxes on Americans gives them 
less incentive to work, and as the Penn 
Wharton Budget Model shows, the 
Democrats’ trimmed-down plan would 
cost almost $4 trillion over 10 years 
and cost American taxpayers $1.5 tril-
lion in new taxes. 
Through his unconstitutional and 
sweeping vaccine mandate, President 
Biden is forcing countless American 
workers out of a job and preventing 
others from joining or rejoining the 
workforce. This is far from a mere ab-
stract 
constitutional 
transgression. 
This is a constitutional violation that 
goes far beyond the text of a document 
that extends deeply into the lives of 
the American people, especially the 
poor and the middle class. 
I have now heard from over 300 Utah-
ans who are at risk of losing their live-
lihoods due to this mandate. Their sto-
ries are gut-wrenching. Their stories 
are tragic. Their stories remind me of 
how indefensible and inexcusable and 
immoral this vaccine mandate truly is. 
These are ordinary, everyday, hard- 
working Americans who all too often 
are just trying to make ends meet, put 
food on the table, provide for their 
families, and otherwise get by. 
Many of them have legitimate med-
ical, moral, or religious objections. 
Many of them work for employers who 
have no desire to implement the man-
date and who themselves are worried 
about their ability to keep their busi-
nesses open. 
Now, I have heard from a number of 
Utah businesses whose management 
and ownership have expressed these 
exact same feelings, and I have heard 
from Utah workers who have expressed 
these feelings over and over and over 
again. Let me tell you about a few peo-
ple I have heard from who have de-
scribed this awful situation. 
Now, one Utah business in the high- 
tech space has expressed concern about 
losing valuable employees due to the 
mandate. The business that I am refer-
ring to at the moment has imple-
mented policies to encourage vaccina-
tion and recognizes, of course, the 
value that vaccination can bring to the 
workforce. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
businessowners are uncomfortable with 
making these decisions for their em-
ployees. 
The 
business’s 
management 
said: 
‘‘We feel strongly that it is not the 
government’s right to require vaccina-
tion.’’ 
They are absolutely right. 
A growing Utah food manufacturer 
with 350 employees is very worried 
about the mandate’s impact on that 
company’s ability to keep product 
moving. This business plays an impor-
tant role in food supply chains in Utah, 
throughout the Western United States, 
and throughout the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7706 
November 3, 2021 
Leaders of this business said: ‘‘This 
mandate is government overreach, is 
outside the scope and purpose of OSHA, 
and will have dire consequences on our 
company and our economy in this ex-
tremely tight labor market.’’ 
They know that some of their work-
force would quit if the mandate were 
enforced. 
Another Utah business is similarly 
worried. This larger operation’s leader-
ship said: ‘‘We are in a difficult labor 
situation. It is a daily struggle to be 
fully staffed and produce the products 
our customers expect. Some of our em-
ployees have stated they will quit if 
forced to be vaccinated. Any disruption 
in our labor force will be critical to our 
operations, and a disruption in our 
labor force not only means some of our 
customers may not receive product 
they expect, it may mean local, time- 
sensitive supply would not get proc-
essed. That disruption would be dev-
astating.’’ 
Now, it is important here that I not 
be misunderstood. I am against the 
mandate, but I support the vaccine. I 
have been vaccinated. I have encour-
aged others to be vaccinated. These 
vaccines are helping countless people 
avoid 
the 
harms 
associated 
with 
COVID–19. But this mandate is already 
doing serious harm to our economy and 
to people who want the right, the basic 
human right, to make their own med-
ical decisions. 
That is why I, along with my col-
league, the Senator from Kansas, Dr. 
MARSHALL—Senator MARSHALL
and I 
have sent a letter directly to the ma-
jority leader, Senator SCHUMER. We 
have advised him, months before the 
current spending period ends in Decem-
ber, that we will oppose any funding 
legislation that enables the enforce-
ment of President Biden’s employer 
vaccine mandate. 
It is essential to remember here that 
Congress, the branch of government 
most accountable to the people at the 
most regular intervals, this is where 
the Constitution places the power of 
the purse. This is where the Constitu-
tion places the power to pass legisla-
tion. Congress, not the President, has 
the authority to decide how Federal 
funds are spent. 
Now, we believe our funds would be 
misspent in this way or any endeavor 
that would harm Utahans and Kansans 
and all Americans, would worsen our 
difficult economic situation, or would 
take away fundamental medical free-
doms. 
This now marks the thirteenth day 
that I have come to the Senate floor to 
oppose the mandate. I am going to con-
tinue to do so for as long as it takes to 
beat the mandate. I encourage all of 
my colleagues to join me in this effort. 
And when I say that, I want to be 
clear. I am not speaking to one side of 
the aisle or the other. I invite all to 
join me in this cause. Why? Well, be-
cause Americans overwhelmingly—re-
gardless of whether they live in a red 
State or a blue State or a purple State, 
Americans overwhelmingly oppose this 
mandate. 
According to a poll recently reported 
on in Axios—hardly a rightwing publi-
cation—revealed that 14 percent—just 
14 percent—of Americans believe that 
the response to someone not receiving 
the vaccine should involve them losing 
their job. 
Just 14 percent of Americans agree 
with President Biden that you should 
have to choose between keeping your 
job and getting a vaccine that might go 
against your religious beliefs or that 
might worsen a preexisting medical 
condition that has caused your doctor 
to advise you to be cautious in getting 
the vaccine. 
These decisions are not those of the 
President of the United States to 
make. You see, he doesn’t have that 
power. My copy of the Constitution 
says that the power to make law rests 
in this branch of government, the legis-
lative branch, the Congress. And my 
copy of the Constitution says that he 
can’t make law, which he essentially 
did when he purported to have and pur-
ported to plan to exercise the power 
unilaterally, acting alone, to require 
every worker at every employer that 
has more than 100 employees—more 
than 99 employees to get the vaccine or 
be fired. 
This isn’t right. Deep down, the 
American people know it isn’t right. 
Deep down they know that this is not 
a partisan issue. This is an unabashed 
power grab by the President of the 
United States. It is not one that is of 
the sort that the American people will 
accept kindly. 
I have said before, I am not sure I can 
think of a more egregious example of a 
President exercising power that is not 
his own in many decades. 
This is, in some ways, reminiscent of 
President Harry Truman’s decision to 
seize every steel mill in America in 
order to make sure that the output 
could be dedicated to the Korean war 
effort. The American people didn’t 
smile upon that one. Neither did the 
Supreme Court of the United States, 
which, within weeks of President Tru-
man’s action on April 8, 1952, decided 
that he didn’t have that authority. 
Some may ask: Well, if it is so uncon-
stitutional here, why hasn’t the Su-
preme Court acted? 
I will tell you why. Because Presi-
dent Biden hasn’t had the basic de-
cency to issue an order explaining a 
basis for his authority and providing a 
basis for someone to challenge the le-
gitimacy of his authority to order 
every business with more than 99 em-
ployees—to force its entire workforce 
to get vaccinated. He hasn’t had the 
decency to do that. 
Consequently, no one can sue yet. 
Consequently, employers everywhere 
with more than 99 employees are forced 
to guess as to what it would look like. 
And in the meantime, their lawyers 
with good reason and their risk man-
agement departments and their human 
resources departments are understand-
ably saying: We don’t want to get 
caught flatfooted, especially because 
we have been threatened as employers 
with $70,000 per day, per person, mount-
ing civil monetary penalties. 
This would be crippling to any busi-
ness. 
So what are they doing? 
Well, they are getting ahead of it. 
They are guessing as to what the most 
extreme version of the OSHA mandate 
might look like, and then they are ex-
ceeding that. And they are already in 
the process of threatening termination 
and, in some ways, in some cases, im-
posing it. 
In many cases, they are not even 
having the decency to fire them. They 
are, instead, putting them on unpaid 
administrative leave. This is especially 
cruel because it renders them com-
pletely ineligible for unemployment. 
So, Mr. President, I ask you: Is this 
moral? Is this just? 
Setting aside for a moment the ques-
tion of whether this is constitutional— 
and I assure you, unequivocally, it is 
not. But even setting aside that ques-
tion, is it moral? Is it proper? Is it ac-
ceptable to do this to America’s poor 
and middle class? 
It is not. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator LANKFORD for 
letting me take 3 minutes to honor an 
Iowan who recently passed away, a 
former Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives. And I think there is only 
one other United States Senator who 
would know who I am talking about, 
and this would be Senator SCHUMER, 
who served with this former Member of 
Congress from 1981 to 1995. 
REMEMBERING NEAL SMITH 
Mr. President, I would like to take a 
moment to pay tribute to former Iowa 
Congressman Neal Smith, who passed 
away yesterday at the age of 101. 
He was a true public servant. He en-
tered public life for the right reasons 
and had no interest in self-promotion. 
He cared about Iowa and tried to do his 
best for our State, and he did. 
Neal Smith was a humble but impres-
sive man. He was a decorated bomber 
pilot in World War II. After attending 
Drake University Law School with his 
wife, Bea, and opening a practice with 
her, he became active in local govern-
ment. 
In 1958, Neal Smith was elected to 
the House of Representatives, where he 
served for 36 years. That is longer than 
any other Iowan has served in the 
House of Representatives. 
When I was first elected to Congress 
as the only Republican in the Iowa del-
egation, Neal Smith forgot about poli-
tics and was a mentor to me. I have 
never forgotten that. I try to follow his 
example. We worked in a bipartisan 
way on behalf of the people in Iowa, 
just as it should be. 
I remember Congressman Smith as a 
real defender of agriculture, small

business, as a great Iowan, and as a 
good friend. 
Barbara and I extend our condolences 
to his family. They will be in my pray-
ers. 
I yield the floor and thank Senator 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
VACCINES 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
have a real concern for our economy, 
for the future of what is happening 
right now, and a lot of it wraps around 
the vaccine mandates that are being 
laid down by President Biden. 
On September 9, President Biden had 
announced: I am losing patience with 
the American people, and it is time for 
you to get vaccinated. 
And he laid down a rule on every 
Federal worker, every Federal con-
tractor, everyone in the military, and 
everyone who is in a private business 
with 100 employees or more. He created 
a new mandate. 
He literally reached into union shops 
and 
changed 
their 
collective 
bar-
gaining agreement unilaterally and 
said: The President’s going to add a 
new feature in your collective bar-
gaining agreement, and it is going to 
be that you are going to have a vaccine 
or you are going to be fired. 
He told every police officer; he told 
every firefighter; he told every doctor, 
every nurse; he told every member of 
the military, no matter how many 
badges they wear or how many decora-
tions they received: You will be fired if 
you don’t follow my instructions. 
It didn’t matter if they were front-
line workers. It didn’t matter if they 
laid their lives on the line all of last 
year. It didn’t matter. He declared to 
them: You will be fired if you don’t fol-
low my instructions. 
He made it very, very clear: If you 
have already had COVID and recovered 
and have natural immunity, I don’t 
care. 
If your personal doctor has told you 
not to—his perspective in what is com-
ing down is, if the CDC from Wash-
ington, DC, says it’s OK, it doesn’t 
matter what your personal doctor says. 
While he said you can have a reli-
gious accommodation, so far, as I 
checked in with the military services, 
no one has been given a military or re-
ligious accommodation. And across the 
Federal workforce, I have yet to hear a 
soul getting a religious accommoda-
tion. 
The words are: ‘‘We are going to pay 
attention to your local doctor.’’ 
The reality has been totally dif-
ferent. And we have pushed in every 
way possible against this administra-
tion, and will continue to do that not 
because it is unjust, not because, quite 
frankly, I think the vaccine is the 
wrong thing to do—I think it is the 
right thing to do—but the mandate is 
absolutely the wrong thing to do. 
Americans have a lot of different rea-
sons to not take a vaccine. Allow 
Americans to be Americans. 
I have a friend of mine who, by the 
way, is a liberal Democrat. Yes, I have 
liberal Democrat friends. He called me 
and said his son has had long-term 
COVID. Eight months he has been in 
recovery from COVID. He does not 
want to have the vaccine not knowing 
how his body will react to that. This 
week, he will lose his job because the 
President of the United States told him 
he is losing his patience. 
That is not right. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. President, on a separate but re-
lated subject, we continue to be able to 
walk toward a $2 trillion proposal com-
ing down. We hear the House is taking 
it up even in the next 24 to 48 hours. Of 
course, we heard that over and over 
again lately. 
There has been a real concern about 
what is happening in the economy be-
cause of rising inflation. Oklahomans 
are paying $175 more a month right 
now for their basic utilities, groceries, 
and gasoline—$175 more a month that 
they are paying because of the rising 
inflation that has happened this year. 
That inflation, you can take it right 
back to the middle of March, when a $2 
trillion package was passed in this 
body on a straight partisan vote that 
everyone on this side of the aisle was 
saying: Don’t do this. This will cause 
rising inflation. 
And it was done anyway. 
As simple as I can state it, it was if 
you add a lot of extra money and you 
discourage people from working, you 
will get fewer products and more buy-
ers. It is not hard to be able to see 
what is going to happen as a result of 
that. 
Larry Summers, who used to be my 
Democratic colleagues’ favorite econo-
mist—he was the National Economic 
Council director to President Obama— 
has been a very outspoken progressive 
economist. He wrote in February, chal-
lenging this body not to do that $2 tril-
lion package, saying this: 
There is the risk of inflation expectations 
rising sharply. Stimulus measures of the 
magnitude contemplated are steps into the 
unknown. For credibility, they need to be ac-
companied by clear statements that the con-
sequences will be monitored closely. 
At that same time in February, he 
said: 
Based on the proposal that’s out there, 
there will be an individual that normally has 
$22,000 worth of normal income in a year that 
will move to $30,000 in benefits for the year, 
and that will cause problems. 
And, boy, has it. Employment all 
over the country has had all kinds of 
chaotic moments where employers are 
trying to hire employees and they are 
making more on benefits than they are 
at work, and it has caused all sorts of 
chaos across our economy. 
It is interesting, several progressive 
economists in March of this year, right 
after the bill passed, made general 
statements, like: ‘‘A relief plan is dif-
ferent than a stimulus.’’ 
It doesn’t matter. It is not a stim-
ulus. It is a relief plan, so we can spend 
as much as we want. 
This was my favorite—one of the 
economists came out and said: ‘‘The 
risk of generalized overheating in the 
goods market appears low . . . ’’ 
‘‘The risk of generalized overheating 
in the goods market appears low . . . ’’ 
That was the statement of the econo-
mists in March of this year. 
Yet the reality is, this year, there is 
a backup at the Port of Long Beach 
and people can’t get supplies all over 
the country, and exactly what was 
forecast in February and March is oc-
curring in our economy right now. 
Larry Summers again identified it 
this way. He made the statement: 
The pandemic had punched a $20 billion 
hole in Americans’ monthly wage income 
[and] Biden [has] proposed filling it with $100 
billion. 
He said: 
I know the bathtub has been too empty, 
but one has to think about what the capacity 
of the bathtub is and how much water we’re 
trying to flow into it. 
What do I mean by that? 
That $2 trillion package that was in 
March caused all the economic issues 
of this year. It has caused all the infla-
tion, all the challenges in employment 
across our economy and across our 
workforce. 
It is now being followed up, appar-
ently, by another $2 trillion proposal 
that is coming in the coming days. If 
we had giant inflation with the last 
one—by the way, with the highest in-
flation rate since 1982. If we had that 
inflation from that $2 trillion package, 
what is going to happen when you put 
another $2 trillion on top of the last $2 
trillion in this economy? 
The simple fact is, quoting Larry 
Summers, we don’t know what will 
happen. We are literally taking ‘‘steps 
into the unknown.’’ But I can tell you, 
it is not hard to predict. 
That is just the economic issues. 
As I look at this package—it is hard 
to be able to look at the package that 
is being proposed. I have heard quite a 
few folks back in Oklahoma on the 
weekend say to me: What all is in this 
$2 trillion package that a couple weeks 
ago was at $3.5 trillion? Now we hear it 
is $2 trillion. What actually is in it? 
And I smile at them and say: I am 
not sure yet. I hear bits and pieces. 
To tell you how much it is moving 
around, last week, when it was released 
to the public, it was 2,400 pages. By this 
morning, it was 1,700 pages. But wait. 
Now this afternoon, it is 2,000 pages 
long. That is in a week. It has moved 
from 2,400 pages to 1,700 pages, to 2,000 
pages, as the proposal continues to be 
able to change over and over again. 
It is incredibly difficult to be able to 
track what all is in it, but we can 
track some things that are in it. 
There is a massive hole that is hold-
ing for immigration, as we have now 
seen three different major proposals on 
immigration on how to be able to give 
amnesty to the largest number of peo-
ple. Several have already been knocked 
down by the Parliamentarian, but it 
seems to come back again just to try

November 3, 2021 
to find a new way to be able to do am-
nesty for as many people that are here 
illegally present in our country as pos-
sible. That seems to be a piece of this 
economic proposal that is out there. 
We do know in this proposal that it 
finds as many ways as possible to be 
able to fund gaps in Hyde funding. 
Now, what is that? 
Using Federal dollars to be able to 
pay for abortions in our country—an 
agreement that has been in our coun-
try since 1976—that we have strong dis-
agreements on a child’s life. 
I happen to believe that a child is a 
child is a child, and every child is valu-
able, no matter how small they are. 
Many of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle don’t believe children 
are valuable until they can see them. 
They have to be born before they are 
valuable. I believe there is no dif-
ference in a child in the womb than a 
child outside the womb other than 
time. 
This bill is full of areas to go around 
the Hyde rules to start allowing the 
funding with Federal dollars to pay for 
the taking of human life. 
I am disappointed how obsessed my 
Democrat colleagues seem to be about 
finding new ways to pay for the taking 
of human life of children. That has not 
been so, even as recently as 2 years 
ago. 
Quite frankly, Senator Biden was 
outspoken about protecting the Hyde 
protections. Now, President Biden and 
this body seem to be focused on how 
many ways we can increase abortions 
in America. 
There are a lot of energy aspects in 
this: the new tax on natural gas, where 
just 5 or 6 years ago, we called the 
‘‘bridge fuel to the future’’ to be able 
to reduce carbon. Now, natural gas is 
receiving 
punishment 
in 
this 
in 
brandnew taxes. 
There is a block on production from 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Some of my Democratic colleagues cel-
ebrate, saying: ‘‘We are going to cut off 
anything from Alaska and protect that 
region,’’ which is remarkable to me. 
We are now buying more oil from Rus-
sia than we are from Alaska, right 
now—twice as much, in fact, more oil 
from Russia than we are from Alaska. 
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
is an area 19.3 million square acres— 
19.3 million acres. That is about half 
the size of my home State of Okla-
homa. That is an enormously large 
area. And in that area, there are 2,000 
acres that would actually be set aside 
for oil production. So to put it in per-
spective, ANWR is half the size of my 
State of Oklahoma, and the oil produc-
tion area that will be needed is a third 
of the size of the airport that I fly out 
of, the Will Rogers airport in Okla-
homa City. 
If you took a third of the size of the 
airport, that is the size of, actually, 
the oil production area that will be 
needed in an area half the size of my 
entire State. Yet that is being blocked 
in this bill. 
We will see the price of energy go up, 
but we will see a new benefit for elec-
tric vehicles that are here. For even 
very, very wealthy Americans, they 
will get a benefit of $12,500 on new lux-
ury vehicles that they want to be able 
to purchase, as long as they are elec-
tric. 
There are direct attacks on the 
school choice in this bill that actually 
goes after any kind of private institu-
tion or faith-based institution. It says 
that you will get funding for a secular 
government school for one level, but if 
you are in a faith-based school, it is a 
different level or none at all. 
If you are in a pre-K program or a 
childcare program—and in many rural 
communities all across our State, when 
you come to Oklahoma, in many rural 
communities, the pre-K program and 
the childcare program is run from a 
local church. Oh, but they won’t be al-
lowed to be able to be a provider in 
this. You have to be a secular provider 
because religious institutions are being 
blocked out by this bill. 
It does supersize the IRS, though. It 
adds $79 billion to the IRS to increase 
audits—$79 billion. To give you a per-
spective of how big that is, the normal 
IRS budget for a year is $12 billion. Yet 
this bill gives an additional $79 billion 
to the IRS to be able to increase au-
dits. And if anyone has a belief those 
audits are only going to connect to 
people that make $400,000 or more, I 
have a bridge to sell you. 
I have to tell you, as I read through 
the bill—and it does take some time, 
and it is difficult to be able to get 
through it because it is changing so 
much—I am amazed at some of the 
things that are in it that have been 
slipped through this: $350 million are 
sent to unions to provide for electronic 
voting systems for unions—$350 mil-
lion. There are $4.28 billion being set 
aside for training activities in industry 
sectors and occupations for climate re-
silience. There are whole sections in 
this bill, as I go through it, that are set 
aside for specific areas: $20 million for 
State, local, and Tribal governments to 
mitigate online services to the dot-gov 
internet domain. To be able to help cit-
ies go to the dot-gov internet domain, 
there is $20 million that is set aside. 
And there are some set aside for even 
some of my colleagues who are here 
today on the floor: $49 million carve- 
out for Native Hawaiian climate resil-
ience programs in the Office of Native 
Hawaiian Relations. 
It depends on the State that you are 
in and the perspective that you are in, 
but as I go through this bill and start 
identifying the programs, I hear broad 
descriptions of different programs, and 
I hear all these different sales of what 
is in it. But when you read through the 
bill, when you go through the details of 
the bill, this is the kind of stuff that 
you find. 
Oh, by the way, one last piece in this 
ever-changing bill, just within the last 
hour and a half, they have added a new 
section of the bill over in the House 
side. It is a bill dealing with State and 
local tax deductions that will help the 
wealthiest Americans get a bigger tax 
cut. Yes, I did say that correctly. Cur-
rently, for Americans who are in high- 
taxed States, they can only deduct 
$10,000 of their State and local taxes, 
only $10,000 off their State and local 
taxes that they can actually deduct 
from their Federal tax. 
The new proposal that just came out 
in the last hour from the House of Rep-
resentatives increases that to $72,500 in 
deductions off your State and local 
taxes. That will be a great tax benefit 
to the wealthiest Americans—$72,500. 
All that we are asking is, Show us 
what the real bill is. Let Americans be 
able to see the real bill. Have the 
transparency and the ability to be able 
to actually track through what this 
will mean day to day, what this will 
mean to our economy, because we have 
seen what $2 trillion did to our econ-
omy this March—what is another $2 
trillion going to mean on top of all of 
that coming up this fall? 
I think we are walking into the un-
known, except this time, I think we do 
know what is about to happen to our 
economy. We need to see this bill and 
stop this bill before it damages our 
economy even more than we have al-
ready been damaged. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
look forward to responding to my col-
league in the future, but I can tell you 
that people I know around the country 
want to see their costs go down, and 
that is exactly what this bill is about. 
It is about bringing families’ costs 
down, from childcare to taking care of 
loved ones; seniors; to bring down the 
cost of prescription drugs—something 
that has eluded our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, despite a lot of 
claims that they would do something 
about it. 
So we look forward to debating this 
bill and getting it done. 
AMERICAN INNOVATION AND CHOICE ONLINE ACT 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today to speak on behalf of a very im-
portant piece of new legislation that is 
bipartisan. 
I introduced this bill, the American 
Innovation and Choice Online Act, in 
the last month with Senator GRASS-
LEY, who was here with us today and 
will be here shortly; as well as my col-
leagues Senator DURBIN, the chair of 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee; 
Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, the former chair of 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee; 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL, who is here with us 
today; Senator JOHN KENNEDY of Lou-
isiana; Senator CORY BOOKER; Senator 
JOSH HAWLEY; Senator CYNTHIA LUM-
MIS; and Senator MAZIE HIRONO, who is 
here with us today; as well as Senator 
MARK WARNER. 
America has a major monopoly power 
problem, and nowhere is this more ob-
vious than with tech. It is because, in 
part, it is 20 percent of our economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7709 
November 3, 2021 
And while we love the new jobs, the 
new ideas, the new technology that 
have come out, we all know that you 
can’t just do nothing on privacy, do 
nothing on competition, and that our 
competition laws haven’t been updated 
in any serious way since the invention 
of the internet. 
I am here, again, joined with Senator 
GRASSLEY. I am going to let him go 
ahead of me and then turn to Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and Senator HIRONO, and I 
will finish up because they have been 
very patient. 
I so appreciate Senator GRASSLEY’s 
leadership in this area; one, to make 
sure the FTC and the Department of 
Justice Antitrust have the funding 
they need with the bill that we passed 
through this Chamber to update merg-
er fees, as well as the work that we are 
doing right now. It is so important on 
self-preferencing. 
It is this simple: Companies, just be-
cause they are dominant platforms, 
shouldn’t be able to put their own stuff 
in front of everyone else that adver-
tises on our platform. They shouldn’t 
be able to steal ideas and data and de-
velop products off the people who are 
simply trying to advertise their prod-
ucts on the platform and develop 
knockoffs, which is exactly what we 
know, from some really good reporting 
from the Wall Street Journal and oth-
ers, has been happening. 
And they shouldn’t be able to, be-
cause they are dominant platforms, 
tell people who advertise: Hey, if you 
want to get your stuff near the top of 
the search engine, then you are going 
to have to buy a whole bunch of things 
from us. 
That is what reunites us on this bill, 
the simple concept of competition. 
I turn it over to my friend, my neigh-
bor from the State of Iowa, Senator 
GRASSLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it 
was a pleasure to work on this legisla-
tion with Senator KLOBUCHAR, so we 
joined forces—it happens to turn out 
that there are 10 of our Senate col-
leagues—in a bipartisan way to intro-
duce this legislation that we call the 
American Innovation and Choice On-
line Act. 
This bill has garnered support from 
all sides of the political spectrum and, 
of course, is a very commonsense meas-
ure, which is meant to increase com-
petition on dominant digital platforms. 
Today, there are only a handful of 
dominant companies that control what 
Americans can buy, what they hear, 
and what they say online. 
Big Tech has powers over the econ-
omy that we haven’t seen in genera-
tions or perhaps ever, and this power 
grows even larger, taking over yet 
more of our daily lives. With this 
power, Big Tech is able to pick winners 
and losers on their platforms. 
The goal of the American Innovation 
and Choice Online Act is to ensure that 
Big Tech can be held accountable when 
they engage in a discriminatory and 
anticompetitive manner. 
This legislation sets clear rules that 
businesses on dominant platforms must 
follow. This will help promote competi-
tion by targeting harmful conduct, 
while ensuring that innovation and 
pro-consumer conduct is protected. 
I want to be clear. Big Tech plat-
forms offer great products to their con-
sumers. This isn’t about breaking up 
companies or penalizing them for being 
successful. This is about ensuring that 
small businesses have a fair and even 
playing field when utilizing a dominant 
online platform. 
I also want to address many of the 
falsehoods that have been spread by 
the opponents of this legislation. Noth-
ing in this bill will require a company 
to shut down their marketplace or pre-
vent those companies from selling 
their own branded politics. 
Also, nothing prevents a search com-
pany from showing maps or answer 
boxes in their search results. And, also, 
cellular 
phones 
can 
be 
sold 
with 
preinstalled apps. This bill simply sets 
clear, effective rules to protect com-
petition and users doing business on 
dominant online platforms. 
I am a strong believer in the free 
market. The United States is still the 
greatest country in the world for start-
ing and growing businesses. But Big 
Tech is making it more difficult for 
small businesses to realize success on 
these dominant platforms. So with this 
legislation, Congress must update our 
laws to keep up with the growing and 
evolving online ecosystem. 
Big Tech has the power to determine 
when and what we can buy, see, and 
say online. Big Tech also has the power 
to destroy companies, small and large, 
by denying them access to consumers 
and even to the internet itself. 
It is time that we ensure there is ef-
fective antitrust enforcement so the 
American people can take the power 
back from these Big Tech giants. 
I want to again thank Senator KLO-
BUCHAR for her work with me on this 
legislation. I also want to thank all of 
my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle who have joined in cosponsoring 
this legislation. 
In the House of Representatives, we 
have Congressmen CICILLINE and BUCK, 
who introduced a similar bill earlier 
this year, which has already been 
marked up and passed out of the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
The American Innovation and Choice 
Online Act is a bipartisan, bicameral 
bill, and I hope that we can move it 
forward so we end up bringing real, 
positive change to the benefit of all 
Americans. 
I yield the floor and thank Senator 
KLOBUCHAR once again. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator GRASSLEY for his leader-
ship in working with colleagues, and I 
am glad he mentioned Representatives 
CICILLINE and BUCK. They are quite the 
bipartisan duo. But, then, we worked 
with them to make some changes to 
this legislation in order to bring it to 
our colleagues, and we are very proud 
of the work we have done. We think it 
is going to make a big, big difference. 
With that, I will turn it over to Sen-
ator HIRONO. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, before 
turning to the bipartisan bill that 
brings a number of us to the floor this 
afternoon, we have been listening to a 
number of my Republican colleagues 
throw stones at Build Back Better, and 
I would like to simply state for the 
record that Democrats are committed 
to lowering costs for families, such as 
making childcare more affordable, and 
home care for seniors. Democrats are 
committed to lowering taxes for peo-
ple, such as the child tax credit that, 
by the way, provides much needed fi-
nancial support for families, including 
for the families of over 200,000 children 
in Hawaii alone—all by making the 
richest people in our country, who got 
the benefit of $1.5 trillion in totally un-
necessary tax cuts that the Repub-
licans pushed through—by making the 
richest people in our country pay for 
these much needed programs and actu-
ally support American families. 
Meanwhile, what are the Republicans 
doing? Nothing. Zero. Nothing for 
American families. So I would like to 
set the record straight as to who actu-
ally is working hard to help American 
families, and, believe me, it is not the 
Republicans. 
AMERICAN INNOVATION AND CHOICE ONLINE ACT 
Mr. President, turning to the bill 
that we are talking about today, to-
day’s big tech behemoths like to tout 
their claimed consumer-focused ap-
proaches—Amazon, with its ability to 
deliver seemingly any product to your 
doorstep within 2 days; Google, with its 
goal of organizing the world’s informa-
tion and making it accessible to all; 
Apple, with its mission of bringing the 
best personal computing products and 
support to the end user; and Facebook, 
looking to give users the power to 
build communities and bring the world 
closer together. Each claims that their 
success has been the direct result of 
their consumer focus, that consumers 
choose their products and services be-
cause they are the best in class. 
That may have been true at some 
point, but it is certainly not true 
today. Today, consumers have no real 
choice. Amazon, Google, Apple, and 
Facebook have become gatekeepers 
that too often limit, if not outright 
squash, competition online. The result 
is unprecedented market domination 
that allows these small handful of 
giant 
companies 
to 
influence 
the 
choices and actions of literally billions 
of people every day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7710 
November 3, 2021 
Think about how many times each of 
us goes on Google. Multiply that by the 
billions every day. That is the kind of 
influence these large companies have. 
Take Amazon. Just yesterday, the 
Judiciary Committee heard from a 
small business owner who sells his 
Crazy Aaron’s Thinking Putty on Ama-
zon’s dominant online marketplace. He 
watched as Amazon leveraged its domi-
nance by using the data it collects 
from 
these 
sales 
to 
introduce 
a 
knockoff of his product. This is con-
sistent with reporting from Reuters 
and others that Amazon recruits small 
businesses to its marketplace and then 
systematically uses the seller data it 
collects to develop competing products 
and preferences those products by plac-
ing them at the top of its search re-
sults. 
Google uses similar tactics to pref-
erence its own products and services. 
The company controls over 90 percent 
of the search market—90 percent. That 
might not be such a big deal if Google 
simply fulfilled the promise of its co-
founder, Larry Page, to ‘‘get you out of 
Google and to the right place as fast as 
possible,’’ but that simply isn’t the 
case anymore. About two-thirds of 
searches on Google result in zero 
clicks; in other words, they start on 
Google, and they end on Google. That 
means, for example, that more and 
more diners looking for the best res-
taurants don’t get directed to Yelp, the 
site Google’s own search criteria iden-
tifies as best; rather, they get Google’s 
inferior reviews. It means that trav-
elers looking for travel deals on the top 
tourist attractions don’t get sent to 
Expedia or Tripadvisor; they are stuck 
with Google. This is becoming the case 
for more and more searches. 
Apple, likewise, uses its complete 
control over the iPhone and IOS oper-
ating system to give its product a leg 
up. The company has introduced a 
number of products, including Apple 
Music, AirTags, and others, to compete 
with third-party products—except it is 
really no competition at all because 
Apple pushes those third parties into 
its payment system and then charges a 
tax of up to 30 percent. Sure, con-
sumers can still use Spotify or Tile, 
but they all have to pay more to do so. 
In either case, Apple wins. 
These companies have made clear 
time and again that they are not inter-
ested in competing on a level playing 
field; instead, they are determined to 
totally control the playing field. Un-
less the Federal Government steps in, 
they will continue to do whatever it 
takes to hold on to their market domi-
nance, competition be damned. 
This isn’t good for consumers. That 
is why I cosponsored the American In-
novation and Choice Online Act. The 
bill will put an end to these abusive 
and anti-competitive practices. Among 
other 
things, 
it 
will 
outlaw 
self- 
preferencing by the dominant online 
platforms, 
prevent 
these 
platforms 
from using a competitor’s data to com-
pete against them, and ban the biasing 
of search results to benefit the com-
pany’s own products. Unlike the words 
of the big tech behemoths, the Amer-
ican Innovation and Choice Online Act 
isn’t an empty promise; it will actually 
put consumers first by restoring com-
petition in the online marketplace. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield to my colleague Senator 
BLUMENTHAL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Hawaii for 
that very powerful explanation for why 
we are here today, and I thank Senator 
KLOBUCHAR for her incredibly impor-
tant and impactful leadership in this 
area as the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Antitrust of the Judici-
ary Committee. She has led inform-
ative and profoundly significant hear-
ings, and now she has brought to the 
floor, with many of us as cosponsors, 
along with Senator GRASSLEY, this 
major piece of legislation, the Amer-
ican Innovation and Choice Online Act. 
I will just begin by restating what a 
number of my colleagues have said. 
These complaints about inflation are 
really totally misplaced as applied to 
the Build Back Better legislation. In 
fact, the Build Back Better legislation 
will drive down costs for Americans, 
make childcare affordable and acces-
sible, make preschool free and uni-
versal for all Americans, and lower the 
cost of prescription drugs—for the first 
time, a major piece of legislation to 
lower the cost of prescription drugs for 
Americans and lower costs, as well, for 
energy and housing. The ripple effects 
of these major steps in reducing costs 
for everyday Americans will be pro-
found and enduring. 
To my colleagues who say on the 
floor today that this bill is changing or 
complex, yes, it is complex because it 
is big and impactful in lowering costs. 
And, yes, we have listened to Ameri-
cans in making improvements to the 
bill, and we will continue to listen to 
Americans. 
Now, inflation also is tied to the bill 
that is before us, the American Innova-
tion and Choice Online Act. Competi-
tion is the lifeblood of our economy. 
Competition is the way that prices are 
kept competitive in benefits to con-
sumers. Competition among businesses 
is the key. 
Today, in our digital marketplaces, 
Big Tech in effect controls access to 
consumers. 
Go back to an earlier time in our 
country’s history. After the Civil War, 
we saw railroad tycoons use their mo-
nopolies to favor big, repeat businesses, 
with costs to average Americans. They 
imposed discriminatory terms on farm-
ers and other businesses that needed 
access to the rails in order to get their 
products to the public. The American 
people wanted to do something about 
it. Congress did. In 1887, Congress re-
sponded by passing the Interstate Com-
merce Act, which stopped railroad mo-
nopolies from offering less favorable 
terms to smaller businesses and farm-
ers. 
The analogy is not completely exact 
because we are dealing now with Big 
Tech, but the principle is the same. 
Think of it as the big tech companies 
controlling the means of delivery of 
goods and services. They are the mod-
ern-day railroads. In our digital mar-
kets, they are dominant gatekeepers 
with total control of essential online 
platforms. But, even worse, they have 
another role as marketers of their own 
products on those platforms. In other 
words, big tech companies own the rail-
roads of our digital economy, but they 
also compete with the economies rely-
ing on those railroads to get their 
products to consumers. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, in the 
Commerce 
Committee, 
the 
Sub-
committee on Consumer Protection, 
which I chair, a whistleblower from 
Facebook described, to the disgust and 
dismay of most Americans, how Big 
Tech is pushing disruptive and toxic 
content on children and how they know 
it and profit from it and, in fact, know 
from their own research and studies 
what the effects are of online bullying 
and eating disorders and other harms 
that are conveyed. 
Americans asked me, as they did 
many of my colleagues: What are you 
going to do about it? 
There are solutions—on privacy, on 
tools for parents, on other means of 
holding Big Tech accountable—and one 
of them is to make sure that antitrust 
laws are enforced and approved so that 
there are competing apps that offer 
safer means of reaching children and 
other consumers. 
Now, the app market is a place where 
these harms to consumers and competi-
tion are starker than anywhere else. 
The mobile app market has grown into 
a significant part of the digital econ-
omy. In 2020 alone, U.S. consumers 
spent nearly $33 billion in mobile app 
stores, downloading 13.4 billion apps. 
We are all dependent on our phones 
as our gateway to our work, our social 
lives, and education. But two compa-
nies, Apple and Google, dictate the 
terms of this important market. They 
do it exclusively. Yet they have those 
dual roles: first as gatekeepers of the 
dominant mobile operating systems 
and their app stores; and, second, as 
participants on those app stores. 
And as with the railroad tycoons, 
Apple and Google abuse that gate-
keeper status to preference themselves 
and their business partners, driving up 
their 
own 
profits—and 
consumers’ 
costs—while shutting down competi-
tion and stifling innovation. Higher 
costs, less innovation means consumers 
are deprived of the benefits of competi-
tion. 
As with the railroads, Congress needs 
to ensure that new entrants and small-
er companies can compete on fair 
terms. Today’s digital tycoons need 
new rules of the road that will protect 
other businesses, like laws protected 
small farmers and small businesses

S7711 
November 3, 2021 
against the railroad tycoons. And these 
rules of the road need to address the 
anti-competitive discrimination that is 
self-preferencing across our app econ-
omy. 
I have heard from app developers who 
have been unable to tell their own cus-
tomers about lower prices, unable to 
inform their own customers about bet-
ter prices from app developers whose 
ideas have been co-opted by Apple and 
Google under their ‘‘kill’’ or ‘‘copy’’ 
strategy and who are knee-capped by 
the onerous 30-percent rent fees that 
are charged to them. And if app devel-
opers don’t like the term, there is sim-
ply nowhere else for them to go. 
So I am indebted to Senator KLO-
BUCHAR and Senator BLACKBURN for co-
authoring another bill with me. In Au-
gust, I was proud to introduce the Open 
App Markets Act, which would address 
anti-competitive 
discrimination 
and 
self-preferencing. 
I believe that it is critical that we 
pass that bill, as well as this one, to set 
fair, clear, and enforceable rules to 
protect competition and consumers 
within the app market. 
Like in the app market, there are 
central gatekeepers in our digital mar-
kets with enormous power and deep 
conflicts of interest. Amazon alone, for 
example, controls as much as 70 per-
cent of all United States online mar-
ketplace sales. If you are a third-party 
business: Amazon can stop you from 
contacting your own consumers; Ama-
zon can rank its own products ahead of 
you in search; Amazon can make sure 
that when a consumer asks Alexa to 
buy a particular product, the consumer 
receives Amazon products; Amazon can 
use its asymmetric access to data to 
engage in a copy and kill strategy. It 
can replicate your successful products, 
make the products themselves—often 
more cheaply, given their massive 
size—and then rank the product at the 
top of the search bar. In effect, they 
can make it impossible for you to com-
pete on product quality or price. 
We have a rare opportunity to im-
prove this abuse of power. We should 
seize that opportunity with bipartisan 
support and help protect American 
consumers and businesses. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that I be per-
mitted to speak up to 7 minutes; Sen-
ator MERKLEY, up to 15 minutes; and 
Senator DURBIN, up to 10 minutes prior 
to the scheduled votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I want to thank my colleague Senator 
GRASSLEY, the Republican lead on this 
bill; Senator BLUMENTHAL, who has 
done so much work in the area of com-
petition and protection of children; and 
Senator HIRONO, who came to the floor 
today; as well as our original cospon-
sors of this bill, with many more sup-
porters out there. And that includes 
Senator DURBIN, the Chair of the Judi-
ciary 
Committee; 
Senator 
LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, the former chair; Senator 
KENNEDY; Senator CORY BOOKER; Sen-
ator JOSH HAWLEY, Senator LUMMIS; 
and Senator WARNER. 
So, as we noted, as you heard the 
speakers today, this is a real-world 
problem. This isn’t something where 
the tech companies can say ‘‘just trust 
us, we’ve got this.’’ 
I think anyone who heard the whis-
tleblower a few weeks back in Com-
merce knows that is not true; or heard 
the parent I heard from last week, who 
told me that, as she tries to protect her 
kids, as she tries to find the right filter 
or to get them to stop clicking on a 
link or doing something that is going 
to expose them to bad content and bad 
accounts, she said she feels like it is a 
faucet that is on and it is overflowing 
in a sink, and she is trying to mop it 
up, and then the water just keeps com-
ing out as she goes from kid to kid to 
kid. 
I think that pretty much sums it up 
for how a lot of parents feel right now. 
And the other thing that is going on 
when you have dominant platforms and 
you don’t have enough competition and 
you can’t get competitors that might 
have developed the bells and whistles 
that would have protected us from mis-
information and from bad information 
for our kids—well, that is what hap-
pens when you have dominant plat-
forms. 
And you know what else happens to 
you when you go to search for res-
taurant reviews, you might not be able 
to see what you really want to see. In-
stead, you get pushed towards less rep-
utable and less informative reviews; or 
when you go to try to book a flight, 
you might be missing out on a better 
deal because of certain dominant plat-
forms’ own booking tool is being 
pushed to the top of your results. You 
are basically getting ripped off. That is 
it, plain and simple. 
It also means a dominant platform 
using nonpublic data—nonpublic data, 
stuff it gathered from you. And, by the 
way, one example, Facebook makes $51 
a quarter—a quarter—off of every one 
of the pages that is sitting here in 
front of us, off of Senator MERKLEY, 
who is patiently waiting to speak. 
Fifty-one dollars a quarter is how 
much they make because they have got 
access to all this information, and then 
the ads get targeted to us. And we 
don’t get any of that money. 
Dominant platforms, using nonpublic 
data that they gather from small busi-
nesses can use their platforms—and 
this is in the retail space; we are talk-
ing 
here, 
like, 
Amazon—to 
build 
knockoff copies of their products and 
then compete against the people who 
we are paying to advertise on their 
platform. 
This isn’t your local grocery store 
chain selling store brand potato chips 
to compete with a brand-name product. 
This is Amazon using incredibly de-
tailed, nonpublic information that they 
get from their sellers on their platform 
to create copycat products and box out 
competition from small innovators. 
What does it look like? 
In one case, an employee of Amazon’s 
private label arm accessed a detailed 
sales report with 25 columns of infor-
mation on a car trunk organizer pro-
duced by a small Brooklyn company 
called Fortem. In October 2019, Amazon 
started selling three trunk organizers 
of its own. When shown the collection 
data Amazon had gathered about his 
brand before launching of their own 
product, Fortem’s cofounder called it a 
big surprise. 
Yeah, I don’t think most of us as-
sume that trillion-dollar companies 
put their troves of data to work boxing 
small businesses out of the trunk orga-
nizer market. But it happened. 
That is why we are here supporting 
the American Innovation and Choice 
Online Act. 
Yeah, you have got to update your 
competition laws when they haven’t 
been changed since the internet was in-
vented. 
What does this mean? 
Apple won’t be able to stifle competi-
tion by blocking other companies’ serv-
ices from interoperating with their 
platform. Amazon won’t be able to mis-
use small businesses’ data in order to 
copy their products. And Google won’t 
be able to bias their platform’s search 
results in favor of other products— 
their own products. 
The result? 
A fairer playing field for small and 
medium businesses, more options, more 
flexibility, and more access to markets 
and fostering entrepreneurship for the 
new kids on the block. 
And, by the way, as Senator GRASS-
LEY outlined, this bill does not outlaw 
Amazon Prime. Let’s go for the lie. It 
does not do that. That is what they 
have been saying because they want to 
stop this in its tracks; or free shipping; 
or stop Apple from freeloading useful 
apps onto their iPhones. No, no, no. 
This is the kind of stuff they have been 
saying for a while. 
And that is why Senator GRASSLEY 
and I spent the entire summer working 
on this bill, to make sure it did none of 
that. That is why we have such broad 
support, because this is targeted at 
anti-competitive conduct. 
We are really excited about this bill. 
The positive opinions it has been get-
ting—Boston Globe, Washington Post: 
‘‘Finally a promising piece of tech 
antitrust legislation in Congress.’’ 
I think there are other ones, but that 
is what they said in there. 
So commonsense rules of the road for 
major digital platforms, allowing them 
to continue to operate their businesses. 
We are glad for these products. We like 
these products. We want to keep these 
companies strong. But they don’t need 
to engage in this kind of behavior. 
That is why we are here today, and we 
are looking very forward to getting 
this bill before the Judiciary Com-
mittee and passed through the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7712 
November 3, 2021 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
not too long ago, we had a vote on 
whether or not to start a debate on the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And the 
majority said, yes, start the debate. 
Then why aren’t we here in that de-
bate? 
Well, the simple answer is we have a 
process whereby you have to have 60— 
a supermajority of the Senate decide to 
start a debate. In other words, there is 
ability to exercise a veto over whether 
or not a bill is worthy for consider-
ation on this floor, even if it is sup-
ported by the majority of legislators. 
That effort is really about destroying 
the ability of this Senate to address 
the big issues facing America. 
What bigger issue is there in a Re-
public than stopping billionaires from 
buying 
elections; 
to 
stop 
gerry-
mandering from destroying equal rep-
resentation; to stop State laws that 
create prejudicial barriers designed to 
target specific groups to keep them 
from voting; barriers at the ballot box 
to steal the right to vote? What bigger, 
more fundamental issues are there 
than that? 
Yet we can’t even start a debate. In 
fact, we spend a lot of time debating 
whether to debate, and that is wasted 
time on the floor. 
So, truly, that vote we took was sym-
bolic of two things. The first is that we 
are failing to address one of the biggest 
issues we face in this Nation: the integ-
rity of our election system, the corrup-
tion of our election system. 
And, second, that this Senate has be-
come dysfunctional. 
When Ben Franklin was walking out 
of the Constitutional Convention, he 
was asked by a woman what kind of 
government they had created—a Mon-
archy or a Republic? And he is reported 
to have responded: A Republic, if you 
can keep it. 
We have strived through 234 years to 
keep 
that 
Republic 
through 
war, 
through depression, through social un-
rest, through global pandemic. We 
fought for 234 years to ensure that, as 
expressed by Lincoln at Gettysburg, 
‘‘government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.’’ But, as the American 
philosopher John Dewey once said, 
‘‘Democracy has to be born anew every 
generation.’’ 
It is up to each generation to take up 
the cause and fight to protect the foun-
dations of our Republic. We are facing 
a moment of crisis once again when 
this institution has veered far afield 
from that time when it was declared to 
be the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Now it is perhaps the world’s 
most dysfunctional legislative body— 
unwilling and unable to even debate, 
let alone vote, on the biggest issue of 
our time: the defense of our Republic 
from the corrupting forces of power, of 
billionaires buying elections, of gerry-
mandering, and certainly of barriers at 
the ballot box. 
So we have a responsibility to take 
up this cause, to understand its source, 
and to address it, to restore the Senate 
as a deliberative body. 
One of the ways to evaluate our dys-
function is to look at the trend and 
number of amendments considered on 
the U.S. Senate floor. 
In the 109th session of Congress, 2005 
to 2007, there were 314 amendments. In 
the 116th, the 2 years just passed, there 
were 26. So 314 amendments to 26. And 
most of the amendments that were al-
lowed of those 26 went to just 2 Mem-
bers, so most Members had no oppor-
tunity to offer amendments. 
The trends in cloture filings—that is 
a motion to close debate—give us some 
understanding of what has happened. 
They were extremely rare in the past 
because the Senate understood it was a 
simple majority body. That is the way 
the Founders designed it. So very rare-
ly there had to be an effort to actually 
close debate because Members went on 
forever speaking, but it was rare—in 
1910 through 1919, just three times; in 
1930 through 1940, four times; and in 
1950 to 1960, two times. But then, in 
1970 forward, things changed. From 1970 
to 1975, there were 57 filings to close 
debate in 4 years versus 34 from 1910 
forward to 1970. 
This explosion—and that was just on 
policy legislation—led to a reform in 
1975. The rule for closing debate—the 
old rule of two-thirds of Senators vot-
ing was changed to three-fifths of Sen-
ators duly chosen or sworn. That is 60 
votes regardless of how many people 
were on the floor voting. 
That rule change was started, if you 
will—generated just in those years 
from 1970 to 1974 where you had these 
57 cloture motions, which is nothing 
compared to today—nothing—which I 
will expand on. 
But that 1975 rule change—because 
instead of saying it was a percentage of 
those present and voting, instead, it 
was a percentage of the Senate, it 
means that, unwittingly, we trans-
formed the way that you delay things 
in order to exercise leverage. 
We had, under the old rule, a public 
process where you had to take the floor 
as I am right now and speak at length 
in order to delay while your teammates 
worked to negotiate an amendment, 
negotiate a compromise, make sure the 
public had read the bill, make sure the 
press had seen the bill, make sure the 
Senators had vetted the bill. All those 
are valuable. That delay in order to im-
prove the process is valuable. 
Under the old rule, it was a public 
process. The whole Nation saw it, and 
they could judge whether you were a 
champion or whether you were a dis-
aster, and you got that feedback. 
Under that old rule, it was not just a 
public process, but it took enormous 
energy. 
Under the new rule—a no-show. It is 
not necessary to show up for debate 
and not necessary to show up to vote. 
It is a no-show, no-effort veto that 
transformed this Senate. Well, the re-
sult was that it made it so easy to ob-
struct that people decided to obstruct a 
lot. That 1975 cloture rule backfired by 
creating this no-show, no-effort ob-
struction. 
Let me give you a sense of this. Dur-
ing the period 1960 through 1970, there 
were some 25 cloture motions to close 
debate, but in the next decade, over 100 
in the seventies; in the eighties, over 
200; in the nineties, over 300; in the 
2000s, over 400; and in 2010 through 2020, 
1,029 motions to close debate. That is 
the disaster we are living in right now. 
Instead of it just being ‘‘Let’s slow 
things down on final passage,’’ it be-
came ‘‘Let’s slow things down on 
amendments.’’ So we went from zero 
cloture motions on amendments from 
1920 through 1960 to 143 just in one 10- 
year period. It expanded to nomina-
tions. We went from zero from 1910 
through 1960 to 545 during 2010 through 
2020. In motions to proceed to legisla-
tion, we went from zero during the fif-
ties to 175 in 2010. 
So this process of a supermajority 
vote to proceed expanded from being 
rare to being common. It expanded 
from being on final passage of legisla-
tion to everything—amendments, mo-
tions to proceed—every aspect of the 
work we do here. 
Now, here is the very strange thing: 
This use of a supermajority would ab-
solutely have astounded and appalled 
our Founders. Our Founders were oper-
ating under the Confederation Congress 
at the time they were writing the Con-
stitution. The Confederation Congress 
had a requirement for a supermajority, 
and that supermajority paralyzed the 
Confederation Congress. They were not 
able to raise an army to put down 
Shays’ Rebellion. They were not able 
to raise money to pay for the Revolu-
tionary War veterans. 
So our Founders said: Whatever you 
do, don’t adopt a supermajority. 
We have Hamilton writing: 
If two thirds of the whole number of mem-
bers had been required . . . the history of 
every political establishment in which this 
principle has prevailed, is a history of impo-
tence, perplexity, and disorder. 
Hamilton, 
in 
another 
Federalist 
paper, wrote: 
If a pertinacious minority can control . . . 
[the] majority . . . tedious delays; continual 
negotiation and intrigue; contemptible com-
promises of the public good [will result]. 
Then we have Madison, who said: 
In all cases where justice or the general 
good might require new laws . . . or active 
measures . . . the fundamental principle of 
free government would be reversed [under a 
supermajority]. It would be no longer the 
majority that would rule: the power would 
be transferred to the minority. 
He is pointing out that it stands the 
very structure of a legislative body on 
its head. 
He went on to note that the result of 
the 
supermajority—remember, 
they 
were experiencing this under the Con-
federation Congress—is to produce the

following: that the ‘‘minority might 
take advantage of it to screen them-
selves from equitable sacrifices to the 
general weal, or, in particular emer-
gencies, to extort unreasonable indul-
gences.’’ 
Here, are our Founders saying: We 
experienced the supermajority. Don’t 
ever do it. 
They wrote the Constitution so a 
supermajority was reserved only for 
special circumstances, like evicting 
Members, like considering a treaty, 
like overruling a Presidential veto. 
So why are we here today doing ex-
actly what the Founders said not to do 
and experiencing exactly the results 
that they had experienced under the 
Confederation Congress? 
My friends, we have a responsibility 
to restore the function of this body. We 
need to streamline the nomination 
process. Think about how a nomination 
works. You vote to go to executive ses-
sion. You have a motion to proceed to 
a nomination. You vote on proceeding. 
You hold a debate, you hold a vote, and 
then you proceed it, and then you hold 
a debate, and then you vote, and then 
you have 2 hours of postdebate, and 
then finally a vote. That is a crazy sys-
tem to be able to consider a nomina-
tion. It takes up huge amounts of our 
time when a simple vote to proceed, 
limited debate, simple vote to proceed 
to on the floor, simple time to consider 
it, and a vote on whether or not you 
are going to allow the person to fill the 
position the person has been nominated 
for—this sort of streamlining would 
save us all a tremendous amount of 
time that could be dedicated to actual 
debate and actual amendments. 
Then there is this use of a super-
majority on motions to proceed to leg-
islation, using a blockade to prevent 
debate, not to facilitate debate, as is 
sometimes 
argued 
for 
the 
super-
majority—that 
it 
can 
slow 
things 
down, facilitate debate, make sure bills 
are read, make sure there is a chance 
of negotiation—no, to prevent debate. 
We shouldn’t spend time debating 
whether to debate. Let’s just have a set 
hour to consider whether to move to a 
bill, and then we either move to it or 
we don’t. 
How about amendments? I noted the 
collapse of the ability of Senators to 
amend. Senators in the minority want 
to do amendments. Senators in the ma-
jority want to do amendments. We all 
have ideas and thoughts on how to 
change things and improve things. We 
want to make our case, but we don’t 
get to do it here anymore. 
Don’t we have a bipartisan, vested in-
terest in restoring amendments to the 
deliberations of the Senate? You know, 
I was pondering this question because 
we seem to be locked in a cycle where, 
given partisan differences in the Na-
tion—partisan differences that are in-
creased by social media and increased 
by cable television—we just can’t seem 
to come together to be able to make 
this place work as it is supposed to, as 
it is our responsibility to do. But we 
have gotten to the point where we are 
utterly—utterly—damaging the United 
States of America. 
You know, the President of China, 
President Xi, is saying: Hey, there is a 
world competition between democratic 
republics and an authoritarian world. 
Look what we have done in China. We 
went from bicycles, and then we had 
cars and traffic jams, and now we have 
bullet trains, 16,000-mile bullet trains. 
Look what we are accomplishing. Look 
how many millions are lifted out of 
poverty. 
Look 
how 
paralyzed 
the 
United States is. 
Why is the United States paralyzed? 
Because this Chamber cannot discuss a 
simple debate and vote like every 
State legislature across this country 
does. 
Colleagues, let’s come together. Let’s 
restore debate. Let’s restore amend-
ments. Let’s save and savor and im-
prove the ability of the minority to 
participate in the process, but let’s 
also remember that balance of the Sen-
ate involves getting to a final decision, 
a simple majority vote as the Founders 
had intended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER SUNG 
Mr. DURBIN. The Senate will soon be 
voting on a highly qualified nominee to 
the Ninth Circuit, Jennifer Sung. 
She is a distinguished jurist who will 
bring an underrepresented perspective 
to the bench. She is a graduate of 
Oberlin and Yale Law School. She 
clerked for Judge Betty Binns Fletcher 
on the Ninth Circuit. She received a 
prestigious Skadden Fellowship and 
worked on economic legal issues at the 
Brennan Center. She spent more than a 
decade representing American workers, 
often minorities from low-income and 
underserved communities, in labor dis-
putes. 
In 2017, Oregon Governor Kate Brown 
appointed her to serve on the Oregon 
Employment Relations Board, known 
as the ERB. It is a three-member, 
quasi-judicial agency charged with re-
solving labor disputes. As a member of 
that board, she sits on a three-member 
panel that reviews evidentiary records, 
independently evaluates the law, and 
works in a collaborative manner to 
reach consensus on opinions and issues. 
If that sounds like the same process 
she would follow in Federal court, it is. 
In her nearly 5 years on that board, she 
has presided over more than 200 mat-
ters, and only 3 of the 200 have ever 
been overturned. 
She has exhibited the kinds of quali-
ties we expect of a circuit court nomi-
nee. She has been criticized for one 
thing that she did in her life, and some 
of her critics won’t forget it. She 
signed a letter that was opposed to 
Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the 
Supreme Court. She has testified under 
oath before our committee that some 
statements in that letter were, in fact, 
overheated. More importantly, she tes-
tified that she respects the authority 
of all members of the Supreme Court 
and recognizes the importance of faith-
fully following law and precedent. 
The best evidence of how she will 
serve on the circuit is her impressive 
record in the State of Oregon. When 
you look at that record, you see that 
she has the support not only of many 
colleagues 
but 
also 
of 
employees, 
unions, and employers. Here is what 
they said: ‘‘impressive intelligence, 
diligent preparation, respectful court-
room demeanor, and judicial impar-
tiality.’’ How about that for a check-
list for a judgeship? 
When I hear some of my colleagues 
express outrage over one letter she 
signed in her life, I wonder if they re-
member some of the nominees that 
they brought before us in the last 4 
years. It appears there is a double 
standard. 
Ms. Sung has the strong support of 
Senators MERKLEY and WYDEN, and the 
American Bar Association rated her as 
‘‘well qualified.’’ As the first Asian- 
American woman—she will be the first 
to hold the Oregon seat in the Ninth 
Circuit, bringing diversity to that 
bench. Her professional accomplish-
ments and her commitment to fairness 
and impartiality are profound and im-
pressive. 
I support her, and I hope my col-
leagues will as well. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
we adjourn this evening, in a few mo-
ments, I will move to confirm Mr. Tom 
Nides as the next Ambassador to Israel. 
I am glad the Republican hold on Mr. 
Nides has been lifted, and we will have 
an Ambassador in Israel to help main-
tain and strengthen the U.S.-Israel re-
lationship. 
Mr. Nides, as I have known him for 
many years, is just the right fit. He is 
a hard-working man. He is a bright 
man. He has tremendous experience, 
and 
he 
cares 
very 
much 
about 
strengthening the U.S.-Israel relation-
ship. So this will be a good day for that 
relationship because we are going to 
confirm him very, very shortly. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING CAROLYN POLLAN 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor Carolyn Pollan, who 
passed away at the age of 84 on Satur-
day, October 23, 2021. 
Carolyn Pollan was a native of Fort 
Smith, AR, who dedicated her life to 
serving the Natural State. She was 
elected to the Arkansas House of Rep-
resentatives in 1975 and was one of only 
three women serving in the State legis-
lature at the time. She served until 
1999, becoming the longest serving 
woman and Republican in Arkansas 
House history. 
Throughout her career, Carolyn was 
a champion of Arkansas’ families and 
children. Her leadership in developing 
policies to help kids and families land-
ed her in more positions to create posi-
tive change for future generations. 
She created and chaired the children 
and youth committee—a new com-
mittee specifically designed to address 
problems 
affecting 
children—and 
served on the education committee and 
legislative council, as well as the joint 
budget committee. In addition, she 
formed the first domestic abuse hotline 
and established the Arkansas Commis-
sion on Child Abuse, Rape, and Domes-
tic Abuse. She also crafted legislation 
that brought about major, positive 
changes to teaching at-risk youth. 
Over 250 pieces of legislation she spon-
sored were passed, many of them posi-
tively impacting Arkansas’s families 
and children. Family, friends, and col-
leagues say no one came close to 
matching her passion on these issues. 
Additionally, Carolyn was the first 
woman appointed as associate speaker 
pro tempore of the State House. 
Carolyn also cared deeply about edu-
cation. For 25 years, she served on the 
John Brown University Board of Trust-
ees—the first woman to do so—and be-
came a Trustee Emeritus. She also cre-
ated the Pygmalion Commission in 
1993, which continues to improve edu-
cational outcomes for at-risk students 
in Arkansas. Additionally, she served 
on numerous educational boards and 
committees. 
Carolyn 
chaired 
the 
Southern Regional Legislative Council 
Education Committee and Southern 
Legislative Council Education Com-
mittee, served in the Office of Tech-
nology Assessment of the Congress Ad-
visory Board for the National Study of 
Computers in Education, and on sev-
eral educational boards within the U.S. 
Department of Education and U.S. De-
partment of Labor. 
Carolyn also worked for Arkansas 
Governor Mike Huckabee for 3 years, 
where she helped enact welfare and 
workplace reforms and managed the 
State’s 
multimillion-dollar 
tobacco 
settlement. She served on the develop-
ment committee of the Clinton School 
of Public Service and was a founder 
and board president of the Arkansas 
Center for Health Improvement within 
the University of Arkansas for Medical 
Sciences, which has significantly im-
proved the health of Arkansans since 
its founding. 
She has been honored by numerous 
organizations in recognition of her ac-
complishments. Carolyn was included 
in the Top 100 Women in Arkansas by 
Arkansas Business Magazine and was 
honored as one of 10 outstanding legis-
lators in the U.S. by the National As-
sembly of Government. She was also 
named among the top 100 most influen-
tial people in Arkansas according to a 
statewide poll conducted by the Associ-
ated Press. In 2020, she was inducted 
into the Arkansas Women’s Hall of 
Fame. 
With such an impressive background 
and career, Carolyn remained humble 
and never lost sight of the reason she 
served: to protect Arkansas’s vulner-
able families and children and create 
greater 
future 
opportunities 
that 
would not only benefit them tremen-
dously but also benefit the state. She 
was well-respected by colleagues across 
the aisle who attested to her willing-
ness to work together if it meant im-
proving the lives of Arkansans. 
Carolyn Pollan’s relentless advocacy 
and passion created a far better, safer, 
and healthier Arkansas for families 
and children that boasts more access to 
important educational opportunities. I 
am honored to recognize her incredible 
life and join with her loved ones, 
former colleagues, and community in 
celebrating Carolyn’s legacy.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARK JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I con-
gratulate KTVB News anchor and jour-
nalist, Mark Johnson, on his remark-
able career, as he retires after 40 years 
in the television news business. 
Mark’s dedicated career started in 
television sports in Missouri in 1981, 
brought him to Idaho, then took him 
to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania before, 
thankfully, bringing him back home to 
Idaho and KTVB in 1996. He served as 
KTVB’s sports director before his 2003 
promotion to serve as the station’s 
main anchor. He is well-described by 
the station as, ‘‘A constant in the lives 
of generations of Idaho families, Mark 
Johnson has watched 30 years of Idaho 
history unfold from his spot in the 
KTVB studio.’’ 
He has understandably earned signifi-
cant recognitions for his work. This in-
cludes KTVB earning regional Emmy 
awards for the News at 10 while Mark 
was a pivotal part of the team as lead 
anchor and his winning of a national 
Edward R. Murrow award for his work 
involving the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics. 
In addition to the time and talent he 
has committed to reporting, he has 
also supported many community ef-
forts. 
His heartfelt appreciation for and 
deep interest in the people of Idaho and 
its valued spaces are reflected in his 
thoughtful journalism. Those who have 
had the opportunity to work with Mark 
and know him consider themselves 
lucky. His calm demeanor during chal-
lenges and his sense of humor have 
shaped the way many have faced the 
events that are part of daily life, and it 
is clear he will be greatly missed in the 
anchor chair. 
Mark, as you start your next chapter, 
I wish you more, well-earned time with 
your many friends and loved ones, in-
cluding your wife Chris; daughters 
Hannah, Lindsey, Alexa, and Grace; 
and grandson. I congratulate you on an 
amazing career and thank you for 
bringing Idahoans the news for all 
these years.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7716 
November 3, 2021 
the years through his compelling cor-
respondence. Bill Stokes is an artist, a 
man of deep thought and many talents. 
Among his many traits and skills, he 
does incredible woodworking and water 
systems, and he is an author and a 
poet. In honor of Veterans Day, Bill 
has asked me to submit two of his 
poems to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
The first poem is entitled ‘‘Tears.’’ 
I have pondered long and hard for more than 
fifty years. 
And it is my belief that the two most impor-
tant gifts you will ever know are life 
and freedom because the price of both 
is a Mother’s tears. 
Both require an entire lifetime of hard hard 
work. 
And you cannot, dare not, avoid and shirk. 
Birth is the hardest work a mother will ever 
do. 
And freedom also requires an excruciatingly 
painful birth with unending protection 
from both me and you. 
Make no mistake that freedom comes at 
great cost of life. 
Because tyrants are as thieves that are to-
tally committed to stealing your free-
dom with a bloody knife. 
The description is exactly real. 
Because if you don’t aggressively protect 
your freedom, the knife you will feel. 
Freedom absolutely requires an honest gov-
ernment with a standing army of those 
unafraid to die. 
To ensure that every future generation has 
the ability to follow its dreams to the 
far edge of the sky. 
Falling in battle is clearly the Soldier’s lot. 
But that is how the freedom you enjoy is 
bought. 
Those fallen in battle cannot ever become 
nameless and lost. 
And regardless of culture or clime, a na-
tional day of remembrance, ensures 
that every warrior’s name is with 
honor, remembered, that they paid for 
your freedom’s cost. 
I have pondered long and hard for more than 
fifty years. 
And it is my belief that the two most impor-
tant gifts you will ever know are life 
and freedom because the price of both 
is a Mother’s tears. 
The second poem is called ‘‘Son.’’ 
As I walked by a young man was standing in 
front of his home wearing his desert 
camouflage waiting for his ride and as 
I walked up to him he cradled his gun. 
And I couldn’t help myself from asking 
‘‘What’s your name son?’’ 
I did not understand why he stood there 
alone when I heard his mother’s wails 
of despair as she cried. 
And his father’s voice cracking as he tried to 
comfort her from the house somewhere 
inside. 
His eyes were red from his own tears as he to 
his family he had said his goodbye. 
And everyone knowing full well that this 
might be the last time they see him 
alive from fighting in a war he did not 
contrive. 
I told him that as a father and a vet. 
How proud I was and his name was indelible 
in my mind and I would never forget. 
As I only came this way every month or so 
I would look and see. 
That upon his return if he tied a bright red 
ribbon on a branch of the front yard 
tree. 
Before I left I came to full attention and sa-
luted him with all the honor he was 
due. 
And with a calm determination looking 
straight into my eyes, he returned the 
salute understanding exactly what we 
both already knew. 
I made many trips walking by that house 
looking for a ribbon to let me know he 
was back. 
And just about a year later there was a rib-
bon tied to the tree but it wasn’t red, 
it was black. 
As I walked by a young man standing in 
front of his home wearing his desert 
camouflage waiting for his ride and as 
I walked up to him he cradled his gun. 
And I couldn’t help myself from asking 
‘‘What’s your name son?’’ 
Thank you, Bill, for your incredible 
tribute to our veterans, just as we pre-
pare to mark Veterans Day in 2021 and 
honor the sacrifices they make on our 
behalf.∑

REMEMBERING JOVITA MOORE 
∑ Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, the 
State of Georgia is mourning legendary 
broadcast 
journalist 
Jovita 
Moore. 
Jovita was a trailblazer, a great jour-
nalist, and an Atlanta icon. She began 
her career in journalism in Memphis, 
TN, and Fayetteville, AR, before join-
ing WSB-TV in Atlanta in 1998. She be-
came a full-time anchor at WSB-TV in 
2012, delivering Atlantans the news 
each afternoon and holding the power-
ful to account. 
Born in New York, Jovita earned a 
bachelor 
of 
arts 
degree 
from 
Bennington College in Bennington, VT, 
before earning a master of science de-
gree in broadcast journalism from Co-
lumbia University’s Graduate School of 
Journalism in New York City. 
Jovita’s career helped blaze the trail 
for other women and those from di-
verse backgrounds in journalism. She 
was a member of the Atlanta Associa-
tion of Black Journalists and the Na-
tional Association of Black Journalists 
and 
won 
multiple 
Emmy 
awards 
throughout her time at WSB-TV. Her 
excellence and example have undoubt-
edly inspired countless others to follow 
in her footsteps. In 2017, Jovita was in-
ducted into The National Academy of 
Television Arts & Sciences Southeast 
Chapter’s Silver Circle, one of its most 
prestigious career awards. 
Jovita gave back to the community, 
taking time out of her busy schedule to 
mentor others and help them realize 
their true potential. She and her fam-
ily would help deliver meals during the 
holidays, demonstrating commitment 
to helping those in need. 
Jovita’s spirit, optimism, and kind-
ness radiated in everything she did. 
When she was diagnosed with glio-
blastoma earlier this year, the city of 
Atlanta and the entire Nation rallied 
around Jovita, just as she had for them 
throughout her career. She never gave 
up hope, using her diagnosis to spread 
awareness and encourage others to 
visit the doctor, stay vigilant, and get 
regular screenings. Jovita put her com-
munity first. Jovita Moore was a lov-
ing mother, daughter, and friend. She 
said her children were her life’s most 
important accomplishments. 
I thank my colleagues in the U.S. 
Senate for joining me in honoring the 
life and legacy of Jovita Moore and 
sending our deepest condolences to her 
children—Lauren, Shelby, and Josh-
ua—to her mother, family, and friends 
and the entire WSB-TV family. May 
her memory be a blessing.∑

RECOGNIZING 
COMMUNITY 
HEALTH 
CENTERS 
OF 
BUR-
LINGTON 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the Community 
Health Centers of Burlington for 50 
years of extraordinary service. 
Today, the Community Health Cen-
ters of Burlington—CHCB—is the sec-
ond largest federally qualified health 
center—FQHC—in 
Vermont, 
serving 
over 30,000 patients at eight locations. 
Fifty years ago, when they opened 
their doors in 1971 as the People’s Free 
Clinic in a small storefront in Bur-
lington’s Old North End, the center was 
run by volunteers and served just 50 pa-
tients each week. And while they have 
grown tremendously since those early 
days, CHCB has maintained a commit-
ment to what the founders of the clinic 
at the time described as ‘‘a new kind of 
health care,’’ rooted in the under-
standing that people from all walks of 
life deserves high quality, affordable 
healthcare. 
In 1989, CHCB was designated as a 
federal Healthcare for the Homeless 
site and, in 1993, officially became an 
FQHC. 
Becoming 
an 
FQHC 
meant 
CHCB was able to access important 
grants from the Federal Government, 
improvement reimbursement rate for 
care, and offer a sliding fee scale, so no 
one would be turned away because they 
could not afford the care they needed. 
But let me be clear: Health centers like 
CHCB are not exclusively for those who 
have nowhere else to go. For many peo-
ple living in the Burlington area and 
across Vermont, community health 
centers like CHCB are the provider of 
choice because they provide timely ac-
cess to high-quality care in commu-
nity-centered clinics. In fact, today, 
approximately one-third of all CHCB 
patients are covered by private health 
insurance. Another reason that FQHCs 
are so popular and used by so many 
people in Vermont and across the coun-
try is that they also offer dental care. 
CHCB first added dental services into 
its main site in 2004, and today, 7000 pa-
tients receive dental care at one of 
three CHCB locations. Further, in addi-
tion to offering primary care and oral 
healthcare, FQHCs also offer mental 
healthcare and substance use disorder 
treatment, as well as low-cost prescrip-
tion drugs. It is clear why nearly one- 
in-three Vermonters rely on FQHCs 
like CHCB for their care. 
In 2012, the Community Health Cen-
ters of Burlington was able to utilize 
funding from the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act to renovate its 
main location, known as the Riverside 
Health Center, allowing for updated pa-
tient care rooms; laboratory space; 
dental operatories; and integrated psy-
chiatry, counseling, and substance use

disorder 
treatment. 
Understanding 
that many Vermonters outside of the 
Burlington area struggled to access af-
fordable care, CHCB established a rural 
practice in the Champlain Islands. The 
health 
center 
also 
expanded 
into 
Winooski in 2017, in partnership with 
Winooski Family Health. But CHCB’s 
expansion is not simply about growing 
the number of locations. They have 
also continued to expand the services 
offered, including ensuring they can 
offer culturally competent care to the 
growing New American community. 
Today, CHCB offers translation serv-
ices to over 45 languages at their sites, 
making care not just affordable but un-
derstandable to all who need it. 
The Community Health Centers of 
Burlington is an excellent example of 
why federally qualified health centers 
are so important. To my mind, there is 
no question that healthcare is a human 
right and health centers like CHCB 
play an enormously important role in 
making sure that no one is denied care 
because of their income. That is why I 
have continually fought to protect and 
expand Federal funding for community 
health centers throughout my time in 
Congress. I am proud that during the 
negotiations of the Affordable Care 
Act, I was successful in securing man-
datory funding for these health cen-
ters, knowing that they would be bet-
ter served by knowing that they could 
rely on funding for the Federal Govern-
ment for years to come. I have contin-
ued to fight for funding for FHQCs dur-
ing the response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, knowing how critical they are 
to keeping patients healthy and con-
nected to their communities during 
these extremely challenging times. I 
am grateful to all of my colleagues 
here in the Senate and in the House of 
Representatives who have joined me in 
this effort throughout the years. 
To the staff of CHCB, I want to say 
that I know that your hard work and 
dedication is at the heart of CHCB’s 
success. I know it is not always easy to 
work in primary care, and I am grate-
ful for your efforts. And to the patients 
who rely on CHCB each year, know 
that I am glad you have entrusted your 
care to them and that I will do every-
thing in my power to ensure they are 
there to care for you for decades to 
come. And as you take time to cele-
brate your many successes over the 
past 50 years, I know you are also look-
ing toward the opportunities and chal-
lenges that lay ahead for the future. I 
look forward to continuing to work 
with you to tackle the challenges, like 
further expanding access and care, re-
ducing costs, and recruiting and retain-
ing a talented workforce dedicated to 
primary care. I will also stand with 
you as you find new opportunities for 
success and growth. While the issues 
we face are enormous, I know that 
community health centers like CHCB 
are a key to solving them. 
I sincerely congratulate the entire 
Community Health Centers of Bur-
lington family on this momentous oc-
casion and wish you another 50 years of 
delivering compassionate, professional, 
and innovative healthcare services to 
your fellow Vermonters.∑

of South

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 437 
Whereas November 8 is the anniversary of 
the signing of the Higher Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) by President Lyn-
don B. Johnson on November 8, 1965; 
Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 
(20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) was focused on in-
creasing postsecondary access and success 
for students, particularly for low-income and 
first-generation students; 
Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 
(20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) helped usher in pro-
grams necessary for postsecondary access, 
retention, and completion for low-income, 
first-generation college students, including 
the Federal TRIO Programs under chapter 1 
of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the High-
er Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a–11 et 
seq.) and the Federal Pell Grant program 
under section 401 of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a); 
Whereas the Federal TRIO Programs under 
chapter 1 of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1070a–11 et seq.) are— 
(1) the primary national effort supporting 
underrepresented students in postsecondary 
education; and 
(2) designed to identify individuals from 
low-income, first-generation backgrounds in 
order to— 
(A) prepare them for postsecondary edu-
cation; 
(B) provide them with support services; 
and 
(C) motivate and prepare them for doctoral 
programs; 
Whereas the Federal Pell Grant program 
under section 401 of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) is the primary 
Federal investment in financial aid for low- 
income college students, and is used by stu-
dents at institutions of higher education of 
their choice; 
Whereas ‘‘first-generation college student’’ 
means— 
(1) an individual whose parents did not 
complete a baccalaureate degree; or 
(2) in the case of an individual who regu-
larly resided with and received support from 
only 1 parent, an individual whose parent did 
not complete a baccalaureate degree; 
Whereas first-generation college students 
may face additional academic, financial, and 
social challenges that lead to disparate out-
comes in college access, completion, and 
labor market outcomes compared to their 
peers with parents who attended at least 
some college; 
Whereas 56 percent of all college students 
currently pursuing degrees are first-genera-
tion college students; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Council for Oppor-
tunity in Education and the Center for First- 
generation Student Success jointly launched 
the inaugural First-Generation College Cele-
bration; and 
Whereas the First-Generation College Cele-
bration has continued to grow, and institu-
tions of higher education, corporations, non-
profits, 
and 
elementary 
and 
secondary 
schools now celebrate November 8 as ‘‘Na-
tional First-Generation College Celebration 
Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
November 8, 2021, as ‘‘National First-Genera-
tion College Celebration Day’’; and 
(2) urges all people in the United States— 
(A) to celebrate National First-Generation 
College Celebration Day throughout the 
United States; 
(B) to recognize the important role that 
first-generation college students play in 
helping to develop the future workforce; and 
(C) to celebrate the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) and programs 
under that Act that help underrepresented 
students access higher education.

November 3, 2021 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 438 
Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of 
thousands of patriotic men and women, in-
cluding uranium miners, millers, and haul-
ers, plutonium producers, and onsite partici-
pants at atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, 
have served the United States by building 
nuclear weapons for the defense of the 
United States; 
Whereas dedicated workers paid a high 
price for advancing a nuclear weapons pro-
gram at the service and for the benefit of the 
United States, including by developing dis-
abling or fatal illnesses; 
Whereas the Senate recognized the con-
tributions, services, and sacrifices that those

(1) Senate Resolution 151, 111th Congress, 
agreed to May 20, 2009;

(8) Senate Resolution 560, 114th Congress,

(9) Senate Resolution 314, 115th Congress,

(10) Senate Resolution 682, 115th Congress,

(11) Senate Resolution 377, 116th Congress, 
agreed to October 30, 2019; and 
(12) Senate Resolution 741, 116th Congress, 
agreed to September 30, 2020; and 
Whereas those patriotic men and women 
deserve to be recognized for the contribu-
tions, services, and sacrifices they made for 
the defense of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 30, 2021, as a na-
tional day of remembrance for the workers 
of the nuclear weapons program of the 
United States, including the uranium min-
ers, millers, and haulers, plutonium pro-
ducers, and onsite participants at atmos-
pheric nuclear weapons tests; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to support and participate in appro-
priate ceremonies, programs, and other ac-
tivities to commemorate October 30, 2021, as 
a national day of remembrance for past and 
present workers of the nuclear weapons pro-

439—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF 
NOVEMBER 1 THROUGH NOVEM-
BER 5, 2021, AS ‘‘NATIONAL FAM-
ILY SERVICE LEARNING WEEK’’ 
Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. WICKER, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. 
BRAUN, Mr. WARNOCK, Mrs. BLACKBURN, 
Ms. WARREN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. WHITE-
HOUSE, Mr. REED, and Mr. VAN HOLLEN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 439 
Whereas family service learning is a meth-
od under which children and families learn 
and solve problems together in a multi- 
generational approach with active participa-
tion in thoughtfully organized service that— 
(1) is conducted in, and meets the needs of, 
their communities; 
(2) is focused on children and families solv-
ing community issues together; 
(3) requires the application of college and 
career readiness skills by children and rel-
evant workforce training skills by adults; 
and 
(4) is coordinated between the community 
and an elementary school, a secondary 
school, an institution of higher education, or 
a family community service program; 
Whereas family service learning— 
(1) is multi-generational learning that in-
volves parents, children, caregivers, and ex-
tended family members in shared learning 
experiences in physical and digital environ-
ments; 
(2) is integrated into and enhances the aca-
demic achievement of children or the edu-
cational components of a family service pro-
gram in which families may be enrolled; and 
(3) promotes skills (such as investigation, 
planning, and preparation), action, reflec-
tion, the demonstration of results, and sus-
tainability; 
Whereas family service learning has been 
shown to have positive multi-generational 
effects and encourages families to invest in 
their communities to improve economic and 
societal well-being; 
Whereas, through family service learning, 
children and families have the opportunity 
to solve community issues and learn to-
gether, thereby enabling the development of 
life and career skills, such as flexibility and 
adaptability, initiative and self-direction, 
social and cross-cultural skills, productivity 
and accountability, and leadership and re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas family service learning activities 
provide opportunities for families to improve 
essential skills, such as organization, re-
search, planning, reading and writing, tech-
nological literacy, teamwork, and sharing; 
Whereas families participating together in 
service are afforded quality time learning 
about their communities; 
Whereas adults engaged in family service 
learning serve as positive role models for 
their children; 
Whereas family service learning projects 
enable families to build substantive connec-
tions with their communities, develop a 
stronger sense of self-worth, experience a re-
duction in social isolation, and improve par-
enting skills; 
Whereas family service learning has added 
benefits for English learners by helping indi-
viduals and families to— 
(1) feel more connected with their commu-
nities; and 
(2) practice language skills; 
Whereas family service learning is particu-
larly important for at-risk families because 
family service learning— 
(1) provides opportunities for leadership 
and civic engagement; and 
(2) helps build the capacity to advocate for 
the needs of children and families; 
Whereas family service learning programs 
are equipped to face the unique challenges 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic 
through community engagement via video 
teleconferencing or in a socially distanced 
manner; 
Whereas family service learning will re-
main relevant throughout the pandemic as 
communities face new challenges such as 
navigating remote learning, technological 
literacy, and building and maintaining new 
relationships within communities; and 
Whereas the value that parents place on 
civic engagement and relationships within 
the community has been shown to transfer 
to children who, in turn, replicate important 
values, such as responsibility, empathy, and 
caring for others: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
November 1 through November 5, 2021, as 
‘‘National Family Service Learning Week’’ 
to raise public awareness about the impor-
tance of family service learning, family lit-
eracy, 
community 
service, 
and 
multi- 
generational learning experiences; 
(2) encourages people across the United 
States to support family service learning and 
community development programs; 
(3) recognizes the importance that family 
service learning plays in cultivating family 
literacy, civic engagement, and community 
investment; and 
(4) calls upon public, private, and nonprofit 
entities to support family service learning 
opportunities to aid in the advancement of 
families.

STATE
SPONSOR
OF
INTERNATIONAL 
CYBERCRIME..—The term ‘‘state sponsor of 
international cybercrime’’ means a country, 
the government of which systematically— 
(A) commits international cybercrime; 
(B) supports, facilitates, encourages, or ex-
pressly consents to international cybercrime 
by third parties, including contractors, prox-
ies, and affiliates; or 
(C) fails to take reasonable steps to detect, 
investigate, or address cybercrime occurring 
within its territory or through the use of its 
infrastructure. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Information and communication tech-
nologies underpin the prosperity and na-
tional security of the United States. How-
ever, the widespread use of these tech-
nologies also poses serious risks. In par-
ticular, cybercrime (criminal activity using 
digital means) presents an acute and growing 
threat to the economic, strategic, and secu-
rity interests of the United States and its al-
lies and partners. 
(2) Cybercriminals cause massive harm. 
According to National Institute of Standards 
and Technology estimates, in 2016, United 
States businesses lost between $167,900,000,000 
and 
$770,000,000,000 
to 
cybercrime, 
cor-
responding to between 0.9 percent and 4.1 
percent of the total United States gross do-
mestic product that year. The related risk 
and harm to public health and safety is in-
calculable and can only be expected to grow 
as digital technologies become more inter-
twined in daily life. 
(3) 
Using 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
tactics, 
cybercriminals— 
(A) steal United States intellectual prop-
erty and sensitive personal information; 
(B) defraud United States businesses and 
citizens; and 
(C) disrupt infrastructure critical to Amer-
icans’ health and safety. 
(4) The use of ransomware (malicious soft-
ware that encrypts and thereby prevents ac-
cess to data) until a ransom, often costing 
millions of dollars, is paid is a an especially 
destructive form of cybercrime. 
(5) In 2021, ransomware groups— 
(A) crippled or endangered some of the 
United States’ most critical infrastructure, 
including water utilities, hospitals, meat 
packing plants, and a critical fuel pipeline; 
and 
(B) extracted hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in ransom from United States businesses 
and their insurers. 
(6) United States allies and partners have 
also suffered major losses from cybercrime. 
Recent ransomware victims include Swedish 
supermarkets, Ireland’s national health serv-
ice, a leading European insurer, and a major 
German chemical manufacturer. 
(7) The Council of Europe’s Convention on 
Cybercrime, done at Budapest November 23, 
2001, states, ‘‘an effective fight against 
cybercrime requires increased, rapid and 
well-functioning international cooperation 
in criminal matters’’ and requires parties to 
outlaw digital fraud, digital forgery, intel-
lectual property theft through digital means, 
and offenses against confidentiality, integ-
rity, and availability of computer data and 
systems, among other misconduct. 
(8) In July 2021, the United Nations Group 
of Governmental Experts on Advancing re-
sponsible State behavior in cyberspace, 
which includes experts from the United 
States, Russia, and China, issued a report 
stating that countries are expected to ‘‘take 
all appropriate and reasonably available and 
feasible steps to detect, investigate and ad-
dress’’ known cybercriminal activity ema-
nating from within their borders. 
(9) Certain nations, including China, Rus-
sia, Iran, and North Korea, ignore, facilitate, 
or directly participate in cybercrime as a 
matter of national policy. 
(10) 
Russia 
is 
a 
global 
haven 
for 
cybercriminals, 
including 
ransomware 
groups responsible for attacks on fuel pipe-
lines, meat packing plants, and super-
markets in the United States and in Europe 
in 2021. These gangs operate freely and with 
the Kremlin’s tacit approval. By allowing 
cybercriminals to operate with impunity, 
Russia threatens international stability, un-
dermines international institutions, and dis-
regards international norms. 
(11) The People’s Republic of China uses 
cybercrime— 
(A) to undermine United States’ interests; 
and 
(B) to victimize United States’ businesses 
and government agencies. 
(12) In July 2021, Secretary of State 
Blinken stated, ‘‘The PRC’s Ministry of 
State Security (MSS) has fostered an eco-
system of criminal contract hackers who 
carry out both state-sponsored activities and 
cybercrime for their own financial gain. ... 
These contract hackers cost governments 
and business billions of dollars in stolen in-
tellectual property, ransom payments, and 
cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while 
the MSS has them on its payroll.’’. 
(13) Cybercrime is central to North Korea’s 
geopolitical strategy, helping the Kim Jong 
Un regime maintain its grip on power and 
providing essential resources for the coun-
try’s nuclear weapons program. 
(14) In February 2021, the Department of 
Justice indicted 3 North Korean military in-
telligence agents for a ‘‘wide-ranging crimi-
nal conspiracy to conduct a series of destruc-
tive cyberattacks, to steal and extort more 
than 
$1.3 
billion 
of 
money 
and 
cryptocurrency from financial institutions 
and companies, to create and deploy mul-
tiple malicious cryptocurrency applications, 
and to develop and fraudulently market a 
blockchain platform.’’. 
(15) North Korean hackers are responsible 
for many of the most brazen cybercrime 
campaigns, including— 
(A) the 2017 WannaCry global ransomware 
incident; 
(B) the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures; 
and 
(C) 
the 
attempted 
theft 
of 
nearly 
$1,000,000,000 from the Central Bank of Ban-
gladesh in 2016. 
(16) The Iranian regime is a prolific spon-
sor of cybercrime. Hackers linked to Iran’s 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps target 
businesses, academic institutions, and re-
search organizations around the world. 
(17) In 2018, the Department of Justice in-
dicted 9 Iranians for a coordinated campaign 
of cyber intrusions into computer systems 
belonging to 144 United States universities, 
176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 
47 domestic and foreign private sector com-
panies, the Department of Labor, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of 
Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Na-
tions, and the United Nations Children’s 
Fund. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) all nations must take reasonable steps 
to stop cybercriminal activities from taking 
place within their territories or through 
their infrastructure; 
(2) governments that tolerate, facilitate, or 
participate in cybercrime threaten the eco-
nomic and national security of the United 
States, United States allies and partners, 
and the international community; and 
(3) the rising threat of international 
cybercrime requires a robust, coordinated re-
sponse from the United States Government, 
United States allies and partners, and the 
private sector— 
(A) to prevent and counter international 
cybercriminal activity; and 
(B) to impose significant and tangible costs 
on cybercriminal groups and on governments 
that tolerate, facilitate, or participate in 
cybercrime. 
SEC. 1294. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It shall be the policy of the United 
States—

tilities report to Congress and obtain a spe-
cific statutory authorization for such intro-
duction. The President shall provide con-
tinuing hostilities reports to Congress 30 
days after the initial report and every 30 
days thereafter, in accordance with sub-
section (d). 
(b) AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES 
RELATING
TO HOSTILITIES.—In cases where 
the 
President 
introduces 
United 
States 
forces into hostilities or a situation where 
there is a serious risk of hostilities either be-
cause of the need to repel a sudden attack 
upon the United States, its territories or 
possessions, its armed forces, or other United 
States citizens overseas or because the con-
crete, specific, and immediate threat of such 
a sudden attack, and the time required to 
provide Congress with a briefing necessary to 
inform a vote to obtain prior authorization 
from Congress within 72 hours would prevent 
an effective defense against the attack or 
threat of immediate attack, the President 
shall— 
(1) within 48 hours of ordering the intro-
duction of United States forces into hos-
tilities or a situation where there is a seri-
ous risk of hostilities, inform Congress of the 
President’s decision, describe the action 
taken, the justification for proceeding with-
out prior authorization, and certifying either 
that hostilities have concluded or that they 
are continuing; and 
(2) not later than 7 calendar days after or-
dering the introduction of United States 
forces into hostilities or a situation where 
there is a serious risk of hostilities, submit 
to Congress a hostilities report and request 
for specific statutory authorization except in 
cases where a certification is submitted to 
Congress that the President— 
(A) has withdrawn, removed, and otherwise 
ceased the use of United States forces from 
the situation that triggered this require-
ment; and 
(B) does not intend to reintroduce them. 
(c) TERMINATION OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO 
HOSTILITIES.—If Congress does not enact a 
specific statutory authorization for United 
States forces to engage in hostilities in re-
sponse to a request in accordance with sub-
section (b) within 20 days after the introduc-
tion of United States forces into hostilities 
or a situation where there is a serious risk of 
hostilities, the President shall withdraw, re-
move, and otherwise cease the use of United 
States forces. This 20-day period shall be ex-
tended for not more than an additional 10 
days if the President determines, certifies, 
and justifies to Congress in writing that un-
avoidable military necessity involving the 
safety of the forces requires the continued 
use of the forces for the sole purpose of 
bringing about their safe removal from hos-
tilities. 
(d) CONTINUING
HOSTILITIES
REPORTS.—If 
the President obtains specific statutory au-
thorization, the President shall continue to 
provide hostilities reports to Congress on the 
United States’ forces’ engagement or pos-
sible engagement in hostilities whenever 
there is a material change in the informa-
tion previously reported under this section 
and in no event less frequently than every 30 
days from the delivery of the first hostilities 
report. 
(e) FORM.—Any report submitted pursuant 
to subsection (a), (b), or (d) shall be sub-
mitted to Congress in unclassified form 
without any designation relating to dissemi-
nation control and may include a classified 
annex only to the extent required to protect 
the national security of the United States. 
(f) TRANSMITTAL.—Each report submitted 
pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (d) shall be 
transmitted to each house of Congress on the 
same calendar day. The report shall be—

cordance with the rules of the appropriate 
House, the vote on final passage of the reso-
lution shall occur. 
(4) APPEALS FROM DECISIONS OF CHAIR.—Ap-
peals from the decisions of the Chair relating 
to the application of the rules of the Senate 
or the House of Representatives, as the case 
may be, to the procedure relating to a reso-
lution shall be decided without debate. 
(f) CONSIDERATION BY OTHER HOUSE.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—If, before the passage by

a part of the rules of each House, respec-

sales activity of such seller until the seller 
complies with such requirements.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
NIGHTINGALE 
AWARD 
WINNERS 
FOR 
THEIR 
DEDICATION TO NURSING 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor twelve Colorado nurses who have gone 
above and beyond the call of duty and been 
recognized by the Colorado Nurses Founda-
tion (CNF) with the Nightingale Award for 
working tirelessly to advance the nursing pro-
fession, improve quality and access to care, 
and positively impact their communities. 
The CNF has dedicated itself to creating a 
sustainable health care system for our com-
munity and the entire state of Colorado. 
Throughout their decades of work, and espe-
cially during the COVID–19 pandemic, they 
have continued to work tirelessly to advance 
their vision of a more diverse, inclusive, and 
equitable care environment for Colorado 
nurses and the people they serve. CNF offers 
scholarships, funds research projects, runs 
educational initiatives, and makes a concerted 
effort to recognize nurses who make a dif-
ference in the profession. 
To this end, CNF hosts the Nightingale Gala 
each year to recognize pioneers in nursing 
from across the state who have continuously 
pushed the boundaries of their profession. 
This year, the Foundation recognized twelve 
exemplary nurses who went to great lengths 
to serve their community by finding innovative 
solutions to problems like expanding tele-
health, combatting sexual assault, and large- 
scale vaccine administration. 
These nurses made a profound difference in 
our community, and I am proud to recognize 
the twelve Nightingale Award winners: 
Jenifer Bartel, RN, BSN from Parkview Med-
ical Center 
Kathy Casey, RN, PHD from Denver Health 
Jennifer Coffman, RN, MSN, JD from Chil-
dren’s Hospital Colorado 
Christina Denton, RN MSN from UC Health 
Amy Dreher, RN, BSN, MPH from Falcon 
School District 49 
Brian Fun, RN, BSN from Denver Health 
Medical Center 
Catherine Kleiner, RN, PhD from Children’s 
Hospital Colorado 
Stacey Kreil, RN, DNP from Centura- 
Penrose-St. Francis Health Services 
Dixie Melton, RN, MSN from Centura Health 
Ignacio Family Medicine 
Laura Sandoval-Adams, RN, BSN from 
Parkview Health System 
Rosalyn Walker, RN, MSN from Centura 
Health St. Thomas More Hospital 
Lori Wightman, RN, DNP from SCL Health. 
The work and sacrifice by nurses in our 
community has taken on a whole new mean-
ing these past few years. From twelve-hour 
shifts, to being forced to isolate from loved 
ones—nurses have held our community to-
gether while enduring enormous personal 
costs. Still, these nurses have overcome 
seemingly insurmountable challenges to pio-
neer breakthroughs in their profession. 
Our community is forever indebted to these 
heroes, and I am honored to have the oppor-
tunity to recognize the twelve Nightingale 
Award winners as well as thank the Colorado 
Nurses Foundation for their dedication to ad-
vancing the nursing profession and keeping 
our community healthy and safe.

IN MEMORY OF GEORGE 
CAMPBELL 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a great American, George B. Camp-
bell. Mr. Campbell lived in Winchester, Ken-
tucky and passed away on October 21, 2021. 
George Campbell was a proud veteran of 
the United States Army, enlisting in 1968. He 
served our nation with honor in Vietnam, 
where he was awarded the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, 
the Good Conduct Medal, and the Vietnam 
Campaign Medal. After his time in the military, 
Mr. Campbell enrolled in Georgetown College 
where he met his wife Rosemary. They were 
married for 47 years and have 2 sons, Jeff 
and Chris, and four grandchildren. Mr. Camp-
bell worked as a civil servant with the Depart-
ment of Defense. He retired after a 30-plus 
year distinguished career as the Chief of Op-
erations 
Division 
for 
Special 
Operations 
Forces Support Activity at Bluegrass Station. 
Mr. Campbell had a passion and a gift for 
serving others. On a trip to the Vietnam Wall 
Memorial in 2011, he observed a group from 
an Honor Flight from Chicago. Upon speaking 
with a medic from the group and several vet-
erans and guardians, he learned more about 
the Honor Flight organization and its profound 
impact on our nation’s veterans. Returning 
home, he became the co-founder of Honor 
Flight Kentucky. He was very active as a 
board member, officer, Ambassador and Flight 
Coordinator. Mr. Campbell’s work with Honor 
Flight brought joy, comradery, and a renewed 
sense of pride to hundreds of Kentucky vet-
erans. I came to know Mr. Campbell when I 
was given the opportunity to participate in 
Honor Flight Kentucky activities and I am 
grateful to Mr. Campbell for allowing me to be 
involved. 
Faith was a guiding light in the life of this 
humble servant leader. Mr. Campbell was a 
parishioner of Saint Joseph Catholic Church, 
where he was an active member and played 
guitar for Sunday mass. He volunteered at the 
Troy Bowling Campus of the Lexington VA 
Healthcare System and at various other chari-
table organizations. 
George Campbell was a true patriot, a fol-
lower of Christ, a family man, and an inspira-
tion to all who were fortunate enough to know 
him. While he will be missed, he leaves be-
hind a legacy of service that will continue. It 
was my honor to call him my friend and it is 
my honor to lift up the life of George B. Camp-
bell before the United States Congress.

HOMETOWN HERO—BANDS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the hard work and dedi-
cation of three TX 24 high schools: Colleyville 
Heritage High School, Keller High School and 
Carroll High School and their band directors 
Gary Barnard, Mark McGahey and Ken John-
son. These three high school marching bands 
have excelled, in showmanship and technical 
ability this year. Last weekend, they advanced 
to the state championship, which will be held 
over the next two weeks. 
I thank our students for representing North 
Texas, and their dedication and years of hard 
work. I also thank their band directors who 
spend their careers teaching and enriching the 
lives of students. I wish them the best in their 
upcoming performance and congratulate them 
on all of their hard work paying off.

IN HONOR OF TED BASSETT 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a great Kentuckian, James E. ‘‘Ted’’ 
Bassett III. Mr. Bassett was born in Lexington, 
Kentucky on October 26, 1921, one hundred 
years ago. Mr. Bassett is universally well-re-
spected and one of our finest citizens. 
Ted Bassett graduated from Yale in the 
early 1940’s. Soon after that, he was deployed 
to the South Pacific as a member of the 
United States Marine Corps. He served as an 
infantry officer in the 4th Marine Regiment, 6th 
Marine Division. Mr. Bassett led a rifle platoon 
during the Battle of Okinawa. He was twice 
wounded and received the Purple Heart and 
the Presidential Unit Citation. Mr. Bassett 
credits his service as a U.S. Marine with being 
the ‘‘most meaningful phase’’ of his life. He is 
the epitome of an American patriot. Humble in 
his valor, his love of our country is unmatched. 
Following WWII, Mr. Bassett worked as a 
newsprint salesman in New York, a tobacco 
farmer in Kentucky, Deputy Commissioner for 
the Department of Public Safety, and director 
of the Kentucky State Police. In 1968, he be-
came involved with Keeneland Association as 
an assistant to President Louis L. Haggin, II. 
He went on to become President, Chairman of 
the Board, Trustee, and Trustee Emeritus of 
Keeneland, where his tenure extends for 53

years. During his time at Keeneland, the track 
became one of the most prominent thorough-
bred racetracks in North America. Keeneland’s 
sales grew incredibly, and it became a major 
international auction house. 
Mr. Bassett’s leadership continued as Presi-
dent of the Breeder’s Cup, the Thoroughbred 
Racing Association, and the Thoroughbred 
Club of America. He served as a member of 
The Jockey Club as well as a Trustee of the 
National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, 
the University of Kentucky Equine Research 
Foundation, and Transylvania University. Mr. 
Bassett is undoubtably one of the most re-
spected figures in the thoroughbred industry. 
In 1996, he received an Eclipse Award of 
Merit for his contributions and in 2019 was in-
ducted into the Racing Hall of Fame. 
Mr. Bassett is a generous philanthropist in 
the central Kentucky area. He has a true love 
of people and would be as comfortable talking 
with the President of the United States or the 
Queen of England as he is talking with the 
staff at Keeneland. Ted Bassett is an incred-
ible patriot, a legend in the thoroughbred in-
dustry, a selfless individual, and a shining ex-
ample to us all. I have been honored to know 
him all of my life and it is my honor to recog-
nize this great American patriot before the 
United States Congress on his 100th birthday.

THE 
ATLANTA 
BRAVES 
ORGANIZATION 
FOR 
WINNING 
THE 
2021 
MAJOR 
LEAGUE BASEBALL WORLD SE-
RIES 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Atlanta Braves organi-
zation for winning the 2021 Major League 
Baseball World Series. On November 2, 2021, 
with a 7–0 victory in game 6 over the Houston 
Astros, the Atlanta Braves became World Se-
ries Champions for the first time since 1995. 
This team is an inspiration to every single 
Braves fan. A team of destiny. The team was 
88–73 and was under .500 as recently as Au-
gust. At one point in the season, the team had 
single digit odds to make the playoffs. As they 
seemed to hit every speed bump and road-
block along the way, very few believed they 
stood a chance; but every member of the 
team believed. Some players, such as Dansby 
Swanson, are locals; others, such as Ronald 
Acun˜a Jr., come from across the globe. 
Freddie Freeman has spent his entire career 
with the organization, while others are new to 
the team. Each of their families sacrificed spe-
cial moments while the team trained and 
played across the Major League. 
The Braves defeated the Milwaukee Brew-
ers, 3 games to 1, in the National League Di-
vision Series. The Braves then faced their foe 
from the 2020 National League Championship 
Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers. After having 
back to back walk-off victories in that series, 
the Braves beat the Dodgers, 4 games to 2, 
and won the National League Championship 
Series. Eddie Rosario, one of the newest addi-
tions to the Braves family, was selected as the 
2021 NLCS Most Valuable Player. 
The Braves began the World Series taking 
a game 1 victory over the Houston Astros, and 
went on to win the series, 4 games to 2. New 
Braves legend, Jorge Soler, was selected as 
the 2021 World Series Most Valuable Player 
after hitting 3 home runs in the series and 
being the first player in Major League Baseball 
history to hit a home run in the first plate ap-
pearance of a World Series. 
Alex Anthopoulos joined the Braves organi-
zation in 2017 as the Executive Vice President 
and General Manager, later being elevated to 
the President of Baseball Operations. He was 
previously part of the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Toronto Blue Jays, and Montreal Expos. Alex 
Anthopoulos masterfully navigated the off sea-
son 
by 
adding 
Pablo 
Sandoval, 
Ehire 
Adrianza, Guillermo Heredia, and Charlie Mor-
ton. After the devasting loss of Ronald Acun˜a 
Jr. to injury, Alex Anthopoulos made critical 
additions to the roster, acquiring Joc Peterson, 
Adam Duvall, Jorge Soler, and Richard Rodri-
guez. 
Manager Brian Snitker has been with the At-
lanta Braves organization since 1977, and has 
been a player, Minor League manager, and 
manager of the Atlanta Braves. Brian Snitker 
is a devoted family man and has spent many 
days away from his family mentoring players, 
many of whom he has watched grow into 
young men. Through his guidance, this team 
has become an inspiration to Braves fans, and 
to every young athlete watching them play. 
The Braves won the World Series with the 
dedication of team members: Freddie Free-
man, Ian Anderson, Jesse Chavez, Max Fried, 
Luke Jackson, Dylan Lee, Chris Martin, Tyler 
Matzek, A.J. Minter, Charlie Morton, Will 
Smith, Drew Smyly, Kyle Wright, Travis d’ 
Arnaud, William Contreras, Ehire Adrianza, 
Ozzie Albies, Orlando Arcia, Austin Riley, 
Dansby Swanson, Johan Camargo, Adam 
Duvall, Terrance Gore, Guillermo Heredia, Joc 
Pederson, Eddie Rosario, Jorge Soler, and 
Tucker Davidson. 
The Braves would not have made it to the 
World Series without the efforts of those team 
members playing in the regular season, such 
as: Ronald Acun˜a Jr., Abraham Almonte, 
Grant Dayton, Shane Greene, Jasseel De La 
Cruz, Yoan Lo´pez, Kyle Muller, Sean New-
comb, Richard Rodrı´guez, Mike Soroka, Spen-
cer Strider, Josh Tomlin, Touki Toussaint, 
Jacob 
Webb, 
Huascar 
Ynoa, 
Chadwick 
Tromp, and Cristian Pache. 
I thank Braves fans everywhere, for their 
passion and devotion to this team. They 
showed up to cheer from the stands, and 
stayed to celebrate in the Battery at Truist 
Park. Without each and every fan across this 
country, this would not have been possible. I 
thank each and every team member of Truist 
Park, the clubhouse, Minor League coaching 
staff, and support staff. Once again, the At-
lanta Braves are America’s team. 
This is the moment that the city of Atlanta 
and Braves fans everywhere have been 
dreaming of for quite some time. The Atlanta 
Braves are, once again, World Series Cham-
pions! Go Braves.

IN RECOGNITION OF NEAL K. 
TODD 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor Navy Fireman First 
Class Neal Kenneth Todd, who served aboard 
the USS Oklahoma, and we lost on December 
7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor. 
A Minnesota native, born in the city of 
Akeley on November 5, 1919, Neal enlisted in 
the Navy just days before his 21st birthday in 
the fall of 1940, making him one of eight chil-
dren of Irena Staffenhagen to serve in the 
armed forces. Each one of the children would 
return home safely, except for Neal, her fourth 
born. 
Neal was assigned to the USS Oklahoma at 
Pearl Harbor in Honolulu where he served 
alongside his brother, Fireman First Class, 
Wesley Roland Todd. America was not yet at 
war, but on December 7, 1941, Neal would be 
among the first Americans to make the ulti-
mate sacrifice in the largest conflict humanity 
has ever known. His brother barely survived 
the attack. 
What makes his sacrifice even more crucial 
to recognize today is the time and effort it took 
to get here. On the day of the attack at Pearl 
Harbor, Neal and other sailors like him were 
considered missing for decades and presumed 
to be casualties. Over 400 crewmembers died 
on the USS Oklahoma alone. At the time, the 
U.S. military lacked the technological capacity 
to identify these individuals and return them 
home. 
Until March 1942, when months later, Neal’s 
mother was formally notified that he was miss-
ing in action and had likely perished, but his 
family was not offered the closure of a proper 
burial. Families like Neal’s have been left in 
the dark for years, knowing that surely their 
brothers and sons would not be able to share 
another smile or embrace with them, but still 
wishing they could give one last goodbye. 
Thanks to recent efforts by the Defense 
POW/MIA Accounting Agency started in 2015, 
along with the assistance of family members 
of the lost, DNA recognition and retrieval of re-
mains from Pearl Harbor is finally possible. 
Neal Todd’s identity was confirmed in Feb-
ruary of this year, and this July, dozens of

members of his family welcomed him home to 
Minnesota along with a traditional water salute 
on the airstrip of Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport. 
Neal Todd was finally returned to his home-
town of Akeley, Minnesota, 80 years after his 
death for a funeral service before being buried 
in his final resting place next to his mother 
and father. 
I hope my fellow Members of Congress can 
join me in honoring Navy Fireman First Class 
Neal K. Todd and commend the efforts by the 
DOD and families like Neal’s in bringing our 
honorable lost back home to rest. I thank 
them.

to recognize the life of Mr. James ‘‘Jim’’ Har-
old Rabbers of Stevensville, Michigan who 
passed away on October 11, 2021. 
Jim was a true Michigander through and 
through. He was a loving husband, and caring 
father and friend to all. Born and raised in 
Southwest Michigan, he attended Lakeshore 
High School and went on to attend Western 
Michigan University. After college, Jim went on 
to sell insurance and build warm relationships 
throughout the Stevensville community. He 
was a fan of all sports and had a special place 
in his heart for the Wolverines. He could talk 
sports all day long, but his real gift was form-
ing friendships that stood the test of time. 
Jim participated in sports throughout high 
school and played and officiated intramural 
sports in college. He even met the love of his 
life, Mary, playing softball and volleyball at St. 
Paul Lutheran Church. Mary had just come 
into town as a new teacher at a local school. 
The pair quickly bonded over their love of 
sports and competitive spirits and married in 
the summer of 1986. They became parents to 
four 
wonderful 
children: 
Derek 
Rabbers 
(Claire), Chelsea Rabbers, Megan Spaude 
(Jason), and Travis Rabbers. Jim and Mary 
have been blessed with three grandchildren: 
Wesley, Jay and Samuel Rabbers. 
Jim is survived by his wife, four children, 
daughter and son-in-law, three grandchildren, 
his brothers: Thom (Rhonda) Rabbers and 
Dan (Diana) Rabbers, his sisters: Susan (Rob-
ert) Vandervleit and Jodi Rabbers, as well as 
a number of extended family members.

HONORING THE HEROIC SERVICE 
OF 2020 VETERAN OF THE YEAR 
GARTH D. LLOYD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Garth D. Lloyd for his recogni-
tion as the 2020 Veteran of the Year. 
Garth Lloyd was born and raised in Roch-
ester, New York. In 1969, Mr. Lloyd was draft-
ed into the U.S. Army and deployed to Viet-
nam with the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regi-
ment, 25th Infantry Division as an 11 Bravo, 
Infantryman. Coincidentally, Mr. Lloyd’s former 
battalion is now assigned to 2nd Brigade 
Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division at Fort 
Drum. 
While bravely defending his country, Mr. 
Lloyd was seriously wounded in action by a 
booby trap on February 12, 1970 and evacu-
ated to the United States. Subsequently, Garth 
was medically discharged as a Specialist 4th 
class. For his courageous service, Mr. Lloyd 
was awarded the Purple Heart, Air Medal, 
Vietnam Service Medal, National Defense 
Service Medal, and Good Conduct Medal. 
After the war, Mr. Lloyd continued to serve 
his community by working at the water treat-
ment plant in the city of Saratoga Springs. 
Upon his retirement in 2012, Garth began vol-
unteering at the Saratoga County VA Mentor 
Program, where he served as a mentor and 
friend to numerous disabled veterans. Mr. 
Lloyd has also spent many years volunteering 
his time as a docent at the New York State 
Military Museum. He works closely with the 
Docent Advisory Committee and the education 
opportunity program, which engages middle 
and high school students visiting the museum. 
Mr. Lloyd, and his wife Diane, have instilled 
their commitment to service in their son, a 
physician’s assistant at Albany Medical Cen-
ter, and their three grandchildren. 
The Veteran of the Year Award is a pres-
tigious 
recognition 
co-sponsored 
by 
the 
Friends of the New York State Military Mu-
seum and the Capital District of New York 
Chapter of the Association of the United 
States Army. Garth Lloyd has led a life de-
voted to selfless service and volunteerism and 
it is clear why he was chosen as the 2020 
Veteran of the Year. On behalf of New York’s 
21st District, I would like to thank Garth for his 
service and congratulate him on his recogni-
tion as the 2020 Veteran of the Year.

RECOGNIZING HANEEN OMAR FOR 
HER SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of Haneen 
Omar. A brilliant entrepreneur and dedicated 
civil servant, Haneen has made it her life’s 
work to aid the underprivileged and make our 
community a better place to live. 
Many American families struggle to find 
quality caregiving for their loved-ones, forcing 
them to shoulder the immense responsibility 
themselves. In 2016, Haneen recognized this 
need in our community and founded the 2nd 
Home Adult Day Service Center of Aurora to 
provide the elderly and individuals with disabil-
ities daytime programming, emotional support, 
and 
assistance 
with 
healthcare 
issues. 
Haneen designed 2nd Home to provide the 
highest quality care to these individuals so 
family members and caregivers can take a 
break and relieve stress—all while maintaining 
the much-needed peace of mind that their 
loved ones are in safe hands. 
Haneen did not stop there. In 2019, she 
founded Helm Community Services (HCS), 
and this past August, HCS organized the sec-
ond annual ‘‘Taste of the Middle East’’ festival 
to celebrate the Middle Eastern culture that is 
such a rich part of our community. Community 
members from every walk of life came to-
gether to listen to Middle Eastern artists and 
try Middle Eastern staples like Manooshe, 
Turkish Coffee Cup Reading, Henna, and deli-
cious food from local restaurants. Our commu-
nity is stronger for its embrace of diversity. 
Throughout Haneen’s career, she has been 
a tireless advocate for those who are all-too- 
often marginalized. Driven by her mission to 
bring the community together—regardless of 
beliefs, race, or cultural background—Haneen 
has found unbelievable strength in differences 
and diversity. I congratulate Haneen on her in-
credible achievements and express my sin-
cere gratitude for her dedication, leadership, 
and service to our community.

HONORING LAKE FOREST CHAR-
TER SCHOOL OF NEW ORLEANS, 
LOUISIANA 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize New Orleans’ own 
Lake Forest Charter School and its designa-
tion as a National Blue Ribbon School by the 
United States Department of Education. 
This is the second time in the last decade 
that Lake Forest has received this honor, only 
one of eight in the entire state of Louisiana 
and one of 325 schools across the nation. 
This recognition is particularly important be-
cause Lake Forest Charter School is fairly 
unique among the list of Blue Ribbon schools. 
The student population is 99 percent stu-
dents of color, and 71 percent of students 
come from economically disadvantaged back-
grounds. 
Lake Forest Charter School is a living ex-
ample of how schools can create a space that 
allows their students to thrive and succeed at 
the highest levels. 
This week, Blue Ribbon Schools are being 
celebrated at an awards ceremony in Wash-
ington, D.C. hosted by the Department of Edu-
cation. 
It is my sincere honor to add my voice to 
the chorus of congratulations for Lake Forest’s 
students, teachers, and staff. 
Additionally, I want to add a special ac-
knowledgment for Mardele Simmons Early, 
who is a recipient of the 2021 Terrel H. Bell 
Award for Outstanding School Leadership. 
Congratulations.

end of the war he began working in a clothing 
factory producing men’s suits. He met his wife 
on the pocket set of the factory, marrying in 
1944. Mr. Gubitosi has worked tirelessly his 
entire life tailoring, bartending, and land-
scaping, and notably commuting by bus in 
every type of weather. Since 2000, Mr. 
Gubitosi has called Florida home. Our great 
state is lucky to have Mr. Gubitosi as a resi-
dent and I am thankful for his service and sac-
rifice.

RECOGNIZING VINSON CHAPEL 
AME’S 100TH YEAR OF SERVICE 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Vinson Chapel Afri-
can Methodist Episcopal Church which is cele-
brating its 100th year of service to the commu-
nity of Clinton Charter Township, Michigan. 
Vinson Chapel AME is one of Macomb 
County’s historic Black congregations, growing 
out of a prayer group first organized by Lewis 
and Betty Vinson in 1921. The members ini-
tially met in the Vinson family’s home. Soon, 
the budding congregation moved to an out-
door tent to accommodate a larger prayer 
group. After conducting services in different 
spaces over the years, the congregation joy-
fully arrived on Sunday, May 22, 1977 to their 
current sanctuary on Quinn Road in Clinton 
Township. 
Over the decades, Vinson Chapel AME has 
established itself as an important spiritual cen-
ter in Macomb County, going above and be-
yond to serve congregants as well as the 
greater community. The congregation has or-
ganized countless reading programs, edu-
cational workshops, voting drives, Census 
drives, and so much more. Most recently, 
when the COVID–19 pandemic interrupted in- 
person services, the church adapted to virtual 
livestreams to keep the congregation safe and 
prevent the spread of the virus. Under the de-
termined 
leadership 
of 
Reverend 
Twylla 
Lucas, the church rose to meet the additional 
needs of the community in this challenging 
moment, organizing vaccination clinics and 
distributing essential supplies. 
I am proud to have the honor of recognizing 
this important centennial for the Vinson Chap-
el African Methodist Episcopal Church. I en-
courage my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Vinson Chapel AME on one hundred 
years of ministry and service.

HONORING AIREEN SNYDER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Aireen Snyder, a community 
leader and President of the Filipino American 
Association of Iowa, as Iowan of the Week. 
Diversity is one of the greatest strengths of 
our state, with people from all different back-
grounds coming together to form an incredible 
community in Iowa. There is no better way to 
celebrate this diversity than with Filipino Herit-
age Month and Aireen Snyder, who has 
worked tirelessly to promote the values of 
community and diversity throughout our state. 
Arriving in Iowa from the Philippines in 
2008, Aireen quickly became involved with the 
thriving Filipino community. She has played an 
active role in the Filipino American Associa-
tion, chairing several committees, editing the 
newsletter and now is President. Perhaps 
most impressive was her leadership in cre-
ating a Filipino Language class. With language 
being such a valuable aspect of culture, 
Aireen developed an entire curriculum and 
worked with Des Moines Area Community Col-
lege to host a course that was very well at-
tended. 
Aireen holds a great amount of pride for the 
history and legacy of the Filipino American As-
sociation of Iowa. The association formed in 
1975 with the goal of promoting and enhanc-
ing cultural and heritage awareness of the 
Philippines among Iowans. This important mis-
sion is carried out through a variety of events 
and initiatives. For example, as President, 
Aireen has overseen the humanitarian and 
charitable aid that the association offers to its 
community, including legal assistance and col-
lege scholarships. Most notably, the organiza-
tion raised $14,000 following the ‘‘super ty-
phoon’’ in the Philippines. The funds were 
used to support a variety of non-profit organi-
zations in the country, including the Filipino 
Red Cross. 
Community events are also an important as-
pect of the Filipino American Association of 
Iowa and Aireen’s work as president. Events 
range from Christmas parties, parol lantern 
making, and most recently the Des Moines 
‘‘Celebrasian’’ hosted by the Iowa Asian Alli-
ance. The association proudly hosted three 
booths featuring Filipino food, clothing and tra-
ditions. 
With nearly 5,000 Filipino Americans resid-
ing in Iowa, it is only fitting that we honor such 
an impactful leader and community builder, 
Aireen Snyder, for Filipino Heritage month. 
Her commitment to her culture and home 
country is a testament to the beautiful diversity 
in Iowa that makes our state stronger. I am 
humbled and inspired by Aireen’s work for the 
Filipino community of Iowa. It is my honor to 
name her Iowan of the Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CARR 
CENTER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the Carr Center in Detroit, Michigan 
as they celebrate thirty years of preserving, 
presenting, promoting, and developing African 
and African-American cultural arts traditions 
within our multicultural community in south-
eastern Michigan. 
Founded in 1991 as the Arts League of 
Michigan, the Carr Center has worked to fulfill 
its mission of bringing artistic excellence with 
a wide array of programming to the commu-
nities of Detroit. Building upon its initial cre-
ative placemaking, the Carr Center has be-
come a destination and hub for the performing 
arts in Detroit. 
In order to bring outstanding artistry to the 
community, the Carr Center has implemented 
three pillars of programming—Carr Center 
Presents and Carr Center Contemporary focus 
on performing and visual arts, while the Carr 
Center Arts Academy offers in-school and in-
tensive summer arts education opportunities. 
Please join me in recognizing the Carr Cen-
ter’s numerous contributions to southeastern 
Michigan over the past three decades as we 
wish them well in the years to come. Carr 
Center is a true gem in the communities of 
Michigan’s 13th District Strong.

Every statement about me in the October 24 
article was false or misleading. Moreover, the

author knew they were malicious and false 
when he made them. 
For example, the author lies and says that 
I offered ‘‘blanket pardons’’ for unknown peo-
ple for crimes that had not yet occurred. First, 
there is no such thing as a ‘‘blanket pardon.’’ 
The author states that a ‘‘blanket pardon’’ can 
be used to convey legal immunity on a person 
forever in perpetuity, presumably for any crime 
including murder or arson. It is ridiculous to 
say this, but he did in fact write this, and he 
knew no such thing occurred and nothing like 
that exists. Rolling Stone did this to defame 
me and make it look like I was planning for vi-
olence on January 6. This is malice. 
My work on pardons is a public record on 
file with the National Archives. For example, I 
wrote letters to the White House and the Of-
fice of Pardons on behalf of Stephen Bannon, 
former Congressman Rick Renzi, and for 
members of We Build the Wall. The President 
in fact granted pardons to Mr. Bannon and Mr. 
Renzi. But these pardons pertained to specific 
allegations in a criminal complaint or an actual 
conviction. These are not ‘‘blanket’’ pardons 
that forgive a person of all crimes forever, like 
a Papal indulgence. 
The author and Rolling Stone Magazine 
falsely claim I planned for violence by merely 
attending a rally on January 6 or lending pub-
lic support for this speech prior to January 6. 
Or by speaking out on the floor of the House 
under the Electoral Count Act. These allega-
tions and statements are false, defamatory, 
and malicious. There is no evidence of this 
because it never happened. To conflate sup-
port for election integrity, and support for the 
President to speak, with support for violence is 
false and defamatory. To then claim I planned 
the violence and did so to such a degree I 
was inducing people to commit violence with 
the prospect of the mythical ‘‘blanket pardon’’ 
is beyond the pale defamatory. 
At this time Rolling Stone refuses to issue a 
correction. Indeed, it published a follow up ar-
ticle on October 26 doubling down on its mali-
cious defamation. 
I continue to demand a retraction. And an 
apology. 
Rolling Stone Magazine has a history of 
lying and defamation. It’s ivermectin story 
turned out to be pure fiction. So is this one 
about me. 
Since it refuses to correct the story, retract 
it publicly with a full apology, I will be inves-
tigating legal options. The malicious lies this 
magazine has spread went viral and I received 
hate mail, death threats, and opprobrium 
across the country by people who believe 
what this author wrote. I will not accept this.
