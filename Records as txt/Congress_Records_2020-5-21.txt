THURSDAY, MAY 21, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord of our lives, make these mo-
ments of prayer more than mere words, 
but may this reverent pause fill our 
hearts with gratitude and love for You. 
May our lawmakers appreciate the fact 
that through prayer, they have the 
privilege of talking to You, the super-
intendent of the universe. 
Lord, inspire them to use this inter-
cessory opportunity to seek Your wis-
dom and guidance, knowing that You 
are eager to help them. Give us all the 
wisdom to remember that You con-
tinue to be our refuge and strength, al-
ways ready to help in times of trouble. 
And Lord, as we approach Memorial 
Day, thank You for the men and 
women who gave their lives for this 
Nation while serving in the U.S. mili-
tary. We are grateful also for the great 
sacrifices made by their loved ones. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NIGERIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
we all ought to be very concerned, as I 
am, about the ongoing religious perse-
cution happening in Nigeria. It may be 
happening in a lot of countries, but I 
just want to mention Nigeria today. 
In the last 6 months, there have been 
multiple attacks. This includes the 
murder of 11 Christians by extremists 
identified as part of ISIS, and—can you 
believe it—the beheading of a pastor by 
Boko Haram militants. West Africa re-
leased a barbaric video of a child of 
about 10 years old executing a Chris-
tian. 
The Nigerian authorities need to stop 
this persecution right now, and our 
own government, the U.S. Government, 
needs to do what it can to support that 
effort. For sure, those responsible must 
be held accountable for their actions. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. All month, the 
Senate has been on the job attending 
to the needs of our country. We legis-
lated, we confirmed nominees, we held 
major hearings, and conducted over-
sight on the historic response to 
COVID–19. 
Yesterday, we learned that our Sen-
ate action will continue to contrast 
with our absentee neighbors across the 
Rotunda. 
While 
essential 
workers 
across the country continue to clock 
in, the Democratic House of Represent-
atives has essentially put itself on paid 
leave for months. Since the early days 
of this crisis, the self-described ‘‘Peo-
ple’s House’’ has been suspiciously 
empty of people. I understand they 
have convened for legislative session a 
grand total of 2 days in the last 8 
weeks. At this point, I am wondering if 
we should send Senators over there to 
collect their newspaper and water the 
plants. 
It is not just their physical absence; 
it is House Democrats absent from any 
serious discussions at all. About the 
only product to emerge from their 
lengthy sabbatical has been a 1,800- 
page, $3 trillion messaging bill that 
couldn’t even unite their own con-
ference. 
Yesterday, the Speaker announced 
this arrangement will continue for an-
other 45 days at least, but there is a 
new wrinkle. House Democrats jammed 
through a precedent-breaking remote 
voting scheme that will let 1 Member 
cast 10 additional votes—1 Member cast 
10 additional votes. Actually, 1 person, 
11 votes. Remember, these are the peo-
ple who want to remake every State’s 
election laws. 
There are several problems with this. 
One of them happens to be article I, 
section 5 of the U.S. Constitution,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2564 
May 21, 2020 
which says a majority of each House 
shall constitute a quorum to do busi-
ness. For about 231 years, Congress has 
managed to fulfill this job require-
ment. They worked through a Civil 
War, two World Wars, terrorist threats, 
and a major pandemic without trying 
to shirk this duty. The 12th Congress 
endured the War of 1812, including the 
occupation of Washington and the 
burning of this very building that we 
are in right now without abandoning 
in-person meetings. 
The Constitution requires a physical 
quorum to do business. Normally, both 
Chambers may presume one. But any 
House Member has a right to demand 
an in-person attendance check. The 
Democrats’ new rule says one person 
may 
mark 
himself 
and 
10 
others 
present, even if they are nowhere in 
sight, which is a flatout lie. 
There will be enormous constitu-
tional questions around anything the 
House does if they fail to demonstrate 
a real quorum, but plow ahead anyhow. 
They have had 2 normal workdays in 8 
weeks and one absurd, unserious pro-
posal. And now they are playing games 
with the Constitution so they can con-
tinue their never-ending spring break 
well into July. 
Let’s come over here to the Senate. 
In the past 3 weeks, we have filled cru-
cial posts at the National Counterintel-
ligence and Security Center, the Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission, and the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
Today, we will confirm the next Di-
rector of National Intelligence. JOHN 
RATCLIFFE
will lead the intelligence 
community in countering threats from 
great powers, rogue nations, and ter-
rorists, and ensuring that work is un-
tainted by political bias. 
The Banking Committee heard from 
Chairman 
Powell 
and 
Secretary 
Mnuchin 
on 
the 
workings 
of 
the 
CARES Act and the state of our econ-
omy. The Homeland Security and Gov-
ernment Affairs Committee has re-
ported the nominee to be Special In-
spector General for Pandemic Recovery 
Programs. 
The Special Committee on Aging is 
examining all the ways this crisis has 
hurt America’s seniors. 
The HELP Committee has discussed 
with top experts like Dr. Fauci and Ad-
miral Giroir how schools, universities, 
and businesses will begin to reopen. 
Senator CORNYN and I are working on 
legal protections that our healthcare 
workers deserve and institutions will 
need if they want to return to anything 
reassembling normal. 
On the floor, we have passed major 
bills, renewing key national security 
tools and dialing up the consequences 
for Communist China’s abuse of human 
rights. 
In short, the Senate has just followed 
the lead of the American people. For 
months now, healthcare workers have 
been clocking in to help and heal 
strangers. Every minute on the job is 
an act of selflessness and bravery. 
Families have forged new routines and 
set up home offices and home schools 
overnight. Community volunteers have 
found new ways to pitch in and help 
the vulnerable from 6 feet apart. 
Tens of millions of workers have kept 
collecting paychecks instead of pink 
slips because of our Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which sent hundreds of 
billions of dollars to keep small busi-
nesses alive. 
COVID–19 has killed nearly 100,000 
Americans. It has cost tens of millions 
their jobs. This is a generational trag-
edy. But in the midst of it, our country 
is pulling together. 
My home State of Kentucky is show-
ing us how it is done. A glass producer 
transformed its operation to make pro-
tective shields for businesses. A high 
school principal, Evan Jackson, in-
vented a virtual commencement so 
graduates didn’t go uncelebrated. Dr. 
Erin Frazier, a pediatrician, somehow 
found the spare time to stand up 
brandnew food pantries. Restaurants 
are spreading hope and hospitality by 
donating meals to first responders. 
And 
one 
group 
of 
restaurants 
headquartered 
in 
Louisville 
called 
Texas Roadhouse has gone to great 
lengths to avoid layoffs. The founder 
gave up his salary and put his own 
money into a worker assistance fund. 
So far they have spent $17 million on 
their 
workers, 
covering 
everything 
from healthcare premiums to bonuses. 
These past few months have been try-
ing indeed, but the American people 
have been truly inspiring. This spring, 
the Senate wrote and passed the larg-
est rescue package in American history 
to try to help bridge this period. This 
Nation of nearly 330 million people put 
their lives on pause to protect our med-
ical system, and it worked. 
The American people did what Amer-
icans do: They got it done. We kept our 
healthcare system intact; we did not 
let this virus break us; and as far as we 
know, not one single American who 
needed a ventilator could not get one. 
We have not yet won the war, but the 
citizens of this Nation have won an im-
portant battle. 
What comes next? Sustaining this 
flattened curve will take vigilance. 
Safely reopening schools, universities, 
and businesses will take care and lead-
ership. The race for even more testing, 
therapeutics, and of course a vaccine 
will be one great national project. 
Rebuilding the prosperity we had just 
a few months ago will be another. Life 
will not go right back to normal. Re-
pairing the damage will take cre-
ativity. But the greatest country in 
world history will find a more sustain-
able middle ground. 
Every one of my Senate colleagues 
should be proud of how we helped our 
Nation win this battle. Every day, our 
historic rescue package has continued 
to push out money and aid. Every day, 
we are working on ways to smooth the 
road toward reopening that lies before 
us. 
The American people have already 
been heroes. It is our honor as Senators 
to stand with them.

The

OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
one unfortunate side effect of the 
COVID–19 pandemic is that we have be-
come accustomed to the recitation of 
grim statistics. 
The United States now leads the 
world in the number of confirmed cases 
of the coronavirus with more than 1.5 
million. Another 2.4 million workers 
filed jobless claims this week, joining 
the more than 38 million Americans 
who have applied for unemployment as-
sistance since the crisis began. 
Very soon, our country will reach an-
other grim milestone. We are fast ap-
proaching the day when more than 
100,000 American lives will be lost to 
COVID–19—the size of a small city 
erased from the map. 
Speaker PELOSI and I sent a letter to 
President Trump this morning, re-
questing that the American flag be 
flown at half-mast on all public build-
ings on the day the toll reaches 100,000. 
As families all across this great coun-
try mourn the loss of friends, col-
leagues, and loved ones, flying the flag

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2565 
May 21, 2020 
at half-mast would be a national ex-
pression of grief. 
Of course, this weekend is also Me-
morial Day, when we commemorate 
the so many Americans who, through 
the centuries, have lost their lives for 
our country, and we never forget them. 
We never forget them. I hope, on Me-
morial Day, every American will take 
a minute amidst this crisis to remem-
ber our veterans who have served and 
made great sacrifice and to remember 
their families as well. 
Now, in a flash, this disease has 
washed over our country like a flood, 
changing nearly every aspect of Amer-
ican society except, perhaps, the Re-
publican Senate. If you looked at our 
activity in the last 3 weeks, you would 
hardly know that there was a COVID 
crisis. 
Leader MCCONNELL called the Senate 
back into session 3 weeks ago. In that 
time, the Republican leadership has 
not put one bill on the floor of the Sen-
ate related to COVID–19—not one vote 
on 
legislation 
having 
to 
do 
with 
COVID–19 in the entire month of May. 
The House has not been in regular 
session, but it has voted on many more 
COVID-related bills this month than 
the Republican Senate. For Leader 
MCCONNELL to say that the Senate is 
working and the House is derelict is 
the opposite of what happened. 
The House has passed a major bill 
dealing with COVID. We have done 
nothing on this floor to vote on any-
thing about COVID. 
For Leader MCCONNELL to think we 
are doing our job by voting for some 
rightwing judges, by engaging in some 
sort of show trials to go to pursue con-
spiracy theories from the far right and 
even from Russia to besmirch political 
opponents past and present—that is not 
what we should be doing. 
When Americans look at what the 
House has done over the last 3 weeks 
and what the Senate has done over the 
last 3 weeks, they will see that the 
House has done far more on COVID 
than 
the 
Senate 
because 
Leader 
MCCONNELL is not allowing the Senate 
to focus on the issues we should be fo-
cusing on. 
What little business we have done re-
lated to the crisis—oversight hearings 
in a few committees—required weeks of 
pressure from Senate Democrats. We 
had to push and push and push our col-
leagues to even fulfill their most basic 
responsibilities to do a hearing, to do 
oversight as to whether the money 
that we passed weeks ago is being 
spent properly. 
In the interest of making incre-
mental 
progress—just 
incremental 
progress—Democrats have asked this 
Chamber to consent to smaller meas-
ures related to our relief efforts. We 
asked our colleagues to increase trans-
parency in the small business lending 
program. We asked to release the uned-
ited CDC guidance to help families, 
States, businesses, and schools reopen 
safely. Senate Republicans blocked 
those ideas. 
The inaction by Senate Republicans 
has gotten so bad that even one of my 
colleagues on the other side doesn’t 
want to adjourn today because his 
party 
has 
done 
nothing 
on 
the 
coronavirus for an entire month. 
Leader MCCONNELL has long presided 
over a legislative graveyard, but in this 
time of national crisis, when Ameri-
cans all across the country are des-
perate for relief, the inaction of Senate 
Republicans is staggering. 
Making matters worse, Republicans 
aren’t just ignoring the coronavirus; 
they are practically sprinting toward 
focusing on a partisan election instead 
of our coming together and trying to 
solve this problem. 
Instead of debating COVID-related 
legislation on the floor, Leader MCCON-
NELL has asked the Senate to confirm 
some rightwing judges. In the Home-
land Security Committee, the Repub-
lican chairman convened a hearing 
that slanders the family of the Presi-
dent’s political opponent with con-
spiracy theories invented by none 
other than the Kremlin. The Homeland 
Security Committee should be holding 
hearings with the FEMA Adminis-
trator about the alarming shortage of 
PPE. But, instead, the Republican ma-
jority is busy following breadcrumbs 
left by Putin and his intelligence serv-
ices. What a disgrace, what a sham, 
and what a dereliction of duties. 
The House—again, they are doing 
their job. They passed a major bill. 
Senator MCCONNELL says: Let’s wait. 
Let’s pause. He doesn’t see immediate 
urgency. Well, Americans do. 
In the Judiciary Committee now, the 
Republican chairman wants to issue a 
bonanza of subpoenas about yet an-
other conspiracy theory related to the 
2016 elections in the hopes of diving 
down as many rabbit holes as can be 
found. 
And today, in the Foreign Relations 
Committee, the Republican chairman 
is holding an audio-only hearing to ad-
vance President Trump’s handpicked 
nominee for the Voice of America, a 
nominee who is currently under inves-
tigation by the attorney general of 
Washington, DC. That is right. The Re-
publican majority of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee is turning the cam-
eras off so that the press and the public 
can’t see what they are doing—giving a 
promotion to Steve Bannon’s business 
partner in the middle of a health crisis. 
This is such a gross misuse of power by 
the majority. 
While 
unemployment 
reaches 
astronomic levels, the Senate Repub-
lican caucus is off on a wild goose 
chase. The conspiracy caucus is back 
with a vengeance. That is the name of 
this Republican Senate majority: the 
‘‘conspiracy caucus.’’ That is where 
their zeal is; that is where their focus 
is—not on eradicating COVID, not on 
helping people get back to work, not on 
feeding hungry families but on pur-
suing conspiracy theories. Wow. 
The Memorial Day weekend in a 
State work period is usually a time for 
Senators to meet with their constitu-
ents and hear their concerns. In these 
strange times, we will not be able to do 
that in person, but we will find ways to 
hear from the people in our States, and 
I expect my Republican colleagues will 
get an earful. 
The American people should be furi-
ous about what Washington Repub-
licans are doing in Congress and, more 
to the point, what they are failing to 
do. 
As we approach a day of reckoning, 
more than 100,000 deaths from the 
coronavirus, I cannot imagine the 
American people are happy that Senate 
Republicans can’t focus on coronavirus 
because they are too busy doing opposi-
tion research for the President’s reelec-
tion campaign. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN L. RATCLIFFE 
On another matter, later today, the 
Senate will vote on whether to confirm 
Representative 
JOHN
RATCLIFFE
to 
serve as the Director of National Intel-
ligence, which oversees the 17 different 
intelligence agencies. It is one of the 
most important posts that this Cham-
ber is asked to fill. It requires someone 
with unimpeachable integrity, deep ex-
perience, and the independence and 
backbone to speak truth to power. 
That is what DNIs, including the pre-
vious one, Dan Coats, did. 
Unfortunately, 
Mr. 
RATCLIFFE 
doesn’t even come close to meeting 
that high bar. Earlier this week, I had 
the opportunity to speak with Con-
gressman RATCLIFFE over the phone. I 
expressed my concerns that his history 
as a vocal defender of the President 
casts doubt on his qualifications and 
credibility. 
I asked him to simply confirm the 
unequivocal conclusion of our 17 intel-
ligence agencies that Putin interfered 
in the 2016 elections to help President 
Trump. He could not confirm it. 
I asked him if he would commit to 
basic, specific steps to improve trans-
parency and communications between 
DNI and Congress—for instance, that 
every 2 weeks the staffs of the Gang of 
8 be briefed by the DNI on what is hap-
pening in terms of election inter-
ference, that immediately Congress be 
notified if Russia or another foreign 
country attempts to interfere in our 
election. I asked him to do that within 
72 hours. In neither case would he com-
mit. That is not the kind of DNI we 
need. 
So Congressman RATCLIFFE did little 
to address my concerns about his nomi-
nation, and I will vehemently oppose 
his nomination today. More than ever, 
we need the right person to serve as 
DNI. Over the past few months we have 
watched President Trump try to short 
circuit nearly every measure of inde-
pendence and accountability within the 
executive branch. 
By baselessly firing one inspector 
general after another, President Trump 
has shown he will not tolerate anyone

standing up to his personal political in-
terests, right or wrong. This is a dan-
gerous pattern that should send a shiv-
er down the spine of anyone who be-
lieves in democracy and is particularly 
relevant to the intelligence commu-
nity, which must be able to inform the 
President of difficult truths. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE, unfortunately, has 
not demonstrated the qualities nor the 
independence that we should expect of 
the next leader of the intelligence com-
munity. I will vote no and encourage 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, for the sake of the independence 
and strength of our intelligence com-
munity, which has served us so well for 
decades, to join me in voting no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
minority leader just got up and at-
tacked the Senate for not doing any-
thing and then proceeded to announce 
that we are going to be voting today on 
the Director of National Intelligence. 
It seems like a pretty important posi-
tion—the person who is in charge of all 
the intelligence activities that we con-
duct around the world to make sure 
that we keep our country safe. 
So if the Senate is here and not doing 
anything, it seems like a real con-
tradiction to suggest that we are actu-
ally going to vote today on a position 
that is important to America’s na-
tional security interests. 
It is just one of many that we are 
going to be voting on and have been 
voting on over the past several weeks. 
The other thing the Democrat leader 
forgot to acknowledge is that last week 
we passed reforms to the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act, a piece of leg-
islation that is also important to na-
tional security, that authorizes and 
funds all our intelligence activities and 
also included reforms—reforms that 
many in this body on both sides of the 
aisle wanted to see adopted. That was 
an important piece of legislation and 
one that I think has tremendous con-
sequences—I would add grave con-
sequences—for the United States of 
America and our national security in-
terests. 
The Senate has also been very in-
volved—I would suspect maybe to the 
Democratic leader’s chagrin—in exam-
ining 
and 
looking 
at 
all 
the 
coronavirus legislation that we have 
already passed and the impact it is 
having and whether it is being effective 
and where we need to do more and 
where we need to fix things or refine or 
tweak things in a way to make those 
programs that we funded and author-
ized work better. 
But to suggest that the Senate hasn’t 
done anything on the coronavirus— 
really? Really? My gosh, we passed four 
bills—four bills—totaling almost $3 
trillion 
through 
the 
U.S. 
Senate, 
through the House of Representatives, 
on the President’s desk, and signed 
into law—$3 trillion, four pieces of leg-
islation, and it was done in a bipar-
tisan way. Democrats and Republicans 
cooperated because it is important to 
our country to make sure that we are 
responding to an enormous crisis, an 
extraordinary crisis that required an 
extraordinary response, and the re-
sponse, I would argue, has been ex-
traordinary. 
Never in my lifetime or certainly my 
time in the Senate—or, for that mat-
ter, I would argue anybody else’s time 
in the Senate—has the U.S. Senate 
done anything of that scale, scope, or 
consequence. And in many of those pro-
grams that we authorized and funded, 
those four pieces of legislation which 
passed as recently as a couple of 
months ago, the dollars are still get-
ting out there. They are in the pipe-
line. They are going out to State and 
local governments. They are going out 
to 
healthcare 
providers, 
hospitals, 
nursing homes. They are going out to 
small businesses. They are going out to 
workers, employees, people who have 
been unemployed through the unem-
ployment insurance program. There 
are a lot of dollars in the pipeline, a lot 
of resources that have been expended 
by the U.S. Senate, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and signed into law by 
the President. 
So it seems logical, I would think, for 
us, as stewards of the tax dollars, as 
representatives of the people of this 
country, as policymakers, to make 
sure that the policies we are putting 
into place are having the desired effect 
and are actually working. 
So what has the Senate been doing 
for the past 3 weeks? Well, exactly 
that—taking a look on a committee- 
by-committee basis at whether some of 
the things we have already done are 
being effective. 
The Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee had in the head of 
the CDC, the head of the NIH—two 
critical agencies when it comes to 
fighting the health emergency of this 
country—to determine and to ask them 
questions about what is working, what 
is not working, what have we done, 
what should we be doing differently, 
what can we do. 
That was a hearing the Health Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
had last week, widely participated in 
by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
I sit on the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee. We have had several hearings. 
We 
had 
a 
markup 
yesterday. 
We 
marked up 14 bills yesterday, but we 
also have been looking at the impact of 
coronavirus legislation on those con-
stituencies that are under the jurisdic-
tion of the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, one of which is the airline in-
dustry. We had a hearing examining 
the impact of the coronavirus on avia-
tion, the airline industry in this coun-
try, and on things that we have done to 
help assist and support the airline in-
dustry in this country. That was an-
other thing that the Commerce Com-
mittee did. 
Then, more recently than that, we 
had 
a 
hearing 
on 
broadband, 
connectivity, and the way in which 
people, through the coronavirus, are 
able to stay connected, the way busi-
ness is conducted, and actually, frank-
ly, for that matter, the way govern-
ment is conducted because, obviously, 
we are doing a lot of things through 
connectivity as well. 
We looked at what is working, what 
is not working, and are there areas, in 
terms of making sure that parts of the 
country that don’t have high-speed 
internet services and that don’t have 
broadband services could be better con-
nected, and is that something that 
ought to be a part of any future legisla-
tion that we look at. 
This week, the Banking Committee 
had the Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve Board and had the Secretary of 
the Treasury in front of that com-
mittee to ask them questions about 
what is happening in the financial serv-
ices industry and what is the effect of 
all the money that we spent, that we 
put out the door, how is that working 
out there, and, again, what can we be 
doing differently, how can we improve, 
and how can we do this better as we 
look to the future. 
Those are just three committees, off 
the top of my head, not to mention the 
fact that the Banking Committee is 
also reporting out the nominee to be 
the inspector general for the pan-
demic—a very important position, I 
might add. So they have been very ac-
tive and very busy doing oversight 
work with respect to this pandemic. 
What the Democratic leader just said 
is not true. It is not true; it is not ac-
curate; and, frankly, I would think, in 
the eyes of the American people, it is 
illogical to say that we have spent $3 
trillion and we wouldn’t want to take a 
look to see how that $3 trillion is being 
spent and whether it is being effective 
and whether it is being efficient and 
then look at where do we need to do 
more before we rush headlong in there 
and just push another $3 trillion out 
the door. I think that is a rational way 
of looking at things. I think most of 
the American people would accept and 
believe that these are—this is what we 
were elected to do. They want to make 
sure we are taking their tax dollars 
and spending them as wisely and well 
as possible and in an efficient and ef-
fective way. 
By the way, just as a reminder to my 
colleagues, every dollar—every dollar 
that we spend is borrowed from our 
children 
and 
grandchildren. 
This 
doesn’t just magically appear out of 
thin air. We are borrowing money. 
Now, granted, it is money we needed to 
borrow, particularly with what we have 
already done. Everybody acknowledges 
we had a crisis. We had to put out the 
fire, and we have been doing that. 
Every dollar, prospectively, every 
dollar we have already spent is a bor-
rowed dollar, borrowed from future 
generations of Americans, and they are 
dollars that someday we are going to 
have to repay. Wouldn’t it be prudent, 
wouldn’t it be logical, and wouldn’t it

be 
rational 
for 
this 
body, 
the 
custodians, the stewards of the Amer-
ican people’s tax dollars, to take a hard 
look at what is working and what is 
not working before rushing headlong 
into spending another $3 trillion— 
which the Democratic leader got up 
here and lauded and applauded the 
House of Representatives for blowing 
into town for 24 hours last Friday, cob-
bling together an ideological wish list. 
Now, granted, there are some things 
in there that are probably good ideas, 
and may be things that, in the end, 
could end up in a piece of legislation, 
but it didn’t get a single Republican 
vote, and it didn’t have a single con-
sultation 
with 
Republicans in the 
House of Representatives about how to 
put it together. Do you know what? In 
the end, they couldn’t keep all the 
Democrats. There were 14 Democrats 
who voted against that in the House of 
Representatives. There was not a sin-
gle Republican, which makes sense, if 
you are Republican. You never get 
asked. You are never at the table. You 
have no input whatsoever. 
They come in and put this thing to-
gether—1,800 pages, $3 trillion—and 
what does it have in it? Crazy stuff. 
Crazy stuff like studies—studies as to 
whether there is diversity and inclu-
sion in the marketing of marijuana. 
There are 68 references in the House 
bill to cannabis. There are 68 ref-
erences. There are only 52 references to 
jobs, which is what I would think the 
American people are a lot more con-
cerned about. The House of Representa-
tives, evidently, waited, and, in the 
balance, thought: Well, my gosh, stud-
ies on the diversity and inclusiveness 
of the marketing of cannabis was more 
important and weighed more heavily 
on the scale than the jobs that have 
been lost to the American people. That 
is what it looks like. 
I mean, they threw everything in 
there. They threw in a tax cut for mil-
lionaires and billionaires. These guys 
get up here every single day and talk 
about Republicans, you know, helping 
out millionaires and billionaires, and 
what did the House bill have in it? A 
tax cut for millionaires and billion-
aires. Now, 56 percent of the tax cut 
proceeds will go to the 1 percent top 
wage earners in America. Just think 
about that. Does that make sense? 
Does that make sense when you are 
fighting a pandemic? Probably not. 
They actually have tax increases on 
small businesses. No big surprise there. 
Tax increases are always something 
they are quick to do. 
I just had to take issue with what the 
Democratic leader was down here say-
ing and his characterization of what is 
going on here. This place, when you are 
responding to a crisis, needs to act in a 
bipartisan and a constructive way, not 
in a partisan, ideological way, and I 
would also think in a thoughtful way, 
giving a lot of consideration to what 
we are doing here with those borrowed 
dollars, borrowed from our kids and 
grandkids, and are we making the best 
use of them. 
That, to me, seems like maybe the 
great divide here and the great debate 
that we have, not only in this but a lot 
of other issues. It just seems like the 
natural, instinctive solution, from my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, is 
we can just solve this by throwing a lot 
of money out there. I have to tell you, 
I don’t think that is the way the Amer-
ican people view it because they are 
sitting down and making hard deci-
sions right now about how to take care 
of their families and how to get 
through this economic crisis. I would 
think the decisions they are making 
are along the same lines of the deci-
sions we ought to be making; that is, 
how are we going to spend our dollars 
wisely and well? How are we going to 
be efficient and effective? This isn’t 
our money. This is the American peo-
ple’s money. This is a crisis that needs 
a response. We have responded in a 
massive way relative to anything that 
has happened probably in history, for 
sure in history—$2 trillion, $3 trillion. 
I mean, I can’t think of a single time— 
when we pass annual appropriations 
bills, they never get up to that level. 
We are talking about dollars on a scale 
like nothing we have ever seen before 
because that is what was required. 
This institution demonstrated that 
notwithstanding our differences, we 
could work together in a constructive 
way and a bipartisan way to do what 
was necessary to deliver for the Amer-
ican people, and we will do what is nec-
essary to get the American people 
through this crisis. Please, please, can 
we do that in a thoughtful, construc-
tive, and bipartisan way? Can we do 
that in a way that says: Wow. Let’s ac-
tually sit down and think about what 
makes the most sense here. Let’s see 
what is out there and what has actu-
ally worked. 
The Paycheck Protection Program, 
arguably, has worked really well. We 
put $660 billion into that particular 
program, and I think it has gotten 
pretty big dividends and pretty big re-
sults. A lot of businesses are still func-
tioning and still operating and a lot of 
workers are still working. That was 
what that was all about, which was to 
keep those jobs and keep those workers 
working. 
Now, there have been some hiccups, 
and there have been some things that 
need to be fixed. We ought to look at 
what we can do to refine it and make it 
work better and make it work more ef-
ficiently. The same thing is true for 
the dollars that go out to State and 
local governments. We have $150 billion 
in the pipeline that have gone out to 
State and local governments, many of 
which, I might add, are probably going 
to need help, particularly with revenue 
replacement. There are a lot of dollars 
in the pipeline out already, in addition 
to the $150 billion that we have done 
for State and local governments that 
went out in previous versions, in pre-
vious legislation. Of the four bills that 
we passed, the total sum of dollars that 
have gone to State governments is 
about $500 billion, or half a trillion dol-
lars. 
It is not just $150 billion that we put 
out. A lot of that is still in the pipe-
line. A lot of it—before we put more 
out there and before we say, oh, let’s 
put another trillion out there, which is 
what the House is proposing, maybe we 
ought to look at what the need is. 
Maybe we ought to find out what the 
revenue loss actually is because those 
numbers are just coming in. 
This thing really hit us hard a couple 
of months ago, so the real impact of 
this is going to be felt April, May, and 
into the summer. But as things start to 
open up again, hopefully, we will 
gradually climb out of this, and those 
numbers will start to improve. May 
those horrible unemployment numbers 
and those horrible revenue numbers on 
the State level, may those start to 
come—may we start to see the econ-
omy get going back in a more normal 
direction. 
Before we rush out there with an-
other several trillion—and who knows 
at what point you hit the wall when it 
comes to borrowing? I mean, we think 
that the Federal Reserve thinks it has 
lots of levers and they can leverage 
their balance sheet and they can still 
do things, and they think that, fis-
cally, we have some headroom that we 
can maneuver within, but if you think 
about this, before this all started, our 
debt-to-GDP ratio was 79 percent—79 
percent. You know what, for 2020, our 
debt-to-GDP ratio is going to be? And 
that doesn’t include anything that we 
do from here on. It just captures what 
has already been done. Our debt-to- 
GDP ratio will be 101—1 to 1. That was 
always the level when we saw the 
Greeces of the world and all these 
countries that were just completely in 
this downward spiral, this quagmire of 
debt. That was always the metric, 1 to 
1, 100 percent debt to GDP. That is the 
breakpoint. That is when you start en-
tering into that really dangerous terri-
tory. 
Well, imagine if we add another $3 
trillion on top of that. The $3 trillion 
that we have already done, taken the 
debt to GDP from 79 percent to 101 per-
cent, is the biggest increase—the big-
gest increase in debt to GDP that we 
have seen since 1943 when we were 
powering up for World War II. 
Now, granted, this is like a war. This 
is a fight that we have to win, and we 
need to do whatever it takes to win it, 
but let’s do it in a smart way, in a 
thoughtful way, and in a way that 
gives consideration to the future gen-
erations whose liability everything 
that we spend today will become, be-
cause everything that we do is bor-
rowed money, and we have to remem-
ber that. 
I came down here to talk about the 
internet, and I guess it is a speech I 
can save for another day. I was going 
to talk about China and the things that 
we need to be doing with China when it 
comes to protecting our cyber security, 
but I see my colleague from Illinois

May 21, 2020 
here is waiting to speak. I just thought 
it was important that we take a mo-
ment and pause and think about where 
we are and what we have done, and as 
we think about what we are going to do 
next, make sure we are doing it in a 
thoughtful, smart, conscientious, right 
way and efficient and effective way on 
behalf of the American people and the 
American taxpayer. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
will adjourn today and be gone next 
week for the Memorial Day recess and 
then return the following week. The 
Senate, at the request and call of the 
Senate 
Republican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL from Kentucky, has been 
in session for 3 weeks. Senator MCCON-
NELL has said that we are here because 
we need to be at our ‘‘duty stations.’’ 
He has used that term over and over 
again—a 
military 
responsibility 
to 
stay where you are assigned and to be 
prepared to fight. 
Well, those that take a look at what 
we have done over the last 3 weeks 
have to ask: Where is the battle? Where 
is the fight when it comes to COVID– 
19? The simple fact is this: The United 
States Senate, in the last 3 weeks, has 
not considered one piece of legislation 
on this floor relative to COVID–19, not 
one. It has reached the point where the 
press told me this morning that two 
Republican Senators are now com-
plaining publicly that we have done 
nothing on COVID–19 and shouldn’t 
leave for the Memorial Day recess 
until we do. 
Well, I think they ought to take 
their appeal not to the American pub-
lic but to their Republican leader be-
cause he decides what comes to the 
floor of the Senate, and he has decided, 
over the last 3 weeks, that nothing will 
come to the floor of the Senate relative 
to the biggest issue in the modern his-
tory of America: the national emer-
gency, the public health crisis over 
COVID–19. 
I listened to my friend from South 
Dakota talk about the amount of 
money that has been spent. It is an 
amazing amount—I will be the first to 
concede it—almost $3 trillion so far. It 
is the largest ever I can remember— 
well, I will just flatout say ever when 
it comes to a rescue package or a relief 
package. Of course, it comes at a time 
when we are facing the worst economic 
crisis in America for almost 100 years, 
going back to the Great Depression. 
There are 38 million uninsured Ameri-
cans. There are 1.5 million Americans 
so far infected by this virus. The 
United States, sadly, leads the world— 
leads the world—when it comes to 
these infections. I would say, when the 
President calls that a badge of honor, I 
do not. We could have done much bet-
ter. We should do much better in the 
future. 
Now, in just a matter of days—not 
sure when—we will reach the tragic 
milestone of 100,000 Americans who 
have died from the coronavirus—100,000 
Americans will have died. I join with 
the Democratic leader in saying that 
we should mark that tragic milestone 
with grief for the families and their 
loss and standing as Americans in 
honor of the sacrifice they have made. 
More than that, we need to do what 
needs to be done, and to argue that we 
have done enough now and let’s sit 
back and see what happens is to ignore 
the obvious. Jerome Powell is the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and 
he went on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ last Sunday 
and said to Congress, to the Senate, to 
the House, and to the President: Don’t 
stop doing your part. The Federal Re-
serve is trying to loan money to create 
opportunities to rebuild this economy, 
but we need to do our part. He didn’t 
say the $3 trillion is all in. He basically 
said we need to do more. 
We had a briefing from Mark Zandi, 
an economist, in the last day or two. 
He is well respected. He has been an 
economist advising both Democrats 
and Republicans, and he said the same. 
If we don’t move and move quickly and 
decisively and boldly to restore this 
economy, what is now a recession, 
could be much, much worse. That 
means, of course, helping those fami-
lies who have already been hurt. 
Last Friday, the House of Represent-
atives did pass another measure for re-
lief, another effort to deal with the 
COVID virus. So while we have been 
here for 3 weeks and haven’t brought 
one single bill to the floor on the 
COVID virus—not one—they moved for-
ward last Friday and passed, without 
the cooperation of any Republicans— 
they passed a measure to deal with the 
continuing crisis in America. 
Let me say at the outset, I don’t 
agree with every provision in that bill. 
I know that negotiations are likely to 
follow, and the compromise is likely to 
produce a work product that is some-
what different, but let’s look at what 
that bill did. 
The Senator from South Dakota 
came to the floor and said that bill did 
crazy stuff. He repeated it—crazy stuff. 
Well, let’s talk about what the bill did. 
What the bill did was to restore the 
President’s cash payment to families. 
You remember that well, I am sure, 
supported by both political parties. It 
was $1,200 for each adult and $500 for 
each child. It was absolutely necessary 
for families who are struggling to get 
by. 
In the House version that passed last 
Friday, there was a renewed cash pay-
ment of $1,200 for adults and $1,200 for 
children. The amount of money we ini-
tially allocated for this has been all 
but spent at this point, so this is an 
area where we believe, as Democrats, 
families still need a helping hand. Why 
do the Republicans in the Senate insist 
on not bringing this measure to the 
floor of the U.S. Senate or at least into 
meaningful negotiation? Do they be-
lieve that families across America have 
received all the money they need to re-
ceive to get through this crisis? I don’t. 
If they do, they are out of touch. 
The second thing this bill did was to 
extend the unemployment compensa-
tion. Remember, there are 38 million 
and counting unemployed Americans. 
We created, in the CARES Act, a Fed-
eral boost for unemployment benefits. 
So if you qualified for unemployment 
benefits from your State, you would re-
ceive an additional $600 a week. I think 
that was necessary and good for the 
economy, and for the families affected, 
it was a lifeline they desperately need-
ed. But that program, the $600 a week, 
expires on July 31—expires. Is there 
anyone who believes we will be through 
this economic crisis by July 31 when 
everyone will be back to work? Of 
course not. We need to continue to help 
those families. 
The bill that passed the House of 
Representatives, which the Republican 
Senator calls crazy stuff—what the bill 
did was to extend that Federal unem-
ployment benefit of $600 a week until 
the end of this year. I think that is sen-
sible and reasonable. 
I might tell you that we expanded 
the categories of those eligible for em-
ployment too. Many independent con-
tractors finally get the chance to get 
some help at this point in time. So to 
call that crazy stuff and to not even 
consider it on the floor of the Senate 
makes no sense at all. 
What about the Payroll Protection 
Program? That was one for small busi-
ness loans that could be forgiven if the 
money was loaned and spent for spe-
cific purposes. There is a reason we had 
to revisit that. The money had to be 
spent by the businesses by the end of 
June—June 30. I can tell you, having 
spoken 
to 
many 
small 
businesses 
across the State of Illinois, that some 
of them will not even be open for busi-
ness by June 30. Requiring them to 
spend money before they can open 
their doors doesn’t give them an oppor-
tunity to use this money to really get 
back in business. 
There were revisions made in the 
measure the House passed last Friday, 
revisions in terms of the period of time 
that the business had to spend the 
money. Under the current setup, it is 8 
weeks. We think that should be ex-
tended to a longer period of time. Is 
that crazy stuff? I think, from where I 
am standing, it just makes common 
sense that we would do something that 
basic. Yet the Senate Republican lead-
er has refused to bring that matter to 
the floor of the Senate in the weeks 
since it was passed, and there is obvi-
ously no meaningful negotiation under-
way, and we are leaving to be gone for 
another week. 
But the largest measure in the bill 
that passed the House of Representa-
tives included a provision to help State 
and local governments. My friend and 
colleague from South Dakota talked 
about the $150 billion that has been 
given to State and local governments, 
which, in the end, could be even larger. 
I would say to him: Don’t listen to me. 
Listen to the National Governors Asso-
ciation. Ask Governor Hogan, a Repub-
lican from Maryland, if we are all in

and have done enough for State and 
local governments? We are not even 
close. We are not even close, and we 
know it. 
Lost revenue by my State and many 
others is dramatic. So what happens if 
these States don’t have the money to 
pay their bills? Well, Senator MCCON-
NELL, in an interview, said: Bank-
ruptcy—bankruptcy is an option. Real-
ly? Does he believe we are going to re-
store this economy by watching State 
and local governments go bankrupt? 
What will be the net result of the 
MCCONNELL’s suggestion of bankruptcy 
for these State and local governments? 
It will mean laying off, perhaps firing, 
policemen, firefighters, EMTs, para-
medics, and teachers. At a time when 
we need to restore our educational cal-
endar, bring students back to school, 
the Senator from Kentucky suggested 
bankruptcy, laying off teachers, and 
firing teachers. It makes no sense 
whatsoever. 
The bill that passed the House of 
Representatives has roughly $1 trillion 
for State and local governments. So I 
can tell you, across my State and I am 
sure across this Nation, Governors and 
mayors will step forward and tell you 
that is exactly what they need now to 
get back in business. 
Remember, as Senator MURRAY said 
in response to another suggestion, 
building a bridge halfway across a river 
is not of much value. We need to build 
a bridge in this economy from where 
we are today to where we want to be, 
with small businesses opening and peo-
ple back at work, and the notion that 
we can shortchange parts of this econ-
omy and survive is just wrong. 
There is a provision in that bill in 
the House, too, that I introduced in the 
Senate. It is not an original idea, but 
others have thought of it too. A third 
of the people who lose their jobs lose 
their health insurance because that is 
where their health insurance came 
from. Their employer used to pay a 
share, and they paid a share, and they 
were covered with good policies. But 
when they lost their job, the next day, 
they lost their insurance. What were 
their options? Sign up for the Afford-
able Care Act, which covers about 20 
million Americans; perhaps qualifying 
for Medicaid if their family income is 
low enough; or using what is known as 
the COBRA Program? The COBRA Pro-
gram says you can keep that policy 
you had at your place of employment; 
however, you now are personally re-
sponsible for both ends of the premium 
payment, the employer and the em-
ployee. Well, that comes out to about 
$1,700 a month. Imagine that for an un-
employed person—$1,700 a month in 
premium. They can’t do it. So what I 
proposed, and what was included in the 
bill that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, was 100-percent coverage 
for 
that 
premium 
payment 
under 
COBRA so that these families would 
have the peace of mind that they would 
continue to have health insurance dur-
ing the course of this crisis. 
I have given you some highlights of 
what this bill did. I would just suggest 
and challenge those who call this crazy 
stuff to come to the floor and be more 
specific. What part of what I just de-
scribed is crazy stuff—extended COBRA 
protection for more health insurance 
for those who are unemployed, extend-
ing unemployment benefits for the re-
mainder of the year, extending the pe-
riod of payback for small business 
loans, making sure, as well, that there 
is more money for hospitals? 
I will just state that I have been on 
the telephone for the last several 
weeks with the administrators of hos-
pitals all over the State of Illinois, 
large and small, and I have joined them 
with my Republican Members of the 
House and Democratic Members. We 
have called and opened the lines and 
said: What are you finding? Many of 
these hospitals in the inner cities, as 
well as those in rural and smalltown 
areas in States across the Midwest are 
struggling to survive. 
Yesterday I read a list of six hos-
pitals in Kentucky that were fur-
loughing hundreds of employees. In 
most of the communities downstate 
where we have hospitals in Illinois, 
they are the major employer, and these 
hospitals are hanging on by a thread. 
What is wrong? A lot of COVID virus 
cases? No, just a fear of COVID virus. 
One hospital administrator said: We 
have four elective surgeries scheduled 
for money, and, Senator, that is where 
our revenue comes in to keep this hos-
pital going. Three of the four patients 
canceled at the last minute. They were 
afraid of the COVID virus. 
The bill that passed the House of 
Representatives last week had another 
$100 million for hospitals. I will tell 
you flatout that there is a sense of ur-
gency there because if you lose—if you 
lose that community hospital, it is a 
grievous loss in many parts of our 
State, in the rural areas and small 
towns in particular. Yet we have not 
even brought that issue up on the floor 
of the Senate over the last 3 weeks. 
We have a lot of work that needs to 
be done. We didn’t do it in the last 3 
weeks. We considered two circuit court 
nominees before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. One from the State of Ken-
tucky is a fellow who has 6 months’ ex-
perience on the Federal bench. He is 
being proposed by Senator MCCONNELL 
for a lifetime appointment in the sec-
ond highest court in the land. Really? 
That is the best Republican nominee 
for the second highest court in the 
land, a man with 6 months’ experience 
as a trial judge? He does have one thing 
in his favor, from Senator MCCON-
NELL’s point of view: He is completely 
opposed to the Affordable Care Act. 
They came up with another nominee 
from Mississippi yesterday with the 
same thing. So they have two nominees 
in the midst of a public health crisis in 
America who are asking for lifetime 
appointments to the court who are op-
posed to the Affordable Care Act, a 
measure that extended health insur-
ance coverage to 20 million Americans 
and provides protections for over 100 
million Americans in terms of their 
own personal policies, really making 
sure that those with preexisting condi-
tions have coverage they can afford. At 
this moment in time, the Republican 
Party came up with two lifetime nomi-
nees who are opposed to the extension 
of health insurance in America. The 
timing is perfect. 
If you look up the whole question of 
relevance, and you ask: What is the 
most irrelevant thing that has oc-
curred in the midst of this crisis? It is 
the last 3 weeks of the U.S. Senate. We 
have been here and put at risk 10,000 
employees, which is the scale of our 
workforce in the U.S. Capitol. We have 
put them at risk. To come here and 
never 
mention 
the 
words 
‘‘COVID 
virus’’ or ‘‘coronavirus’’ or ‘‘pandemic’’ 
in legislation on the floor of the Senate 
is disgraceful. 
We were elected to serve. We were 
elected to respond to America’s needs. 
For the last 3 weeks on the floor the 
Senate, we have not. The random com-
mittee hearing—good. That is what we 
are supposed to do. That is normal. But 
you would think that Senator MCCON-
NELL would have decided, as the House 
decided last week, that this is still the 
No. 1 priority in America. It should be. 
Perhaps after we return from the Me-
morial Day recess, there will be a sense 
of urgency, which, sadly, does not exist 
on the Republican side of the aisle of 
the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 50 
minutes we are voting to confirm the 
nominee as Director of National Intel-
ligence. Today, I want to discuss Con-
gressman RATCLIFFE’s confirmation as 
Director of National intelligence. 
I want to congratulate that Con-
gressman on a job well done. With this 
new position comes great responsi-
bility. Congressman RATCLIFFE
will 
have tremendous power to do good and 
to be transparent. 
I would like to remind Congressman 
RATCLIFFE, as I have reminded many 
heads of departments before, trans-
parency brings accountability, and the 
public’s business ought to be public. 
By its very nature, the intelligence 
community is a secretive bunch. They 
often operate in the shadows and have 
to in order to do the job that we ask 
them to do to protect our national se-
curity. 
However, that doesn’t mean when 
Congress asks them questions, the in-
telligence community has a license to 
withhold information. 
When Congress comes knocking, the 
intelligence community must answer. 
After all, the intelligence community 
does not appear anywhere in the Con-
stitution. The intelligence community 
is a creation of Congress; Congress 
isn’t a creation of the intelligence

May 21, 2020 
community. The intelligence commu-
nity answers to us and, in turn, to the 
American people. 
Acting Director Grenell, now in that 
position as acting, understood that. He 
is perhaps one of the most transparent 
government officials in my time serv-
ing the great people of Iowa. 
Ambassador Grenell is a breath of 
fresh air. Mr. RATCLIFFE has some big 
shoes to fill; that is for sure. Luckily, 
he has Acting Director Grenell’s exam-
ple to guide him. 
Mr. Grenell’s short time as Acting 
Director has resulted in a number of 
very important items being declas-
sified. For example, he and Attorney 
General Barr declassified dozens of 
footnotes from the Justice Depart-
ment’s inspector general’s report that 
show how the Department of Justice 
and the FBI mishandled the Russian 
investigation. 
To give some highlights of what 
those previously classified footnotes 
show, let me go through six or seven of 
them. 
One, the Russian intelligence was 
aware of Steele’s anti-Trump research 
in early July 2016, before the FBI 
opened 
Crossfire 
Hurricane. 
That 
means the Russians knew they could 
possibly use the Steele dossier as a ve-
hicle to plant disinformation and sow 
chaos to undermine the American Gov-
ernment. 
Two, the FBI had an open counter-
intelligence 
case 
on 
Steele’s 
key 
source, but they failed to give that in-
formation to the FISA Court. 
The FBI had intelligence that some 
of Steele’s sources had connections to 
Russian intelligence. That is point 
three. 
Point four, Steele had sources con-
nected to the Presidential administra-
tion, and some supported Clinton, not 
Trump. 
Five, the Crossfire Hurricane team 
was aware in late January 2017 that 
Russian intelligence may have targeted 
Orbis. Orbis is Steele’s company. 
Six, 
Steele’s 
primary 
subsource 
viewed his or her contacts not as a net-
work of sources but, rather, as simply 
friends that discussed current events. 
Seven, two intelligence reports—one 
from January 12, 2017, the other from 
February 27, 2017—indicated that infor-
mation contained within the Steele 
dossier was a product of Russian 
disinformation. This information was 
withheld from the FISA Court, and the 
FBI continued to use the Steele dossier 
to justify surveillance on Carter Page. 
I also want to note a very interesting 
fact about the January 12, 2017, date. 
Not only did the FBI learn that the 
dossier, their ‘‘central and essential’’ 
document, was most likely filled with 
this Russian disinformation, they then 
failed to inform the FISA Court about 
it on the very same day that the FBI 
got the FISA renewal on Carter Page. 
Do you know what? It was renewed two 
more times. 
My fellow Americans, what the FBI 
did is a complete travesty. You have to 
ask yourselves: Why did they do it? 
Well, the text messages from Strzok 
and Page that I made public help us 
better understand that question. Their 
animus toward Trump helped to ex-
plain why the FBI employees cut cor-
ners and didn’t follow regular protocol 
in running their inquiry. 
As I have mentioned before, Strzok’s 
text to Page about how he will ‘‘stop’’ 
Trump from becoming President is 
very telling. But thanks to Acting Di-
rector Grenell and Attorney General 
Barr, these texts can now be read in a 
greater context. 
For example, on August 15, 2016, 
Strzok texts Page: 
I want to believe the path that you threw 
out for consideration in Andy’s office— 
And that was referring to Andrew 
McCabe— 
that there’s no way Trump gets elected—but 
I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like 
an insurance policy in the unlikely event 
you die before you’re 40. 
The next day, on August 16, 2016, the 
FBI opened the Flynn probe, code- 
named Crossfire Razor. 
On August 17, 2016, the FBI used a 
briefing for Trump, who was now the 
Republican nominee, and Flynn to sur-
veil Flynn for his ‘‘mannerisms’’—what 
is said about it, I don’t know—and 
whether he mentioned anything about 
Russia. 
Let’s also not forget about the text 
from November 2016 that Senator JOHN-
SON and I made public. Those texts be-
tween Strzok and Page show that the 
FBI used a November 2016 briefing for 
Presidential transition staff as a coun-
terintelligence operation. 
For example, Strzok told Page: 
He can assess if there are any new ques-
tions or different demeanor. If Katie’s hus-
band is there, he can see if there are people 
we can develop for potential relationships. 
That is an astounding finding. Imag-
ine if that had been done by the Demo-
cratic nominee. You wouldn’t hear the 
end of it. In fact, they would probably 
call for another special counsel. Yet 
because it is Trump and Flynn, the 
media has gone largely quiet. 
On January 4, 2017, the FBI wrote a 
closing memorandum on Flynn that 
said the intelligence community could 
find no derogatory information on him. 
That should have been the end of it. 
Yet on the very same day that the 
FBI was ready to close the Flynn case, 
Strzok asked another FBI agent: ‘‘Hey, 
if you haven’t closed Razor don’t do it 
yet.’’ The case was still open at that 
moment and Strzok asked that it be 
kept open ‘‘for now.’’ 
Strzok then messaged Lisa Page, say-
ing that Razor still happened to be 
open because of some oversight and 
said: ‘‘Yeah, our utter incompetence 
actually helps us. 20 percent of the 
time.’’ 
Then the next day, on January 5, 
2017, President Obama met with Direc-
tor Comey, Deputy Attorney General 
Sally Yates, Vice President Biden, and 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice. 
In that meeting, they briefed Obama on 
the Russia investigation. 
On January 5, 2017, the very same day 
as the Oval Office briefing with Obama 
and Biden, an Obama administration 
official leaked the existence of the De-
cember 29, 2016, Flynn call with the 
Russian Ambassador. However, that 
leak hadn’t yet been publicly reported. 
Also on January 5, Obama’s Chief of 
Staff requested to unmask Flynn. Ac-
cording to Deputy Attorney General 
Yates, when she met with Obama on 
that day, Obama already knew about 
Flynn’s call with the Russian Ambas-
sador. She was surprised that Obama 
knew about it already. 
On January 11, 2017, U.N. Ambassador 
Samantha Power requested to unmask 
Flynn. She requested this be done 
seven times after the election. She 
ought to explain why she did that. 
Then on January 12, 2017, Vice Presi-
dent Biden requested to unmask Flynn. 
That 
same 
day, 
the 
existence 
of 
Flynn’s call with the Russian Ambas-
sador was leaked and ran in the Wash-
ington Post. 
Then, in February 2017, the alleged 
contents of the call were leaked. Those 
leaks are a criminal action. They are 
some of the many criminal leaks that 
occurred during the transition period 
and, also, the early days of the Trump 
administration, which were obviously 
designed to undermine the new admin-
istration. I assume U.S. Attorney Dur-
ham is investigating all of those leaks. 
With respect to the unmasking, what 
I would like to know is, Why did so 
many Obama administration officials 
who were not within the intelligence 
field request to unmask Flynn? The 
sheer volume of unmasking and the 
timing cause me to question whether it 
was politically motivated. 
Based on the facts that we now know, 
it appears that the Obama administra-
tion’s top law enforcement agency, as 
well as the intelligence community, 
engaged in a coordinated effort to cut 
the legs from under the Trump admin-
istration before they could even get 
their footing. The American people 
have had to suffer through years of 
criminal leaks, innuendos, false news 
reports, and flatout lies—all designed 
to destroy the Trump administration. 
The Russian investigation should have 
closed shop early on, especially when 
the people they surveilled from the 
Trump campaign offered exculpatory 
evidence—evidence which showed that 
the Trump campaign wasn’t involved 
in the Democratic National Committee 
hack and didn’t have the Russian con-
nections the FBI thought they had. By 
the way, that evidence was hidden from 
the FISA Court by the FBI. 
Obama has said DOJ and FBI must be 
kept independent of White House inter-
ference. Yet, based on information that 
we have at this point, it appears that 
he and Biden were much more involved 
in aspects of the Russia investigation 
than they would like to have us be-
lieve. 
Ultimately, Obama and Biden will 
have to answer for what they knew and 
when they knew it. That shouldn’t be a

problem for the so-called most trans-
parent administration in history, as 
they used to tell us all the time. 
Simply said, heads need to roll over 
this. If they don’t, the intelligence 
community, the Department of Jus-
tice, and the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation may never get the people’s 
trust. 
Where do we go from here? On May 
12, 2020, I wrote a letter to Acting Di-
rector Grenell that requested a broad 
range of information relating to un-
masking by the Obama administration. 
On May 19, I expanded that request 
with Senator JOHNSON. Prior to that, I 
wrote to the Justice Department and 
Mr. Grenell, requesting that the tran-
scripts of Flynn’s calls with the Rus-
sian Ambassador and Susan Rice’s infa-
mous January 20, 2017, email to herself 
be declassified, among other things. 
That email has now been declassified 
and casts further doubts on the FBI’s 
actions. 
I have also requested, along with 
Senator JOHNSON, underlying intel-
ligence reports from the Russia inves-
tigation. Moreover, reports suggest 
that the Obama administration un-
masked a lot more U.S. persons related 
to the Trump campaign than just Gen-
eral Flynn. 
The responsibility to respond to 
these requests will now fall on Con-
gressman RATCLIFFE. Hopefully, he is 
as helpful to congressional oversight 
and public accountability as Ambas-
sador Grenell. Let’s see it all. The 
American 
public 
has 
waited 
long 
enough. 
Finally, I want to remind Congress-
man RATCLIFFE
and the intelligence 
community of the hold I placed on Wil-
liam Evanina. I did that 2 years ago. I 
placed that hold in my capacity as 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
I have explained in detail many 
times before why I placed a hold on 
him, and I am not going to bother ex-
plaining it again, other than to men-
tion that Deputy Attorney General 
Rosenstein agreed to give me the docu-
ments, and he never did. In turn, Gen-
eral Rosenstein blamed Director Coats, 
who then blamed Rosenstein. 
You have heard it before—all of my 
colleagues have. Whether you have a 
Republican or Democratic administra-
tion, it is your typical bureaucratic 
blame game. Thanks to Acting Direc-
tor Grenell and Attorney General Barr, 
the blame game has ended. 
But, importantly, especially for fu-
ture administrations and for Congress-
man RATCLIFFE, I want to make very 
clear that the Judiciary Committee’s 
jurisdiction extends to the intelligence 
community. Since the authorization 
resolution that created the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence, the 
Senate explicitly reserved for other 
standing committees, such as the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, independent 
authority to ‘‘study and review any in-
telligence activity’’ and ‘‘to obtain full 
and prompt access to the product of 
the intelligence activities of any de-
partment or agency’’ when such activ-
ity ‘‘directly affects a matter other-
wise within the jurisdiction of such 
committee.’’ 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has 
jurisdiction over all Federal courts, in-
cluding the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Court, where a lot of intel-
ligence activity takes place. Of course, 
all of Congress, not just any one com-
mittee or any one Senator, has the 
constitutional authority over the intel-
ligence community. 
In conclusion, please, Congressman 
RATCLIFFE and, please, the greater in-
telligence community, remember you 
were created by statute, but Congress 
was created by the Constitution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes, the Senate is going to vote on 
the nomination of JOHN RATCLIFFE to 
be Director of National Intelligence. I 
have come to the floor to discuss this 
important nomination. 
Senators often come to this floor to 
talk about the importance of speaking 
truth to power. JOHN RATCLIFFE, in his 
statement before the Intelligence Com-
mittee and in his written responses, re-
vealed he would not speak truth to 
power; he would surrender to it. He 
demonstrated that he is so eager to 
serve power, he will twist the truth, 
and he showed this again and again. 
For example, in the name of helping 
power, we saw him dance around direct 
questions about whether he would re-
spect or even understood the law. JOHN 
RATCLIFFE
made a number of ex-
tremely disturbing statements that 
make it clear that he has and will mis-
represent and politicize intelligence 
without a moment’s hesitation. 
I asked the Congressman at his hear-
ing about a law that requires a public, 
unclassified report on who was respon-
sible for the murder of the Washington 
Post 
journalist 
and 
U.S. 
resident, 
Jamal Khashoggi. This was a law 
passed by the Congress and signed by 
the President of the United States. 
This law required the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence to produce that un-
classified report on who killed Jamal 
Khashoggi and what the circumstances 
were in February. That has never hap-
pened. 
At his nomination hearing, I simply 
asked the Congressman whether the 
government was bound by the law. In 
his response, the Congressman called 
the law a request for unclassified infor-
mation. That is how he referred to this 
law. Then the Congressman promised 
to take a look at it. In his own words, 
JOHN RATCLIFFE wouldn’t commit to 
following that important law without 
knowing the circumstances of who 
killed Jamal Khashoggi. I believe it is 
open season on journalists. 
How JOHN RATCLIFFE danced around 
that question of whether he would 
comply with the law is a disqualifica-
tion by itself to be the head of national 
intelligence. 
This was a pattern throughout the 
hearing. JOHN RATCLIFFE had his talk-
ing points down, but the moment he 
was asked anything specific, he danced 
away. I am just going to take a few 
minutes to give some examples. Obvi-
ously, it is critically important to 
know a nominee’s views for this posi-
tion on the question of spying on 
Americans. 
I asked JOHN RATCLIFFE three times 
in prehearing questions, at the hearing, 
and again after the hearing, whether 
the statute that prohibits warrantless 
wiretapping on Americans was binding. 
Each time, JOHN RATCLIFFE left him-
self lots of wiggle room to suggest that 
whatever this law said, the President 
might have ways to go around it. He 
also said he would work with the At-
torney General, who we know has ex-
plicitly said that he doesn’t believe the 
foreign intelligence surveillance law is 
binding on the President. 
This is really where JOHN RATCLIFFE 
could 
be 
dangerous. 
With 
Donald 
Trump as President and William Barr 
as Attorney General, the leadership of 
the intelligence community is one of 
democracy’s last lines of defense. That 
is why the American people need a Di-
rector of National Intelligence who un-
derstands how the law protects their 
rights and won’t start conducting 
warrantless wiretapping on Americans 
just because the Attorney General 
wrongly claims that it is legal. 
Nothing that JOHN
RATCLIFFE
has 
said during his confirmation process or 
throughout his career provides a glim-
mer of hope that he is a person who 
would speak truth to power and stand 
up for the rights of Americans. 
There are plenty more reasons to op-
pose this nomination, but in the inter-
est of time, I am going to focus on just 
one more, and that is JOHN RATCLIFFE’s 
blatant misrepresentation and politi-
cizing of intelligence. This was obvious 
in how he talked about the intelligence 
community’s assessment that the Rus-
sians interfered in the 2016 election to 
help Donald Trump. This is a view un-
disputed within the intelligence com-
munity. The Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee looked at it up and down, and it 
was the unanimous judgment of the In-
telligence Committee that it was true. 
Yet for JOHN RATCLIFFE, the intel-
ligence really doesn’t matter. All that 
matters is that he makes Donald 
Trump happy. If Donald Trump doesn’t 
want to acknowledge that the Russians 
helped him, then those are JOHN 
RATCLIFFE’s marching orders. 
It is the exact opposite of speaking 
truth to power and that is why, at the 
beginning of my remarks, I described 
his views with respect to power as not 
speaking truth but totally surren-
dering to power. 
He is also perfectly happy to mis-
represent the intelligence even when it 
is public and we can read it with our 
own eyes. Three times during his hear-
ing, he said that the Russians did not 
succeed in changing the outcome of the 
2016 election. This position of JOHN

RATCLIFFE
directly contradicts what 
the Intelligence community had writ-
ten in plain English. It said: ‘‘We did 
not make an assessment of the impact 
that Russian activities had on the out-
come of the 2016 election.’’ So I asked 
JOHN RATCLIFFE where he got his infor-
mation. He referred back to the Intel-
ligence community’s assessment and 
the committee’s report, neither of 
which 
supported 
JOHN
RATCLIFFE’s 
statements. 
You have to ask yourself, Why would 
JOHN RATCLIFFE say something that is 
obviously not true? That is because 
Donald Trump wants us to believe that 
he didn’t benefit from Russian inter-
ference, and that, first and foremost, is 
what matters to JOHN RATCLIFFE. If 
JOHN RATCLIFFE is willing to misrepre-
sent intelligence assessments that are 
already public that anybody can read 
for themselves, my take is there is no 
telling how he would misrepresent in-
telligence that is still classified. 
There is every reason to believe his 
public statements would be designed 
for one purpose and one purpose only, 
and that is to make sure that Donald 
Trump is pleased. Neither the Congress 
nor the American people have any rea-
son to trust that JOHN RATCLIFFE’s tes-
timony or his other public statements 
are accurate. 
My view is this kind of approach 
taken by the Director of National In-
telligence is a real threat to democ-
racy. When the Director of National In-
telligence demonstrates that he is will-
ing to bury the actual intelligence and 
say whatever makes Donald Trump 
happy at any particular moment, the 
American people are going to lose con-
fidence and lose confidence quickly. 
It is not just about foreign inter-
ference in our democracy. That is plen-
ty serious as it is. It is about other 
threats from countries like Iran, North 
Korea, and China. It is about weapons 
of mass destruction and terrorism. It is 
about whether the government is se-
cretly spying on Americans without a 
warrant or committing torture. Ulti-
mately, it is about the issue of war and 
peace and whether Americans will be 
asked to die for our country. 
The American people look to intel-
ligence leaders for the facts—the facts, 
the unvarnished truth on these and 
other issues, which is why it is so im-
portant this position must have a foun-
dation of credibility. 
Time and again, JOHN RATCLIFFE has 
demonstrated that he does not clear 
that lowest bar; that bar that means 
you have to have credibility in this po-
sition, and I urge my colleagues, when 
we vote in a few minutes, to reject 
JOHN RATCLIFFE’s nomination to be Di-
rector of National Intelligence.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
John Leonard Badalamenti, of Florida, 
to be United States District Judge for 
the Middle District of Florida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, with respect to the 
Ratcliffe nomination, the motion to re-
consider is considered made and laid 
upon the table, and the President will 
be immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
know that we are all looking forward 
to trying to finish our legislative work 
this week. The majority leader has an-
nounced that next week the Senate 
will be in recess for the traditional Me-
morial Day recess. 
Let me just urge our colleagues that 
before we leave for the recess, we need 
to act on the challenges that COVID–19 
is imposing on our State and local gov-
ernments. To me, it would be irrespon-
sible for us to leave and go into recess 
recognizing that our State and local 
governments are so much impacted by 
COVID–19. 
They are making decisions now. They 
have to put their budgets together. 
They have to adjust this year’s budget 
and plan for next year’s budget. What 
is in the balance? Well, it is our mu-
nicipalities, it is law enforcement, it is 
police, it is fire, it is emergency rescue. 
For our counties, it is our schools and 
funding of our schools. It also deals 
with public health for our State. It is 
public health and so many other dif-
ferent issues that are dependent upon 
the State having the resources in order 
to respond to the needs of their citi-
zens—our constituents—as well as to 
deal with the challenges of COVID–19. 
I will give you one example on that. 
This week, by teleconference with rep-
resentatives of our higher education, 
University of Maryland—they depend 
very much on the revenues they get 
from the State and the revenues they 
get from their students. Both are very 
much in jeopardy today. The least we 
can do is to make sure that the States 
have the resources to continue these 
critical missions. They just don’t have 
it. 
Let me give you some of the numbers 
so that my colleagues are aware of it. 
For the State of Maryland, in the rev-
enue projections for the current fiscal 
year that ends June 30, the revenues 
will be off by as much as $925 million to 
$1.25 billion. Those are revenue losses. 
On top of that, their fiscal year 2022 
revenue projection is another loss of 
$2.1 to $2.4 billion. That is for the State 
of Maryland. Those are not our subdivi-
sions. 
Baltimore City is projecting a reduc-
tion in revenues by $141 million this 
year. That is going to require layoffs. 
They have already talked about layoffs 
and not hiring additional police offi-
cers. Those police officers are needed in 
order to keep Baltimore safe. We know 
the challenges we have in our munic-
ipal centers, and Baltimore City is

under a consent order decree. That is 
being jeopardized by the inability of 
Baltimore to deal with these costs. 
They have to balance their budget. 
The State of Maryland has to balance 
its budget. Baltimore City has to bal-
ance its budget. It doesn’t have the lee-
way we have in order to respond to a 
crisis by pumping money at a problem. 
Baltimore County has a $172 million 
revenue projection. That is a 22-percent 
reduction in this year’s budget in re-
gard to income tax revenues alone. 
They have a 70-percent reduction in 
motel and hotel tax revenues. 
For Montgomery County, our neigh-
bor that borders DC, there is a $250 mil-
lion projected revenue loss for this 
year. Prince George’s County has a $134 
million revenue loss for this year, and 
that includes a reduction of $886 mil-
lion in income tax revenues. Anne 
Arundel County anticipates a $63 mil-
lion loss of revenue. They have frozen 
all positions. Howard County projects a 
$30 to $40 million loss of revenue. They 
normally have a growth of $25 million. 
That is a swing of $55 million to $65 
million for a county that wasn’t large 
enough to get direct help under the 
CARES Act. 
I mention the CARES Act because it 
was an important bill. When we first 
took it up, it did not include a robust 
provision for State and local. We put 
that in on the Senate floor, and we are 
pleased we were able to do that. It is 
limited. It is limited because the 
money that we made available under 
the CARES Act provided help to State 
and local governments on their direct 
costs associated with COVID–19. That 
money has been used for direct costs 
associated with COVID–19. 
I have already pointed out the rev-
enue losses in the State of Maryland 
and in our subdivisions. The CARES 
Act doesn’t provide any help in regard 
to making up for the revenue losses. 
The CARES Act went only to jurisdic-
tions of 500,000 or more—over 500,000. 
Only a few of our counties were eligi-
ble for help in my State. Most of our 
counties were not eligible for help di-
rectly. They had to apply through the 
State, but they were not eligible for di-
rect help. 
Let 
me 
give 
you 
one 
county: 
Wicomico County, Eastern Shore of 
Maryland. That is where the poultry 
processing plants are located. That is 
where the problems of COVID–19 need-
ed to be contained. We did not provide 
any direct help to Wicomico County in 
regard to stabilization funds. That was 
wrong. 
As we all know, we treated our host 
jurisdiction here, the District of Co-
lumbia, wrongly by not allowing them 
to get the same minimum distribution 
as a State. The CARES Act helped, but 
it didn’t deal with the current crisis 
that we now find at State and local 
governments. 
The Governors have issued a bipar-
tisan plea. Governor Hogan, who is the 
chair of the National Governors Asso-
ciation, the Republican Governor from 
Maryland, and Governor Cuomo, the 
Democratic Governor from New York, 
have joined with all of our Governors 
in saying that they need help now from 
the Federal Government in order to 
maintain critical missions of public 
safety, of public health, of education 
and, yes, to meet the direct needs re-
lated to COVID–19. They need help 
now. Yes, we need to respond. 
I am pleased that there is a bipar-
tisan group of Senators who have filed 
the SMART Act. The Governors say 
they need $500 billion in order to get 
through this immediate crisis—$500 bil-
lion more. Well, the SMART Act pro-
vides $500 billion. Two-thirds would go 
to the State and one-third to the local 
governments. That is an important 
start, but we could do better than that. 
The HEROES Act, the bill that 
passed the House of Representatives, 
provides $875 billion, and 57 percent 
goes to the States, meeting what the 
States need; that is, basically the 
States’ needs. And 42 percent goes to 
local governments, half to the coun-
ties, half to municipalities over 50,000. 
That would go a long way to meeting 
the needs of our local first responders, 
our police, our fire, our emergency res-
cue, our schools. Those types of issues 
could be addressed under that need. 
We have to respond. We just can’t go 
home and say that this is not our prob-
lem. These are our constituents. They 
depend upon local police and fire. They 
depend upon our schools being prepared 
to educate their children. They depend 
upon sanitation being collected. They 
depend upon the public health capac-
ities. That is where they get those 
services. If we don’t provide the where-
withal under the balanced budget rules, 
they are not going to be able to provide 
those essential services. 
My plea is that before we go into re-
cess, let us take up at least the issues 
affecting State and local governments 
and do something to help so that they 
can continue to provide essential serv-
ices to our constituents and they can 
deal with the direct costs associated 
with COVID–19 in their communities. 
As we are beginning to reopen our 
communities, we need to make sure 
our State and local governments have 
the resources to respond to the chal-
lenges when more people are getting 
together. We also need to respond if we 
are going to get our economy back on 
track. It is not going to get back on 
track if our State and local govern-
ments are laying off their workers. We 
need to respond in a positive way, and 
we need to do that now. 
I urge my colleagues to take up legis-
lation before we go into recess in order 
to help the people of our Nation 
through our State and local govern-
ments. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded.

dered.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we have 
seen things in the pandemic crisis that 
nobody in living memory has dealt 
with. In so many ways we are writing 
the book and trying to read the book 
at the same time, trying to figure out 
how we get to where we need to be.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2575 
May 21, 2020 
Clearly there has been an incredible 
strain on the American economy and 
an incredible strain on the American 
healthcare system and everybody in-
volved with that. 
Public health experts told us we had 
to flatten the curve, and the economic 
cost of flattening the curve was pretty 
great. On the other side of that equa-
tion, the impact on hospitals was sig-
nificant in that many of them have 
been ready and waiting for whatever 
they needed to do, and because we flat-
tened the curve, the worst-case sce-
narios didn’t occur, and in most cases 
they were prevented, and we had plenty 
of hospital beds. Before it was over, we 
had ventilators and all those things we 
will have later. 
But the crisis, because of flattening 
the curve, has certainly lasted longer 
and will last longer than it would have 
otherwise. I am not saying that is a 
bad thing; I am just saying measures 
like closing businesses and sending 
people home from work, practicing so-
cial distancing, putting people on the 
unemployment rolls have really cre-
ated serious problems for people who 
have cause to have challenges to their 
mental well-being. 
I think the impact is that nearly half 
the adults in the United States say 
that the coronavirus has impacted 
their mental health. This is on top of 
the statistic we traditionally believe 
from the National Institutes of Health 
and other places that one out of four or 
one out of five adult Americans has a 
diagnosable—and I wouldn’t hesitate to 
add an almost always treatable behav-
ioral health problem—mental health 
problem. 
But 
coming 
through 
the 
coronavirus, again, one half of all 
adults say that their mental health has 
been impacted by that, whether that 
was social distancing or everybody try-
ing to do everything that you normally 
do at other places than home. Maybe it 
was 
economic 
uncertainty, 
which, 
along with the isolation, can certainly 
create depression and anxiety. 
It is, in almost all cases, likely to be 
worse for people who had a prior men-
tal health problem or a prior mental 
health diagnosis, but those aren’t the 
only people who have been affected. 
Addiction issues have become a big-
ger problem, again, than they were 6 
months ago. People who don’t have ac-
cess to their support system, people 
who were moving with great focus on 
the part of the Federal Government 
and many State governments away 
from opioid addiction are in a situation 
where they are isolated; they are de-
pressed; they are concerned about job 
or family or health and beginning to 
think: What was that one thing that 
really made me feel good? Well, maybe 
I can just do that one more time and 
have that great feeling, and I wouldn’t 
get addicted again. 
It turns out that addiction doesn’t 
work that way. So we see people with 
unprecedented challenges as this al-
most perfect storm impacting mental 
health hits us. 
Last month, the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration reported nearly a 900-percent— 
a 900-percent—increase in the number 
of calls to its Disaster Distress Hotline 
over this time last year. Nine times as 
many people are calling that distress 
helpline, that Disaster Distress Hot-
line, than were calling a year ago. 
Practitioners in behavioral health 
issues see the impact every day. They 
are certainly warning that this could 
produce its own second wave of impact 
that lasts well beyond the time we 
have treatment for coronavirus be-
cause people, even if they have had the 
vaccine, even if they have stopped wor-
rying about the coronavirus, have 
found themselves in a place with their 
mental health issues that they don’t 
want to be but might not be able to fig-
ure out how to get out of. 
If we don’t respond quickly and we 
don’t respond forcefully, we could cer-
tainly lose more lives to this pan-
demic. One new study from the Well 
Being Trust estimates that 75,000 more 
people will die from things like suicide 
and substance abuse because of the 
pandemic. We are already seeing evi-
dence that that may be a place where 
we are moving. 
My hometown newspaper, the Spring-
field News-Leader, reported this week 
that Greene County, my home county, 
the first place I was elected as a county 
official, has already seen a 25-percent 
uptick in suicide and overdose deaths 
in the last couple of months. 
May is Mental Health Awareness 
Month. I think it is appropriate for us 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
ways 
that 
coronavirus has widened the gap in the 
medical system between access to 
physical health issues and access to 
mental health issues. 
This is the month and the time we 
need to realize that you can’t separate 
those issues. We need to realize that 
those issues are of equal concern and 
need to be treated equally. 
As I mentioned before, the estimate 
generally is somewhere in the neigh-
borhood that one in four Americans 
has a diagnosable mental health issue, 
but the other estimate is that less than 
half of them seek any help or the care 
they need. 
As that number has grown now to 
one in two saying that they have con-
cerns about their mental health or that 
their mental health is not where it was 
before this all started, we see a coming 
together of factors here that we have 
to figure out how to deal with. We need 
to take steps on how to address it. We 
need to realize that more needs to be 
done. We need to continue to work to-
ward the normalization of treating all 
health the same. 
In the CARES Act, the Congress did 
provide $425 million for substance 
abuse and mental health services. That 
includes more than half of that—$250 
million—to certified community be-
havioral health clinics; $50 million for 
suicide prevention; and $100 million for 
emergency response grants to address 
substance and mental health disorders. 
Federal resources are critical, but 
most of the response and most of the 
important work will be done at the 
local level, so the Congress also unani-
mously agreed, in the CARES Act, to 
extend the excellence in mental health 
and addictive treatment demonstration 
program through November 30. 
We added two States. I talked to 
CMS this morning about moving for-
ward in adding those next 2 States to 
the 19 States that originally applied. 
This program was first authorized in 
2014 in some legislation that Senator 
STABENOW from Michigan and I had 
sponsored at the time that created the 
whole concept of certified community 
behavioral health clinics that care for 
patients regardless of where they live 
or their ability to pay—24-hour, 7-day- 
a-week access. It was necessary, if you 
were going to be part of that program, 
that 
you 
could 
get 
preventative 
screenings, you would have care coordi-
nation with your other healthcare pro-
viders. 
By the way, if you have a behavioral 
health issue, it clearly has impact on 
what other health issues you might 
have. If you are dealing with that be-
havioral health issue in the right way, 
you are going to save a lot of money 
and a lot of caregiver time in most 
cases as you deal with your other 
issues if you are doing what you should 
be doing. If you are feeling better 
about yourself, if you are taking your 
medicine, eating better, sleeping bet-
ter, showing up for appointments, your 
other health costs are going to go 
down. So not only is this the right 
thing to do, but it also, in my view, 
will turn out to be a money-saving 
thing to do, to invest money where it 
needs to be invested. 
In eight States that have the cer-
tified centers under the Excellence in 
Mental Health Act, those patients have 
reported a 62-percent reduction in both 
hospitalization and emergency room 
visits. Probably that one statistic, on 
its own, may have offset whatever in-
vestment we have made in this mental 
health program. People not going to 
emergency rooms, obviously, means 
you are less likely to come in contact 
with people who have COVID–19 or 
some other virus. 
We need to be sure we are using tele-
health to connect you with your 
healthcare provider, whether that is a 
mental health provider or another pro-
vider. That is critically important. 
People who are struggling with men-
tal health or addiction are particularly 
challenged right now. We need to let 
them know they are not forgotten, and 
no matter how alone they feel, they are 
not alone, and the Congress is paying 
attention to this, but we need to pay 
attention 
to 
the 
people 
on 
the 
frontlines who are assuring that the 
right things are done in the right way 
at the right time. 
I yield the floor.

May 21, 2020 
NOMINATION OF MAJOR GENERAL SCOTT 
SPELLMON 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, first of 
all, I just want to associate myself 
with the words of my colleague Sen-
ator BLUNT. I couldn’t say it as elo-
quently. I certainly couldn’t improve 
upon it. I am just going to say I com-
pletely agree. Thank you. 
The real purpose for my coming to 
the floor today is to demonstrate my 
support for MG Scott Spellmon of the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
General Spellmon is up for a pro-
motion to Lieutenant General and has 
been nominated to become the Chief of 
Engineers and Commanding General to 
replace General Semonite as he retires. 
Since coming to the Senate, General 
Semonite and I have become well ac-
quainted with each other. While we 
haven’t always agreed, I do appreciate 
his service, his very hard work, and his 
accessibility, especially during this 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
His retirement is well earned, and I 
thank him for his service and wish him 
well. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee and the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, I serve on 
two of the Army Corps committees of 
jurisdiction. As many of my colleagues 
can attest, it is a rare occasion that I 
compliment the Corps. It is an agency 
that is the epitome in many cases of 
cumbersome bureaucracy. 
I am not unique in my frustration. 
During our last EPW hearing with the 
Corps, criticism was both bipartisan 
and tangible. From Rhode Island to 
North Dakota to Oregon, each of us ex-
pressed frustration with a seemingly 
tone-deaf bureaucracy, which either 
doesn’t do what it is supposed to do or 
does what it is not supposed to do. 
That frustration brings me here 
today: Major General Spellmon’s pend-
ing 
nomination 
and 
promotion. 
Throughout this process, I have worked 
closely with General Spellmon on nu-
merous issues important to North Da-
kota and other Western States. 
Early on, I spoke with him regarding 
the Spring Creek embankment in Cen-
tral North Dakota. Due to the poor 
maintenance of relief wells, the Corps 
was going to move forward with a 
water control plan that could poten-
tially devastate water supply and irri-
gation needs in eastern parts of my 
State. 
As per usual, the Corps’ decision ma-
trix was overly complicated and did 
not adequately reflect the needs and 
realities of rural America. When I 
brought the issue to General Spellmon, 
he promised to take a fresh look and 
reassess the economic impacts of the 
project. He then worked with me to 
craft legislation supporting these ef-
forts, which was added to the water in-
frastructure 
legislation 
we 
unani-
mously passed out of the EPW not too 
long ago. He listened to the problem 
and is working with me to help solve 
it. 
I also challenged General Spellmon 
on Western State water rights—a prob-
lem that has plagued Western States 
that operate under the prior appropria-
tion doctrine. On a bipartisan basis, 
Democrats and Republicans from West-
ern States have been frustrated by an 
Army Corps that either ignores States 
and Tribes or needlessly inserts extra 
bureaucracy into decisions that are 
really not theirs to make. Once again, 
General Spellmon listened intently to 
the concern and provided thorough, 
honest responses to be used as a guide-
post for Corps policy moving forward. 
Of equal importance, he acknowl-
edged the flaws within his own organi-
zation. In my time in Congress, hon-
esty sometimes seems to be missing 
but not with General Spellmon. He has 
proven he is willing to listen and be re-
sponsive in a forthright manner, and I 
thank him for that. 
I am confident General Spellmon will 
continue to listen to Western States 
and provide the necessary deference to 
them pursuant to congressional intent 
and to our Nation’s Constitution. I 
have appreciated getting to know the 
general, and while my oversight and 
questions may not have always been 
the most enjoyable to him, he has 
proven to be up to the task of replacing 
General Semonite. I support his nomi-
nation and promotion, and I hope his 
exemplary service will be replicated by 
the rest of the bureaucracy he is going 
to lead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
OBSERVING MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on Mon-
day, our country will celebrate Memo-
rial Day. It is a very special day—one 
that we, as Americans, set aside each 
year to honor those members of the 
military who have given their lives in 
sacrifice to their country. 
Right now, this is typically the time 
when I am getting ready to travel 
home and go to Southern Oregon—to 
Eagle Point and to Central Point, won-
derful communities to spend Memorial 
Day with hundreds of veterans and 
members of their families. These are 
events that take place each year and 
are inspiring and affirming and basi-
cally a time when Oregonians, from 
very young to often approaching al-
most 100 years old, assemble and are 
part of a centuries-long lineage of pa-
triots who have been willing to serve 
and sacrifice for our great Nation. 
There are other communities that 
come 
together 
to 
remember 
lost 
friends and loved ones, but at home in 
Oregon, we have always said: Eagle 
Point and Central Point are the gold 
standard in terms of services and pro-
grams to recognize our veterans, and 
members of their family, who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice for our Na-
tion. 
I think we all know that this Memo-
rial Day is going to be different. There 
will not be the same big gatherings, 
and there will not be as many parades. 
But one of the reasons I want to come 
to the floor of the Senate today—and I 
will be home this weekend thinking 
about Eagle Point and Central Point— 
is I want to make sure our country 
never ever diminishes the significance 
of this day. 
Never should our country take away 
our determination to honor those who 
pay the ultimate price in service to 
America, and it shouldn’t cause us to 
forget that Memorial Day can be 
hard—very, very hard on the parents 
and spouses and children and friends 
our fallen heroes left behind. I know 
when I am recognized to speak in Cen-
tral Point and in Eagle Point, I look 
out in the crowd, and I always see fam-
ily members with a Kleenex by their 
eye, trying to remember and at the 
same time deal with the inevitable 
grief. This Memorial Day, I am going 
to be thinking of all of those who have 
come year after year to Central Point 
and Eagle Point in Southern Oregon to 
do something very, very important: to 
speak up for Oregon on the importance 
and appreciation we have for those who 
made the ultimate sacrifice. 
My view is, this year, on Memorial 
Day, it is more important than ever to 
reach out and connect with those folks 
who are remembering loved ones they 
have lost in the line of duty—to give 
them a call, ask how they are holding 
up—because the last few months, in 
particular, have been tough on every-
body, and their sacrifice shouldn’t be 
forgotten. 
I know when I am home in Southeast 
Portland this weekend, I am going to 
be thinking about whom I am going to 
be talking to, checking in with, and see 
how they are doing just for the reason 
I mentioned. These have been tough 
times for everyone, and I think this is 
going to be a very difficult Memorial 
Day for those Americans who are re-
membering loved ones they have lost in 
the line of duty. 
It is also more important than ever 
to remember for ourselves that as 
Americans, we owe so much to so 
many. The parades and the services 
may have to wait until Memorial Day 
2021, but our deep respect and gratitude 
for sacrifice does not. 
Just on a very personal note, apropos 
of the respect and gratitude for sac-
rifice, I think about my late father and 
my mother, both of whom fled the 
Nazis. Not all of our family got out. My 
great Uncle Max was one of the last 
who was gassed in Auschwitz. My fa-
ther basically talked his way into our 
Army because he was a fluent young 
man in German, and he convinced our 
military that he could be part of our 
propaganda unit to drop the pamphlets 
on the Nazis, making it clear that they 
could never defeat our great troops. 
My mother, on the other hand, was a 
WAC, and I look often at the picture 
that is on my wall of my mother in her 
WAC uniform. For them, during their 
lives, Memorial Day was a really spe-
cial day because they were so thrilled 
to be able to come to the freest and 
most open Nation on Earth and to be 
able to serve in our military. They, in

particular, would say, if they were here 
today: Ron, this is a special day for 
showing our deep respect and gratitude 
for those who made the ultimate sac-
rifice, and we are never going to miss a 
Memorial Day without expressing that 
sentiment. 
I am going to be, this weekend, 
thinking about how much I want to be 
back in Eagle Point and Central Point 
to celebrate Memorial Day, and I am 
going to be thinking about how now we 
have to find a way to honor and re-
member our fallen servicemembers a 
little bit differently than before. 
I would close—and perhaps I am the 
last speaker today in the Senate. I 
think I can speak for every Member of 
the Senate that this is especially im-
portant now to keep in our hearts all of 
those who have died serving our coun-
try, and let’s do right by their families 
who are still with us. 
I close my remarks by wishing all Or-
egonians and Americans from sea to 
shining sea a healthy Memorial Day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection, 
it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
past couple of months, our country has 
gone into a lockdown but then slowly 
but surely has begun to adjust to the 
new normal brought on by COVID–19. 
Many of us have been working safely 
from home, as kitchen tables have been 
transformed 
into 
makeshift 
office 
spaces and, in many cases, classrooms 
as parents and students navigate the 
challenges of remote working and 
learning. But many of the most critical 
jobs in our country can’t be done with 
a laptop and an internet connection— 
defense contractors, for example, the 
intelligence community, law enforce-
ment agencies, and, of course, our he-
roic healthcare workers. They have to 
be on the frontlines doing their job 
each and every day no matter what the 
risk is because their work is considered 
to be essential. 
Our healthcare workers continue to 
fight this virus on the frontlines, deliv-
ering lifesaving care and comfort to 
those isolated from their loved ones. 
Our farmers and ranchers are pro-
ducing the food, truckers are trans-
porting it, and grocery store employees 
are stocking shelves so that amidst all 
of this uncertainty, we don’t have to 
worry about not having enough to eat. 
Then there are the postal workers, the 
delivery drivers, the waste collectors, 
and an entire network of people we de-
pend on who are keeping the cogs of 
our society running. 
Whether working from home or head-
ing out the door each morning, these 
men and women are doing their jobs, 
even when it isn’t easy or convenient, 
and they expect their elected officials 
to do the same thing. 
Just because a pandemic has brought 
our society to a screeching halt doesn’t 
mean the U.S. Congress should pack up 
shop. Just as the men and women 
across the country continue to show up 
for work each day, Congress should do 
the same. After all, our responsibilities 
during this crisis have become more 
important, not less. That is why we 
moved quickly to pass four coronavirus 
response bills, totaling nearly $3 tril-
lion—something none of us imagined 
we would do just a couple of months 
ago—and provided vital support for our 
country amidst so much uncertainty. 
This, of course, came in the form of 
additional resources, including equip-
ment for our healthcare workers and 
funding for ongoing research into vac-
cines and treatments. We also sent aid 
for what I consider to be a lifeline to 
those workers who, through no fault of 
their own, had no job and no paycheck, 
and then we have also provided serious 
resources to help small businesses and 
their workforce stay afloat. 
A financial investment in our fight 
against this virus was desperately 
needed, and that is precisely what we 
delivered on a bipartisan basis, but our 
response to this crisis cannot begin and 
end with blank checks. We need to en-
sure that taxpayer dollars are being 
spent responsibly and that we are mak-
ing the changes needed to recover from 
this crisis. 
Every day I hear—usually through a 
videoconference—my constituents in 
Texas telling me how these bills are 
being implemented, what is helpful, 
what isn’t, and what is needed from 
Congress. This feedback has been in-
credibly valuable as we look for more 
effective ways to strengthen our re-
sponse and speed our recovery. So the 
Republicans in the Senate believe it is 
wise—it is prudent—to take stock of 
everything we have done before passing 
another relief bill. 
I believe the Presiding Officer and I 
heard the same report at lunch today; 
that only about half of the money that 
we have appropriated is actually out 
the door, and yet here people are clam-
oring for more and more money. And 
Speaker PELOSI, in really an unfortu-
nate act of showmanship, rammed 
through a $3 trillion bill that has no 
prayer of being passed or becoming 
law. It is safe to say that House Demo-
crats are taking a different approach 
than we are here in the Senate. 
They passed the $3 trillion bill, and 
they call it the HEROES Act, express-
ing their support for our Nation’s 
healthcare heroes. We would join them 
in that sentiment, but the fact is, their 
priorities are much different. This bill 
mentions cannabis more times than it 
mentions doctors, hospitals, and nurses 
combined. It is an interesting tribute, 
if you ask me. 
If this bill were to become law, tax-
payers’ money wouldn’t be going to 
coronavirus response; they would be 
funding a range of completely unre-
lated pet projects like environmental 
justice grants, soil health studies, and 
not one, but two studies on diversity 
and inclusion—again, in the cannabis 
industry. It is interesting: two more 
studies on diversity and inclusion in 
the cannabis industry. The list of ab-
surdities in this legislation is as big as 
this bill itself. 
Here is another one. They want to 
make sure that the wealthiest Ameri-
cans pay less in taxes. This is from our 
Democratic friends who say that the 
top 1 percent don’t pay enough, yet 
they present them with a huge tax cut 
for the wealthiest people in America. 
It also would complicate the hiring 
that our struggling businesses are al-
ready facing and rapidly dig our Nation 
deeper and deeper into debt. Is this all 
to attack the coronavirus, to come up 
with a treatment or a vaccine? No. 
This is a liberal wish list that has con-
sumed all the time and energy of House 
Democrats over the last several weeks. 
This is what they think is more impor-
tant. 
Rather than returning to Washington 
for more than a drive-by, which is what 
they did last Friday, to work on bipar-
tisan legislation that might actually 
have a chance of becoming law, they 
chose to put together this partisan bill 
without consulting with the White 
House or the Senate. It doesn’t address 
the crisis at hand, let alone the na-
tional security challenges that cannot 
be ignored. 
The threats we faced before this virus 
ever reached our shores, both on land 
and in cyber space, have not gone 
away. From Beijing to Tehran, Moscow 
to Pyongyang, and in nearly every cor-
ner of the globe, our enemies and ad-
versaries are watching and continuing 
their efforts to work against our inter-
ests. They are not going to politely 
pause their efforts so that we can focus 
our efforts on COVID–19; if anything, 
they are doubling their efforts. We can-
not afford to be caught flat-footed. 
Unfortunately, 
our 
counterintel-
ligence and counterterrorism experts 
are already without some of the key 
tools they need in order to carry out 
their duties. In mid-March, the House 
refused to vote on a clean, short-term 
extension of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act under section 215 that 
would preserve these tools while we 
discuss long-term changes that might 
need to be made. Had they agreed at 
that time in mid-March, these authori-
ties would still be intact through the 
end of this month. Instead, House 
Democrats chose to let those authori-
ties lapse. For 2 months now, our coun-
terintelligence and counterterrorism 
experts have been forced to work with-
out some of the most powerful tools in 
their toolboxes. 
Fortunately, last week, the Senate 
was able to pass a bill to reauthorize 
these critical provisions that expired in 
mid-March. This legislation would not 
only restore those authorities but

strengthen oversight of our Nation’s 
intelligence activities at a time when 
it is desperately needed. 
This bill passed the Senate with 
broad bipartisan support, but we are 
still waiting for the House to show up 
for work and to take it up and pass it. 
They are not coming back until the 
27th, I think, of this month, after what 
can only aptly be described as a drive- 
by vote last Friday after not having 
been in town for 2 weeks and leaving 
promptly thereafter. 
Now that they have completed their 
work on their $3 trillion wish list, I 
hope we will see some action soon on 
things that will keep our country safe. 
That is only part of the critical na-
tional security work we have done here 
in the Senate since we returned to 
Washington earlier this month. 
I applaud Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL for bringing us back. People are 
hearing all sorts of scary things on so-
cial media and cable news and even 
conscious disinformation campaigns by 
some of our adversaries about this 
virus and about how we ought to con-
duct ourselves. The best thing we can 
do as Members of the Senate is to dem-
onstrate that with a little bit of per-
sonal responsibility and respect for 
others—maintaining social distancing, 
masking when you can—we can actu-
ally still function. We can show up for 
work like those healthcare workers, 
those law enforcement officers, and 
others I mentioned a moment ago. 
One of the things our majority leader 
likes to say is that the Senate is in the 
personnel business. Today, we con-
firmed a fellow member of the Texas 
congressional delegation, Congressman 
JOHN RATCLIFFE, to be the Director of 
National Intelligence. I have known 
JOHN
for about 10 years—or more 
maybe. He is prepared to continue the 
legacy of outstanding leadership we 
have come to expect and count on in 
our Director of National Intelligence. I 
am confident in his ability to serve as 
a leader and advocate for the intel-
ligence 
professionals 
in 
the 
intel-
ligence community. 
We also confirmed other important 
nominees for critical positions, includ-
ing the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion, the National Counterintelligence 
and Security Center, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. Just as 
the work of the country has waged on 
in the face of these challenges, so must 
our work. 
The American people are not just 
counting on healthcare workers and 
first 
responders 
and 
farmers 
and 
deliverymen and grocery store employ-
ees to do their jobs—as important as 
they are. They are counting on us, too, 
not only to continue to respond to this 
pandemic—to stay nimble and adapt, 
to watch and listen and learn on how 
we can do better—but also to strength-
en our national security, keep an eye 
on our national debt, and do it all on a 
bipartisan basis. 
Like workers across America, Con-
gress needs to show up, especially when 
it isn’t easy or convenient. This pan-
demic may have temporarily halted 
the daily functions of many people in 
this country, but it cannot stop the 
critical work of the U.S. Congress on 
behalf of the people we are privileged 
to represent.

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
few announcements for the information 
of all of our colleagues. 
When we reconvene after meeting 
with our constituents and monitoring 
the pandemic response in our States, 
the Senate will first continue to fill 
critical vacancies in the executive 
branch. 
This week, we confirmed a new Direc-
tor of National Intelligence. In just a 
moment, we will confirm a new Sec-
retary of the Navy. 
But our Democratic colleagues would 
not let the Senate fill several more 
posts over at the Pentagon. So, as has 
sadly become the norm over the last 3 
years, the Senate will be spending floor 
time and multiple rollcall votes on 
each of the following: an Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense and the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. 
If you can believe this, I also had to 
file cloture on the incoming Special In-
spector General for Pandemic Recov-
ery. If we had a nickel for every time 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
claimed that congressional oversight of 
the recovery programs was important, 
the CARES Act would have paid for 
itself. Yet Democrats blocked the con-
firmation of the special inspector gen-
eral to look over the program this 
week. 
The Senate will prepare to confirm 
these qualified people the hard way. 
Three years and counting of Demo-
cratic heel-dragging continues. 
Of course, there will be plenty of leg-
islative business before us as well. Sen-
ators will continue to monitor the pan-
demic response and discuss ways to 
help the Nation pivot toward reopening 
and economic recovery. 
In addition, thanks to the hard work 
of Senators GARDNER and DAINES, we 
will be able to take up their bipartisan 
Great American Outdoors Act in the 
next work period. It is a milestone 
achievement to secure public lands and 
ensure their upkeep well into the fu-
ture. 
We will have the National Defense 
Authorization Act so that we do not let 
this pandemic take our eye off the ball 
of our Nation’s security. 
We will have much work to do in our 
home States next week. We will have 
much to do when we get back here 
after that. All around the Nation, 
Americans are taking precautions, but 
they are continuing to show up to do 
essential jobs and keep the Nation 
going. The Senate is not going to be 
any exception to showing up.

f 
NOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER 
HANSON 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is 
my pleasure to support the confirma-
tion of Christopher Hanson to be a 
Commissioner at the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission. 
Chris has diligently served the Sen-
ate and the people of California over 
the last 6 years as a key member of the 
Senate Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee 
staff. 
During that time, he has advised me 
and the full Senate Appropriations 
Committee on issues surrounding the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in-
cluding its budget, its oversight of nu-
clear reactor decommissioning at San 
Onofre in California, and issues related 
to proposed new reactor technologies. 
He has also overseen nuclear energy 
research and development, radioactive 
waste cleanup, nuclear weapons, non-
proliferation, and naval reactor pro-
grams. 
Prior to coming to the Senate, Chris 
worked at the Department of Energy, 
where he advised the Assistant Sec-
retary of Nuclear Energy and worked 
on appropriations issues for then-Sec-
retary Steven Chu. 
In all, Chris has 25 years of experi-
ence working on the very issues at the 
heart of the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission’s mandate. 
As the Senate knows, the members 
and staff of the Energy and Water Ap-
propriations 
Subcommittee 
work 
seamlessly together in order to produce 
a bipartisan bill each year. Chris’s ex-
pertise, his professionalism, and his 
quiet, good nature are instrumental in 
that effort. He is respected and appre-
ciated by Members on both sides of the 
aisle. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that 
Senator ALEXANDER, our subcommittee 
chairman, sent a letter to the Environ-
mental and Public Works Committee 
in support of Chris’ nomination, which 
I very much appreciate. Senator ALEX-
ANDER and I have spoken about how 
much the subcommittee will miss 
Chris, but we are happy for him, and we 
look forward to working with Chris in 
his new role. 
I have every confidence that Chris 
will give his usual thoughtfulness and 
insight to the issues that come before 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
And I know the other Commissioners 
will find him to be a joy to work with. 
I thank Chris for his dedicated serv-
ice to the people of California, to the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, and 
to the U.S. Senate, and I look forward 
to his success in his new role and con-
tinuing to serve the country with all 
the expertise and professionalism he 
has shown us these past 6 years. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the nomination of David 
Wright to be a member of the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission for 5 more 
years. Amidst a global pandemic that 
has caused the greatest public health 
crisis in a century and the worst eco-
nomic catastrophe since the Great De-
pression, we are spending our time in 
the United States voting on a nominee 
for the NRC who will likely take ac-
tions that put the lives and livelihoods 
of Nevadans at even further risk. 
David Wright has a long history of 
working to advance the failed and fis-
cally irresponsible proposal to dump 
our Nation’s nuclear waste at the 
Yucca Mountain site. In his previous 
work as chairman of the Public Service 
Commission of South Carolina, he sup-
ported continuing licensing of Yucca 
Mountain. Additionally, in 2005 he 
founded the Yucca Mountain Task 
Force and criticized local opposition to 
the project, calling it ‘‘myopic resist-
ance.’’ That is how he characterizes the 
people of Nevada fighting back against 
the injustice of having no say in 
whether or not we are to become the 
Nation’s nuclear dumping ground. 
For these reasons, in August 2018, the 
State of Nevada filed a formal petition 
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit chal-
lenging now-Commissioner Wright’s re-
fusal to disqualify himself from par-
ticipating in NRC Yucca Mountain li-
censing decisions. According to the 
State of Nevada at the time, Wright’s 
participation in any licensing decisions 
would violate Nevada’s constitutional 
right to unbiased decision makers at 
the NRC. 
Numerous studies have since shown 
that Yucca Mountain, only 90 miles 
from Las Vegas, is a physically unsuit-
able site that would threaten the 
health and safety of Nevadans and 
would take half a century to complete. 
Notably, Yucca Mountain is located 
above an aquifer in an area of moderate 
to high seismic activity and is subject 
to oxidizing and corrosive elements. In 
fact, just this week, only days before 
we have been asked to vote on this pro- 
Yucca nominee, two earthquakes—one 
of which was of 6.5 magnitude—struck 
Nevada less than 150 miles from Yucca 
Mountain and less than a dozen miles 
from one of the proposed transpor-
tation routes for shipping nuclear 
waste to Yucca. In addition to threat-
ening the health and safety of Nevad-
ans, transporting all of our Nation’s 
nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain 
would threaten our national security, 
as the site is directly adjacent to the 
Nevada 
Test 
and 
Training 
Range, 
NTTR, the largest air and ground mili-
tary training space in the contiguous 
United States. Establishing a nuclear 
waste repository in such close prox-
imity to NTTR could therefore directly 
jeopardize the readiness of our Air 
Force. 
Most importantly, Nevadans have 
never 
consented 
to 
storing 
other 
States’ waste at Yucca Mountain. With 
thousands 
of 
Nevadans 
dying 
of 
COVID–19 and jobless claims in the 
State at unprecedented levels, today, 
among the numerous actions this Sen-
ate could have chosen to take, we are 
voting on the confirmation of an indi-
vidual who wants to add insult to in-
jury by proceeding with an ill-advised 
plan for nuclear waste storage that ig-
nores the voices of Nevadans. 
I will not stand for this. I, therefore, 
cast my vote against the nomination of 
David Wright to serve on the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate; that if con-
firmed, the motions to reconsider be 
considered made laid upon the table, 
and the President be immediately noti-
fied of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Hanson and 
Wright nominations en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2582 
May 21, 2020 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF JOHN L. 
RATCLIFFE 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in opposition to the con-
firmation 
of 
Congressman 
JOHN 
RATCLIFFE to be Director of National 
Intelligence. 
I voted against JOHN RATCLIFFE for 
Director of National Intelligence for 
three key reasons. 
First, I do not believe Congressman 
RATCLIFFE is qualified for the position 
of Director of National Intelligence, 
DNI. 
By law, a DNI requires ‘‘extensive na-
tional security expertise.’’ Past DNIs 
have been career civil servants or mili-
tary officers with extensive experience 
in intelligence and foreign affairs. 
By contrast, Congressman RATCLIFFE 
has been a member of Congress for 4 
years and the mayor of a small town in 
Texas. His sole intelligence community 
experience is a single year on the 
House Intelligence Committee. 
I am deeply concerned that during 
his hearings he was unable to dem-
onstrate a sufficient understanding of 
the most pressing threats and chal-
lenges that we face as a nation. 
Second, I am very concerned with 
Congressman RATCLIFFE’s position on 
torture. 
During his nomination hearing, he 
refused to denounce torture. He refused 
to admit that certain CIA actions fol-
lowing 9/11 were torture. And he re-
fused to agree that waterboarding is 
torture, regardless of potential changes 
to U.S. law. 
Torture is morally reprehensible, and 
the head of our intelligence commu-
nity must be willing to say so and pre-
vent it from happening again. 
Third, the DNI must not be politi-
cally motivated. The DNI directs 17 in-
telligence agencies with a budget of 
more than $60 billion and is responsible 
for providing objective intelligence 
analysis to the President. 
Congressman RATCLIFFE is a vocal 
defender 
of 
President 
Trump 
and 
served on his impeachment defense 
team. I am concerned that politics 
would interfere in his duties if he were 
confirmed. 
We need a confirmed DNI with the 
right experience and objectivity to do 
the job. 
Congressman RATCLIFFE
was nomi-
nated for this position last year and 
subsequently withdrew. Nothing has 
changed since then to qualify him for 
this role. 
NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that earlier this week the Sen-
ate passed S. Res. 586, a bipartisan res-
olution designating this week National 
Public Works Week. National Public 
Works Week celebrates the profound 
impact our public works professionals 
have on our safety and quality of life. 
Public works are the shared assets that 
make up the backbone of our Nation. 
Public 
service 
professionals 
build, 
manage and operate our nation’s most 
essential services. 
Many of us take for granted work 
that goes into the services we rely on 
every day. This week provides an op-
portunity to reflect on the men and 
women behind those services. Let us 
consider the way our daily life is pow-
ered by public service professionals: We 
wake up in the morning to turn the tap 
on and expect water to come out. We 
place our trash bins on the street and 
expect it is collected in timely manner. 
Some of us may drive over bridges 
built to last generations and follow 
traffic signals that were carefully 
planned to keep us safe. 
The work of public service profes-
sionals has a tangible impact on our 
lives every single day. Consider the 
employee who replaced the aging pipe 
that brings water to your home or the 
scientist that ensured that water is 
safe to drink. Consider also the sanita-
tion worker who keeps your street 
clean and healthy. We can also think of 
the engineer who designed the bridge 
and the construction worker who start-
ed the workday before dawn to ensure 
the construction minimally impacted 
your routine. National Public Works 
Week gives us a formal opportunity to 
humanize these services and say thank 
you to the people working behind the 
scenes to keep our communities run-
ning. 
There is no more important time 
than now to recognize these individ-
uals. The COVID–19 pandemic has chal-
lenged our communities in ways pre-
viously unimaginable. However, we can 
count on public works employees to 
rise to the occasion. Public works em-
ployees are often on the frontlines, 
risking their own health to ensure that 
services are delivered. While much of 
public life has come to a standstill, the 
rhythm of public services continues. 
Water mains break and require repair 
and garbage must still be collected. 
The pandemic has thrust millions of 
Americans into financial uncertainty, 
unsure how they will pay for basic 
services. Many public works agencies, 
like the Baltimore Department of Pub-
lic Works are continuing to offer dis-
counted water rates as the pandemic 
continues. 
Public works also offer hope for our 
Nation’s economic recovery. From the 
Great Depression came a formative era 
in the history of public works in Amer-
ica. President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
understood 
the 
power 
of 
trans-
formative projects to jumpstart Amer-
ica’s economy and provide a higher 
quality life than previously known. 
The New Deal made an indelible im-
pact on the structure of our govern-
ment and trajectory of America’s fi-
nancial recovery. The projects them-
selves now stand as a physical rep-
resentation of our young Nation’s ca-
pacity to overcome adversity with in-
genuity and grit. 
The economic impact of the COVID– 
19 pandemic on our Nation is profound. 
However, our Nation is ripe for invest-
ment in public works projects that will 
put people back to work and stimulate 
our economy, as was done with the New 
Deal. As the ranking member of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Sub-
committee of the Senate Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, I un-
derstand the urgent need to address 
our Nation’s aging infrastructure. That 
is why I am proud that the Committee 
reported favorably, on a bipartisan 
basis, a surface transportation reau-
thorization bill last year, America’s 
Transportation Infrastructure Act, S. 
2303, which authorizes billions of dol-
lars to State and local governments to 
invest in roads, bridges, and highways, 
and why I hope my colleagues in the 
Senate will come together and follow 
through with important infrastructure 
legislation. There is no better time 
than now to invest in our Nation’s in-
frastructure and employ a new class of 
public 
works 
professionals. 
Public 
works are central to the American 
story of resiliency and fortitude, even 
in the face of despair. This week, and 
always, we should look to public works 
professionals with gratitude for their 
contributions to our lives. 
f 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
due to the coronavirus pandemic, Me-
morial Day commemorations will be 
different this year. The coronavirus 
may force us to continue Memorial 
Day traditions virtually or privately 
with our families. Nevertheless, it is 
important for us to take time this 
weekend to honor those who bravely 
gave their lives for all of us. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
courageous and patriotic men and 
women have gone into battle and lost 
their lives to protect the freedoms that 
make being a U.S. citizen such a bless-
ing. I am proud that Mississippians 
throughout our history have readily 
committed to serving our Nation. Like-
wise, we are equally committed to hon-
oring the fallen and their families. 
It was Mississippians who helped ini-
tiate the solemn act of commemo-
rating those lost in battle. Columbus, 
Mississippi, proudly claims rights to 
originating 
Decoration 
Day, 
when 
women began decorating the graves of 
the all casualties not long after the 
Civil War. 
This year, despite all precautions we 
must take, there are ways we can re-
member and honor the fallen. For my 
part, I honor the brave Mississippians 
who have dedicated their lives to pro-
tecting our citizens, and I pray for the

ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today, in honor of Asian Pacific Amer-
ican 
Heritage 
Month. 
Every 
year, 
throughout the month of May, the peo-
ple of the United States join together 
to pay tribute to the contributions and 
achievements of generations of Asian 
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pa-
cific Islanders, AAPI, who have en-
riched the history, culture, and tradi-
tions of this country. 
Today, 
there 
are 
approximately 
23,000,000 AAPis in the United States, 
representing more than 45 distinct eth-
nic groups and speaking over 100 lan-
guage dialects. As the fastest growing 
minority population, the AAPI commu-
nity continues to have an increasing 
impact on our national discourse. 
There are now 20 AAPI members of 
Congress, and a record number of 
AAPIs are serving in State and Terri-
torial legislatures across the Nation. 
This year, as we celebrate Asian Pa-
cific American Heritage Month amid a 
pandemic, 
we 
recognize 
the 
over 
2,000,000 
AAPIS 
working 
on 
the 
frontlines as healthcare professionals, 
first responders, transit operators, and 
in supermarkets and other essential 
service industries. Every day, these he-
roic individuals risk their lives to pro-
tect the health and safety of Ameri-
cans during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency. 
We 
also 
reflect 
broadly 
on 
the 
achievements and contributions of the 
AAPI community in the areas of poli-
tics and government, education and the 
arts, music, writing and literature, 
sports, business, medicine, and law. We 
pay tribute to the leaders before us, 
who overcame great adversity and 
paved the way forward. 
We honor great statesmen like Dan-
iel Kahikina Akaka, the first person of 
Native Hawaiian ancestry to serve in 
the U.S. Senate. Throughout his nearly 
four decades in Congress, Senator 
Akaka worked to change the public’s 
perception of the AAPI community and 
helped to preserve and restore Hawai-
ian language, culture, and traditions. 
Although he recently passed away, 
Senator Akaka’s spirit as a true cham-
pion of aloha endures. 
We also remember influential labor 
organizers like Larry ltliong, Peter 
Velasco, and Philip Vera Cruz, who in 
1965, led the Filipino-American farm-
workers to strike alongside Cesar Cha-
vez, demanding better pay, benefits, 
and working conditions. The Delano 
Grape Strike was one of the most piv-
otal civil rights and labor movements 
in American history. It opened doors 
for immigrants and people of color and 
inspired countless others to stand to-
gether and demand their rights. 
Around the time that the Filipino- 
American grape workers began their 
strike in 1965, Congress enacted the Im-
migration and Nationality Act, INA, 
also known as the Hart-Celler Act. 
This landmark legislation overturned 
discriminatory race- and nationality- 
based immigration policies that pre-
viously barred immigration from Asia. 
The INA established new policies based 
on reuniting families and attracting 
skilled professionals and helped refu-
gees fleeing violence or unrest, notably 
those 
escaping 
war-torn 
Southeast 
Asia. By opening the United States to 
immigration from Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America, the INA’s enduring leg-
acy includes diversifying the demo-
graphic makeup of our country. 
This month, I introduced a resolution 
in honor of Asian Pacific American 
Heritage Month. While we commemo-
rate the contributions of the AAPI 
community, this pandemic has tested 
the strength of our nation. Anti-Asian 
racism and attacks are on the rise, 
stoked by those in the highest levels of 
government. This recent surge in dis-
crimination and hate crimes against 
the AAPI community demonstrates 
how much work must still be done to 
achieve full equality. As a country of 
immigrants, we must now, more than 
ever, embrace the rich diversity of our 
communities, and stand up for the civil 
rights and equal treatment of all 
Americans. 
f 
CONFIRMATIONS 
OF 
DAVID 
A. 
WRIGHT AND CHRISTOPHER T. 
HANSON 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today, the Senate confirmed the nomi-
nations of David Wright and Chris-
topher Hanson to serve as Commis-
sioners on the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, NRC. While I am pleased 
that these nominees will provide the 
NRC with a full Commission, I remain 
deeply concerned with Mr. Wright’s 
history of strongly supporting efforts 
to move the Yucca Mountain reposi-
tory forward and oppose his confirma-
tion today. 
Shortly after Mr. Wright joined the 
Commission in 2018, the State of Ne-
vada called for Mr. Wright to recuse 
himself from matters pertaining to 
Yucca Mountain licensing. He refused. 
Mr. Wright is on the record calling for 
the ‘‘expeditious implementation of 
the Yucca Mountain program’’ and 
founded the Yucca Mountain Task 
Force. His refusal to recuse himself de-
nies Nevada its right to an unbiased 
Commissioner on the NRC and furthers 
the distrust that plagues the Nation’s 
management of nuclear waste. 
More than 30 years ago, Nevada was 
thrown into the center of the nuclear 
waste debate, when Congress dismissed 
the siting process it established in the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and 
named Yucca Mountain the sole nu-
clear waste repository for the Nation 
over the strong objections of Nevadans. 
The site is physically unsuitable and 
puts at risk the safety, security, and 
economic well-being of the State. The 
decision broke the trust of the Amer-
ican people in the government’s ability 
to responsibly manage nuclear waste. 
The reappointment of Mr. Wright to 
the NRC does nothing to regain the 
trust of Nevadans or establish con-
fidence in nuclear waste repository li-
censing processes. 
Commissioners serving on the inde-
pendent agency must be neutral and 
unbiased in order to ensure confidence 
in the guidance, regulations, and deter-
minations issued by the NRC. Mr. 
Wright can make the decision to recuse 
himself from Yucca Mountain licensing 
matters, and it is my hope that he will 
chose to do so to bring integrity to the 
Commission and to restore the rights 
of the State of Nevada. 
I also acknowledge the importance of 
Mr. Hanson being confirmed to the 
NRC today. He will help bring balance 
to the Commission with his decades of 
experience on nuclear energy and waste 
issues. 
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues in the Senate to ensure Con-
gress continues to utilize its authority 
to oversee the work of the Commission 
and hope all Commissioners will ap-
proach all matters, including those 
that pertain to Yucca Mountain licens-
ing, without preexisting bias and con-
flicts of interest.

NATIONAL

OF 
AWARENESS 
FOR MISSING AND MURDERED 
NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS

the Senate passes my annual resolu-

Day of Awareness for Missing and Mur-
dered Native Women and Girls, for the 
fifth year in a row. We hope to con-
tinue drawing attention to this crisis 
as we work together to find a solution. 
I would also like to commend the 
work that the Trump administration 
has done to address this crisis. In par-
ticular, they have established the Lady 
Justice Program at the Department of 
the Interior and issued a proclamation 
on November 26, 2019, to sustain public 
attention on this ongoing and impor-
tant situation.∑

TRIBUTE TO WILLIE K 
∑ Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, with the 
passing of Willie K, Hawaii has lost a 
music legend. Through his raw talent 
and unmatched musicianship, Willie K 
blazed a trail that redefined music in 
Hawaii and across the country. 
Born William Kahaialı´i—and known 
affectionately 
as 
‘‘Uncle 
Willie’’ 
throughout 
our 
State—Willie 
K 
wouldn’t be tied down to any single 
genre or instrument. Instead, he did it 
all. Willie could play or sing almost 
anything. 
Willie’s love for music came from his 
family. Raised in a family of musicians 
in Lahaina, Willie started performing 
at just 8 years old. Taught by his fa-
ther and renowned guitarist, Manu

May 21, 2020 
Kahaiali‘i, Willie mastered the blues at 
a young age. He became a virtuoso in-
strumentalist—learning how to play 
every instrument that might be needed 
in a show from a guitar to a bass to a 
ukulele. And his voice was one of a 
kind. No style was off limits, even 
opera. He was able to effortlessly 
bridge blues and Hawaiian, local and 
mainstream, music and culture. 
Over the course of his career, Willie 
recorded numerous albums and per-
formed with icons like Prince, Steven 
Tyler, Willie Nelson, and Santana. Al-
ways humble, he described himself as 
‘‘a working musician’’—despite earning 
19 Na Hoku Hanohano awards, a Hawaii 
Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime 
Achievement Award, and a Grammy 
nomination. 
Willie devoted his life to music and 
understood its power. He went to great 
lengths to help other local artists in 
Hawaii succeed and organized his BBQ 
Bluesfest 
annually. 
Even 
after 
he 
began to feel the effects of his illness, 
he continued to share his music. 
Willie showed us all so many things. 
He was talented, energetic, passionate, 
and authentic. But what really sepa-
rated him from the rest was his unre-
lenting zest for life and aloha spirit. 
My thoughts and deepest sympathies 
are with his ohana and all those who 
loved him. He will be well remembered 
and greatly missed. 
May his memory be a blessing. May 
his music live on.∑

TRIBUTE TO PETER M. HAYES 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the esteemed career and 
public service of Mr. Peter M. Hayes, 
who is retiring as associate general 
manager and chief public affairs execu-
tive of the Salt River Project, or SRP. 
The Salt River Project is the Na-
tion’s third largest public power util-
ity. It manages an extensive system of 
dams, reservoirs, wells, canals, and ir-
rigation laterals, providing water and 
electricity to more than 2 million peo-
ple in metropolitan Phoenix. As asso-
ciate general manager and chief public 
affairs executive, Mr. Hayes has not 
only been integral in providing utili-
ties to Arizonans’ homes; he has also 
supported many issues that have ad-
vanced Arizona’s economy, including 
the expansion of public education, the 
development 
of 
transportation sys-
tems, and the construction of infra-
structure necessary to support Arizo-
na’s sports and tourism industries. 
Mr. Hayes has also served as chair-
man of the board of the Sandra Day 
O’Connor Institute, the chairman of 
the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Com-
merce, a board member of the Arizona 
Chamber of Commerce, a trustee of the 
Arizona Science Center, a member of 
the Dean’s Advisory Board of the Ari-
zona State University Barrett Honors 
College, and a member of the Arizona 
Commission on the Arts. He served as 
an aide to the former Minority Leader 
and Arizona Congressman John J. 
Rhodes, as Deputy Director of Congres-
sional Liaison for two Secretaries of 
the Interior, and as chief of staff to 
former Arizona Governor Fife Syming-
ton. In both the public and private sec-
tors, Mr. Hayes has been a leader in 
public policy. He has wielded his exper-
tise and vision to manage a wide array 
of energy and water issues to benefit 
the State of Arizona. 
I thank Mr. Hayes for his years of 
dedicated work and public service on 
behalf of Arizona.∑

TRIBUTE TO JILL LEBLANC 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Jill LeBlanc of Broadwater County for 
her tremendous efforts to support the 
community 
during 
the 
ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Jill is a certified physician assistant 
working 
on 
the 
frontlines 
of 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
at 
the 
Broadwater Health Center. 
During the early stages of the pan-
demic, when the State of Montana was 
responding to its first cases and health 
clinics were still navigating procedures 
on how to handle the COVID–19 out-
break, Jill dropped everything to go 
serve. She moved out of her home to 
keep her children safe and spent count-
less hours at the hospital educating 
herself and the staff at Broadwater 
Health Center with the necessary infor-
mation and up to date procedures on 
how to handle the outbreak. 
Jill spent one-on-one time with each 
nurse on her shift to provide consistent 
updates and guidance on CDC guide-
lines, proper protective equipment pro-
tocols, how to handle isolated patients, 
and methods to conduct testing for 
COVID–19, both inside the Broadwater 
Health Center and through the drive- 
thru triage system. 
When 
Jill 
is 
not 
working 
at 
Broadwater Health Center, she spends 
additional time sharpening her skills 
at Deer Lodge Medical Center and 
Benefis, where volumes of patients are 
higher. 
It is my honor to recognize Jill as a 
health care hero working to protect 
the health and safety of all Montanans 
during these uncertain times. I know 
that the staff and the patients at 
Broadwater Health Center are grateful 
for Jill’s selflessness and leadership 
during this pandemic. I am grateful to 
Jill for the extraordinary work she is 
doing to support her community.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 3811. A bill to provide financial as-
sistance for projects to address certain 
subsidence impacts in the State of 
California, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the Restora-
tion of Essential Conveyance Act, 
which I introduced today. Representa-
tives TJ COX
and JIM
COSTA, both 
Democrats of California, have intro-
duced companion legislation in the 
House. 
This legislation would help Cali-
fornia water users and California’s na-
tion-leading agricultural industry com-
ply with a recent State requirement to 
end the overpumping of groundwater. 
The stakes are huge: Bringing ground-
water into balance will reduce the 
water supply of the San Joaquin Valley 
by about 2 million acre-feet per year. 
Unless local water agencies and the 
State and Federal governments take 
action, a recent U.C. Berkeley study 
has projected severe impacts from 
these water supply losses: 798,000 acres 
of land would have to be retired from 
agricultural production, nearly one- 
sixth of the working farmland in an 
area that produces half the fruit and 
vegetables grown in the Nation; and 
$5.9 billion would be lost in annual 
farm income. 
How the bill would help: One of the 
most cost-effective and efficient ways 
to restore groundwater balance is to 
convey floodwaters to farmlands where 
they can recharge the aquifer. Cali-
fornia has the most variable precipita-
tion of any State. When we get massive 
storms from atmospheric rivers, there 
is 
plenty 
of 
runoff 
to 
recharge 
aquifers—but only if we can effectively 
convey the floodwaters throughout the 
San Joaquin Valley to recharge areas. 
Here is where the challenge arises. 
For a variety of reasons, the ground be-
neath the major canals has dropped by 
as much as 10 to 20 feet which has 
caused canals designed to convey flood-
waters to buckle and drop in many 
places. Other parts of the canals have 
not subsided, so the water gets stuck in 
the low points. 
As a result, these essential canals for 
conveying floodwaters have lost as 
much as 60 percent of their conveyance 
capacity. The bill I am introducing 
today would provide Federal assistance 
to help fix these Federal canals. 
Specifically, the bill would authorize 
$600 million in Federal funding-cost 
share for three major projects to repair 
Federal canals damaged by subsidence 
to achieve their lost capacity: $200 mil-
lion for the Friant-Kern Canal, which 
would move an additional 100,000 acre- 
feet per year on average; $200 million 
for the Delta Mendota Canal, which 
would move an additional 62,000 acre- 
feet per year on average; and $200 mil-
lion for California Aqueduct repairs, 
which would move an additional 205,000 
acre-feet per year on average. While 
parts of the California Aqueduct are 
State-owned, the majority of the re-
pairs are on its federally owned por-
tion. 
The bill would also authorize $200 
million in additional funding for the 
Environmental Restoration Goal of the 
San Joaquin River settlement. This 
provision will ensure that the bill helps 
to restore not only the San Joaquin 
Valley’s water supply, but also its na-
tive salmon runs. I think it is appro-
priate that we consider legislation that 
would benefit both our water supply 
and the environment. 
Benefits of the bill: If the Federal 
Government covers a portion of the 
cost of restoring these three essential 
Federal canals for conveying flood-
waters, it will give local farmers a 
fighting chance to bring their ground-
water basins into balance without 
being forced to retire massive amounts 
of land. 
Critically, the ability to deliver 
floodwaters through restored Federal 
canals will allow the water districts to 
invest in their own turnouts, pumps, 
detention basins and other ground-
water recharge projects. The South 
Valley Water Association, which covers 
just a small part of the Valley, pro-
vided my office with a list of 36 such 
projects for its area alone. 
The Public Policy Institute of Cali-
fornia, or PPIC, has determined that 
groundwater recharge projects are the 
best option to help the San Joaquin 
Valley comply with the new state 
groundwater 
pumping 
law. 
PPIC 
projects that the Valley can make up 
300,000 to 500,000 acre feet of its ground-
water 
deficit 
through 
recharge 
projects. 
Job Losses if We Take No Action: A 
forthcoming study commissioned by 
the coalition group called the ‘‘Water 
Blueprint for the San Joaquin Valley’’ 
estimates that required reductions in 
groundwater could cause a loss of up to 
42,000 farm and agricultural jobs in the 
San Joaquin Valley. Another 40,000 
jobs or more could be lost statewide 
each year due to reductions in valley 
agricultural production, putting the 
total 
at 
approximately 
85,000 
jobs 
statewide. Most of these impacts will 
fall disproportionately on economi-
cally 
disadvantaged 
communities. 
These impacts will be significant un-
less we address them through collabo-
rative planning, policies, infrastruc-
ture, recharge, and necessary financial 
support. 
Friant-Kern Canal: Let me now turn 
to the three critical canals that the 
bill would authorize assistance to re-
store. The Friant-Kern Canal is a key 
feature of the Friant Division of the 
Federal Central Valley Project on the 
Eastside of the San Joaquin Valley. 
For nearly 70 years, the Friant Divi-
sion successfully kept groundwater ta-
bles stable on the Eastside. This pro-
vided a sustainable source of water for 
farms and for thousands of Californians

and more than 50 small, rural, or dis-
advantaged communities who rely en-
tirely on groundwater for their house-
hold water supplies. 
But 
unsustainable 
groundwater 
pumping in the valley has reduced the 
Friant-Kern Canal’s ability to deliver 
water to all who need it. Land ele-
vation subsidence caused by over- 
pumping means that not all of the sup-
plies stored at Friant Dam can be con-
veyed through the canal. In some 
areas, the canal can carry only 40 per-
cent of what it is designed to deliver. 
In 2017, a very wet year in which we 
should have been banking as much 
flood water as possible, the Friant- 
Kern Canal couldn’t deliver an addi-
tional 300,000 acre-feet of water that it 
would have been able to convey had its 
capacity not been limited by subsid-
ence. This significant amount of water 
would have been destined for ground-
water recharge efforts in the south San 
Joaquin Valley, where the impacts of 
reduced water deliveries, water quality 
issues and groundwater regulation are 
expected to be most severe. 
California 
Aqueduct 
and 
Delta 
Mendota Canal: The California Aque-
duct serves more than 27 million people 
in Southern California and the Silicon 
Valley and more than 750,000 acres of 
the Nation’s most productive farmland. 
But despite its name, much of the Cali-
fornia Aqueduct is owned by the Fed-
eral Government and serves portions of 
Silicon Valley, small towns and com-
munities in the northern San Joaquin 
Valley, and farms from Firebaugh to 
Kettleman City. The aqueduct rep-
resents a successful 70–year partner-
ship between the Federal Government 
and the State of California. 
In recent years, particularly recent 
drought years, the California Aqueduct 
has subsided. It has lost as much as 20 
percent of its capacity to move water 
to California’s families, farms, and 
businesses. California is leading efforts 
to repair the aqueduct and is working 
to provide its share of funding, but the 
Federal Government will also need to 
pay its fair share. The bill I am intro-
ducing today would authorize $200 mil-
lion toward restoring the California 
Aqueduct. 
The Delta-Mendota Canal stretches 
southward 117 miles from the C.W. Bill 
Jones Pumping Plant along the west-
ern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, 
parallel to the California Aqueduct. 
The Delta-Mendota Canal has lost 15 
percent of its conveyance capacity due 
to subsidence. The bill I am intro-
ducing today would authorize $200 mil-
lion toward restoring its full ability to 
convey floodwaters to farms needing to 
recharge their groundwater, and to 
wildlife refuges for migratory water-
fowl. 
In conclusion, this bill responds to a 
potential crisis that very possibly 
could cause the forced retirement of 
nearly one-sixth of the working farm-
land in an area that produces half of 
America’s fruits and vegetables. 
These are Federal canals, and the 
Federal Government must help give 
these farmers and communities reliant 
of the agricultural economy a fighting 
chance to keep their lands in produc-
tion. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. I yield the floor. 
By Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. 
CARDIN, Ms. COLLINS, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, and Mr. DURBIN): 
S. 3833. A bill to extend the loan for-
giveness period for the paycheck pro-
tection program, and for other pur-
poses; read the first time. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce, with my colleagues 
Senator RUBIO, CARDIN, and SHAHEEN, 
legislation to strengthen the Paycheck 
Protection Program, which has proven 
to be such an important lifeline to 
America’s small businesses and their 
employees during this pandemic. 
Senators RUBIO, CARDIN, SHAHEEN, 
and I worked together as part of the 
Small Business Task Force to create 
this program during the development 
of the CARES Act 2 months ago. 
Since its launch in early April, this 
program has provided forgivable loans 
totaling more than $510 billion to ap-
proximately 4.3 million small employ-
ers across the country. The over-
whelming majority of borrowers are 
very small employers. 
In phase 1 of the program, the aver-
age PPP loan size nationally was 
$206,000. That translates to an average 
employer size of just 18 employees. As 
more loans have been approved in 
phase 2, the average loan size nation-
ally has dropped to $118,000, suggesting 
an average business size of about 10 
employees. 
In Maine, the average loan size is 
even smaller, with borrowers having an 
estimated 12 employees in phase 1 and 
just three employees in phase 2. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
nearly two-thirds of the small busi-
nesses in Maine have benefited from 
PPP loans, and that is, I am pleased to 
say, among the highest rates in the Na-
tion. 
In many ways, it is not a surprise. 
Maine is the State of small businesses. 
Ninety percent of all the Maine busi-
nesses are considered to be small busi-
nesses, and they employ approximately 
60 percent of all the workers in our 
State. Overall, in Maine, the funds are 
sufficient to support approximately 
200,000 jobs. 
Let’s think about this. That means 
that a business that is seeing receipts 
go down, is in a cash flow problem, li-
quidity has dried up can still retain 
employees who otherwise would have 
been laid off. In more cases, it has al-
lowed a business to call back fur-
loughed employees. And even in cases 
where the business has been forced to 
close its doors because of government 
orders, it has kept alive the connection 
between the employer and his or her 
employees. That is so important be-
cause, as the economy does open back 
up, we want to make sure that link be-
tween the employer and the employees 
remains intact so that the workforce 
can come back to work as soon as pos-
sible. 
It is important, as we discuss the 
economic data behind the PPP, to re-
member that these are real businesses 
with real people—people like Larry 
Geaghan, who owns and runs a craft 
brewery and pub in Bangor, ME. Larry 
calls the PPP a ‘‘lifeline bill’’ that has 
made all the difference in helping him 
to bring back 25 of his employees and 
reopen for takeout business. 
Another Maine borrower—the owner 
of a small marina—told me that the 
PPP was exactly what he needed at ex-
actly the right time. With the PPP, 
this marina has been able to keep all of 
its employees on payroll, and because 
they weren’t worried about whether 
they would have a paycheck, these em-
ployees continued spending as they 
normally 
would—exactly 
what 
our 
Maine economy needs. 
Another example of a small business 
helped by the PPP is the Frog & Turtle 
Gastro Pub in Westbrook, ME. This 
pub just completed an extensive ren-
ovation and is hoping to reopen June 1, 
the first day that sit-down dining serv-
ice will be allowed again in the State 
of Maine. 
The owner of this pub wrote to me to 
say that the ‘‘PPP program allowed us 
to bring back our 15 employees and sus-
tain our business during these trying 
conditions,’’ and that taking a PPP 
loan was the ‘‘right decision’’ for his 
employees and for his small restaurant. 
When we were initially developing 
the Paycheck Protection Program, we 
had no idea how long the pandemic 
would last. We did not know that there 
would be virtually universal economic 
shutdowns, nor did we know how each 
State would respond to outbreaks in 
their communities. The bipartisan bill 
that we are introducing today builds 
on the success of the PPP by providing 
small businesses with additional flexi-
bility so that they can more effectively 
use these funds in conjunction with 
State reopening plans. 
And, again, I would remind my col-
leagues that when we were drafting the 
first version of this, it was before there 
were widespread orders shutting down 
restaurants and bars and retail estab-
lishments. 
Specifically, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program Extension Act that we 
are introducing today would do the fol-
lowing: It would allow borrowers the 
flexibility to use their 8 weeks of fund-
ing at a point of their choosing within 
a 16-week period. Small businesses 
could choose the period that they be-
lieve works best to coincide with the 
reopening of their local economy. 
So some small businesses took the 
loans very early, thinking that the 
shutdowns would not last or that the 
pandemic would be on the way down by 
now, which it is in some States, thank 
goodness, but not in all. 
Well, this builds in more flexibility. 
You would have 16 weeks to use the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2590 
May 21, 2020 
Second, it extends the deadline to 
apply for a PPP loan from June 30 to 
December 31 of this year. 
Again, this reflects the fact that 
shutdowns lasted far longer in vir-
tually every State than we anticipated 
when we were drafting the bill in 
March. 
Third, the bill would allow borrowers 
to use loan funds to purchase personal 
protective equipment for employees 
and to pay for adaptive investments 
needed to reopen safely. 
Adaptive investments could include 
modifications to a commercial prop-
erty 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
social 
distancing regulations or guidelines 
from the CDC. It could mean creating 
or expanding a drive-through window 
service, erected physical barriers such 
as we see at the grocery stores now, 
those plexiglass barriers or sneeze 
guards. It could mean installing ven-
tilation system upgrades or, as many 
restaurants have mentioned to me, 
they would like to add an outside patio 
for outdoor eating, which would allow 
them to maintain the same number of 
customers, which they can’t do now, 
and abide by the social distancing 
guidelines. 
The bill would also clarify that the 
current lender hold-harmless provision 
relates to all Small Business Adminis-
tration and Treasury guidance regard-
ing PPP loans. A lender that in good 
faith followed Federal guidance related 
to PPP would not be later held liable if 
the guidance subsequently changed. 
I would like to give a shout-out to 
our small community banks and credit 
unions in the State of Maine. They 
have really stepped up to the plate for 
this program to serve the small busi-
nesses, small employers in our State, 
for the small nonprofits, and that has 
made a real difference to the employ-
ees of these establishments. 
And finally, the bill would clarify 
that borrowers who have maintained 
payroll for 8 weeks will not lose loan 
forgiveness due to the extension of the 
program to 16 weeks. 
Now, I would hope that that would be 
obvious, but we wanted to make sure 
that we were explicit. 
The Paycheck Protection Program is 
the single most critical stimulus pro-
gram protecting Main Street America 
from the economic devastation of the 
measures taken to control the spread 
of COVID–19. The bill we are intro-
ducing today strengthens the PPP to 
reflect the evolving nature of this pan-
demic, the necessity of regulatory ac-
tions that have caused a great deal of 
economic harm but were necessary to 
prevent the spread of the virus, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
By Mr. CRUZ: 
S. 3835. A bill to prohibit the use of 
funds for the production of films by 
United States companies that alter 
content for screening in the People’s 
Republic of China, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to discuss the single most dangerous 
geopolitical threat that America faces 
now and through the next century— 
China. 
We are in the midst of a pandemic 
that has infected over 5 million people 
and has claimed the lives of over 300,000 
people worldwide. In the United States 
alone, the pandemic has infected over 
1.5 million people and has claimed over 
93,000 lives. 
The coronavirus pandemic has shat-
tered the lives of husbands and wives, 
daughters, 
sons, 
granddaughters, 
grandsons, brothers, sisters, nieces, 
nephews who have lost loved ones to 
COVID–19. 
It has also shattered the lives of 
those who have lost their jobs, their 
livelihoods, because of this disease. 
Thirty-eight million Americans are 
now out of work. The unemployment 
rate is at the highest it has ever been 
since the Great Depression, and entire 
industries are on the brink of collapse. 
Just 4 months ago, when the economy 
was booming, that was unthinkable. 
Where did this pandemic start? In 
China. Whether it began at the Huanan 
wet 
market, 
a 
barbaric 
breeding 
ground for disease, where snakes and 
turtles and puppies and kittens and 
bats and other wildlife and farm ani-
mals are killed and sold, or whether it 
began due to substandard safety proto-
cols at the Wuhan Institute of Virol-
ogy, where research into coronavirus 
was being conducted and specifically 
coronavirus from bats, we don’t yet 
know. 
Here is what we do know: Not only 
did the coronavirus outbreak start in 
China, the Chinese Communist Govern-
ment did everything it could to cover 
up the severity of the outbreak, from 
lying about the origin of the virus to 
how it is transmitted, to destroying 
evidence, to silencing the brave whis-
tleblower doctors and scientists and 
journalists and activists who tried to 
warn the world and prevent a global 
pandemic. 
It has been reported recently that be-
tween January 1 and April 4, the Chi-
nese Government charged 484 people 
with crimes because of comments they 
made about the coronavirus pandemic. 
In Wuhan, eight doctors who sounded 
the alarm about coronavirus in Decem-
ber were accused of spreading lies, ar-
rested, and forced to sign documents 
claiming that they had made false 
statements that ‘‘disturbed the public 
order.’’ 
In reality, they were telling the 
truth. They were warning us. 
One of those doctors, Dr. Ai Fen, has 
been missing since late March. An-
other, Dr. Li Wenliang, has since died 
from 
the 
coronavirus. 
Dr. 
Li 
Wenliang’s wife was pregnant with the 
couple’s second child when he died. 
And it is not just Chinese doctors 
who are paying the price for telling the 
truth; journalists and activists who 
courageously spoke up are disappearing 
too. 
Xu Zhangrun, a Chinese law professor 
who spoke out about the Chinese Gov-
ernment’s handling of the coronavirus 
outbreak and criticized Chinese Presi-
dent Xi, has been missing since Feb-
ruary. 
Chen Qiushi, a Chinese lawyer and 
journalist who went to Wuhan to re-
port on what was happening there, has 
been missing since February 6. Fang 
Bin, a Wuhan businessman and jour-
nalist who reported on the number of 
bodies piling up outside a Wuhan hos-
pital has been missing since February 
9. Li Zehua, a journalist who quit his 
job as a broadcaster for the Chinese 
Communist Party’s TV station so he 
could report on what was happening in 
Wuhan, went missing for 28 days and 
then was allowed to reappear in public 
only after he praised the government’s 
policy. Ren Zhiqiang, a real estate ty-
coon, who had been publicly critical of 
President 
Xi’s 
handling 
of 
the 
coronavirus crisis, has been missing 
since March 12. And Xu Zhiyong, a civil 
rights lawyer and a legal scholar who 
criticized President Xi on social media 
for his handling of the coronavirus cri-
sis, has been on house arrest since Feb-
ruary 13. 
If the Chinese Government had acted 
responsibly and sought the advice of 
public health professionals instead of 
silencing them, there is a very real pos-
sibility the coronavirus could have 
been contained as a regional outbreak. 
Instead, we are now dealing with a 
deadly global pandemic. 
These brave men and women are just 
the latest targets of the Chinese Com-
munist Government’s relentless at-
tacks on truth-tellers, on freedom 
fighters, and on religious and ethnic 
minorities. The Chinese Government is 
a 1984-style dystopian state, and it has 
tracked and imprisoned millions of 
Uyghurs and other religious minori-
ties. The Chinese Government is con-
stantly tracking the movements of 
millions of people using cutting-edge 
biotechnology 
and 
artificial 
intel-
ligence, and it has put 1 million 
Uyghurs, right now, into concentration 
camps. 
In 2017, I led a bipartisan resolution 
in this body condemning the Chinese 
Communist Party’s persecution of reli-
gious minorities, particularly Buddhist 
Tibetans. Last year, I introduced legis-
lation and urged the Trump adminis-
tration to blacklist Chinese companies 
that are aiding the Chinese Govern-
ment in its persecution of the Uyghurs. 
The administration implemented the 
recommendations in my legislation, 
and as a result those companies are 
now banned from acquiring American 
goods. That is a step in the right direc-
tion. 
We have known that China’s surveil-
lance state and censorship practices 
are a great threat to human rights, but 
what the pandemic has shown us is 
that China’s surveillance state and 
censorship is also a great threat to our 
national security and to public health. 
Had those doctors, journalists, and ac-
tivists who were trying to tell the

truth—desperately trying to warn the 
world—had they been allowed to speak, 
the coronavirus outbreak might have 
been stopped in its tracks. We may not 
have had to deal with this devastating 
pandemic that has claimed the lives 
and the livelihoods of men and women 
all over the world. 
That is why, today, I am introducing 
legislation to sanction Chinese officials 
who helped censor political speech or 
suppress the dissemination of medical 
information by citizens of China. This 
legislation would impose visa bans and 
asset blocks on those who punish or 
censor Chinese citizens for reporting 
accurate information about a disease 
or a pathogen and hopefully will help 
prevent something like this from ever 
happening again in China. 
We need to be vigilant and to act 
where we can to thwart the Chinese 
Government’s attempts to twist the 
truth, to censor, and to silence within 
China, but we also need to be vigilant 
about the Chinese Government’s at-
tempts to censor and silence elsewhere, 
including in our own Nation. 
In the United States, the Chinese 
Government attempts to spread propa-
ganda by two ways: by leveraging their 
enormous market access to coerce 
Americans into self-censorship, espe-
cially to Hollywood and sports teams 
that stand to make billions of dollars 
in China, and by simply purchasing ac-
cess to our cultural and educational 
centers. With both levers, Chinese offi-
cials have one objective: to shape what 
Americans see, hear, and ultimately 
think. 
China has the world’s second largest 
film market, second only the United 
States, and it does around $8 billion in 
box office revenues per year. The Chi-
nese film market is comprised of Chi-
nese films, but they also make sure to 
allow a few dozen American films into 
their market every year. The number 
is deliberately kept low, and in ex-
change for access, American film com-
panies submit their films to China’s 
censors who often force them to change 
those films. American companies have 
learned this fact, and they will often 
change the films even in advance of 
submitting. 
As a result, they control not just 
what audiences see in China but also 
what Americans see. The Chinese Gov-
ernment’s censorship office seeks to 
edit anything to do with Tibet, with 
Taiwan, with Tiananmen Square, with 
human rights, with democracy, with 
religion, or with any criticism of com-
munism, particularly the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Recently, the Chinese 
Government has succeeded in forcing 
changes to movies such as ‘‘Top Gun,’’ 
the sequel; such as ‘‘Doctor Strange’’; 
such as ‘‘Skyfall’’; such as the remake 
of ‘‘Red Dawn.’’ ‘‘Pixels,’’ ‘‘Looper,’’ 
‘‘Bohemian Rhapsody’’ all were movies 
that were changed. 
In ‘‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’’ the Chi-
nese Communist Party edited out ref-
erences to the fact that Freddy Mer-
cury was gay. In ‘‘Doctor Strange,’’ 
they changed the Ancient One’s char-
acter from Tibetan, as portrayed in the 
comic book, to Celtic. And in the ‘‘Top 
Gun’’ sequel that is set to come out 
later this year, the Taiwanese and Jap-
anese flag on the back of Maverick’s 
jacket were removed to appease the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
Think about that for a second. What 
message does it send that ‘‘Maverick,’’ 
an American icon, is apparently afraid 
of Chinese Communists. That is ridicu-
lous. 
That is why, today, I am introducing 
the SCRIPT Act, which would cut off 
Hollywood studios from the assistance 
they receive from the U.S. Government 
if those films censor their films for 
screening in China. It is common prac-
tice for major Hollywood films to con-
tract with the Pentagon to use jets and 
tanks and to film on bases and aircraft 
carriers. 
The SCRIPT Act should be a wake-up 
call for Hollywood. Studios would be 
forced to choose between the assistance 
from the Federal Government or the 
money they want from China. 
The second way the Chinese Govern-
ment attempts to spread propaganda is 
by purchasing access to our cultural 
and educational centers. The Chinese 
Government spends billions of dollars 
to shape what the next generation of 
Americans 
know 
and 
think 
about 
China. They have a pervasive presence 
in our K–12 education and in our col-
leges 
and 
universities, 
especially 
through Confucius Institutes and by di-
rectly financing departments and cen-
ters. 
In the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2019, I au-
thored bipartisan legislation prohib-
iting the Department of Defense from 
funding universities when the money 
could go to Confucius Institutes. As a 
result, over a dozen Confucius Insti-
tutes have closed. 
We need to stand up and deal directly 
with the threat China poses. China 
bears direct responsibility and direct 
culpability for the over 300,000 people 
who have died worldwide and for the 
trillions in economic livelihoods that 
have been destroyed. 
Today, I introduce three pieces of 
legislation to directly address Chinese 
censorship and their responsibility for 
this pandemic, and we, as a body, as a 
bipartisan body, need to stand and 
stand strong protecting U.S. national 
security, protecting the lives of Ameri-
cans, and ensuring accountability; that 
the Chinese Communist Party has ac-
countability for their censorship, their 
hiding of the facts of this pandemic, 
and the lives that have been lost as a 
result of their coverup.

Ms. HASSAN):

tation project delivery, facilitate infra-

note. 
By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself 
and Mr. YOUNG): 
S. 3832. A bill to establish a new Di-
rectorate for Technology in the redes-
ignated National Science and Tech-
nology Foundation, to establish a re-
gional technology hub program, to re-
quire a strategy and report on eco-
nomic security, science, research, and 
innovation, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3832 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Endless 
Frontier Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) For over 70 years, the United States has 
been the unequivocal global leader in sci-
entific and technological innovation, and as 
a result the people of the United States have 
benefitted through good-paying jobs, eco-
nomic prosperity, and a higher quality of 
life. Today, however, this leadership position 
is being eroded and challenged by foreign 
competitors, some of whom are stealing in-
tellectual property and trade secrets of the 
United States and aggressively investing in 
fundamental research and commercialization 
to dominate the key technology fields of the 
future. While the United States once led the 
world in the share of our economy invested 
in research, our Nation now ranks 9th glob-
ally in total research and development and 
12th in publicly financed research and devel-
opment. 
(2) Without a significant increase in in-
vestment in research, education, technology 
transfer, and the core strengths of the 
United States innovation ecosystem, it is 
only a matter of time before the global com-
petitors of the United States overtake the 
United States in terms of technological pri-
macy. The country that wins the race in key 
technologies—such as artificial intelligence, 
quantum computing, advanced communica-
tions, and advanced manufacturing—will be 
the superpower of the future. 
(3) The Federal Government must catalyze 
United States innovation by boosting funda-
mental research investments focused on dis-
covering, creating, commercializing, and 
producing new technologies to ensure the 
leadership of the United States in the indus-
tries of the future. 
(4) The distribution of innovation jobs and 
investment in the United States has become 
largely concentrated in just a few locations, 
while much of the Nation has been left out of 
growth in the innovation sector. More than 
90 percent of the Nation’s innovation sector 
employment growth in the last 15 years was 
generated in just 5 major cities. The Federal 
Government must address this imbalance in 
opportunity by partnering with the private 
sector to build new technology hubs across 
the country, spreading innovation sector

Mrs. LOEFFLER (for herself and Ms. 
ERNST) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 594 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has dis-
rupted the child care market and has re-
sulted in decreased demand for child care, 
closures of child care providers, and unem-
ployment for parents; 
Whereas before the pandemic, many work-
ing families faced challenges of increasing 
costs of child care, and a lack of access to 
child care, including a lack of access in child 
care deserts; 
Whereas in the months before the pan-
demic, the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant program provided access to af-
fordable child care each month to nearly 
850,000 families, and over 1,400,000 children; 
Whereas child care providers have lost sig-
nificant income from families who cannot 
pay and from reduced State reimbursements; 
Whereas in March 2020, in a nationwide 
survey of child care providers, 30 percent of 
the child care providers said they would not 
withstand a closure of more than 2 weeks 
without significant public investment and 
support, an additional 17 percent of the child 
care providers said they would not withstand 
a closure of any amount of time without 
that investment and support, and only 11 
percent of the child care providers were con-
fident they could withstand a closure of an 
indeterminate length without that invest-
ment and support; 
Whereas child care providers that remain 
open are supporting our Nation’s front line 
of defense by providing child care for essen-
tial workers who are first responders, health 
care, public transit, and grocery store work-
ers, and workers in essential industries, and 
who have an estimated 6,000,000 children 
under the age of 13 in need of emergency 
care; 
Whereas those providers are facing chal-
lenges of increased costs for cleaning their 
facilities and providing a safe environment 
for children; 
Whereas 
the 
CARES 
Act 
provided 
$3,500,000,000 for the Child Care and Develop-
ment Block Grant program and much-needed 
relief for families and businesses; 
Whereas 
an 
estimated 
additional 
$25,000,000,000 is still needed for the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant program 
to provide minimum sufficient funds to 
States, ensuring that many child care pro-
viders remain open and many others are able 
to reopen their facilities; and 
Whereas the United States is beginning to 
recover and accessible child care is crucial 
for working parents to return to work: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate calls for— 
(1) significant funds, in addition to the 
amount provided under the CARES Act (Pub-
lic Law 116–136), to be made available 
through payments to States for the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant program; 
and 
(2) those funds to be used for the purposes 
of making maintenance grants for eligible 
child care providers under the Child Care and 
Development Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9858 
et seq.)— 
(A) to support the providers in paying 
costs associated with closures, or decreased 
attendance 
or 
enrollment, 
related 
to 
coronavirus; and 
(B) to assure the providers are able to re-
main open or reopen as appropriate.

KAINE, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
CORNYN, Mr. MARKEY, Mrs. BLACKBURN, 
Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. COLLINS, and Mr. 
CASEY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 595 
Whereas Article 19 of the Universal Dec-
laration of Human Rights, adopted in Paris 
December 10, 1948, states, ‘‘Everyone has the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression; 
this right includes freedom to hold opinions 
without interference and to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers.’’; 
Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly proclaimed May 3rd of each 
year as ‘‘World Press Freedom Day’’— 
(1) to celebrate the fundamental principles 
of freedom of the press; 
(2) to evaluate freedom of the press around 
the world; 
(3) to defend the media against attacks on 
its independence; and 
(4) to pay tribute to journalists who have 
lost their lives while working in their profes-
sion; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United 
Nations General Assembly adopted Resolu-
tion 68/163, regarding the safety of journal-
ists and the issue of impunity for crimes 
against 
journalists, 
which 
unequivocally 
condemns all attacks on, and violence 
against, journalists and media workers, in-
cluding torture, extrajudicial killing, en-
forced disappearance, arbitrary detention, 
and intimidation and harassment in conflict 
and nonconflict situations; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who recognized 
the importance of the press in a constitu-
tional republic, wisely declared, ‘‘were it left 
to me to decide whether we should have a 
government without newspapers, or news-
papers without a government, I should not 
hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.’’; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and various 
State constitutions protect freedom of the 
press in the United States; 
Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the 
Press Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–166; 22 
U.S.C. 2151 note), which was passed by unani-
mous consent in the Senate and signed into 
law by President Barack Obama in 2010, ex-
panded the examination of the freedom of 
the press around the world in the annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of 
the Department of State; 
Whereas a vigilant commitment to free-
dom of the press is especially necessary in 
the wake of the COVID–19 pandemic— 
(1) as governments around the world are 
using emergency laws to restrict access to 
information, impose press restrictions, and 
suppress free speech; and

MCSALLY, Mr. PETERS, Mr. WICKER, 
Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mr. SULLIVAN, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. INHOFE, and Mr. DAINES) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 596 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China has proposed a new na-
tional security law for Hong Kong that 
would ban secession, subversion of state 
power, and foreign interference, as defined 
by the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China; 
Whereas, if the new national security law 
is passed, the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China is expected to use this law 
to justify and facilitate an expanded crack-
down against peaceful protests and other 
forms of nonviolent protest by the people of 
Hong Kong; 
Whereas this proposed law constitutes a 
significant escalation in the campaign by 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China and its proxies in Hong Kong to erase 
the basic liberties and human rights prom-
ised to the people of Hong Kong under the 
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 
Hong Kong Basic Law; 
Whereas the announcement by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China of its 
intent to pass this new national security law 
reflects that government’s fundamental op-
position not only to the basic rights and lib-
erties of free persons championed by the peo-
ple of Hong Kong and the United States, but 
also to upholding its obligations under inter-
national law; and 
Whereas the efforts by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China to silence 
peaceful protestors in Hong Kong are part 
and parcel of a broader hegemonic vision 
that would see the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China impose its will upon 
all free people of Asia and beyond: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the Hong Kong national security law 
proposed by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China would violate the legal ob-
ligations of that government under—

MCSALLY, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. RUBIO, 
Ms. WARREN, Mr. HAWLEY, Ms. SINEMA, 
Mr. BRAUN, Ms. ROSEN, Mr. SCOTT of 
Florida, and Mr. GRASSLEY) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 597 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy first 
designated May as ‘‘Senior Citizens Month’’ 
in 1963; 
Whereas, 
in 
1963, 
only 
approximately 
17,778,000 individuals living in the United 
States were 65 years of age or older, approxi-
mately 1⁄3 of those individuals lived in pov-
erty, and few programs existed to meet the 
needs of older individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas, in 2019, there were more than 
55,030,278 individuals who were 65 years of 
age or older in the United States, and those 
individuals accounted for 16.7 percent of the 
total population of the United States; 
Whereas approximately 10,000 individuals 
in the United States turn 65 years of age 
each day; 
Whereas, in 2019, more than 9,056,000 vet-
erans of the Armed Forces were 65 years of 
age or older; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States rely on Federal programs, such as 
programs under the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.), including the Medicare 
program under title XVIII of that Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid program 
under title XIX of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
seq.), for financial security and high-quality 
affordable health care; 
Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 
(42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) provides— 
(1) supportive services to help individuals 
in the United States who are 60 years of age 
or older maintain maximum independence in 
the homes and communities of those individ-
uals; and 
(2) funding for programs, including nutri-
tion services, transportation, and care man-
agement, to assist more than 10,798,199 older 
individuals in the United States each year; 
Whereas, compared to older individuals in 
the United States in past generations, older 
individuals in the United States in 2020 are 
working longer, living longer, and enjoying 
healthier, more active, and more inde-
pendent lifestyles; 
Whereas, in 2019, an estimated 6,422,000 in-
dividuals in the United States who were 65 
years of age or older continued to work as 
full-time, year-round employees; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States play an important role in society by 
continuing to contribute their experience, 
knowledge, wisdom, and accomplishments; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States play vital roles in their communities 
and remain involved in volunteer work, the 
arts, cultural activities, and activities relat-
ing to mentorship and civic engagement; and 
Whereas a society that recognizes the suc-
cess of older individuals and continues to en-
hance the access of older individuals to qual-
ity and affordable health care will— 
(1) encourage the ongoing participation 
and heightened independence of older indi-
viduals; and 
(2) ensure the continued safety and well- 
being of older individuals: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2020 as ‘‘Older Ameri-
cans Month’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to provide opportunities for older in-
dividuals to continue to flourish by— 
(A) emphasizing the importance and lead-
ership of older individuals through public 
recognition of the ongoing achievements of 
older individuals; 
(B) presenting opportunities for older indi-
viduals to share their wisdom, experience, 
and skills with younger generations; and 
(C) recognizing older individuals as valu-
able assets in strengthening communities 
across the United States.

S. RES. 598 
Whereas National Foster Care Month was 
established more than 30 years ago to— 
(1) bring foster care issues to the forefront; 
(2) highlight the importance of perma-
nency for every child; and 
(3) recognize the essential role that foster 
parents, social workers, and advocates have 
in the lives of children in foster care 
throughout the United States; 
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, 
and permanent home; 
Whereas the primary goal of the foster 
care system is to ensure the safety and well- 
being of children while working to provide a 
safe, loving, and permanent home for each 
child; 
Whereas there are approximately 437,000 
children living in foster care; 
Whereas there were approximately 263,000 
youth that entered the foster care system in 
2018, while more than 71,000 youth were eligi-
ble and awaiting adoption at the end of 2018; 
Whereas the number of children living in 
foster care has increased dramatically in re-
cent years; 
Whereas more than 94,000 children entered 
foster care in 2018 due to parental drug 
abuse; 
Whereas children of color are more likely 
to stay in the foster care system for longer 
periods of time and are less likely to be re-
united with their biological families; 
Whereas foster parents— 
(1) are the front-line caregivers for chil-
dren who cannot safely remain with their bi-
ological parents; 
(2) provide physical care, emotional sup-
port, and education advocacy; and 
(3) are the largest single source of families 
providing permanent homes for children 
leaving foster care to adoption; 
Whereas, compared to children in foster 
care who are placed with nonrelatives, chil-
dren in foster care who are placed with rel-
atives have more stability, including fewer 
changes in placements, have more positive 
perceptions of their placements, are more 
likely to be placed with their siblings, and 
demonstrate fewer behavioral problems; 
Whereas some relative caregivers receive 
less financial assistance and support services 
than do foster caregivers; 
Whereas an increased emphasis on preven-
tion and reunification services is necessary 
to reduce the number of children that are 
forced to remain in the foster care system; 
Whereas almost 18,000 youth ‘‘aged out’’ of 
foster care in 2018 without a legal permanent 
connection to an adult or family; 
Whereas children who age out of foster 
care lack the security or support of a bio-
logical or adoptive family and frequently 
struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain 
health insurance, pursue higher education, 
and acquire adequate employment; 
Whereas foster care is intended to be a 
temporary placement, but children remain 
in the foster care system for an average of 19 
months; 
Whereas 34 percent of children in foster 
care experience more than 2 placements 
while in foster care, which often leads to dis-
ruption of routines and the need to change 
schools and move away from siblings, ex-
tended families, and familiar surroundings; 
Whereas youth in foster care are much 
more likely to face educational instability, 
with 1 study showing that 75 percent of fos-
ter youth experienced an unscheduled school 
change during a school year, compared to 21 
percent of youth not in foster care; 
Whereas children entering foster care often 
confront the widespread misperception that 
children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, 
and dangerous, even though placement in 
foster care is based on the actions of a par-
ent or guardian, not the child; 
Whereas 30 percent of children in foster 
care are taking at least 1 antipsychotic 
medication, and 34 percent of those children 
are not receiving adequate treatment plan-
ning or medication monitoring; 
Whereas, due to heavy caseloads and lim-
ited resources, the average turnover rate for 
child welfare workers is 30 percent; 
Whereas States, localities, and commu-
nities should be encouraged to invest re-
sources in preventative and reunification 
services and postpermanency programs to 
ensure that more children in foster care are

provided with safe, loving, and permanent 
placements; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress passed the Fam-
ily First Prevention Services Act (Public 
Law 115–123; 132 Stat. 232), which provided 
new investments in prevention and family 
reunification services to help more families 
stay together and ensure that more children 
are in safe, loving, and permanent homes; 
Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 
decades, including the Adoption Assistance 
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Public Law 96– 
272; 94 Stat. 500), the Adoption and Safe Fam-
ilies Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–89; 111 Stat. 
2115), the Fostering Connections to Success 
and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public 
Law 110–351; 122 Stat. 3949), the Child and 
Family Services Improvement and Innova-
tion Act (Public Law 112–34; 125 Stat. 369), 
and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and 
Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113– 
183; 128 Stat. 1919), provided new investments 
and services to improve the outcomes of 
children in the foster care system; 
Whereas May 2020 is an appropriate month 
to designate as National Foster Care Month 
to provide an opportunity to acknowledge 
the accomplishments of the child welfare 
workforce, foster parents, the advocacy com-
munity, and mentors for their dedication 
and accomplishments and the positive im-
pact they have on the lives of children; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to en-
sure that all children have a safe, loving, 
nurturing, and permanent family, regardless 
of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of National 
Foster Care Month; 
(2) recognizes National Foster Care Month 
as an opportunity to raise awareness about 
the challenges that children face in the fos-
ter care system; 
(3) encourages Congress to implement poli-
cies to improve the lives of children in the 
foster care system; 
(4) acknowledges the unique needs of chil-
dren in the foster care system; 
(5) recognizes foster youth throughout the 
United States for their ongoing tenacity, 
courage, and resilience while facing life chal-
lenges; 
(6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of 
the foster care system who serve as advo-
cates and role models for youth who remain 
in foster care; 
(7) honors the commitment and dedication 
of the individuals who work tirelessly to pro-
vide assistance and services to children in 
the foster care system; 
(8) supports the designation of May 31, 2020, 
as National Foster Parent Appreciation Day; 
(9) recognizes National Foster Parent Ap-
preciation Day as an opportunity— 
(A) to recognize the efforts of foster par-
ents to provide safe and loving care for chil-
dren in need; and 
(B) to raise awareness about the increasing 
need for foster parents to serve in their com-
munities; and 
(10) reaffirms the need to continue working 
to improve the outcomes of all children in 
the foster care system through parts B and E 
of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs de-
signed to— 
(A) support vulnerable families; 
(B) invest in prevention and reunification 
services; 
(C) promote adoption in cases where reuni-
fication is not in the best interests of the 
child; 
(D) adequately serve children brought into 
the foster care system; and 
(E) facilitate the successful transition into 
adulthood for children that ‘‘age out’’ of the 
foster care system.

Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. COLLINS, and Mr. 
CASEY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 600 
Whereas Article 19 of the Universal Dec-
laration of Human Rights, adopted in Paris 
December 10, 1948, states, ‘‘Everyone has the

media and regardless of frontiers.’’;

unequivocally 
condemns all attacks on, and violence 
against, journalists and media workers, in-
cluding torture, extrajudicial killing, en-
forced disappearance, arbitrary detention, 
and intimidation and harassment in conflict 
and nonconflict situations; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who recognized

TRIBUTE TO SHARON LONG 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday, one of my favorite times of 
the week, because it is the time I get 
to come to the Senate floor and recog-
nize an extraordinary Alaskan whom 
we refer to as the Alaskan of the Week. 
Now, Memorial Day is fast approach-
ing. It is certainly one of the most sa-
cred days in our Nation throughout the 
year. For this week’s Alaskan of the 
Week, Sharon Long, it is a day that is 
a particularly profound day. 
Sharon Long is a Gold Star mother 
who lives in Anchorage, and she re-
members her son, Grant Fraser, every 
day of the year. For her and her family 
and for so many people who knew 
Grant and who served with Grant, Me-
morial Day is a day when his memory 
is particularly honored. 
Before I get into Sharon Long’s 
story, as well as the remarkable story 
of her son Grant, let me talk a little 
bit about what is going on in Alaska 
right now as we, in our country, con-
tinue to face the challenges of this pan-
demic. 
We are doing pretty well in our 
State, medically, certainly. Things 
could, of course, change quickly. We 
remain vigilant as a State, but the 
number of people infected by the virus 
is very low. Businesses are starting to 
reopen. Life, by no means, is back to 
normal, and there is much that we are 
going to need to do to recover from 
this virus and pandemic, which has 
very, very negatively impacted so 
many parts of the great State of Alas-
ka’s economy—the energy sector, tour-
ism sector, fishery sector. We will get 
through this stronger and more resil-
ient, but it is a challenging time. 
As you know, Memorial Day weekend 
commemorates many virtues in our 
Nation: service, selflessness, and, of 
course, sacrifice. But Memorial Day 
also commemorates and inspires hope. 
I know hope can be a bit hard to come 
by during these challenging times, but 
I don’t think we have to go very far to 
see signs of hope. 
In our great Nation and in my great 
State, hope is in the faces of those we 
love. In Alaska, it is in our mountains 
and our glaciers and our clear waters. 
It is also woven into the fabric of our 
country and the soul of our Nation. It 
is at the very heart of who we are, and 
it has been so throughout our history, 
often manifesting itself in the battles 
that have shaped our Nation over dec-
ades and over centuries that define so 
much of the American character and 
the people who fought those battles 
and died defending their Nation whom 
we commemorate this weekend. Hope 
is what Sharon Long and other Gold 
Star mothers throughout our State and 
Nation who have lost a child while de-
fending America have to offer us. 
So let me tell you about Sharon’s 
story and about her son, Marine Corps 
LCpl Grant Fraser, who gave his life 
for this Nation. From Seattle, Sharon 
moved to our State to live with her 
aunt and uncle when she was just 16 
years old. She graduated from West 
High School in Anchorage, studied po-
litical science at Alaska Methodist 
University, which is now Alaska Pa-
cific University, and embraced the 
great State of Alaska with everything 
she had. 
It was a heady and exciting time in 
Alaska. Prudhoe Bay Oil Field on the 
North Slope was just discovered—the 
biggest oilfield in North America. This 
is the late 1960s, early 1970s. The Alas-
ka Native Claims Settlement Act, one 
of the biggest land claims acts in U.S. 
history, was being debated and then 
passed right here on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. 
Sharon said: Alaska was a wide open 
place that wanted the energy of my 
generation. She got to work. She 
worked at the Department of Natural 
Resources, an agency that I had the 
honor of being the former commis-
sioner of. She worked for the Joint 
Federal-State Land Use Planning Com-
mission for Alaska, inventorying the 
abundant world-class natural resources 
we have in our State. 
Then she and a girlfriend traveled 
the world for a year and landed at the 
end of her tour in DC. She was young, 
broke, on a friend’s couch, and she 
came here and asked for and got a job 
with former Alaska U.S. Senator Mike 
Gravel. Some might remember Senator 
Gravel here in the Senate. She worked 
on natural resource issues for him. 
Eventually, she made her way back 
home to Alaska and met her husband,

May 21, 2020 
an Air Force anesthesiologist, James 
Fraser, who made his way into private 
practice. Sharon helped run the office, 
and they had two wonderful children, 
Grant and Victoria. 
So who is Grant Fraser? Her son. He 
was popular at Service High School in 
Anchorage, where he graduated. He was 
an actor who loved the works of Homer 
and Shakespeare. He was a mountain 
biker, a skier, a pianist, a scuba diver, 
a rock climber, and a tennis player. He 
was lighthearted and mischievous, and 
according to his marine brothers, the 
only thing that could really rile him up 
was when they talked about his sister 
the way in which sometimes marines, 
unfortunately, have the habit of doing. 
He was a fiercely loyal brother. You 
could not joke about his sister Vic-
toria, who, by the way, now is a profes-
sional soprano singer who has per-
formed all over the world. 
So Sharon and her husband James as-
sumed that Grant would become an 
athlete, maybe, or a scholar. He was a 
very, very smart young man. But 
shortly after 9/11, like so many patri-
otic young Americans across our Na-
tion, he surprised his family and his 
friends when he announced he was join-
ing the marines. ‘‘No, no, no, no,’’ 
Sharon told her son. ‘‘That isn’t the 
plan. You are going to school now.’’ 
He told his mom: ‘‘Mom, this isn’t 
my scholarly time of life. I am ready to 
serve and fight for my country, if need 
be.’’ 
He knew he would thrive in the Ma-
rines, and he did. He planned on com-
ing back home in Anchorage to work as 
a paramedic with the fire department. 
Grant and I briefly overlapped in the 
Marine Corps unit. We both served in 
Alaska, Echo Company, 4th Reconnais-
sance Battalion, which was later de-
ployed to Iraq in 2005. 
On August 3, 2005, in Anbar Province, 
Iraq, Grant was on a mission, Oper-
ation Quick Strike, to avenge the kill-
ing of his fellow marines that had hap-
pened just a few days earlier. He was 
riding in an AmTrac vehicle on an at-
tack into the city, hit a massive impro-
vised explosive device, and was 22 years 
old when he made the ultimate sac-
rifice for our Nation. 
Now, I love our military, but let’s 
face it; sometimes it can be bureau-
cratic and boneheaded. It took 11 years 
and tenacious work on the part of 
Grant’s amazing mother Sharon to fi-
nally get her son an appropriate burial 
across the street at Arlington. 
Just 2 days before the funeral, I was 
sitting next to Gen. Joe Dunford, the 
Marine Corps Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, at a dinner. I told Gen-
eral Dunford about Grant’s heroism 
and about Sharon Long’s heroic perse-
verance to get her son appropriately 
honored with a burial at Arlington. 
On an overcast day, September 30, 
2016, Grant Fraser was put to rest 
among his brothers and sisters, our Na-
tion’s heroes, whom we honor this 
weekend at Arlington National Ceme-
tery. Family, friends, and especially 
U.S. marines from all across America 
came to that service to say goodbye to 
their friend. I was there, and when I 
got there, I was honored to see many 
marines. One, in particular, came to 
the funeral early and stayed till the 
very end. The Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs, General Dunford, attended in 
his dress blues out of respect for this 
young Marine Corps lance corporal. 
He later told me that when he read 
about what happened with Grant, he 
couldn’t sleep. He wanted to be at the 
funeral to honor Grant’s sacrifice and 
that of his family, especially his moth-
er Sharon. General Dunford stayed 
after most others had left to talk to 
Sharon Long, Grant’s mother, and his 
Marine Corps brothers. ‘‘I don’t live 
very far from here,’’ the General told 
Sharon. ‘‘I will be checking in on Grant 
from time to time.’’ 
Now, I have been to a lot of funerals 
in my Marine Corps career, but this 
was the most moving funeral I have 
ever attended. It was not because of 
the presence of a four-star general and 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General 
Dunford, the most powerful U.S. mili-
tary officer in America—in the world, 
really—and not because of the ser-
endipitous presence of the Marine cap-
tain in charge of the Arlington burial 
honor guard, whose twin brother was 
one of the fallen marines whom Grant 
Fraser had been sent to avenge the day 
he was killed 11 years earlier. It was so 
moving on that day because, on that 
day, rank didn’t matter, and medals 
didn’t matter. That day we were all 
just Americans grieving the loss of one 
of our own: mischievous, smart, Marine 
Corps LCpl Grant Fraser, an actor, an 
Alaskan, a brother, a son. It was so 
moving because of the dignity, grace, 
and beautiful determination exhibited 
by Sharon Long, who epitomizes the 
love, suffering, and quiet sacrifice of so 
many Gold Star mothers across our 
country, especially this weekend. 
Sharon stays in touch with Grant’s 
Marine Corps brothers. They call her 
on Mother’s Day. They send her flow-
ers, invite her to their weddings and to 
their kids’ birthday parties. Two of 
them showed up at their family home 
when 
Sharon’s 
daughter, 
Victoria, 
whom we already talked about, and her 
date were headed to prom. They needed 
to make sure Grant would have ap-
proved of Victoria’s date. I am sure 
Victoria appreciated that. 
Grant would have been in the same 
place in life as these young men are 
now. As one of them said to Sharon: I 
came back home from Iraq to live the 
life Grant couldn’t. 
Sharon is proud of all the men and 
women who have served, who served 
with Grant and continue to serve. She 
understands their calling. She under-
stands their camaraderie. These incred-
ible warriors in our Nation give her 
hope. 
With men and women like these, 
Sharon said: ‘‘How can you not be 
proud of this country? How can you not 
be optimistic about this country?’’ 
The lives of hundreds of thousands of 
America’s sons and daughters have 
been lost in fighting for our great Na-
tion, and on Memorial Day, they are in 
the hearts of all Americans. They are 
in the hearts of all Alaskans. They are 
in the hearts of all Gold Star families, 
and they are in the hearts of Sharon 
Long and her family. 
Like Gold Star mothers all across 
the country and in our great State, 
Sharon was fiercely determined to ad-
vocate for her son. She sacrificed much 
but never gave up, and neither will we 
ever give up on them, on him, or their 
memory, which we commemorate this 
weekend. 
Sharon Long’s actions recalled the 
Memorial 
Day 
words 
of 
President 
Reagan in 1985 after placing a wreath 
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a 
place that is not far from Grant Fra-
ser’s eternal resting place. As Presi-
dent Reagan said: 
If words cannot repay the debt we owe 
these men [and women], surely with our ac-
tions we must strive to keep faith with them 
and with the vision that led them to battle 
and final sacrifice. 
Our first obligation to them and ourselves 
is plain enough: The United States and the 
freedom for which it stands, the freedom for 
which they died, must endure and prosper. 
Their lives remind us that freedom is not 
bought cheaply. It has a cost; it imposes a 
burden. And just as they whom we com-
memorate were willing to sacrifice so much, 
so too must we—in a less final, less heroic 
way—be willing to give of ourselves [for our 
Nation]. 
Thank you, Sharon Long, for your 
brave sacrifice, for your dignified de-
termination, and for your hope, which 
gives us hope. As we head into another 
sacred Memorial Day weekend, thank 
you for being our Alaskan of the Week. 
f 
DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I will 
speak now about the Due Process Pro-
tections Act, which was sponsored by 
myself and Senator DURBIN from Illi-
nois and which passed the U.S. Senate 
last night unanimously. I thank my 
colleagues for their support for this 
simple but important bill. 
In fact, the Due Process Protections 
Act is so simple that it really probably 
shouldn’t be necessary, but believe me, 
it is necessary. Unfortunately, it is 
necessary. I was pleased that this body 
passed it last night. 
Let me explain. The due process 
clause of the U.S. Constitution, as in-
terpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
the landmark decision, Brady v. Mary-
land, requires that prosecutors turn 
over all material evidence favorable to 
the defense. That is what a fair trial is 
about. If the prosecutor has excul-
patory evidence, as we call it, you need 
to make sure the defense has it. This is 
such a bedrock element of our criminal 
justice system and constitutional due 
process that the name of this kind of 
evidence is simply now called ‘‘Brady 
evidence’’ after the case Brady v. 
Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2612 
May 21, 2020 
Now, the vast majority of Federal 
prosecutors—and, by the way, FBI 
agents—who work in our criminal jus-
tice system are patriots. Many are vet-
erans, and they work day in and day 
out to keep us safe and abide by their 
constitutional duties and obligations. 
They do turn Brady evidence over to 
the defense, as they are required to do 
by the Constitution. 
The sad fact is, some prosecutors 
don’t do this. Some choose instead to 
win at all costs by taking shortcuts— 
not justice, but shortcuts. And when I 
say shortcuts, I am talking about vio-
lating 
a 
defendant’s 
constitutional 
rights. The prevalence of these viola-
tions is not easy to quantify—these 
Brady violations, as we call them. 
One study—and I am not vouching for 
the accuracy, and this was a study 
called the National Registry of Exon-
erations—stated that from 1989 to 2017, 
prosecutors concealed exculpatory evi-
dence at trial in half of all murder ex-
onerations. If that statistic is even re-
motely true, it is outrageous and needs 
to stop. 
Such 
potential 
Brady 
violations 
have, once again, been in the news with 
the prosecution of former National Se-
curity Advisor Michael Flynn—GEN 
Michael Flynn. There are all kinds of 
articles now out there. I recently wrote 
the head of the FBI on this very issue 
about the potential Brady violations 
by Federal prosecutors that appear to 
have taken place in this prosecution. 
What that has done in my State is that 
it 
has 
opened 
old 
wounds—old 
wounds—and difficult memories. 
My colleagues here—every single one 
of them—remember the late, great 
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. As a 
matter of fact, his portrait is right off 
of the Senate floor, an incredible new 
portrait that we just put there re-
cently. He was charged by Federal 
prosecutors with making false state-
ments and was convicted prior to his 
reelection, which he lost because of the 
conviction by prosecutors. 
Not long after the conviction, it 
started to become apparent that there 
was prosecutorial misconduct in that 
very high-profile case, so the trial 
judge in that case appointed a special 
prosecutor to investigate this. There 
was a report that came out in 2012 by 
the Justice Department, by the special 
prosecutor, that was highly critical of 
the prosecutors’ and the FBI’s conduct. 
In particular, they withheld all kinds 
of Brady evidence. 
Just 6 months after Senator Stevens’ 
conviction, it was revealed that Fed-
eral prosecutors had concealed numer-
ous pieces of evidence that very likely 
could have resulted in his acquittal. 
Among the more egregious examples— 
and there were many—rather than call 
a witness whose testimony would have 
supported Senator Stevens, the govern-
ment flew the witness home to Alaska. 
That is pretty pathetic. 
The prosecution also concealed that 
its star witness, who was testifying 
against Senator Stevens, had an illegal 
sexual relationship with an underage 
woman whom he had asked to lie about 
the relationship. And to this day—to 
this very day—there are still questions 
about whether the Federal Government 
offered that star witness, in exchange 
for his testimony, leniency on not pros-
ecuting him for violating the Mann 
Act. There are still questions to this 
day. 
The special prosecutor that the dis-
trict judge appointed to investigate the 
prosecutorial misconduct in the Ste-
vens case found that the Justice De-
partment lawyers had committed ‘‘de-
liberate and ‘systematic’ ethical viola-
tions by withholding critical evidence 
pointing to Senator Stevens’ inno-
cence.’’ That is the Justice Department 
special prosecutor determining just 
how corrupt the Justice Department 
was in prosecuting and convicting Ted 
Stevens. 
Yet the special prosecutor, who in-
vestigated all of this also, found that 
the district court judge was powerless 
to act against the wrongdoers—the cor-
rupt prosecutors—because the district 
court had not issued a direct, written 
court order at the beginning of the 
trial, requiring the prosecutors to 
abide by their ethical and constitu-
tional obligations as laid out in Brady 
v. Maryland. 
It is a bit remarkable because every 
law student knows you learn Brady v. 
Maryland the first year of law school. 
But somehow these prosecutors across 
the street over at the Justice Depart-
ment forgot about it, and they were 
going to be punished. But the system of 
justice said that you couldn’t punish 
them because they didn’t know because 
the judge didn’t tell them. 
Again, I am not sure we even need a 
law to deal with this, but, as I said, un-
fortunately, we do. 
As you can imagine, it was mad-
dening to the people of Alaska that 
those who violated Senator Stevens’ 
constitutional rights—and, by the way, 
forever changed the political land-
scape, not just in Alaska but in Amer-
ica; don’t get me going about what 
happened 
there—these 
prosecutors 
couldn’t even be held accountable and 
were not held accountable because they 
weren’t instructed by the district court 
about the Brady evidence requirements 
that they learned in law school in their 
first year. 
So in response to the Stevens case 
and due to growing concerns about the 
unfortunate frequency of Brady evi-
dence violations by prosecutors, a 
number 
of 
Federal 
district 
judges 
began issuing specific local rules or 
standing orders that explicitly remind 
prosecutors of what they learned their 
first year of law school, which is that 
you have to turn over Brady evidence. 
But 
the 
Federal 
Judicial 
Con-
ference’s Advisory Committee on the 
Rules of Criminal Procedure—so, essen-
tially, the judges who advise on the 
rules—has consistently declined to re-
quire all Federal courts to do the same. 
So right now, all Federal courts don’t 
have to issue instructions on Brady 
evidence. 
Well, today, Congress is beginning to 
change all of this. My bill, which 
passed last night unanimously—the 
Due Process Protections Act—codifies 
this practice and requires it of every 
Federal judge nationwide by amending 
rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure to require that a judge 
‘‘issue an oral or written order to pros-
ecution and defense counsel that con-
firms the disclosure obligation of the 
prosecutor under Brady v. Maryland 
. . . and its progeny’’—that is quoting 
from my bill—at the beginning of every 
criminal case. 
Our bill allows each judicial district 
flexibility to promulgate their own 
model rule, but they have to do it. Con-
gress is telling them they have to do it, 
so they will do it. 
Having this standing order in place 
will explicitly remind the prosecution 
of their obligations—making it a pri-
ority to protect the due process of all 
Americans, including defendants—and 
it will provide for quicker recourse 
upon discovering any Brady violations 
that occur. 
We obviously can’t undo what hap-
pened to the late, great Senator Ste-
vens, nor can we undo all the harm it 
caused to my State, my constituents, 
and, really, the people across America 
who have also been victims of these 
kinds of violations because it under-
mines trust in our system of justice. 
But going forward, we can work to 
stem the corrosive effects to our de-
mocracy when prosecutors don’t abide 
by their constitutional obligations. We 
can work to ensure our system of jus-
tice—the foundation of American de-
mocracy—is stronger and fairer for all, 
and that is what the Due Process Pro-
tections Act will do. 
I want to thank chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
for helping to facilitate this bill’s pas-
sage; my colleague Senator DURBIN, 
who was my original cosponsor of this 
bill; and the other cosponsors: Senators 
LEE from Utah, BOOKER from New Jer-
sey, CORNYN from Texas, WHITEHOUSE 
from Rhode Island, and PAUL from Ken-
tucky. I say to the Presiding Officer, 
you know those Senators. That is 
about as broad a political array in 
terms of the political spectrum in 
America and the U.S. Senate—Demo-
crats and Republicans who believe in 
this issue, and that is why I think it is 
so important. 
Our system of justice will be fairer 
once that bill passes the House and is 
signed into law by the President. I just 
want to thank my colleagues—all of 
my colleagues—who voted for this nec-
essary and important and simple piece 
of legislation that, unfortunately, we 
need in America today. 
I yield the floor.
