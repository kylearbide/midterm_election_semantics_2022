DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
April 15, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable ANGIE

Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Blessed are we who trust in the Lord. 
But O God, trust is so hard for us to 
master. We trust that You have called 
us here—but do we? For if we did, we 
would be as content as a tree planted 
by water. And yet, we find that when 
the heat comes—the heat of our mo-
ments, the heat of our anger—inwardly 
we find ourselves thirsty for respite, 
fearful for ourselves and our survival. 
May we, in these moments, lean not 
on our own understanding—our own 
perceptions of progress, purpose, and 
success—but may we submit ourselves, 
our whole being over to You that You 
would make straight the paths we 
should take. 
Lift up our eyes that we would see 
and take the opportunity to appreciate 
those who travel with us on this path 
called life. May we trust You enough to 
trust them—even when they seem 
geared up for a different journey, with 
different challenges. Nonetheless, You, 
in Your providence, have directed that 
our paths be joined. 
Help us to trust that our fellow so-
journers are companions You have pro-
vided to cajole and comfort, to spar 
with and support along the way, but al-
ways partners in service to You. 
Grant that we would find ways to 
trust and love each other, that to-
gether we will unite our resources until 
You bring us, when our work is done, 
together in Your loving embrace. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. LEE) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Ms. Kaitlyn 
Roberts, one of his secretaries. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
The gentleman will put his mask 
back on. 
f 
HONORING SHAWN FRIEDKIN 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Shawn Friedkin, a pas-
sionate advocate for people with dis-
abilities, whose life was cut short after 
a courageous battle with cancer. John 
Friedkin was my friend, and we were 
kindred spirits. 
At the age of 27, Shawn was in a car 
accident that left him paralyzed. In-
stead of allowing that experience to de-
feat him, he used it to help others over-
come their own obstacles and reach 
their full potential. 
In 1997, he founded Stand Among 
Friends, a nonprofit dedicated to im-
proving the quality of life for people 
with spinal cord injuries, and more 
broadly, improving employment out-
comes so that people with disabilities 
can live ‘‘life without limits.’’ That 
was Shawn’s philosophy, ‘‘a life with-
out limits,’’ and he applied it to every-
thing he did. 
Whether 
providing 
assistance 
through Stand Among Friends, estab-
lishing a disability resource center at 
Florida Atlantic University, or advo-
cating for legislation in Congress, 
Shawn demonstrated his unwavering 
commitment to improving the quality 
of life for individuals with disabilities 
everywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to call 
Shawn a friend. Although his life was 
cut far too short, his legacy will live on 
through his work and his loving fam-
ily. 
f 
BRIGADE 2506 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 60th anni-
versary of the Bay of Pigs invasion; 
specifically, to honor the men of As-
sault Brigade 2506.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1796 
April 15, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, over 1,400 selfless men— 
many of which were only teenagers at 
the time—volunteered to save the is-
land of Cuba on April 17, 1961 from 
communism. 
Mr. Speaker, 114 brigaders and 4 
American soldiers were killed in action 
by the brutal Castro regime; while 
thousands of others waiting on the is-
land for these freedom fighters were ar-
rested, killed by a firing squad, or sent 
into exile, including my grandmother. 
For my Miami exile community that 
I represent, these are our moral points 
of reference, our heroes, and are re-
minders of how the Cuban people con-
tinue to suffer under a ruthless com-
munist dictatorship led by the Castro 
brothers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Con-
gressman MARIO DIAZ-BALART in intro-
ducing a bipartisan resolution hon-
oring the brigaders. I urge my col-
leagues in Congress to cosponsor our 
resolution to join us in our fight for 
freedom, democracy, and human rights 
in the only communist bastion in the 
Western Hemisphere, the island of 
Cuba. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the hundreds of 
thousands of Nevadans who are still 
struggling to put food on the table. 
I rise for those who can’t bear to look 
their children in the eye when they are 
asked, ‘‘What’s for dinner.’’ 
Right now, in my home State of Ne-
vada, where our economy has been dev-
astated by this pandemic, 304,000 adults 
say that they don’t have enough food 
to eat. Of that, 132,000 say that their 
children don’t have enough to eat. This 
is entirely unacceptable. There is no 
excuse for a child to go hungry in our 
country. 
But I am glad to say that help is 
here. 
The American Rescue Plan will cut 
child poverty in half through pay-
ments, bolster child tax credits, and 
the expansion of food assistance pro-
grams. For the first time in a long 
time, millions of children across this 
country will be lifted out of poverty 
and allowed a stable and secure child-
hood. 
We all know that our children are 
our future, and the smartest invest-
ment we can make is in them, which is 
just one of the many reasons I am 
proud to support the American Rescue 
Plan. 
f 
BORDER WEEK 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the southern border. Presi-
dent Biden’s policies paved the way for 
this full-scale crisis. He promised out-
right citizenship to more than 11 mil-
lion illegal immigrants, placed a mora-
torium on deportations, and halted 
border wall construction. 
I went to the southern border to wit-
ness firsthand this crisis last week: 
I saw scared children. Under the 
Biden administration, Mexican cartels 
are the winners, and innocent children 
are the losers. Cartels are making hun-
dreds of millions of dollars exploiting 
children as the daily average of unac-
companied minors crossing the border 
has nearly doubled. 
I saw overcrowded facilities and over-
whelmed Customs and Border Patrol 
agents. Texas migrant facilities are 
well over 700 percent capacity, and 40 
percent of our agents are being pulled 
away from border control to process 
unaccompanied children. 
I watched agents place $8 million 
worth of methamphetamine, cartel- 
smuggled drugs, on a table, and I 
learned that the cartel would throw 
migrant children in the Rio Grande as 
a distraction to avoid being appre-
hended. 
We must end these disastrous, no- 
consequence policies, secure our border 
through a physical barrier, enhanced 
technology, and patrol agents, and ad-
here to and modernize our country’s 
immigration system. 
f 
RELIEF FOR ADULT-DISABLED 
DEPENDENTS 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, last year, 
the CARES Act delivered relief checks 
to millions, but families were dis-
appointed to learn that their dependent 
adult children weren’t eligible to re-
ceive support, including the Harris 
family in Eagan, Minnesota. 
Debbie and Victor Harris are proud 
parents to their wonderful son, Josh, 
who has complex medical needs. Ex-
penses are constant for the Harris fam-
ily. Home-care nurses and their two 
grown sons provide 24-hour care for 
Josh. Despite that, as an adult-disabled 
dependent, Josh didn’t qualify for re-
lief. 
It was because of stories like these 
that I introduced the All Dependent 
Children Count Act and pushed to en-
sure that Josh and millions of other de-
pendent adult children could receive 
the relief they deserve. 
I am so proud we were finally able to 
get this in the American Rescue Plan 
and give families like the Harrises an 
additional $1,400, allowing them the 
freedom and support to enjoy some 
well-deserved 
time 
in 
Minnesota’s 
great outdoors. 
f 
REMEMBERING JAMES R. CASH 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, as a young 
farmer, I knew of James R. Cash at an 
early age. He was a legend in the agri-
culture community and a household 
name in west Kentucky. His farm auc-
tions were always the highest grossing 
sales anywhere and regularly attended 
by farmers from six States. 
As an aspiring politician, James R., 
Cindy, and Caroline took me in and 
were instrumental in the development 
of my organization in west Kentucky. 
James R. always put my campaign 
signs up all over my very large Con-
gressional district—especially en route 
to Fancy Farm. He hosted events, do-
nated money, offered advice, and al-
ways allowed me to stay in his guest 
house. 
James R. Cash was extremely suc-
cessful in business and life. His great 
legacy will live on in his three chil-
dren. I am extremely pleased to work 
in Washington with Caroline, who defi-
nitely inherited her father’s intel-
ligence, patience, and management 
skills. West Kentucky has lost a great 
entrepreneur, father, husband, and role 
model. 
James R. Cash will be deeply missed 
by everyone who ever knew him. 
f 
MEDFIELD MODEL 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Medfield 
Model as a national exemplar for re-
turning kids to full, in-person learning. 
By following the latest public health 
guidance, drawing on the best science 
and technology, and building trust 
across students, teachers, administra-
tors, parents, and nurses, the Medfield 
Public Schools are returning to full, in- 
person learning safely. At a recent 
visit, I watched nurses test and screen 
students with minimal disruption and 
felt firsthand the palpable relief among 
the students and teachers to be back in 
the classroom. 
For 
their 
academic 
and 
socioemotional growth, our students 
deserve an education off Zoom and in 
the classroom. 
Mr. Speaker, the Medfield Model 
shows that we can keep students phys-
ically and mentally healthy. I am 
pleased to see schools in my district 
leading the way. 
f 
BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. GOSAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, 30 days 
ago, I invited Mr. Biden to Yuma Coun-
ty in my district to view firsthand the 
crisis his open border policies have cre-
ated. 
My invitation was as urgent as it was 
sincere. 
The crisis all along the southern bor-
der 
has 
only 
gotten 
substantially 
worse. Illegal alien crossings are at a

15-year high; border facilities are 1,700 
percent over capacity; 5,000 illegal 
aliens crossing the border have prior 
criminal records. 
Mr. Biden recently named KAMALA 
HARRIS as a crisis manager for the bor-
der crisis he created. 
Under her watch, the problem has 
gotten dramatically worse. Over 172,000 
illegal-alien apprehensions have oc-
curred, including 20,000 unaccompanied 
minors taken into custody in March— 
the highest monthly total in the his-
tory of the United States, and it is 
much greater. 
The situation is charitably called a 
disaster. This needs to stop. We need 
order restored to the border and we 
need faithful execution of existing Fed-
eral laws. 
To date, Mr. Biden has not responded 
to my invitation. Therefore, I stand on 
the House floor today to re-invite Mr. 
Biden and Ms. HARRIS to visit Yuma to 
see what my constituents are experi-
encing from this historical surge of il-
legal-alien border crossings.

RECOGNIZING BLACK MATERNAL 
HEALTH WEEK 
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the fourth annual 
Black Maternal Health Week. 
As the founder and co-chair of the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus, I want 
to take this time to speak briefly 
about the Black maternal health crisis 
in America, where Black mamas are 
disproportionately 
and 
needlessly 
dying. 
Across the country, Black women 
from all walks of life are dying from 
preventable 
pregnancy-related 
com-
plications at three and four times the 
rate of non-Hispanic, White women. 
However, 60 percent of Black maternal 
deaths are preventable. 
Research suggests that the cumu-
lative stress of racism and sexism un-
dermines Black women’s health, mak-
ing them more vulnerable to complica-
tions that endanger their lives and the 
lives of their infants. Unfortunately, 
current healthcare practices are inad-
equate in addressing the health con-
sequences of living with stress. 
The Black Maternal Omnibus Act of 
2021, a package of 12 bills, will com-
prehensively address every dimension 
of the maternal health crisis in Amer-
ica to save lives and end racial and eth-
nic disparities in maternal health out-
comes. 
This crisis demands urgent attention 
and serious action to save the lives of 
Black mothers, women of color, and 
other marginalized women across the 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
and this Congress to stand together 
with me to ensure that our mothers 
and babies have the resources they 
need not only to survive but to thrive. 
Black mamas can’t wait, and neither 
will we. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ZIGGY WILINSKI 
(Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Ziggy Wilinski, who recently lost his 
battle with pancreatic cancer. 
A Vietnam War veteran and USPS 
postmaster and general manager, Ziggy 
loved our country and community 
more than anything. Ziggy was an icon 
in the town of Riverhead, which boasts 
a large Polish-American population. 
You could often find Ziggy planning 
and organizing events at the Riverhead 
Polish Hall, which was used to gather 
the community for parties, perform-
ances, and other gatherings. He was 
also instrumental in planning and or-
ganizing the iconic annual Riverhead 
Polish Town Festival. Speaking from 
experience, it is a fantastic event that 
draws thousands of people every year. 
Thank you to Ziggy, his wife, Wanda, 
and his entire family for their service 
to our community. Ziggy was a great 
guy. He will be greatly missed, but I 
have no doubt his legacy will live on 
for generations to come. 
f 
SUPPORTING PEOPLE AFFECTED 
BY LA SOUFRIERE VOLCANO 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, on 
April 9, La Soufriere volcano on the 
Caribbean Island of St. Vincent began a 
series of explosive eruptions. The vol-
cano has erupted several times since 
that date. 
The eruptions have blanketed the is-
land nation with clouds of volcanic ash 
and hot gas and are so large that they 
have reached the neighboring island of 
Barbados, 110 miles away. The eruption 
has resulted in the evacuation of tens 
of thousands of people. 
Electric outages, destroyed crops and 
forests, 
wildlife 
killed, 
and 
water 
shortages are some of the immediate 
issues. The 16,000 evacuated residents 
present dire health issues as people are 
moved to congregant areas in a com-
munity that has had very little vac-
cination to date. 
This natural disaster, along with 
other struggles brought on by COVID, 
will cause St. Vincent and the Grena-
dines to struggle for the next few 
years. It presents an opportunity for 
American action with humanitarian 
disaster relief, support for COVID vac-
cinations, and future technical assist-
ance. 
I am asking this body to use its influ-
ence and legislative actions to support 
St. Vincent, to keep out China and its 
influence, along with Venezuela, in 
support of our brothers and sisters.

CONGRATULATING 
COLLEGE 
OF 
CHARLESTON 
CHEERLEADING 
TEAM 
(Ms. MACE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, today I have 
the privilege to present congratulatory 
remarks to the College of Charleston 
cheerleading team on their historic 
weekend, winning their first national 
championship. 
For the first time in school and pro-
gram history, the College of Charleston 
cheerleaders won first place, under the 
direction 
of 
their 
head 
coach, 
Samantha Pairet, who stands as an ex-
emplary leader of young athletes in 
South Carolina and around the coun-
try. 
The team traveled to Daytona April 7 
through 10 to compete in the Inter-
mediate Small Coed Division I per-
formance division, where they received 
a score of 94.23 and were crowned the 
Intermediate Small Coed Division I na-
tional champions. Way to go, Cougars. 
f 
MAKING EQUAL PAY A REALITY 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. 
This morning, women across America 
drove to jobs where they will be paid 
lower salaries for equal work. Today, 
Black women make 63 cents and His-
panic women make 55 cents for every 
dollar earned by a White man. Over a 
lifetime, that gap grows to $400,000, 
enough to pay off the mortgage and put 
two kids through college. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act will not 
fix the systemic racism and sexism 
that are embedded in our Nation’s 
treatment of women, but it will take 
us a step closer to making equal pay a 
reality. 
I am proud to be voting, once again, 
to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. I 
am calling on all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me and 
pass this long-overdue bill into law.

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise

percent increase from February and 
the highest figure ever recorded. 
This is a dangerous humanitarian, 
health, and security crisis that war-
rants immediate action. 
I am particularly concerned about 
these children, Mr. Speaker. As the 
President of Mexico recently con-
firmed, this administration’s policies 
and speeches on this subject have con-
vinced families that they can send 
their children to the United States in 
search of a better life. 
Yet, we know that the situation is 
often dire for these children. Human 
traffickers made an estimated $14 mil-
lion per day along the border in the 
month of February alone. 
Shortly, I will be joining my col-
leagues to visit the border and speak 
directly to our Border Patrol agents 
firsthand about their experiences. 
I look forward to sharing that insight 
with my constituents. However, we al-
ready know that there is unprece-
dented disorder at the border, and im-
mediate action is needed. We must se-
cure our border immediately. 
f 
TAKING ACTION TO CLOSE PAY 
GAP 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
On average, women are paid just 82 
cents for every dollar paid to men. The 
gap is even larger, almost double, for 
women of color. Compounded over a 
lifetime, the pay gap becomes a wealth 
tax, costing women thousands and 
thousands of dollars in lost wages. 
Longstanding workplace discrimina-
tion sets women back in pay, benefits, 
hiring, and promotions. Closing the 
pay gap will provide more financial 
stability for women, especially those 
who are hardest hit by the pandemic. 
At a recent Oversight and Reform 
Committee hearing on Equal Pay Day, 
soccer superstar Megan Rapinoe testi-
fied: ‘‘One cannot simply outperform 
inequality.’’ 
Combating pay discrimination re-
quires deliberate action, and that is 
what the Paycheck Fairness bill does. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this important 
bill.

REMEMBERING U.S. CAPITOL 
POLICE OFFICER WILLIAM EVANS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of U.S. Capitol Police 
Officer William Evans. 
This week, we pay our respects to Of-
ficer Evans’ life of service as he was re-
membered with a congressional tribute 
and lying in honor in the United States 
Capitol rotunda. 
Officer Evans was a beloved father, 
husband, brother, son, and friend. 
He was a dedicated officer, joining 
the U.S. Capitol Police on March 7, 
2003, and servicing for 18 years. In addi-
tion to patrolling the north barricade, 
Officer Evans was a member of the Cap-
itol Division’s First Responder’s Unit. 
Officer Evans was a member of our 
Capitol family, and I want to send my 
heartfelt condolences to the Evans 
family for their loss. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s take this time to 
remember Officer Evans and to thank 
each and every member of U.S. Capitol 
Police and National Guard members 
here on the Capitol Grounds for their 
continued service to keep us safe.

SUPPORTING WOMEN WITH EQUAL 
PAY 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in support of all women across the 
Nation, to ensure they will be paid fair-
ly based on their work performance, 
not their gender. 
Mr. Speaker, I am blessed with three 
young daughters. My oldest daughter, 
‘Ale’aokalani, who, as we speak, is 
studying at Juan Diego High School in 
Draper, Utah, is preparing to embark 
on her own journey as a grown woman. 
She is smart, talented, and, most of all, 
a hard worker. 
But right now, in our country, she 
and my two younger daughters are 
faced with insurmountable odds that 
no amount of hard work or diligence 
can overcome. As Native Hawaiian 
women, they are estimated to only 
make 63 cents to every dollar that 
their White male peers would make 
working the exact same job. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act guaran-
tees they will no longer have to fight 
for the same rights and paychecks as 
men. 
Mr. Speaker, equal pay for equal 
work, it is as simple as that. 
f 
RECOGNIZING HEROIC ACTIONS OF 
U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the heroic ac-
tions of the U.S. Marshals Service. 
Last month, the U.S. Marshals Serv-
ice issued this press release: In an on-
going joint operation known as Oper-
ation Homecoming, the U.S. Marshals, 
in coordination with the National Cen-
ter for Missing and Exploited Children 
and other Iowa agencies, have located 
21 missing Iowa children between the 
ages of 4 and 17 since October 2020. 
As a mother, I cannot begin to imag-
ine the heartache the families of these 
children have endured, but thanks to 
the U.S. Marshals Service and other 
agencies tasked with finding missing 
and exploited children, these 21 chil-
dren have finally been brought home. 
I would like to thank Deputy Mar-
shal Christopher Siemens, U.S. Mar-
shal Doug Strike, and the more than 50 
local task forces that are working to 
return Iowa children home to their 
families. 
Speaking of missing and exploited 
children, it cannot go without saying 
that, for missing and exploited chil-
dren, know what is happening at our 
border is a travesty. I want to thank 
Customs and Border Protection agents 
for all they are doing to try to reunite 
these children and get them safely to 
their end result. But it should not con-
tinue as the U.S. Federal Government, 
under this administration, is engaged 
in a human smuggling operation.

THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERATION—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–29) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CORREA) laid before the House the fol-
lowing message from the President of 
the United States; which was read and, 
together with the accompanying pa-
pers, referred to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report 
that I have issued an Executive Order 
declaring a national emergency with 
respect to the unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States posed by specified harm-
ful foreign activities of the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation. 
I have determined that specified 
harmful foreign activities of the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation—in 
particular, efforts to undermine the 
conduct of free and fair democratic 
elections and democratic institutions 
in the United States and its allies and 
partners; to engage in and facilitate 
malicious 
cyber-enabled 
activities 
against the United States and its allies 
and 
partners; 
to 
foster 
and 
use 
transnational corruption to influence 
foreign 
governments; 
to 
pursue 
extraterritorial 
activities 
targeting 
dissidents or journalists; to undermine 
security in countries and regions im-
portant to United States national secu-
rity; and to violate well-established 
principles of international law, includ-
ing respect for the territorial integrity 
of states—constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy 
of the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

diate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

ant to House Resolution 303, the

stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor printed

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous materials on H.R. 7, 
the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
When President Kennedy signed the 
Equal Pay Act in 1963, our country 
codified the basic idea that all workers 
should earn equal pay for equal work, 
regardless of sex. Regrettably, more 
than five decades later and after the 
passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act, that promise remains unfulfilled. 
Today, women continue to be paid, 
on average, 82 cents on the dollar com-
pared to men. This wage disparity is 
far worse for women of color, who 
make less than White men and White 
women. It exists across every sector, 
regardless of education, experience, oc-
cupation, industry or job title. A re-
cent Census Bureau study found that 38 
to 70 percent of the gender wage gap is 
unexplained and likely due to discrimi-
nation. 
Drawn out over a lifetime, the per-
sistent wage gap could cost a woman 
anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million. 
This impacts both workers and their 
families, often meaning the difference 
between financial stability and per-
petual hardship. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act offers an 
opportunity to finally secure equal pay 
for equal work. The bill strengthens 
the Equal Pay Act by bolstering work-
ers’ rights to discuss their wages with 
coworkers and making it easier for 
workers to join class action lawsuits; 
enhancing the enforcement tools avail-
able to the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission and the Labor De-
partment; and, more importantly, by

closing loopholes for employer defenses 
and requiring employers to prove pay 
disparities exist for legitimate, job-re-
lated reasons. 
The Biden administration has issued 
a Statement of Administration Policy 
in support of this bill. It states: ‘‘En-
suring equal pay is essential to advanc-
ing American values of fairness and eq-
uity.’’ 
Then it adds: ‘‘The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act is commonsense legislation 
that would strengthen the Equal Pay 
Act and give workers more tools to 
fight sex-based pay discrimination.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Statement of Administration Pol-
icy of H.R. 7. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 7—PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT—REP. 
DELAURO, D–CT, AND 225 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. Ensuring equal pay is essential to 
advancing American values of fairness and 
equity. Women lose thousands of dollars 
each year, and hundreds of thousands over a 
lifetime, because of the gender and racial 
wage gap. Women working full-time, year- 
round in 2019 earned 82 cents for every dollar 
earned by men working full-time; year- 
round, and these disparities are greater for 
women of color. Pay inequity also impacts 
individuals who face intersecting forms of 
discrimination based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity, including LGBTQ+ indi-
viduals. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, millions of 
women have dropped out of the labor force, 
partly reflecting the increased domestic 
labor demands on women. Caregiving de-
mands 
often 
fall 
disproportionately 
on 
women, which leads to many women having 
to reduce their hours, resulting in lower 
earnings. As more and more American fami-
lies rely on women’s income, the pay gap 
hurts not only women, but also the families 
who depend on them. The cumulative impact 
of wage gaps adds up to financial insecurity 
over the course of a career for women and 
their families and for generations who fol-
low. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is common-
sense legislation that would strengthen the 
Equal Pay Act and give workers more tools 
to fight sex-based pay discrimination. It 
would also take major steps toward increas-
ing pay transparency, an essential provision 
to advance equality in the workplace, by ex-
plicitly protecting workers from retaliation 
for simply discussing their compensation 
with their colleagues. The bill would also ex-
pand opportunities for workers to receive 
training on effective negotiation skills. The 
bill would also limit an employer’s ability to 
rely on salary history during the hiring proc-
ess to set pay, or when determining wages 
for a promotion. H.R. 7 would hold employers 
accountable by closing judicially created 
loopholes for employer defenses and by add-
ing a class action option under the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. The bill would re-
quire the collection of pay data to enable 
better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay 
discrimination. 
The Administration looks forward to con-
tinuing to work with the Congress to address 
pay equity and urges quick action on this 
landmark bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing for this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 7, the Democrats’ conven-
iently titled, but painfully misguided, 
Paycheck Fairness Act, which should 
be called the paychecks for trial law-
yers act. 
We all agree on the fundamental 
principle of this bill: women should not 
be paid less than men for the same 
work. 
That is not up for debate; and, for 
me, it has never been up for debate; 
and, for our country, it hasn’t been 
since 1963, when the Equal Pay Act 
amended the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, making equal pay the law of the 
land. 
Moreover, in 1964, title VII of the 
Civil 
Rights 
Act 
codified 
non-
discrimination rules for employment, 
making it illegal to discriminate on 
the basis of race, color, national origin, 
religion, and sex. 
The question before us today is 
whether 
the 
Democrats’ 
Paycheck 
Fairness Act provides any additional 
protections to women in the work-
place. The answer is a resounding no. 
The United States has some of the 
most varied and complex workplaces in 
the world. Before the onslaught of 
COVID–19, women were earning mer-
ited paychecks in record numbers. Ac-
cording to a Harvard University anal-
ysis and numerous other studies, the 
difference in earning between men and 
women comes down to choices made re-
garding careers and parenting. Many 
working women take advantage of 
flexible work schedules to meet their 
diverse needs. A survey by Pew found 
70 percent of working mothers say that 
a flexible schedule is extremely impor-
tant. 
Democrats aren’t giving the full 
story when they talk about pay dif-
ferences. Women are making career 
choices that are best for themselves 
and their families. Limiting their free-
dom to do so is wrong. Congress has no 
place in telling women their career 
choices are wrong, yet Democrats are 
hellbent on telling all Americans how 
to live their lives, how to spend their 
money, and now how to make career 
decisions. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is not a 
win for women in the slightest. It is a 
false promise that creates opportuni-
ties and advantages only for trial law-
yers looking for easy payouts while 
causing irreparable harm to employers. 
By making it much easier to bring law-
suits of questionable validity against 
employers, trial lawyers will be able to 
force employers into settlements or try 
for 
unlimited 
paydays 
from 
jury 
awards, lining their own pockets and 
dragging 
women 
through 
tedious, 
never-ending legal proceedings. 
In the United States, we believe in 
innocence until proven guilty, but this 
bill assumes otherwise. Under current 
law, business owners can defend them-
selves from a claim of pay discrimina-
tion by proving that a pay differential 
is based on legitimate, business-related 
factors other than sex. 
H.R. 7 would radically alter this law, 
requiring a business owner to convince 
a judge or jury that the pay differen-
tial was required by ‘‘business neces-
sity.’’ This is a nearly impossible bur-
den of proof to meet that will lead to 
unfair judgments against business own-
ers because the plain meaning of the 
term ‘‘business necessity’’ is that the 
pay differential must be absolutely es-
sential to the business. 
H.R. 7 would also result in a flood of 
litigation in front of judges and juries, 
who will delve into employer com-
pensation decisions even when the em-
ployer can demonstrate that those de-
cisions are based on legitimate, busi-
ness-related reasons having nothing to 
do with the sex of the employee. 
Fearing Big Government and liabil-
ity risks that could leave them bank-
rupt, many business owners will likely 
implement rigid pay bands—a model 
used by government and unionized 
businesses. This means workers will 
not be compensated on the basis of 
merit. 
This is the opposite of the American 
Dream. 
As 
one 
columnist 
wrote: 
‘‘equality 
of 
opportunity—not 
out-
comes—is the American ideal.’’ 
On top of the legal jeopardy this bill 
creates for employers, H.R. 7 also man-
dates that business owners submit 
mountains of worker pay data to the 
Federal Government. This will pose 
significant threats to the confiden-
tiality and privacy of workers’ pay 
data, create a data stash that would be 
impossible to protect or interpret, and 
cost business owners more than $600 
million annually. 
This bill purports to champion equal-
ity for women, yet it disregards the 40 
percent of small businesses owned by 
women that will be forced to imple-
ment pay policies found in govern-
ment-run workplaces and be stuck pay-
ing through the nose in compliance 
costs if this bill passes. 
Even worse, H.R. 7 will severely limit 
workplace flexibility for women. Many 
working women take advantage of 
flexible work schedules to meet their 
diverse needs, yet this harmful legisla-
tion completely ignores this reality 
and threatens to take away the choices 
and freedom necessary for them to re-
tain employment. 
We know employees prefer workable 
and flexible schedules, and now is not 
the time to limit these options for 
women who have been hit particularly 
hard by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Should my Democrat colleagues wish 
to discuss additional policies which 
will foster the advancement of women 
in the workplace, we can consider leg-
islation that safely reopens our schools 
and businesses, provides the flexibility 
and support to expand work-based 
learning programs and create viable 
pathways that enable more individuals 
to reskill and build fulfilling careers on 
their own terms, and promotes career 
and technical education, to name a 
few. 
Unfortunately, my Democrat col-
leagues would rather impose radical

and unworkable policy under the guise 
of progress than find bipartisan solu-
tions which foster environments where 
individuals are empowered to succeed 
and make the decisions that are best 
for them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 7, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), who 
is the Assistant Speaker of the House. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, 
in 
December, 
American 
women lost 156,000 jobs, accounting for 
100 percent of jobs lost; and since the 
start of this pandemic, nearly 3 million 
women have been pushed out of the 
workforce. 
Women have borne the brunt of the 
economic crisis brought on by this pan-
demic, and gender pay inequality is at 
the root of the problem. More than five 
decades after the passage of the Equal 
Pay Act, women still only make 82 
cents for every dollar earned by men, 
and that gap is even wider for women 
of color. 
By passing the Paycheck Fairness 
Act today, we are correcting this injus-
tice and ensuring that all people re-
ceive equal pay for equal work. 
Let’s be clear: this isn’t a women’s 
issue. Pay inequity hurts children, 
families, and our entire economy. It is 
fundamental to our recovery and our 
ability to not just rebuild to status 
quo, but to rebuild a just and inclusive 
America for all. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member FOXX for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, everyone supports equal 
pay for equal performance, and every-
one is against gender-based wage dis-
crimination. This has been the law for 
nearly 60 years. 
When I entered the workforce 30 
years ago after college, wage discrimi-
nation 
was 
basically 
nonexistent, 
thanks to the law and a simple recogni-
tion of the value of a diverse work-
force. Companies then, as now, simply 
assigned a starting salary based upon 
the position, and paid that wage to ev-
eryone they hired; thereafter providing 
merit increases based upon perform-
ance, unlike what happens in union 
shops and with government positions. 
But do my Democrat friends across 
the aisle base their staff salaries on 
gender? Or do they pay women less 
than men? Or do they set salaries based 
on market conditions, qualifications, 
and experience? 
b 1245 
Why do they assume less of private 
employers? 
We already have laws and protections 
that ensure fair pay, and companies 
must maintain documentation dem-
onstrating nondiscrimination in wages, 
performance evaluations, and merit in-
creases. 
In fact, we are in a much stronger po-
sition today than we were 30, let alone 
60 years ago. 
This legislation from the Democrat 
Party is just another attempt to insert 
themselves further into the workplace 
with a purported cure for a disease that 
doesn’t exist. Democrats are dependent 
upon the perception of discrimination 
and victimhood to expand their base of 
power as they continue to divide us as 
a Nation. 
Democrats also view employers, busi-
nesses, and job creators with disdain, 
believing that, left to their own de-
vices, they would seek to harm and ex-
ploit their employees. Not to worry, 
Big Government to the rescue; or, more 
accurately, big Democrat government 
laying on more control, more regula-
tions, more mandates, all designed to 
enrich their trial lawyer friends and in-
crease liability for employers. 
The Democrats will disingenuously 
cite statistics that indicate that there 
are discrepancies in income based on 
gender, but they won’t specify discrep-
ancies in pay for the same positions in 
the same industries because they don’t 
exist. 
This bill adds more layers of burden-
some and costly reporting require-
ments for businesses, estimated to cost 
about $600 million a year, costs which 
will be passed on to consumers in high-
er prices with no real benefit. 
The bill doesn’t do anything to help 
women in the workplace, but it hurts 
employers, exposing them to greater li-
ability, and enriches the trial lawyer 
donors to the Democrat Party. It al-
lows the lawyers to litigate every deci-
sion an employer makes, and to bank-
rupt small businesses by seeking un-
limited monetary damages. 
It makes it impossible for employers 
to defend charges of gender-based dis-
crimination when experience, quali-
fications, 
or 
performance 
warrants 
higher pay. They would now need to 
prove that the determination is a busi-
ness necessity. 
Leave it to politicians in Washington 
to think that they have the right to de-
termine for employers what is a busi-
ness necessity. 
Left to themselves, businesses and 
employers tend to get it right. But Big 
Government almost never gets it right, 
and this bill is no exception. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the 
sponsor of the bill, a champion for 
equal pay, and the chair of the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, legislation that I have intro-
duced in every Congress since 1997. 
Since then, we have pushed and bat-
tled to strengthen the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963. We launched, side by side, into 
the fray to elevate pay discrimination, 
to emphasize how central its impact is 
to working families. 
I cannot tell you how difficult it has 
been to break through on something so 
simple; so simple. Men and women in 
the same job deserve the same pay. It 
is a principle that we adhere to in this 
Congress, and I don’t believe anyone 
would challenge it. The same is true of 
the U.S. military. 
Last month, we recognized Equal Pay 
Day on March 24, which is the day into 
the current year that women must 
work to meet the wages earned by men 
in the previous year. 
The National Committee on Pay Eq-
uity tells us, at its lowest point in 1973, 
full-time, working women earned a me-
dian of 56.6 cents to every dollar that 
full-time working men earned. Today, 
women who work full-time, year-round 
are paid, on average, only 82 cents for 
every dollar paid to men. 
The gap exists in every State, regard-
less of geography, occupation, edu-
cation, or work patterns. And it is 
worse for women of color. Latinas are 
typically paid 55 cents; Native Amer-
ican women 60 cents; Black women 63 
cents; Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander women are paid as little as 52 
cents. 
This wage disparity costs the average 
American woman and her family an es-
timated $400,000 to $2 million, impact-
ing Social Security benefits and pen-
sions. 
Today, the issue and the environ-
ment have collided. This pandemic has 
brought out the depth of our problem, 
exposed 
existing 
inequalities, 
and 
threatened women’s economic security 
at a disproportionate rate. Women 
have lost more than five million jobs; 
and as we seek to rebuild our economy, 
let us remember that the pay gap hurts 
not only women, but also the families 
who depend on them. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is a bi-
partisan piece of legislation, which has 
the support of every member of the 
Democratic Caucus, as well as three 
Republicans. It would toughen the rem-
edies in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to 
give America’s working women the op-
portunity to fight wage discrimination 
and receive the paycheck they have 
rightfully earned. 
It would require employers to prove 
that pay disparities exist for legiti-
mate, job-related reasons; ban retalia-
tion against workers who discuss their 
wages; it facilitates a wronged work-
er’s participation in a class action suit; 
and it prohibits employers from seek-
ing the salary history of prospective 
employees. 
And by now, we are all familiar with 
the case of Lilly Ledbetter. Her bosses 
said: ‘‘Their plant did not need women; 
that women did not help, and, in fact, 
they caused problems.’’ 
Well, a jury found that, yes, Lilly 
Ledbetter 
had 
been 
discriminated 
against, and awarded her $3.8 million in 
back pay and damages, which the Su-
preme Court eliminated. She received 
nothing, as it closed the courtroom 
door to all women. 
We, the Congress, reopened that door 
with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. 
It reversed the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion. It was a court access case, but it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1804 
April 15, 2021 
did not address the underlying issue of 
pay discrimination. 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 
1956, in his State of the Union address, 
said: ‘‘Legislation to apply the prin-
ciple of equal pay for equal work with-
out discrimination because of sex is a 
matter of simple justice. I earnestly 
urge the Congress to move swiftly to 
implement these needed labor meas-
ures.’’ 
When President Kennedy signed the 
Equal Pay Act into law nearly 58 years 
ago, he said: ‘‘It is a first step. It af-
firms our determination that when 
women enter the labor force, they will 
find equality in their pay envelopes.’’ 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is the 
next step. It simply brings the Equal 
Pay Act into line with the remedies al-
ready available for those who are sub-
ject to other forms of employment dis-
crimination. That is it, pure and sim-
ple. 
We have passed paycheck fairness 
through this House in 2008, 2009, 2019. 
But, now, in the 117th Congress in 
which we welcomed the most women in 
our history, we must get it into law. 
We have the opportunity to make good 
on that promise that Presidents of 
both parties have made. We need to 
seize that moment. 
It is time for us to say that the work 
that women do in our society today is 
valued and respected, and the contribu-
tion that we make, if it is good enough 
for the women in the House of Rep-
resentatives, then it is good enough for 
women all over the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter supporting the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act by a broad coalition of organi-
zations that promote economic oppor-
tunity for women. 
FEBRUARY 3, 2021. 
CO-SPONSOR AND SUPPORT SWIFT PASSAGE OF 
THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: As members of 
a broad coalition of organizations that pro-
mote economic opportunity for women and 
vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination 
laws, we strongly urge you to co-sponsor and 
push for swift passage of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act as a top priority of the 117th Con-
gress. Despite federal and state equal pay 
laws, gender pay gaps persist, and earnings 
lost to these gaps are exacerbating the finan-
cial effects of COVID–19, falling particularly 
heavily on women of color and the families 
who depend on their income. This legislation 
offers a much needed update to the Equal 
Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to 
battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge 
discrimination. 
The COVID–19 pandemic and systemic rac-
ism have exposed how the work performed 
primarily by women, and particularly Black 
and brown women, has long been and con-
tinues to be undervalued and underpaid, even 
as the rest of the country is newly recog-
nizing the essential nature of this work. 
Black women, Latinas, and other women of 
color are especially likely to be on the front 
lines of the crisis, risking their lives in jobs 
in health care, child care, and grocery stores; 
they are also being paid less than their male 
counterparts. At the same time, women in 
this country lost more than 5 million jobs in 
2020; indeed, women accounted for 100% of 
the jobs lost in December 2020. The unem-
ployment rate for Black women and Latinas 
remains exceptionally high. These high job-
less numbers threaten to exacerbate gender 
wage gaps when women regain employment. 
We cannot build back an economy that 
works for everyone without ensuring that all 
women can work with equality, safety, and 
dignity, starting with pay equity. 
There is no more fitting way to begin this 
session than by making real, concrete 
progress in ensuring all women receive fair 
pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and 
strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to en-
sure that it provides robust protection 
against sex-based pay discrimination. Among 
other provisions, this comprehensive bill 
bars retaliation against workers who volun-
tarily discuss or disclose their wages. It 
closes loopholes that have allowed employers 
to pay women less than men for the same 
work without any important business jus-
tification related to the job. It ensures 
women can receive the same robust remedies 
for sex-based pay discrimination that are 
currently available to those subjected to dis-
crimination based on race and ethnicity. It 
prohibits employers from relying on salary 
history in determining future pay, so that 
pay discrimination does not follow women 
from job to job. And it also provides much 
needed training and technical assistance, as 
well as data collection and research. 
Women are increasingly the primary or co- 
breadwinner in their families and cannot af-
ford to be shortchanged any longer. Women 
working full-time, year-round are typically 
paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to 
men. But for every dollar paid to their white, 
non-Hispanic 
male 
counterparts, 
Black 
women only make 63 cents, Native women 
only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55 cents. 
While Asian American and Pacific Islander 
(AAPI) women make 87 cents for every dollar 
paid to white, non-Hispanic men, women in 
many AAPI communities experience dras-
tically wider pay gaps. Furthermore, moms 
are paid less than dads. And even when con-
trolling for factors, such as education and 
experience, the pay gaps persist and start 
early in women’s careers and contribute to a 
wealth gap that follows them throughout 
their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be ad-
dressed only if workers have the legal tools 
necessary to challenge discrimination and 
employers are provided with effective incen-
tives and technical assistance to comply 
with the law. 
We recently commemorated the twelfth 
anniversary of the enactment of the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That vital law rec-
tified the Supreme Court’s harmful decision 
in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber 
Company. The law helps to ensure that indi-
viduals subjected to unlawful compensation 
discrimination are able to have their day in 
court and effectively assert their rights 
under federal antidiscrimination laws. But 
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, critical as 
it is, is only one step on the path to ensuring 
women receive equal pay for equal work. It’s 
time to take the next step toward achieving 
equal pay. We urge you to prioritize the Pay-
check Fairness Act in the 117th Congress by 
co-sponsoring and urging swift passage of 
this legislation, taking up the cause of Lilly 
Ledbetter and all those who have fought for 
equal pay. 
If you have any questions, please do not 
hesitate to contact Kate Nielson, Director of 
Public Policy & Legal Advocacy at the 
American Association of University Women 
or Emily Martin, Vice President for Edu-
cation & Workplace Justice at the National 
Women’s Law Center.

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition of H.R. 7, the Pay-
check Fairness Act. 
We don’t need the government telling 
business how much they can pay their 
employees. Let’s not forget that it is 
business that has lifted us out of pov-
erty, not the government. 
As a former businesswoman who has 
actually signed the front of paychecks, 
not just the backs, what you do as an 
employee and what you produce as an 
employee 
matters, 
and 
what 
you 
produce should be reflected in your 
outcome, not your gender. 
Do not—please, do not insult me as a 
woman by lowering the bar for me. And 
please, do not insult me as a business 
owner for forcing me to lower the bar 
for my employees. Outcomes and hard 
work are what leads to success, not 
your gender. 
Gender 
discrimination 
is 
already 
against the law thanks to the Equal 
Pay Act. 
At a time when businesses are shut-
ting their doors due to the pandemic, 
we 
should 
be 
creating 
jobs 
and 
incentivizing people to work. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), 
chair of the Subcommittee on Work-
force Protections. 
Ms. ADAMS. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding, and for his support, and 
for his leadership on the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as I have 
done for my entire career, from the 
North Carolina House to the U.S. 
House, in support of equal pay for 
equal work. 
It is 2021, and women are still subject 
to unequal, unfair compensation in the 
workplace. This truth, this wage gap is 
at its worst for women of color. Black 
women, for example, earn an average of 
63 cents on the dollar compared to 
men. 
This issue persists in nearly every 
line of work, regardless of education, 
experience, occupation, industry, or job 
title. And if you don’t believe that 
data, take it from me. I have lived it. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is an op-
portunity for Congress to strengthen 
the Equal Pay Act, to bolster the 
rights of working women, and to put an 
end to the gender-based wage disparity 
once and for all. 
We cannot continue to rob nearly 
half of our Nation’s workforce of the 
wages they deserve, nor can we con-
tinue to force women to work far more 
just to be paid fairly. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the National Partnership 
for Women and Families in support of 
H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR 
WOMEN & FAMILIES, 
April 13, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: The National 
Partnership for Women & Families is a non- 
profit, non-partisan advocacy organization 
committed to improving the lives of women 
and families by achieving equity for all 
women. Since our creation as the Women’s 
Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have fought 
for every significant federal advance for 
equal opportunity in the workplace, includ-
ing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. 
We write in strong support of H.R. 7, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, and urge you to vote 
for passage while opposing any harmful 
amendments. This critical bill will help our 
nation build back an economy that works for 
everyone by ensuring that all women can 
work with equality and dignity. 
As the Paycheck Fairness Act recognizes, 
women and workers from communities of 
color continue to face significant pay dis-
parities in the United States. On average, 
women working full time and year-round are 
paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to 
men, and the wage gap is widest for women 
of color. Among women who hold full-time, 
year-round jobs in the United States, Black 
women are typically paid 63 cents, Native 
American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 
cents for every dollar paid to white, non-His-
panic men. White, non-Hispanic women are 
paid 79 cents. Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander (AAPI) women who work full time, 
year-round are paid as little as 52 cents for 
every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic 
men, as Burmese women are. Asian Amer-
ican women overall are paid just 87 cents for 
every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic 
men. The wage gap persists across different 
industries, occupations and education levels 
and exists in nearly every congressional dis-
trict. 
These troubling statistics underscore the 
need to update our nation’s equal pay laws. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would make it 
safe for workers to discuss their wages with 
each other. Employers can currently mask 
compensation discrimination with pay se-
crecy policies that forbid employees from 
discussing pay and benefits. Secrecy and the 
threat of retaliation leave workers unable to 
learn about and challenge pay disparities. In 
a survey of private-sector workers, over 62 
percent of women and 60 percent of men re-
ported that their employers discourage or 
prohibit discussing wage and salary informa-
tion. The Paycheck Fairness Act would 
make pay secrecy policies illegal. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would also pro-
hibit employers from screening job appli-
cants based on their salary history or requir-
ing salary history during the interview proc-
ess. Women are typically paid lower wages 
than men even in their first jobs. Salary dis-
parities that begin early in a woman’s career 
can follow her from job to job when employ-
ers are permitted to base a new hire’s salary 
on her prior earnings. People should be paid 
fairly for the job they are being hired to do. 
The bill would also make it more difficult 
for employers to justify pay discrimination. 
Workers in the same company who do the 
same job and have the same amount of expe-
rience, education and training should be paid 
the same. Currently, however, employers are 
able to explain away differences in pay too 
easily by relying on a catch-all defense in 
the Equal Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness 
Act would close that loophole and require 
employers to prove that any differences in 
pay are not sex-based, are job-related con-
cerning the position in question, and are 
consistent with business necessity and ac-
count for the entire difference in compensa-
tion. Employees claiming pay discrimination 
would also have new opportunities to prove 
that the employer’s defense is the pretext. 
In addition to these critical provisions, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act would also allow 
workers alleging pay discrimination within 
the same company to file class-action suits; 
would change the remedies of the Equal Pay 
Act to treat gender-based pay discrimination 
claims the same as other civil rights viola-
tions that result in unfair pay; would recog-
nize companies that want to do better; and 
would improve fair pay enforcement, data 
collection and disclosure. 
Closing the gender and racial wage gap is a 
crucial measure to take in response to 
COVID–19. Throughout the pandemic, women 
and people of color have disproportionately 
experienced the adverse effects of the public 
health and economic crisis. Women and peo-
ple of color have been on the front lines 
working in our most essential occupations, 
but forces like wage inequality have kept 
them underpaid and undervalued. The Pay-
check Fairness Act would ensure that work-
ers are given the support needed to ensure 
pay equity during this time of crisis. 
Updating our nation’s equal pay laws is 
also crucial to reducing negative impacts re-
sulting from the mass exodus of women from 
the labor force during the pandemic. Wom-
en’s labor force participation is at a 33-year 
record low, with nearly a million moms hav-
ing left the workforce, largely due to the dif-
ficulties of balancing full-time work and 
care responsibilities. Increases in women’s 
labor force participation rates drove the sig-
nificant narrowing of the gender wage gap 
during the 1970s and 1980s, a narrowing which 
stagnated in the late 1990s, around the time 
women’s labor force participation peaked. 
Without 
the 
Paycheck 
Fairness 
Act, 
progress on closing the gender wage gap 
could be set back decades, especially since 
women face financial penalties for taking 
time out of the workforce, with one study 
finding that women who took just one year 
out of the workforce had annual earnings 39 
percent lower than women who did not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1806 
April 15, 2021 
The 
Paycheck 
Fairness 
Act 
would 
strengthen existing federal protections, en-
sure more equitable workplaces and allow 
women to remain in the workforce and main-
tain their economic stability at all phases of 
life. At the current rate of progress, projec-
tions are that the gender wage gap will close 
in 2041 for Asian women, 2069 for white 
women, 2369 for Black women, and 2451 for 
Latina women. Women cannot—and should 
not—wait that long for pay equity. It is time 
to clarify and strengthen existing federal 
protections for women in the workforce by 
passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. We urge 
you to vote in support and opposed harmful 
amendments. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 7. 
This bill is a solution in search of a 
problem, and it does nothing to help 
employees. In reality, the bill would 
only boost paychecks for trial lawyers 
and not workers. 
H.R. 7 places unworkable, burden-
some restrictions on employers, and 
also poses a threat to worker privacy. 
Even more, this bill would kill the 
Christmas bonus by effectively prohib-
iting employers from paying end-of- 
the-year bonuses to their employees. 
This hardly seems fair to an employee, 
despite the title of the bill. 
Republicans tried to strengthen the 
bill during the committee markup. My 
colleague, Ms. STEFANIK, offered an 
amendment that would have made 
commonsense improvements to the 
text, but that amendment was rejected 
by the Democrats. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. We 
should not allow trial lawyers and bur-
densome restrictions to kill the Christ-
mas bonus under the false guise of fair-
ness. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill will prohibit paying all the 
men a bonus and none of the women a 
bonus, although they have produced 
equally for the business. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. 
I want to commend Chairwoman 
ROSA DELAURO for her extraordinary 
efforts and commend Chairman SCOTT 
for bringing this timely policy to fru-
ition. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. I 
think most of us can agree that every 
American should earn equal pay for 
equal work. 
This legislation takes meaningful 
steps 
toward 
ensuring 
that 
every 
American, regardless of gender, re-
ceives fair compensation for their 
work. 
We have seen over the course of the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
that 
essential 
workers are the lifeblood of our soci-
ety. We have seen women on the 
frontlines in the hospital, in the class-
room, and at our essential retail 
stores, and it is time that all of these 
‘‘sheroes’’ are compensated at the same 
rate as their male counterparts. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the International Broth-
erhood of Teamsters urging passage of 
this legislation and highlighting the 
persistent wage gaps between genders. 
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 
OF TEAMSTERS, 
Washington, DC, April 13, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
more than 1.4 million members of the Inter-
national Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge 
you to support fundamental fairness by com-
bating wage discrimination on the basis of 
sex by passing H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness 
Act. I urge you to vote yes on H.R. 7 and to 
pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without any 
weakening amendments. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would address 
the persistent wage gap based on sex by 
eliminating loopholes that hinder the effec-
tiveness of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. H.R. 7 
would update and strengthen the Equal Pay 
Act in important ways. The bill closes loop-
holes that have allowed employers to pay 
women less than men for the same work 
without any important business purpose re-
lated to the job. It would require employers 
to demonstrate that wage gaps are truly the 
result of factors other than gender. Impor-
tantly, it would prohibit retaliation against 
workers who share salary information or in-
quire about their employer’s wage practices. 
H.R. 7 would also bring the remedies and pro-
cedures of the Equal Pay Act into conform-
ance with those available for other civil 
rights claims. The Paycheck Fairness Act 
holds employers accountable for pay discrep-
ancies between their male and female em-
ployees while strengthening incentives to 
prevent pay discrimination. And, it would 
preclude pay discrimination from following 
women from job to job. 
While some progress has been made since 
the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act of 2009, the wage gap still persists, and 
disparities are evident at every educational 
level. Nationally, women still earn only 82 
cents for every dollar earned by their male 
colleagues. For women of color, the wage 
gaps are even larger. 
Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act will 
provide women and all other workers the 
tools necessary to challenge discrimination 
against them. It is an important step in 
making real progress in the fight to elimi-
nate the gender wage gap and to provide eco-
nomic, and retirement, security to women 
and their families. 
It is well past the time to end pay dis-
crimination in the workplace. The Team-
sters Union urges you to reject weakening 
amendments and to vote yes on final passage 
of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. HOFFA, 
General President. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
der gap is clear, and the Paycheck 
Fairness Act will address this dis-
parity. Not only will this legislation 
help women in Georgia, but it will help 
families across the Nation. 
b 1300 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, proponents of H.R. 7 
claim that despite current prohibitions 
against 
pay 
discrimination, 
female 
workers are still paid, on average, con-
siderably less than male workers and, 
as a result, a pernicious wage gap ex-
ists. 
However, 
many 
studies 
dem-
onstrate that the gap is not necessarily 
the product of workplace discrimina-
tion. 
In fact, this gap nearly disappears 
when factors such as hours worked per 
week, rate of leaving the workforce, 
and industry and occupation are con-
sidered. 
A 2020 study by compensation soft-
ware company PayScale found that 
when controlling for job title, years of 
experience, 
industry, 
location, 
and 
other 
compensable 
factors, 
women 
earned 98 percent as much as men. 
A 2009 study commissioned by the 
U.S. Department of Labor found a gen-
der wage gap of between 4.8 and 7.1 per-
cent when controlling for economic 
variables between men and women. 
A 2018 Harvard study found that the 
gap in pay between female and male 
bus and train operators working for the 
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Au-
thority, MBTA, can be explained by the 
workplace choices that women and 
men make rather than other factors, 
such as discrimination. The study 
found that the earnings gap for MBTA 
bus and train operators is explained by 
the fact that the male operators took 
48 percent fewer unpaid hours off and 
worked 83 percent more overtime hours 
per year than the female operators. 
I want to point out that I am giving 
you facts here, Mr. Speaker, facts. 
These differences are not due to any 
different work options faced by female 
and male operators. Rather, the study 
found that the female operators had a 
greater demand for workplace flexi-
bility and a lower demand for overtime 
work hours than the male operators. 
Pay discrimination is wrong and al-
ready illegal. We probably cannot say 
that enough. Any new legislation to 
combat pay discrimination should be 
based on facts, not supposition, not 
projection. The facts seem to be sorely 
missing from this debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter from the Equal Rights Advocates in 
support of H.R. 7. 
EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES, 
April 14, 2021. 
Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) 
and vote no on harmful amendments. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As the House votes 
on the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7), Equal 
Rights Advocates strongly urges you to pass 
the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without 
amendments that limit its scope or under-
mine its critical protections. 
Equal Rights Advocates (ERA) is a na-
tional, non-profit legal organization based in 
San Francisco, California, whose mission is 
to protect and expand economic and edu-
cational access and opportunities for women 
and girls. We have a long history of working

April 15, 2021 
to address pay discrimination and to close 
the gender wage gap. We have litigated nu-
merous cases relating to pay discrimination 
and regularly provide information and re-
sources to employees who contact our free 
legal information hotline regarding unlawful 
gender and race-based pay disparities. 
We also advocate for various bills at the 
state-level to ensure economic and gender 
justice for women and families. Most re-
cently, ERA has co-sponsored SB 973 (Jack-
son, 2020) which requires California employ-
ers with 100 employees or more to submit an 
annual pay data report to the Department of 
Industrial Relations outlining the compensa-
tion and hours worked of its employees by 
gender, race, ethnicity, and job category. 
This allows state agencies to more effi-
ciently identify patterns of wage disparities 
and encourages employers to analyze their 
own pay practices to ensure they are fair and 
lawful. Additionally, ERA co-sponsored the 
California Fair Pay Act, SB 358, (Jackson, 
2016) which amended and strengthened our 
state’s Equal Pay Act to prohibit employer 
secrecy rules, clarify that workers must be 
paid equally to coworkers of another sex who 
perform substantially similar work, unless 
the employer proves that the disparity was 
due to a legitimate, job-related, bona fide 
factor not based on or derived from sex. We 
also cosponsored AB 168 (Eggman, 2017) 
which prohibits California employers from 
inquiring about prior salary and requires 
them to provide the pay Scale for a position 
in question upon reasonable request and AB 
2282 (Eggman, 2018) which clarified that prior 
salary cannot be used on its own, or in com-
bination with a lawful factor, to justify a 
wage differential under the California Equal 
Pay Act. Finally, ERA also chairs Equal Pay 
Today, a national collaboration of organiza-
tions working at the local, regional, and fed-
eral level to close the gender wage gap. 
Today in the United States, despite the 
passage of previous equal pay legislation, in-
cluding 
the 
critically 
important 
Lily 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the gender pay gap 
remains pervasive. Women, even those who 
work full-time and year round, still only 
earn 80 cents to a man’s dollar. This gives 
rise to a nationwide pay gap of $900 billion 
every year. For women of color, the pay gap 
is even larger. For every dollar earned by a 
non-Hispanic white man, Latina women earn 
only 53 cents, Native American women only 
58 cents, and Black women only 61 cents. 
These large pay gaps, although of varying 
sizes across demographics of women, prove 
harmful to the economic security of women 
and families across the country. The nega-
tive economic consequences of these gender 
pay gaps are especially pronounced as 
‘‘mothers are primary or sole breadwinners 
in half of U.S. households with children.’’ Of 
these female-headed households, one-quarter 
of them fall below the poverty line. 
As it stands, the gender and race pay gaps 
are closing at a glacial pace. At current 
rates, the gender wage gap will not close 
until 2059. For women of color, the picture is 
even bleaker. It will not be until 2124 that 
Black women receive equal pay to white men 
and not until 2233 that Latinas receive the 
same. Now is the time for action. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is an impor-
tant step in accelerating the closing of the 
gender pay gap. Among many provisions, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act would bar retaliation 
for discussing or disclosing wages. According 
to the Institute for Women’s Policy Re-
search, across the country, about half of 
workers were prohibited or strongly discour-
aged from disclosing their wages to other 
employees. Yet, when an individual is unable 
to discuss wages with other employees, it be-
comes exceedingly difficult to determine if 
one is making less than one’s colleagues. By 
ending the practice of pay secrecy, the Pay-
check Fairness Act would make it harder for 
employers to keep pervasive practices of pay 
discrimination hidden. 
In addition, the Paycheck Fairness Act 
would also prohibit employers from relying 
on salary history when setting the wages of 
their employees. This provision is critical as 
the practice of relying on prior salary can 
lead to a single act of pay discrimination fol-
lowing a woman throughout her career. One 
year out of college, women are already earn-
ing 7 percent less than their male colleagues, 
even after controlling for factors such as col-
lege major, occupation, or hours worked. If a 
woman’s prior salary is used by future em-
ployers, the gender pay gap will continue to 
persist as a depressed past salary continues 
to be used to determine future wages. Pro-
hibiting employer reliance on salary history 
will help stop the perpetuation of unequal 
pay. 
Another crucial provision in this version of 
the Paycheck Fairness Act is the commit-
ment to pay data collection. As mentioned 
above, ERA fought for pay data collection at 
the California state-level and secured this 
via SB 973 (Jackson, 2020). The need to en-
sure equal pay is now more apparent than 
ever during the current COVID–19 health and 
economic crisis, which has exposed the last-
ing harm of unequal pay and other contribu-
tors to economic security on women, and in 
particular, women of color. Pay data collec-
tion helps uncover pay discrimination, which 
is a major contributor to the overall gender 
and race-based wage gaps. 
Recognizing that pay discrimination is dif-
ficult to detect and address, the Obama Ad-
ministration announced a proposed revision 
to the Employer Information Report (EEO–1) 
to include the reporting of pay data by gen-
der, race and ethnicity beginning in 2018. For 
more than 50 years, large companies have 
been submitting these EEO–1 reports with 
demographic information to the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 
This data has helped the agency to identify 
patterns of occupational segregation and dis-
crimination and enforce federal equal pay 
and anti-discrimination law. However, the 
Trump Administration put a halt to the im-
plementation of this new rule, dealing a sig-
nificant blow to the fight for equal pay. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would also 
close loopholes that allow employers to pay 
women less without a legitimate business 
justification and would provide the same ro-
bust remedies for sex-based pay discrimina-
tion as race and ethnicity based discrimina-
tion. It would also require wage data collec-
tion and support salary negotiation skills 
training programs to give women the tools 
to advocate for higher wages. Salary nego-
tiation workshops have been shown to be 
highly effective. For example, in a study 
conducted following the free salary negotia-
tion workshops put on by the city of Boston, 
the Center for Women in Politics and Public 
Policy at the University of Massachusetts 
Boston found that nearly half of the women 
who were interviewed had either successfully 
negotiated a pay raise or starting salary 
that brought them either to or above the 
market rate following the training. 
As the bill states, these continuing pay 
disparities have devastating impacts on 
women, especially women of color. Over the 
course of the COVID–19 pandemic, research-
ers have found this to be even more true. 
Since last February, 2.4 million women have 
exited the workforce, or, been pushed out of 
the workforce, highlighting a dramatic re-
gress for gender equity. More and more 
women are forced to stay home in order to 
care for children and loved ones while men 
continue to work. Before the pandemic, 
‘‘women did, on average, three times more 
unpaid care work than men, and this respon-
sibility has heightened since the pandemic 
given school and childcare closures, and in-
creased care needs for elderly relatives.’’ 
Women who are able to remain in the work-
force, however, are still paid less than their 
male colleagues, especially Black women and 
women of color. COVID–19 has exacerbated 
these long-standing gender and racial inequi-
ties. Now, more than ever, elected officials 
must recognize these disparate impacts and 
deliver solutions to American women. 
Without 
continued 
efforts 
to 
provide 
women with the tools to challenge and un-
earth pay discrimination and provisions to 
keep employers from perpetuating persistent 
inequalities, the gender pay gap will not 
close. The Paycheck Fairness Act is an im-
portant step on the path towards a future 
where women can stand on equal economic 
footing to their male counterparts. 
For these reasons, we are proud to support 
the Paycheck Fairness Act and urge you to 
pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
JESSICA STENDER, 
Senior Counsel, 
Workplace Justice & Public Policy. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, it 
should offend every one of us that 
there remains a pay gap between men 
and women for the same work. 
Women of color, in particular—Afri-
can-American women, Latina women, 
Native 
American 
women, 
AAPI 
women—are making as low as 52 cents, 
Mr. Speaker, for every dollar for the 
same job and work by a man. 
This is a travesty. 
Let’s make our communities strong-
er. Let’s make our economy stronger. 
In Harlem, East Harlem, northern 
Manhattan, and the northwest Bronx, 
women of color are the majority of 
workers. I can’t go back home to my 
district and say that somehow they are 
working the same as men, or maybe 
more, in many cases, and are making 
less. 
I support H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, because we need to bring fair-
ness into the discussion. Let’s make 
our communities stronger. Let’s make 
our economy stronger. 
Gender-based 
pay 
discrimination 
should not be something we are still 
discussing now in 2021. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act will put 
everyone on the line to make sure that 
we are all doing our best to ensure fair 
and equitable pay. 
Closing the pay gap will make women 
and families financially stronger. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s make our commu-
nities stronger. Let’s make our econ-
omy stronger.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1808 
April 15, 2021 
Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse 
membership of more than 220 organizations 
to promote and protect the rights of all per-
sons in the United States, we urge you to 
vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, 
without amendments that limit its scope or 
undermine its critical protections. The Pay-
check Fairness Act is a priority of The Lead-
ership Conference, and we will include your 
vote on final passage in our Voting Record 
for the 117th Congress. 
Gender-based 
pay 
discrimination 
com-
promises the economic security of millions 
of women in the United States—and for 
women of color, the harm is exacerbated by 
their experience of both race- and gender- 
based wage disparities. Women working full- 
time, year-round in the United States are 
typically paid about 82 cents for every dollar 
paid to men, adding up to a loss of more than 
$400,000 over a lifetime. Black women are 
typically paid only 63 cents for every dollar 
paid to non-Hispanic white men, while Na-
tive American women are paid only 60 cents, 
Latinas are paid just 55 cents, and women in 
certain Asian American and Pacific Islander 
communities are paid as little as 52 cents. 
Research shows that the gender pay gap oc-
curs across almost all occupations and indus-
tries, develops very early in women’s ca-
reers, and grows over time. 
Action to close the wage gap is long over-
due, but in light of the current economic cri-
sis, it is even more critical that Congress act 
now to strengthen protections against pay 
discrimination, both as a matter of economic 
security and fundamental fairness. The loss 
of income and savings from the wage gap has 
exacerbated the harmful effects of the 
COVID–19 pandemic for women of color and 
their families. Black and Brown women have 
been overrepresented in ‘‘frontline’’ jobs dur-
ing the pandemic—many in low-paid jobs at 
high risk of exposure to COVID–19 and with-
out benefits like paid leave and employer- 
sponsored health insurance—but they are 
paid less than non-Hispanic white men in the 
same jobs. Already struggling to make ends 
meet, women of color in low-pay jobs must 
also endure pay discrimination that artifi-
cially reduces their overall earnings, making 
it even less likely for women of color to 
amass the financial resources to withstand a 
health emergency and putting entire fami-
lies at risk of economic insecurity. Almost 75 
percent of Black mothers and more than 45 
percent of Latina mothers were bread-
winners in their families in 2018. At the same 
time, Black and Brown women have faced 
staggering job losses during the pandemic. 
The unemployment rate for Black women 
reached 17.4 percent in May 2020, for exam-
ple, and Latinas experienced the highest un-
employment rate of any group during the 
pandemic, at more than 20 percent in April 
of last year. The unemployment rate for 
Black women and Latinas remains excep-
tionally high. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would update 
and strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to 
provide more effective protection against 
sex-based pay discrimination. The Paycheck 
Fairness Act would: 
Prohibit retaliation against workers who 
discuss or disclose wages; 
Prevent employers from relying on salary 
history to determine future pay so that pay 
discrimination does not extend from job to 
job; 
Close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act that 
have allowed employers to pay women less 
than men for the same work without any 
business necessity related to the job; 
Ensure that women can obtain the same 
remedies for sex-based pay discrimination as 
those available to people subjected to dis-
crimination based on race and ethnicity; 
Provide for much-needed training and 
technical assistance and require wage data 
collection. 
Women and their families can no longer be 
shortchanged. Given the importance of this 
bill, we urge representatives to pass H.R. 7 
without amendments that limit the bill’s 
scope or undermine its protections. 
Sincerely, 
WADE HENDERSON, 
Interim President and 
CEO. 
LASHAWN WARREN, 
Executive Vice Presi-
dent for Government 
Affairs. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, for a quar-
ter of a century, Chairwoman DELAURO 
has been trying to get this bill passed. 
She is sick and tired, I am sick and 
tired, and American women are sick 
and tired of being treated like second- 
class citizens. 
Imagine if the women here in Con-
gress were being paid 60, 70, or 80 per-
cent of what our male colleagues are 
making. Do you think we would put up 
with it? Of course not. Somehow, 
American women are expected to put 
up with that. 
Do you want facts? Ask about Ms. 
Rexroat, from the State of Arizona, 
who was paid less than her colleague 
because they decided that they would 
base her salary on what she was mak-
ing before, as opposed to the job at 
hand. 
We have a problem, Mr. Speaker. 
This has been going on for way too 
long. It is time for us to fix it for all 
the women and children in this country 
who want to be paid equally for equal 
work so that they have money for 
childcare, rent, food, and education. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia (Ms. 
NORTON), the previous head of the 
EEOC. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter from the Amer-
ican Bar Association supporting pas-
sage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, 
April 13, 2021. 
Re ABA Urges Passage of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
American Bar Association (ABA), the largest 
voluntary association of lawyers and legal 
professionals in the world. I am writing to 
urge you to vote for passage of the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, which would update the Equal 
Pay Act of 1963 enacted by Congress almost 
60 years ago to prohibit gender-based pay in-
equality. This legislation, which is expected 
to come to the floor this week, has the sup-
port of working men and women across the 
country who want this nation to live up to 
its expressed commitment to equal pay for 
equal work. 
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits an em-
ployer from paying unequal wages to male 
and female workers who perform jobs under 
similar work conditions that require sub-
stantially equal skill, effort, and responsi-
bility unless there is a legitimate reason for 
a pay differential. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act does not alter 
the basic scheme of this statute or impose 
unreasonable burdens on employers; indeed, 
the majority of its proposed changes are bor-
rowed from other civil rights statutes that 
have proved more effective in eradicating 
workplace discrimination. 
We would like to respond to some per-
sistent misperceptions regarding this impor-
tant legislation: 
Enactment of this bill will not compel 
businesses to pay their female workforce 
substantially more money to eliminate the 
existing wage gap. The purpose of this bill is 
to update the Equal Pay Act, which only ap-
plies in situations where women or men are 
receiving unequal pay for equal work. It does 
not create a new mandate. Employers al-
ready have a legal obligation to pay men and 
women equal wages for equal work unless 
there is a legitimate reason for the differen-
tial. 
Enactment of this bill will not interject 
the government into the pay decisions of 
businesses. The Paycheck Fairness Act does 
not tell employers what factors to use to set 
pay; it only requires that pay decisions are 
job- and business-related. 
Enactment of this bill will not make em-
ployers liable for any and every wage dif-
ferential. An employer will still have four af-
firmative defenses and will not be guilty of 
wage discrimination if a pay differential is 
based on (i) seniority, (ii) merit, (iii) a sys-
tem that measures quantity or quality of 
production, or (iv) a ‘‘factor other than sex.’’ 
29 U.S.C. 206(d)(l). The only difference is that 
Paycheck Fairness Act will resolve uncer-
tainty in the law over how to apply the 
fourth defense by redefining it as ‘‘a bona 
fide factor other than sex, such as education, 
training, or experience.’’ 
Enactment of a provision to clarify the 
‘‘factor other than sex’’ defense will not evis-
cerate legitimate use of the defense. It is in-
tended to prevent employers from asserting 
that unequal pay was the result of market 
force-derived excuses such as prior salaries 
or negotiation outcomes. A bona fide factor 
other than sex must be job-related, con-
sistent with business necessity, and account 
for the entire differential in compensation at 
issue. The only time this defense would not 
apply would be in situations where an alter-
native employment practice is available that 
would serve the same business purpose with-
out producing the wage differential and the 
employer has refused to adopt it. 
Enactment of this bill will not encourage 
more lawsuits and jeopardize post-pandemic 
economic recovery. The bill is designed re-
solve uncertainties in the law and increase 
employer compliance with the Equal Pay 
Act, not to encourage more lawsuits. 
The bill’s strengthened remedies, which 
align with those available in other employ-
ment discrimination statutes, will encourage 
employers to review their wage-setting prac-
tices and rectify those that are based on in-
valid justifications. Men and women who are 
paid fairly have no incentive to jeopardize 
their jobs and subject themselves to costly, 
time-consuming, and emotionally taxing 
lawsuits brought against their employers. 
The bill’s clarification of the ‘‘factor other 
than sex’’ defense will not spawn new litiga-
tion. Instead, it will provide guidance to the 
courts and resolve uncertainty in the law. 
The standard, which is adapted from Title 
VII discrimination cases and codified in the 
Civil Rights Act of 1991, is one with which 
courts already are familiar. 
The bill will help strengthen the economy 
by improving the present and future eco-
nomic welfare of working women, who com-
prise about one-half of the workforce and are 
the primary breadwinner in more than 12 
million American families. 
We urge you to demonstrate your commit-
ment to equal pay for equal work by voting 
for the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
Thank you for your consideration of our 
views. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICIA LEE REFO.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1809 
April 15, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to strongly support H.R. 7, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, a critically im-
portant bill. 
As the first woman to chair the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, I enforced the Equal Pay Act. 
I particularly appreciate that H.R. 7 
would bring long-awaited strength to 
the EPA. 
I especially appreciate that Congress-
woman ROSA DELAURO, a great cham-
pion for equal pay, has included my 
Pay Equity for All Act in H.R. 7, where 
I will focus today. 
The Pay Equity for All Act would 
prohibit employers from asking job ap-
plicants their salary history. Even 
though many employers may not in-
tentionally discriminate against appli-
cants or employees based on gender, 
race, or ethnicity, setting wages based 
on salary history is routinely done in 
the workplace and can reinforce the 
wage gap. Evidence clearly shows that 
members of historically disadvantaged 
groups often start their careers with 
unfair and artificially low wages com-
pared to their White male counter-
parts, and these disparities are com-
pounded from job to job. 
Job and salary offers should be based 
on an applicant’s skill and merit, not 
on salary history. This bill addresses 
this problem by assessing penalties 
against employers who ask applicants 
for their salary history during the 
interview process. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 requires that the 
employer defense must be consistent 
with ‘‘business necessity,’’ a broad and 
ill-defined term. 
We don’t know how the courts will 
interpret this sweeping requirement, 
but we do know the dictionary says it 
means ‘‘absolutely essential’’ or ‘‘indis-
pensable.’’ 
How can an employer prove that any 
one factor determining employee pay 
could rise to the level to be necessary 
for the survival of the business? 
Proponents of H.R. 7 will argue this 
phrase has been adopted from title VII, 
as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights 
Act, but the phrase has spawned end-
less litigation because of its lack of 
clarity. Anyone who thinks this con-
cept is simple and can just be carried 
over from title VII is either naive or 
has been misled. 
Further, the dubious concept of busi-
ness necessity was developed under 
controversial so-called disparate im-
pact analysis and cannot simply be 
slapped onto the Equal Pay Act, espe-
cially where, as mandated by H.R. 7, 
damages are unlimited. In contrast, 
under title VII, in disparate impact 
cases, damages are limited to backpay 
and benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill is really about mothers and 
daughters who earn about 82 cents on 
the dollar for every dollar a man earns. 
It is about mothers and daughters who 
lose about $1 trillion a year because of 
the wage gap. 
For those men who don’t have a real-
ly good reason to vote for it, it is about 
the fact that a woman gave birth to 
every man alive. So for all of the suf-
fering, we ought to vote for this bill, 
because we are here as a result of some 
woman suffering for us. 
At this time, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the National Committee 
on Pay Equity. 
NATIONAL COMMITTEE 
ON PAY EQUITY, 
April 14, 2021. 
Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) 
and vote no on harmful amendments. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As the House votes 
on the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7), the 
National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) 
strongly urges you to pass the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without amendments 
that limit its scope or undermine its critical 
protections. 
The National Committee on Pay Equity 
(NCPE), founded in 1979, is a coalition of 
women’s and civil rights organizations; labor 
unions; religious, professional, and edu-
cational 
associations, 
commissions 
on 
women, state and local pay equity coalitions 
and individuals working to eliminate sex- 
and race-based wage discrimination and to 
achieve pay equity. These pay gaps can be 
addressed only if workers have the legal 
tools necessary to challenge discrimination 
and employers are provided with effective in-
centives and technical assistance to comply 
with the law. The Paycheck Fairness Act is 
one of these urgently required tools. 
Despite federal and state equal pay laws, 
gender pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to 
these gaps are exacerbating the financial ef-
fects of COVID–19, falling particularly heav-
ily on women of color and the families who 
depend on their income. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, which has been passed three pre-
vious times by the House of Representatives, 
mostly recently in the 116th Congress, offers 
a much-needed update to the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963 by providing new tools to battle per-
vasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimina-
tion. 
Women are increasingly the primary or co- 
breadwinner in their families and cannot af-
ford to be shortchanged any longer. Women 
working full-time, year-round are typically 
paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to 
men, adding up to a loss of more than 
$400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap varies 
by race and is larger for many women of 
color: Black women working full time, year 
round typically make only 63 cents, Native 
American women only 60 cents, and Latinas 
only 55 cents, for every dollar paid to their 
white, 
non-Hispanic 
male 
counterparts. 
Latinas lose more than $1 million over a 40- 
year career due to the wage gap. While Asian 
American 
and 
Pacific 
Islander 
(AAPI) 
women make 85 cents for every dollar paid to 
white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI com-
munities experience drastically wider pay 
gaps. And even when controlling for factors, 
such as education and experience, pay gaps 
persist and start early in women’s careers 
and contribute to a wealth gap that follows 
them throughout their work lives and into 
retirement. Persistent pay discrimination, 
often cloaked by employer-imposed pay se-
crecy policies, is one factor driving these 
wage gaps. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and 
strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to en-
sure that it provides robust protection 
against sex-based pay discrimination. Among 
other provisions, this comprehensive bill: 
ends secrecy around pay by barring retalia-
tion against workers who voluntarily discuss 
or disclose their wages, and requiring em-
ployers to report pay data to the EEOC 
prohibits employers from relying on salary 
history in determining future pay, so that 
pay discrimination does not follow women 
from job to job 
closes loopholes that have allowed employ-
ers to pay women less than men for the same 
work without any important business jus-
tification related to the job 
ensures women can receive the same ro-
bust remedies for sex-based pay discrimina-
tion that are currently available to those 
subjected to discrimination based on race 
and ethnicity 
provides much needed training and tech-
nical assistance, as well as data collection 
and research 
The COVID–19 pandemic and systemic rac-
ism have exposed how the work performed 
primarily by women, and particularly Black 
and brown women, has long been and con-
tinues to be undervalued and underpaid, even 
as the rest of the country is newly recog-
nizing the essential nature of this work. We 
cannot build back an economy that works 
for everyone without ensuring that all 
women can work with equality, safety, and 
dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing 
the Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vi-
tally important step toward ensuring this 
becomes reality. 
We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness 
Act 
without 
harmful 
amendments 
that 
weaken its critical protections. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN YORK, 
Secretary-Treasurer, 
National Committee on Pay Equity. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
this year marks the 58th anniversary of 
the Equal Pay Act. Despite the goal to 
ensure equality for women in the work-
place, nearly 60 years later, the pay 
gap still exists. 
Women today, on average, make 82 
cents for every dollar earned by a man. 
For women of color, the disparity is 
worse, with Black women making 63 
cents on the dollar, AAPI women mak-
ing 60 cents, and Latinas making 55 
cents. 
This disparity is unacceptable, and it 
is unfair. 
Let us come together right now to 
pass H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
When women get equal pay, our fami-
lies and our entire economy will do 
better. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the United Church of Christ in favor of 
H.R. 7. 
UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We are writing to 
ask for your support in passage of the Pay-
check Fairness Act (H.R. 7), and to ensure 
that passage in the House is done without 
amendments that diminish the protections 
provided by the bill. 
There is ample evidence to show that de-
spite equal pay laws, the gender pay gap ex-
ists. These lost earnings add up to a loss of 
over $400,000 in a lifetime. The wage gap is 
even more significant for women of color

with Black women working full time making 
only 63 cents for every dollar paid to men, 
Native American women only 60 cents, and 
Latinas only 55 cents, for every dollar paid 
to their white, non-Hispanic male counter-
parts. 
As people of faith, we believe that each 
person deserves to be treated with dignity 
and humanity. When women are paid less for 
the same work that is a concrete and explicit 
way 
of 
showing 
that 
their 
work 
and 
personhood are valued less. Passage of the 
Paycheck Fairness Act will strengthen and 
update the Equal Pay Act and provide 
women with the legal means to fight the 
gender pay gap and challenge gender pay dis-
crimination. 
The work done by women, and particularly 
Black and brown women, is undervalued and 
underpaid. Even though much of that labor 
is what keeps people fed, clothed, and cared 
for. The work of women, so important to how 
a society functions is always relegated to 
less pay and less value. This is a gross injus-
tice—and part of the systemic racist struc-
tures that undergird the economic system in 
the United States. God’s vision for our world 
is one where all are valued, no matter their 
gender, race, or credo. 
We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness 
Act 
without 
harmful 
amendments 
that 
weaken its critical protections. 
THE UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST 
JUSTICE AND WITNESS MINISTRIES 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, we all 
agree that every American should be 
compensated for the quality of their 
work and not face discrimination in 
the workplace based on race, color, na-
tional origin, religion, or sex. 
That is why Congress passed the 
Equal Pay Act in 1963 and broader non-
discrimination laws under title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act the following year. 
However, unlike those bills, H.R. 7 of-
fers no new protections. It is simply a 
messaging bill to score political points. 
What will the bill actually do? For 
job creators, they can expect more law-
suits and more regulatory burdens. 
While 
limiting 
legal 
options 
for 
women by changing EPA class action 
lawsuits from an opt-in system to a 
mandatory opt-out system, H.R. 7 al-
lows trial lawyers to pursue unlimited 
compensatory 
damages, 
making 
it 
nearly impossible for employers to de-
fend against frivolous lawsuits. 
Additionally, it requires employers 
to make intrusive data disclosures to 
the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission regarding the sex, race, 
and national origin of employees and, 
for the first time, the hiring, termi-
nation, and promotion data of those 
employees, ultimately posing a threat 
to workers’ privacy. 
The compliance costs to satisfy these 
requirements can total more than $600 
million a year. We have already seen a 
number of small businesses forced to 
close this year because of COVID 
lockdowns, and now my Democratic 
colleagues want to impose more regu-
latory burdens on businesses that were 
lucky enough to survive. 
Thankfully, my colleague from New 
York, Congresswoman ELISE STEFANIK, 
has a solution that will actually ad-
dress pay discrimination and support 
women in the workplace. The Wage Eq-
uity Act protects workers’ privacy by 
encouraging voluntary pay analysis 
while bolstering women’s employment 
through the creation of a grant pro-
gram for women in college or career 
and technical programs to provide ne-
gotiation skills education. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 7 
and work with Republicans on mean-
ingful legislation to ensure all workers 
have the opportunity and wages they 
deserve.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise us how much time is 
available on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 141⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 111⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights 
and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. 
The Equal Pay Act has been the law 
for more than half a century, but, in 
2021, equal pay for equal work is still 
not a reality for many women, espe-
cially women of color. This is an injus-
tice to millions of working families. 
Closing the wage gap is an economic 
imperative. 
Last month, I was honored to chair 
the hearing on persistent gender-based 
wage discrimination. We heard wit-
nesses describe the barriers to detect-
ing wage discrimination and holding 
employers accountable. Most impor-
tantly, we heard how the Paycheck 
Fairness Act can address the problem-
atic loopholes in the current law, em-
power workers to better detect and 
combat wage discrimination, and cre-
ate mechanisms for better pay data 
transparency. 
By advancing the Paycheck Fairness 
Act, we can restore the original intent 
of the Equal Pay Act and finally make 
equal pay for equal work a reality. I 
thank Congresswoman DELAURO
for 
her steadfast leadership. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter in support of the Paycheck 
Fairness Act from the American Asso-
ciation of University Women. 
AAUW, 
April 14, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
more than 170,000 members and supporters of 
the American Association of University 
Women (AAUW), I urge you to vote in sup-
port of the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) 
and to oppose harmful amendments when the 
bill comes to the House floor this week. De-
spite federal and state equal pay laws, gen-
der pay gaps persist. The Paycheck Fairness 
Act offers a much needed update to the 
Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools 
to battle these pervasive pay gaps and to 
challenge discrimination. 
The dual crises of a global pandemic and 
systemic racism have laid bare the economic 
disparities in our country. While we all 
struggle to survive, we are relying heavily 
on the work performed by essential workers 
who are disproportionately Black and brown 
women. Yet their work has long been and 
continues to be undervalued and underpaid. 
At the same time, in 2020, American women 
lost more than 5 million jobs. Women ac-
counted for 100% of the jobs lost last Decem-
ber—all 140,000 of them—and women of color 
made up an overwhelming share of those 
jobs. This massive job loss coupled with the 
consistent undervaluing of women’s work 
compounds over time and results in signifi-
cant lost earnings. As a result, women do not 
have a financial cushion to help weather the 
current economic crisis or the ability to 
build wealth, all of which contribute to ra-
cial and gender wealth gaps that create bar-
riers to families’ economic prosperity. We 
cannot build back our economy without im-
mediately addressing these realities. And 
women and their families cannot afford to 
wait any longer for change. 
To appropriately respond to the crises we 
are currently experiencing we must make 
real, concrete progress in ensuring all 
women receive fair pay. While the gap has 
narrowed since passage of the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963, progress has largely stalled in recent 
years. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau 
once again revealed that women working 
full-time, year-round are typically paid only 
82 cents for every dollar paid to men. The 
pay gaps are even wider for women of color. 
Black women and Latinas make, respec-
tively, 63 and 55 cents on the dollar as com-
pared to non-Hispanic, white men. Action is 
required now: at the current rate, the overall 
pay gap between men’s and women’s earn-
ings will not close until 2093 and it will take 
significantly longer for women of color to 
reach parity. 
Research indicates that the gender pay gap 
develops very early in women’s careers. Con-
trolling for factors known to affect earnings, 
such as education and training, marital sta-
tus, and hours worked, research finds that 
college-educated women still earn 7 percent 
less than men just one year out of college. 
Over time, the gap compounds and widens, 
impacting women’s social security and re-
tirement. Ensuring that women have equal 
pay would have a dramatic impact on fami-
lies and the economy. According to a report 
from the Institute for Women’s Policy Re-
search (IWPR), the poverty rate for all work-
ing women would be cut in half, falling from 
8.0 percent to 3.8 percent if women were paid 
the same as comparable men. The same 
study indicates that the U.S. economy would 
have produced an additional $512.6 billion in 
income if women had received equal pay for 
equal work. This is why I urge you to pass 
this important bill. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would update 
and strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to 
ensure that it provides effective protection 
against sex-based pay discrimination in to-
day’s workplace. 
The bill takes several important steps, in-
cluding: 
Guaranteeing Non-Retaliation: The bill 
prohibits retaliation against workers for dis-
cussing or disclosing wages. Without the 
non-retaliation provisions of the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, many women will continue to 
be silenced in the workplace—that is, prohib-
ited from talking about wages with cowork-
ers without the fear of being fired. This is an 
issue that keeps women—like it kept Lilly 
Ledbetter—from learning of the pay dis-
crimination against them. 
Prohibiting Reliance on Prior Salary His-
tory: The bill prohibits employers from rely-
ing on salary history in determining future 
pay, so that prior discrimination doesn’t fol-
low workers from job to job.

April 15, 2021 
Requiring Job-Relatedness: The bill closes 
loopholes that allow employers to pay 
women less than men for the same work 
without a business necessity that is related 
to the job. 
Equalizing Remedies: The bill ensures 
women can receive the same robust remedies 
for sex-based pay discrimination that are 
currently available to those subjected to dis-
crimination based on race and ethnicity. 
Providing Additional Assistance and Re-
sources: The bill also provides technical as-
sistance to businesses, requires wage data 
collection, and supports salary negotiation 
skills training programs to give women the 
tools to advocate for higher wages. 
The pay gap is persistent and can only be 
addressed if women are armed with the tools 
necessary 
to 
challenge 
discrimination 
against them, and employers are provided 
with effective incentives and technical as-
sistance to comply with the law. I urge you 
to take a critical step towards pay equity by 
voting in support of the Paycheck Fairness 
Act (H.R. 7) and opposing harmful amend-
ments when the bill comes to the House floor 
this week. 
Cosponsorship and votes associated with 
this bill may be scored in the AAUW Action 
Fund Congressional Voting Record for the 
117th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
KATE NIELSON, 
Senior Director of Public Policy, 
Legal Advocacy & Research. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. An-
other provision in H.R. 7 requires that, 
in addition to proving business neces-
sity, an employer must prove the busi-
ness necessity accounts for 100 percent 
of the differential in compensation at 
issue. This is impossible to do. How can 
an employer explain slight differences 
in compensation based on educational 
level, experience, or quality of work on 
the job? 
This bill is going to make it impos-
sible for employers to pay differen-
tially on merit for anything. It is a bad 
bill, and we should not be passing it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this 
Nation has made far too little progress 
in the fight for equal pay in the work-
place. In 2021, women who work full 
time year round are paid, on average, 
only 82 cents for every dollar paid to 
men. This adds up to over $400,000 in 
lost wages over the course of a wom-
an’s career. 
For women of color, the gender gap is 
a gender chasm, with Latinas earning 
55 cents, Black women earning 63 
cents, and Asian American and Pacific 
Islander women earning a mere 52 
cents for every dollar paid to a White 
man for the same work. 
The long overdue Paycheck Fairness 
Act would bring us closer to closing 
these gaps by ensuring equal pay for 
equal work. Notably, it would hold em-
ployers accountable for discriminatory 
practices, end pay secrecy, ease work-
ers’ ability to challenge pay discrimi-
nation, and strengthen the available 
remedies for wronged employees. 
I thank Congresswoman DELAURO for 
her tireless advocacy on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter of support from the National 
Women’s Law Center.

non-Hispanic male counterparts. Latinas 
lose more than $1 million over a 40-year ca-
reer due to the wage gap. While Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women 
make 85 cents for every dollar paid to white, 
non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities 
experience drastically wider pay gaps. Moth-
ers typically make only 75 cents for every 
dollar paid to fathers. And even when con-
trolling for factors, such as education and

wealth gap that follows them throughout

We must put an end to the wage gap

you, as you have heard, the wage gap

I am reminded today of our heroine, 
Fannie Lou Hamer. She said, ‘‘I am 
sick and tired of being sick and tired.’’ 
Black women earn 63 cents, indige-
nous women earn 60 cents, Latinas earn

advocating for legislation that will ulti-
mately close the gender wage gap.

despite federal and state equal pay laws, the 
gender pay gap persists, and earnings lost to 
these gaps are widened due to the financial 
impacts of the pandemic, with a heavier bur-
den bared by women of color and the families 
and communities who depend on them and 
their income. 
Women are increasingly becoming the pri-
mary or co-breadwinner in their families, 
with Black mothers being far more likely 
than other mothers to be the primary or sole 
breadwinners for their families and more 
than half of Latina mothers being the bread-

Women across this country, working full- 
time, year-round, are typically being paid 
only .82 cents for every dollar paid out to 
men, adding up to a loss of more than 
$400,000 dollars over a lifetime. And the wage 
gap gets even wider as race is factored in. 
Black women working full time, year round 
typically make only .63 cents, Native Amer-
ican women only .60 cents, and Latinas only 
.55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, 
non-Hispanic male counterparts. Latinas 
stand to lose more than $1 million over a 40– 
year career due to the wage gap, and while 
Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) 
women make .85 cents for every dollar paid 
to white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI 
communities experience drastically wider 
pay gaps. And even when controlling for fac-
tors, such as education and experience, the 
pay gaps still persist, start early in women’s 
careers and contribute to a wealth gap that 
follows them throughout their lifetimes. 
These pay gaps can be addressed and rec-
tified through legislation that offers workers 
the legal tools and safeguards needed to 
challenge 
discrimination. 
The 
Paycheck 
Fairness Act, which has already been passed 
by the House of Representatives three times 
before and most recently by the 116th Con-
gress, would offer the much needed updates 
to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by making these 
tools available while also providing new 
ones, that would help to combat and chal-
lenge discrimination and the pay gap. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and 
strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to en-
sure that it provides robust protection 
against sex-based pay discrimination. Among 
other provisions, this comprehensive bill: 
ends secrecy around pay by barring retalia-
tion against workers who voluntarily discuss 
or disclose their wages, and requiring em-
ployers to report pay data to the EEOC 
prohibits employers from relying on salary 
history in determining future pay, so that 
pay discrimination does not follow women 
from job to job 
closes loopholes that have allowed employ-
ers to pay women less than men for the same 
work without any important business jus-
tification related to the job 
ensures women can receive the same ro-
bust remedies for sex-based pay discrimina-
tion that are currently available to those 
subjected to discrimination based on race 
and ethnicity 
provides much needed training and tech-
nical assistance, as well as data collection 
and research 
This past year has undoubtedly been a 
challenging one. The pandemic has shone a 
light on how the work performed by women, 
specifically Black and brown women, has 
continuously been undervalued, underpaid, 
and gone unnoticed. We cannot continue to 
use the word ‘‘essential’’ to describe the na-
ture of this work, if there is no commitment 
to ensuring that all women can work with 
safety and with dignity, and the first step to 
making this happen, starts with pay equity, 
and the catalyst for this would be the pass-
ing of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness 
Act 
without 
harmful 
amendments 
that 
weaken its critical protections. 
Thank you for your time and consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
EQUAL PAY TODAY. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
let me finally say: Remember, because 
of this discrimination, women’s Social 
Security benefits during their senior 
years are much lower than men. This 
injustice follows women throughout 
their lives. This issue impacts women, 
regardless of industry, education level 
or political party. It is past time—it is 
so past time for Congress to take ac-
tion on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 would create im-
possible conditions in which to operate 
for businessowners large and small. It 
would result in endless litigation in 
front of judges and juries, who will 
delve into employer compensation de-
cisions even when there has been a 
showing that those decisions are not 
based on sex. 
Alternatively, 
businessowners 
will 
simply decide not to risk liability of 
unlimited damages, which could bank-
rupt them, and the end result will be 
the use of pay bands by employers, 
which imposes a government civil serv-
ice model on the private sector that 
will result in everyone in the work-
place being compensated equally with-
out regard to merit. 
This is a very broad goal of liberals 
in general: Pay everybody the same 
and stifle innovation, stifle initiative, 
stifle anybody being different. 
This is the wrong thing for our coun-
try. That is not the way the United 
States of America operates. We value 
innovation, we value entrepreneurism, 
we value independent thinking. We 
don’t want to crush everybody into 
thinking the same way. That is the 
way civil service works. That is the 
way the unions work. That is not the 
way it should be in private industry, 
which has made this country great. 
This bill stalls upward mobility. It 
hurts all employees striving to succeed 
on the job, who want to be rewarded for 
their efforts. 
For these reasons and others, H.R. 7’s 
provisions are unworkable and will 
benefit only trial lawyers, not innova-
tive, hardworking workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished 
Speaker 
of 
the 
United 
States House of Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
leadership in bringing this important 
legislation to the floor of the House. 
This is about building back better 
with women, not stifling innovation 
and entrepreneurship, but reaping the 
benefits of all that women have to offer 
in our country. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 60 years ago, 
President John F. Kennedy signed the 
Equal Pay Act into law, lauding it as 
‘‘a measure that adds to our laws an-
other structure basic to democracy.’’ 
Today, I rise in support of a similarly 
momentous measure for our democ-
racy, 
the 
Paycheck 
Fairness 
Act, 
which will strengthen that law and re-
affirm this pledge: equal work deserves 
equal pay. 
We all salute Chairwoman ROSA 
DELAURO, the guardian angel of this 
legislation, and so much of what Demo-
crats’ work on behalf of women and 
families. Chairwoman DELAURO is re-
lentless, introducing this bill in each of 
the last 13 Congresses and securing bi-
partisan support and the support of the 
entire House Democratic Caucus. And 
now, because of her leadership, we have 
a chance for it to become law. 
Many of us, with Chair DELAURO at 
the helm, have helped lead the charge 
for equal pay for many years now. 
Twelve years ago, House Democrats 
passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act to protect women’s right to chal-
lenge unfair pay in the courts. We are 
proud that President Obama made this 
bill the first bill he signed into law. 
You talked about it earlier, Mr. Chair-
man. 
Exactly 10 years later, when Demo-
crats retook the majority, we were 
honored to stand with Lilly Ledbetter, 
that courageous woman, as we took an-
other step forward for pay equity by 
again 
introducing 
Congresswoman 
DELAURO’s bill, the Paycheck Fairness 
Act. 
Today, a Democratic Congress led by 
over 120 women in the House; with an 
administration led by President Biden, 
a longtime champion of women; and 
the 
first 
woman 
Vice 
President, 
KAMALA
HARRIS; and with a record 
number of women in the Cabinet, those 
are great advances for women. 
We will pass this landmark bill once 
more, send it to the Senate, and then, 
hopefully, to President Biden to sign 
into law. 
I am the mother of four daughters. I 
don’t know anybody who has a daugh-
ter, a wife, a sister, a mother who can 
say to them, You are not worth it; your 
time is not worth the time of your 
brother, your father, your whoever 
else. 
What father, brother or son would 
not want the women in their lives to 
have equal pay? 
Sadly, equal pay is not yet a reality 
in America. Nearly six decades after 
the passage of the Equal Pay Act, 
women working full time year round 
are paid only 82 cents for every dollar 
paid to men. 
And for women of color, the disparity 
is even greater. It is almost sinful. For 
Black women, it is 63 cents; Native Ha-
waiian, Pacific Islander, American In-
dian, and Alaska Native women, 60 
cents; and a Latina is making just 55 
cents for every dollar for the same 
work as men. 
Equal work, equal hours, equal ef-
forts, but not equal pay. And this is not 
just about cents on a dollar. This pay

gap can add up to about $400,000 in lost 
wages over a career. 
What does that mean to a woman’s 
pension? 
At the same time, the need for action 
has been accelerated by the pandemic, 
which has worsened economic dispari-
ties for women. Last year, women lost 
a net 5.4 million jobs during the reces-
sion, with losses disproportionately ex-
perienced by women of color. 
This unjust, uneven toll on women is 
expected to widen the wage gap by up 
to 5 percentage points. Widen the gap 
by 5 percentage points, even as the 
economy recovers. 
As the House passes this landmark 
legislation, 
let 
us 
stand 
proudly, 
unapologetically for what this does for 
the economy of our country. We con-
tinue to work to advance progress for 
women and families. With the strong 
support of President Biden, the House 
Democrats are proud to have passed 
and sent to the Senate our bipartisan 
VAWA reauthorization led by Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE; leg-
islation to remove the arbitrary dead-
line for ERA ratification led by Con-
gresswoman JACKIE
SPEIER; and to 
have enacted the American Rescue 
Plan, which is helping many women to 
return to the workforce. 
b 1330 
And we will continue this drumbeat 
of action ensuring that the Senate 
passes the Paycheck Fairness Act and 
advancing legislation to strengthen 
women’s 
access 
to 
childcare, 
healthcare, 
workplace 
safety, 
and 
more. 
And as we move forward to ‘‘build 
back better,’’ President Biden’s alliter-
ative phrase for how we have job cre-
ation in our country, we can only build 
back better if women are central to 
that effort. Advancing an economy in a 
country that works for all of the people 
in America is very important to Amer-
ica’s families and America’s children. 
I urge a strong and, hopefully, bipar-
tisan vote on H.R. 7, the Paycheck 
Fairness Act. Fairness is an all-Amer-
ican quality. Fairness for women is es-
sential because we know that when 
women succeed, America succeeds. 
I thank Congresswoman DELAURO 
and Chairman SCOTT for their leader-
ship. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ms. FOXX very much for yielding. I ap-
preciate the opportunity to speak, Mr. 
Speaker. 
All Americans, men and women, 
should be treated equally and receive 
equal pay for equal work. I happen to 
be the father of two daughters, and I 
will do everything in this House to en-
sure that that continues to be the case 
and is, in fact, the case. 
If this truly were an Equal Pay Act, 
Mr. Speaker, I think we would have a 
bipartisan initiative here. We would 
have bipartisan agreement. The prob-
lem is this is not what it is, Mr. Speak-
er, it goes well beyond dealing with 
equal pay. 
What it does is it provides equal pay 
for as many attorneys and trial law-
yers as possible. And therein lies the 
problem. Once again, we have what 
looks like legitimate legislation that 
sounds good and feels good, Mr. Speak-
er, yet when you look at the details, it 
is far left extremism, which poisons the 
legislation and doesn’t allow reason-
able Members like myself to be sup-
portive. 
And this isn’t the first time. This oc-
curs very often, and it is the reason 
why we don’t get things done, nor do 
we get bipartisan cooperation. Because 
cooperation is the way that we will 
achieve and complete bills of impor-
tance, particularly that are named 
equal pay for all, equality for all. 
That is what our goal is. It would be 
great if a bill like this had the sub-
stance that provided the ingredients to 
provide for equal pay. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the majority leader of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Virginia, 
the 
chairman of the Education and Labor 
Committee for yielding, and I thank 
him for his untiring work. 
‘‘No employer . . . shall discriminate, 
within any establishment in which 
such employees are employed, between 
employees on the basis of sex, by pay-
ing wages to employees in such estab-
lishment at a rate less than the rate at 
which he pays wages to employees of 
the opposite sex.’’ 
That was passed by the Congress of 
the United States, signed by the Presi-
dent of the United States in 1963. A half 
a century later, Mr. Speaker, the fig-
ures belie that promise. The figures are 
a shameful recognition of the empti-
ness of that promise. 
Now, I know the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina, not well, but well 
enough. We have served here together 
for some period of time. I hope she will 
take this with a measure of positivity. 
She is a feisty lady. She stands up for 
what she believes. And she is tough. All 
those things are said lovingly. God help 
us if they paid her less than they paid 
every male Member of this House. 
But we don’t. We pay everybody the 
same, except, I will admit, the Speaker 
and myself, so perhaps I am not quite 
as detached. But everybody else gets 
the same. A person who comes in the 
first day gets paid as much as a person 
who has been here 40 years like me. 
Why? Because it is the responsibility 
and duties that we perform that are 
being compensated, not our gender. 
Now, in this bill and every other bill 
that has dealt with equal pay—how-
ever, let there be no mistake, clearly, I 
pay people in my office who have been 
there for 10 years more than I pay peo-
ple that have been there a year if they 
are doing the same thing. Period. Expe-
rience counts. 
As a lawyer when I ran my law office, 
I paid people differently based upon 
their experience, their education, and 
other differentials, but not on the basis 
of gender. And like the gentleman who 
spoke before me, I have one more 
daughter than he has; he has two 
daughters, I have three daughters. Mr. 
Speaker, they would not be happy 
today if their dad came to this floor 
and voted against this bill, I will tell 
you that. I don’t know about the gen-
tleman’s daughters, but I can tell you 
where my daughters would be. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to bring the 
Paycheck Fairness Act to the floor, as 
I did last Congress. The legislation is a 
critical part of Democrats’ effort to 
close the gender pay gap and ensure 
that women earn equal pay for equal 
work. Lilly Ledbetter did not get equal 
pay for equal work. Period. Unfortu-
nately, she was prevented by the Su-
preme Court from making her case. We 
corrected that. 
The House passed a bill in 2019, but 
the 
Republican-controlled 
Senate 
failed to do the same, a bill just like 
this. That was very disappointing, not 
only to those of us who have been 
working hard to close the gender pay 
gap in Congress, but more so to the 
tens of millions of people in the work-
force who deserve to take home pay 
they have earned. This is not a gift. 
This is compensation based upon abil-
ity and contribution, not on gender. 
In America today, a woman still 
earns on average just 82 cents to every 
dollar earned by a man. Mr. Chairman, 
has that been disputed on this floor? 
From women of color it is even worse. 
African-American women earn on aver-
age only 63 cents to the dollar, while 
Latinas see 55 cents for the same work. 
For women who work full time, year- 
round, the gender pay gap represents a 
loss of more than, as the Speaker just 
said, $400,000. That ought to be unac-
ceptable to all of us if we believe in 
equality. 
This disparity does not only hurt 
women, it disadvantages their entire 
families, with women’s pay critical to 
household incomes. 
Two-thirds of women are now either 
the primary breadwinner or co-bread-
winner of their households, and wom-
en’s earnings are the main source of in-
come in more than 4 in 10 households, 
40 percent. 
Now, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina knows full well that histori-
cally we have underpaid women be-
cause we thought men were the bread-
winners. They were the people who 
earned the money. They were the peo-
ple who needed money so they could 
support their families. That is not true 
today, if it was ever true. Those house-
holds ought not to be disadvantaged 
because women are paid less for the 
same work as their male counterparts. 
I mentioned in 1963 the promise we 
made as a Nation. In 2009, when I was 
majority leader for the first time, I was 
proud to bring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
Pay Act to the floor and get it passed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1814 
April 15, 2021 
I congratulate ROSA DELAURO who is 
on the floor today, Mr. Speaker. She 
has been indefatigable and focused and 
untiring—I suppose that is redundant— 
in her efforts to ensure that women 
were treated equally. And one of the 
best ways to treat people equally is pay 
them the same thing for the same job. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on 
its success by making it harder for 
businesses to hide the underpayment of 
women in their employ through non-
disclosure contracts and imposing new 
civil penalties for those who violate 
equal pay rules, among other beneficial 
provisions. 
Now, this has been in effect for half a 
century, and we haven’t gotten there. 
Do we need some, yeah, let’s get it 
done, this is what the law said in 1963? 
And we really meant it. So let’s carry 
that out so when the bipartisan, non-
partisan reports are made as to who is 
making what for the same job, it will 
come back men and women are getting 
the same pay for the same job with the 
same skills and the same seniority. 
I hope the Senate will take up this 
long overdue legislation and pass it so 
President Biden can sign it into law 
and at long last make good on the 
promise of the Equal Pay Act nearly 
six decades ago. 
I thank my friend, as I just did, ROSA 
DELAURO for the work she has done. I 
thank Ms. DELAURO on behalf of Susan, 
on behalf of Stefany, on behalf of Anne, 
my daughters, on behalf of Judy and 
Ava and Brooklyn and Savannah, my 
three great granddaughters and my 
granddaughter. What she has done, 
what we can do will make a difference 
for them, their families, and our coun-
try. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I thank the majority leader for his 
compliments of me. When Howard 
Coble first introduced me to the Repub-
lican Conference here he said, I was ‘‘a 
feisty mountain woman from the Blue 
Ridge, who goes bear hunting with a 
switch.’’ And so I have cherished that 
description of me over the years. I am 
a feisty woman because I grew up ex-
traordinarily poor. 
And the majority leader is correct, I 
would 
not 
tolerate 
discrimination 
against me. I won’t tolerate discrimi-
nation against anyone. I abhor dis-
crimination. I am also an Italian 
American. I abhor that kind of dis-
crimination and have fought against 
that. I fought against racial discrimi-
nation. I doubt there are many people 
in this body that fought more against 
discrimination against women than I 
have or mentored more women than I 
have. 
However, the majority leader also 
said something that made me think of 
the phrase, ‘‘all things being equal.’’ 
Well, rarely are all things equal. Obvi-
ously, when all things are equal, we 
want no discrimination, everybody to 
be treated the same. That is what I 
want. 
I have one child, a daughter. I have 
two grandchildren, a grandson and a 
granddaughter. I certainly don’t want 
either 
one 
of 
them 
discriminated 
against on the basis of anything. 
But, I say to Mr. HOYER, yes, 82 cents 
has been disputed. We hear the same 
old tired ‘‘statistics.’’ They are not ac-
curate. So let’s stop doing that. Let’s 
deal with the facts. 
H.R. 7 is not the answer to discrimi-
nation. It is going to make it more dif-
ficult for employers to create jobs and 
to pay women and everybody equally. 
We need alternatives and we have one. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire as to the time remaining 
on both sides, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCEACHIN). The gentleman from Vir-
ginia has 91⁄4 minutes remaining. The 
gentlewoman from North Carolina has 
41⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), a co- 
chair 
of 
the 
Democratic 
Women’s 
Caucus. 
b 1345 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is 
beyond me that in 2021 we are still hav-
ing this debate on whether men and 
women are paid equally. And I just 
want to say to my colleague on the 
other side, being a Black woman in 
America, I can tell you I do not feel 
that she has had the discrimination 
and the disrespect in the pay scale that 
women of color have experienced. And 
during the brunt of this pandemic 
where women are in the forefront, 
those who are frontline workers, the 
service 
industry—predominantly 
women. Paycheck fairness corrects this 
injustice by allowing women to chal-
lenge pay discrimination and hold em-
ployers accountable. 
Many in this Chamber like to talk 
about leveling the playing field for all 
Americans. Then let’s do it by passing 
this bill. And in America, when you 
walk in the room as a woman, you 
know you have overcome and you have 
work to do. And please don’t continue 
to disrespect us by saying that every-
thing is okay. In your world it may be, 
but today we can correct that. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I have never 
said everything is perfectly okay. I 
said this bill is not the answer to what 
issues may still exist out there. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS), and applaud her for how she 
has handled herself in the past few 
months through all the turmoil and all 
of the challenges she has had. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses opposing H.R. 7. 
NFIB, 
Washington, DC, March 24, 2021. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Education and 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: On behalf of NFIB, the nation’s 
leading small business advocacy organiza-
tion, I write in opposition to H.R. 7, the Pay-
check Fairness Act. This legislation will add 
significant burdens to small businesses and 
potentially expose them to frivolous law-
suits. 
NFIB and its members believe in equal pay 
for equal work. However, NFIB does not be-
lieve that this legislation is the solution. 
H.R. 7 will make legitimate business-related 
pay differences difficult to defend in court, 
invite frivolous lawsuits against small busi-
ness owners by allowing unlimited compen-
satory and punitive damages in equal pay 
lawsuits, and significantly increase small 
business paperwork burdens. 
This legislation would make it nearly im-
possible for a small employer to defend 
against claims where an ‘‘alternative em-
ployment practice’’ exists and could serve 
the same business purpose without producing 
a wage differential. Even if an employer were 
to demonstrate that a legitimate factor such 
as education, training, or experience ac-
counted for a wage differential, an employee 
could claim that an ‘‘alternative employ-
ment practice’’ existed and that the em-
ployer refused to adopt such a practice. For 
example, an employee of a small, local hard-
ware store would be able to sue an employer 
for refusing to adopt a business practice that 
a much larger company uses to address wage 
discrepancies. Forcing one-size-fits-all legis-
lation on small, independent businesses puts 
them at a significant disadvantage relative 
to their larger competitors. A small business 
may have legitimate reasons for not adopt-
ing the practices of a large business. How-
ever, if an employee can prove that the inde-
pendent business refused to adopt the ‘‘alter-
native employment practice’’ of a large com-
petitor, the small business automatically 
loses the suit. 
This legislation also prohibits an employer 
from asking a prospective employee about 
wage history and prohibits an employer from 
relying on wage history in determining 
wages. These prohibitions create a very dif-
ficult situation for small business owners. A 
person’s written resume is only one aspect of 
the application process; a person’s salary 
history is another essential part of gauging 
professional growth and development. If the 
needs of a prospective employee and the 
wants of a business do not match, the pro-
spective employee and the business should be 
able to discern this sooner rather than later 
to avoid wasting each party’s time and en-
ergy. By eliminating salary history, the hir-
ing process becomes less precise and more 
difficult for small employers. 
This bill also puts significant paperwork 
burdens on small business owners. It requires 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission (EEOC) to issue regulations pro-
viding for the collection of employers’ com-
pensation data. Most small business owners 
do not have a human resources department 
or a full-time staff member in charge of re-
porting and compliance. NFIB members find 
unreasonable government regulations to be 
their sixth biggest problem and federal pa-
perwork to be their 15th biggest problem 
when ranking their top 75 problems and pri-
orities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1815 
April 15, 2021 
NFIB strongly opposes H.R. 7, the Pay-
check Fairness Act, urges the committee to 
oppose the legislation in its current form. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN KUHLMAN, 
Vice President, 
Federal Government Relations. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to be able to introduce 
this as a small business owner myself. 
The NFIB letter says: H.R. 7 will add 
significant burdens to small businesses 
and potentially expose them to frivo-
lous lawsuits. In addition, the bill will 
make legitimate business-related pay 
differences difficult to defend in court, 
invite frivolous lawsuits against small 
business owners by allowing unlimited 
compensatory and punitive damages in 
equal pay lawsuits, and significantly 
increase small business paperwork bur-
dens. 
Moreover, the NFIB letter says that 
H.R. 7 will make it nearly impossible 
for a small employer to defend against 
claims where an alternative employ-
ment practice exists and could serve 
the same business purpose without pro-
ducing the wage differential. 
The letter also highlights the signifi-
cant paperwork burdens H.R. 7 would 
place on small businesses who do not 
have a human resources department, a 
full-time staff member in charge, or at-
torneys for reporting and compliance. 
Mr. Speaker, having been a small 
business owner and supported by the 
small business owners, and during the 
pandemic when it is so necessary for us 
to get our small businesses up and op-
erating, I urge my colleagues to take 
these views of small business owners 
into consideration before they vote on 
H.R. 7. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
not just about the past, it is about the 
future. Gender-based wage discrimina-
tion exists in every State and in many 
industries. 
In the tech industry, which has a 
huge presence in my district in North 
Carolina’s Research Triangle, women 
typically make thousands of dollars 
less than men in the same roles. 
Unsurprisingly, women in tech often 
leave the industry due to unfair com-
pensation, much to that industry’s det-
riment. 
Pay inequity also follows women into 
retirement. Women have, on average, 
only 70 percent of the retirement in-
come men have. 
One of the best ways we can help 
close the wage gap is through salary 
negotiation training, which is one of 
the key provisions of this bill. 
I am thankful to groups like Ladies 
Get Paid and countless others working 
to empower women to help them advo-
cate for their work. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill for the sake of future generations. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
this letter from the National Council of 
Jewish Women. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN, 
Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our 
180,000 members, advocates, and supporters, 
National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) 
urges you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act 
(H.R. 7) without amendments that limit its 
scope or undermine its critical protections. 
NCJW is a grassroots organization of vol-
unteers and advocates who turn progressive 
ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, 
NCJW strives for social justice by improving 
the quality of life for women, children, and 
families and by safeguarding individual 
rights and freedoms. The Torah compels us 
tzedek, tzedek tirdof—to pursue justice. To 
that end, we advocate for employment laws, 
policies, and practices that provide equal pay 
and benefits for work of comparable worth 
and equal opportunities for advancement. 
Nearly 60 years after passage of the land-
mark Equal Pay Act, the gender way gap 
persists. Overall, women earn only 82 cents 
for every dollar earned by men, and the gap 
is much wider for women of color (Black 
women earn 63 cents, Indigenous women earn 
60 cents, Latinas earn 55 cents, and some 
Asian American and Pacific Islander women 
earn only 52 cents). Earnings lost to these 
gaps are exacerbating the financial effects of 
COVID–19, falling particularly heavily on 
women of color and the families who depend 
on their income. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has 
been passed three previous times by the 
House of Representatives, mostly recently in 
the 116th Congress, offers a much needed up-
date to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by pro-
viding new tools to battle pervasive pay gaps 
and to challenge discrimination. 
We cannot build back an economy that 
works for everyone without ensuring that all 
women can work with equality, safety, and 
dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing 
the Paycheck Fairness Act would mark a vi-
tally important step toward ensuring this 
becomes reality. I ask you to vote YES on 
the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) without 
amendments that limit its scope or under-
mine its critical protections. 
Sincerely, 
JODY RABHAN, 
Chief Policy Officer, 
National Council of Jewish Women. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
YWCA USA, I include in the RECORD a 
letter of support for H.R. 7. 
YWCA, 
April 13, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of YWCA 
USA, a network of over 200 local associations 
in 45 states and the District of Columbia, I 
write today to urge the Representative to 
support the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) 
and vote no on harmful amendments. As the 
economy continues to struggle under the 
weight of the COVID–19 pandemic dispropor-
tionately affecting women and marginalized 
communities, there is no better time to take 
action to improve the economic security of 
women and families and strengthen our 
economy. I urge you to pass this bill without 
amendments that limit its scope or under-
mines its critical protections. 
For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a 
mission 
to 
eliminate 
racism, 
empower 
women, and promote peace, justice, freedom, 
and dignity for all. From our earliest days 
providing skills and housing support to 
women entering the workforce in the 1850s, 
YWCA has been at the forefront of the most 
pressing 
social 
movements—from 
voting 
rights to civil rights, from affordable hous-
ing to pay equity, from violence prevention 
to health care reform. Today, we serve over 
2 million women, girls and family members 
of all ages and backgrounds in more than 
1,200 communities each year. 
Informed by our extensive history, the ex-
pertise of our nationwide network, and our 
collective commitment to advocating for the 
equity of women and families, we believe 
that no one should have to choose between 
their livelihoods and their health, family, or 
safety. Yet far too women and families, in-
cluding a disproportionate number of women 
and families of color, must make this choice 
every day. This has become more clear as the 
effects of the COVID–19 pandemic become 
more transparent. The impact of the pan-
demic has fallen heavily on women and 
women of color. Women are especially likely 
to be essential workers, but they are also 
bearing the brunt of job losses, while shoul-
dering increased caregiving responsibilities 
that have pushed millions out of the work-
force entirely, resulting in an economic 
‘‘Shesession’’. Black women, Latinas, and 
other women of color are especially likely to 
be on the front lines of the crisis, risking 
their lives in jobs in health care, child care, 
and grocery stores, all while being paid less 
than their male counterparts. 
The bipartisan Paycheck Fairness Act 
(H.R. 7) would help close longstanding gender 
and racial wage gaps by updating and 
strengthening the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and 
ensure robust protections against sex-based 
pay 
discrimination. 
Today, 
on 
average, 
women in the United States earn only 82 
cents for every dollar paid to men, amount-
ing to an annual gender wage gap of $10,157. 
Unfortunately, this gap is worse for women 
of color. Among women who hold full-time, 
year-round jobs in the United States, Black 
women are typically paid 63 cents, Native 
American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 
cents for every dollar paid to white, non-His-
panic men. White, non-Hispanic women are 
paid 79 cents and Asian American women 87 
cents for every dollar paid to white, non-His-
panic men, and Asian American and Pacific 
Islander women of some ethnic and national 
backgrounds fare much worse. The COVID–19 
global pandemic has exposed deepening eco-
nomic disparities, further unveiling how the 
work performed primarily by women, and 
particularly women of color, has long been 
and continues to be undervalued and under-
paid. It is time Congress addressed these 
deepening disparities and take steps towards 
real economic change for women by passing 
the Paycheck Fairness Act. We cannot afford 
to shortchange women as a result of per-
sistent gender pay gaps and we urge the Rep-
resentative to pass this bill without delay. 
YWCA USA urges the Representative to 
protect women’s economic security and pass 
the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and take 
critical steps towards strengthening wom-
en’s economic security, particularly at a 
time when the country begins to recover 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. At this pivotal 
moment, Congress must take aggressive ac-
tion to address the economic disparities dis-
proportionately affecting women and women 
of color. We urge you to pass the Paycheck 
Fairness Act (H.R. 7) without harmful 
amendments that weaken its critical protec-
tions. 
Thank you for your time and consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
ELISHA RHODES, 
Interim CEO & Chief Operating Officer. 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise in full support of H.R. 7, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1816 
April 15, 2021 
As a nurse, I earned around 60 per-
cent of what my White male counter-
parts in the same position earned. I 
have often imagined how many people 
in my district experienced the same 
burdens, like how much overtime and 
missing wages we could have accrued 
every single month. 
We have been chronically underpaid 
and chronically undervalued. I have 
stood up to fight for underpaid nurses 
before and I stand here today to fight 
for 
underpaid 
women, 
especially 
women of color everywhere. 
Pay Black, pay Brown, pay indige-
nous, pay AAPI women what we’re 
worth. Run us our money and run us 
our money now. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT for leading and for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Paycheck Fairness Act. 
It has been more than five decades 
since the passage of the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963, yet a woman still earns only 82 
cents on average for every dollar 
earned 
by 
her 
male 
counterpart. 
Women of color fare much worse. The 
Paycheck Fairness Act will ensure 
equal pay for equal work. It is just that 
simple and it is just that overdue. Gen-
der and racial pay gaps persist, and 
earnings lost to these gaps are felt 
even more during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. This falls most heavily on 
women. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act will up-
date and strengthen the Equal Pay Act 
to help close this gap. Pay inequities 
not only affect women, it affects chil-
dren and their families. Though we 
have made strides in the past, we know 
the issue of equal pay persists. 
We must not pass this inequity on. I 
want my granddaughters, Aubrey and 
Ella, as well as my grandson, Sawyer, 
to live in a country where equal pay for 
equal work is the norm. 
I thank chairwoman and champion 
ROSA DELAURO. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, did you 
know that over 40 percent of mothers 
are sole or primary breadwinners for 
their families? It has been over 50 years 
since the Equal Pay Act was signed 
into law, yet the problems that pre-
ceded that legislation remain today. So 
it is time for the Paycheck Fairness 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, across the country, 
women are paid 80 cents to the dollar 
that men are paid, and the number is 
significantly lower for women of color. 
Black women make roughly 60 percent 
to the dollar. Native-American women 
make about 57 cents. And Latina 
women make just over 50 to the dollar. 
The discriminatory wage gap is cost-
ing women thousands of dollars a year 
for doing the exact same work as their 
male counterparts. And I see this right 
here in my community and my district 
where women are forced to work longer 
hours, harder, just to make ends meet 
and put food on the table for their fam-
ilies. 
My community is one of the poorest 
in the Nation, and the wage gap is one 
of the biggest factors for families who 
are really trying to get out of the cycle 
of poverty and get the support for their 
children so they can thrive. 
I am grateful to my colleagues on the 
Committee on Education and Labor for 
bringing this long overdue legislation. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia and 
thank him for his leadership—also, the 
Speaker and the ranking member. 
According to the National Women’s 
Law Center, based on today’s wage gap, 
a woman who works full-time year- 
round would typically lose $406,280 over 
her 40-year career. This means a 
woman making the median national 
salary for women would have to work 
almost 9 years longer than her male 
counterpart. 
Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enact-
ment of the Equal Pay Act, full-time 
working women still earn 82 cents on 
average for every dollar a man earns, 
amounting to a yearly gap of almost 
$20,000. They, too, raise children. They, 
too, have overhead. 
In this pandemic year, we have found 
that 2 million women have lost their 
jobs. We know that Hispanic women 
earn 55 cents, Native-American women 
60 cents, and African-American women, 
on average, only 63 cents. 
It is time now to put this paycheck 
fairness bill on the desk of the Presi-
dent of the United States. It modern-
izes and strengthens the Equal Pay 
Act, which is what the Lilly Ledbetter 
Act was, and brings the country one 
step closer to ensuring that women can 
receive equal pay for equal work. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and a member of the Democratic Working 
Women’s Task Force, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7, the landmark Paycheck Fairness 
Act, which strengthens and closes loopholes 
in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, including providing 
effective remedies for workers who are not 
being paid equal pay for equal work. 
I thank my colleague, the Chair of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, Congresswoman 
DELAURO, for introducing the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act in every Congress since 1997, which 
enabled me join her as an original cosponsor 
all during those years as we fought shoulder 
to shoulder for women’s equality and em-
powerment. 
Mr. Speaker, in January 2009, the Demo-
cratic-led 111th Congress sent to the Presi-
dent’s desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 
the first bill signed into law by President 
Obama, which restored the critical rights of 
workers to challenge unfair pay in court. 
Now, a Democratic-led House will push for 
enactment of another critical fair pay bill—the 
Paycheck Fairness Act that strengthens cur-
rent law. 
When House has been controlled by a 
Democratic majority, the Paycheck Fairness 
Act has passed several times—including in the 
110th Congress, the 111th Congress, and the 
116th Congress, when it passed by a bipar-
tisan vote of 242 to 187 on March 27, 2019, 
before dying in then-Senate Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL’S legislative graveyard. 
This is the year to finish the job and send 
this critical legislation all the to President 
Biden’s desk for signature. 
Mr. Speaker, as every woman Member of 
Congress knows, as our mother, sisters, 
daughters, and sorors in the workplace know 
all too well, the impact of the wage gap grows 
throughout a woman’s career. 
According to the National Women’s Law 
Center, based on today’s wage gap, a woman 
who worked full-time, year-round would typi-
cally lose $406,280 over a 40-year career. 
This means a woman making the median 
national salary for women would have to work 
almost nine years longer than her male coun-
terpart to make up this lifetime wage gap. 
Mr. Speaker, 58 years after the enactment 
of the Equal Pay Act, full-time working women 
still earn just 82 cents, on average, for every 
dollar a man earns, amounting to a yearly gap 
of $10,157 between full-time working men and 
women. 
The wage gap is also even larger for 
women of color. 
Hispanic women on average earn only 55 
cents for every dollar paid to white, non-His-
panic men. 
Native American women on average earn 
only 60 cents for every dollar paid to white, 
non-Hispanic men. 
African American women on average earn 
only 63 cents for every dollar paid to white, 
non-Hispanic men. 
The National Partnership for Women and 
Families has calculated that $10,157 for a me-
dian family in America means more than 9 ad-
ditional months of rent or 13 additional months 
of childcare. 
Indeed, if women were paid the same as 
men, the poverty rate for all working women 
would be cut in half and the poverty rate for 
working single mothers would be cut by nearly 
half. 
Because of loopholes in the law and weak 
sanctions for violations, the Equal Pay Act of 
1963 has not provided the tools to truly com-
bat unequal pay. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act modernizes and 
strengthens the Equal Pay Act and brings the 
country one step closer to ensuring that 
women receive equal pay for equal work in 
the following ways: 
1. Requires employers to prove that pay dis-
parities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons 
and puts the burden on employers to show the 
disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and 
necessary; 
2. Bans retaliation against workers who vol-
untarily discuss or disclose their wages; 
3. Ensures women receive the same robust 
remedies for sex-based pay discrimination 
available to those subjected to discrimination 
based on race and national origin;

4. Removes obstacles in the Equal Pay Act 
to facilitate a wronged worker’s participation in 
class action lawsuits that challenge systemic 
pay discrimination; 
5. Makes improvements in the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC’s) 
and the Department of Labor’s tools for en-
forcing the Equal Pay Act; 
6. Provides assistance to all businesses to 
help them with their equal pay practices, rec-
ognizes excellence in pay practices by busi-
nesses, and empowers women and girls by 
creating a negotiation skills training program; 
and 
7. Prohibits employers from seeking salary 
history in determining future pay, so that pay 
discrimination does not follow women from job 
to job. 
Finally, equal pay is not simply a women’s 
issue, but a family issue. 
Two-thirds of mothers are either the sole 
breadwinner or a co-breadwinner in the 
household, so their earnings are vital to their 
families. 
When women bring home less money each 
day, it means they have less for the everyday 
needs 
of 
their 
families—groceries, 
rent, 
childcare, and doctors’ visits. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is strongly en-
dorsed by a coalition of more than 200 organi-
zations, including AAUW, National Women’s 
Law Center, National Partnership for Women 
and 
Families, 
National 
Organization 
for 
Women, National Committee on Pay Equity, 
MomsRising, UltraViolet, Center for Law and 
Social Policy, The Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, League of

Commerce, AFL–CIO, SEIU, United Steel-
workers, AFSCME, American Federation of 
Teachers, National Education Association, 
International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, American Psychological 
Association, Anti-Defamation League, and 
many more. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act of 
2021, to ensure effective remedies for workers 
who are not being paid equal pay for equal 
work. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I am prepared to close, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. Women, in 
terms of employment and pay, have 
made great strides in this country. 
When I was graduating from high 
school, basically there were three open 
professions for women: nursing, teach-
ing, and being a secretary. We have 
come a long way. We have also come a 
long way in terms of wages. 
Do we have ways to go in this coun-
try in terms of the way everybody 
thinks about people who are different 
from them? We certainly do. Repub-
licans and Democrats both agree that 
pay discrimination is repugnant and il-
legal. I will say it again and again. It 
is repugnant and illegal. 
Despite misguided claims from the 
other side, this underlying principle is 
not up for debate. Women should not be 
paid less than men for equal work. 
However, Republicans are not in the 
business of passing radical and pre-
scriptive bills just to get flashy head-
lines and score cheap political points. 
We are equally committed to pro-
moting both fairness and strong policy-
making, and when judged by these 
standards, today’s bill falls woefully 
short. Pay discrimination is illegal. 
You know, we have really heard 
nothing about the inadequacies of the 
current law or the current processes. 
What we have heard is that we need 
new legislation. Republicans disagree 
with that. Again, we want pay dis-
crimination to be illegal and we want 
any such cases to be treated seriously 
and to be looked at. This bill offers no 
new protection against pay discrimina-
tion in the workplace, however. And 
that is sorely lacking in this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7 is nothing more 
than a trial lawyer payout at the ex-
pense of hardworking women. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time to 
secure equal pay for equal work. Over 
the past year, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has driven over 2 million women out of 
the workforce. As women return to the 
workplace, failure to strengthen the 
equal pay protections will exacerbate 
and entrench the gender wage gap for 
years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, we all know that dis-
crimination exists. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act will allow victims the tools 
they need to combat and also close 
loopholes that allows employers to es-
cape liability for discriminatory pay 
differences. 
Today, we are talking about financial 
security for millions of families. Sixty- 
four percent of mothers are either the 
sole family breadwinner or co-bread-
winner. We cannot continue to allow 
gender-based pay inequity to rob half 
of all workers and their families the 
wages they deserve. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act is our 
chance to finally help close the gender 
wage gap by reinforcing the Equal Pay 
Act and strengthening protections for 
working women. The bill would ensure 
that gender equality on the job is not 
an aspiration but a reality. 
Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues 
to support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
I have strongly supported the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act and have done so for over two dec-
ades. 
When the legislation finally got a vote in the 
House in 2008, I voted ‘‘yes’’ I voted ‘‘yes’’ 
again in 2009 and 2019. I have cosponsored 
the Paycheck Fairness Act since 2015. 
In January, I again enthusiastically cospon-
sored H.R. 7—the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
In late March, however, H.R. 7 was radically 
altered during markup in the Education and 
Labor Committee with a new definition of 
‘‘sex’’ that according to serious legal analysis 
will compel employers to subsidize abortion on 
demand. 
Because I respect the inherent dignity and 
value of unborn baby girls and boys who will 
be put at grave risk of death by dismember-
ment abortion and chemical poisoning if H.R 7 
is enacted in its current form, I will vote ‘‘no’’ 
today. 
In a letter dated April 14, the United States 
Conference of Catholic Bishops said: ‘‘H.R. 7 
would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA). The FLSA, among other things, pro-
hibits unequal wages between men and 
women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C. 
§ 206(d)(l). Wages include all forms of remu-
neration, including ‘‘frinqe benefits’’ such as 
‘‘medical, hospital, [and] accident . . . insur-
ance,’’ ‘‘life insurance,’’ ‘‘retirement benefits,’’ 
and ‘‘leave.’’ 29 C.F.R. 1620.10, 1620.11. 
‘‘Strengthening federal law to ensure equal 
compensation for equal work as between men 
and women is a laudable legislative goal, and 
we heartily endorse that goal . . . Unfortu-
nately, H.R. 7 has moved in a different direc-
tion . . . We believe that if the bill were to 
pass, the Fair Labor Standards Act could be 
construed to require employers, including even 
religious organizations, to cover and pay for 
abortions . . . we urge members to oppose 
the redefinition of sex in H.R. 7 and instead 
revert to the version of the bill that passed the 
House in the 116th Congress.’’ 
The National Right to Life Committee op-
posed the redefinition of ‘‘sex’’ and opposes 
the bill. They said in a letter: ‘‘H.R. 7 makes 
definitional changes to sex to include preg-
nancy, childbirth, or a related medical condi-
tion. It is well established that abortion will be 
regarded as a ‘‘related medical condition.’’ 
See 29C.F.R.pt.1604 App.(1986) and Doe v. 
CARS Protection Plus, lnc., 527F.3d 358 
(3dCir.2008). 
‘‘Historically, when Congress has addressed 
discrimination based on sex, rules of construc-
tion have been added to prevent requiring 
funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of 
construction that would make this legislation 
abortion-neutral, it is likely that H.R. 7 could 
be used to sue employers for a lack of elec-
tive abortion coverage.’’ 
In like manner, the Susan B. Anthony List 
opposes the bill noting that H.R. 7 amends the 
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by adding 
‘‘pregnancy childbirth, or a related medical 
condition’’ to the definition of ‘‘sex,’’ which 
courts have interpreted broadly to include 
abortion.’’ 
Other pro-life organizations urged a ‘‘no’’ 
vote including March for Life Action. 
Madam Speaker, underscoring my commit-
ment to the legislation without the redefinition 
of the term ‘‘sex’’, yesterday I introduced H.R 
2490—the Paycheck Fairness Act with the 
identical H.R. 7 language from January. 
H.R. 2490 is needed to ensure that the 
noble goals embedded in the landmark law, 
the Equal Pay Act of 1963, are achieved. 
Among its provisions H.R. 2490: 
Prohibits employers from seeking the salary 
history of prospective employees. By banning 
reliance on salary history in determining future 
pay, the bill ensures that prior pay discrimina-
tion doesn’t follow workers from job to job. 
Bans retaliation against workers who dis-
cuss their wages. 
Improves research on the gender pay gap. 
The bill instructs DOL to conduct studies and 
review available research and data to provide 
information on how to identify, correct, and 
eliminate illegal wage disparities. 
Requires the collection of wage data from 
federal contractors and directs the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to

UNITED STATES CONFERENCE 
OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS, 
Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We write to raise 
pro-life and other concerns about the Pay-
check Fairness Act, H.R. 7. 
H.R. 7 would amend the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act. The FLSA, among other things, 
prohibits unequal wages between men and 
women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C. 
§ 206(d)(l). Wages include all forms of remu-
neration, including ‘‘fringe benefits’’ such as 
‘‘medical, hospital, [and] accident . . . insur-
ance,’’ ‘‘life insurance,’’ ‘‘retirement bene-
fits,’’ and ‘‘leave.’’ 29 C.F.R. §§ 1620.10, 1620.11. 
Strengthening federal law to ensure equal 
compensation for equal work as between men 
and women is a laudable legislative goal, and 
we heartily endorse that goal. See Economic 
Justice for All, no. 167 (1986), (‘‘Particular at-
tention is needed to achieve pay equity be-
tween men and women’’); Compendium of the 
Social Doctrine of the Church, no. 295 (2004) 
(‘‘An urgent need to recognize effectively the 
rights of women in the workplace is seen es-
pecially under the aspects of pay, insurance 
and social security.’’); Pope Francis, Audi-
ence with Delegates from the Confederation 
of Trade Unions in Italy (June 28, 2017) (‘‘And 
what I am about to say may seem obvious, 
but in the world of work women are still in 
second class. You might say, ‘No, but there 
is that businesswoman, that other one . . .’; 
yes, but if women earn less, are more easily 
exploited . . . do something.’’). Indeed, Con-
gress could do more in this area. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 7 has moved in a dif-
ferent direction. On March 24, the House 
Committee on Education and Labor marked 
up the bill to redefine the term .. ‘‘sex’’ to 
include such items as ‘‘sex stereotypes,’’ 
‘‘pregnancy, child birth, or a related medical 
condition,’’ ‘‘sexual orientation.’’ ‘‘gender 
identity,’’ and ‘‘sex characteristics. includ-
ing intersex traits.’’ 
H.R. 7’s redefinition of sex in the FLSA is 
seriously problematic. We believe that if the 
bill were to pass, the FLSA could be con-
strued to require employers, including even 
religious organizations, to (a) cover and pay 
for abortions, contraceptives, and gender 
transition procedures in their health plans 
(b) treat same-sex civil marriages as equiva-
lent to traditional marriages in the provi-
sion of spousal benefits, and (c) facilitate 
abortions and gender transition procedures 
by providing paid leave for that purpose as 
part of existing paid leave programs. In this 
way, the bill would require many religious 
organizations to be involved in and to ap-
prove things they sincerely believe are 
wrong. 
Some may argue that Title VII already im-
poses all or some of these requirements. 
That argument—in addition to rendering the 
redefinition of ‘‘sex’’ in this bill seemingly 
redundant in whole or in part—overlooks the 
fact that Title VII has religious exemptions 
and abortion-neutral language that are not 
found in the FLSA. The Supreme Court has 
put off to another day the resolution of the 
question of exactly how the sex discrimina-
tion provisions of Title VII intersect with 
the 
religious 
convictions 
of 
employers. 
Bostock v. Clayton County. 140 S. Ct. 1731, 
1753–54 (2020). H.R. 7 would raise a similar 
question but in a different statutory setting, 
one in which the critical religious exemp-
tions and abortion-neutral language of Title 
VII are entirely missing. 
For these reasons, we urge members to op-
pose the redefinition of sex in H.R. 7 and in-
stead revert to the version of the bill that 
passed the House in the 116th Congress. 
Sincerely.

NATIONAL RIGHT TO 
LIFE COMMITTEE, INC., 
Alexandria, VA, April 13, 2021. 
Re In Opposition to the Paycheck Fairness 
Act (H.R. 7). 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: This week, the 
House will consider the Paycheck Fairness 
Act (H.R. 7). While the legislation is meant 
to address potential discrimination regard-
ing the gender pay gap, the legislation was 
amended to contain language that could be 
construed to require employers to cover elec-
tive abortion in their healthcare benefits. 
Because of this change, National Right to 
Life urges you to oppose the bill and reserves 
the right to include a House roll call on this 
measure in our scorecard of key pro-life 
votes of the 117th Congress. 
H.R. 7 states that it constitutes discrimi-
nation to provide disparate wages based on 
sex, and the legislation creates more oppor-
tunities to seek remedies for those chal-
lenging compensation. The Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has 
defined equal pay under the Fair Labor 
Standards Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
to include all forms of compensation, includ-
ing healthcare benefits. 
H.R. 7 makes definitional changes to ‘‘sex’’ 
to include ‘‘pregnancy, childbirth, or a re-
lated medical condition.’’ It is well estab-
lished that abortion will be regarded as a 
‘‘related medical condition.’’ See 29 C.F.R. 
pt. 1604 App. (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protec-
tion Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir. 2008). 
Historically, when Congress has addressed 
discrimination based on sex, rules of con-
struction have been added to prevent requir-
ing funding of abortion. Since there is no 
rule of construction that would make this 
legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that 
H.R. 7 could be used to sue employers for a 
lack of elective abortion coverage. 
Under H.R. 7, a person could make a claim 
that an employer’s failure to provide health 
coverage for abortion is discriminatory if an 
employer provides health coverage for male- 
specific items. 
For the reasons above, National Right to 
Life opposes the current version of H.R. 7 
and reserves the right to include a House roll 
call on this measure in our scorecard of key 
pro-life votes of the 117th Congress. 
Should you have any questions, please con-
tact us. 
Thank you for your consideration of 
NRLC’s position on this matter. 
Respectfully submitted, 
CAROL TOBIAS, 
President. 
DAVID N. O’STEEN, Ph.D., 
Executive Director. 
JENNIFER POPIK, J.D., 
Legislative Director. 
SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST, 
April 13, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I write to advise 
you that Susan B. Anthony List, on behalf of 
our more than 900,000 members, opposes H.R. 
7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was 
amended at the last minute to add a defini-
tion of sex that could force employers to 
cover elective abortion through employee 
benefits under the guise of fairness. 
H.R. 7 amends the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938 by adding ‘‘pregnancy, childbirth, 
or a related medical condition’’ to the defini-
tion of ‘‘sex,’’ which courts have interpreted 
broadly to include abortion. 
The abortion implications are buried in 
layers of court interpretations and regula-
tions of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC). The Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act (FSLA) prohibits sex discrimination 
in the area of employee wages. And while the 
FSLA does not explicitly include benefits 
like health coverage in its definition of 
wages, the EEOC has interpreted wages to 
include benefits. The EEOC states that the 
Equal Pay Act, part of the FSLA, ‘‘requires 
that men and women in the same workplace 
be given equal pay for equal work.’’ The De-
partment of Labor and the EEOC further 
stipulate that equal pay includes benefits, 
and the EEOC allows a person to go straight 
to court with claims this provision has been 
violated. There is nothing preventing a per-
son from claiming sex discrimination if an 
employer provides health coverage for all of 
men’s health services but does not pay for 
coverage for abortion services for women. 
When the terms ‘‘pregnancy, childbirth, or 
related medical condition’’ were used in the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act four decades 
ago, the terms were accompanied by lan-
guage stating that employers could not be 
forced to cover abortion in health insurance 
benefits except to save the life of the moth-
er. While H.R. 7 does not override that lim-
ited safeguard, it does fail to extend equiva-
lent safeguards to address its much broader, 
more sweeping reach. Without abortion neu-
tral language in H.R. 7, this legislation opens 
the door for employers to be sued for sex dis-
crimination by simply refraining from fund-
ing abortion on demand in employee health 
plans. 
Susan B. Anthony List opposes and will 
score against H.R. 7. 
Sincerely, 
MARJORIE DANNENFELSER, 
President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1819 
April 15, 2021 
MARCH FOR LIFE ACTION, 
Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of March 
for Life Action and the millions of pro-life 
Americans who march to end abortion, I am 
writing to voice our opposition to H.R. 7, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act. While March for Life 
Action has no position on the original bill, 
inexplicably the bill language was changed 
this Congress to include troubling language 
that seems to have the singular purpose of 
promoting abortion. 
The definition included in Section 2 in-
cludes ‘‘pregnancy or related medical condi-
tion,’’ which amends the Equal Pay Act por-
tion of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This 
law states that it constitutes discrimination 
to provide different wages to individuals 
based on sex. The EEOC defines equal pay 
under the FLSA/Equal Pay Act to mean all 
forms of compensation, including benefits. 
By stating that ‘‘sex’’ includes ‘‘pregnancy 
or related medical condition,’’ the bill estab-
lishes the expectation that women will be 
given ‘‘equal benefits’’ related to pregnancy 
and abortion. The legislation gives power to 
the Federal government to use its full force 
to attack health care providers, including 
businesses, which do not include full abor-
tion coverage in their plans, and be subject 
to the enhanced penalties laid out in the bill. 
Clearly this legislation is not about fair-
ness, however it is pushing a radical abortion 
scheme that is opposed by most Americans. 
For these reasons, March for Life Action will 
score against H.R. 7 in our annual scorecard 
for the 117th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
THOMAS MCCLUSKY, 
President, March for Life Action. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to express my support for the pas-
sage of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
This landmark legislation, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor, will close loopholes in the 
Equal Pay Act to better protect and promote 
effective remedies for workers still subject to 
inequitable and insufficient pay. 
Signed into law by President John F. Ken-
nedy in 1963, the Equal Pay Act was the first 
anti-discrimination law addressing wage dif-
ferences at the federal level. Now, half a cen-
tury after its enactment, women and minorities 
still face significant wage disparities despite 
making great strides in the workforce. Accord-
ing to a study conducted by the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s American Community Survey, the 
median earnings for women in Texas is $36k, 
compared to the median earnings of $46k for 
men. Across the Nation, women are only earn-
ing on average 82 cents for every dollar a 
man makes in similar, full-time positions. The 
differences are only exacerbated when you 
take into consideration that Black women 
make 63 cents, Native American women 60 
cents, and Hispanic women 55 cents. 
As the first Black woman elected in Dallas 
and someone who has worked in fields domi-
nated by men, I have witnessed and experi-
enced firsthand the biases and hardships that 
women and minorities face in our workforce. 
That is why I am proud to announce that the 
advances made in this legislation are wide- 
ranging and significant. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act will protect working women against 
retaliation for discussing salaries, prohibit em-
ployers from screening job applicants based 
on their salary history, and finally require em-
ployers to prove that pay disparities exist for 
legitimate, job-related reasons. Additionally, 
this effort will make improvements to the tools 
available to the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission and the Department of 
Labor to enforce the Equal Pay Act. 
Madam Speaker, as a member of the 
Democratic Women’s Caucus, I am committed 
to advancing the professional development 
and financial security of women and minorities 
in our workforce. That is why I would urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to sup-
port this legislation. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my support of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, a bill I’m proud to have voted for in 
the previous Congress. 
Today, women make up the majority of the 
college-educated workforce, yet only earn ap-
proximately 82 percent of what men earn. For 
women of color, the pay gap is even worse. 
This legislation is critical because it makes 
significant progress in eliminating pay discrimi-
nation against women by providing them the 
necessary protections and tools to combat 
sex-based pay discrimination. 
Simply put, ensuring that one half of the 
workforce is paid as much for the same job as 
the other half is a matter of basic rights and 
fairness. Women deserve better, and I look 
forward to voting for this bill once again.

forcement Task Force shall investigate chal-
lenges related to pay inequity pursuant to 
its mission in subsection (b), advance rec-
ommendations to address those challenges, 
and create action plans to implement the 
recommendations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 303, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, these amendments 
will: require the EEOC to provide for 
the collection of annual compensation 
data for employees disaggregated by 
race, sex, and national origin; add a re-
quirement that employers post notices 
and distribute information electroni-
cally informing employees of their 
rights under this act; direct the De-
partment of Labor establish a program 
to award grants to employers to engage 
in training and conduct self-audits to 
identify and reduce bias in pay prac-
tices; direct the Secretary of Labor to 
conduct a study and a research lit-
erature review of gender wage gap in 
the teenage workforce; and reestablish 
the National Equal Pay Equity Task 
Force that had been set up under the 
Obama administration to coordinate 
efforts between the Department of 
Labor, the Department of Justice, and 
the Office of Personnel Management. 
These amendments will make mean-
ingful improvements to the bill, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the en bloc 
amendments. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in opposition to the en bloc 
amendments. 
Madam Speaker, in America, dis-
criminating in pay based on sex is ille-
gal, as codified in the Equal Pay Act 
and the Civil Rights Act. 
Democrats claim H.R. 7 will improve 
upon these bipartisan laws to create 
new opportunities for women to fight 
pay discrimination. What H.R. 7 actu-
ally does is create new opportunities 
for trial lawyers to earn higher pay-
checks while offering no new protec-
tions for pay discrimination in the 
workplace. 
Unfortunately, I cannot support any 
of the Democrat amendments to H.R. 7 
because none of them addresses the nu-
merous unworkable and onerous provi-
sions in the bill. 
I 
appreciate 
that 
Representative 
BEYER’s amendment recognizes the 
very serious problems with H.R. 7 by 
attempting to place a fig leaf on the 
expansive government data collection 
mandate in the bill. However, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, EEOC, is still required to im-
plement the draconian data collection 
scheme in the underlying bill, which is 
still extremely misguided, expensive, 
and unnecessary. 
H.R. 7 requires business owners to 
submit reams of pay data to the EEOC 
disaggregated by job category, race, 
sex, and ethnicity. Moreover, the col-
lection mandate also includes other 
employment-related 
data, 
including 
hiring, termination, and promotion 
data, which even the discredited 2016 
Obama administration pay data collec-
tion scheme did not include. 
The data collection mandate in H.R. 
7 raises several concerns. 
First, it puts at risk volumes of high-
ly confidential pay data involving mil-
lions of individual workers. We all 
know of the widespread data breaches 
the Federal Government has suffered. 
Second, EEOC will not be able to 
manage or properly use this data. It 
has never been explained what exactly 
the EEOC will do with this data. 
Madam Speaker, data is not the same 
as information. 
Third, this mandate is overly burden-
some. Under the Obama administration 
scheme, the data cells required from 
business owners when they file an Em-
ployer 
Information 
Report, 
EEO–1, 
with EEOC expanded 180 cells to 3,660. 
Let me say that again: from 180 cells to 
3,660. H.R. 7’s scheme will add on hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of more data 
cells. 
EEOC has estimated that with the 
new reams of pay data added, the col-
lection will cost business owners more 
than $600 million annually. I doubt 
that is going to help one single woman 
in this country. 
Although this amendment purports 
to give EEOC more discretion to imple-
ment the pay data collection, this data 
collection mandate should simply be 
removed from the bill. 
In any event, discretion cuts both 
ways, and the Democrat-controlled 
EEOC may choose to implement a data 
collection scheme even more expan-
sive. 
Let me be clear that the Beyer 
amendment does not improve the dra-
conian pay data collection mandate in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1821 
April 15, 2021 
the underlying bill or the other serious 
flaws in other sections of H.R. 7 we 
have talked about today. 
Representative 
NEWMAN’s 
amend-
ment takes a longstanding reasonable 
requirement and makes it disruptive 
and unworkable. 
First, the amendment requires a 
workplace notice posting of a partisan 
special-interest bill which fails to ad-
dress pay discrimination in the work-
place. 
Second, under current law, covered 
employers must post a notice of the 
equal employment opportunity rights 
in a conspicuous place at the work-
place. Employees who telecommute or 
otherwise do not have access to the 
physical notice must be provided an 
electronic version. Under Representa-
tive NEWMAN’s amendment, the em-
ployer must post electronic copies of a 
new notice on an internal website to 
which employees have access. This is 
unrealistic. H.R. 7 applies to millions 
of small businesses that do not have 
websites, much less internal websites 
for their employees. 
In keep with the other impractical 
provisions in H.R. 7, the amendment 
adds another onerous requirement on 
small businesses that will be stuck 
with the bill. 
Representative 
OCASIO-CORTEZ’ 
amendment would create a new pro-
gram for the Department of Labor to— 
I hate to say this word—‘‘train’’ em-
ployers regarding bias in negotiation 
and other wage-setting practices. The 
amendment includes a non-exhaustive 
list of 13 wage-setting practices on 
which employers allegedly need edu-
cation. Employers may understandably 
review this list as 13 new ways for trial 
lawyers to allege violations of the 
Equal Pay Act. 
I will compliment one aspect of Rep-
resentative 
OCASIO-CORTEZ’ 
amend-
ment. It mentions compensation self- 
audits. Republicans agree that self-au-
dits can be a useful tool in combating 
pay discrimination, and we urge sup-
port for the Republican substitute 
amendment which encourages employ-
ers to conduct self-evaluations to iden-
tify 
potentially 
unlawful 
pay 
dif-
ferences and to take steps to rectify 
any unlawful pay practices. Unfortu-
nately, H.R. 7 does not encourage these 
self-evaluations. 
Representative 
WILLIAMS’ 
amend-
ment reestablishes the Obama-era Na-
tional Equal Pay Enforcement Task 
Force. This amendment would estab-
lish another politically biased govern-
ment bureaucracy that includes agen-
cies such as the EEOC and the Depart-
ment of Labor already tasked with en-
forcing laws against pay discrimina-
tion and ensuring compliance with 
those laws. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
my amendment to H.R. 7. 
I was privileged to serve on the 
Science Committee and study physics 
as an undergraduate, and I have always 
been impressed with the Heisenberg un-
certainty principle. It says you can’t 
measure something without changing 
it. 
As a longtime businessman, we al-
ways wanted to be driven by data be-
cause you can’t manage what you don’t 
measure. 
Receiving equal pay should not have 
to depend on an anonymous note writer 
letting you know that you are being 
underpaid. Guaranteeing that women 
and men receive equal pay for equal 
work is a principle rooted in our Na-
tion’s commitment to equality and 
fairness. 
My amendment would require em-
ployers to report pay data by race, na-
tional origin, and gender to the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission 
and for that data to be shared with the 
Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs. 
It would lengthen the timeframe for 
inception of the pay data collection 
from 18 to 24 months, providing the 
EEOC with more time to develop and 
execute an effective pay data collec-
tion. 
I believe it is plausible, Madam 
Speaker, to say that more than 90 per-
cent of paychecks are prepared by soft-
ware, either internal or external. I re-
member preparing paychecks by hand, 
but it is a very small business that 
does that anymore. That software will 
evolve overnight, probably through the 
course of this debate, and the burden is 
likely to be small. 
The amendment also permits, but 
doesn’t require, the use of pay bands or 
hours-worked data and provides the 
EEOC with flexibility in what type of 
compensation 
data 
to 
use. 
Impor-
tantly, it also gives the EEOC the dis-
cretion to collect additional employ-
ment-related data but also to consider 
employer burden, data format, and con-
fidentiality. 
Pay data reporting by employers 
promises to shine light on race and 
gender pay disparities, increase the 
likelihood of employer self-analysis 
and self-correction, and identify the 
areas of concern for further investiga-
tion by enforcement agencies. 
Reporting this data will also allow 
the EEOC to see which employers have 
racial or gender pay gaps that differ 
significantly from the pay patterns 
from other employers in their industry 
and region. 
I can also say, after almost 50 years 
of adapting to Federal regulations, al-
most every business can find a way to 
profit from it. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have two additional speak-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Ms. FOXX for her com-
ments, and I will share a tip because I 
am a former small business owner. So, 
there is this great thing called commu-
nication. You can chat with one an-
other and talk about some of their 
rights, so I recommend it for all that 
ask. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of 
the millions of women in the workforce 
that to this day are still only making 
82 cents on every dollar. My amazing 
colleagues have identified lots of stats 
that are very, very convincing with 
strong data. 
I ask today that everyone consider 
the 15 to 20 percent of the female work-
force 
who 
have 
either 
paused 
or 
stopped their careers—or ruined their 
careers, which many would say—be-
cause of the pandemic. It has been dev-
astating, as we all know. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on 
the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by making it 
harder for employers to pay women 
less than men for the same work. 
When woman return to the work-
force, and I pray that they do, we must 
ensure that they are aware of their 
rights 
under 
legislation—verbally, 
electronically, by any means; it all 
works—which is why I have introduced 
an amendment that requires employers 
to display a poster in their workplace 
or their employment worksite, or by 
email, or whatever they can do, so 
workers clearly understand that they 
have rights under this act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this amendment and 
this legislation so we can ensure equal 
work means equal pay. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1415 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Paycheck Fairness Act and my amend-
ment to this bill. 
On average, full-time working women 
need to work well into the next year to 
catch up to the salary our male coun-
terparts earned the previous year. 
March 24 marked the day that women’s 
salaries, on average, caught up to the 
salaries of our male counterparts in 
2020. For several subgroups of women, 
this date won’t come until later this 
year. For example, as a Black woman, 
it will take until August—an addi-
tional 8 months—to make the same sal-
ary of our male counterparts as they 
did in 2020. 
The American people look to Con-
gress to be a force for economic justice 
and create policies that are fair and 
just. It is simply wrong that in the 21st 
century women still face pay inequity. 
That is why I am proud to support the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, which will 
strengthen existing laws to ensure that 
women are getting the pay that they 
deserve.

H1822 
April 15, 2021 
My amendment will build on this 
crucial legislation by reestablishing 
the 
Equal 
Pay 
Enforcement 
Task 
Force. This task force, which pre-
viously existed during the Obama- 
Biden administration, will ensure Fed-
eral agencies are working together to 
limit any potential gaps in enforce-
ment of equal pay laws. Putting this 
task force back in place will bring us 
one step closer to ensuring that women 
finally receive equal pay for equal 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
the bill before us today to ensure that 
women are paid fairly. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I hope we would adopt these 
three good amendments en bloc, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port equal pay for equal work. I don’t 
know how many times Republicans 
have to say that, but we will keep say-
ing it if necessary because equal pay 
for equal work is the right thing to do, 
but it is also required under two Fed-
eral statutes, and in most cases it is 
being adhered to. 
Congress should focus on policies 
that will continue to increase eco-
nomic opportunity and expand options 
for all workers. That is what we should 
be doing in the Education and Labor 
Committee: looking for ways to in-
crease economic opportunity and ex-
pand options for all workers. 
We shouldn’t be doing away with 
pipeline jobs, we shouldn’t be raising 
taxes, and we shouldn’t be decreasing 
options for people to work in this coun-
try; but that is what this administra-
tion is doing, and that is what the 
other side is doing. 
The Democrat amendments and the 
underlying bill fail miserably in terms 
of increasing options and expanding 
economic opportunity. It is pushing 
people into the bands, making every-
body the same and treating everybody 
as though they have no individuality, 
they shouldn’t be innovative, they 
shouldn’t 
be 
creative, 
and 
they 
shouldn’t strive for more. That is not 
the way to go. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the Democrat en bloc 
amendment and the underlying bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 303, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Virginia. 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MRS. MILLER- 
MEEKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 4 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
15. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise as the designee of Rep-
resentative STEFANIK, and I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike all of the bill and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be referred to as the ‘‘Wage 
Equity Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
(1) In 1963, Congress passed on a bipartisan 
basis the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to prohibit 
discrimination on account of sex in the pay-
ment of wages for equal work performed by 
employees for employers engaged in com-
merce or in the production of goods for com-
merce. 
(2) Following the passage of such Act, in 
1964, Congress passed on a bipartisan basis 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Since the pas-
sage of both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, women have 
made significant strides, both in the work-
force and in their educational pursuits. 
(3) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, there 
were over 77,000,000 women in the workforce, 
the most in American history. Of the 
2,000,000 jobs created in 2019, 53 percent went 
to women. This follows a trend that has been 
rising for some time. Women are graduating 
from college at a higher rate than their male 
counter parts, making up 61 percent of all 
college degrees conferred in 2018. Addition-
ally, according to a recent survey of working 
women, more than half are their family’s 
primary breadwinner. 
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic has had a sig-
nificant impact on working women, resulting 
in over 2 million women leaving the work-
force since February 2020. 
(5) Despite these advances there is still 
concern among the American public that 
gender-based wage discrimination has not 
been eliminated. 
SEC. 3. CLARIFYING SEX-BASED DISCRIMINATION 
PROHIBITION. 
Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended by 
inserting ‘‘bona fide business-related’’ after 
‘‘any other’’. 
SEC. 4. JOB AND WAGE ANALYSIS. 
Section 16 of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(f)(1) An employer shall not be liable in 
an action brought against the employer for a 
violation of section 6(d) if— 
‘‘(A) during the period beginning on the 
date that is 3 years before the date on which 
the action is brought and ending on the date 
that is 1 day before the date on which the ac-
tion is brought, such employer completes a 
job and wage analysis audit to determine 
whether there are differentials in wage rates 
among such employees that may violate sec-
tion 6(d); 
‘‘(B) such employer takes reasonable steps 
to remedy any such differentials; and 
‘‘(C) such job and wage analysis audit is 
conducted and such reasonable steps are 
taken in good faith to investigate whether 
any such differentials exist; and 
‘‘(D) such audit is reasonable in detail and 
scope with respect to the size of the em-
ployer. 
‘‘(2) A job and wage analysis audit under 
this section and remedial action taken in re-
sponse to the findings of such audit— 
‘‘(A) may only be admissible by the em-
ployer for the purposes of showing— 
‘‘(i) such audit was conducted; and 
‘‘(ii) such reasonable steps were taken; and 
‘‘(B) shall not be discoverable or admis-
sible for any other purpose in any claim 
against the employer. 
‘‘(3) An employer who has not completed a 
job and wage analysis audit under this sub-
section shall not be subject to a negative or 
adverse inference as a result of not having 
completed such audit. 
‘‘(4) An employer who has completed a job 
and wage analysis audit that does not meets 
the requirements of subparagraph (D) of 
paragraph (1) but otherwise meets the re-
quirements of such paragraph shall not be 
liable for liquidated damages under section 
16(b). 
‘‘(5) In this section— 
‘‘(A) the term ‘job and wage analysis audit’ 
means an audit conducted by the employer 
for the purpose of identifying wage dispari-
ties among employees on the basis of sex; 
and 
‘‘(B) the term ‘reasonable steps’, with re-
spect to differentials in wages among em-
ployees that may violate section 6(d), means 
steps that are reasonable to address such dif-
ferentials taking into account— 
‘‘(i) the amount of time that has passed 
since the date on which the audit was initi-
ated; 
‘‘(ii) the nature and degree of progress re-
sulting from such reasonable steps toward 
compliance with section 6(d) compared to 
the number of employees with respect to 
whom a violation may exist and the amount 
of the wage rate differentials among such 
employees; and 
‘‘(iii) the size and resources of the em-
ployer.’’. 
SEC. 5. WAGE HISTORY; DISCUSSION OF WAGES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 7 the following new 
section: 
‘‘SEC. 8. PROVISIONS RELATING TO WAGE HIS-
TORY AND DISCUSSION OF WAGE.

LATING TO WAGE HISTORY.—It shall be an un-

ployee for employment, including by requir-
ing that the wage history of a prospective

criteria as a condition of being considered 
for employment; or 
‘‘(B) in determining the rate of wage for 
such prospective employee; or 
‘‘(2) to seek, or to require a prospective 
employee to disclose, the wage history of

standing subsection (a)(2), a person may take 
actions necessary to verify the wage history 
of a prospective employee if such wage his-
tory is voluntarily disclosed to the person by

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 303, the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Iowa. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, equal work deserves 
equal pay, and we owe it to women to 
constructively engage on addressing 
pay disparities in the workplace and 
put forward real solutions. Unfortu-
nately, Democrats have put forth a bill 
that prioritizes lawsuits and govern-
ment regulation over women’s eco-
nomic empowerment and advancement. 
H.R. 7 would require employers to 
make intrusive data disclosures that 
would add compliance costs exceeding 
$600 million per year while posing seri-
ous threats to workers’ privacy and 
their paychecks. 
On top of these onerous new require-
ments, H.R. 7 will force America’s busi-
nesses to prepare for an onslaught of 
frivolous lawsuits, which now will be 
open to unlimited compensatory and 
limited damages. 
Forty percent of small businesses are 
run by women, and H.R. 7 would make 
it harder for these women business 
owners to succeed. 
This issue is too important to leave 
to partisan solutions. Our amendment, 
the Wage Equity Act, offers a stark 
contrast to the approach laid out in 
H.R. 7. We look to innovation in the 
States to find bipartisan policy that is 
supported by both Republicans and 
Democrats and signed by Republican 
Governors—proof that equal pay for 
equal work is not a partisan issue. 
The Wage Equity Act supports the 
empowerment of women in today’s 
economy. America’s businesses—par-
ticularly our small businesses—seek to 
do right by their employees. In rec-
ognition of this, the Wage Equity Act 
creates a voluntary pay analysis sys-
tem to encourage the good-faith efforts 
of employers to self-identify and cor-
rect any wage disparities, should they 
exist, creating an environment of con-
sistent self-reflection. 
We believe every American should be 
able to negotiate employment based 
upon their qualifications and merit for 
the position, and that a victim of wage 
discrimination should not have this 
discrimination follow them to their 
next job and compound through the 
rest of their career. 
This is why this amendment protects 
the employee’s right to not disclose 
their salary history during the job 
interview process unless they wish to 
do so voluntarily. At the same time, we 
cannot erode the necessary negotia-
tions that take place in a job inter-
view. 
The Wage Equity Act protects the 
ability for an employee and their pro-
spective employer to have a pay expec-
tation conversation, an important part 
of any negotiation. 
Our amendment protects employees’ 
ability to discuss compensation with

their colleagues while giving employ-
ers the ability to set reasonable limita-
tions on the time, location, and man-
ner of this activity to protect employ-
ees from harassment. 
Furthermore, the Wage Equity Act 
seeks to put women on equal footing as 
men as they start their careers with a 
grant 
program 
targeted 
towards 
women in college and career tech pro-
grams to provide negotiation skills 
education. 
Lastly, our amendment directs the 
GAO to study the manager’s gap to 
give us a clearer sense of the impact 
new parents leaving the workforce 
have on an employee’s future earning 
and opportunity potential. 
These are commonsense proposals 
that are supported by both Democrats 
and Republicans alike. I encourage my 
colleagues to reject partisan Govern-
ment overreach and to support prac-
tical, bipartisan solutions that improve 
the existing law of the land—equal pay 
for equal work—by voting for the 
Stefanik amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES). 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment would allow employers to 
self-audit compensation disparity. Ask-
ing the same employer, who may be en-
gaged in pay discrimination, to self-po-
lice their wage practices is a blatant 
conflict of interest. 
Rather than actually incentivizing 
equal pay, as Ms. STEFANIK
would 
claim, this amendment gives employ-
ers the tool to hide evidence of pay dis-
crimination and delay any resulting 
lawsuit and accountability by 3 years. 
The very idea behind this provision is 
insidious. It presumes that employers 
should be given loopholes to avoid li-
ability after breaking the law. Employ-
ers do not need a workaround to guard 
against these types of lawsuits. Their 
best defense is simple: do not engage in 
wage discrimination. 
In fact, this amendment actually cre-
ates another means for employers to 
discriminate on the basis of sex by pre-
serving a vague standard for employer 
defense when accused of wage discrimi-
nation. Unlike Ms. STEFANIK’s proposed 
amendment, H.R. 7 makes clear that 
the ‘‘any factor other than sex’’ em-
ployer defense must be bona fide, job- 
related, and required by business neces-
sity. 
Employees must be judged by their 
education, training or experience in-
stead of their gender. As women drop 
out of the workforce in historic num-
bers due to the pressures of COVID–19, 
we have a responsibility to take every 
precaution to ensure they do not face 
discrimination when they return to the 
workforce. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act ensures 
all workers will get equal pay for equal 
work, regardless of gender. It will pro-
hibit employers from paying women 
less simply because another employer 
paid them less in the past. It helps to 
oppose pay discrimination with more 
speed and transparency, and allows 
women to fight pay injustices they 
may experience. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act fixes a systemic injustice that 
women have suffered. 
This amendment would only water 
down this landmark civil rights and 
labor legislation. Madam Speaker, I 
strongly encourage my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ to this amendment and 
stand up for equity. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this amendment, which was also intro-
duced earlier this week by Representa-
tive STEFANIK as a standalone bill, H.R. 
2491, the Wage Equity Act of 2021. 
Unlike the so-called Paycheck Fair-
ness Act, which will unfairly punish 
businessowners and reward trial law-
yers at the expense of workers, this 
amendment will effectively address pay 
discrimination in the workplace and 
help working women by ensuring pay 
differences among workers of the oppo-
site sex are due to legitimate business- 
related reasons. 
Among other commonsense provi-
sions, this amendment will direct funds 
and research towards women’s ad-
vancement in the workplace and will 
also authorize a grant program to edu-
cate women in college careers and 
technical programs on negotiating pay. 
This amendment will also allow job 
applicants to disclose prior salary his-
tory voluntarily, ensuring they control 
this information as they see fit. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), who is the sponsor of the 
underlying legislation. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, the 
gender pay gap is a pervasive problem 
that 
demands 
thoughtful, 
multipronged solutions. The Paycheck 
Fairness Act represents a comprehen-
sive response to the shortcomings of 
existing law and addresses the holes 
that have emerged over time. 
Representative 
STEFANIK’s 
sub-
stitute, the Wage Equity Act, is ex-
actly what the Paycheck Fairness Act 
has been fighting over the years. It 
purports to offer protections, but, in 
reality, it creates loopholes that give a 
wink and a nod to discrimination. Not 
only would it offer empty protections, 
it would erode existing protections al-
ready in place. 
The substitute includes inadequate 
protections for workers who discuss or 
disclose wages. While ostensibly pro-
tecting employees who disclose or dis-
cuss that pay, it allows employers to 
place limitations on when, where, and 
how employees may do so, negating the 
point of the provision. 
Madam Speaker, you cannot remedy 
pay discrimination if you have no idea 
that you are making less than the man 
across the hall. When workers fear re-
taliation for talking about their pay, 
any wage gap they face is likely to con-
tinue to grow undiscovered in the shad-
ows. 
More egregiously, there is no mecha-
nism for enforcement, as it would allow 
employers who conduct self-designed 
pay audits to escape accountability for 
unlawful pay disparities and deny a 
worker a remedy. 
I think it bears repeating that cor-
porations do not feel free to sell us 
spoiled meat, lock our daughters up in 
ninth-floor sweatshops with no fire es-
capes, employ our underage sons in 
coal mines, force us to work 13-hour 
shifts without overtime or a break be-
cause corporations experienced a mo-
ment of Zen and decided to evolve. 
No. They were forced into greater ac-
countability and social concern by the 
legitimate actions of a democratic gov-
ernment. In other words, if we depend 
on goodwill or a self-audit, then we are 
all screwed. 
This amendment seeks to destroy the 
entire purpose of the bill and allows 
companies to evade accountability for 
violating the law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this amendment and a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
for the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I would hope we would defeat the 
amendment. This just recreates the 
loopholes that we are trying to close. 
You have to start with the idea that 
there is a differential in pay. And what 
we are trying to do is—if you can ex-
plain this in any kind of way that is 
business-related, then they get away 
with it. 
The Fair Pay Act says it has to be 
bona fide and required by the job. If it 
is not required by the job, why do you 
have a differential in pay? 
We can do better than this, and I 
hope we defeat the amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 303, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman 
from

Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

TRIBUTE TO JOE NOVOTNY 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the outstanding service of 
the Reading Clerk of the United States 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
Joe 
Novotny, as he prepares for his retire-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, as Reading Clerk, Joe 
Novotny has served as the voice of the 
House, and his trusted leadership and 
valued presence on this floor will be 
missed by Members and staff on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Joe Novotny has dedicated his entire 
career to the people’s House. First 
serving as a congressional page at age 
16, Joe returned to the House after col-
lege, where he worked for the House 
Education and Labor Committee for 15 
years, rising to become chief clerk. 
His service was respected by all, in-
cluding my friend, Chairman George 
Miller, who lauded Joe as ‘‘an incred-
ibly valuable asset to my staff whose 
unparalleled integrity and dedication 
helped our committee advance major 
policies that are making a difference in 
the lives of working families.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I just learned from our 
colleague DAN KILDEE that his uncle, 
Dale Kildee, a leading member of the 
Education and Labor Committee, was 
also a good friend and benefited from

the service and leadership of Joe 
Novotny. 
In 2010, it was my great and proud 
honor as Speaker of the House to name 
Joe Novotny Reading Clerk, the first 
openly gay man to hold this position. I 
am proud of that. 
His historic service has made our 
Congress more inclusive, diverse, and 
representative of the people we serve. 
As 
the 
child 
of 
immigrants, 
Novotny’s ascendance in the halls of 
the U.S. Capitol is, as he has proudly 
said, the story of the American Dream. 
As Reading Clerk, Novotny has been 
vital in engaging the people of our 
country with their democracy. Each 
day, he ensures that measures debated 
in this House are clearly articulated 
not only to Members but to the Amer-
ican people and to people around the 
world. 
His commitment to making Congress 
more accessible and efficient has been 
particularly 
important 
during 
this 
time of pandemic, as our institution 
has adjusted to remote and virtual op-
erations. 
Since day one, Joe has brought his 
steady presence, professionalism, and 
institutional expertise to the House 
floor. In doing so, he has helped ad-
vance the ability of the people’s House 
to do the people’s work. 
I am taking this additional time, Mr. 
Speaker, because so many Members 
have told me what Joe means to them, 
and I wanted to express some of that in 
my remarks. 
While Joe Novotny’s service will be 
missed, his great love for the House 
and his dedication to our democracy 
stand as an inspiration for all who will 
follow in the path that he has blazed. 
On behalf of the United States House 
of Representatives, I wish him the best 
in the next stages of his journey, and I 
thank Joe for his patriotic service. 
Thank you, Joe Novotny.

POSTAL NONBANK FINANCIAL 
SERVICES 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Appropria-
tions Committee, I am very honored to 
be co-leading efforts to provide $6 mil-
lion for postal nonbank financial serv-
ices in a pilot program through the 
U.S. Postal Service. 
I am thankful to my House col-
leagues, Congressman BILL PASCRELL 
and 
Congresswoman 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, and our friends in the 
Senate for joining our effort. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has dem-
onstrated that many Americans are 
left behind by Wall Street bankers. 
As unemployment soared in 2020, the 
U.S. Congress swiftly provided relief 
through economic stimulus payments, 
unemployment insurance, and so much 
more to America’s workers, yet over 63 
million Americans, including many 
who are impoverished, lacked the most 
basic banking services to access these 
funds and to conduct the simplest fi-
nancial transactions. Like, for exam-
ple, paying a utility bill. 
Yes, according to the FDIC, some 63 
million adults are considered under-
banked in urban, suburban, and rural

In the last Congress, Congressman 
PASCRELL and I successfully led a Fi-

our bill and to getting it passed in both 
Chambers this year.

RECOGNIZING 
CAPTAIN 
PATRICK 
C. POLIS AS TENNESSEE’S SEC-
OND DISTRICT VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Captain Patrick C. 
Polis as Tennessee’s Second District 
Veteran of the Month. 
Captain Polis was drafted into the 
United States Army in 1966 as a pri-
vate, then attended Officer Candidate 
School and earned the rank of second 
lieutenant. He served two combat tours 
of duty, Madam Speaker, during the 
Vietnam war, rising to the rank of cap-
tain during the war. He was later 
awarded the Bronze Star Medal and 
Army Commendation Medal for his 
service. 
He left the Army in 1974 and, regret-
tably, he attended the University of 
Alabama, being we are from Tennessee, 
but he did graduate magna cum laude 
in 1981. 
Following a career in business man-
agement, he returned to school at the 
Asbury 
Theological 
Seminary 
and 
earned a master’s degree in divinity in 
1993. He used his religious education to 
serve as a pastor at the United Meth-
odist Church in Knoxville from 1993 to 
2019. He also served as chaplain for the 
Knoxville Police Department. 
In 2019, he was inducted into the 
Army Officer Candidate School Hall of 
Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia. 
Captain Polis and his wife, Sandra, 
still reside in Knoxville. He remains 
active 
in 
the 
veteran 
community 
through 
the 
Vietnam 
Veterans 
of 
America, serving as president of the 
Captain Bill Robinson Chapter 1078. 
I thank Captain Polis so much for his 
service to our country. It is my honor 
to recognize him today on the floor of 
the House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, he is just an out-
standing individual.

championship, 
securing 
their 
first-ever State basketball title. 
On March 27, the team defeated the 
defending champion, Chartiers Valley, 
51–27, led by junior Sydni Scott’s game- 
high 16 points. 
The victory made history on several 
fronts. Not only was this the school’s 
first State basketball championship, 
but it also marked just the third time 
a mother-daughter duo has won a PIAA 
state title, with Coach Chrissie Doogan 
at the helm and her daughter Maggie 
playing forward. O’Hara’s win also gave 
the Philadelphia Catholic League the 
distinction of becoming the first league 
to win three straight girls’ titles in the 
same year. 
The young women of Cardinal O’Hara 
are an inspiration to our Delaware Val-
ley community. Congratulations to the 
entire Lady Lions basketball team. 
Keep making HERstory.

OPPOSE PACKING THE SUPREME 
COURT 
(Mr. GIMENEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong opposition to the pro-
posal by some Members to pack the Su-
preme Court. 
At first glance, you would think this 
came from Hugo Chavez or Nicolas 
Maduro, pictured here. It is sad to see 
that it actually comes from some peo-
ple in this institution. 
As a Cuban exile who fled the Com-
munist Castro regime, I know the con-
sequences of these dictatorial moves to 
centralize power in the hands of a few 
ideologues. 
Packing the courts is a tactic used 
by brutal dictatorships, like Venezuela, 
to consolidate the Socialists’ power, 
which resulted in tens of thousands of 
court rulings in its favor and basically 
destroyed the country. 
Packing the courts sets the prece-
dent for the judicial branch being ex-
panded at every transition of power, 
with each President wanting to put 
their four or more additional Justices, 
which eventually could result in hun-
dreds of Justices of the Supreme Court. 
This proposal to fundamentally re-
balance our judicial system towards 
one political ideology should not only 
be opposed, but must be condemned to 
the fullest extent. 
I will fight to my last breath the at-
tempts by anyone to fundamentally 
change government in such a militant 
manner.

WOMEN STILL DON’T EARN EQUAL 
PAY FOR EQUAL WORK 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, it has been 58 years since the 
enactment of the Equal Pay Act, yet 
still women don’t earn equal pay for 
equal work. 
In my district, women only earn 78 
cents for every dollar a man earns. The 
wage gap is even wider for Latina, 
Black, and Native-American women. 
This isn’t simply a women’s issue. 
This is a family issue. When women 
earn too little, their families are short-
changed, too. 
This is a civil rights issue. When em-
ployers discriminate against a woman, 
they undermine justice for everyone. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act will give 
women the tools we need to challenge 
sex-based pay discrimination. It will 
give employers the guidance they need 
to pay their employees what they de-
serve. 
I ask my colleagues in the Senate to 
step up. Let this be the year that we 
work together to pass this landmark 
bill and send it to the President for his 
signature.

HONORING JACK MARSHALL 
JONES, JR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Jack Marshall Jones, Jr., of Sa-
vannah, Georgia, who, sadly, passed 
away on April 3 at the age of 84. 
Jack was born in Savannah and went 
on to graduate from the University of 
North Carolina, Chapel Hill with a de-
gree in economics. 
As an active member in the Savan-
nah community, Jack served on several 
boards, 
including 
Armstrong 
State 
University 
Foundation, 
Savannah 
Country Day School, and the Savannah 
Rotary Club. 
Jack was also a founder and director 
of First Bank of Savannah and the Sa-
vannah Bancorp. 
In his free time, Jack enjoyed explor-
ing the Wilmington River and the 
treasure of our beautiful coast. 
However, it was his loving relation-
ship with his wife of 60 years, his fam-
ily—including his granddaughter and a 
former member of my staff, Caroline— 
and friends that fulfilled him. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact he had on the Savannah commu-
nity, and I know his legacy will re-
main. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all those who knew 
him during this most difficult time.

CELEBRATING YOM HA’ATZMAUT 
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition and celebration of 
Yom Ha’atzmaut, Israel’s Independence 
Day. 
On this day 73 years ago, the Israeli 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
was 
signed, marking a long-awaited his-
toric day, the formation of the world’s 
only Jewish state in its modern form. 
As a proud American Jew and a proud 
supporter of Israel, it is a privilege to 
recognize Israel and its contributions 
to the international community. 
Israeli 
innovation 
in 
areas 
like 
water, 
technology, 
and 
agriculture 
have yielded dramatic advancements 
with global impact. 
I am proud the bills passed in this 
Chamber, including legislation to af-
firm Congress’ overwhelming support 
for Israel and strengthen the U.S.- 
Israel relationship. 
We are witnessing a new era as Arab 
States normalize their relations with 
Israel, which will create incredible op-
portunities for cooperation in the Mid-
dle East. I look forward to supporting 
those growing ties. 
I am proud to stand here today in 
strong support of Israel and the U.S.- 
Israel relationship on this 73rd Yom 
Ha’atzmaut.

IN HONOR OF ISRAEL 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, 73 
years ago, in the aftermath of the Hol-
ocaust, a courageous group of Jewish 
leaders declared the creation of the 
State of Israel. Eleven minutes later, 
President Truman announced the U.S. 
recognition of the new State. 
Truman was persuaded that in an 
area like the Middle East, where there 
had never been any tradition of demo-
cratic government, it was important 
for the long range security of our coun-
try that a nation committed to a 
democratic 
system 
be 
established 
there. 
Even today, Israel remains the only 
democracy in the Middle East with fair 
elections, a free press, free speech, a 
court system that is open to all, and 
protects the rights of women and mi-
norities. 
Israel has welcomed millions of im-
migrants fleeing persecution and war 
from across the globe. Its thriving 
economy has a vibrant, high-tech sec-
tor and medical breakthroughs that 
have benefited the world. Israel has lit-
erally made the desert bloom with in-
novative irrigation, desalinization, and 
agricultural techniques. 
Israel is our most reliable ally in the 
Middle East. Our countries share mili-
tary exercises and intelligence and 
have developed cutting-edge missile de-
fense systems and border security tech-
nology. 
Israel’s brave founders created an ex-
traordinary nation that has provided 
immeasurable value to our country and 
the world. May our countries be blessed 
with many more years of friendship.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
absurd proposal brought forth now to 
pack the U.S. Supreme Court out of 
thin air with four new Justices is the 
latest in a breathtaking effort to seize 
and seal power for Democrats. They 
know their policies frequently don’t 
win at the ballot box or in fair elec-
tions, so they seek to stack a Court 
with a new set of Justices that they 
hope will hand them victories outside 
of the hallowed legislative process. 
Justice Breyer, the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, and even Joe Biden 
himself—who is quoted as saying pack-
ing the Court is a ‘‘bonehead idea’’—all 
disagree, at least at one time, that 
packing the Court to simply grab a ma-
jority is wrong-headed and un-Amer-
ican. 
I am glad to enter into a constitu-
tional amendment with Representative 
DUSTY JOHNSON to ‘‘Keep the 9’’ and 
save our Supreme Court, to keep it 
above politics. 
This is one of the most blatant, 
naked power grabs we have seen, ever. 
If this effort is somehow successful and 
allowed to stand, then you will not rec-
ognize the America we know, once 
knew, as pure power politics will in-
deed have won over our process that 
the Founders put in place.

CELEBRATING ISRAEL 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to join with my colleagues 
in recognition and celebration of the 
independence of the State of Israel 73 
years ago today. 
Seventy-three years ago today, the 
United States became the first country 
to recognize Israel, and I am proud to 
join those here in the United States 
and around the world in wishing the 
people 
of 
Israel 
a 
happy 
Yom 
Ha’atzmaut. 
Today, we reaffirm the critical, un-
breakable bond between our two na-
tions. The United States and Israel 
have a friendship rooted in our shared 
values that goes back decades. Israel is 
our strongest ally in the Middle East 
and one of our most important allies in 
the world. Today, the cultural and so-
cietal bonds between our two countries 
remains as strong as ever. 
Today is a day of celebration for 
Israel: Celebrating her perseverance, 
economic growth, cultural achieve-
ments, and democratic values that 
have developed in the decades since 
their independence. 
Israel’s existence as a Jewish, demo-
cratic, secure state is vital to both the 
Jewish community and the peace of the 
entire Middle East. 
I vow to continue to do my work sup-
porting and strengthening the U.S.- 
Israel relationship so that we can keep 
working together for our shared goals. 
Israel has become a country of innova-
tion and growth, one where there are 
prospects for peace in the region. I look 
forward to continuing that relation-
ship.

OUTSTANDING YOUNG ATHLETES 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, as an 
avid basketball player, it gives me 
great pleasure to recognize the excep-
tional achievements of the high school 
basketball players in Northwest Indi-
ana this past year, who safely showed 
up and put in the effort during the 
challenges of this health pandemic. 
I also want to recognize the following 
programs who represented our region 
during the semi-State and beyond this 
past season. 
First, congratulations to the Lady 
Bulldogs of Crown Point High School 
women’s basketball team, who won the 
Indiana High School Athletic Associa-
tion’s 4A State Championship. 
Congratulations also to the Gary 
West Side High School men’s basket-
ball team who won their regional 
championship game to advance to Indi-
ana’s Class 4A Semi-State. 
And congratulations to the Kouts 
High School men’s basketball team for 
winning their Semi-State Champion-
ship for the first time in the school’s 
history. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing these outstanding young 
athletes for their skill, tremendous 
hard work, and dedication to the game. 
They make all of Northwest Indiana 
and their schools, families, and com-
munities so very proud.

ISRAEL’S RESILIENCY 
(Mr. TORRES of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, Israel embodies the resil-
ience, the ingenuity, the can-do come-
back spirit of humanity at its best. 
One need not be Israeli to be inspired 
by the survival and success of Israel, 
which has persisted in the face of im-
probable odds. One need not be Jewish 
to be inspired by a Jewish state whose 
rebirth and resilience and resourceful-
ness is one of the greatest success sto-
ries the world has ever seen. 
A tiny nation the size of New Jersey 
has emerged, in the span of a few dec-
ades, as a global power and a global in-
novator, as a start-up nation and as a 
water superpower. 
The story of Israel’s renaissance 
takes 
on 
special 
meaning 
in 
our 
present moment, at a time when our 
own country is reeling from the cata-
clysm of COVID–19. Israel reminds us 
that it is possible to overcome. It is 
possible to emerge stronger than ever. 
And it is possible, in the words of 
President Joe Biden, to ‘‘build back 
better.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Israel has endured 
for more than seven decades. And by 
the grace of God, may it endure for 
many more.

I rise today to show exuberance and ex-

Congratulations to Coach Sampson

ton, and certainly of the University of 
Houston. We congratulate them for 
standing up, marching onto that court, 
and dunking that ball. 
Congratulations to the University of

WHERE ARE THE JOBS 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
it has been 85 days since President 
Biden halted the Keystone pipeline. We 
have yet to see those green jobs he 
promised. Promises won’t pay the bills. 
We 
stand 
with 
the 
hardworking 
Americans who were forced out of work 
and ask this administration, Where are 
the jobs? Knee-jerk policies here in 
Washington have life-altering implica-
tions for people like Mr. Neal Crabtree, 
a welder and union foreman from my 
district who lost his job on the Key-
stone pipeline. 
Of course, if you bring up this topic 
with Climate Czar John Kerry, he will 
tell you all these workers can switch to 
working in solar energy. 
Madam Speaker, from looking at sal-
ary data, a welding wand in the hand of 
a highly-skilled pipeline welder is 
worth more than two screwdrivers in 
the hands of solar panel installers. 
These job-killing energy policies are 
yet another example of how out of 
touch the Biden administration is with 
the men and women who keep our 
country going. 
Talk is cheap, action is harder. If 
President Biden is going to continue 
promising these elusive green jobs, 
then he needs a long-term plan in

KEYSTONE PIPELINE JOBS 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, with 
the stroke of his pen, President Biden 
canceled more than the Keystone XL 
pipeline. He canceled the jobs of over 
1,000 men and women. 
Each one of these jobs is a real per-
son with real hopes for themselves and 
their families who are now out of work 
because they did not have a Biden ad-
ministration 
‘‘approved 
job.’’ 
The 
workforce that works on our energy 
sector is as diverse as our nation. 
Madam Speaker, 24 percent of pipe-
line construction workers are women, 
and another 24 percent are minorities. 
The Biden administration is telling 
these pipeline workers their careers are 
over and to find a green job that they 
are not trained to do and that does not 
pay as much. They are telling single 
moms and single dads that they have 
to give up the jobs that supported their 
families. 
Joe Biden should not destroy the jobs 
that support the workers and families 
who have provided the fuel for the 
American economy and that has low-
ered energy costs for American fami-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, this is an economic 
injustice that should not be tolerated. 
These workers and their families de-
serve better. 
f 
BIDEN’S CLIMATE EXECUTIVE 
ORDER 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, 
there are consequences to Biden’s en-
ergy bans. They are job-killing impacts 
that affect my district, my State, and 
our Nation. 
There are two drilling rigs operating 
in western Colorado right now. That 
number was once as high as 112 and in 
the last 13 years there were as many as 
80 rigs. An economic analysis from Col-
orado Mesa University found that each 
drilling rig in the region supports the 
creation of 208 jobs. And now there are 
just two in the Piceance Valley. 
Madam Speaker, 9,000 jobs in the oil 
and gas industry have been lost in the 
last year. Keep in mind that that does 
not include the jobs that we have lost 
from industries serving the rigs and 
their workers. These 9,000 jobs produce 
substantial paychecks for folks back 
home to feed their families and to put 
a roof over their head, and now they 
are gone. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
hits 
our 
schools, where superintendents from 
back home have spoken out on the 
need for these funds. Colorado’s oil and 
natural gas industry provided $839 mil-
lion for K–12 schools in 2015 and 2016. 
And that is why I have introduced 
the Protecting American Energy Jobs 
Act. My legislation will nullify Biden’s 
executive orders. 
f 
BIDEN BANS 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
right out of the gate, President Biden 
took unilateral action that dealt dev-
astating blows to rural communities 
across the United States. 
As chairman of the Western Caucus, I 
have heard firsthand how the cancella-
tion of the Keystone pipeline and the 
moratorium on Federal oil and gas 
leases have directly impacted rural 
America. 
From eliminating good-paying union 
jobs in Minnesota and decimating 
small businesses in South Dakota, to 
gutting local government and school 
district revenues in New Mexico, to 
harming State infrastructure budgets 
in Utah, these orders have negatively 
impacted workers, families, and busi-
ness owners throughout the West. 
But let’s be clear: All Americans will 
feel the effects of President Biden’s ac-
tions. 
Also, let’s be clear: Just because we 
cut domestic energy production, does 
not mean our energy needs decrease. 
Our Nation will face higher costs on 
energy, on goods, on transportation. 
Under this ban, the President has 
throttled our economic recovery. We 
will continue working to reverse these 
misguided actions.

HIGHLIGHTING DOMESTIC ENERGY 
PRODUCTION 
(Mr. BURGESS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to join my fellow Republicans 
tonight to talk about the state of en-
ergy and the very dangerous Biden ban 
on energy production in this country. 
This country needs a reliable, afford-
able supply of energy, but the Biden ex-
ecutive orders reduce access to energy 
sources. 
America 
has 
only 
very 
recently 
achieved energy independence through 
innovation, lower regulations, and a 
free market, but these executive orders 
go the other way and will make us de-
pendent on foreign energy producers. 
Make no mistake about it, the en-
ergy will still be produced, maybe just 
not in the United States. But year over 
year, since 2005, America’s carbon 
emissions have declined, in spite of in-
creased production. 
I draw attention to the data shared 
with the Congress by the Texas Oil and 
Gas Association: Reduction of flaring 
in 
the 
Permian 
Basin 
has 
really 
brought carbon emissions down. 
We can’t strangle ourselves. We need 
to have American energy. We need 
American energy independence.

DESTROYING THOUSANDS OF 
ENERGY JOBS 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, on 
day one of this administration, Joe 
Biden destroyed thousands of jobs at 
the stroke of a pen. 
One of these jobs was held by my con-
stituent, Patrick Thorssen, an oper-
ating engineer and a member of Local 
49. By stopping the Keystone XL pipe-
line, Joe Biden devastated countless 
families and communities. 
Madam Speaker, I am asking to-
night: Mr. President, where are these 1 
million jobs? These families and com-
munities deserve better.

HIGH ENERGY COSTS HURT THOSE 
MOST VULNERABLE 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
fear that the recent actions by the ad-
ministration to end energy develop-
ment on Federal land will come at an 
extremely high cost to the people of 
the United States, and that cost will be 
borne disproportionately by the seg-
ment of our population who can least 
afford to pay it. 
As an example, I offer my home State 
of California, which, according to the 
United States Census Bureau, has the 
highest rate of poverty of any State in 
the country. That poverty rate is driv-
en in no small part by the extremely 
high cost of energy in California. 
To take those misguided policies and 
extend them to the rest of the country 
would be an abdication of our responsi-
bility to protect the most vulnerable 
segment of our population, the poor 
and the working poor, on whose backs 
the burden of higher energy costs will 
be felt most keenly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1839 
April 15, 2021 
pipeline. Instantly, 70 people in Fallon 
County, Montana, were out of their 
jobs. 
This project would provide 12,000 
American jobs and had already created 
200 jobs in Montana alone. This picture 
beside me was taken in Fallon County, 
one of the areas the Keystone XL pipe-
line would have gone through. This 
empty lot would have been a housing 
complex for 1,200 workers, who would 
have contributed significantly to the 
local economy in Baker, Montana, a 
small town of 1,800 residents. 
The cancellation of the pipeline deals 
Fallon County a loss of $7 million per 
year in tax revenue that would have 
been used to invest in schools, roads, 
and other public projects. As Fallon 
County Commissioner Steve Baldwin 
said: ‘‘The cancellation for the XL 
pipeline will further exacerbate our al-
ready weakened economy. President 
Biden has an opportunity to signal that 
access to good-paying jobs is truly a 
priority for his administration.’’ 
So my question is: Where are the 
jobs? 
f 
PLACATING THE LEFT 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
why would President Biden, with the 
stroke of a pen, in the middle of one of 
the worst recessions and economic re-
coveries, destroy thousands of good- 
paying pipeline jobs and the livelihoods 
and future of hardworking American 
families? Well, for the same reason he 
has imposed his open border mandates 
that have created an unprecedented 
crisis at our southern border. He is pla-
cating the left. He is putting them in 
charge. And he is allowing them to 
drive their radical agenda to transform 
our economy, our values, and our way 
of life. 
Gaylord Lincoln, a pipeline mechanic 
from South Dakota, said it best: 
‘‘Come down here. See the destruction 
you caused. See the pain of job loss. 
You took our chance to have a decent 
life with a stroke of a pen. It is all BS 
in Washington. They are playing with 
our lives.’’ 
Mr. Lincoln is right; it is BS. They 
are playing with their lives, and this 
President is leading the charge.

ant to section 11(b) of House Resolu-

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 2021 
No. 65 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable JACKY 
ROSEN, a Senator from the State of Ne-
vada. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You are wisdom with-
out end, mercy without limit, and 
strength beyond resistance. Lord, we 
glorify Your Name. 
Today, lead our lawmakers around 
the obstacles that hinder them from 
accomplishing Your purposes. Lord, 
guide 
them 
around 
the 
stumbling 
blocks of resentment, pessimism, and 
unbelief that impede legislative effec-
tiveness. Help our Senators to live to 
honor You. Fill their hours with Your 
redeeming radiance and their hearts 
with Your peace. May they work to ad-
vance the influence of Your Kingdom. 
We pray, in Your loving Name. 
Amen.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, April 15, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable JACKY ROSEN, a Sen-
ator from the State of Nevada, to perform 
the duties of the Chair.

Ms. ROSEN thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN 
AMERICANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, an overwhelming bipartisan 
majority of Senators voted to move 
forward on Senator HIRONO and Sen-
ator 
DUCKWORTH’s 
anti-Asian 
hate 
crimes bill. I was pleased the vote was 
so substantial, 92 to 6. Rarely do you 
see 92 Senators agree to move forward 
with any piece of legislation. But if 
there was ever a topic that deserves a 
strong showing of bipartisan support, 
it is standing up to bigotry and racism 
against a particular group of Ameri-
cans. 
Today, we will continue to work on a 
bipartisan agreement regarding amend-
ments. I have committed to start the 
process with the bipartisan Moran- 
Blumenthal amendment. I understand 
my Republican colleague from Maine 
has some modifications to the bill, 
which we welcome, and those negotia-
tions are proceeding afoot. I expect the 
Republican leader and I, in consulta-
tion with the relevant committees, will 
be able to figure out an appropriate 
number of reasonable, germane, and 
non-gotcha amendments for the Senate 
to consider. 
We 
are 
working 
with 
Senators 
MORAN, GRASSLEY, and COLLINS in a 
very bipartisan way, and we should be 
able to wrap up this bill next week. By 
doing so, the Senate will deliver a pow-
erful message to Asian Americans that 
their voices are heard, their concerns 
are felt, and that their government will 
take swift, decisive action to protect 
them. They are not alone. 
Before I move on, I just want to say 
to my Republican colleagues: This is 
how the Senate can work, even though 
it is closely divided. When there is a 
pressing issue, like the rising tide of 
anti-Asian violence, the Senate can act 
quickly and in a bipartisan way to ad-
dress it. 
We don’t need to always distrust the 
other party. This bill was never in-
tended to be a messaging bill or gotcha 
legislation. This bill is like a drive 
straight down the middle of the fair-
way—well-timed, 
modest, 
unobjectionable. 
At the end of the day, we can achieve 
a result that has both substantive and 
symbolic importance: substantive be-
cause we are going to adjust the focus 
of the Justice Department to better re-
spond to anti-Asian hate crimes and 
symbolic because both parties are 
standing up to deliver a message that 
racism and bigotry have no place—no 
place—in America. That is an undeni-
ably good result. 
f 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another, less happy, matter, this after-
noon the Senate will need to go 
through a rare procedure to discharge a 
nomination from the Judiciary Com-
mittee: Ms. Vanita Gupta to serve as 
Associate Attorney General. 
The daughter of immigrants from 
India, Ms. Gupta is the first civil rights 
attorney and the first woman of color 
to ever be nominated for Associate At-
torney General, the third ranking offi-
cial at the Department of Justice. Her 
public track record is nothing short of 
exemplary. 
In her very first case after law 
school, Ms. Gupta won the release of 
several African Americans who had

been wrongly convicted by all-White 
juries in Texas, clients who eventually 
won a pardon from Texas Governor 
Rick Perry. She continued her work at 
the ACLU, where she launched a bipar-
tisan criminal justice reform effort, be-
fore going on to lead the Civil Rights 
Division of the Justice Department 
under President Obama. 
Despite 
her 
sterling 
credentials, 
some of my Republican colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee would have 
you believe that Ms. Gupta is some 
hair-raising, leftwing radical. In her 
hearing, Ms. Gupta was unfortunately 
subjected to a mind-numbingly repeti-
tious line of questions about whether 
or not she supports the police or wants 
to decriminalize all drugs. 
A conservative judicial organization 
launched a national ad campaign to 
smear her nomination. It was disgrace-
ful. Just yesterday, a Republican Sen-
ator 
on 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
grilled another DOJ nominee, Kristen 
Clarke, over an obviously satirical 
piece she published for her college 
newspaper. 
The political right seems to relish 
trying to score political points by con-
necting every Justice Department to 
hot-button partisan issues, whether or 
not they have any relevance, some-
times to the point of absurdity. And in 
the case of Ms. Gupta, the accusations 
of radicalism are especially false. 
Ms. Gupta has worked with stake-
holders and legislators from all cor-
ners, including a number of Republican 
Senators, during various criminal jus-
tice reform efforts. She has been en-
dorsed by—listen to this—the National 
Fraternal Order of Police. Let me re-
peat that so my colleagues hear it. She 
has been endorsed by the National Fra-
ternal Order of Police, as well as the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police, the Federal Law Enforcement 
Officers Association, and the National 
Sheriffs’ Association. It is making the 
decrying that she is a crazy leftwing 
radical just absurd, and you wonder 
how and why they come to that conclu-
sion. 
Vanita Gupta will make an out-
standing Associate Attorney General. 
The Senate should discharge her nomi-
nation from the Judiciary Committee 
this afternoon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
time and again, prominent Democrats 
show they are no longer content to 
work within the ground rules and 
norms of our institutions. They prefer 
to threaten the institutions them-
selves. 
We have seen it in Presidential elec-
tions when Democrats say our democ-
racy is sacrosanct when they win but 
illegitimate and broken if Republicans 
win. 
We have seen it with the Senate’s 
rules. Democrats just spent 4 years not 
only praising but using the legislative 
filibuster. But now that they hold the 
majority, they say it has actually been 
intrinsically evil all along and must be 
scrapped. 
We are seeing it right now with vot-
ing regulations, where the mere fact 
that sometimes Republicans win elec-
tions has Democrats wanting to re-
write all 50 States’ election laws right 
here in Washington and turn the Fed-
eral Election Commission into a par-
tisan body. 
And then there is the judiciary. In re-
cent years, we have seen the Demo-
cratic leader stand on the steps of the 
Court and threaten that specific Jus-
tices ‘‘won’t know what hit them’’ if 
they didn’t rule the way he wanted. We 
have seen a number of Democratic Sen-
ators send a threatening brief sug-
gesting the Court might need to be ‘‘re-
structured’’ if its rulings upset liberals. 
Last week, President Biden, who was 
marketed to the country as a moderate 
and institutionalist, jumped in with 
both feet. He set up a pseudo-academic 
commission to study the merits of 
packing the Supreme Court. It is just 
an attempt to clothe this transparent 
power play in fake legitimacy. 
But alas, the far left cannot even 
wait for the fake theatrics of the fake 
study to play out. Today, Democrats in 
the Senate and the House have an-
nounced they will once again threaten 
judicial independence from the steps of 
the Court. They are introducing a bill 
to add four new seats to the Supreme 
Court so that Democrats can pack the 
Court, destroy its legitimacy, and 
guarantee the rulings that liberals 
want. 
Across the ideological spectrum, top 
jurists have been outspoken on what a 
terrible idea Court packing would be. 
The late liberal icon, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, explicitly warned against Court 
packing saying: ‘‘If anything would 
make the Court appear partisan, it 
would be that.’’ ‘‘Nine seems to be a 
good number’’—Justice Ginsburg. 
Justice Stephen Breyer reaffirmed 
his own opposition just last week. The 
public, by the way, agrees. They see 
through this discredited concept. One 
survey late last year showed that a 
clear majority of Americans opposed 
packing the Supreme Court. 
But the farthest left activists aren’t 
interested in the common good. They 
want power. And the same Democrats 
and the same corporate media that 
spent the last 4 years hyperventilating 
and declaring a new constitutional cri-
sis was under way every 30 seconds 
seem to be perfectly content to play 
along. 
Now, if Republicans had introduced a 
bill to add four Supreme Court seats 
for the last President to fill, there 
would have been weeks of wall-to-wall 
outrage on every newspaper and cable 
TV channel nonstop. Now it seems the 
main strategies are either to shrug off, 
look the other way, or to actively play 
along and somehow lend credence. 
It is not about whether this insane 
bill becomes law. Part of the point here 
is the threats themselves. The left 
wants a sword dangling over the Jus-
tices when they weigh the facts in 
every case. As the Democratic leader 
threatened just 2 years ago, Democrats 
want the Justices to know that they 
will ‘‘pay the price’’ for rulings that 
Democrats don’t like. 
The left wants these swords dangling 
over the Senate and State legislators 
and independent judges. The threats 
are the point. The hostage-taking is 
the 
point. 
And 
responsible 
people 
across the political spectrum have an 
absolute duty to denounce this. 
(The remarks of Mr. MCCONNELL per-
taining to the introduction of S. 1133 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’)

TRIBUTE TO KATELYN CONNER 
BUNNING 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on one final matter, over 
the years, a lot of talented Kentuck-
ians have joined my team at the start 
of their careers. I have gotten to watch 
them hone their skills and grow into 
real leaders. 
Unfortunately, the privilege of work-
ing with ultratalented young people 
also means you often see a real all-star 
fly the nest, and today I have to offer 
a reluctant goodbye. 
Katelyn Conner Bunning was from 
Louisville. She joined my personal of-
fice almost 11 years ago. She has done 
just about every job there is, from an-
swering phones to mastering policy 
issues. 
For the last 4 years, I have relied on 
her extensively as my legislative direc-
tor. Katelyn has been a key adviser to 
me, a role model to junior staffers, a 
key link between my leadership office 
and my Kentucky-focused staff. Who 
better to help me deliver for the Com-
monwealth than the daughter of a 
former Mr. Kentucky Basketball? 
Along the way, some of the trickiest 
issues facing the Bluegrass have landed 
on Katelyn’s desk: securing retired 
miners’ pensions and healthcare, revi-
talizing abandoned coalfields, strength-
ening Kentucky schools and helping 
students succeed, delivering certainty 
for Kentucky farmers while opening 
new doors for industrial hemp, even 
protecting kids’ health by raising the 
minimum tobacco purchase age to 21.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1953 
April 15, 2021 
Last year, I asked Katelyn to take 
charge of improving safety and medica-
tion standards in the thoroughbred rac-
ing industry. Even as a national publi-
cation was calling to end this sport al-
together, Katelyn assembled owners, 
trainers, jockeys, breeders, and fans to 
preserve Kentucky’s signature indus-
try. 
This is a long list of accomplish-
ments. Yet it is only a short summary 
of Katelyn’s impact on my team and 
our Commonwealth. She has set very 
high standards. She has helped every-
one achieve them. 
We are certainly going to miss her 
around here, but I am sure her husband 
Eric and their new daughter Alice are 
looking forward to seeing a bit more of 
her every day. 
So, Katelyn, thank you for your abil-
ity, for your friendship. I wish you and 
your family all the best.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 13, S.

of COVID–19 hate crimes, and for other pur-
poses. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I feel very privileged to be here 
today to speak on behalf of Vanita 
Gupta, a dedicated public servant who 
is devoted, deeply devoted, to equal 
justice, civil rights, and the rule of 
law. 
I have seen firsthand, and I know I 
am not the only one who has done so, 
her consummate dedication to the in-
tegrity of the Department of Justice, 
which is so vital to be restored at this 
moment in our history. 
The support for her reflects a broad, 
professionally and ideologically diverse 
coalition of individuals and organiza-
tions that know she is eminently quali-
fied to be Associate Attorney General. 
When she is confirmed, she will not 
only be the first civil rights lawyer but 
also the first woman of color to serve 
as Associate Attorney General. 
She is, in effect, the leader we need 
in that position now. And we need it 
right now. The Attorney General needs 
her right now. He has said so. And we 
should be proud to confirm this emi-
nently qualified woman. Hers is the 
character that the Department of Jus-
tice requires to help restore trust and 
credibility. 
Now, the fact is that she has been a 
target of a smear campaign, a vial and 
despicable campaign of lies and decep-
tion that are completely unfounded. 
These attacks are based on demon-
strable lies and mischaracterizations. 
Her previous tenure in the civil 
rights division makes absolutely clear 
her commitment to enforcing the law 
with integrity and honesty, with bal-
ance and insight. She has a proven 
record as a consensus builder and as a 
leader. 
And her work with law enforcement 
is the reason why she has such support 
among law enforcement leaders, and 
that support is across party lines. In 
fact, every major law enforcement or-
ganization refers and supports her 
nomination. 
Try as they might, unfortunately, 
our Republican colleagues continue to 
smear her. She has never—she has 
never called for defunding the police. 
She has never said many of the lies 
that are attributed to her. And even 
more than being unfounded, these at-
tacks are really the height hypocrisy. 
It is unconscionable that Republicans 
would criticize this lifelong public 
servant and Justice Department vet-
eran after they silently sat by when 
there was no Senate-confirmed Asso-
ciate Attorney General for nearly 3 
years during the Trump administra-
tion. The outrage that they feign 
should fall on deaf ears. 
Our moment of reckoning is soon. It 
is not just our moment of reckoning; it 
is a moment of reckoning for the Na-
tion because, in the last year, we have 
faced a global pandemic. We have grap-
pled with racial justice issues that 
have been ignored for too long, and we 
have defended against an onslaught of 
hate and extremism. 
We are at a pivotal moment. We ur-
gently need her kind of leadership to 
combat domestic terrorism, extremist 
violence, and hate crimes. In fact, we 
are in the midst right now of consid-
ering a measure that will help combat 
hate crimes, including my No Hate leg-
islation. We know hate crimes are 
surging, and Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders have been the target of 
them, particularly the alarming wave 
of vitriolic attacks most recently. 
Vanita Gupta has been a leader in 
the fight against hate crimes. As the 
head of the civil rights division, she 
was the Nation’s chief civil rights en-
forcer and prosecutor. And while lead-
ing that division, she also headed the 
first prosecutions under the Matthew 
Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act, which ex-
panded the Federal hate crime law to 
include, among other things, crimes 
motivated by a victim’s sexual orienta-
tion—crimes motivated by whom a per-
son loved. 
During her confirmation hearing, she 
committed to using the Department of 
Justice tools to investigate and pros-
ecute hate crimes where they happen 
and to use its bully pulpit to prevent 
hate from festering in communities 
around the country. 
The plain truth is that Vanita Gupta 
is the right person at the right time for 
this job. The Senate should confirm her 
as supremely qualified for this emi-
nently important assignment, and it 
should do so swiftly with bipartisan 
support. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I am 
feeling a sense of deja vu this morning. 
In March, Democrats used reconcili-
ation to pass a massive, partisan bill 
that served as a cover for a collection 
of 
payoffs 
to 
Democratic 
interest 
groups in Democratic States. 
Now, just over a month later, we are 
facing the prospect of round 2. Demo-
crats are once again looking at rec-
onciliation to pass a massive, partisan 
piece of legislation that serves to cover 
a long wish list of liberal priorities. 
The subject this time, of course, is in-
frastructure—like COVID relief, a sub-
ject that Republicans are very ready to 
tackle, but, just like with their COVID 
bill, Democrats aren’t showing a lot of 
interest 
in 
bipartisan 
cooperation. 
Once again, their message seems to be 
‘‘Go along with everything we want or 
be completely excluded from any part 
of this bill.’’ 
As I said, Republicans would be 
happy to take up infrastructure legis-
lation. Our Nation is overdue for addi-
tional infrastructure investment. But 
an infrastructure bill should be focused 
on 
actual 
infrastructure: 
roads, 
bridges, airports, waterways, and dig-
ital infrastructure like broadband. 
Democrats have some of that in their 
bill, but they also have been very busy 
expanding the definition of ‘‘infra-
structure’’ to include a whole host of 
Democratic priorities. One Democratic 
Senator tweeted: 
Paid leave is infrastructure. Childcare is 
infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure. 
Well, actually, no, they are not. Nei-
ther is the Civilian Climate Corps or 
community colleges or support for Big 
Labor. None of those things are infra-
structure. 
Now, it may be that some—and I say 
‘‘some’’—of Democrats’ noninfrastruc-
ture proposals are things that we 
should have a discussion about here in 
Congress, a bipartisan discussion, but 
they are not infrastructure, and they

don’t belong in an infrastructure bill. 
Democrats should stop rewriting the 
definition of ‘‘infrastructure’’ to suit 
their purposes. The word ‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ is not, in fact, anything that 
Democrats say it is. ‘‘Infrastructure’’ 
has an actual meaning, and it is not 
childcare or assistance for unions. 
Even Democrats’ actual infrastruc-
ture spending is frequently problem-
atic. Democrats’ infrastructure pro-
posals would cost $2.2 trillion. Less 
than 6 percent of that—less than 6 per-
cent—would be spent on roads and 
bridges. Under the Democrats’ plan, 
spending on electric vehicle promotion 
would exceed investments in roads, 
bridges, ports, and waterways com-
bined. That includes tax credits and re-
bates for electric vehicles, measures 
that will primarily benefit wealthier 
car buyers and leave rural States like 
South Dakota, where electric vehicles 
remain impractical, behind. 
The bill also includes a massive sum 
for transit and high-speed rail—sub-
stantially more than the bill spends on 
highways, roads, and bridges—despite 
Americans’ limited interest in rail 
travel. 
On the tax front, Speaker PELOSI has 
expressed her interest in including a 
lifting of the current cap on State and 
local tax deductions. Now, this one is 
really interesting. It is a very inter-
esting priority for Democrats, consid-
ering that repealing the SALT deduc-
tion would mostly benefit wealthy tax-
payers, including that evil 1 percent 
whom Democrats are always talking 
about. But I guess sometimes principle 
has to take a back seat to keeping 
Democratic donors happy. 
While we are talking about taxes, 
let’s talk about how Democrats plan to 
at least partially—and I say ‘‘par-
tially’’ because a lot of this could go on 
to debt—pay for this bill. Democrats 
would like to partially pay for this leg-
islation with the largest corporate tax 
increase in a generation. They would 
sharply increase the corporate tax 
rate, once again putting American 
companies at a disadvantage next to 
their foreign competitors and threat-
ening American jobs and wages. It is 
pretty hard to think of any worse pro-
posal right now, with our economy still 
trying to recover from the effects of 
the pandemic. 
What, in effect, you are doing when 
you are raising taxes dramatically— 
when I say ‘‘raising taxes dramati-
cally,’’ I am talking the largest or 
highest tax rate in the developed 
world. We will be leading the OECD 
when it comes to taxation of businesses 
if the Democrats get their way and 
raise the tax rate on businesses from 21 
percent to 28 percent. What you are 
doing when you do that is not pun-
ishing some corporation; it is pun-
ishing workers who work for those 
companies. This is about jobs. It is fun-
damentally about jobs. When you raise 
taxes on businesses, it hurts jobs. 
Now, there is a history of bipartisan 
collaboration on infrastructure legisla-
tion. Our last major transportation in-
frastructure bill, the FAST Act, was 
supported by both Democrats and Re-
publicans, and it was a remarkably 
successful bill. Last Congress, the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee here in the Senate developed bi-
partisan transportation infrastructure 
legislation. There is absolutely no rea-
son—no reason—why we couldn’t rep-
licate past bipartisan success in this 
Congress. 
The word is that next week the 
Democratic leader is going to bring up 
a bipartisan water infrastructure bill 
that recently passed the Senate Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee 
unanimously. I hope he will. That 
should be a model for a larger infra-
structure bill, not the partisan process 
that Democrats embraced with their 
COVID legislation and not the par-
tisan, wasteful proposal full of non-
infrastructure-related measures that 
Democrats have put forward. 
I saw an op-ed the other day that 
pointed out that ‘‘President Biden 
promised to usher in a golden age of bi-
partisan cooperation, but instead he is 
showing a reverse Midas touch—taking 
issues that once united Republicans 
and Democrats and making them par-
tisan and divisive.’’ Sad but true. But 
the President has a chance to turn that 
around with infrastructure. 
It is not too late for Democrats and 
the President to sit down at the table 
with Republicans and develop a sub-
stantial, 
bipartisan 
proposal 
that 
would address our country’s infrastruc-
ture needs without spending taxpayer 
dollars on wasteful or extraneous pro-
posals. 
I 
am 
encouraged 
that 
President 
Biden is meeting with Republicans on 
infrastructure legislation, but I hope 
these meetings are not just for show. 
The President, as we all recall, met 
with Republicans on COVID legisla-
tion, too, before rejecting bipartisan 
cooperation. Let’s hope he will choose 
a different path this time. 
It is not too late for the President to 
start fulfilling his inauguration prom-
ise of unity and bipartisanship. He 
should start with this infrastructure 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BEN-
NET). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1132 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk a little bit today about a sub-
ject that I have struggled with in 
terms of how to address, and I am 
going to finish my remarks by offering 
a bill up for the Senate’s consideration. 
Mr. President, I know you are aware 
of all of this, but we can’t live without 
glucose. Glucose fuels our cells, and, of 
course, our cells make up our muscles 
and our tissues and our organs, and we 
can’t live without insulin. Insulin is a 
hormone that regulates the amount of 
glucose in our blood. Thankfully, for 
most people, their pancreas produces 
insulin naturally. It is just an undeni-
able fact that without insulin, without 
glucose, you are dead. 
Unfortunately, as you know, some-
times our pancreas does not create in-
sulin or doesn’t create enough insulin 
or creates it erratically, and that con-
dition, of course, is called diabetes. 
Thankfully, 100 years ago, in 1920, 
there was a Canadian physician and 
scientist whose name was Dr. Fred-
erick Banting. He invented a synthetic 
form of insulin to help people whose 
pancreas could not produce the hor-
mone. He won a Nobel Prize for it. It 
was extraordinary. 
He was so committed to helping hu-
manity that he and his other col-
leagues who had patents on this syn-
thetic insulin sold their insulin patents 
for $1, 1 buck. They wanted to make 
sure that insulin was affordable. God 
bless them. 
Today, 34.2 million Americans have 
diabetes. Not all people who have dia-
betes need insulin, but of that 34.2 mil-
lion people, 7.4 million people need syn-
thetic insulin; otherwise, they are dead 
men; they are dead women. Eighty- 
eight million Americans have what we 
call prediabetes. That means they are 
just a hair away from having full- 
blown diabetes. It is a problem in Lou-
isiana, Mr. President, as I am sure it 
might be in Colorado. Louisiana has 
about 500,000 people with diabetes, 
most of whom need insulin. That is 12 
percent of my population. 
Now, here is where the story becomes 
dark. Three pharmaceutical companies 
have a monopoly on synthetic insulin. 
These three companies control about 90 
percent of the global supply of insulin. 
Diabetes is certainly not unique to 
Americans, and these three pharma-
ceutical companies control almost, 
well, virtually, 100 percent of the U.S. 
market. Their cost, as best I can tell, 
you might be surprised to learn that a 
lot of the cost of these pharmaceutical 
drugs—and that is what synthetic insu-
lin is; some call it a biologic—but the 
cost, as best I can tell, to produce a 
vial of insulin is about 10 bucks in to-
day’s dollars. There is no viable ge-
neric. You have to buy a brand name 
from one of the three companies. 
Now, the cost of synthetic insulin has 
increased fairly recently very dramati-
cally. The average list price for insulin 
tripled from 2002 to 2013, and then from 
2013 to 2016 it doubled again. In the last 
10 years, the out-of-pocket costs be-
cause many people have insurance—not 
everyone, but many people have insur-
ance—in the last 10 years, the out-of- 
pocket cost of insulin for the average 
patient has doubled. Most diabetes pa-
tients, to give you some context, re-
quire two, quite often, three vials a 
month.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1955 
April 15, 2021 
Let me try to get out of the concep-
tual and be specific. One type of insu-
lin, and I don’t mean just to single 
them out, but it is called Humalog. It 
was released in 1996. Its price since 
1996, which costs about 10 bucks to 
make it per vial, has increased 1,700 
percent. It has gone from $21 a vial to 
$375 a vial. Now, that same vial in Can-
ada that costs $375 here costs about 50 
bucks in Canada. Remember, you need 
three vials, sometimes two, hopefully, 
a month to live, to survive. So if you 
use three vials a month at 375 bucks a 
crack, the cost has gone from $750 a 
year in 1996 to $13,500 a year. Nothing 
has changed about the insulin. This in-
sulin is 100 years old—100 years old. 
Now, that, of course, is the list price. 
As we know, many people have insur-
ance, and there are all sorts of insur-
ance plans with differing amounts of 
deductions and differing amounts of 
copays, but I think a recent report by 
the Health Care Cost Institute is in-
structive. It found that the average 
American with type 1 diabetes, who 
needs insulin, has out-of-pocket insulin 
costs every year of about $6,000. That is 
every year. You will not be surprised to 
learn that, as a result of that, about 
one in four Americans has to ration the 
insulin—they don’t take their full 
doses—to make them last longer. 
Now, I have a bill. It is called the 
Ending Pricey Insulin Act. I don’t 
know where my staff comes up with 
these names. I can hardly say that. 
Anyway, it is to try to lower the cost 
of insulin. It is going to cap out-of- 
pocket costs for insulin if this bill, in 
its wisdom, passes the Senate. It is 
going to cap the cost at 50 bucks for a 
30-day supply. It is going to cap the 
cost for people who have insurance. It 
is going to cap the cost for people who 
have Medicare. It is going to cap the 
cost for people who have Medicaid, and 
it is going to cap the cost for the peo-
ple who don’t have anything—no insur-
ance whatsoever. It is going to cover 
high-deductible health plans. It is 
going to cover the CHIP program. It is 
going to cover veterans’ health plans. 
It is going to cover TRICARE. It is 
going to cover everybody and have a 
maximum 
out-of-pocket 
cost 
per 
month of $50. 
This bill would take effect for plan 
year 2022. Health plans, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows, set their rates 6 
to 9 months in advance, so I want to 
give them fair warning here. My bill 
provides a workable runway for the in-
surance plans to comply, but the bill 
does include a retroactive clause that 
insures any out-of-pocket costs above 
50 bucks that people pay. After that, 
they will be reimbursed. The bill is 
only five pages long. I don’t think it is 
complicated to fix this problem. 
Now, I really struggled with whether 
to offer this bill. Let me say first that 
I am not trying to pick on our pharma-
ceutical drug companies. What they 
have done in the last year is nothing 
short of miraculous. To me, it is just 
evidence that American and human in-
genuity can never be underestimated, 
and it is extraordinary what the pri-
vate sector can accomplish when the 
government gets out of the way. I am 
talking, 
of 
course, 
about 
the 
coronavirus vaccines. I happen to have 
two brothers who are physicians, and I 
called both of them right after the 
coronavirus was determined to be the 
coronavirus. 
I said: How long for a vaccine? 
They both said: A minimum of 2 
years, probably 3 or 4. 
The pharmaceutical drug industry 
did it in less than a year. God bless 
them. 
So I don’t mean to criticize them. I 
understand they have research costs, 
and I understand they have marketing 
costs, and I certainly understand that 
the health insurance delivery system 
and the market itself is opaque. God, 
how did we design such a system? I 
yearn for the day—we all do—when we 
have a healthcare delivery system for 
pharmaceutical drugs that looks like 
somebody designed it on purpose. 
I have spent a lot of time—I certainly 
don’t pretend to be an expert—re-
searching the problem surrounding the 
cost of insulin, and everybody blames 
everybody else. The pharmaceutical 
drug companies blame the PBMs. The 
PBMs blame the insurance companies. 
They all blame each other. Some of 
them blame the doctors. Some of them 
blame patients for whining. You know, 
at some point, you say: Gosh. You 
know, it is almost as if you are inten-
tionally making it opaque, and that is 
a big part of our health insurance mar-
ket problem. 
I was reading an article the other 
day, and this is on a slightly different 
subject. As you know, the Trump ad-
ministration issued an Executive order 
saying hospitals have to post their 
prices. The hospitals sued, and the gov-
ernment won. So now the hospitals 
have to post their prices. 
The Wall Street Journal did a very 
interesting investigative piece. It real-
ly was a fine piece of work in this post- 
journalism, pay-to-play world that we 
live in. It looked at the websites of all 
of the major hospitals throughout the 
United States, and it found, I think—I 
don’t remember the number—over 100 
that had implemented or put it on 
their websites’ software so that the 
posted prices for their services that 
they offered, which the Executive order 
required, were there on the websites, 
but you just couldn’t see it, and con-
sumers couldn’t find it. Those who 
could find it had to go through about 10 
different layers to get to it. When the 
Wall Street Journal contacted the hos-
pitals, they said: Oh, whoops. It is just 
a software mistake. We will get it 
fixed. 
So the market is opaque. 
Look, some of my colleagues are 
going to oppose this bill, and I under-
stand their point of view in their say-
ing: Kennedy, this is price-fixing. We 
thought you were a free market guy. I 
am. I am. I don’t want to have to do 
this, but we have been talking about 
this problem for years, and it just 
keeps getting worse and worse and 
worse. 
I think the Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate—the most interesting group of peo-
ple I have ever been around—are intel-
ligent enough to understand nuance. 
They understand that this is price-fix-
ing, but they also understand this ar-
gument of, well, you are going down a 
slippery slope. No, we are not. There is 
nothing in this bill that says we have 
to go down a slippery slope. I think 
most fair-minded people understand 
that insulin, as a biologic, pharma-
ceutical drug, is unique. We are not 
talking about a drug that the pharma-
ceutical industry has spent hundreds of 
billions of dollars developing and has 
taken on extraordinary risk. This is a 
product that has been around since 
1920. It is virtually unchanged. It costs 
10 bucks a vial to produce. There is vir-
tually no risk, none whatsoever. It 
hasn’t changed much in 100 years, and 
people have to have it. The costs were 
recouped long ago. 
I am not accusing anybody of any-
thing, but I think a big part of the 
problem is the fact that three compa-
nies have a monopoly, and there is no 
generic because some people engage in 
what is called evergreening, which is a 
very clever way devised by the patent 
lawyers to keep patents from ever run-
ning out. I am just tired of holding 
hearings and issuing press releases and 
talking to the press about it and then 
doing nothing. 
I will just say—and I am going to end 
because I know Senator CRAPO
has 
something he wants to say, and I want 
to hear him—that I really struggled 
with this. I guess I am being incon-
sistent, because I do believe in the free 
market. I don’t believe in having the 
government set prices, but I don’t 
know what else to do. 
I don’t think we are going down a 
slippery slope. Insulin is unique. We 
have all got good pairs of L.L. Bean 
and other boots to keep us from going 
down that slippery slope. There is no 
law that says the U.S. Senate can’t 
consider issues on an ad hoc basis. Sen-
ators understand nuance, and in any 
event, I would rather be right than 
consistent. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 1132, introduced earlier 
today. I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object, first of all, I 
want to respond to Senator KENNEDY. 
The first thing I want to say to Sen-
ator KENNEDY is that I am impressed. 
He did this in only five pages. I wish we 
could all learn to write our legislation

S1956 
April 15, 2021 
in five pages or less. I don’t disagree 
with the history Senator KENNEDY 
went through, with his powerful dec-
laration, in that this is a critical issue 
that we must deal with, and I don’t dis-
agree with the fact that we have to 
have some serious pressure built here 
in the U.S. Congress to get this over 
the finish line. 
That being said, I think we just got 
this language last night, and what Sen-
ator KENNEDY is asking us to do today 
is to bypass the committee and go im-
mediately to the floor with his lan-
guage. There are several reasons I am 
going to have to, ultimately, object to 
that. 
The first is that he is correct. I and 
a number of my colleagues who would 
be here if I were not standing here have 
a real problem with the solution, the 
mechanism, that Senator KENNEDY has 
chosen—just outright price-fixing. Sen-
ator KENNEDY doesn’t even try to deny 
that. It goes beyond imposing govern-
ment regulatory price controls in gov-
ernment-run 
programs 
by 
going 
through the private market as well. 
That is a solution mechanism that I 
have opposed and many of my col-
leagues oppose in terms of dealing with 
this issue. That is one of the key rea-
sons for my objection. 
The other one, though, is that the 
Committee on Finance, of which I am 
the ranking member, is working on 
this. I know that this is not an answer, 
because the Committee on Finance has 
been working on this now for a year or 
2 or more, but there is work underway 
in a number of different arenas to try 
to get a handle on how to solve this 
without having to take the drastic step 
of just having the government come in 
and take control over the private sec-
tor market. 
I will just point to, for example, what 
happened under the Trump administra-
tion in just the last couple of years. 
Through the Trump administration’s 
effort to try to deal with this, a dem-
onstration project has been operating 
under Medicare Part D in which the ef-
fort was to try to get the monthly cost 
of insulin down to $35 a month, and 
they have had some success in that 
program to demonstrate how it can be 
accomplished. 
Now, look. I get that Medicare Part 
D is different than private sector insur-
ance and that it is different than Med-
icaid and that it is different than other 
pieces of our healthcare system; it is 
also different than CHIP, but in one 
sector, a pretty significant sector, we 
have some solutions that are starting 
to show real potential. 
In addition, as Senator KENNEDY 
knows, I drafted legislation in the last 
Congress and am working on that legis-
lation in this Congress that will deal 
not just with insulin but with many 
different other pieces of drug pricing in 
our system. 
I can tell you that Senator WYDEN 
himself, my counterpart on the Demo-
cratic side on the Finance Committee, 
has been working on his own ideas, and 
he and I have been working hard to 
prioritize this to get to a solution in 
the committee. I know, as I talked to 
Senator WYDEN just before I came to 
the floor, that Senator WYDEN and I 
both welcome the opportunity to work 
with Senator KENNEDY as we try to put 
together that bipartisan solution. 
I know that there would be other 
Senators on the other side of this issue 
who would stand here if I were not 
today and say they don’t like this solu-
tion because they want it to go further 
in the other direction. They want to 
see a complete government takeover of 
the entire market and move to a sin-
gle-payer system, that single payer 
being the government. That is another 
thing that some on my side have been 
working hard not to have happen. 
There is a lot of political controversy 
over what the mechanism must be, and 
that is the primary reason I want this 
to be able to be worked on in the com-
mittee, in the proper way that we man-
age legislation in the Senate. I commit 
to Senator KENNEDY that he can be as 
engaged as he wants to be with us in 
that as we move forward, but it is not 
the time right now to come and bypass 
that whole process. 
I think Senator KENNEDY would prob-
ably make a very powerful rejoinder 
that we have heard that we are work-
ing on it a lot and we need to now get 
to the point where we put solutions 
here on the floor for the entire Senate 
to consider, but today is not the day to 
do it by a unanimous consent request, 
and for that purpose I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my 
colleague, the Senator from Idaho, 
knows how much I respect him, and I 
certainly appreciate the invitation to 
work with him and his committee, and 
I intend to do that. 
And I know that the Senator didn’t 
say this, but I don’t believe in govern-
ment-run healthcare. But we have a 
discrete problem here and a very 
unique situation that can be addressed. 
This is not a biologic, as I said earlier, 
that costs hundreds of millions of dol-
lars to develop. This is insulin, and a 
lot of Americans need it or they will 
die. 
There is a monopoly, and there are 
efforts that have been made to main-
tain that monopoly, and my people in 
Louisiana—I 
know 
the 
people 
in 
Idaho—many of them feel the same 
way, and that is why they applaud Sen-
ator CRAPO’s efforts, but they are hurt-
ing. 
You can die without insulin. You can 
die. And it costs 10 bucks a vial to 
make, and it has been around 100 years, 
and now it costs 375 bucks. And all you 
have to do is walk across the border 
into Canada, and you can buy it for 50 
bucks. 
The market is being manipulated. I 
know it is complicated, and I under-
stand politics. I have been around it a 
good portion of my life, but this is an 
issue where we need to stop—we need 
to stop—talking about it, strutting 
around, issuing press releases, holding 
hearings, and doing nothing. 
I don’t want to price fix. I don’t. It 
makes me real uncomfortable to be 
proposing this, but I don’t know what 
else to do. There comes a point where 
patience—where patience—ceases to be 
a virtue. 
And here is what I know. I mean, the 
bill has been objected to, and I appre-
ciate it. You pass a bill like this or a 
similar bill like this; you are going to 
see a solution pretty fast. You are 
going to see a solution real fast. You 
are going to see some—this opaque 
market react with new energy. They 
are going to be running around like 
hounds from hell, trying to keep this 
from becoming the law, and that is 
why we need to hit this head-on. 
But with that, I thank the President 
for his attention, and I thank my col-
league for his eloquent remarks. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary Com-
mittee being tied on the question of re-
porting, I move to discharge the Senate 
Judiciary Committee from further con-
sideration of the nomination of Vanita 
Gupta, of Virginia, to be Associate At-
torney General. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders, or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to ask the Chair for clarification. 
It is my understanding there is 4 hours 
of debate, evenly divided between the 
Democrats and Republicans, on the dis-
charge petition. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, be-
tween the leaders or their designees. 
Mr. DURBIN. And either side can 
yield back; is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 
correct. 
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. 
Mr. President, let me be the first to 
rise today on our side and say that I 
am in strong support of the nomination 
of Vanita Gupta to be the Associate 
Attorney General. 
The Justice Department has not had 
a Senate-confirmed Associate Attorney 
General in over 3 years because Presi-
dent Trump never put forward a nomi-
nee. The No. 3 position in the Depart-
ment of Justice has been virtually va-
cant of a Senate-confirmed nominee for 
3 years. 
That position, by definition, oversees 
the Department’s civil litigation com-
ponents. This is no small deal. It is a 
big deal. The Department of Justice 
needs and deserves to have full leader-
ship in place. 
Vanita Gupta will be the first woman 
of color and the very first civil rights 
attorney to serve as Associate Attor-
ney General. This historic nominee is 
also exceptionally well qualified. She is 
a veteran of the Justice Department. 
She has a proven record of working 
across political and ideological lines to 
uphold the rule of law in a nonpartisan 
fashion. I don’t believe President Biden 
could have picked a better nominee. 
Vanita Gupta first joined the Justice 
Department shortly after the shooting 
death of Michael Brown by a police of-
ficer in Ferguson, MO. I remember it. I 
am sure many of my colleagues do as 
well. It was a difficult moment for 
many. As the head of the Department’s 
Civil 
Rights 
Division, 
Ms. 
Gupta 
worked closely with all of the stake-
holders involved in police reform: com-
munity leaders, civil rights leaders, 
and law enforcement. 
Not only did Ms. Gupta implement 
meaningful reforms in Ferguson, MO, 
and other cities, but she did so by help-
ing to repair the relationship between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve. Can you think of a better 
qualification at this moment in time in 
our history? 
Sadly, in recent days, our Nation has 
been rocked by controversial police 
shootings. Vanita Gupta is exactly the 
type of person we need at the Justice 
Department at this very moment. One 
strong piece of evidence is the incred-
ibly broad range of support her nomi-
nation has received. When you say the 
words ‘‘civil rights lawyer,’’ you say, 
‘‘Oh, way off on the left. I will bet she 
is out of touch with reality.’’ 
Not so. It is not just the civil rights 
groups that support her. Her nomina-
tion has the support of virtually every 
major law enforcement organization in 
the country. I want to repeat that be-
cause in the ensuing several hours, 
when we will discuss the discharge of 
her nomination, there will be asser-
tions made which do not acknowledge 
the obvious. 
Vanita Gupta has the support of vir-
tually every major law enforcement or-
ganization in the country, including 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association, the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association, and the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police, just to name a few. 
I can read numerous quotes from law 
enforcement 
groups 
praising 
Ms. 
Gupta. I am going to read one. In a let-
ter to the Senate, David Mahoney, 
President of the National Sheriffs’ As-
sociation, said: 
‘‘I strongly believe that Ms. Gupta is 
exactly the type of leader who is need-
ed in the Justice Department today. 
She 
possesses 
immense 
credibility 
among law enforcement leaders and 
community leaders.’’ 
Immense credibility, with both law 
enforcement and community leaders. 
Isn’t that exactly the type of person we 
need in the Department of Justice at 
this moment in history? 
It comes as no surprise when you 
look back on her background. Through-
out her career, Ms. Gupta has worked 
across the partisan divide, forming 
broad coalitions to get things done 
when people said it was impossible. A 
great example of this is criminal jus-
tice reform. Over a number of years, 
Vanita Gupta partnered with numerous 
conservatives—certifiable, 
reported 
conservatives. Let me give you a cou-
ple names: Grover Norquist; Mark Hol-
den, the former general counsel of 
Koch Industries. 
These efforts helped lay the ground-
work for the passage of the FIRST 
STEP Act, a bill which I worked on 
with Senator GRASSLEY, Senator LEE, 
Senator WHITEHOUSE, Senator CORNYN, 
a number of Democrats, CORY BOOKER 
included. We put together a bipartisan 
bill, signed into law by the President of 
the United States. 
Vanita Gupta was part of that effort. 
She knew how to put Republicans and 
Democrats at the table and come up 
with a reasonable compromise. Isn’t 
that exactly what we need at this mo-
ment in history? 
The Judiciary Committee has re-
ceived so many letters from Repub-
licans supporting Ms. Gupta’s nomina-
tion that I only have time to scratch 
the surface. Former Republican Con-
gressman Tom Coleman, whom I served 
with in the House, put it very well. He 
represented Missouri’s Sixth Congres-
sional District for 16 years. He under-
stood the challenge of Ferguson, and he 
understands 
the 
record 
of 
Vanita 
Gupta. Here is what he wrote: ‘‘Ms. 
Gupta is a person who seeks the com-
mon good, without concern for partisan 
gamesmanship.’’ 
He added: ‘‘I urge you, my former 
colleagues, to recognize the truth with 
respect to Vanita Gupta: She is an 
ideal public servant. She possesses wis-
dom and an ability to work across par-
tisan lines.’’ 
Ms. Gupta has spent her career fight-
ing to uphold the rule of law, almost 
always on behalf of those who had lit-
tle power or little money. In her pre-
vious tenure at the Justice Depart-
ment, Vanita Gupta undertook criti-
cally important work. In addition to 
police reform, she led efforts to pros-
ecute human trafficking, combat reli-
gious discrimination, and protect the 
rights of servicemembers to ensure 
that they didn’t have to be worried 
about being taken advantage of finan-
cially while they were protecting our 
Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1958 
April 15, 2021 
More recently, during her tenure at 
the Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights, Ms. Gupta led initia-
tives on voting rights, criminal justice 
reform, and the census. 
Ms. Gupta began her career as a civil 
rights lawyer with the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. One of 
the first matters she worked on as a 
young attorney involved nearly 40 
wrongfully convicted individuals in the 
small town of Tulia, TX. The individ-
uals who had been wrongfully con-
victed were almost all African Ameri-
cans, and they had been convicted of 
drug charges based solely on the false 
testimony of one corrupt, blatantly 
racist undercover police officer. 
How about walking into that situa-
tion, trying to resolve that situation. 
She did. Despite being completely in-
nocent, these individuals were sitting 
in jail, and their appeals had been re-
jected. Vanita Gupta took their case 
anyway. 
As a result of her work, not only 
were these individuals exonerated, but 
they received pardons from the Repub-
lican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, 
and Texas eventually paid out a $6 mil-
lion settlement. That is nothing short 
of a political miracle, and she achieved 
it by hard work, being smart as can be, 
and reaching out to both sides to find 
some area of agreement. 
Ms. Gupta’s commitment to ensure 
the equal protection of the law has 
been praised by Republicans and Demo-
crats alike. Michael Chertoff, former 
Secretary of Homeland Security under 
President George Bush, said about Ms. 
Vanita Gupta in a letter to the Senate. 
‘‘She is a relentless advocate for fair-
ness and the rule of law.’’ 
How would you like to have that as 
the lead sentence of your legal biog-
raphy: ‘‘a relentless advocate for fair-
ness and the rule of law.’’ How would 
we like to have a person like that in 
this administration, in the Department 
of Justice? Obviously, we would jump 
at the chance. 
She is the right person at the right 
time. She will bring experience, dedica-
tion, and a nonpartisan approach to 
the role of Associate Attorney General, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
her nomination. 
Now, if you heard what I just said 
about Vanita Gupta, you might think: 
Why was this a tie vote in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee? First, it is an 
evenly divided committee: 11 Demo-
crats, 11 Republicans. And there are a 
lot of things going on, on both sides of 
the table, when it comes to the final 
vote on nominees like this. 
Several Republicans told me they 
might be leaning in her direction but 
they couldn’t vote for her in the com-
mittee. I hope they will reconsider 
when it comes to the floor. 
And there was another thing going on 
too. Rightwing groups were spending 
millions—millions—of dollars on tele-
vision in Washington trying to attack 
the reputation and character of Vanita 
Gupta. 
I think I have made it clear. Vanita 
Gupta is highly qualified and historic, 
with broad support from law enforce-
ment and civil rights organizations, ad-
vocates across the political spectrum. 
She, clearly, on the merits, will be an 
outstanding Associate Attorney Gen-
eral. 
But every step of the way, her de-
tractors have tried to delay and ob-
struct her nomination. We saw that in 
our Judiciary Committee markup on 
March 25. I allowed committee Repub-
licans to speak for 94 minutes about 
Ms. Gupta’s nomination at markup. 
One Senator from Texas spoke for 29 
minutes himself. I didn’t cut him off. 
But someone on the Republican side 
made the decision to invoke the 2-hour 
rule, a Senate rule that says that a 
committee cannot operate more than 2 
hours after the Senate comes into ses-
sion, to try to cut off the markup for 
the vote even before the vote. 
I had received assurances earlier that 
the 2-hour rule would not be invoked, 
but at 11:55, with barely 5 minutes to 
spare, I was told the other side had 
changed their mind. Just as the pre-
vious two chairs of the committee, 
Senators Graham and Grassley, had 
done in the past, I ended debate, not-
withstanding committee rule IV, and 
called for a vote on the nomination. 
I won’t go into a debate over com-
mittee rule IV other than to say it is a 
doomsday filibuster. Any Senator can 
object to the business in the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee and virtually stop 
all proceedings indefinitely. There is 
no recourse. 
I gave Republicans ample time to 
make their arguments in the com-
mittee. I was prepared to give them 
even more time until the 2-hour rule 
was invoked. But someone on the other 
side decided to force my hand. I had to 
act quickly. 
I told Republicans in writing in a 
March 24 letter that we would hold a 
vote on Ms. Gupta’s nomination the 
next day, and I meant it. In the future, 
I would be happy to limit the number 
of minutes that Senators can speak in 
order for all Senators to have an oppor-
tunity, but at this moment in time, we 
have to accept the obvious. 
Vanita Gupta has been subjected to 
blatantly false attacks from many 
rightwingers and conservative, dark 
money groups. Republicans have false-
ly claimed that she supports defunding 
the police. Be prepared. You are going 
to hear this mantra again and again. 
In reality, Gupta has the support of 
virtually every major law enforcement 
organization in America. Republicans 
have made false claims about Gupta’s 
position on drugs. For example, the 
senior Senator from Texas alleged that 
Gupta previously advocated, ‘‘All drugs 
should be legal.’’ In reality, Vanita 
Gupta has never advocated that all 
drugs should be legal. As the senior 
Senator from Texas knows, Gupta did 
write, 9 years ago, that she favored de-
criminalizing the ‘‘simple possession’’ 
of ‘‘small amounts’’ of marijuana and 
other drugs. 
Take a look at what we have done 
with sentencing and drug crimes in 
America, even under the Trump admin-
istration. 
At her hearing, Ms. Gupta was com-
pletely forthright in explaining that 
she changed her mind over the years in 
terms of decriminalizing drug posses-
sion, due in part to a family experience 
with opioid addiction. 
Republicans 
have 
criticized 
Ms. 
Gupta’s past statements on Twitter, 
despite the fact that they strongly sup-
ported President Donald Trump and 
many of his nominees, many of whom 
were just White males, who made such 
harsh statements in speeches and so-
cial media posts that they were leg-
endary. 
Republicans have argued that Gupta 
is radical and dangerous. In reality, 
Vanita Gupta has a career-long record 
of working closely with conservatives, 
business leaders and community lead-
ers and law enforcement. That is why 
she has the support of so many promi-
nent Republican leaders now. 
I am looking forward to voting for 
her and to watching her serve in the 
Department of Justice. She will follow 
the trail that she set in her legal ca-
reer, looking for solutions, bringing us 
together. Can you think of a moment 
in history in this country when we 
needed that more? I can’t. 
Every day we have these conflicting 
stories coming at us, from the courts 
in Minnesota on a question of George 
Floyd and the culpability for his death 
to a situation here in the Capitol, 
where we are honoring law enforce-
ment when Officer Billy Evans of the 
Capitol Hill Police gave his life serving 
this country. 
We are torn trying to find the right 
combination for law enforcement that 
is sensible and principled and humane. 
We need someone like Vanita Gupta at 
the table in the Department of Justice, 
leading. I hope her critics will have 
second thoughts. 
Give this outstanding woman an op-
portunity to serve her country even 
more than she has in the past. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The Senator from Utah. 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, right 
now, I just want to speak about the 
motion to discharge as opposed to 
whether people should vote for or 
against Gupta. 
I am opposed to this effort to dis-
charge Gupta from the Judiciary Com-
mittee. In fact, it is not properly in 
order. In theory, we are moving this 
nomination because it failed in Com-
mittee by an even, tie vote. But that 
vote should never have been called, and 
it was improper when it was. 
Under the committee rules, members 
have a right to unlimited debate. This 
can only be stopped either by a bipar-
tisan vote to end debate under the 
rules or by a vote of the majority of 
the committee to set a time certain to 
vote under precedent. Because Repub-
licans at Ms. Gupta’s markup wanted

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1959 
April 15, 2021 
to talk, there couldn’t have been a bi-
partisan vote to end debate. In fact, 
some, like my colleagues from North 
Carolina, didn’t have a chance to speak 
and were still waiting their turn. And 
because the Democrats don’t have a 
majority 
in 
the 
committee, 
they 
couldn’t have set a time certain. 
Under the rules and precedents of the 
committee, then, they had to let Re-
publicans talk, and if it took more 
than one markup, so be it. The Demo-
crats did this talkathon when I was 
chairman. During our second markup 
of 2017, in order to delay Senator Ses-
sions’ nomination to be Attorney Gen-
eral, Democrats filibustered in the Ju-
diciary Committee. When it happened, 
I didn’t interrupt anyone or break any 
rules. I simply continued the markup 
the next day, checking to see who 
would want to be recognized and for 
how long. 
The fact is that the Democrats fre-
quently used these filibuster tactics 
against us over the past 4 years. We 
simply dealt with them from a position 
of confidence in the rules and prece-
dents of our committee. Sometimes 
being chairman and moving nominees 
takes hard work, but we did the job we 
needed to do. 
That is not what happened in the dis-
cussion of Gupta. Instead, my col-
league from Arkansas was interrupted 
and the roll was called while he was 
still speaking. 
This was not the power of the major-
ity being used. It was the power of the 
chairman. What is the point of having 
rules if you can just ignore them—just 
ignore them when you find yourself 
dealing with an unfamiliar situation. 
So I don’t think the even vote—the 
tie vote—in committee even properly 
happened. As far as I am concerned, 
Senator COTTON had the floor. That 
rollcall vote was illegitimate under 
committee rules, and so the one that 
we are going to have in the Senate this 
afternoon is just as illegitimate. 
And why did the Chairman scrap the 
committee rules for this nominee? This 
isn’t a Supreme Court nomination. The 
nominee is a sub-Cabinet official at the 
Justice Department. So I have to won-
der why. I think it is because the 
Democrats know how really powerful 
she will be in the Justice Department. 
As Judge Garland told us during his 
hearing, he didn’t pick Ms. Gupta. He 
only got to know her after they were 
both picked. That is quite a position 
for a subordinate to be in. 
The late Congressman Dingell fa-
mously said this—and I will clean it up 
a bit: ‘‘You let me write the precedent, 
and I’ll [beat] . . . you every time.’’ 
The Judiciary Committee has done 
him one better: Now there is no proce-
dure. 
If the rules are not respected, the 
Senate is an institution that loses 
every time. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no and 
protect the traditions of the body. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don’t 
know that there is another Republican 
Senator that I have worked with as 
much and as effectively and with as 
much 
pleasure 
as 
Senator 
CHUCK 
GRASSLEY of Iowa—and I mean it. We 
have done some good things together. 
We sometimes started off in opposing 
positions and tried to find some com-
mon ground. The First Step Act was a 
good illustration of that, but it is not 
the only demonstration, and I trust 
that there will be more. I am sorry we 
disagree today. 
Two points I will make. Rule 4, as de-
scribed by Senator GRASSLEY, is vir-
tually, as I mentioned earlier, a dooms-
day filibuster. There is just no way out 
of it, particularly with an evenly di-
vided committee. I am not the first to 
discover that as chairman. 
I will make as part of the RECORD, 
and I am going to share with my col-
league from Iowa, the four or five in-
stances 
when 
previous 
Republican 
chairs of the committee did exactly 
what I did with this nomination and 
said: We are moving forward; we are 
not going to pay attention to rule 4. 
Senator GRAHAM, Senator GRASSLEY, 
and others have done just exactly that 
in the past. So I think we adopted that 
as a rule because it was already in the 
rules, and we were evenly tied in com-
mittee. But it sure ties the hands of a 
chairman or anyone who is trying to 
accomplish anything if there is one 
person who just stands and objects and 
objects and objects. It is a very dif-
ficult situation. 
The second thing I will mention is— 
I am going to make this a part of the 
RECORD, and I don’t have it at hand as 
I stand here—the quote from Merrick 
Garland in his nomination hearing 
when someone raised the question 
about 
Vanita 
Gupta 
and 
Kristen 
Clarke, another nominee working her 
way through the committee. Merrick 
Garland may not have known either 
one of them personally beforehand. He 
could have, but I am not sure. But he 
made it abundantly clear that this is 
the team he wanted to manage the De-
partment of Justice—no ifs, ands, or 
buts about it. He totally committed 
and believed that each of them brought 
a perspective in the law and by their 
own legal experience valuable to him 
and the Department of Justice and to 
the Nation. So I don’t think there is 
any question that he is committed to 
Vanita Gupta, as he should be. 
I will yield back at this point. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia is recognized. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am 
sorry that I missed the incredibly 
thoughtful comments of the Demo-
cratic whip, who I think spoke on the 
topic—one of the topics—that I am 
going to speak about. 
I think I have 10 minutes. Is that 
right? 
OK. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Clarifica-
tion: The Senator may use whatever 
time he needs to. 
Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding 
Officer and thank the—I want to thank 
the brilliant ruling of the Parliamen-
tarian on that subject. 
Mr. DURBIN. Excuse me. If I can 
have a clarification. As I understand it, 
we are in measured time, 2 hours to a 
side. Any speakers on our side will be 
taken from that 2-hour total. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 
correct. 
Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want 
to touch on two critically important 
subjects that the Senate is considering 
today. First, I want to rise in support 
of Vanita Gupta, President Biden’s 
nominee to serve as the Associate At-
torney General, the third highest rank-
ing position in our Justice Depart-
ment. 
I think my good friend, the Senator 
from Illinois, has already spoken about 
Ms. Gupta. I want to make a personal 
note. First, that Vanita is a fellow Vir-
ginian. I am proud to say that she and 
her husband, Chinh Le, are raising 
their two sons in the Commonwealth. 
They live in Arlington. 
Ms. Gupta is also an outstanding pub-
lic servant. She served from 2014 to 2017 
as the Principal Deputy Assistant At-
torney General in the Civil Rights Di-
vision at DOJ. She led the Division, as 
the Acting Assistant Attorney General, 
until 2015. 
Since 2017, she has led one of the 
country’s preeminent civil rights orga-
nizations—the Leadership Conference 
for Civil and Human Rights. This 
means that, if confirmed, Ms. Gupta 
will be the first civil rights leader in 
any of the top three positions at Jus-
tice. 
The sheer depth and breadth of Ms. 
Gupta’s legal and professional experi-
ence makes her an outstanding selec-
tion to serve as the Associate Attorney 
General. Perhaps that is why Ms. 
Gupta’s supporters span the political 
spectrum. 
My understanding is that my friend, 
the Senator from Illinois, has already 
pointed out some of this broad-based 
bipartisan support. Let me elaborate 
on 
some 
of 
that 
support. 
Grover 
Norquist calls her an ‘‘honest broker’’ 
in his endorsement letter. 
Let me just state for the record that 
I have had interactions with Grover 
Norquist since before I was Governor, 
over 20 years, and Grover Norquist has 
never called me anything close to as 
nice as he called Vanita Gupta as an 
‘‘honest broker.’’ 
Mark Holden, the former general 
counsel of Koch Industries, writes: 
‘‘Ms. Gupta is an exceptional lawyer, 
and among the most talented lawyers I 
have worked with in my career.’’ 
Ms. Gupta has spent years and years 
collaborating with people from across 
the spectrum to promote a more fair 
and equal justice system. 
And let me note for the record, as 
well, that I have not always agreed 
with Ms. Gupta. I was very involved in

housing finance reform. Ms. Gupta, as 
chairman of the Conference on Civil 
Rights, had a different opinion, but I 
always respected her intellect and her 
willingness to listen to alternative 
views and her willingness to really dig 
into the facts. 
With that background as a civil 
rights leader in the thick of issues 
around policing, race, and criminal jus-
tice reform, she actually led the inves-
tigations of police departments in Fer-
guson, Chicago, and Baltimore. 
At the same time, I have a long list 
of law enforcement groups that are 
supporting Ms. Gupta’s nomination, in-
cluding the National Fraternal Order 
of Police. Again, in terms of the FOP, 
I think in all my career, one time they 
endorsed me. Again, her receiving that 
endorsement is different than myself 
and perhaps even the Senator from Illi-
nois. 
Ms. Gupta has also led broad-ranging 
and robust enforcement and education 
efforts to combat hate crimes, includ-
ing the first-ever prosecutions under 
the newly enacted Matthew Shepard 
and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Pre-
vention Act. 
Under 
her 
leadership, 
the 
Civil 
Rights Division trained local and Fed-
eral law enforcement throughout the 
country in recognizing, investigating, 
and proving hate crimes; in educating 
communities and engaging them in a 
process of ensuring public safety; and 
in encouraging better hate crime re-
porting and data collection. 
I would like to close on one other 
timely credential. As chairman of the 
Intelligence Committee, I have meticu-
lously chronicled the corrosive effects 
of disinformation and foreign inter-
ference into our elections—something 
the Presiding Officer is also a national 
leader on. 
Ms. Gupta has been a leading voice 
for election integrity, thoughtfully and 
firmly engaging social media platforms 
to address disinformation on their plat-
forms, as well as voter suppression, 
hate, division, and violence. 
Among the many important roles the 
Department of Justice has right now, 
securing our democracy itself is surely 
near the top of the list. 
Vanita Gupta is a person of extraor-
dinary ability. She has the right expe-
rience for this role, and I am honored 
to support her in her nomination today 
and hope that later today, we will get 
broad bipartisan support to move for-
ward that nomination. 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Mr. President, this may be a transfer 
to a second subject, which actually 
goes a little bit in concert with talking 
about Vanita Gupta, and that is rising 
in support of the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act and the Jabara-Heyer NO 
HATE Act. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, our 
Nation has witnessed a surge in racism, 
xenophobia, and violence against Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. In 
fact, between March of last year and 
February of this year, there were near-
ly 3,800 hate incidents targeting Asian 
Americans. It should go without saying 
that these actions have no place in our 
communities. 
To address this spike in anti-Asian 
rhetoric and hate crimes, we must 
stand in solidarity with the AAPI com-
munity, and we must act against these 
heinous crimes. The COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act helps address this crisis 
head-on. 
This bill, very simply, requires At-
torney General Garland to designate a 
coordinator within the Department of 
Justice to expedite, review, and facili-
tate reporting of COVID–19 related 
hate crimes. Further, it requires the 
DOJ to issue guidance to State and 
local law enforcement, to equip them 
with the tools needed to deal with the 
disturbing surge in incidents targeting 
the AAPI community. 
It is tragic but not surprising that 
hate crimes in America have always 
been critically underreported. In fact, 
reports released by the Department of 
Justice in recent years suggest that 
the majority of hate crimes are not 
even reported—not even reported. 
Our 
current 
patchwork 
system, 
paired with inconsistent reporting and 
resources, guarantees that many in-
stances of hate-related violence and 
crimes go uncounted. Not only does 
this mask the true scale of hate inci-
dents across our Nation, it also means 
that investigative resources and sup-
port structures may not be available to 
victims who need it. 
This problem can be exacerbated by 
cultural and language barriers and 
made even worse by the pandemic, 
which has made it more difficult for 
folks to get connected with reporting 
mechanisms or useful resources. Fortu-
nately, the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
seeks to address these challenges by 
providing a clearinghouse for these 
cases. 
Over the past decade, our Nation has 
seen a steady rise in hate crimes. 
Groups and individuals targeting mi-
nority and religious groups have in-
creasingly perpetrated sickening acts 
of violence fueled by hateful ideologies. 
We saw that here on January 6. We 
also saw it earlier in my State, in Vir-
ginia. In Charlottesville, back in 2017, 
we saw this hate and violence on our 
streets when a White supremacist 
drove a car through a group of peaceful 
protesters, injuring many and killing a 
young woman named Heather Heyer. 
It is critical that we give our law en-
forcement the tools they need to curb 
these horrific acts. That is why, on a 
related item, I am also cosponsor of the 
bipartisan Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act. 
My hope is that it will be offered as an 
amendment to the COVID–19 bill that 
we hopefully will be addressing shortly. 
This bill modernizes our reporting 
system for hate crimes so that we can 
respond to accurate data. It also pro-
vides grants to establish hate crime 
hotlines, to record information about 
hate crimes, and to redirect victims 
and witnesses to law enforcement and 
local support services as needed. Fi-
nally, this bill provides a Federal pri-
vate right of action for hate crime vic-
tims and allows judges to sentence 
community-specific 
education 
and 
community service. Together, these 
changes create a new model for ad-
dressing these crimes and preventing 
them 
from 
going 
unreported 
or 
unpunished. 
Both the COVID–19 Hate Crime Act 
and the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act 
are straightforward pieces of legisla-
tion that give victims and law enforce-
ment officers the tools they des-
perately need to tackle the increasing 
prevalence of hate incidents in our 
country. I hope that we move quickly 
on both these pieces of legislation in 
major bipartisan fashion. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

KING). The Senator from Arkansas. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Vanita 
Gupta is President Biden’s nominee to 
be Associate Attorney General. She is 
unfit for that role. She is unfit because 
of her radical view that every single 
American and every single institution 
in the United States is inherently rac-
ist. She is unfit because she lacks the 
temperament to do the job, as evi-
denced by her relentless attacks on the 
integrity and character of judges and 
Senators alike, seemingly anytime she 
had a mere disagreement with them. 
She is certainly unfit based on her at-
tempts to mislead the Senate in her 
Judiciary Committee hearing. 
Ms. Gupta has been before the com-
mittee many times as a partisan advo-
cate. There is nothing wrong with that, 
but her past appearances do give us a 
glimpse of what she believes when she 
isn’t seeking our votes for confirma-
tion. 
Less than a year ago, June of last 
year, she came before the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee to testify on police 
reform. When she was asked ‘‘Do you 
believe all Americans are racist?’’ she 
replied under oath ‘‘Yes, I do.’’ Think 
about that. The person nominated by 
Joe Biden to oversee, among other 
things, the Federal Government’s civil 
rights enforcement says that she be-
lieves every single American is racist. 
This preposterous idea that anyone 
and everyone is inherently racist is at 
the core of the pernicious ideology 
pushed by the left called ‘‘critical race 
theory.’’ But this position was not an 
anomaly, a misstatement, or a new po-
sition for Mrs. Gupta. In 2005, she pub-
lished an article in the Fordham Law 
Review on what she called ‘‘Critical 
Race Lawyering.’’ In that article, Ms. 
Gupta argued that ‘‘the rule of law’’ 
and ‘‘equal justice for all’’ and ‘‘equal 
protection’’ aren’t the great bulwarks 
of 
our 
liberty, 
aren’t 
the 
single 
achievements of our Republic and our 
constitutional form of government, but 
instead ‘‘code words’’—that is what she 
called them—for some kind of twisted 
racism. Anyone who thinks that the 
rule of law or equal justice for all or

April 15, 2021 
equal protection are simply ‘‘code 
words’’ for racism is unfit for any posi-
tion in our government but especially a 
position of leadership in the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
The concerns with Ms. Gupta’s nomi-
nation are not limited to extreme 
views on these topics. Ms. Gupta has 
made a career over the last few years 
on social media attacking the char-
acter and integrity of Federal judges, 
judicial nominees, and Members of the 
Senate. She accused four different ju-
rists currently on the Supreme Court 
of being liars, extremists, ‘‘dangerous,’’ 
or 
‘‘opposed 
to 
civil 
and 
human 
rights.’’ She must have had a macro; 
she just hit a shortcut button that said 
‘‘opposed to civil and human rights.’’ 
By my count, she has leveled incen-
diary attacks on the integrity and 
character of around 50 currently sit-
ting Federal judges. It could be more. I 
may have lost count when it got so 
high. I asked her about these attacks. 
While she said during her hearings that 
she ‘‘regrets’’ some of her rhetoric, she 
steadfastly refused to renounce these 
attacks on those judges. 
Ms. Gupta has leveled similarly caus-
tic comments against Members of this 
body, posting online that dozens of 
Members 
of 
the 
Senate 
are—you 
guessed 
it—‘‘opposed 
to 
civil 
and 
human rights.’’ She accused one of our 
colleagues of being ‘‘a disgrace,’’ an-
other of being a ‘‘hypocrite,’’ and an-
other of ‘‘failing her constituents.’’ At 
one point, she commented: ‘‘How many 
of us are done with SUSAN COLLINS’s 
concerns?’’ 
I want to be clear. Disagreement 
with or even deep dislike for Members 
of the Senate is not disqualifying for 
any position in the Federal Govern-
ment. People are entitled to have their 
opinions. They are entitled to have 
their political views. But honestly, the 
Associate Attorney General of the 
United States must be able to effec-
tively represent the United States in 
court while also working with Congress 
on important issues. It might be hard 
to represent the United States in court 
when you have accused dozens of Fed-
eral judges of being ‘‘opposed to human 
and civil rights’’ or being a ‘‘disgrace’’ 
or a ‘‘liar.’’ Likewise, I wonder what 
Senator COLLINS thinks about Vanita 
Gupta being done with her concerns. 
Perhaps most concerning, though, is 
that Ms. Gupta repeatedly misled the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
under 
oath. 
Every single Republican member of the 
Judiciary Committee joined a letter on 
March 23 outlining some of her most 
blatant misrepresentations that she 
made during her hearing, and we asked 
the chairman of the committee for a 
second 
hearing. 
That 
request 
was 
promptly refused. 
Mr. President, I asked unanimous 
consent that the March 23 letter be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, March 23, 2021. 
Hon. RICHARD DURBIN, 
Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN: On March 9, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing 
to consider the nominations of Lisa Monaco, 
nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of 
the United States, and Vanita Gupta, nomi-
nee to be Associate Attorney General of the 
United States. While under oath, Vanita 
Gupta misled the Committee on at least four 
issues: (l) Her support for eliminating quali-
fied immunity; (2) her support for decrimi-
nalizing all drugs; (3) her support for 
defunding the police; and (4) her death pen-
alty record. Unfortunately, in her responses 
a week later to our written questions, Ms. 
Gupta was no more forthcoming. In some 
cases, she doubled down on her misleading 
statements from the hearing, and in others 
she refused to answer altogether. In ‘‘re-
sponse’’ to scores of our questions, she mere-
ly copied-and-pasted the same inapplicable, 
general statements for one question after an-
other. 
We urge you to immediately schedule a 
second hearing with Ms. Gupta so that she 
can answer for her misleading statements, 
and for her refusal to respond to our written 
questions. Indeed, Ms. Gupta herself asked 
for similar measures in the context of past 
nominees. On November 20, 2017, Ms. Gupta 
issued an open letter in which she wrote 
that, as a result of what she described as 
‘‘credible evidence’’ that two nominees were 
not 
forthcoming 
with 
the 
Committee, 
‘‘Chairman Grassley must put politics aside 
and bring back both nominees before the 
committee so that they can be asked about 
their truthfulness under oath. Failure to do 
so would abdicate the independent role of the 
Senate . . . If the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee is going to be taken seriously by this 
and future administrations, it must demand 
that 
nominees 
accurately 
respond 
to 
questions[.]’’ 
Ms. Gupta’s misleading statements to this 
Committee include, at minimum: 
1. HER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING QUALIFIED 
IMMUNITY 
During the hearing, Ms. Gupta was asked 
whether she supported eliminating the doc-
trine of qualified immunity. She responded 
that she doesn’t ‘‘support[ ] elimination one 
way or another.’’ 
In June 2020, Ms. Gupta testified before 
this Committee that ‘‘Congress should end 
qualified immunity in Section 1983 claims.’’ 
When pressed about her June 2020 testi-
mony before this Committee, Ms. Gupta 
claimed those were not her own opinions, but 
that she had been merely ‘‘representing the 
consensus views of the Civil Rights Coalition 
at the Leadership Conference.’’ But in June 
2020, she said, ‘‘I am pleased’’ (not that the 
Leadership Conference was ‘‘pleased’’) that 
reforms she had recommended, including the 
elimination of qualified immunity, were ‘‘in-
cluded in the newly introduced Justice in 
Policing Act of 2020.’’ 
Additionally, during the June 2020 hearing, 
when one of the other witnesses said that he 
believed qualified immunity should be elimi-
nated, Ms. Gupta added, ‘‘I agree.’’ 
2. HER SUPPORT FOR DECRIMINALIZING ALL 
DRUGS 
When asked whether she advocates for ‘‘de-
criminalization of all drugs,’’ Ms. Gupta an-
swered, unequivocally, ‘‘No, Senator, I do 
not.’’ 
Ms. Gupta doubled down on this misleading 
statement in response to written questions, 
writing that she had ‘‘never advocated for 
the decriminalization of all drugs.’’ 
In a September 2012 op-ed in the Huff-
ington Post, Ms. Gupta wrote that ‘‘States 
should decriminalize simple possession of all 
drugs, particularly marijuana, and for small 
amounts of other drugs.’’ This directly con-
tradicts Ms. Gupta’s answers. 
A member of the Committee pressed Ms. 
Gupta for explanation during the hearing, 
and referred to the September 2012 op-ed. Ms. 
Gupta answered, ‘‘Senator, I have advocated, 
as I believe President Biden has, for decrimi-
nalization of marijuana possession.’’ 
Later in the hearing, another member of 
the Committee followed up on the question 
by reading aloud Ms. Gupta’s statement from 
the 2012 op-ed, to which Ms. Gupta responded 
that she had only been ‘‘speaking for [her] 
position today.’’ But her answer had specifi-
cally referred to her past-tense advocacy 
when she stated she had only advocated for 
decriminalization of marijuana possession, 
and her written answers a week later explic-
itly claimed that she had ‘‘never’’ advocated 
for decriminalizing possession of all drugs. 
3. HER SUPPORT FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE 
During the hearing, Ms. Gupta repeatedly 
stated that she did not ‘‘support defunding 
the police.’’ She added, ‘‘I have, in fact, 
spent my career advocating where it’s been 
necessary for greater resources for law en-
forcement.’’ She later added that she had ad-
vocated for greater law enforcement re-
sources ‘‘at every point in [her] career.’’ 
These statements directly contradict her 
sworn testimony before this very Committee 
on June 16, 2020, where she said that leaders 
must ‘‘heed calls . . . to decrease police 
budgets and the scope, role, and responsi-
bility of police in our lives.’’ 
When pressed by a member of the Com-
mittee that her statement in June 2020 was, 
by any measure, advocating for defunding 
the 
police, 
Gupta 
responded 
that 
she 
‘‘disagree[d]’’ with that characterization. 
But Ms. Gupta used the same characteriza-
tion while speaking on a webinar just two 
days after her June 2020 testimony, saying, 
‘‘Localities have been overspending on crimi-
nal-justice system infrastructure and polic-
ing and divesting in housing, education, jobs, 
and healthcare. Some people call [changing 
this] ‘defunding the police,’ other people call 
it ‘divest/invest.’ ’’ 
The Washington Post—the same outlet 
that you cited in defense of Ms. Gupta’s 
nomination during a March 10 hearing on an-
other 
topic—correctly 
noted 
that 
Ms. 
Gupta’s June 2020 statement was ‘‘exactly 
what ‘defunding’ the police is all about. Now 
Gupta says she has never supported the 
idea.’’ 
A contemporaneous article by Reuters on 
June 8, 2020, also noted that ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ was a term ‘‘being used by activists to 
propose eliminating or cutting spending on 
police departments, often the largest ex-
pense for municipalities, and instead fun-
neling the money to programs for education, 
social welfare, housing, and other commu-
nity needs.’’ 
Any claim that Ms. Gupta was not aware 
that the policies she espouses are what other 
activists mean by ‘‘defunct the police,’’ di-
rectly contradicts how she described her own 
policies just months ago. 
4. HER DEATH PENALTY RECORD 
In response to a question about her prior 
statements against the death penalty, Ms. 
Gupta said that, while she had been an oppo-
nent of the death penalty, ‘‘I also know how 
to enforce the law. And I did so when I was 
in the Justice Department before, when 
Dylann Roof committed the heinous act 
against nine parishioners at the Charleston 
[Emanuel 
African 
Methodist 
Episcopal] 
Church. And that prosecution and conviction 
happened under my watch.’’ 
Ms. Gupta’s statement suggested that she 
had supported the application of the death

penalty in the Dylann Roof case because it 
met the requirements under the law, despite 
her personal feelings. That was not the case. 
Contemporaneous reporting by the Wash-
ington Post in 2016 noted that Attorney Gen-
eral Loretta Lynch approved prosecutors 
seeking the death penalty for Dylann Roof 
‘‘over the objections of some advising her, 
including . . . Vanita Gupta, the head of the 
Justice Department’s civil rights division.’’ 
What Ms. Gupta said was that the ‘‘pros-
ecution and conviction’’ of Dylann Roof, in-
cluding the application of the death penalty, 
‘‘happened under [her] watch.’’ She misled 
Senators by neglecting to say that it also 
happened over her objection. 
When asked about these contradictions in 
written questions, Ms. Gupta found a new 
way to avoid answering: She said it ‘‘would 
not be appropriate . . . to discuss’’ what she 
did at the Department of Justice, either on 
the Dylann Roof case ‘‘or on any other mat-
ter [she] worked on during [her] prior gov-
ernment experience.’’ 
Further, there remain significant ques-
tions about Ms. Gupta’s temperament, about 
which she refuses to answer even simple 
questions. During her hearing, multiple 
members of this Committee asked her about 
her harsh rhetoric and her attacks on the 
character and integrity of sitting federal 
judges and members of the Senate. In re-
sponse, she told the Committee that she ‘‘re-
grets’’ her rhetoric. Yet, in responses to 
written questions after the hearing, Ms. 
Gupta repeatedly and notably refused to re-
nounce her previous attacks, such as her 
prior assertions that four different jurists on 
the Supreme Court are liars, extremists, 
‘‘dangerous,’’ or ‘‘opposed to civil and human 
rights.’’ Instead, in response to written ques-
tions from multiple members about her at-
tacks on senators or the federal judiciary, 
Ms. Gupta chose to copy-and-paste more 
than 40 times a generalized statement that 
she has either ‘‘tremendous respect’’ or ‘‘im-
mense respect’’ for judges or for members of 
the United States Senate. 
Our call for a second hearing is not due to 
Ms. Gupta’s substantive views—either her 
longstanding views or her new ones claimed 
only since her nomination. It’s about her 
lack of candor with the Committee. If her 
answers at the hearing were misleading 
about her record, and in written questions 
she shifted her answers again or refused to 
answer at all, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee cannot perform its role to consider 
her nomination. 
The position of Associate Attorney Gen-
eral is the third-ranking position in the De-
partment of Justice. The Associate Attorney 
General oversees, among other things, the 
civil litigation and enforcement apparatus of 
the United States. It is critical that the As-
sociate Attorney General be someone who 
can be trusted to tell the truth. Further, the 
Senate must be able to trust that the testi-
mony of public officials under oath will be 
truthful and complete. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case with 
Ms. Gupta, and the Committee should imme-
diately schedule a second hearing. 
Sincerely, 
Chuck Grassley, Ranking Member, Com-
mittee on the Judiciary; John Cornyn, 
U.S. Senator; Ted Cruz, U.S. Senator; 
Josh Hawley, U.S. Senator; John Ken-
nedy, U.S. Senator; Marsha Blackburn, 
U.S. Senator; Lindsey O. Graham, U.S. 
Senator; Michael S. Lee, U.S. Senator; 
Ben Sasse, U.S. Senator; Tom Cotton, 
U.S. Senator; Thom Tillis, U.S. Sen-
ator. 
Mr. COTTON. Finally, Mr. President, 
I have to observe something inde-
pendent of Ms. Gupta herself. The dis-
charge petition filed today requires 
that there has been a valid, tied vote in 
committee. That is the rule we all 
agreed to in the beginning of this Con-
gress. Yet Ms. Gupta still has not re-
ceived a valid vote in the committee. 
In fact, during the markup of her nomi-
nation, just minutes into my 15-minute 
remarks, the chairman of the com-
mittee 
cut 
off 
my 
remarks 
midsentence and called for a vote, in 
violation of committee rules. I guess 
somehow allowing members to finish 
their statements, which are guaranteed 
under the committees rules, had some-
how 
become 
inconvenient 
for 
the 
scheduling preferences of our Demo-
cratic colleagues, or perhaps the com-
mittee’s meeting had been mismanaged 
and they were worried about the 2-hour 
rule. It wasn’t just me. My remarks 
were interrupted. At least one Repub-
lican Senator didn’t have an oppor-
tunity to speak at all. The Democrats 
simply broke the rules and voted out 
Ms. Gupta’s nomination—not in ac-
cordance with Judiciary Committee 
rules. 
There must be consequences when 
the Democrats break the rules. Here is 
what the consequences are going to be 
in this case. I will refuse consent or 
time agreements for the nomination of 
any U.S. attorney from any State rep-
resented by a Democrat on the Judici-
ary Committee. What we need to have 
is a valid vote in committee in accord-
ance with the committee rules, not 
ramming 
through 
this 
nomination 
today. 
Today we are faced not only with the 
choice of whether Ms. Gupta is fit to be 
the Associate Attorney General, we are 
also faced with the question of whether 
to legitimize yet again the partisan 
bulldozing of the Senate’s rules if those 
rules are even marginally inconven-
ient, even in committee session. Going 
down this path is not going to improve 
the Senate. 
I will be voting no, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, President 
Biden has decided to withdraw all 
forces from Afghanistan by September 
11, 2021. I believe this decision was one 
of the hardest President Biden will 
ever make. 
As Washington Post columnist David

him 
with

unpleasant

agreed, even though this would prob-
ably mean the fall of the Kabul govern-
ment and a return to civil war; stay for 
a limited period, perhaps negotiated 
with the Taliban, which would delay 
its eventual takeover; or stay for an 
undefined period, which could mean a 
long continuation of what is already 
the United States longest war.’’ 
In effect, there were no good choices. 
The President exercised his best judg-
ment to endorse a path that is most 
likely to protect the national security 
interests of the United States. 
I believe there were several factors 
over 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan 
that shaped the President’s decision. 
The most critical miscalculation over 
the past 20 years was the Bush admin-
istration’s decision to invade Iraq. 
We took our eye off the ball in Af-
ghanistan at a crucial time and instead 
pursued a war of choice in Iraq. The at-
tacks by al-Qaida on September 11 gal-
vanized the world. The authorization 
for use of military force passed the 
Senate 98 to nothing, while the French 
newspaper Le Monde proclaimed, ‘‘We 
are all Americans.’’ Most notably, for 
the first time, NATO invoked article 5 
of its charter, which calls upon its 
members to take action on behalf of 
any member nation which is attacked. 
The world was with us. 
But before we could really gain mo-
mentum in Afghanistan, the United 
States diverted to an unnecessary war 
of choice in Iraq. As journalist Steve 
Coll wrote in his definitive history of 
the war in Afghanistan, months after 
9/11, ‘‘On November 21, 2001, then Cen-
tral Commander Tommy Franks, who 
was planning our operations against 
Tora Bora, took a call from Donald 
Rumsfeld, who ordered him to start 
working on the plan for the invasion of 
Iraq. Rumsfeld told him to have some-
thing ready within a week.’’ 
As a consequence, General Franks’ 
attention was being forced elsewhere. 
As journalist Susan Glasser wrote in 
the Washington Post, in the Battle of 
Tora Bora, ‘‘corrupt warlords allowed 
bin Laden to escape, while special 
forces pleaded with the Pentagon to let 
them get in the fight.’’ As we now 
know, Osama bin Laden, the leader of 
al-Qaida and the mastermind of the 9/11 
attacks, was not captured for another 
decade. This decision wasted a period 
when the Taliban was routed and the 
Afghan population was welcoming. 
More recently, President Biden in-
herited a flawed agreement from the 
Trump administration. Known as the 
Doha agreement, it required the United 
States, its allies, and coalition part-
ners to withdraw all military forces by 
May 1, 2021. Nondiplomatic civilian 
personnel, private security contrac-
tors, trainers, and advisers were also 
required to leave. In effect, the entire 
international presence that has been 
the foundation for almost two decades 
of the Afghanistan effort was to dis-
appear on May 1. In exchange, the 
Taliban agreed not to attack the 
United States or its allies and prom-
ised not to allow ‘‘other individuals or 
groups, including al-Qaida, to use the 
soil of Afghanistan to threaten the se-
curity of the United States and its al-
lies.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1963 
April 15, 2021 
The only really verifiable condition 
on the Taliban of the Trump agreement 
was that the Taliban would not attack 
the United States or its allies. The re-
maining conditions were unenforceable 
and very, very difficult to certify. As 
General McKenzie, the commander of 
Central Command, testified to the 
Armed Services Committee just a few 
weeks after the agreement was con-
cluded: ‘‘We don’t need to trust them; 
we don’t need to like them; we don’t 
need to believe anything they say. We 
need to observe what they do.’’ 
What we have observed is alarming. 
While the Taliban may have adhered to 
one aspect of the deal by not attacking 
U.S. forces, they have violated the spir-
it of the agreement, as overall violence 
is on the rise. 
The Special Inspector General for Af-
ghan 
Reconstruction 
assessed 
that 
enemy attacks against Afghan security 
forces and civilians increased by 50 per-
cent in the third quarter of 2020. 
Former Acting Special Representative 
for Afghanistan and Pakistan Laurel 
Miller described ‘‘an uptick in targeted 
assassinations [which] has sent shock 
waves through urban areas.’’ In mid- 
March, Secretary of Defense Austin 
noted that, after meeting with Afghan 
President Ghani, ‘‘It’s obvious that the 
level of violence remains pretty high in 
the country.’’ 
Additionally, a United Nations report 
from last fall concluded that the rela-
tionship between al-Qaida and the 
Taliban had not been substantially 
changed by the February 2020 agree-
ment between the Taliban and the 
United States. The U.N. assessment 
noted, alarmingly, that ‘‘al-Qaida has 
been operating covertly in Afghanistan 
while still maintaining close relations 
with the Taliban’’ and that the group 
is, in their words, ‘‘quietly gaining 
strength in Afghanistan while con-
tinuing to operate with the Taliban 
under their protection.’’ 
Beyond the substance of the Trump 
agreement, the manner in which it was 
concluded was also deeply flawed. To 
begin with, the Trump administration 
concluded a deal with the Taliban, a 
fundamentalist group using the name 
‘‘Islamic 
Emirate 
of 
Afghanistan.’’ 
Even though the agreement states that 
the United States does not recognize 
such a state, its very formulation is a 
propaganda boon for the Taliban. 
As former Pakistani Ambassador to 
the United States Husain Haqqani 
noted: ‘‘Allowing the Taliban to refer 
to themselves as the Islamic Emirate, 
even in parentheses, allows them to 
build the narrative that they forced 
the U.S. to negotiate an exit from Af-
ghanistan just as the mujahideen had 
forced the Soviets out. If the adminis-
tration is eager to withdraw U.S. 
troops from Afghanistan, it would have 
done better to announce a no-deal exit 
than allowing the Taliban such a huge 
propaganda victory.’’ 
Additionally, the Trump agreement 
was completed exclusively between the 
Trump administration and the Taliban. 
There was no involvement of the Af-
ghan Government, reversing the long-
standing position of the United States, 
which prioritized an ‘‘Afghan-led, Af-
ghan-owned 
reconciliation 
process.’’ 
Further, there was no visible involve-
ment of our NATO allies who went into 
Afghanistan after we were attacked on 
September 11, 2001, when article 5 of 
the NATO charter was invoked for the 
first time. 
As the Afghan Study Group noted, 
the group led ably by General Dunford 
and our previous colleague Senator 
Ayotte: ‘‘Our NATO allies in particular 
have been steadfast in their support 
and have shared the sacrifice; over 1,000 
coalition troops have been killed since 
2001.’’ The Trump administration nego-
tiated their exit without their say, 
without their involvement. There was 
no involvement either by regional part-
ners despite potentially significant 
consequences for security in the re-
gion. As the Afghan Study Group fur-
ther noted: ‘‘An unstable Afghanistan 
risks destabilizing the region through 
continued trade in illicit drugs, the at-
traction of extremist ideologies and 
the possible exacerbation of the rivalry 
between India and Pakistan, two nu-
clear-armed powers.’’ 
Trump’s 
go-it-alone, 
rush-to-the- 
exits mentality led to a deal where the 
Taliban emerged as the key benefactor. 
The United States, its allies, and part-
ners won very little from the Trump 
deal. 
Now, we are approaching 20 years of 
warfare in Afghanistan, spanning over 
three different Presidential adminis-
trations or, perhaps more accurately, 1 
year of warfare repeated 20 times as we 
rotated troops in and out of Afghani-
stan. In addition to the disastrous 
pivot to Iraq and the flawed agreement 
with the Taliban, despite all our efforts 
over multiple administrations, we have 
been unable to build an effective fight-
ing force that could defeat the Taliban 
and hold territory. Afghan soldiers 
have fought bravely despite continuing 
pressure and massive casualties, and 
several components have emerged as 
particularly capable, such as the Af-
ghan special security forces, but after 
20 years, this is not sufficient progress. 
As the Afghan Study Group assessed: 
‘‘The ongoing lack of capacity and in-
efficiency of the [Afghan National De-
fense and Security Forces or] ANDSF 
limit its strategic options against the 
Taliban. As a result, the ANDSF is 
generally on the defensive to provide 
security for much of the population.’’ 
We were never able to change the 
‘‘checkpoint mentality’’ of the Afghan 
forces. Their focus on static positions, 
as much for appearance as for tactical 
advantage, still persists today, making 
them extremely vulnerable to a more 
agile Taliban. 
Moreover, two decades later, the Af-
ghan forces still have no organic 
logistical capabilities. An assessment 
by the Department of Defense from last 
June noted: ‘‘All components of the Af-
ghan National Defense and Security 
Forces will . . . continue to rely over 
the long term on contracted logistic 
support and on the United States for 
the vast majority of the funding needed 
to sustain combat operations.’’ As I re-
call the agreement that the Trump ad-
ministration negotiated, it requires the 
withdrawal of all contracted logistical 
support, and as Napoleon once com-
mented, ‘‘An army moves on its stom-
ach.’’ Without a logistical capability 
and without a tactically capable army, 
with few exceptions, the ability of the 
Government of Afghanistan and the 
military of Afghanistan to resist the 
Taliban is highly questionable. We 
should be looking seriously at our-
selves because, for 20 years of efforts 
and billions of dollars, I would have 
hoped that we would have seen a cred-
ible, decisive, effective Afghan force. 
Another crucial factor contributing 
immensely to the Taliban’s success has 
been the inability of the United States 
to eliminate the sanctuary the Taliban 
was granted in Pakistan. Center for 
Strategic and International Studies 
terrorism expert Seth Jones wrote in 
2018: ‘‘The Taliban[’s] . . . sanctuary in 
Pakistan and state support from orga-
nizations like [Inter-Services Intel-
ligence or] ISI have been essential to 
their war effort, and the U.S. failure to 
undermine this safe haven may be 
Washington’s most significant mistake 
[of the war].’’ As the Afghan Study 
Group notes, these ‘‘sanctuaries are es-
sential to the viability of the insur-
gency.’’ 
Additionally, Pakistan’s ISI aided 
and 
abetted 
the 
Taliban 
while 
opportunistically cooperating with the 
United States. As Brookings scholar 
Vanda Felbab-Brown assessed in 2018: 
‘‘Pakistan provided direct military and 
intelligence aid . . . resulting in the 
deaths of U.S. soldiers, Afghan security 
personnel, and civilians, plus signifi-
cant destabilization of Afghanistan.’’ 
This support to the Taliban runs 
counter to Pakistani cooperation with 
the United States, including, as they 
have, allowing the use of airspace and 
other infrastructure for which the 
United 
States 
provided 
significant 
funding. As the Afghan Study Group 
noted: ‘‘Pakistan has played both sides 
of the field.’’ 
These dynamics further play out 
against a complex environment in 
Pakistan, which has implications for 
the national security of the United 
States, its allies, and partners. Paki-
stan is simultaneously fragile and 
armed with nuclear weapons, making 
its 
vulnerability 
particularly 
dan-
gerous. To add to this toxic mix, Paki-
stan is in a longstanding struggle with 
its neighbor, India, which is also armed 
with nuclear weapons. As Seth Jones 
described: ‘‘Pakistan and India have 
long been involved in a balance-of- 
power struggle in South Asia. Both lay 
claim to the Kashmir region, and have 
fought three wars over Kashmir since 
1947. Afghanistan is not the ultimate 
objective of either country but rather 
an arena for competition in what has

long been called the ‘great game.’’’ 
While bogged down politically and 
militarily in daily crises in Afghani-
stan and Iraq, the United States, over 
multiple administrations, has been un-
able to focus the necessary attention 
on Pakistan. Therefore, these problems 
have only gotten worse. 
Another factor shaping the Presi-
dent’s decision is that the United 
States and its coalition partners were 
never able to develop an Afghan Gov-
ernment that could gain the confidence 
of the people, especially beyond the 
cities, and provide basic services, in-
cluding 
security, 
education, 
healthcare, and justice. A study by the 
World Bank in late 2019 found that 55 
percent of Afghans were living below 
the poverty line, with even basic civil-
ian services underfunded. The lack of 
the government’s ability to meet such 
needs erodes the people’s support for 
the government. 
Afghanistan has also been under-
mined by profound corruption. The Af-
ghan Study Group assessed that cor-
ruption has ‘‘delegitimized the existing 
government and created grievances 
that are exploited by the Taliban to 
gain support and, at times, legit-
imacy.’’ Corruption is a national secu-
rity concern that further erodes the 
ability of the government to build faith 
and trust. 
Additionally, the leadership of the 
Afghan Government is seen as being re-
moved from the populace. This makes 
it harder to understand the needs of 
the people and to govern effectively. A 
prime example of this conundrum is 
the current President, Ashraf Ghani. 
Ghani was reelected after a 5-month 
delay in the polling results and fol-
lowing a longstanding dispute with his 
political rival. While Ghani is a serious 
scholar and technocrat who literally 
wrote a book on fixing failed states, he 
appears unable to fix his own state. As 
the New York Times reported just last 
week, ‘‘From most advantage points, 
Mr. Ghani—well qualified for his job 
and deeply credentialed, with Johns 
Hopkins, 
Berkeley, 
Columbia, 
the 
World Bank, and the United Nations in 
his 
background—is 
thoroughly 
iso-
lated. A serious author with a first 
class intellect, he is dependent on the 
counsel of a handful, unwilling to even 
watch television news, those who know 
him say, and losing allies fast.’’ 
But even if President Ghani was a 
strong leader, it would likely not be 
enough. The instability of the central 
government, which has been fueled by 
rival factions seeking power resulting 
in inconclusive elections, has led to un-
wieldy power sharing arrangements. 
Beyond challenges between those polit-
ical officials and technocrats who want 
to serve the government and may have 
competing visions, there is the funda-
mental tension between those trying to 
achieve the complex task of governing 
Afghanistan in Kabul and the Taliban, 
who have a single focus: ejecting for-
eign forces. There also appears to be a 
lack of willingness by the government 
to seriously negotiate with the Taliban 
and make tough choices that could 
have obtained, perhaps, a lasting peace 
deal. 
The Afghan Government also re-
mains unable to generate revenue to 
fund its operations. Instead, it relies 
almost solely on foreign contributions. 
This includes an average of $5 billion in 
security assistance, along with $3.5 bil-
lion in civilian assistance from the 
United States and the international do-
nors each year. The World Bank as-
sessed in late 2019 that even if there 
was a peace agreement between the Af-
ghan Government and the Taliban, Af-
ghanistan would still need as much as 
$7 billion a year from foreign forces to 
sustain its most basic spending. 
With all of these complex dynamics 
at play, it underscores a further, albeit 
profoundly unsatisfactory conclusion 
facing the President. The alternative 
to withdrawal was not the status quo. 
More U.S. and NATO forces would have 
been required for self defense and espe-
cially if there was another attempt to 
‘‘surge’’ forces to degrade the Taliban. 
It appears that the President concluded 
that more troops might buy more time 
and casualties, but more time would 
not create a government that could de-
feat the Taliban and effectively govern 
Afghanistan. As the old Afghan saying 
goes: ‘‘You have all the watches; we 
have all the time.’’ 
It is important to emphasize, though, 
that the President’s decision should be 
seen as a transition, not closure. We 
still have vital security interests in the 
region. Afghanistan is not in the rear-
view mirror. Pakistan is not in the 
rearview mirror. There is a high prob-
ability that without NATO and U.S. 
support, the Afghan security forces 
will degrade and collapse, which will 
ultimately cause the Afghan Govern-
ment to collapse. The Trump adminis-
tration’s agreement with the Taliban 
included the departure of all security 
personnel, logisticians, and contrac-
tors, which means that when the 
United States leaves, the international 
presence that, again, is the foundation 
for Afghan resistance is removed. The 
intelligence 
community’s 
Annual 
Threat Assessment for 2021 noted: ‘‘The 
Afghan government will struggle to 
hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition 
withdraws support.’’ And according to 
the New York Times, American intel-
ligence agencies assessed that if U.S. 
troops leave before a peace deal is 
reached between the Afghan Govern-
ment and the Taliban, Afghanistan 
‘‘could fall largely under the control of 
the Taliban within two or three years 
after the withdrawal of international 
forces.’’ We have already seen evidence 
of this trend even prior to the full 
withdrawal. The International Crisis 
Group assessed that ‘‘as U.S. force lev-
els have fallen, battlefield dynamics 
have steadily shifted in the insurgents’ 
favor.’’ 
Dexter 
Filkins 
described: 
‘‘Since 2001, the main arena of conflict 
in Afghanistan has been the country-
side: the government held the cities, 
while the Taliban fought to control the 
villages and the towns, particularly in 
the south, their heartland. But by 
early this year, the paradigm had 
begun to fall apart. The Taliban were 
entrenched across the north; their 
shadow government had begun to creep 
into the cities.’’ 
Another possibility, either in the in-
terim or a permanent fact, is that the 
country could fracture with local war-
lords and the Taliban controlling dif-
ferent territory. This would further in-
tensify conflict, increase instability, 
and create second order effects, such as 
the flow of internationally displaced 
persons 
and 
refugees. 
The 
Inter-
national Crisis Group noted that the 
likelihood of fracture increases ‘‘if U.S. 
and other funding declines’’ and that it 
has the possibility of pulling Afghani-
stan’s neighbors and other regional 
powers into backing proxies in a 
multisided struggle. Again, the Afghan 
Study Group warned: ‘‘Any scenario in 
which the state collapses, as it did in 
1992, will make it considerably more 
difficult for the United States to en-
sure its fundamental national security 
interests.’’ 
If the Taliban reestablishes its emir-
ate in Afghanistan, it would likely re-
sult in erasing all the progress that has 
been made toward building democracy 
and particularly the rights of women 
and girls. As Seth Jones, again, wrote 
in a recent article published by the 
Combating Terrorism Center at West 
Point, ‘‘The Taliban is in many ways a 
different organization from the one 
that governed Afghanistan in the 1990s. 
Yet most of their leaders are neverthe-
less committed to an extreme interpre-
tation of Islam that is not shared by 
many Afghans, an autocratic political 
system that eschews democracy, and 
the persistence of relations with ter-
rorist groups like al-Qa‘ida.’’ 
If NATO and the United States de-
part, another consequence is increasing 
pressure to limit or end international 
aid. Afghanistan cannot fund itself 
and, even under the best case scenario, 
would require $7 billion from inter-
national donors annually. It will be ex-
tremely difficult to administer pro-
grams and provide aid on the ground 
without oversight, and that, too, would 
very well lead to smaller international 
donations. Furthermore, the entire 
budget of the Afghan Ministry of De-
fense is paid for by international con-
tributions. If soldiers are not getting 
paid, it would have a profound impact 
on national security. 
Another likely consequence of with-
drawal, which has been previously dis-
cussed, is the creation of a vacuum 
that allows the resurgence of terrorist 
groups, including al-Qaida and ISIS of 
the Khorasan Province. As the Afghan 
Study Group also pointed out, these 
groups are ‘‘for now limited by the 
military presence of the United States 
and its allies, which allows the threat 
to be monitored and, when necessary, 
disrupted, while also enabling Afghan 
Security Forces to continue to put

pressure on these groups.’’ However, 
the group warned: ‘‘During its delibera-
tions, the Study Group was advised 
that a complete U.S. withdrawal with-
out a peace agreement would allow 
these groups to gradually rebuild their 
capabilities in the Afghanistan Paki-
stan region such that they might be 
able to attack the U.S. homeland with-
in eighteen to thirty six months.’’ This 
timeline is short, alarming, and has di-
rect implications for our national secu-
rity. 
Also, an immediate concern as the 
United States begins to withdraw is an 
increase in attacks from Afghan forces 
against the United States and coalition 
forces, commonly referred to as ‘‘green 
on blue attacks.’’ Finally, we must an-
ticipate a flood of refugees as Afghans 
flee the chaos. In addition, we must do 
our part to aid those Afghans who have 
aided us. 
Given these facts and given the 
President’s difficult decision to leave 
Afghanistan, I believe we must take se-
rious actions to mitigate these threats. 
The withdrawal of U.S. forces should 
not mean an end to our counterterror-
ism efforts. Most importantly, we must 
ensure that Afghanistan will not be a 
source of planning, plotting, or projec-
tion of terrorist attacks around the 
globe, including against our homeland. 
Instead, we must transition to a new 
type of presence leaving the country 
but staying in the region in a meaning-
ful capacity. We must build an anti ter-
rorism infrastructure on the periphery 
of Afghanistan. We must continue to 
direct the proper level of attention, in-
telligence, and resources to evaluate 
the evolving terrorist threat in the re-
gion. This also includes closer coopera-
tion with our allies and partners. 
We must continue to engage regional 
powers diplomatically, and the Biden 
administration has already begun to 
reinvigorate that process. We must use 
the power of our alliances and particu-
larly those in the region who would en-
dure severe consequences and insta-
bility from sharing a border with a 
failed Afghanistan. Working in co-
operation, the United States and its al-
lies and regional partners must be a 
check on potential instability. 
President Biden is committed to en-
suring that this is not a forever war. 
But he has also made it clear he won’t 
allow Afghanistan to become a safe 
haven for terrorism. Our mission to 
protect the homeland remains. Our 
duty to do so remains. As we go for-
ward, this is a moment of transition, 
not of closure; this is a moment to do 
all we can to protect this country and 
hopefully ensure a safer region. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand 
today in opposition to this illegitimate 
motion to discharge the nomination of 
Vanita Gupta to become the Associate 
Attorney General of the United States. 
I say that this motion to discharge is 
illegitimate because it was—because 
the Senate Judiciary Committee and 
its chairman decided unilaterally to 
ram through a vote on Ms. Gupta in 
violation of the rules and precedents of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
As has been the longstanding tradi-
tion in the Judiciary Committee, mem-
bers were debating the nomination of 
Vanita Gupta and expected that every-
one would be given the opportunity to 
speak. 
But in the middle of a speech being 
delivered by one of the Judiciary Com-
mittee’s 
members, 
Senator 
COTTON 
from Arkansas, the chairman of the 
committee, Senator DURBIN, cut him 
off and unilaterally proceeded to a 
vote, effectively nuking the committee 
rules that should have allowed Senator 
COTTON and others to speak. 
Never, in the more than 10 years that 
I have served on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, have I seen a chairman of that 
committee so blatantly, brazenly vio-
late rule and principle and precedent in 
this way. This behavior is not only un-
usual, but it is inexcusable. 
Lengthy debate in committee mark-
ups is actually much more common 
than some in this Chamber might have 
you believe. For example, Democrats 
filibustered the nomination of former 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions for so 
long that then-Chairman CHUCK GRASS-
LEY was forced to delay a consideration 
of his nomination until the next mark-
up. 
You have got that right. Chairman 
GRASSLEY actually followed the com-
mittee rules and allowed for all of our 
colleagues to speak, notwithstanding 
the fact that they disagreed with him, 
notwithstanding the fact that it was 
contentious, notwithstanding the fact 
that he didn’t like what they were say-
ing. 
And by doing so, he was forced—be-
cause he was complying with the rules 
and the precedents of the Senate—to 
delay the consideration of Attorney 
General Sessions’ nomination. But that 
is what he did. He did that instead be-
cause it was preferable to an act of uni-
laterally forcing a vote and thereby 
nuking 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee’s 
rules. 
Now, to put this in context, we need 
to understand that Judiciary Com-
mittee rule IV states: 
The Chair shall enter a non-debatable mo-
tion to bring a matter before the Committee 
to a vote. If there is objection to bringing a 
matter to a vote without further debate, a 
roll call vote of the Committee shall be 
taken, and debate shall be terminated if the 
motion to bring the matter to a vote without 
further debate passes with twelve votes in 
the affirmative, one of which must be cast by 
the minority. 
Rule IV essentially preserves the 
right of minority members to speak. 
Chairman DURBIN
decided to nuke 
that part of rule IV in particular be-
cause he knew that he didn’t have 12 
votes to prematurely end debate. 
Now, when you are in the majority, it 
can be tempting to run right past cer-
tain rules, knocking things over in the 
process in order to get your party’s 
nominees confirmed. But I think it is 
important for us to resist that tempta-
tion in order to protect the rules of our 
institution from partisan passions. 
Following these rules, respecting mi-
nority prerogatives, is precisely what 
allows us to maintain bipartisan co-
operation in the Senate and lower the 
partisan tensions in our country. This 
is all the more important when we con-
sider that there is no true majority in 
the Senate, and there is no majority at 
all on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Unfortunately, with this breach, it 
looks like some of my colleagues might 
prefer convenience over debate. I find 
that most unfortunate, especially be-
cause I have worked with so many of 
them on a bipartisan basis on so many 
issues. 
Now, some of my colleagues may 
claim that Republicans have done this 
very thing many times. That, however, 
is not the case. On multiple occasions, 
we allowed for extended debate and 
even delayed reporting of matters be-
fore the committee, like Attorney Gen-
eral Sessions’ nomination and the 
Crossfire Hurricane subpoenas, until 
the next markup. When we set votes 
with the consent of the majority, the 
chairman followed committee prece-
dent and did so through a rollcall 
vote—again, 
consistent 
with 
com-
mittee precedent. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Now, you might ask why Republicans 
felt so strongly about speaking on Ms. 
Gupta’s nomination before the vote 
was cast in the committee markup. 
Well, it might have something to do 
with the fact that Ms. Gupta’s answers 
to questions were troubling to many 
members on the committee, including 
answers to questions regarding a wide 
range of topics, including the legaliza-
tion of narcotics, eliminating qualified 
immunity, defunding police, the death 
penalty, among many others, and the 
fact that it appears that many of those 
answers were inconsistent with her 
past statements, and in other cases, 
difficult to defend. 
When before the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Ms. Gupta provided answers to 
questions regarding some of these 
evolving positions. Many of those an-
swers were less than compelling—in-
deed, she seemed to be intending to dis-
tance herself from fairly radical posi-
tions that she had, in fact, taken in the 
past. 
Before the same committee, the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, the very 
same Judiciary Committee that re-
cently had this markup vote that 
ended in a violation of the Senate 
rules—before that very same com-
mittee last year, on June 16, 2020, Ms. 
Gupta testified under oath that leaders 
must ‘‘heed calls . . . to decrease police 
budgets and the scope, role, and re-
sponsibility of police in our lives.’’ 
When asked about her advocacy for 
defunding the police, Ms. Gupta said 
that she ‘‘disagreed’’ with that charac-
terization.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1966 
April 15, 2021 
Even the Washington Post, not ex-
actly a conservative media outlet, 
caught Ms. Gupta’s flip-flop, correctly 
characterizing her June 16, 2020, testi-
mony as ‘‘exactly what ‘defunding the 
police’ is all about. Now Gupta says she 
has never supported the idea.’’ 
Now, does President Biden really 
think it is a good idea to put radical 
ideologues who have publicly espoused 
support for defunding the police in 
charge of the Department of Justice? 
Well, perhaps he does, as evidenced 
by his nominations of Vanita Gupta 
and Kristen Clarke for top roles. 
I am concerned about Ms. Gupta’s ap-
parent disregard for Americans who 
hold views dissimilar from her own. In 
2018, she tweeted that Senator SUSAN 
COLLINS
had failed her constituents 
based on her support for Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh and was ‘‘sending a dan-
gerous message’’ to survivors of sexual 
assault. 
While Ms. Gupta repeatedly asked 
Senators for forgiveness for her many 
inappropriate tweets and asked for a 
second chance, it is significant here 
that she didn’t give that second chance 
to others when the shoe was on the 
other foot. 
For example, when Ryan Bounds was 
nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit, Ms. Gupta said 
the following about some comments he 
had made when he was in college: 
While he has recently apologized for those 
comments, the timing of that apology sug-
gests it is one of convenience rather than re-
morse, offered in a last-ditch effort to sal-
vage his nomination and win the support of 
his home-state senators. 
It appears here that Ms. Gupta per-
haps wants to provide no grace, no sec-
ond chance to others for things they 
wrote in college but then has asked for 
Senators to give her grace and a second 
chance for insensitive statements from 
only a few years ago or, in some cases, 
only a few months ago. 
If past practices are any indication, I 
am concerned that she might begin to 
wield the Department of Justice as a 
weapon of sorts against anyone and 
anything holding different views from 
her own and that she may do so aggres-
sively by conducting as many expen-
sive, hostile pattern-and-practice in-
vestigations against State and local 
law enforcement as she can, whether 
they are warranted or not, if, in her 
view, they somehow deserve it or they 
somehow disagree with her. Based on 
her past use of pattern-and-practice in-
vestigations while she was running the 
Department of Justice’s Civil Rights 
Division, I worry that she might sub-
ject State and local law enforcement 
jurisdictions to lengthy and expensive 
review requirements, forcing them to 
buckle under her policy preferences 
and sending warning messages to other 
jurisdictions. 
I am concerned that she might inap-
propriately rely on the outside activist 
groups for which she has lobbied to for-
mulate policy and practices for the De-
partment of Justice and State and 
local law enforcement agencies. I am 
concerned, too, that she will use third- 
party settlement agreements to reward 
the activist groups for which she has 
lobbied at the expense of others. 
Now, advocates of Ms. Gupta claim 
frequently that she is a consensus 
builder. I don’t doubt that. In fact, I 
would note here that Ms. Gupta and I 
have worked on the same side of issues 
that I care deeply about, and I note 
here that I find her to be a delightful 
person and a remarkably gifted mind 
and lawyer. She is very talented, and 
she is someone who seems to be a genu-
inely nice person in many, many ways. 
But if we are going to talk about con-
sensus building, I think a fair test to 
evaluate whether someone is a con-
sensus builder might involve looking at 
how they treat those with whom they 
disagree. Unfortunately, Ms. Gupta’s 
public statements don’t necessarily re-
sult in flying colors on that test. 
Again, the issue here is not whether 
she agrees with those who disagree 
with her. We have already established 
that she disagrees with those who hold 
different views than her own. The ques-
tion is, How does she treat them? 
Here is what Ms. Gupta said about 
Judge Sarah Pitlyk: 
Sarah Pitlyk is unqualified and unfit for a 
lifetime position on our federal courts. . . . 
She has defended the most extreme, anti- 
abortion laws our Nation has seen to date. 
This is what she said about Judge 
Lee Rudofsky: 
Rudofsky . . . has challenged the constitu-
tionality of reproductive rights under the 
Fourteenth Amendment and has effectively 
asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. 
Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. . . . 
Rudofsky is unfit and would bring a clear 
bias to the bench. 
In a 2017 blog post, Ms. Gupta advo-
cated for forcing Colorado baker, Jack 
Phillips, to create a custom-designed 
cake celebrating a same-sex wedding 
even though it would violate his reli-
gious beliefs. She said: 
Religious liberty is not a talisman that 
confers absolute immunity from any per-
sonal constraints at all: At times, the free 
exercise 
of 
religion 
yields 
to 
other 
foundational values, including freedom from 
harm and [freedom from] discrimination. 
Now, fortunately, in this instance, 
Supreme Court Justices—seven of the 
nine Supreme Court Justices, in fact— 
disagreed with her position in the Mas-
terpiece Cakeshop case. 
Now, she has reiterated this senti-
ment time and time again. In 2017, she 
tweeted: ‘‘Yes, freedom of religion is a 
fundamental right, but it is not an ab-
solute right.’’ 
After the Supreme Court ruled in 
favor of the conscience rights of the 
Little Sisters’ of the Poor, she called 
the decision ‘‘troubling’’ and ‘‘discrimi-
nation sanctioned by the Court,’’ writ-
ing that ‘‘this type of discrimination 
will potentially inflict harm on hun-
dreds of thousands of people and dis-
proportionately impact women of color 
and people in lower-income groups.’’ 
Now, let me be very clear on this 
issue. Let me be very clear about what 
she was talking about. Ms. Gupta in 
that statement was indicating that she 
thought the government should force a 
convent of nuns who have taken vows 
of celibacy to provide birth control 
against their religious convictions. 
That is troubling, and that is not 
consistent with our understanding of 
the free exercise of religion. Look, no 
one would argue that any one constitu-
tional right is absolute, in that no 
other consideration can ever come into 
play. No one would argue that a gen-
erally applicable religiously neutral 
law can have no application ever where 
it conflicts in some way with an asser-
tion of religious freedom. We are not 
talking here about whether it is abso-
lute or not. But her own application of 
that would be deeply troubling I think 
to most Americans. 
What also concerns me is whether, 
with the force of the U.S. Department 
of Justice behind her, whether she is 
capable of respecting the constraints of 
the law, of the Constitution, and of fed-
eralism. 
In her efforts to push her policy pref-
erences and reward those with whom 
she disagrees, I am very concerned that 
she might stretch the boundaries of her 
authority much further than it was 
ever intended to go. 
Ms. Gupta has exhibited on Twitter 
and elsewhere that she is someone who 
holds very strident political views, 
views that many would regard as very 
radical, and I feel neither confident nor 
comfortable that she will respect those 
with views contrary to her own. 
On that basis, I urge my fellow Sen-
ators to vote against Ms. Gupta and 
this illegitimate motion to discharge. I 
urge President Biden to send us nomi-
nees who will achieve his stated goal of 
unifying our country and not dividing 
it. 
I yield the floor.

MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my 
friend and colleague from Utah is not 
the first to come to the floor on the 
Republican side and raise questions 
about committee procedure that led to 
Vanita Gupta being considered today 
before the U.S. Senate. 
They say it is unheard of, unthink-
able, unimaginable, unfathomable that 
the Senate committee rules were not 
carefully followed and that their at-
tempt at a filibuster was in some way 
diverted. 
I would ask unanimous consent to 
have printed into the RECORD a memo 
entitled ‘‘Senate Judiciary Committee 
Rule Violations by [Senate Judiciary 
Committee] Chairs Graham, Grassley, 
and Hatch.’’ 
There being no objection, the material was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as fol-

S1967 
April 15, 2021 
a. Violation: Rule III 
i. Date: July 25, 2019 
ii. Summary: Chairman Graham’s Secure 
and Protect Act was on the agenda. Then- 
Ranking Member Feinstein was the only 
Democrat in attendance. Graham stated that 
he would deem the bill held over at the fol-
lowing week’s markup. This constituted 
‘‘conducting business’’ under the Commit-
tee’s rules, despite the lack of a quorum.

i. Date: August 1, 2019 
ii. Summary: At an August 1, 2019, markup, 
Chairman Graham forced a vote on his Se-
cure and Protect Act despite a request to 
hold over the bill. Graham ignored Demo-
cratic requests to hold the bill over; called a 
vote—setting a time certain for final passage 
of the bill—without first allowing any Demo-
cratic members to speak; and did not allow 
any amendments to be offered.

i. Date: October 15, 2020 
ii. Summary: Chairman Graham held a 
markup during which Committee Repub-
licans held over Amy Coney Barrett’s nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court. Chairman Gra-
ham also called a vote to vote on Barrett’s 
nomination at a time certain the following 
week. However, Barrett’s hearing had not 
yet concluded by this point—the witness 
panels were held in the afternoon on October 
15, 2020, after the markup vote. Committee 
Democrats objected to holding this markup 
before the hearing concluded, and Senator 
Durbin—the only Democrat in attendance— 
moved to adjourn the markup. Graham 
overrode Durbin’s motion on a roll call vote 
in violation of the Committee’s quorum rule.

including at least two Members of the minor-
ity, must be present to transact business. No 
Committee Democrats attended this mark-
up, at which Amy Coney Barrett’s nomina-

CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY RULE VIOLATIONS 
1. Grassley (115th Cong.) 
a. Violation: Rule IV 
i. Date: September 13, 2018 
ii. Summary: Then-Chairman Grassley vio-
lated Rule IV by passing a motion to cut off 
debate on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination 
without an affirmative vote from one mem-
ber of the minority. At this markup, the Ju-
diciary 
Committee 
held 
over 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s nomination. Numerous other 
items were on the agenda that day, most no-
tably a motion from thenChairman Grassley 
to set a precise time at which the committee 
would vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination the 
following week. Senators Leahy and Durbin 
argued that Grassley’s motion violated Rule 
IV by cutting off debate without the consent 
of any member of the minority. Senator Dur-
bin read Rule IV aloud and then summarized: 
‘‘The point is, you need 11 votes and one 
member of the minority to stop debate on 
any matter, let alone a nomination to the 
Supreme Court.’’ Grassley responded, ‘‘The 
answer to your question is no we don’t, and 
we’ve checked with the Senate Parliamen-
tarian.’’ Grassley asserted that Chairman 
Hatch had done the same thing in 2003, set-
ting a precedent that he was following. 
Other items on the agenda that day in-
cluded: six motions to subpoena various doc-
uments related to Kavanaugh’ s record; 21 
lower court judicial nominees; a nominee to 
be a U.S. Attorney; a nominee to be a U.S. 
Marshal; a nominee to be Director of Na-
tional Drug Control Policy; and five legisla-
tive bills.

1. Hatch (108th Cong.) 
a. Violation: Rule IV 
i. Date: February 27, 2003 
ii. Summary: At a markup, Chairman 
Hatch ignored Rule IV by cutting short Com-
mittee debate on the nominations of John 
Roberts (D.C. Cir.) and Deborah Cook (6th 
Cir.). Pursuant to Rule IV, then-Ranking 
Member Leahy asked for a vote before Hatch 
ended debate, but Hatch refused, directing 
the clerk to call the roll and noting that 
‘‘[t]he Chairman’s prerogative is to deter-
mine that we can go ahead to a vote’’ and 
that Rule IV ‘‘does not apply to executive 
nominations.’’

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator DURBIN for his leader-
ship, and following my colleague and 
friend, Senator LEE, I disagree with 
him vehemently about Vanita Gupta. 
She is someone I have worked closely 
with for years on voting rights, on po-
lice reform, and just last year I 
marched with her across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge with the late John Lewis 
to mark the 55th anniversary of Bloody 
Sunday in Selma, AL. 
After working alongside her to build 
a more just system, I have no doubt 
that she will take this job on with two 
words, two words that I think are so 
important right now to build trust 
with the people of this country: honor 
and integrity. That is what has marked 
her career. 
As a civil rights lawyer, public serv-
ant, and as President of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, 
the Nation’s oldest, largest, and most 
diverse civil and human rights coali-
tion, she has a record of fighting for all 
Americans, with dedication, consist-
ency, and—and—a willingness to work 
across ideological lines to achieve re-
sults. 
Why did she get those police endorse-
ments and the kind of support that she 
got, even though she was taking on re-
form? It is because she earned people’s 
respect. She is the right person for the 
right time in the Justice Department, 
and I say this coming from Minnesota, 
where my State is reeling after the 
killing of Duante Wright. 
Our hearts break for Daunte’s family 
and for our community, which is still 
in the midst of the George Floyd mur-
der trial of Derek Chauvin. I was so 
proud and am so proud of the ordinary 
citizens that came forward and testi-
fied from my State: a clerk in the 
store, a man walking by, all of them 
having carried the burden—the bur-
den—of this murder, looking inside 
themselves thinking: What could I 
have done better? 
And that case will soon conclude, but 
those citizens coming forward and ac-
tually the law enforcement coming for-
ward and testifying at all levels of law 
enforcement for the prosecution of 
Derek Chauvin—that meant something 
to the people of my State. I want to be 
able to go back and tell those citizens 
who testified that you don’t carry this 
burden alone; that we have a Justice 
Department that is going to stand up 
for you. 
And, for me, one of those key people 
is Vanita Gupta. She is exactly who we 
need right now to champion the cause 
of equal justice under the law. 
She has described the Department as 
an institution she loves dearly because, 
as she said, it bears the name of a 
value—justice—one 
that 
carries 
a 
unique charge and North Star. It is the 
sacred keeper of the promise of equal 
justice under the law, and coming from 
the North Star State, that means a lot. 
Her commitment to defending the 
Constitution and upholding the integ-
rity of this important Agency is, for 
her, a professional calling. It is also a 
personal calling. As she has described, 
she inherited from her parents, who 
came to this country, a belief in the 
promise of America, one that carries 
with it a personal responsibility to 
make this country better for everyone. 
We all know immigrants who think 
like that every day—people who have 
just arrived and people who have raised 
their families here. They are Vanita 
Gupta. There is no question that Ms. 
Gupta has the experience for this job. 
As an attorney for the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, she 
worked on the frontlines, fighting in 
court to protect the civil rights of 
some of the most vulnerable people. 
Later, at the American Civil Liberties 
Union, she brought cases on behalf of 
immigrant children and worked to end 
mass incarceration while keeping com-
munities safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1968 
April 15, 2021 
While serving as our country’s chief 
civil rights prosecutor at the Depart-
ment of Justice, during the Obama ad-
ministration, she led critical work on 
criminal justice reform, prosecuting 
hate crimes and human trafficking, de-
fending the right to vote, and pro-
tecting the rights of the LGBTQ com-
munity and those with disabilities. 
Ms. Gupta’s depth of experience at 
the Department of Justice and her 
years as a civil rights attorney make 
her imminently qualified to serve as 
Associate Attorney General. In that 
position, she will oversee the work of 
the Department’s Civil Rights Division 
and will help direct the Department’s 
work to reform our justice system. 
Having helped to lead the Federal re-
view of police practices, she under-
stands the need for systemic reform in 
our justice system, as well as ways to 
work with law enforcement—with law 
enforcement—to 
make 
necessary 
changes. 
That is why she has the support of 
police chiefs, sheriffs, and major law 
enforcement groups across the country, 
including the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, including the International As-
sociation of Chiefs of Police, and in-
cluding the Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation. They know that Ms. Gupta is a 
trusted partner who, as the Fraternal 
Order of Police wrote in a letter of sup-
port, has ‘‘always worked with us to 
find common ground even when that 
seemed impossible.’’ 
Grover Norquist, a Republican and 
president of Americans for Tax Reform, 
described Ms. Gupta as ‘‘an honest 
broker; someone with an ability not 
only to understand but also appreciate 
different perspectives. She was some-
one who sought consensus,’’ he said. 
That is exactly the kind of person we 
need at the Department right now. 
I look forward to working with her 
on the next steps in our efforts to re-
form our criminal justice system, 
which we were able to discuss at her 
hearing. We talked about her commit-
ment to police reform and the need to 
increase funding for alternatives to in-
carceration, such as drug court, which 
is something I have worked on for 
years since my time as county attor-
ney, and her support for conviction in-
tegrity units to help States to review 
legal cases for people believed to be in-
nocent. She gets that the work of a 
prosecutor is, yes, working for safety, 
but it is also to be a minister of justice 
and to make sure that people are treat-
ed equally under the law. 
I also have talked to Ms. Gupta about 
the urgent need to finally reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act, 
which I hope my colleagues and I will 
work to pass and get to President 
Biden’s desk. In the Obama administra-
tion, she coordinated the Department 
of Justice’s efforts to develop guidance 
supported by data on how law enforce-
ment can prevent gender bias when re-
sponding to sexual assault and domes-
tic violence. At our hearing, she af-
firmed the important role that the De-
partment has in protecting victims of 
domestic violence, and I look forward 
to working with her on these issues. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Antitrust, 
Competition 
Policy 
and 
Consumer Rights, I am also pleased 
that Ms. Gupta committed to make 
vigorous antitrust enforcement a pri-
ority. I think there is agreement from 
both sides of the aisle that robust com-
petition is essential to protect con-
sumers, workers, and businesses, large 
and small. 
I am confident that Ms. Gupta will 
lead the Department’s efforts to con-
front monopoly power and restore com-
petitive 
markets 
along 
with 
Lisa 
Monaco and along with, of course, the 
Attorney 
General 
himself, 
Merrick 
Garland. 
Ms. Gupta’s history as a champion of 
civil rights and record as a consensus 
builder makes her, as I said, the right 
person at the right time. She has the 
backing of more than 220 national civil 
and human rights organizations, in-
cluding the ACLU, the NAACP, and the 
Human Rights Campaign. 
She has, as I said, the support from 
law enforcement and from former De-
partment of Justice leaders from both 
parties. She is a person who works to 
bring people together to get big things 
done. That is what we need right now, 
someone who sees that vision but also 
understands that the way we get to jus-
tice is by doing things step by step by 
step and bringing people with you as 
you march along. We need to do more 
than restore what has been undermined 
or lost. We need the courage of leader-
ship to preserve and strengthen our de-
mocracy by protecting the rule of law. 
I would like to finally acknowledge 
that her nomination is historic. In ad-
dition to Ms. Gupta’s years of experi-
ence, dedication to justice, and support 
from across the ideological spectrum, 
she will be the first civil rights lawyer 
and the first woman of color to serve as 
Associate Attorney General. I look for-
ward to confirming her to be Associate 
Attorney General, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of Vanita Gupta’s 
nomination to be the Associate Attor-
ney General of the U.S. Department of 
Justice. Those of us who have had the 
joy and the honor of getting to know 
her and working with her know Ms. 
Gupta to be engaging and smart, a 
skilled and balanced lawyer and practi-
tioner, and someone who will bring 
great values in leadership to the U.S. 
Department of Justice. 
Ms. Gupta has devoted her career to 
public service and to protecting and ad-
vancing the civil and constitutional 
rights we all cherish as Americans.

Biden,

General 
Garland, and Lisa Monaco, the Presi-
dent’s nominee to be Deputy Attorney 
General, have all made clear Ms. Gupta 
would serve as an integral part of the 
leadership team at the Justice Depart-
ment. She would bring to that critical 
role a long record of working with 
folks across the ideological spectrum 
in our country on some of our Nation’s 
most 
difficult 
and 
most 
sensitive 
issues, some that are urgent and press-
ing like criminal justice reform and po-
licing. 
Unfortunately, a campaign launched 
against Ms. Gupta shortly after her 
nomination has painted a misleading 
portrait of her as a partisan and a rad-
ical. I won’t repeat or rehash these un-
founded critiques, but the fact is this 
caricature could not be further from 
the truth. 
As letter after letter has come in 
from her supporters to the Judiciary 
Committee, in which I serve, we heard 
over and over that, at her core, Ms. 
Gupta is a person who seeks to build 
bridges, to understand others’ points of 
view, and to build consensus and solve 
problems. 
One of the elements of this campaign 
to mischaracterize her suggests that 
somehow she is anti-police or anti-law 
enforcement, and, in this particular in-
stance, the distinction between those 
who worked with her and know her and 
what we have heard in this social 
media campaign and in our committee 
and here on the floor of the Senate 
could not be sharper. 
We heard from multiple leading na-
tional law enforcement organizations 
that have worked with her in specific 
and clear and concrete terms. The Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association, in their 
letter of support, said: 
Ms. Gupta has an open mind and a strong 
desire to understand the viewpoint of each 
stakeholder. She is able to find common 
ground with law enforcement. 
They added: 
[Ms. Gupta] possesses immense credibility 
among law enforcement leaders. 
And they said: 
[She is] exactly the type of leader who is 
needed in the Justice Department today. 
From the Fraternal Order of Police: 
She always worked with us to find common 
ground, even when that seemed impossible. 
Her open and candid approach has created a 
working relationship grounded in mutual re-
spect and understanding. 
And the Federal Law Enforcement 
Officers Association in their letter 
said: 
[Ms. Gupta has a] proven history of work-
ing with law enforcement agencies . . . and 
elected officials across the spectrum. 
We even heard from a leading con-
servative advocate and activist, Grover 
Norquist, the leader of Americans for 
Tax Reform. Mr. Norquist wrote: 
I have come to know and respect Ms. 
Gupta through our common work on crimi-
nal justice reform issues. I found her strong-
ly qualified, effective, principled, driven by a 
desire to seek common purpose and con-
sensus. . . . At every step, Ms. Gupta was an 
honest broker, someone with an ability to 
understand, appreciate different perspec-
tives, someone who sought consensus. 
Last but not least, we heard from 
Mark Holden, general counsel of Koch

Industries, who worked with her on 
criminal justice reform and wrote the 
committee saying: 
I respected and admired how Ms. Gupta 
was not ideologically driven, but principled 
and solutions-oriented. . . . Ms. Gupta is a 
principled leader who seeks to find common 
ground and will work with anyone com-
mitted to making the system better and 
more effective. 
I just plead with my colleagues to re-
flect for a moment: Are these the sorts 
of letters that we would have received 
in support of someone who is genuinely 
intolerant and in support of someone 
who is the radical activist this mis-
leading campaign has attempted to 
portray her as being? 
Instead, 
Vanita 
Gupta 
has 
dem-
onstrated in her work and in her career 
that she is pragmatic, she is principled, 
and she is a relationship builder in 
search of solutions. Given this broad 
and bipartisan support in the letters 
that came to us on the committee and 
as Members of this body, I was sur-
prised and disappointed that some of 
my colleagues on the other side have 
continued to levee this misleading bar-
rage of unsubstantiated attacks. 
So, in conclusion, I would ask my 
colleagues to consider her fairly and to 
listen to the range and the scores of 
groups that have described her as a 
principled, honest broker. She cares 
deeply about protecting the civil rights 
and civil liberties of all Americans and 
about being fairminded and taking into 
consideration all points of view. She 
will bring that same approach to her 
service and leadership as Associate At-
torney General. 
This should not be a party-line, par-
tisan vote. Vanita Gupta is the right 
leader at the right time to help our 
U.S. Department of Justice tackle 
some very difficult issues, and I am 
pleased to stand in support of her nom-
ination and will vote for her confirma-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, later 
this afternoon, the Senate will vote on 
whether to discharge the nomination of 
Vanita Gupta, the nominee for Asso-
ciate Attorney General, from the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
Ms. Gupta is a polarizing figure, as 
reflected by the vote in the Judiciary 
Committee. It was a tie vote, 11 votes 
to 11. So she failed to receive a major-
ity support from the committee, and 
now the Senate must vote on whether 
or not her nomination can come to the 
Senate floor for consideration. 
I want to be clear, though, the pas-
sionate opposition of this nominee is 
not about politics. I voted to confirm 
the vast majority of President Biden’s 
nominees, my attitude being that he 
won the election and he is entitled to 
populate a Cabinet and other impor-
tant positions with people he has con-
fidence in. But there are limits. 
The President’s nominees for the top 
two positions for the Department of 
Justice did not require this extraor-
dinary step. I voted to support Ms. 
Monaco’s nomination, who has been 
nominated for Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral, as well as the Attorney General 
himself, Judge Merrick Garland. As I 
said, those were not controversial 
nominees. This nominee is a polarizing, 
partisan activist and should not be 
confirmed to this important position. 
The lack of support for Ms. Gupta is 
not a reflection on her political affili-
ation, nor of her gender, nor of her 
race, as the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee intimated. The opposition 
to Ms. Gupta is a direct result of her 
history of inflammatory public state-
ments, radical policy positions, and a 
laundry list of misleading statements 
and flat-out lies during her sworn testi-
mony before the Judiciary Committee. 
The position of Associate Attorney 
General 
is 
not 
some 
bureaucratic 
paper-pusher. This is the third ranking 
position at the Department of Justice, 
the highest law enforcement Agency in 
America. The American people deserve 
to know that the individuals leading 
the Department have no agenda other 
than to fairly and impartially admin-
ister justice, but based on everything 
we now know about Ms. Gupta, I do not 
have faith in her ability to deliver on 
this most basic principle. 
Ms. Gupta is not a career public serv-
ant. She is a partisan culture warrior 
with a radical agenda. During her ten-
ure in jobs outside of government, dur-
ing which she was a registered lob-
byist, Ms. Gupta was quite outspoken 
about her views on just about every 
topic you can imagine. She slandered 
Supreme Court nominees. She vilified 
organizations that she disagreed with. 
She even took a crack or two at a num-
ber of our Senate colleagues. 
But the words I find most troubling 
are those that relate directly to the 
policies of the Department of Justice 
itself. As the Judiciary Committee 
evaluated Ms. Gupta’s qualifications, 
she was asked about her previous 
writings and her public statements on 
a variety of topics. There is a lot to 
sort through. 
First, following the tragic killing of 
George Floyd last summer, people 
across the country engaged in an im-
portant discussion and debate about 
the use of force by police officers and 
responsible policing strategies. 
The Judiciary Committee held a 
hearing on this very topic, and Ms. 
Gupta was one of the star witnesses. At 
the time, she was the president and 
CEO of the Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights. She testified 
before the committee there, under 
oath, that it is ‘‘critical for state and 
local leaders to heed calls . . . to de-
crease police budgets and the scope, 
[and] role, and responsibility of police 
in our lives.’’ 
Well, for obvious reasons, the phrase 
‘‘decrease police budgets’’ and ‘‘defund 
the police’’ lead to the same conclusion 
that she believes police departments 
need less—not more—resources in order 
to maintain public safety. 
When Ms. Gupta was asked about this 
at her confirmation hearing, she did 
not mince words. She said she does not 
support defunding the police. So I fol-
lowed up with a written question for 
the record. I asked Ms. Gupta, fol-
lowing the hearing, to explain the dis-
tinction 
between 
‘‘decrease 
police 
budgets’’ and ‘‘defund the police,’’ so 
we could understand her views. After 
all, the Associate Attorney General 
will play an important role in making 
grants to fund States and local police 
departments. But Ms. Gupta offered no 
explanation. She simply said, once 
again, she does not support defunding 
the police. 
Now, I can understand when people 
change their minds. I think reasonably 
intelligent people, as they acquire new 
information, maybe reflecting on their 
previous points of view, change their 
minds, but Ms. Gupta did not offer a 
single bit of information for this shift 
between her statement last summer 
saying that State and local leaders 
must heed calls to ‘‘decrease police 
budgets’’ and her current position, 
which is that she does not support 
defunding the police. 
Then there were her statements on 
qualified immunity. This is an impor-
tant issue for Congress to discuss and 
debate because it is qualified immunity 
that protects law enforcement officers, 
given the nature of the discretionary 
decisions they need to make in emer-
gency circumstances. Again, there are 
people on both sides of that argument. 
But in June 2020, less than a year 
ago, Ms. Gupta argued in a Washington 
Post opinion piece that it is time to re-
visit qualified immunity. Well, you can 
imagine I asked her about that at the 
hearing. And, again, she said, un-
equivocally, 
she 
does 
not 
support 
eliminating qualified immunity. But, 
once again, we received no explanation 
for her changed position. 
And while her statements are inten-
tionally, I believe, unclear at best, her 
words about previously held beliefs on 
drug policy represent an irreconcilable 
conflict. Back in 2012, Ms. Gupta au-
thored an opinion piece on November 4, 
2012, in the HuffPost. In that article, 
she argued that the States should de-
criminalize possession of all drugs—all 
drugs, not just marijuana, all drugs, 
presumably, to include prescription 
opioids, 
heroin, 
methamphetamine, 
fentanyl, you name it—all drugs. 
Well, I don’t have to remind Members 
of this Senate that more than 80,000 
Americans 
have 
died 
from 
drug 
overdoses this last year alone, and 
much of it would include the sorts of 
drugs that, back in 2012, Ms. Gupta said 
should be legalized—or at least de-
criminalized, to be fair—decriminal-
ized, although the distinction between 
that may be lost on some. 
Well, I am sure that this will surprise 
no one that this is a controversial 
view. Congress has spent billions upon 
billions of dollars to fight the opioid 
epidemic in this country. We passed 
the Cures Act, the CARES Act, to try

to get at this epidemic of opioid addic-
tion and abuse. But Ms. Gupta, circa 
2012, said that these drugs—all drugs— 
should be decriminalized for personal 
use. 
Well, I followed up with a question 
because, during the hearing, Ms. Gupta 
talked 
about 
how 
her 
views 
had 
evolved since 2012. Again, as we all 
have different experiences over time, 
we learn new information, perhaps re-
flect on our previously held views, I un-
derstand 
how 
people’s 
views 
can 
change. But then she wasn’t satisfied 
with that answer. 
So I followed up with a written ques-
tion. I asked Ms. Gupta if she ever 
made this statement that is printed in 
black and white in the HuffPost, dated 
circa 2012. She said: ‘‘I have never’’— 
never—‘‘advocated 
for 
the 
decrimi-
nalization of all drugs.’’ She said: 
‘‘States should decriminalize simple 
possession of all drugs.’’ Compare that 
with ‘‘I have never advocated for the 
decriminalization of all drugs.’’ Those 
are irreconcilable positions. 
And the fact is, if you believe Ms. 
Gupta circa 2012, it is simply a lie. It is 
a lie under oath, potentially perjury. I 
mean, why do we swear witnesses in if 
some of them will take the burden of 
their oath so lightly and they would lie 
with impunity? I mean, what is the 
purpose? 
She didn’t just lie to me. She lied to 
Chairman DURBIN. She lied to Senator 
WHITEHOUSE. She lied to every member 
of the Judiciary Committee. And, un-
fortunately, she is lying to the Senate. 
She has been given many opportunities 
to reconcile these radically conflicting 
statements. These are diametrically 
opposed positions. If she had a good an-
swer, if she cared enough, if she re-
spected Members of the Senate enough, 
she would have provided us an answer 
rather than just an outright lie. 
Here is a fact check from the Wash-
ington Post, that great ultra or uber- 
conservative publication. As you can 
see, they gave her a unique Pinocchio 
award. I have never seen a Pinocchio 
award like this. Ordinarily, they would 
say, well, you get one, two, or three, or 
four Pinocchios based on whether or 
not we find this to be a misrepresenta-
tion of the facts or a lie. 
But here, they said: ‘‘For this tango 
of 
previously 
unacknowledged 
flip- 
flops, Gupta [deserves] an Upside-Down 
Pinocchio’’—‘‘Upside-Down 
Pinocchio.’’ They went on to say 
Vanita 
Gupta’s 
shifting 
views 
on 
defunding the police, decriminalizing 
drugs 
deserve 
this 
Upside-Down 
Pinocchio, March 10, 2021. 
If you published an op-ed saying the 
sky is purple and now you say the sky 
is blue, don’t tell us you never thought 
the sky was purple. Have a little more 
respect for your obligation for one of 
the highest positions in the Depart-
ment of Justice not to lie to the Judi-
ciary Committee or the Senate. Have 
the courage to tell us the truth and 
stop trying to deceive the Senate in 
order to be confirmed. 
As I said earlier, Ms. Gupta was a 
registered lobbyist and spent a good 
part of her career pushing a very spe-
cific agenda and a range of radical poli-
cies to go along with it. In the process, 
she disparaged individuals, organiza-
tions, and political parties who dared 
to oppose her beliefs. 
She wrote about the growing number 
of conservatives on the Federal bench 
and said: ‘‘Republicans have planted 
the seeds of this takeover for decades— 
and now, they are leaping into action.’’ 
I wonder if she realized she might one 
day be in a position of advocating on 
the Department of Justice before the 
very same judges that she has dispar-
aged. 
She tweeted that Justice Kavanaugh 
‘‘lied’’ to the Judiciary Committee and 
‘‘showed himself to be a partisan.’’ And 
she is going to represent the American 
people in the highest Court in the land, 
populated by Justices she has called a 
liar? Well, she has called a number of 
other Federal judges—she has described 
a number of them with similar disdain. 
Now, I find it hard to believe that 
these views, which are not from dec-
ades-old law school writings or that 
you can write off to immaturity or per-
haps satire—like we heard yesterday 
from Ms. CLARKE, who has been nomi-
nated to the civil rights division—these 
are recent public statements which 
this nominee no longer claims to hold. 
Like I said, if confirmed, she will su-
pervise litigation in front of the many 
Federal judges she has disparaged, and 
she will be in an extraordinarily power-
ful position to bend the Department of 
Justice to her political whims. 
Ms. Gupta is the daughter of a gen-
tleman who heads up a chemical com-
pany that produces all sorts of chemi-
cals for a variety of legitimate pur-
poses. It looks like, from her financial 
disclosure statement, he has been very 
successful and so has Ms. Gupta, in 
family trusts worth tens of millions of 
dollars, much of it including the stock 
of Avantor, the company that her fa-
ther heads. 
I realize Ms. Gupta is not personally 
responsible, as a shareholder in this 
company, but it is clear, I believe, from 
an investigative journalism story by 
Bloomberg dated September 2020 that 
Avantor was selling acetic anhydride, 
an essential ingredient in converting 
poppies to heroin, for at least the last 
decade. 
She owns tens of millions of dollars’ 
worth of that stock. 
I have asked the Attorney General 
and the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission to look into Avantor’s conduct 
because, if, in fact, an American chem-
ical manufacturer has been selling ace-
tic anhydride in the country where 
they know that it will be available to 
the criminal cartels and drug runners— 
and they should know that 92 percent 
of the heroin made in Mexico, using 
acetic 
anhydride, 
manufactured 
by 
Avantor and its subsidiary in Mexico— 
that is a serious, serious problem. So I 
have asked the Attorney General and 
the Department of Justice to look into 
it. 
Asked 
about 
this, 
asked 
about 
Avantor’s activities, Ms. Gupta said: 
‘‘I’m aware of the allegations.’’ 
I do not have faith, nor should the 
Senate have faith, nor should the 
American people have faith that Ms. 
Gupta will act fairly and impartially if 
confirmed to this position. If she was 
willing to lie to the American people 
during her confirmation hearings be-
fore the Judiciary Committee, imagine 
how she might treat others with dis-
dain, people who hold opposing views in 
our society, using the great weight and 
power of the Department of Justice 
perhaps to further some of her par-
tisan, political, ideological agenda. 
Can we really expect someone with 
this track record, this history, to live 
up to the highest ideals of the Justice 
Department? And, for example, we all 
know lawyers are taught that, if you 
have exculpatory information about a 
criminal defendant, you have a duty to 
disclose that to the other side. If you 
are the prosecutor, you have a duty to 
disclose it to the defendant so it can be 
cross-examined and used in the course 
of a jury trial. 
Do we really expect someone who ap-
pears willing to lie with such disregard 
for the truth to disclose exculpatory 
material that a person sued by the De-
partment of Justice would have a right 
to, or would she just try to sit on it? 
Can we really expect her to hire peo-
ple around her based on merit as op-
posed to some political litmus test? 
Can we really expect her to disclose 
material information to the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court or en-
courage folks under her supervision to 
be meticulous and forthright with the 
court when seeking warrants? I don’t 
think so. 
Given the incredible power of the De-
partment of Justice and all the tools 
available to it, Ms. Gupta’s radical be-
liefs and agenda—that she believes in 
sincerely, apparently—these would be 
more than words on a screen. Her views 
would be terribly dangerous to the 
American people. Based on her track 
record, I have no confidence in her 
ability to act with fairness, candor, or 
integrity. 
As a member of the bar, as a lawyer, 
you have a higher duty, than even a 
regular citizen, of candor. The model 
disciplinary rules that apply to law-
yers, members of the bar, like Ms. 
Gupta, who is a member of the New 
York bar as well as the Supreme Court 
bar—they are subject to discipline from 
grievance committees in those jurisdic-
tions. 
We know that they have real teeth 
because former President Clinton, as 
you may recall, lied under oath as a 
lawyer and was disbarred by the Ar-
kansas Bar Association and also had to 
give up his membership in the bar of 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States.

habit of allowing witnesses to come in

and lie under oath in such a brazen 
way, why do we even go through this 
Kabuki theater? Why do we require 
them to take an oath in the first place 
if you can lie with impunity? What is 
the point of going to these hearings if 
the witnesses are not going to be truth-
ful and answer our questions honestly? 
As I say, I have grave concerns about 
this nominee’s ability to separate her 
well-documented personal beliefs from 
her role as a high-ranking official at 
the Department of Justice. 
So it will come as no surprise that I 
will oppose discharging Ms. Gupta’s 
nomination from the committee. I 
think she should have to come back to 
the committee, as we have requested of 
Chairman DURBIN, to explain these in-
consistencies, if she has a good answer. 
So far, Chairman DURBIN has declined 
to provide her and us that opportunity. 
But if we want to maintain any sense 
of legitimacy and respect for the con-
firmation process, we need to hold peo-
ple accountable who come here and lie 
under oath. And for that and many 
other reasons, I will oppose the motion 
to discharge this nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before 
yielding to my colleague from Rhode 
Island, I would like to respond very 
briefly. 
My, have we come a long way since 
we had a President who, for 4 years, re-
fused to disclose his tax returns—first 
time ever. Oh, they are under audit. I 
will get back to you at some other 
time later. 
Now we have witnesses and nominees 
coming before the committee, sug-
gested by President Biden, who are pro-
ducing the documentation and the 
things that are being requested by this 
committee so that everyone knows the 
answers. 
So did Ms. Vanita Gupta produce 100 
pages of documents? No. Did she 
produce 1,000? No, she produced 11,000 
pages of documents, answering every 
question that was to be asked. And the 
suggestion the senior Senator from 
Texas raises—he raised it before in 
committee—that somehow, because her 
family made a business decision about 
selling a chemical, legally, into the na-
tion of Mexico, she should be held re-
sponsible as a shareholder or as a mem-
ber of the family? 
You will notice, if you listen very 
carefully to what the Senator said, he 
is not saying there was any wrong-
doing. He is saying there was an article 
once which made that allegation, and 
he has referred the question to others 
to decide. That is a long way from say-
ing Vanita Gupta is responsible for 
whatever the company did, if it did 
anything, wrong. She has made that 
full disclosure, and I think raising this 
is unfair, just fundamentally unfair. 
Secondly, on the question of decrimi-
nalizing drugs, narcotics, she says her 
position on it has evolved. Well, I think 
the Senator from Texas would be the 
first to acknowledge that the position 
of America has evolved on the question 
of drugs; has it not? Hasn’t the position 
of Texas recently evolved on the de-
criminalization of some drugs and the 
possession thereof? 
We are thinking differently about it. 
We are trying to find the most effec-
tive way to end addiction and save 
lives. We no longer want to lock every-
body up, nor should we. We are decid-
ing that there are some drug violations 
that shouldn’t merit any time in jail, 
that some people just need help to 
break their addiction. 
If Vanita Gupta has been part of that 
conversation in America over 9 or 10 
years, she is in good company. We have 
all been part of it. Virtually all of us 
have been part of it. 
And this notion of defunding the po-
lice—do you honestly believe the Fra-
ternal Order of Police would be endors-
ing her if she wanted to defund the po-
lice? 
She made it clear, as others have too, 
that reallocation of funds for law en-
forcement is just common sense. Put-
ting a social worker in a delicate situa-
tion, putting a psychologist in a deli-
cate situation, may spare a policeman 
a terrible choice that he has to make, 
and I think most of us agree that it is 
common sense. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island is recognized. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here to express my support for the 
nomination of Vanita Gupta to serve as 
Associate Attorney General. 
It is a little strange here on the floor 
today 
because 
under 
normal 
cir-
cumstances I would talk about Ms. 
Gupta’s exemplary record of service 
and how she will excel as the third in 
command of the Department of Justice 
and that she would be a consensus 
nominee. But the extraordinary effort 
to scuttle her nomination on a partisan 
basis in spite of her exemplary record 
asks some questions about what is 
going on here. 
Vanita Gupta is an accomplished 
lawyer with a record of working well 
with just about everyone. When she 
was last at the Department, working 
on really difficult issues like use-of- 
force guidelines for police, she built 
solid relationships with law enforce-
ment. So they have thrown their full- 
throated support behind her nomina-
tion. 
Here are the law enforcement agen-
cies and leaders that are supporting 
her: the Fraternal Order of Police; the 
Major County Sheriffs of America; the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police; the Major Cities Chiefs Associa-
tion; the Police Executive Research 
Forum; the Federal Law Enforcement 
Officers 
Association; 
the 
Hispanic 
American Police Command Officers As-
sociation; NOBLE, the National Orga-
nization of Black Law Enforcement Ex-
ecutives; and a whole array of distin-
guished law enforcement leaders. 
These are influential groups and re-
spected individuals, and, for some of 
my Republican colleagues, this kind of 
support from law enforcement is lit-
erally unbelievable. 
So here is what my colleague, the 
junior Senator from Arkansas, asked 
Ms. Gupta about all these law enforce-
ment endorsements during her con-
firmation hearing: ‘‘Did you, or anyone 
on your behalf or anyone in or affili-
ated with the Biden campaign transi-
tion or administration, pressure those 
organizations with threats of retalia-
tion if they did not support your nomi-
nation?’’ 
‘‘No, Senator,’’ she answered. 
And she wasn’t kidding. Law enforce-
ment doesn’t brook threats from crimi-
nals, let alone Presidential candidates 
and executive nominees seeking their 
endorsement. 
And, indeed, they stood up to dispute 
that insinuation. Here is what Jim 
Pasco, the executive director of the 
Fraternal Order of Police, said in re-
sponse: 
I was kind of shocked by it. If [the Sen-
ator] really suspects that, then he doesn’t 
really know the law enforcement organiza-
tions as well as he thinks he does, and he 
certainly doesn’t know Vanita Gupta as well 
as I know her. 
Chuck Wexler is the head of the Po-
lice Executive Research Forum, and 
here is how he responded: 
Do you really think you can stand up to 
law enforcement and threaten them? Do you 
really think that’s going to work? We never 
forgot that she stood with us when it 
mattered. 
That is the reason for her support 
from law enforcement: She stood with 
them when it mattered. And to say 
that she is such a radical and so 
against law enforcement and disdains 
those who disagree with her—which 
would presumably be law enforcement, 
if she is such an anti-law-enforcement 
radical, as my colleagues suggest—is 
completely blown to smithereens by 
their continued support for her—not 
disdain: ‘‘She stood with us when it 
mattered.’’ 
So when that effort to blow her up 
exploded in their face, colleagues went 
after an op-ed that she authored 9 
years ago in which she supported de-
criminalization and defelonization of 
simple possession of small amounts of 
drugs. It could be read to say decrimi-
nalization of marijuana—other drugs, 
small amounts. 
Well, we know a lot today about sub-
stance abuse that we didn’t know then 
that people who have addictions re-
quire treatment and care, not punish-
ment and incarceration. That is no rad-
ical position. The idea that you should 
not prosecute people for possession of 
small amounts is the basis of drug 
courts. 
I started the drug court in Rhode Is-
land. It has been a roaring success. It is 
the basis for diversion programs. As at-
torney general of my State with full 
criminal jurisdiction in my State of 
Rhode Island, we constantly did diver-
sion of cases of possession of small 
amounts of drugs—all kinds of drugs—

because they don’t belong in the crimi-
nal justice system. They get swept up, 
and you divert them out before pros-
ecution. 
This is nothing peculiar or unusual. 
This is the position of the World 
Health Organization. This is the posi-
tion of the Organization of American 
States. This is the position of the 
International Red Cross. Heck, even 
former Speaker Boehner supported de-
criminalization of simple possession of 
some or all drugs. 
So they had to get into rhetorical 
tricks to try to make the point look 
different than it actually is. And Re-
publicans repeatedly asked her ques-
tions about that statement regarding 
small amounts with respect to what 
they call here ‘‘the legalization of ‘all 
drugs.’’’ In response to that, she said: 
I have never advocated for the legalization 
or decriminalization of all drugs, and I do 
not support the legalization or decrimi-
nalization of all drugs. 
If I were to come up to you, Mr. 
President, and say ‘‘Do you support the 
legalization or decriminalization of all 
drugs?’’ what will you take that ques-
tion to mean? It would seem to mean 
blanket decriminalization or legaliza-
tion of all drugs, not small amounts— 
all. 
Well, they went on in this same vein. 
Here is a question for the record from 
Senator HAWLEY
describing Senator 
CORNYN’s question ‘‘whether you advo-
cate decriminalization of all drugs.’’ 
That is not what she advocated. What 
she advocated was decriminalization of 
small amounts—consistent with diver-
sion, consistent with drug court activ-
ity, consistent with the way the sub-
stance abuse and recovery community 
treats this issue, and consistent with 
the position of all those organizations 
and many, many more. This is the way 
we operate in law enforcement these 
days. 
So then they try to focus in on the 
word ‘‘never.’’ Senator CORNYN, who 
was speaking on the floor a moment 
ago, ominously said to me, the most 
important 
word 
in 
that 
quote 
is 
‘‘never.’’ As you can see, it is simply a 
misrepresentation of what she said in 
2012. 
Well, you could also argue—‘‘I have 
never advocated for the decriminaliza-
tion of all drugs.’’ You could also argue 
that the key word in that sentence 
isn’t ‘‘never’’; it is ‘‘all.’’ That is the 
subject of the sentence: ‘‘all drugs.’’ 
Kilos of cocaine, pounds of meth-
amphetamine—no. Small, simple pos-
session amounts—that is the way ev-
erybody treats drugs in law enforce-
ment these days. 
As lawyers, we know that it is impor-
tant to get the question right, and it is 
not unusual for lawyers to flub the 
question. When you are asking a ques-
tion in court and you flub the question, 
you often get an answer you don’t like, 
and the remedy for that is not to call 
the witness who answered your ques-
tion a liar. The remedy for that is to 
get the question right in the first 
place. And if the question is whether 
Vanita Gupta advocated decriminaliza-
tion of all drugs, the answer is, in fact, 
no because small amounts of simple 
possession is a very different thing 
than ‘‘all drugs.’’ 
And now they are hanging this ex-
traordinary rampart of invective—liar, 
deliberate liar—all over getting an 
honest answer to a question that they 
asked badly or, perhaps, worse yet, a 
trick question intended to trip her up 
that she answered honestly. 
So what is going on? Why are they 
going through this exercise? Well, step 
back a little bit and look what is going 
on in our country. The first thing that 
is going on is that there is a massive 
dark money campaign for voter sup-
pression. There is a guy named Leon-
ard Leo who ran the dark money cam-
paign that pushed three Supreme Court 
Justices onto the Court. The Wash-
ington Post reported that as a $250 mil-
lion effort—$250 million. 
After the Washington Post article 
came out and Leonard Leo was blown 
like a covert agent who suddenly is 
identified with all of this, he has to get 
out. Where does he go? He goes to 
something called the Honest Elections 
Project, which is the sister organiza-
tion of a group called the Judicial Cri-
sis Network, which—guess what—is 
running ads against Vanita Gupta. 
They used to run ads for the Supreme 
Court nominees. They spent tens of 
millions of dollars running ads against 
Garland, for Gorsuch, for Kavanaugh, 
for Barrett—tens of millions of dollars. 
But with Biden in the White House, no-
body is listening to them any longer. 
They are not getting their appointees 
through, so they moved to voter sup-
pression. And all that money and that 
same guy, Leonard Leo, are now lined 
up behind voter suppression. 
So you get dark money ads paid for 
by Judicial Crisis Network against the 
third-ranking person in the Depart-
ment of Justice? They are used to 
going for the Supreme Court. They are 
going after the third-ranking person at 
the Department of Justice. Why? Be-
cause it is voter suppression—because 
she has been the head of the Civil 
Rights 
Division, 
which 
prosecuted 
voter suppression. She knows that 
stuff. 
She 
will 
supervise 
Kristen 
Clarke, whom you will hear a lot more 
nonsense about from the other side, 
who will run the Civil Rights Division 
and sue for voter suppression. 
So what this is really about is the 
voter suppression project that you see 
alive and well in the country from the 
Republican Party. There are reports 
that say that every single legislative 
body in the country controlled by Re-
publicans is pushing voter suppression 
measures. I don’t know that it is true, 
but it sure looks like it is true. And if 
not, it is darn close. It is a pattern. 
Wherever you go in the country, Re-
publicans 
in 
charge—boom—restrict 
the ballot. 
They know people don’t like what 
they stand for. They know people can’t 
stand the dark money forces behind ads 
like this. So the secret, as my distin-
guished colleague Senator WARNOCK 
said: Some people don’t want some peo-
ple to vote. 
So the two women who will be over-
seeing the Department of Justice voter 
suppression resistance, the legal fight 
against voter suppression, the enforce-
ment of the Civil Rights Act, are being 
subjected to this treatment. 
On this, I will stand with Ms. Gupta. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Daily Beast, Mar. 22, 2021] 
HOW RIGHT-WING DARK MONEY IS TRYING TO 
KNEECAP THE BIDEN DOJ 
(By Sheldon Whitehouse) 
Someone is targeting Biden Justice De-
partment 
nominees 
Vanita 
Gupta 
and 
Kristen Clarke with attacks. Why? Both 
nominees hold exceptional records as litiga-
tors and civils rights activists. The respect 
they’ve earned extends beyond the civil 
rights movement and progressives to law en-
forcement and leading conservatives. They 
ought to be consensus picks. 
But pull back the curtain, and strategy 
and motive take shape. Gupta and Clarke are 
poised to use their skills to defend Ameri-
cans’ right to vote, just as the Republican 
Party is going all in on voter suppression as 
its path to political victory in 2022. 
Unraveling the strategy starts with the 
dark-money group running the ads: the so- 
called Judicial Crisis Network (JCN). This 
group’s ordinary work has been to translate 
big donors’ money into political attack ads 
in the ‘‘Court capture’’ mission that set out 
to remake the Supreme Court to the donors’ 
advantage. JCN has placed more than 10,000 
ads since 2012 in pursuit of that mission, and 
they’ve kept secret the identity of those big 
donors. 
In Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell’s 
courtpacking machine, this Judicial Crisis 
Network spent $7 million to oppose President 
Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick 
Garland, and then spent another $10 million 
to boost Trump’s nominee Neil Gorsuch. JCN 
pledged $10 million or more for Brett 
Kavanaugh’s nomination. It spent $10 mil-
lion in under two months to support Amy 
Coney Barrett’s bid. These campaigns were 
funded with tens of millions of anonymous 
dollars, primarily through four separate do-
nations of at least $15 million. Those dona-
tions may well have been the same donor. 
Eye-popping as that is, those millions are 
a tiny slice of the funding behind the overall 
dark-money operation. A 2019 Washington 
Post investigation revealed JCN is one of a 
web of front groups coordinated by Leonard 
Leo, the long-time executive vice president 
of the Federalist Society. 
The Post tracked more than $250 million in 
dark money flowing through Leo’s groups. 
The groups see to the grooming and selec-
tion of reliable nominees, the lobbyists need-
ed to shepherd nominees through confirma-
tion, and the attack ads to motivate the con-
firmation votes. Then, more groups lobby 
the selected judges through amicus curiae 
briefs, signaling how their donors want the 
judges to rule. 
The dark-money network has won an ava-
lanche of victories for its donors. There are 
80 partisan, 5–4 Supreme Court decisions that 
limit workers’ rights and access to reproduc-
tive health care, erode environmental pro-
tections, block commonsense gun safety 
laws, undermine civil rights, and protect cor-
porations from courtrooms. It is an astound-
ing 80–0 rout for big right-wing donors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1973 
April 15, 2021 
After The Washington Post exposed the 
$250 million operation, Leo stepped back 
from his Federalist Society role and turned 
up at a new organization improbably named 
the Honest Elections Project. This project 
began voter suppression work in political 
swing states like Florida, Nevada, Wisconsin, 
and Michigan that included: negative ads 
against Democrats; threatening letters to 
election officials challenging voter rolls; and 
a barrage of lawsuits seeking voting restric-
tions for November’s election. 
‘‘Trump’s cronies at the Justice Depart-
ment showed dark-money donors the value of 
a captive Department that would look away 
from voter suppression schemes.’’ 
The media soon uncovered that the Honest 
Elections Project was a rebrand of the Judi-
cial Education Project—which shared con-
nections, donors, and aims with its sister 
group—yes, the Judicial Crisis Network. As a 
reporter for The Guardian observed, the Hon-
est Elections Project melds two goals of the 
right-wing dark-money operation: first, pack 
the federal judiciary; and second, bring vot-
ing rights cases before the packed courts. 
Rigging elections through the courts is now 
a Republican judicial priority. 
This brings us back to Gupta and Clarke. 
Gupta once ran the Civil Rights Division. 
She prosecuted hate crimes and human traf-
ficking, promoted disability and LGBTQ 
rights, and fought discrimination in edu-
cation, housing, employment, lending, and 
religious exercise. But most important, she 
challenged voter suppression. Gupta, if con-
firmed as assistant attorney general, will su-
pervise the Civil Rights Division she once 
ran. 
Accomplished civil rights attorney Clarke 
will fill Gupta’s former role running the Di-
vision and enforcing voting rights. The Hon-
est Elections Project, kin to the Judicial 
Crisis Network, wants no part of these two 
women, because they will be strong, moti-
vated leaders against unlawful voter suppres-
sion. They preferred Trump’s Civil Rights 
Division, which didn’t bring one single Vot-
ing Rights Act case until late May of 2020. 
That’s the motive. The donor-approved Re-
publican appointees to the Supreme Court 
may handcuff the Civil Rights Division with 
further judicial assaults on voting rights. 
But Trump’s cronies at the Justice Depart-
ment showed dark-money donors the value of 
a captive Department that would look away 
from voter suppression schemes. As Repub-
licans hinge their election strategy on keep-
ing Americans from voting, an active Civil 
Rights Division is a deadly threat. 
I get it. If I were a right-wing special inter-
est group, the last thing I would want is 
these two experienced lawyers wielding the 
power of the Justice Department to defend 
voting rights. But for everybody else, these 
women are two appointments to applaud. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Ten-
nessee is recognized. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I find it so interesting that my 
friend and colleague across the aisle is 
trying to deflect questions and con-
cerns that we have by insinuations and 
some pretty disgusting slander, and I 
am sorry that we have listened to that 
here on the floor of this Chamber. 
Yes, indeed, I am coming to the floor 
today to oppose discharging Vanita 
Gupta from this floor to be confirmed 
as the Associate Attorney General. 
And, yes, I have concerns. I have had 
questions in committee. 
I will tell you I didn’t expect to find 
a lot in common with her because I 
have had a difficult time finding a lot 
in common with some of the nominees 
that President Biden has sent over to 
us at Judiciary Committee. But as a 
member of that committee, it is my re-
sponsibility to approach each nomina-
tion with an open mind. Some I have 
decided were worthy of an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
There are others, like Ms. Gupta, that 
I feel are not worthy of a confirmation 
vote. 
Over the course of the review of in-
formation—and to my friend, the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee, 11,000 
pages of documents—you can send in a 
million pages of documents, but if you 
are not answering the question, if you 
are trying to circumvent the question 
or nuance it or dance around it, it still 
doesn’t answer the question. So the 
volume doesn’t really matter. 
What matters is someone who steps 
up and says: Here is my answer—clear, 
concise. That is what you want, and 
that is what the American people ex-
pect. 
I arrived at the opinion that, no, I 
didn’t think she was fit to take that 
No. 3 position, not because I disagreed 
politically but because the answers 
that she gave on some specific issues— 
police funding, drug legalization, quali-
fied immunity—were so inconsistent 
with what she had previously said or 
what she had previously written that 
no one can say with any degree of cer-
tainty what she will do with the new-
found power if we decided to give that 
to her. No one knows what she would 
do. 
Due to the time constraints we have 
on the floor today, I want to go back to 
the 2012 article and use that as one ex-
ample. There has been quite a bit said 
about that. Now, she was in the posi-
tion of the ACLU’s deputy legal direc-
tor. She wrote an op-ed arguing—and I 
quote, and we have just heard a good 
bit about this—‘‘States should decrimi-
nalize simple possession of all drugs, 
particularly marijuana, and for small 
amounts of other drugs.’’ That is a 
quote. 
Speaking as a Senator representing 
the interests of a State struggling to 
emerge from the opioid epidemic, this 
statement to me is a disqualifier. It is 
as simple as that. 
Senator CORNYN added to that con-
versation with other specific items 
that have transpired in her past. In her 
hearing, which took place in March, 
Ms. Gupta almost got away with dis-
avowing that op-ed. But when we 
pressed her on it, what did she have to 
say? That her position had evolved. 
It seems there is an issue with some 
of these nominees that are coming be-
fore us. They are going through these 
just in time, road to Damascus, evo-
lution processes. All of a sudden, they 
are evolving to a position of something 
that they think the committee wants 
to hear, that they think will help them 
skirt through, that they think will 
help them get confirmed so that they 
can hold the power. 
Ms. Gupta has also evolved on crimi-
nal justice reform, on the fundamen-
tals for that. And as we have discussed 
on this floor today, the fact checkers 
have had a pretty good time with that. 
Back in March, the Washington Post 
took her to task—Senator CORNYN 
talked about this—her evolving posi-
tion, her shifting views on defunding 
the police, decriminalization of drugs. 
This is the Washington Post. This is 
the Washington Post that gave her the 
unusual upside-down Pinocchio because 
she was flip-flopping and evolving at 
such a rapid rate, they couldn’t keep 
up with it. 
Madam President, everyone has the 
right and the opportunity to change 
their mind. Absolutely, people have the 
right to change their mind, but trying 
to follow the many changes of her mind 
on the issue of drug crimes, on decrimi-
nalization, on defunding police—these 
are important issues to our commu-
nities. These are not a game. These are 
very important issues to the safety and 
security of our communities. 
The number of inconsistencies in her 
testimony more than test the bound-
aries of understanding. Is she still 
evolving? Is she going to flip-flop, as 
the Washington Post says, back to her 
previous opinions of 2012? Is she going 
to flip-flop again? Would we see that in 
the next 11,000 pages of documents that 
were submitted that she has decided to 
change her mind one more time? From 
what standard is she going to work at 
the Department of Justice? 
Each of these are concerns. Each of 
these are reasons that my hope is that 
this Chamber will refuse to discharge 
Vanita Gupta for a confirmation vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, before my distinguished friend’s 
speech, I ask unanimous consent to 
have an article appended as an exhibit 
to the remarks I gave earlier. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
REMEMBERING DOUGLAS BURTELL 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, 12 
days ago, on April 3, we brought sad 
news of the passing of Douglas Burtell, 
of Bowman, ND, the last known World 
War II veteran residing in my State 
from the legendary 164th Infantry 
Regiment of the North Dakota Na-
tional Guard. Tomorrow would have 
been his 97th birthday, April 16. I join 
in remembering and honoring him and 
the generation of heroes he represents 
to our State and to our Nation. 
Douglas Burtell joined the National 
Guard in Fargo at the age of 16. In Feb-
ruary of 1942, 2 months after the attack 
on Pearl Harbor, this Casselton native 
was among the 1,723 young men to mo-
bilize in the 164th Infantry Regiment. 
Ten months later, the regiment sailed 
into history as the first U.S. Army unit 
to offensively engage the enemy in the 
Pacific when they landed at Guadal-
canal on October 13, 1942. There they 
reinforced the 1st Marine Division and 
spent more than 600 days in the combat 
zone until August 1945.

His talent for illustration was no-
ticed at the national regiment head-
quarters, where he was trained in intel-
ligence and reconnaissance. There he 
interpreted aerial photography, ana-
lyzed captured materials, and drew 
maps based on patrol reconnaissance 
reports. His service included combat on 
the Philippine Islands, Bougainville, 
and Guadalcanal, and he received the 
Purple Heart after being wounded in 
action. 
Returning to North Dakota after the 
war, Mr. Burtell earned his high school 
GED, attended art school in Min-
neapolis, and spent much of his life in 
lumber, millwork, and camper sales in 
Fargo. He spent his last years living 
near his daughter in Bowman, ND. 
Often attending reunions of the 164th 
Regiment Infantry Association, he was 
present at its final gathering in Octo-
ber 2017. He helped relatives of other 
veterans with research about the war 
experiences of their loved ones. 
And he painted throughout his life, 
generously 
sharing 
his 
work 
with 
friends. Mr. Burtell’s artwork helped 
tell the everyday stories of the soldiers 
as they fought their way through the 
South Pacific. His illustrations are a 
lasting testament to the heroic con-
tributions of the 164th Infantry Regi-
ment to World War II. He was honored 
in March when North Dakota Adjutant 
General, Major General Al Dohrmann 
announced one of his sketches would be 
featured on a new recognition coin. 
Other artwork is etched in granite on 
the 164th Infantry Regiment Memorial 
located at the North Dakota Veterans 
Cemetery near Mandan, which is now 
Mr. Burtell’s final resting place. 
Madam President, on behalf of all 
Dakotans and a grateful nation, I offer 
my deepest condolences to Douglas 
Burtell’s family and friends, including 
his daughter and son-in-law, Barb and 
Steve Conley, his two granddaughters, 
and five great-grandchildren. 
Today, with most of our World War II 
veterans now gone, Mr. Burtell’s art-
work preserves the faces of so many 
brave North Dakotans and exemplifies 
their patriotism and dedication. 
The 164th Infantry Regiment’s motto 
in French, ‘‘Je Suis Pret,’’ ‘‘I Am 
Ready,’’ inspires today’s North Dakota 
National Guard motto of ‘‘Always 
Ready, Always There.’’ God bless the 
memory of Douglas Burtell and the 
brave soldiers of World War II who 
were always ready. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
NOMINATIONS OF VANITA GUPTA AND KRISTEN 
CLARKE 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to express concerns over two of 
the Democrats’ nominees. There have 
been a number of questionable nomi-
nees put forth by this new administra-
tion, but these two nominees may be 
the two most radical nominees put 
forth. 
First, I would like to talk about 
Vanita Gupta. Today, we are set to 
vote on discharging Vanita Gupta’s 
nomination out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee because Ms. Gupta could not 
garner a majority vote in the com-
mittee on moving her nomination for-
ward to the full Senate. 
The Judiciary Committee is dead-
locked and for good reason. This nomi-
nee’s record is that of an extreme par-
tisan ideologue. I can assure the Amer-
ican people, Ms. Gupta is not a mod-
erate, is not mainstream but is, rather, 
an extreme political activist whom the 
Democrats want to be the No. 3 lawyer 
at the Department of Justice. 
When she testified before the Judici-
ary Committee last month, she consist-
ently dodged questions. She wouldn’t 
answer if she supported any restric-
tions, whatsoever, on abortion. She 
wouldn’t 
answer—not 
partial-birth 
abortion, not anything. 
When it comes to the Second Amend-
ment, I asked Ms. Gupta if she thought 
the Heller decision, the landmark deci-
sion upholding the individual right to 
keep and bear arms, if that decision 
was rightly decided. She refused to an-
swer that question. 
For years, she has demonstrated a 
persistent hostility to religious liberty, 
such as when she defended the Obama 
administration’s targeting and perse-
cution of the Little Sisters of the Poor. 
Not too long ago, religious liberty was 
a bipartisan commitment in this body. 
The Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act was introduced by then-Represent-
ative CHUCK SCHUMER, now the Senate 
majority leader. It had passed the 
House unanimously. It passed the Sen-
ate 93 to 3 and was signed into law by 
Democratic President Bill Clinton. 
Sadly, today’s Democratic Party has 
abandoned religious liberty. That is no 
longer a commitment. Instead, today’s 
Democratic Party embraces extreme 
ideas like the Equality Act, which has 
just come out of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It is a radical piece of leg-
islation that, among other things, ex-
plicitly repeals major parts of the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act de-
signed to take away your religious lib-
erty. 
Ms. Gupta has been a vocal defender 
of the misnamed Equality Act. She lob-
bied for its passage, a fact that she 
didn’t disclose to the committee ini-
tially. When she was before the Judici-
ary Committee, I asked if she agreed 
with the provisions of the Equality Act 
that take away religious liberty pro-
tections from Americans. Again, Ms. 
Gupta refused to answer that question, 
too. 
Ms. Gupta has demonstrated radical 
hostility to school choice, so much so 
that when she served in the Depart-
ment of Justice during the Obama- 
Biden administration, she helped inter-
vene in a case trying to kill a Lou-
isiana school choice program, even 
though many of the African-American 
parents in Louisiana strongly sup-
ported and desperately needed that 
program. The Federal court involved in 
this case even reprimanded the Depart-
ment of Justice under her leadership 
for ineffective lawyering in this case. 
At the Judiciary hearing of Ms. 
Gupta last month, I asked if she regret-
ted using the Department of Justice to 
fight against the school choice pro-
gram that was providing hope and op-
portunity to low-income minority kids 
in Louisiana. Again, she refused to pro-
vide a straightforward answer. 
When it comes to defunding the po-
lice, it is here that Ms. Gupta is most 
radical. Last year, Ms. Gupta, in a 
written filing with this Senate, encour-
aged Congress to ‘‘reexamine Federal 
spending priorities and shrink the foot-
print of the police and criminal legal 
system in this country.’’ She also en-
couraged reallocating resources, writ-
ing, ‘‘Some people call it ‘defunding 
the police,’ other people call it ‘divest- 
invest,’ but whatever you call it, if you 
care about mass incarceration, you 
have to care about skewed funding pri-
orities.’’ 
These weren’t Ms. Gupta’s college 
writings. These weren’t scribblings on 
a Post-it she made somewhere. These 
statements were from last year, sub-
mitted to the U.S. Senate. And on their 
face and unequivocally, they advocate 
for defunding the police. 
There is no question on her record 
that Ms. Gupta is a hard-left partisan 
radical whose beliefs don’t align with 
the majority of the American people. 
So why are Democrats so hell-bent on 
making sure she gets confirmed? Two 
reasons. 
Reason No. 1: Headlines. Democrats 
care so deeply about looking good in 
the press, they continue to press 
through partisan bills and partisan ac-
tivists for adulation by adoring media. 
Reason No. 2: Today’s Democrats are 
beholden to the far-left voices in their 
party, and they are fulfilling campaign 
promises that they made to the radical 
left. 
That is why they nominated Ms. 
Gupta, and that is why they broke Ju-
diciary Committee rules to move for-
ward her nomination. Rule 4 of the 
committee, preserves the right of mi-
nority members to speak before a vote. 
It only allows for stopping debate and 
bringing a matter to a vote if a major-
ity of the committee agrees, including 
at least one member of the minority 
party. 
But the Democrats didn’t have a ma-
jority. If they had tried to bring a mat-
ter to the vote under the rules, the 
vote would have failed. So, instead, 
Chairman DURBIN unilaterally silenced 
and stopped a member of the com-
mittee from speaking, midsentence, 
and forced a vote. He did so in flatout 
violation of the rules, without even a 
pretense of a justification under the 
rules. 
The chairman knew that this was an 
abuse of power. Every Democrat on the 
committee knew it was an abuse of 
power. It was an abuse of power that 
had never been done against them 
when Republicans had the gavel for 6 
years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1975 
April 15, 2021 
Yet today’s Democrats are about 
power. So if the rules stand in the way, 
to heck with the rules. Ignore them. 
That is what the Senate Democrats did 
on the Judiciary Committee. 
I also want to talk about Kristen 
Clarke, who has been likewise nomi-
nated to a senior position at the De-
partment of Justice. 
Like Ms. Gupta, Ms. CLARKE’s record 
is that of an extreme radical. Last 
year, she wrote an op-ed in Newsweek, 
entitled: ‘‘I Prosecuted Police Killings. 
Defund the Police—But Be Strategic.’’ 
In that op-ed, Ms. CLARKE
wrote 
about the protests that erupted last 
year and stated: 
Into that space has surged a unifying call 
from the Black Lives Matter movement: 
‘‘Defund the police.’’ 
Now, like Ms. Gupta, she tried to run 
away from her record. At the prompt-
ing of Senate Democrats and at the 
prompting of Chairman DURBIN, Ms. 
CLARKE said: No, no, no, no, no. I don’t 
support defunding the police. She said: 
You know, it was just the headline of 
the article. I didn’t write the headline. 
Ms. Gupta did the same thing. Both of 
them were instructed by their handlers 
to backpedal as quickly as possible 
from their repeated and explicit advo-
cacy in writing. So Ms. CLARKE says 
she doesn’t support defunding the po-
lice. 
Yesterday, when Ms. CLARKE came 
before the Judiciary Committee, I 
asked her straightforwardly if she still 
thinks ‘‘defund the police’’ is a uni-
fying call. That is what she wrote not 
10 years ago, not 5 years ago but last 
year. She wouldn’t answer the ques-
tion. Instead, she just repeated her 
talking 
point: 
‘‘I 
do 
not 
support 
defunding the police.’’ 
As I told Ms. CLARKE yesterday, that 
claim is objectively ridiculous. She as-
serted she doesn’t advocate cutting the 
funding of police, which on its face was 
a lie. 
In that same op-ed she wrote in 
Newsweek, there are no fewer than 
three separate paragraphs that begin 
with the following words: ‘‘We must in-
vest less in the police’’—three para-
graphs in a row. Now, when you write 
three paragraphs that begin with ‘‘We 
must invest less in the police; we must 
invest less in the police; we must in-
vest less in the police,’’ you don’t get 
to come and say: I don’t support in-
vesting less in the police. That is objec-
tively absurd, but, sadly, it is even 
worse. 
Not only is Ms. CLARKE an extreme 
advocate for defunding the police, but 
she has a history of not just excusing 
but of celebrating murderers who have 
murdered police officers. It has been 
widely reported that, in college, Ms. 
CLARKE helped to organize a conference 
with speakers who referred to con-
victed cop killers as ‘‘political pris-
oners.’’ This included Mumia Abu- 
Jamal, who murdered a Philadelphia 
police officer, and Assata Shakur, who 
was convicted of murdering a New Jer-
sey State trooper, who escaped from 
prison, and is on the FBI’s Most Want-
ed list. Multiple speakers at the con-
ference thanked Ms. CLARKE by name 
for inviting them to speak, and now 
the Democrats want Ms. CLARKE
to 
head the Civil Rights Division of the 
Department of Justice. 
I ask you the question that I asked 
Ms. CLARKE yesterday: What is a police 
officer in Philadelphia who is watching 
the proceedings before this body or a 
police officer in New Jersey who is 
watching C–SPAN today supposed to 
think about the Democrats nominating 
someone to a senior position at the De-
partment of Justice, knowing that this 
individual participated in a conference 
celebrating and lionizing cop killers 
who murdered a Philadelphia cop and 
murdered a New Jersey State Trooper? 
How should a police officer today react 
to that news? 
There are numerous Members of this 
body—Senate Democrats—who, when 
they go home to their States, like to 
tell their constituents they are not all 
that liberal; they are really quite rea-
sonable; they are really quite mod-
erate. Well, the nice thing about poli-
tics is that actions speak much more 
loudly than words. These two nomina-
tions—Ms. Gupta’s, which we have be-
fore us right now, and Ms. CLARKE’s, 
which I expect we will have before us 
relatively soon—are two of the most 
radical nominees ever to be put for-
ward. Indeed, you could call the two of 
them the radical twins. They are zeal-
ots; they are ideologues; and they both 
are leading advocates for abolishing 
the police. 
I say to my Democratic friends: This 
is a 50–50 Senate. That means just one 
of you—just 1 out of 50—could say: OK. 
Enough is enough. 
How many Senate Democrats have 
gone home and said, ‘‘I don’t support 
abolishing the police’’? Quite a few 
Senate Democrats, I suspect, are tell-
ing their constituents back home that 
they don’t support abolishing the po-
lice. 
Today, you have a vote because I will 
tell you, if you as a Senator vote to 
confirm the radical twins, both of 
whom are among the leading advocates 
for abolishing the police, your con-
stituents back home will know exactly 
where you stand on abolishing the po-
lice. You don’t get to put radicals who 
want to abolish the police in the top 
positions of the Department of Justice 
and claim you oppose abolishing the 
police. 
President Obama nominated for a 
senior position in the Department of 
Justice another lawyer who had cele-
brated and defended a cop killer, who 
had lionized a cop killer, and this body, 
in one of the few instances, decided 
that was too much; that was too far; 
and they were not going to confirm 
that lawyer. 
Unfortunately, the Democratic Party 
has changed. The Democratic Party 
today is radicalized. They hate Donald 
Trump. Now, I understand Donald 
Trump is a unique character. I under-
stand that his existence and every 
word he uttered enraged the Demo-
crats, but they have emerged from 4 
years of the Trump administration 
more radical than any majority party 
in this body ever has been. There are 
quite a few Democrats who, when they 
are at home, like to pretend otherwise. 
Today is a perfect opportunity to 
demonstrate that the pretense is not 
mere empty words. In fact, if you don’t 
support abolishing the police, then 
don’t support abolishing the police, and 
if you don’t support celebrating cop 
killers, then don’t confirm people who 
have celebrated cop killers to senior 
positions in the U.S. Department of 
Justice. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF HIRING ROBERT MONT-
GOMERY 
‘‘BOBBY’’ 
KNIGHT 
AS 
THE HEAD COACH OF THE MEN’S 
BASKETBALL TEAM AT INDIANA 
UNIVERSITY 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I rise 
to honor the 50th anniversary of the 
signing of Coach Robert Montgomery 
Knight at Indiana University, who set 
the standard for excellence as a colle-
giate men’s basketball coach. 
Coach Knight had a legendary career 
as a college head coach for more than 
40 years, 29 of which were at Indiana 
University. During those 29 years, 
Coach Knight had 11 Big Ten Con-
ference championship teams, took 24 
teams to the NCAA tournament, and 
earned 8 Big Ten Coach of the Year 
Awards. His 1975–1976 team at IU re-
mains the last team to complete an 
undefeated season and win every game 
in the NCAA tournament. They got 
close this year. 
Maureen, my wife, attended IU, and I 
can remember what a thrill it was to 
watch his teams play. Their drive and 
will to succeed were infectious. Coach 
Knight’s success at IU continues to be 
a source of pride for the entire State of 
Indiana. Coach Knight never focused 
his coaching on winning a game but on 
the effort it takes to become a cham-
pion, saying that the will to succeed is 
important, but the will to prepare is 
even more important. 
Due to his focus on his players’ suc-
cess on and off the court—this is amaz-
ing—Coach Knight had an astounding 
98-percent graduation rate for all play-
ers whom he coached for at least 4 
years—more than twice the average 
graduation rate for Division 1 schools. 
On the world stage, Coach Knight led 
the U.S. men’s national basketball 
team to a Gold Medal in the 1979 Pan 
Am Games and to a Gold Medal in the 
1984 Olympic Games. 
Victory is fleeting, but Coach Knight 
both 
propelled 
young 
men 
toward 
greatness on the court and gave them 
experiences and lessons that have 
shaped their entire lives. 
We honor the drive, determination, 
and character of Coach Knight and all

that he did in educating and mentoring 
hundreds of Indiana University players 
over three decades to bring pride to the 
State of Indiana. 
For all the memories, Coach Knight, 
we give you a heartfelt thank you. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 157, submitted earlier 
today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 157) honoring the 50th 
anniversary of hiring Robert Montgomery 
‘‘Bobby’’ Knight as the Head Coach of the 
men’s basketball team at Indiana Univer-
sity. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. BRAUN. I know of no further de-
bate on the measure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
agreeing to the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 157) was 
agreed to. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the preamble be agreed to 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The preamble was agreed to.

printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. BRAUN. I yield the floor. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what 
is it about these nominees Vanita 
Gupta and Kristen Clarke that drives 
some of the Members on the other side 
of the aisle into a rage? Listen to how 
they describe them. 
The senior Senator from Texas de-
scribes Vanita Gupta as a political 
‘‘culture warrior,’’ slandering and vili-
fying people. Then, of course, the jun-
ior Senator from Texas calls her an 
‘‘extreme partisan ideologue.’’ ‘‘Rad-
ical twins,’’ he calls them. 
What is it about these two nominees 
that drives them into such a state of 
mind that they say these things about 
individuals seeking an opportunity to 
again serve our Federal Government? 
It is amazing to me that the junior 
Senator from Texas suggests that they 
are in the thrall of handlers. Handlers. 
If you heard the story of the lives of 
these two women and what they have 
overcome to be where they are today, 
the last thing in the world you would 
use is a reference to handlers. They 
have defied handlers all throughout 
their lives—sons of immigrants, daugh-
ters of immigrants. Like so many of 
them, they know they have to work 
hard to prove themselves, and they 
have done it time and again. 
Vanita Gupta. Can you picture that 
moment when the civil rights organiza-
tions said to Vanita Gupta: We want 
you to go to Tulia, TX, because some-
thing has happened there that looks 
like a terrible miscarriage of justice. 
Forty people have been arrested for 
drug crimes in Tulia, TX, and we want 
you to go down there, even though they 
are in jail and they have been con-
victed, and defend them and try to find 
a way that they will be released. 
That is exactly what Vanita Gupta 
did. The net result was that they were 
not only released, but the lawman who 
had supposedly found them guilty was 
the one who was discredited and dis-
honored when it was over, and the 
Texas Governor—the Republican Texas 
Governor—acknowledged it with a par-
don of these individuals and paying 
them millions of dollars for what they 
had 
lived 
through. 
Who 
led 
that 
charge? Vanita Gupta. Was she waiting 
for a message from a handler? No. She 
showed extraordinary courage there 
and throughout her life as an attorney 
fighting for the civil rights of others 
and as an attorney representing the 
Government of the United States of 
America and the Department of Jus-
tice. 
When I listen to efforts to discredit 
her and her professionalism, I think, 
you haven’t read the story. You would 
know in a second she doesn’t wait to 
hear from a handler. She never has. 
She has shown exceptional courage and 
professionalism every step of the way. 
Kristen Clarke, the same. Born in an 
area of New York City that I am sure 
Senator SCHUMER knows, in a public 
tenement type of building, she over-
came all the odds. She graduated from 
law school and served in the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
When the junior Senator from Texas 
comes and refers to Vanita Gupta and 
Kristen Clarke as ‘‘radical twins,’’ zeal-
ots, ideologues, it is disgusting. It is 
terrible. It is a terrible reference to a 
fine life that each of them has lived. 
And this notion that somehow they 
have fooled the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice into believing that they really do 
love police, when, in fact, as the Re-
publicans argue, they just want to take 
all their money away—we know better. 
The fact that Vanita Gupta has the en-
dorsement of every major law enforce-
ment organization puts to rest some of 
the charges they have made against 
her. 
I can’t believe what they are saying 
about these two nominees, but I think 
that a majority of the Senate is ulti-
mately going to judge that they are 
ready to serve this country again and 
should, and the Department of Justice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
Utah has graciously yielded back his 
remaining time, so I ask unanimous 
consent that I speak for a brief few 
minutes and then we vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. And then yield back 
the rest of our time after that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate will soon vote on a motion 
to discharge the nomination of Vanita 
Gupta to serve as the next Attorney 
General—Associate Attorney General. 
The daughter of immigrants, she would 
be the first woman of color and the 
first civil rights attorney to serve as 
Attorney General. 
Ms. Gupta is an exceptional nominee 
and an outstanding lawyer. It is con-
founding that her nomination has been 
tied up in the Judiciary Committee, re-
quiring the Senate to take the extra 
procedural steps to move her nomina-
tion forward. But despite Republican 
obstruction, she will be confirmed by 
this Chamber in a few minutes. 
Ms. Gupta’s credentials speak for 
themselves. She most recently served 
as president and CEO of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
and served 4 years at the Justice De-
partment. 
Her first case after law school in-
volved securing the release of several 
African Americans wrongly convicted 
by all-White juries in Texas. 
At a time when so many in our coun-
try call for action against civil injus-
tices and racial violence, how can we 
not install one of the Nation’s top civil 
rights lawyers at the Department of 
Justice? 
Senate 
Republicans, 
rather 
than 
evaluate Ms. Gupta on the merits of 
her accomplishments, have spent the 
last few weeks appealing to outlandish 
accusations that she is an out-of-touch, 
far-left radical. 
The questions she endured during her 
confirmation 
hearing 
were 
utterly 
inane—from accusations that she is 
anti-police to the insinuation that she 
wants to legalize all drugs. A conserv-
ative 
judicial 
organization 
even 
launched a shameful national ad cam-
paign to smear her reputation—her 
nomination. These smear tactics are 
nonsense. 
Gupta commands the respect of civil 
rights advocates and law enforcement 
and has the endorsement from the Na-
tional Fraternal Order of Police, the 
National Sheriffs’ Association, the As-
sociation of Chiefs of Police, and the 
Federal Law Enforcement Officers As-
sociation. There is no mystery to Ms. 
Gupta’s broad support. She is out-
standing at what she does. She knows 
how to listen and work with others, in-
cluding Republican Senators, and is 
deeply knowledgeable in the field. That 
is exactly—exactly—she is exactly the 
kind of person we need at the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
So I look forward to now moving on 
Ms. Gupta’s nomination. 
I yield back the rest of our time.

60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BAY

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the 60th anniver-
sary of the Bay of Pigs operation. 
Today, we commemorate the 60th an-
niversary of the Bay of Pigs operation 
and pay tribute to the brave and coura-
geous members of Brigada de Asalto 
2506, Assault Brigade 2506. On April 17, 
1961, a group of Cuban patriots landed 
at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow Fidel 
Castro’s communist dictatorship. We 
remember the sacrifice made by these 
brave individuals, and their memory 
lives on in the fight that continues 
today. 
There is no doubt that where we see 
instability, chaos, and violence in

Latin America, we also see the finger-
prints of the Castro regime. The Cuban 
people have suffered decades of oppres-
sion under Castro’s regime. So many 
courageous individuals have dedicated 
their lives to the freedom of Cuba, and 
their commitment and sacrifice have 
kept the hope of liberty alive. 
It is time to show Castro that his era 
of influence in Latin America is over. 
The United States must always support 
those fighting for freedom and democ-
racy, and I will never stop fighting to 
bring a new day of freedom to Cuba and 
all of Latin America.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ANNE STORDAHL 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Anne Stordahl of Pondera County for 
her commitment to supporting Mon-
tana small businesses. 
Anne has been a small business 
owner in Conrad, Montana for 15 years. 
When the local candy shop closed in 
her community, Anne decided to help 
boost community morale by taking on 
a new project and business. She opened 
the 2B Sweet Candy shop right next to 
her hair salon, giving her customers a 
chance to grab some candy while wait-
ing for their next haircut. 
Anne enlisted the help of her three 
children to open a new candy store 
that could bring some joy back to their 
community, especially in a time of un-
certainty when many small businesses 
were closing their doors. Her son han-
dled the behind the scenes work of tak-
ing inventory and balancing the books 
while her daughters handled a variety 
of tasks like designing candy bouquets 
and serving customers. 
Anne grew up on a farm and was able 
to use this experience to teach her chil-
dren what a strong Montana work ethic 
looks like and the importance of fam-
ily operations to our communities. At 
the beginning, she hoped the store 
would bring her family closer, and 
looking back, she would say this was a 
sweet success. 
It is my honor to recognize Anne and 
her children for taking the initiative to 
successfully 
launch 
the 
2B 
Sweet 
Candy Shop. It is now a proud part of 
the Conrad community.∑

REMEMBERING JIM PUTEK 
∑
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Jan-
uary 25, 2021, America lost a great pa-
triot CPT James ‘‘Jim’’ Ronald Putek, 
75, of Alpharetta, GA. Born in Chicago, 
IL, Jim was a decorated Army veteran 
having served in the Vietnam war, 
where 
he 
received 
the 
following 
awards: the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Bronze Star with one 
oakleaf Cluster, the Air Medal, the 
Vietnam Service Medal with one Silver 
and one Bronze Service Star, the Army 
Aviator Badge, and the Republic of 
Vietnam Campaign Medal. 
Captain Putek’s heroism will live 
forever. Following his retirement from 
the Army, Jim continued his passion 
for aviation as a commercial airline 
pilot for Piedmont Airlines and US Air-
ways. 
Captain Putek is survived by his wife 
Tricia Putek, his sister Delores, his sis-
ter-in-law Mary, and his nieces and 
nephews Hank, Gwen, Joanne, Janet, 
and Jon. He was preceded in death by 
his parents Walter and Frances, and his 
brother Henry. 
Jim Putek was a fine gentleman and 
a true hero, respected and revered by 
everyone who met him. When Captain 
Putek passed, we not only lost a good 
man, we lost a great American.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DOMINIC LAJOIE 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor Dominic LaJoie of Van Buren, 
ME, who was recently named as Na-
tional Potato Council, NPC, president 
for 2021. The National Potato Council 
is a grower-led organization managed 
by an Executive Committee and Board 
of Directors, which oversees its oper-
ations and provides guidance on its pol-
icy activities. It does not surprise me 
that Dominic LaJoie was chosen as the 
2021 president to lead the council’s Ex-
ecutive Committee because Dominic 
epitomizes the qualities that are need-
ed to bring State potato grower organi-
zations together at the national level. 
He has a proven history of promoting 
collaboration and respectful, healthy 
debate to further best practices and in-
novation 
in 
agriculture 
for 
years. 
Dominic has also served on the Maine 
Potato Board and has been a long 
standing and active participant of the 
National Potato Council in previous 
years including serving on the Trade 
Committee and as first vice president 
and vice president of the Environ-
mental Affairs Committee. 
But those are the only the highlights 
of 
one 
well-deserved 
appointment. 
What truly makes Dominic stand out is 
his heart for farming, for his family 
and for his community all while step-
ping up to serve in a national seat. 
Dominic and his family are fourth gen-
eration potato farmers. He is so hum-
ble and proud to work with his brother 
and nephew, along with the support of 
their wives and children, on the land 
that was farmed by their parents and 
their 
grandparents 
before 
them. 
Dominic’s work ethic and character 
have shone through throughout his ca-
reer as a farmer, but never one to just 
sit idle, their farm diversified and 
added grain and root vegetables, and 
they have worked to carve out new 
niche products in the natural snacks 
and health food markets. He is active 
in many civic activities and in his 
church, and when given a chance to 
speak of his wife and four children, his 
already genuine and wide smile broad-
ens even further with an acknowledg-
ment of his blessings. 
I was pleased to tour their farm in 
Van Buren a couple of years ago and 
learned directly about their farm: the 
innovations and value added products; 
their focus on precision farming and ef-
ficiencies to enhance the productivity 
of their legacy farm and stewardship of 
the land they grew up on. Upon one of 
Dominic’s awards received in recent 
years, he was asked if he had advice to 
those who are considering taking up 
farming, and he replied ‘‘Never give up, 
be open-minded and embrace change, 
take chances.’’ It was immediately 
clear to me that Dominic’s successes 
through attention to detail, sound 
business practices, and a true commit-
ment to the future of agriculture was 
what brought him to be nominated and 
appointed as president of the National 
Potato Council for 2021. 
I would like to recognize and thank 
Dominic for his ongoing commitment 
to upholding the legacy of potato grow-
ers in our State and this country. I 
cannot speak highly enough of Dominic 
and look forward to his service as the 
president of the National Potato Coun-
cil Executive Committee.∑

RECOGNIZING HUNTER’S BAR-B-Q 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I will recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize a family-owned 
small business and southern Kentucky 
staple, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q of Albany, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
On Hunter Shearer’s 13th birthday, 
when other boys wanted skateboards or 
baseball gloves, Shearer asked for a 
new Weber gas grill. From that point 
on, he was cooking for family and 
friends every chance he could. As a 
welder, Shearer built his own mobile 
grill and smoker, which he used to 
cook at family and church events. He 
first sold barbeque to the public in 2009, 
at the 127 Yard Sale. Seeing a business 
opportunity, Shearer decided to pursue 
his boyhood dream of owning a res-
taurant. In 2012, Hunter began working 
with his father-in-law Mike Duvall to 
convert an old service station into a 
restaurant. 
Sixteen 
months 
later, 
Hunter’s Bar-B-Q welcomed its first 
customers in 2014. 
In 2021, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q continues 
to serve up some of the best BBQ in 
southern Kentucky, and folks drive 
from all over the State to enjoy their 
signature hickory smoked meat and 
family-friendly hospitality. Hunter’s 
care and attention to detail are evident 
in every aspect of his restaurant and 
catering business. At the restaurant, 
everything is made from scratch, from 
handmade picnic tables and cooking 
equipment to the smoke shack, pits, 
and charcoal makers. Even the char-
coal is made on site, using hickory 
wood from local sawmills. 
Locally, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q is known 
as ‘‘the place with the big flag.’’ It

boasts a 25 by 40-foot American flag 
atop a 100-foot flagpole almost as big as 
the store. Thanks to the smokers and 
pits, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q can feed around 
3,000 people a day. The pulled pork and 
sliced shoulder are favorites, attract-
ing customers from all over the coun-
try. Catering is also a large part of the 
business, with Hunter’s Bar-B-Q cater-
ing events as far away as Louisville. 
Together with his wife, Shannon, 
Hunter seeks to give back to their 
community in any way possible. Lo-
cally, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q sponsors Little 
League and high school sports teams. 
They regularly support community or-
ganizations, 
including 
sponsoring 
Project Graduation, the All for Benny 
Fundraiser, and the American Cancer 
Society’s Relay for Life. Additionally, 
Hunter’s Bar-B-Q has supported numer-
ous 
fundraisers 
that have covered 
emergency and medical expenses for 
local members of the community. 
Hunter’s Bar-B-Q is a proud member of 
the Albany/Clinton County Chamber of 
Commerce. Notably, Hunter’s Bar-B-Q 
is one of two caterers designated by the 
Lake Cumberland District Health De-
partment to provide food for events in 
Clinton County, Kentucky. 
Hunter’s Bar-B-Q is a remarkable ex-
ample of how hard work, ingenuity, 
and discipline can turn a childhood 
dream into reality. Small businesses 
like Hunter’s Bar-B-Q form the heart of 
communities across Kentucky, regu-
larly stepping up to support their com-
munities. Congratulations to Hunter, 
Shannon, and the entire team at Hunt-
er’s Bar-B-Q. I wish them the best of 
luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself 
and Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 1133. A bill to direct the Director 
of the National Institutes of Health, in 
consultation with the Director of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute, to establish a program to support 
or conduct research on valvular heart 
disease, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on an entirely different matter, 
colleagues in Congress and my fellow 
Kentuckians were heartbroken last 
June when our dear friend, Carol 
Leavell Barr, suddenly and unexpect-
edly passed away. 
She left behind two beautiful young 
daughters and an adoring husband in 
Congressman ANDY BARR. She was only 
39 years old. Since then, we have 
learned her fatal heart attack was like-
ly the result of an underlying condition 
called mitral valve prolapse. 
Carol was diagnosed at a young age. 
Like millions of Americans with heart 
valve defects, she lived for many years 
with no apparent symptoms. Trag-
ically, it only took an instant for her 
condition to turn deadly. Approxi-
mately 25,000 Americans each year lose 
their lives from this heart valve dis-
ease. Her passing deprived the Barr 
family of an extraordinary wife and 
mother. We all lost a warm and uplift-
ing friend. 
One of the most troubling aspects of 
this syndrome is just how much we 
still don’t know. So Congressman BARR 
is taking action. He introduced the 
Cardiovascular Advances in Research 
and Opportunities Legacy Act, the 
CAROL Act. It would encourage new 
research into valvular heart disease, 
help us better understand the risks, 
and bring together top experts to iden-
tify potential treatments. 
With this legislation, we can help 
prevent more families from enduring 
this tragedy. More than 120 House col-
leagues have already cosponsored the 
CAROL Act. It has also earned the sup-
port of major health advocacy groups. 
So today, I am proud to introduce 
the CAROL Act here in the Senate. I 
am grateful to partner with Senator 
SINEMA, one of Congressman BARR’s 
friends from their days serving to-
gether in the House. This important 
legislation is a fitting tribute to a won-
derful Kentuckian. It embodies Carol’s 
lifetime of service to others, and I look 
forward to its passage. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD.

By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. WARNER): 
S. 1155. A bill to reform Federal 
firearmslaws, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, it is pain-
fully clear that existing Federal poli-
cies do not provide a comprehensive 
approach to address the national epi-
demic of gun violence. In fact, in 2019, 
for the third consecutive year, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
reported gun violence as a leading 
cause of premature death in the United 
States resulting in the loss of 39,707 
American lives—that is 109 American 
lives lost each day. And unfortunately, 
2020 was no different. Even as the 
Country was enduring an unprece-
dented global pandemic, communities 
across the country were left dealing 
with the ever-present threat of gun vio-
lence. 
There is single legislative action that 
can eradicate the complex and deeply 
rooted issues of gun violence. However, 
we must undertake the correct ap-
proach by focusing on many issues, in-
cluding improvements to our mental 
health system, better security proto-
cols, and commonsense rules about gun 
use and safety, such that keep firearms 
out of the hands of dangerous individ-
uals. 
Virginians know all too well the 
heartbreaking consequences of gun vio-
lence. We have seen it in the tragedies 
of Virginia Tech and Virginia Beach 
and the countless drive-by shootings, 
domestic violence, and suicides by fire-
arms. Yet the Commonwealth has cho-
sen to acknowledge and address its un-
fortunate history of gun violence, and 
this past year adopted a series of gun 
violence prevention measures. These 
measures include legislation to enact 
an Extreme Risk Protective Order; an 
expansion of background checks on all 
gun sales; a mandate to report lost and 
stolen firearms; safeguards that pre-
vent children from accessing firearms; 
and a reinstatement of Virginia’s suc-
cessful one-handgun-a-month policy. 
The Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Vio-
lence Act of 2021 builds on the newly 
adopted Virginia framework by cre-
ating a comprehensive package of poli-
cies at the federal level to reduce gun 
violence across the nation. 
With public support for commonsense 
rules at the highest it has ever been, 
we cannot wait until the next senseless 
tragedy before enacting commonsense 
gun policies. It is important to remem-
ber that gun violence is preventable 
and requires we take an evidence-based 
approach to create a more peaceful so-
ciety, free of gun violence. I believe 
that the ‘‘Virginia Plan’’ will pave the 
way to advance meaningful gun reform 
and ultimately save lives. 
Now is the time to act. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Ms. HASSAN): 
S. 1161. A bill to promote focused re-
search and innovation in quantum 
communications and quantum network 
infrastructure to bolster internet secu-
rity, and for other purposes; to the

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 1179. A bill to provide financial as-
sistance for projects to address certain 
subsidence impacts in the State of 
California, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Canal Con-
veyance Capacity Restoration Act,’’ 
which I introduced today. Representa-
tives JIM COSTA (D–CA) has introduced 
companion legislation in the House. 
The bill has two major provisions, 
benefiting both drought resilience and 
the environment: 
First, it would authorize more than 
$653 million to restore the capacity of 
three canals of national importance. 
Restoring these canals would improve 
California’s drought resilience and help 
the nation’s leading agricultural econ-
omy comply with limits on ground-
water pumping under the state’s Sus-
tainable 
Groundwater 
Management 
Act. 
Second, the bill authorizes an addi-
tional $180 million to restore salmon 
runs on the San Joaquin River. The 
funding is for fish passage structures, 
levees and other improvements that 
will allow the threatened Central Val-
ley Spring-run Chinook salmon to 
swim freely upstream from the ocean 
to the Friant Dam. 
The bill authorizes a 1⁄3 Federal cost- 
share for restoring the capacity of the 
Friant-Kern Canal, the Delta-Mendota 
Canal, and the California Aqueduct. 
Coordinated legislation in the State 
legislature introduced by State Sen-
ator Melissa Hurtado would authorize a 
1⁄3 state cost-share for restoring the ca-
nals’ capacity. Under the coordinated 
Federal and State legislation, the 
locals would also be responsible for a 1⁄3 
cost-share for the canal restoration 
projects. 
This legislation would help Cali-
fornia water users and California’s na-
tion-leading agricultural industry com-
ply with a recent State requirement to 
end the overpumping of groundwater. 
The stakes are huge: bringing ground-
water into balance will reduce the 
water supply of the San Joaquin Valley 
by about 2 million acre-feet per year. 
Unless local water agencies and the 
State and Federal governments take 
action, a recent U.C. Berkeley study 
has projected severe impacts from 
these water supply losses: 
798,000 acres of land would have to be 
retired from agricultural production, 
nearly 1⁄6 of the working farmland in an 
area that produces half the fruit and 
vegetables grown in the nation; and 
$5.9 billion would be lost in annual 
farm income in a region that is almost 
entirely reliant on agriculture and has 
been called ‘‘the Appalachia of the 
West’’ due to its severe economic dis-
advantage. 
One of the most cost-effective and ef-
ficient ways to restore groundwater 
balance is to convey floodwaters to 
farmlands where they can recharge the 
aquifer. California has the most vari-
able precipitation of any State. When 
we get massive storms from atmos-
pheric rivers, there is plenty of runoff 
to recharge aquifers—but only if we 
can effectively convey the floodwaters 
throughout the San Joaquin Valley to 
recharge areas. 
Here is where the challenge arises. 
For a variety of reasons, the ground be-
neath the major canals has dropped by 
as much as 10 to 20 feet, which has 
caused canals designed to convey flood-
waters to buckle and drop in many 
places. Other parts of the canals have 
not subsided, so the amount of water 
that the canal conveys must be reduced 
so that the canals don’t overrun. 
As a result, these essential canals for 
conveying floodwaters have lost as 
much as 60% of their conveyance ca-
pacity. The bill I am introducing today 
would provide Federal assistance to 
help fix these Federal canals. 
Specifically, the bill would authorize 
$653.4 million in a Federal funding-cost 
share for three major projects to repair 
Federal canals damaged by subsidence 
to achieve their lost capacity: 
$180 million for the Friant-Kern 
Canal, which would move an additional 
100,000 acre-feet per year on average; 
$183.9 million for the Delta Mendota 
Canal, which would move an additional 
62,000 acre-feet per year on average; 
and 
$289.5 million for California Aqueduct 
repairs, which would move an addi-
tional 205,000 acre-feet per year on av-
erage. While parts of the California Aq-
ueduct are state-owned, the majority 
of the repairs are on its federally- 
owned portion. 
If the Federal government covers a 
portion of the cost of restoring these 
three essential Federal canals for con-
veying floodwaters, it will give local 
farmers a fighting chance to bring 
their groundwater basins into balance 
without being forced to retire massive 
amounts of land. 
Critically, the ability to deliver 
floodwaters through restored Federal 
canals will allow the water districts to 
invest in their own turnouts, pumps, 
detention basins and other ground-
water recharge projects. The South 
Valley Water Association, which covers 
just a small part of the Valley, pro-
vided my office with a list of 36 such 
projects for its area alone. 
The Public Policy Institute of Cali-
fornia (PPIC) has determined that 
groundwater recharge projects are the 
best option to help the San Joaquin 
Valley comply with the new state 
groundwater 
pumping 
law. 
PPIC 
projects that the Valley can make up 
300,000 to 500,000 acre feet of its ground-
water 
deficit 
through 
recharge 
projects. 
A study commissioned by the coali-
tion group called the ‘‘Water Blueprint 
for the San Joaquin Valley’’ estimates 
that required reductions in ground-
water could cause a loss of up to 42,000 
farm and agricultural jobs in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Another 40,000 jobs or 
more could be lost statewide each year 
due to reductions in Valley agricul-
tural production, putting the total at 
approximately 85,000 jobs statewide. 
Most of these impacts will fall dis-
proportionately on economically dis-
advantaged communities. These im-
pacts will be significant unless we ad-
dress them through collaborative plan-
ning, policies, infrastructure, recharge 
and necessary financial support. 
Let me now turn to the three critical 
canals that the bill would authorize as-
sistance to restore. The Friant-Kern 
Canal is a key feature of the Friant Di-
vision of the Federal Central Valley 
Project on the Eastside of the San Joa-
quin Valley. For nearly 70 years, the 
Friant 
Division 
successfully 
kept 
groundwater 
tables 
stable

Eastside. This provided a sustainable 
source of water for farms and for thou-
sands of Californians and more than 50 
small, rural, or disadvantaged commu-
nities who rely entirely on ground-
water for their household water sup-
plies. 
But 
unsustainable 
groundwater 
pumping in the Valley has reduced the 
Friant-Kern Canal’s ability to deliver 
water to all who need it. Land ele-
vation subsidence caused by over- 
pumping means that not all of the sup-
plies stored at Friant Dam can be con-
veyed through the canal. In some 
areas, the canal can carry only 40 per-
cent of what it’s designed to deliver. 
In 2017, a very wet year in which we 
should have been banking as much 
flood water as possible, the Friant- 
Kern Canal couldn’t deliver an addi-
tional 300,000 acre-feet of water that it 
would have been able to convey had its 
capacity not been limited by subsid-
ence. This significant amount of water 
would have been destined for ground-
water recharge efforts in the south San 
Joaquin Valley, where the impacts of 
reduced water deliveries, water quality 
issues and groundwater regulation are 
expected to be most severe. 
The California Aqueduct serves more 
than 27 million people in Southern 
California and the Silicon Valley and 
more than 750,000 acres of the Nation’s 
most productive farmland. But despite 
its name, much of the California Aque-
duct is owned by the Federal govern-
ment and serves portions of Silicon 
Valley, small towns and communities 
in the northern San Joaquin Valley, 
and 
farms 
from 
Firebaugh 
to 
Kettleman City. The aqueduct rep-
resents a successful 70–year partner-
ship between the Federal Government 
and the State of California. 
In recent years, particularly recent 
drought years, the California Aqueduct 
has subsided. It has lost as much as 
20% of its capacity to move water to 
California’s families, farms and busi-
nesses. California is leading efforts to 
repair the aqueduct and is working to 
provide its share of funding, but the 
Federal government will also need to 
pay its fair share. The bill I am intro-
ducing today would authorize $289.5 
million toward restoring the California 
Aqueduct. 
The Delta-Mendota Canal stretches 
southward 117 miles from the C.W. Bill 
Jones Pumping Plant along the west-
ern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, 
parallel to the California Aqueduct. 
The Delta-Mendota Canal has lost 15% 
of its conveyance capacity due to sub-
sidence. The bill I am introducing 
today would authorize $183.9 million 
toward restoring its full ability to con-
vey floodwaters to farms needing to re-
charge their groundwater, and to wild-
life refuges of critical importance for 
migratory waterfowl along the Pacific 
Flyway. 
This bill responds to a potential cri-
sis that very possibly could cause the 
forced retirement of nearly 1/6 of the 
working farmland in an area that pro-
duces half of America’s fruits and vege-
tables. 
These are Federal canals, and the 
federal government must help give 
these farmers and communities reliant 
on the agricultural economy a fighting 
chance to keep their lands in produc-
tion. 
In addition, this legislation helps to 
restore an historic salmon run on Cali-
fornia’s second-longest river, the San 
Joaquin. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor.

BLUMENTHAL, Ms. DUCKWORTH, 
Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. BROWN):

United States from the North Atlantic 
Treaty and authorizing related litiga-
tion, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, through-
out his time in office, President Donald 
Trump 
repeatedly 
disparaged 
our 
NATO allies and reportedly threatened 
withdrawal from the NATO alliance, 
the bedrock of European and American 
security for over seventy years. Al-
though our current President has re-
committed the United States to NATO 
and our transatlantic partnerships, it 
is still necessary for the Senate to con-
sider legislation that prevents any 
President from withdrawing the United 
States from this critical defense trea-
ty. This legislation would not only help 
address present national security chal-
lenges by reaffirming the U.S. commit-
ment to Europe, it would also provide 
clarity to important constitutional 
questions regarding the role of Con-
gress in terminating U.S. participation 
in treaties and alliances. Particularly 
with a treaty obligation that is as cen-
tral to U.S. security as NATO, no 
President should be allowed to unilat-
erally withdraw without the advice and 
consent of the Senate. 
Over the past several years, NATO al-
lies, many of whom we have fought 
alongside since World War II and ear-
lier in some cases, have questioned our 
allegiance for the first time in the his-
tory of NATO. In response to the only 
invocation of Article 5 of the NATO 
Treaty following the 9/11 attacks, more 
than 1,000 servicemembers from these 
allied nations gave their lives fighting 
alongside the United States. While the 
United States must continue to press 
every 
country 
to 
increase 
defense 
spending to meet the agreed-upon goal 
of 2 percent of GDP by 2024, and ensure 
that our European allies contribute to 
their own defense, U.S. withdrawal 
from NATO should not be considered 
without Congressional input. For this 
reason, we must use our constitutional 
powers of advice and consent and of the 
purse to block any unilateral executive 
withdrawal, and preemptively author-
ize legal proceedings to challenge any 
decision to terminate U.S. member-
ship. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today with Senators RUBIO, COLLINS, 
BLUMENTHAL, COONS, DUCKWORTH, DUR-
BIN, FEINSTEIN, GRAHAM, KING, KLO-
BUCHAR, MERKLEY, MORAN, SHAHEEN, 
and WARNER would provide the nec-
essary tools to prevent a President 
from 
unilaterally 
withdrawing 
the 
United States from the NATO treaty 
without the consent of Congress. The 
Senate has repeatedly indicated its 
support for NATO through previous 
legislation, including the original vote 
of 82–13 in 1949 to grant the Senate’s 
consent to join NATO, and the Fiscal 
Year 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, which called for the United 
States to ‘‘remain ironclad in its com-
mitment to uphold its obligations 
under the North Atlantic Treaty.’’ 
I am proud to have bipartisan sup-
port for this bill to ensure that the 
safety of the American people is 
prioritized 
through 
our 
continued 
membership in NATO, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to 
ensure that this legislation is swiftly 
considered by the Senate. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

ORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
HIRING 
ROBERT 
MONT-
GOMERY 
‘‘BOBBY’’ 
KNIGHT 
AS 
THE HEAD COACH OF THE MEN’S 
BASKETBALL TEAM AT INDIANA 
UNIVERSITY 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself and Mr. 
YOUNG) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 157 
Whereas Coach Bobby Knight had a leg-
endary career as a college basketball head 
coach for more than 40 years, 29 of which 
were with Indiana University, starting on 
March 27, 1971; 
Whereas the success of Coach Knight has 
led to his induction into the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘NCAA’’) Hall of Fame 
and the Indiana University Hoosier Basket-
ball Hall of Fame; 
Whereas Coach Knight— 
(1) earned an NCAA National Champion-
ship as a player at The Ohio State Univer-
sity in 1960; 
(2) won 3 NCAA National Championships as 
the Head Coach of the men’s basketball team 
at Indiana University in 1976, 1981, and 1987; 
and 
(3) won a National Invitational Tour-
nament championship as the Head Coach of 
the men’s basketball team at Indiana Uni-
versity in 1979; 
Whereas, during his 29 years at Indiana 
University, Coach Knight— 
(1) coached 11 Big Ten Conference Cham-
pionship teams; 
(2) took 24 teams to the NCAA tournament; 
and 
(3) earned 8 Big Ten Coach of the Year 
awards and 4 national coach of the year 
awards; 
Whereas the 1975–76 men’s basketball team 
at Indiana University, which was coached by 
Coach Knight, is the last team to complete 
the entire regular season and NCAA tour-
nament without a single loss; 
Whereas Coach Knight coached the United 
States men’s national basketball team to a 
gold medal in the 1979 Pan American Games 
and to a gold medal in the 1984 Olympic 
Games; 
Whereas Coach Knight had an 80 percent 
graduation rate for his players, with an as-
tounding 98 percent graduation rate for all 
players who he coached for at least 4 years, 
more than twice the average graduation 
rates for other Division I schools; 
Whereas, even after 40 years as a head 
coach, none of the teams coached by Coach 
Knight were ever cited for a recruiting or 
academic violation while competing at the 
highest levels of the sport; 
Whereas Coach Knight attained 902 wins 
during his overall head coaching career at 
the United States Military Academy, Indi-
ana University, and Texas Tech University, 
by perfecting— 
(1) the motion offense, which emphasized 
discipline, teamwork, selflessness, and pe-
rimeter passing to control the game and in-
crease the percentage of successful shots; 
and 
(2) smothering man-to-man defense; 
Whereas Coach Knight had a reputation as 
a passionate player and coach, a man who 
never accepted defeat, who pushed himself 
and his teams to achieve, and created a per-
sona in line with the great Vince Lombardi 
and Woody Hayes; 
Whereas Coach Knight never focused his 
coaching on winning a game, but on the ef-
fort it took to become a champion, saying 
‘‘The will to succeed is important, but 
what’s more important is the will to pre-
pare’’; and 
Whereas Coach Knight earned the NCAA 
Naismith Award for Men’s Outstanding Con-
tribution to Basketball in 2007: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) Coach Robert Montgomery ‘‘Bobby’’ 
Knight set the standard for excellence as a 
collegiate men’s basketball coach at Indiana 
University; 
(2) the success of Coach Knight was in turn 
the success of the entire Indiana University 
system and a source of continuing pride for 
the entire State of Indiana; 
(3) we honor the drive, determination, and 
character of Coach Knight and all that 
Coach Knight did in educating and men-
toring hundreds of Indiana University play-
ers over 3 decades; 
(4) few can ever achieve greatness, but 
Coach Knight has propelled young men to 
touch greatness for at least a moment, giv-
ing them experiences and lessons that have 
shaped their entire lives; and 
(5) for all the memories, Coach Knight, we 
give you a heartfelt thank you.

Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr.

tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs: 
S. RES. 158 
Whereas public safety telecommunications 
professionals play a critical role in emer-
gency response; 
Whereas the work that public safety tele-
communications professionals perform goes 
far beyond simply relaying information be-
tween the public and first responders; 
Whereas, when responding to reports of 
missing, abducted, and sexually exploited 
children, the information obtained and ac-
tions taken by public safety telecommuni-
cations professionals form the foundation for 
an effective response; 
Whereas, when a hostage taker or suicidal 
individual calls 911, the first contact that in-
dividual has is with a public safety tele-
communications professional, whose nego-
tiation skills can prevent the situation from 
worsening; 
Whereas, during crises, public safety tele-
communications professionals, while col-
lecting vital information to provide situa-
tional awareness for responding officers— 
(1) coach callers through first aid tech-
niques; and 
(2) give advice to those callers to prevent 
further harm;

serve as public safety telecommunications 
professionals has an extreme emotional and

compounded by long hours and the around-

Whereas public safety telecommunications 
professionals should be recognized by all lev-
els of government for the lifesaving and pro-

Whereas major emergencies, including nat-
ural disasters and the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, highlight the 
dedication of public safety telecommuni-
cations professionals and their important 
work in protecting the public and police,

Whereas visits and visitors to the national

sible for $21,000,000,000 in spending in 2019; 
Whereas the dedicated employees of the 
National Park Service carry out their mis-
sion to protect the units of the national

Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 162 
Whereas assistive technology is any item, 
piece of equipment, or product system that 
is used to increase, maintain, or improve the 
functional capabilities of individuals with 
disabilities and older adults; 
Whereas the term ‘‘assistive technology 
service’’ means any service that directly as-
sists an individual with a disability or an 
older adult in the selection, acquisition, or 
use of an assistive technology device; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reported that 1 in 4 
individuals in the United States, or almost 
61,000,000 individuals, has a disability; 
Whereas, in 2019, the Department of Edu-
cation reported that there were more than 
7,100,000 children with disabilities; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reported that, among adults 
65 years of age and older, 2 in 5 have a dis-
ability; 
Whereas assistive technology allows indi-
viduals with disabilities and older adults to 
be included in their communities and in in-
clusive classrooms and workplaces; 
Whereas assistive technology devices and 
services are necessities, not luxury items, for 
millions of individuals with disabilities and 
older adults, without which they would be 
unable to live in their communities, access 
education, or obtain, retain, and advance 
gainful, 
competitive, 
integrated 
employ-
ment; 
Whereas the availability of assistive tech-
nology in the workplace promotes economic 
self-sufficiency, enhances work participa-
tion, and is critical to the employment of in-
dividuals with disabilities and older adults; 
and 
Whereas State assistive technology pro-
grams support a continuum of services that 
include— 
(1) the exchange, repair, recycling, and 
other reutilization of assistive technology 
devices; 
(2) device loan programs that provide 
short-term loans of assistive technology de-
vices to individuals, employers, public agen-
cies, and others; 
(3) the demonstration of devices to inform 
decision making; and 
(4) State financing to help individuals pur-
chase or obtain assistive technology through 
a variety of initiatives, such as financial 
loan programs, leasing programs, and other 
financing alternatives, that give individuals 
affordable, flexible options to purchase or 
obtain assistive technology: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 14, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Assistive Technology Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) commends— 
(A) assistive technology specialists and 
program coordinators for their hard work 
and dedication to serving individuals with 
disabilities who are in need of finding the 
proper assistive technology to meet their in-
dividual needs; and 
(B) professional organizations and re-
searchers dedicated to facilitating the access 
and acquisition of assistive technology for 
individuals with disabilities and older adults

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Following the spread of COVID–19 in 
2020, there has been a dramatic increase in 
hate crimes and violence against Asian- 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
(2) According to a recent report, there were 
nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian dis-
crimination and incidents related to COVID– 
19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 
2021, in all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia. 
(3) During this timeframe, race has been 
cited as the primary reason for discrimina-
tion, making up over 90 percent of incidents, 
and the United States condemns and de-
nounces any and all anti-Asian and Pacific 
Islander sentiment in any form. 
(4) Roughly 36 percent of Asian-American 
and Pacific Islander businesses have been the 
targets of discrimination incidents during 
this time period. 
(5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander older adults, particularly 
those older adults who are recent immi-
grants or have limited English proficiency, 
may face even greater challenges in dealing 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, including dis-
crimination, economic insecurity, and lan-
guage isolation.

lowing:

On page 2, beginning on line 9, strike

crimes (as described in section 249 of title 18, 
United States Code)’’. 
On page 2, line 11, strike ‘‘or local’’ and in-
sert ‘‘local, or Tribal’’. 
Beginning on page 2, strike line 12 and all 
that follows through page 3, line 8 and insert 
the following: 
(b) APPLICABLE PERIOD DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means 
the period beginning on the date on which 
the officer or employee is designated under

REAFFIRMING 
THE 
STRATEGIC 
PARTNERSHIP 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND MONGOLIA 
AND RECOGNIZING THE 30TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF DEMOCRACY IN 
MONGOLIA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 23, S. Res. 36. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 36) reaffirming the 
strategic partnership between the United 
States and Mongolia and recognizing the 
30th anniversary of democracy in Mongolia. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and an amendment to 
strike the preamble and insert the part 
printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas the United States and Mongolia es-
tablished diplomatic relations in January 1987, 
and since that time the relationship has grown 
stronger based on shared strategic interests, se-
curity cooperation, democratic values, good gov-
ernance, and respect for human rights; 
Whereas, since its peaceful democratic revolu-
tion in 1989, through a series of initiatives, 
Mongolia has charted a successful path to 
multiparty democracy and a free market econ-
omy; 
Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mongolia 
declared an end to a one-party and authori-
tarian political system and adopted democratic 
and free market reforms; 
Whereas, in 1992, Mongolia adopted a con-
stitution establishing a democracy, becoming the 
first country in Asia to transition from com-
munism to democracy; 
Whereas Mongolia has shown its commitment 
to a ‘‘third neighbor’’ relationship with the 
United States by sending troops to support 
United States operations in Iraq from 2003 
through 2008 and Afghanistan since 2009, and in 
addition has a strong record of troop contribu-
tions to international peacekeeping missions; 
Whereas successive Mongolian governments 
have taken notable steps to strengthen civil soci-
ety, battle corruption, and spur economic devel-
opment; 
Whereas the Parliament of Mongolia, the 
State Great Khural, has engaged with Congress, 
including through the House Democracy Part-
nership, thereby promoting responsive and effec-
tive governance through peer-to-peer coopera-
tion; 
Whereas Mongolia began as a partner to the 
Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE) in 2004, graduated to become a 
participating state in 2012, and participates ac-
tively in the OSCE’s work promoting stability, 
peace, and democracy; 
Whereas Mongolia has regularly invited the 
OSCE and other organizations to send moni-
toring teams for its presidential and parliamen-
tary elections; 
Whereas Mongolia has also been an active 
member of the Community of Democracies 
(CoD), a global coalition of states that support 
adherence to common democratic values and 
standards, and Mongolia has not only remained 
active since the founding of the CoD in 2000, but 
successfully chaired the CoD from 2011 through 
2013; 
Whereas, in addition to supporting the OSCE 
and the CoD, Mongolia supports democratic ini-
tiatives while participating in a wide range of 
other global institutions; 
Whereas, most recently, on June 24, 2020, 
Mongolia successfully organized parliamentary 
elections, strengthening its commitment to de-
mocracy and the rule of law; 
Whereas the success of Mongolia as a democ-
racy and its strategic location, sovereignty, ter-
ritorial integrity, and ability to pursue an inde-
pendent foreign policy are important to the na-
tional security of the United States; 
Whereas the United States has provided sup-
port to Mongolia through the Millennium Chal-
lenge Corporation via an initial 2007 compact 
designed to increase economic growth and re-
duce poverty, as well as a second compact 
signed in 2018 involving investments in water in-
frastructure, including supply and wastewater 
recycling, as well as water sector sustainability; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United 
States and Mongolia released a joint statement 
and the ‘‘Roadmap for Expanded Economic 
Partnership between the United States and 
Mongolia,’’ outlining the intent to deepen the 
bilateral 
commercial 
relationship, 
including 
through full implementation of the obligations 
under the Agreement on Transparency in Mat-
ters Related to International Trade and Invest-
ment between the United States of America and 
Mongolia, signed at New York September 24, 
2013 (in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘United 
States-Mongolia 
Transparency 
Agreement’’), 
and collaboration in supporting Mongolian 
small- and medium-sized enterprises through 
various programs and projects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Cen-
sus, trade between the United States and Mon-
golia is modest but growing, with total trade in 
2019 between the two countries of approximately 
$217,400,000 in goods, including $192,800,000 in 
United 
States 
exports 
to 
Mongolia 
and 
$24,600,000 in United States imports from Mon-
golia; 
Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country 
under the Generalized System of Preferences 
program, but its use of the program remains low, 
as, in 2018, only $3,200,000 of exports from Mon-
golia to the United States were under the pro-
gram; and 
Whereas, on July 31, 2019, the United States 
and Mongolia declared the bilateral relationship 
a Strategic Partnership and noted the shared 
desire— 
(1) to intensify cooperation as strong democ-
racies based on the rule of law through safe-
guarding and promoting democratic values and 
human rights, including the freedoms of religion 
or belief, expression, including internet and 
media freedom, assembly, and association, as 
well as anticorruption and fiscal transparency, 
and youth and emerging leader development; 
(2) to cooperate in promoting national security 
and stability across the Indo-Pacific region so 
that all countries, secure in their sovereignty, 
are able to pursue economic growth consistent 
with international law and principles of fair 
competition; 
(3) to deepen national security and law-en-
forcement ties through collaboration on bilateral 
and multilateral security, judicial, and law-en-
forcement efforts in the region; 
(4) to strengthen cooperation in multilateral 
engagements such as peacekeeping, humani-
tarian assistance, and disaster preparedness 
and relief operations; 
(5) to expand trade and investment relations 
on a fair and reciprocal basis, support private 
sector-led growth, fully implement the United 
States-Mongolia Transparency Agreement, pro-
mote women’s entrepreneurship, and continue 
to explore support for infrastructure under the 
new United States International Development 
Finance Corporation with the new tools pro-
vided under the BUILD Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 
9601 et seq.); 
(6) to strengthen border security, prevent ille-
gal transshipment and trafficking, expand co-
operation on civil aviation safety and oversight, 
and efficiently facilitate legitimate travel be-
tween Mongolia and the United States; 
(7) to increase cooperation in addressing 
transnational threats such as terrorism, human 
trafficking, drug trafficking, the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, cyberattacks, 
transnational organized crime, pandemics, and 
other emerging nontraditional security threats; 
(8) to continue to develop an environment in 
which civil society, social media, and a free and 
independent media can flourish; and 
(9) to maintain high-level official dialogues, 
encourage bilateral exchanges at all levels of 
government, and further develop people-to-peo-
ple exchanges to deepen engagement on issues of 
mutual interest and concern: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of the relation-
ship between the United States and Mongolia 
and remains committed to advancing this Stra-
tegic Partnership in the future; 
(2) emphasizes the importance of free and fair 
elections in Mongolia; 
(3) applauds the continued engagement of 
Mongolia in the Organization for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, the Community of De-
mocracies, congressional-parliamentary partner-
ships, including continued high-level parliamen-
tary exchange, and other institutions that pro-
mote democratic values, which reinforces the 
commitment of the people and the Government 
of Mongolia to those values and standards; 
(4) encourages the United States Government 
to help Mongolia use its benefits under the Gen-
eralized System of Preferences program and 
other relevant programs to increase trade be-
tween the United States and Mongolia; 
(5) urges the United States International De-
velopment Finance Corporation to expand ac-
tivities in Mongolia to support economic devel-
opment, diversification of the economy, and 
women-owned small- and medium-sized enter-
prises; 
(6) urges private and public support to help 
diversify the economy of Mongolia through in-
creased cooperation and investments, as well as 
infrastructure and other vital projects; 
(7) urges the Department of State, the United 
States Agency for International Development, 
and other relevant agencies to continue to sup-
port Mongolia’s democratic and economic devel-
opment and efforts on anticorruption; 
(8) reaffirms the importance of civil society to 
the continued democratic development of Mon-
golia; 
(9) encourages the Government of Mongolia to 
build a regulatory system that supports and en-
courages the growth and operation of inde-

tary elections, strengthening its commit-
ment to democracy and the rule of law; 
Whereas the success of Mongolia as a de-
mocracy and its strategic location, sov-
ereignty, territorial integrity, and ability to 
pursue an independent foreign policy are im-
portant to the national security of the 
United States; 
Whereas the United States has provided 
support to Mongolia through the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation via an initial 2007 
compact designed to increase economic 
growth and reduce poverty, as well as a sec-
ond compact signed in 2018 involving invest-
ments in water infrastructure, including sup-
ply and wastewater recycling, as well as 
water sector sustainability; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United 
States and Mongolia released a joint state-
ment and the ‘‘Roadmap for Expanded Eco-
nomic 
Partnership 
between 
the 
United 
States and Mongolia,’’ outlining the intent 
to deepen the bilateral commercial relation-
ship, including through full implementation 
of the obligations under the Agreement on 
Transparency in Matters Related to Inter-
national Trade and Investment between the 
United States of America and Mongolia, 
signed at New York September 24, 2013 (in 
this preamble referred to as the ‘‘United 
States-Mongolia Transparency Agreement’’), 
and collaboration in supporting Mongolian 
small- and medium-sized enterprises through 
various programs and projects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the 
Census, trade between the United States and 
Mongolia is modest but growing, with total 
trade in 2019 between the two countries of 
approximately $217,400,000 in goods, includ-
ing $192,800,000 in United States exports to 
Mongolia and $24,600,000 in United States im-
ports from Mongolia; 
Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country 
under the Generalized System of Preferences 
program, but its use of the program remains 
low, as, in 2018, only $3,200,000 of exports 
from Mongolia to the United States were 
under the program; and 
Whereas, on July 31, 2019, the United 
States and Mongolia declared the bilateral 
relationship a Strategic Partnership and 
noted the shared desire— 
(1) to intensify cooperation as strong de-
mocracies based on the rule of law through 
safeguarding and promoting democratic val-
ues and human rights, including the free-
doms of religion or belief, expression, includ-
ing internet and media freedom, assembly, 
and association, as well as anticorruption 
and fiscal transparency, and youth and 
emerging leader development; 
(2) to cooperate in promoting national se-
curity and stability across the Indo-Pacific 
region so that all countries, secure in their 
sovereignty, are able to pursue economic 
growth consistent with international law 
and principles of fair competition; 
(3) to deepen national security and law-en-
forcement ties through collaboration on bi-
lateral and multilateral security, judicial, 
and law-enforcement efforts in the region; 
(4) to strengthen cooperation in multilat-
eral engagements such as peacekeeping, hu-
manitarian assistance, and disaster pre-
paredness and relief operations; 
(5) to expand trade and investment rela-
tions on a fair and reciprocal basis, support 
private sector-led growth, fully implement 
the United States-Mongolia Transparency 
Agreement, promote women’s entrepreneur-
ship, and continue to explore support for in-
frastructure under the new United States 
International Development Finance Corpora-
tion with the new tools provided under the 
BUILD Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.); 
(6) to strengthen border security, prevent 
illegal transshipment and trafficking, ex-
pand cooperation on civil aviation safety and 
oversight, and efficiently facilitate legiti-
mate travel between Mongolia and the 
United States; 
(7) to increase cooperation in addressing 
transnational threats such as terrorism, 
human trafficking, drug trafficking, the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
cyberattacks, transnational organized crime, 
pandemics, and other emerging nontradi-
tional security threats; 
(8) to continue to develop an environment 
in which civil society, social media, and a 
free and independent media can flourish; and 
(9) to maintain high-level official dia-
logues, encourage bilateral exchanges at all 
levels of government, and further develop 
people-to-people exchanges to deepen en-
gagement on issues of mutual interest and 
concern: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of the rela-
tionship between the United States and Mon-
golia and remains committed to advancing 
this Strategic Partnership in the future; 
(2) emphasizes the importance of free and 
fair elections in Mongolia; 
(3) applauds the continued engagement of 
Mongolia in the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation in Europe, the Community 
of Democracies, congressional-parliamentary 
partnerships, including continued high-level 
parliamentary exchange, and other institu-
tions that promote democratic values, which 
reinforces the commitment of the people and 
the Government of Mongolia to those values 
and standards; 
(4) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to help Mongolia use its benefits under 
the Generalized System of Preferences pro-
gram and other relevant programs to in-
crease trade between the United States and 
Mongolia; 
(5) urges the United States International 
Development Finance Corporation to expand 
activities in Mongolia to support economic 
development, diversification of the economy, 
and women-owned small- and medium-sized 
enterprises; 
(6) urges private and public support to help 
diversify the economy of Mongolia through 
increased cooperation and investments, as 
well 
as 
infrastructure 
and 
other 
vital 
projects; 
(7) urges the Department of State, the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment, and other relevant agencies to 
continue to support Mongolia’s democratic 
and economic development and efforts on 
anticorruption; 
(8) reaffirms the importance of civil soci-
ety to the continued democratic develop-
ment of Mongolia; 
(9) encourages the Government of Mongolia 
to build a regulatory system that supports 
and encourages the growth and operation of 
independent nongovernmental organizations 
and continues to pursue policies of trans-
parency that uphold democratic values; and 
(10) encourages the Government of Mon-
golia to continue legal reform, institutional 
capacity building, and to improve the inde-
pendence of other democratic institutions.

amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic as follows: 
Whereas artists, journalists, and activists in 
Cuba have faced increased censorship, persecu-
tion, and arbitrary detention by the Government 
of Cuba as a result of Decrees 349 and 370, 
which seek to restrict artistic freedoms and si-
lence independent media in Cuba; 
Whereas, in December 2018, Decree 349 entered 
into force, requiring that artists and those who 
hire them receive prior approval from the Gov-
ernment of Cuba to operate in public or private 
spaces or otherwise be subject to confiscation of 
materials, fines, or sanctions without the right 
to an appeal; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Decree 370 entered into 
force, regulating and imposing sanctions with 
respect to the free distribution of information 
through the internet and leading to increased 
repression, arbitrary detentions, and censorship 
by the Government of Cuba; 
Whereas international human rights organi-
zations, including Human Rights Watch, Am-
nesty International, the United Nations Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
and the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights, have condemned Decrees 349 and 370 as 
violating fundamental freedoms and contra-
dicting Article 54 of the 2019 Constitution of 
Cuba, which guarantees freedom of expression; 
Whereas, in 2018, the San Isidro Movement 
(MSI), an organization of artists, activists, aca-
demics, and journalists, began to peacefully pro-
test increased censorship and persecution in 
Cuba; 
Whereas Denis Solı´s Gonza´lez, a musician and 
member of the San Isidro Movement, was de-
tained on November 9, 2020, and sentenced to 8 
months in prison on ‘‘contempt of authority’’ 
charges after sharing a live video online of a po-
lice officer entering his home without a war-
rant; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2020, artists and ac-
tivists from the San Isidro Movement launched 
a day of poetry and gathered at a private resi-
dence to discuss actions to protest the arbitrary 
detention of Denis Solı´s Gonza´lez, and during 
that peaceful activity, state police blocked ac-
cess to the house, confiscating all food and hu-
manitarian supplies; 
Whereas, in response to the events of Novem-
ber 19, 2020, 14 independent artists and activists 
went on a 7-day hunger strike at the private 
residence, during which state authorities alleg-
edly contaminated water sources in order to 
sicken the artists, activists, and those sup-
porting them through the strike; 
Whereas, on November 26, 2020, state security 
agents forcibly entered the protest site to remove 
the 14 artists and activists and 6 others sup-
porting them through the strike, blocking inter-
net connectivity and communications through-
out Cuba during the raid; 
Whereas, on November 27, 2020, approximately 
300 people gathered outside the Ministry of Cul-
ture of Cuba to peacefully protest the lack of ar-
tistic freedom in Cuba and the arbitrary arrest 
of Denis Solı´s Gonza´lez and other artists and 
activists in an unprecedented demonstration 
against the Government of Cuba, and, despite 
the use of tear gas by state security forces, the 
protesters were undeterred; 
Whereas, as a result of the protest on Novem-
ber 27, 2020, Cuban officials met with 30 artists 
and activists, including 5 leaders of the San 
Isidro Movement, and agreed to stop harassment 
of Cuban artists and initiate a dialogue between 
the San Isidro Movement, other activists, and 
the government; 
Whereas, despite that commitment by Cuban 
officials, the Government of Cuba subsequently 
escalated its attacks against the artists and ac-
tivists who participated in the meeting, includ-
ing by surrounding and blocking access to their 
homes; 
Whereas the Cuban regime used state-con-
trolled media to label the hunger strikers as 
committing acts of terrorism; 
Whereas, on December 4, 2020, the Govern-
ment of Cuba unilaterally ended the dialogue 
process with Cuban artists and independent 
civil society and political activists; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, officials of the 
Ministry of Culture, led by Minister Alpidio 
Alonso and Vice Ministers Fernando Rojas and 
Fernando Leo´n Jacomino, physically assaulted 
a group of 20 to 30 artists who had gathered 
outside the Ministry of Culture to restart a dia-
logue process with authorities and demand an 
end to the repression of the artistic community; 
Whereas, following the assault on the group 
by Minister Alonso and Vice Ministers Rojas 
and Jacomino, Cuban state security forces vio-
lently detained protesters; and 
Whereas, despite the suspension of the dia-
logue process by the Government of Cuba, art-
ists, activists, and independent journalists con-
tinue to bravely advocate for fundamental free-
doms and denounce human rights violations in 
Cuba: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses solidarity with the members of 
the San Isidro Movement and their efforts to ad-
vance freedom of expression in Cuba; 
(2) calls on Cuban authorities to engage in a 
meaningful dialogue process with the members 
of the San Isidro Movement and other artists 
and activists seeking to advance freedom of ex-
pression in Cuba; 
(3) calls on the Government of Cuba to imme-
diately release Denis Solı´s Gonza´lez and other 
arbitrarily imprisoned artists and journalists; 
(4) urges the officials of the Ministry of Cul-
ture of Cuba to refrain from physical violence 
and any other acts of repression against Cuban 
artists and journalists; 
(5) calls for the immediate repeal of Decrees 
349 and 370 and other laws in Cuba that violate 
freedom of expression; 
(6) urges governments and legislatures in Eu-
rope and Latin America to renew their support 
for democratic activists in Cuba and speak out 
against the repression of artists and journalists 
in Cuba; and 
(7) encourages the Secretary of State to con-
demn the persecution, threats, and intimidation 
of Cuban artists and journalists. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I further ask that the 
committee-reported amendment to the 
resolution be considered agreed to; 
that the resolution, as amended, be 
agreed to; that the committee-report 
amendment to the preamble be agreed 
to; that the preamble, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 37), as amend-
ed, was agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble in the nature of a sub-
stitute was agreed to. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows:

secution, and arbitrary detention by the

HONORING ARMY BRIGADIER 
GENERAL ISABEL RIVERA SMITH 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the accomplishments of an extraor-
dinary woman and hometown heroine, Briga-
dier General Isabel Rivera Smith of Lorain, 
Ohio. 
BGen Smith, who was born and raised in 
Lorain, Ohio, was a member of Sacred Heart 
Parish and a graduate of Admiral King High 
School. 
She first enlisted into the active Army in Oc-
tober of 1985 as a Motor Transport Operator, 
with her first duty station at Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina. 
In 1988, she enlisted in the North Carolina 
Army National Guard and in 1989 she trans-
ferred to the New York Army National Guard. 
She was commissioned as a Second Lieuten-
ant in the Quartermaster Corps after grad-
uating from Officer Candidate School. 
BGen Smith’s command assignments and 
operational deployment include Commander of 
HHD, 53rd Troop Command, Commander of 
the 369th Special Troops Battalion and Deputy 
Team Chief-Iraq Police National Headquarters 
in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2010. 
Her key staff assignments include Assistant 
Operational Officer at the 27th Rear Area Op-
erations Center; personalist for the 369th 
Corps Support Battalion, Assistant Chief of 
Staff for Personnel, G1 for the 53rd Troop 
Command, Executive Officer of the 106th Re-
gional Training Institute, Deputy Director of Lo-
gistics (J4) for the New York National Guard, 
Executive Officer for the Office of the Adjutant 
General, and the Chief of Staff for the 53rd 
Troop Command. 
BGen Smith’s awards include the Legion of 
Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious 
Service Medal, the Army Commendation 
Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the 
Humanitarian Service Medal. She is also the 
recipient of the 2017 Latina Style Military 
Service Award. 
BGen Smith holds a bachelor’s degree in 
Human Services from Mount St. Mary’s Col-
lege, a master’s degree in Education in Coun-
seling and Development from Long Island Uni-
versity and a master’s degree in Strategic 
Studies from the United States Army War Col-
lege. 
She and her husband Peter have six daugh-
ters: Antoinette, Amelia, Karissa, Kassandra, 
Jessica, and Shannon, and one son: Jamarr. 
They are also the proud grandparents of nine 
grandchildren. 
Our country could not be prouder of Briga-
dier General Isabel Rivera Smith, a daughter 
of Ohio, trailblazer, and a true American pa-
triot. The words of Army General Omar Brad-
ley aptly capture BGen Smith’s professional 
accomplishments: ‘‘Leadership is intangible, 
and therefore no weapon ever designed can 
replace it.’’ 
CHEYENNE MYLA VERHAEGHE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Cheyenne 
Myla Verhaeghe for receiving the Adams 
County Mayors and Commissioners Youth 
Award. 
Cheyenne Myla Verhaeghe is a 12th grader 
at Thornton High School and received this 
award because her determination and hard 
work have allowed her to overcome adversi-
ties. 
The dedication demonstrated by Cheyenne 
Myla Verhaeghe is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Cheyenne Myla Verhaeghe for winning the 
Adams County Mayors and Commissioners 
Youth Award. I have no doubt she will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in all of her 
future accomplishments.

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ‘‘MICKEY’’ 
DEPALO 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Michael ‘‘Mickey’’ DePalo for his in-
numerable contributions to veterans and the 
residents of the City of Burbank, California. 
Mickey has been a Burbank resident for 
sixty-five years. He graduated from Burbank 
High School in 1964, and the following year, 
began his four-decades-long career with the 
City of Burbank Parks and Recreation Depart-
ment. Shortly after graduating from college, 
Mr. DePalo briefly left the City of Burbank to 
honorably serve in the U.S. Army for two 
years during the Vietnam War. 
As a child, Mickey played many sports, in-
cluding flag football, baseball, softball and 
basketball. His love of sports continued into 
adulthood, and along with participating in Bur-
bank sports leagues, he has generously volun-
teered his time and knowledge to the sports 
organizations for decades. He was a volunteer 
baseball, flag football and basketball coach for 
the City’s Parks and Recreation Department, 
and a volunteer assistant coach for his son, 
Michael’s youth basketball teams. Additionally, 
Mr. DePalo was Loyola High School Cross 
Country Team’s volunteer coach and the race 
director for Burbank’s Run for the Hungry for 
ten years. 
A staunch advocate for veterans and their 
welfare, Mickey has been Chairperson of the 
Burbank Veterans Commemorative Committee 
and the emcee for the Veterans Day and Me-
morial Day ceremonies at McCambridge Park 
in Burbank for over thirty years. Under his 
leadership, the committee has organized nu-
merous veterans events in Burbank, including 
one event that Mr. DePalo is most proud of— 
assisting the City in 1998 to be selected as a 
site to host The Moving Wall, a replica of the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, 
D.C. that tours the nation. He also worked on 
the Hands Across the Battlefield program, 
which partners with community businesses 
and individuals to collect and send supplies to 
our troops, and has raised funds for youth and 
veterans organizations in his role as Sr. Vice 
Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
Post 8310. 
A few of the numerous community awards 
and commendations Mr. DePalo has received 
include the Burbank Association of Realtors’ 
Citizen of the Year Award, an induction into 
the City of Burbank’s Athletics Walk of Fame, 
the L.A. County Older Americans Volunteer 
Service Award, and the Veteran of the Year 
Award from both Assemblyman Paul Krekorian 
in 2009 and from Assemblymember Laura 
Friedman in 2017. 
It is my honor to call Michael ‘‘Mickey’’ 
DePalo a friend and I want to thank him for 
over half a century of extraordinary support 
and dedication to our nation’s veterans and 
the community of Burbank. I ask all Members 
to join me in paying tribute to this extraor-
dinary American patriot.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GRACE 
PUGH 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great sadness that I rise to honor the life 
of Grace Pugh, a West Covina resident who 
died on April 6, 2021. 
For over 38 years, Ms. Pugh served as a 
volunteer for the American Cancer Society, 
and as a Legislative Ambassador with the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-
work. She was a three-time breast cancer sur-
vivor and saw first-hand its devastating im-
pact. Ms. Pugh lost both her mother and her 
grandson to cancer, and her two sisters were 
cancer survivors. This personal experience 
helped drive her deep and profound commit-
ment to fight back against cancer. 
As an advocate with the American Cancer 
Society Cancer Action Network, Ms. Pugh 
used her boundless energy and passion to 
help build bipartisan support for legislation to 
help advance the fight against cancer. She 
traveled multiple times to Washington, D.C. 
and Sacramento, CA to meet with her elected 
representatives, and regularly visited their dis-
trict offices, sent emails, and made phone 
calls to convey the importance and urgency of 
making the fight against cancer a top priority. 
Ms. Pugh devoted countless hours of her 
time and worked tirelessly to help educate 
people about prevention and early detection, 
and support for patients, survivors, and care-
givers. She dedicated herself to the American 
Cancer Society’s patient support services, in-
cluding the Reach to Recovery Program, 
which provides one-on-one support to those 
diagnosed with breast cancer.

TEAMS 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, as an avid 
basketball player, it gives me great pleasure to 
recognize the exceptional achievements of all 
of the high-school basketball players in North-
west Indiana this past year, who safely 
showed up and put in the effort during the 
challenges of this health pandemic. I also 
want to recognize the following high-school 
basketball programs from Indiana’s First Con-
gressional District who represented our region 
during Semi-State and beyond this past sea-
son. Those teams include the Crown Point 
women’s team, the Gary West Side men’s 
team, and the Kouts men’s team. 
First, congratulations to the Lady Bulldogs 
of the Crown Point High School women’s bas-
ketball team who won the Indiana High School 
Athletic Association’s 4A State Championship 
on February 27, 2021. Special recognition also 
to Coach Chris Seibert who was appropriately 
named the 2021 Girls Basketball Coach of the 
Year by our leading local newspapers, the 
Post-Tribune 
and 
the 
Northwest 
Indiana 
Times, and also Jessica Carrothers who was 
named the Northwest Indiana Times 2021 
Girls Basketball Player of the Year. I am in-
spired by the camaraderie of their team and 
the demonstration of how their hard-work has 
truly paid off. 
Additionally, congratulations to the Gary 
West Side High School men’s basketball team 
who won their Regional championship game 
to advance to Indiana’s Class 4A Semi-State 
on March 20, 2021. The Cougars fought their 
way for every second, taking the game to 
overtime where they lost by a mere five 
points. I applaud Coach Chris Buggs, his 
coaching staff, and the men who gave it their 
all to the very end. 
And I also congratulate the Kouts High 
School men’s basketball team for winning the 
Semi-State Championship for the first time in 
the school’s history. The Mustangs competed 
in the IHSAA Class IA State Tournament on 
April 3, 2021, and ended their season with an 
overall record of 29–3. I applaud Coach Kevin 
Duzan and these young men for their suc-
cessful season and the legacy they have left. 
These truly remarkable teams achieved 
great success during this very challenging 
year. For their skill, tremendous hard work, 
dedication to the game, and for representing 
our region, these outstanding young athletes 
deserve to be recognized and congratulated 
for their incredible seasons. 
Madam Speaker, please join me again in 
congratulating our basketball players on their 
achievements and for making all of Northwest 
Indiana and their schools, families, and com-
munities so very proud.

ONESTAR 
NATIONAL 
SERVICE 
COMMISSION 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Michelle Brewer for her appointment by 
Governor Abbott to the prestigious OneStar 
National Service Commission. The Commis-
sion actively seeks out opportunities for Texas 
volunteers and charitable organizations to en-
gage and connect with one another, and ac-
celerates their impact on local communities. 
Furthermore, OneStar manages and operates 
the Rebuild Texas Fund, an organization dedi-
cated to assisting Texans who are still feeling 
the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. 
Michelle’s time and experience with Hardin 
County Strong as Disaster Recovery Director 
has more than prepared her for this role. Over 
her past four years as director, Michelle was 
fundamental in helping her community recover 
from Hurricane Harvey, and she was able to 
use critical connections, resources, and her 
vast wealth of knowledge to bring desperately 
needed assistance to Hardin County in an ex-
pedited manner. 
The most important duty of every public 
servant is giving back to the community they 
serve. Madam Speaker, I would like to honor 
my friend, Michelle Brewer, for her work expe-
rience and time in Hardin County that dem-
onstrate she more than exceeds this expecta-
tion. I cannot think of an individual better suit-
ed for this position.

OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Leonard Crofford, who turns 100 
years old today. Born on April 15th, 1921 and 
raised in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Leonard met 
the love of his life, Rosaline (Rosie), when he 
was 15, and they got married shortly before 
he joined the Navy two years later. He first 
served in the U.S. Navy at Wheeler Army Air-
field near Pearl Harbor in 1939. Leonard was 
just 15 miles away when Japan launched its 
December 7, 1941 attack on the base, throw-
ing him from his bunk due to the aftershock 
from a bomb blast. Two years later, he joined 
the U.S. Army, spending most of his service 
overseas as a mechanic and teaching other 
soldiers how to repair tanks. In 1945, he was 
honorably discharged as a Master Sergeant. 
On October 6, 1945, Leonard married Rosie in 
Hammond, Indiana; and together they raised 
five children: Ronnie, Leonard, Diane, Connie, 
and Sharon. Forty years ago, Leonard and 
Rosie moved to Thompsonville, Illinois, spend-
ing the remainder of their remarkable 75-year 
marriage together, until Rosie passed away at 
the age of 97 on February 22, 2020. Leonard 
has carried on the traditions they shared, like 
attending Parish Church and gardening. Every

HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO

Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the Fairmont High School Boys 
Bowling Team in Kettering, Ohio, which is in 
my congressional district, on winning the Divi-
sion I state championship. 
After nine previous appearances in the state 
tournament, this year’s win was a fitting finish 
to an historic season that saw the Fairmont 
Firebirds bowling team bring home its first- 
ever state title. Months of preparation, prac-
tice, and experience enabled these talented 
athletes to out-bowl the competition and roll to 
victory in the tournament. These young men 
have set an example for all of us that success 
in life comes to those who are willing to set 
goals, and work hard to achieve them. 
I congratulate Head Coach Jeremy Fleck 
and Assistant Coach Matt Mahaffey on their 
victory in the state championship, and espe-
cially the student athletes: Dayton Foster; 
Dylan Potts; Tyler Milton; Tyler Stegemoller; 
Colton Mahaffey; and Isaiah Shannon. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating the young men on the Fairmont High 
School Bowling Team on their hard-fought vic-
tory. They have made all of us from the Miami

REMEMBERING CORA CRAWFORD

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
my constituent, Mrs. Cora Crawford and cele-
brate her incredible life and legacy. 
Mrs. Crawford moved to Palm Springs in the 
1950s from Carthage, Texas, where she 
began her lifelong work as a community advo-
cate. She attended the College of the Desert 
where she obtained her teaching credentials 
and a masters in education. As a substitute 
teacher in the City of Palm Springs, Mrs. 
Crawford was a devoted educator who put her 
heart and soul into every class she taught.

Mrs. Crawford carried her passion for edu-
cation and community development with her 
outside of the classroom. She served as the 
local director for the Child Development Cen-
ter and worked hard to secure the resources 
local students needed to succeed. In fact, she 
was a key advocate in obtaining $350,000 in 
federal dollars from the Community Develop-
ment Block Grant to benefit Desert Highland 
Park. Thanks to her efforts, Desert Highland 
Park now offers essential community services 
for local students and their families, including 
recreational, educational, and vocational pro-
grams. 
The legacy of Mrs. Crawford’s work is in-
credible. In the 1980s, she helped organize 
the very first Black History Month Parade in 
Palm Springs—a parade our community con-
tinues to proudly host each year. In all her 
years of volunteering and service, her tremen-
dous work did not go unnoticed. The Palm 
Springs City Council and the California Baptist 
Convention Women’s Auxiliary awarded her 
numerous conunendations. In 1997, she was 
honored with the Terra Volunteer Award from 
the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce. In 
2012, she was recognized yet again for her 
commitment as a community leader and edu-
cator when Riverside County awarded her the 
Community Service Award. 
Mrs. Crawford is survived by her children, 
Benita, Gil, Gwendolyn, and Randy. She is 
also survived by her nine grandchildren, 
Symeyon, Kenneth, Jarvis, Kristen, Usavia, 
Nyssa, Kyle, Deiter, and Javanni. I extend my 
deepest condolence to each of them. I also 
want to share my special condolences and 
support for my friend and her grandson, Jar-
vis. He, like his grandmother, continues to ad-
vocate for his community through social justice 
initiatives and uphold her legacy of making 
sure those who are in need, can find solace 
in community. 
May Mrs. Crawford’s work continue to uplift 
and inspire.

IN RECOGNITION AND HONOR OF 
THE LIFE OF ELANA THOMAS 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to recognize the 
life and legacy of a special member of my 
community, Ms. Elana Thomas, who went to 
be with her Savior on March 1, 2021. 
Elana was born May 7, 1948, in the small 
rural community of Sneads, Florida. Sur-
rounded by pine forests and agricultural land, 
Sneads and greater Jackson County are home 
to hard-working men and women, many of 
great faith and fortitude. Elana was no excep-
tion. 
Her life was not marked by monetary wealth 
or great business achievements, but her im-
pact within her community was vast. She was 
not an elected official, but she was a leader to 
those who knew her. She was a trusted coun-
selor and friend to many, a sounding board, 
and a valued advisor. She will be sorely 
missed, but those who knew her in life are as-
sured she is in a much better place. Her faith 
in God was the bedrock she built her life 
upon. 
Elana was a devoted church member of St. 
Peter Missionary Baptist Church for more than 
30 years, often serving as a lay speaker or 
leading songs during services. She taught 
teens during Sunday School and was the 
president of the church’s ushers’ ministry. She 
had a comprehensive knowledge of the Bible, 
which she read and studied every day. She 
would often quote scripture to folks in crisis, 
providing them with relatable passages that 
might help them get through the period of tur-
moil they were experiencing. She counseled 
those in distress, providing loving and kind ad-
vice and direction to those who sought it from 
her. 
She ministered with members of her church 
to inmates at nearby Apalachee Correctional 
Institution, volunteering her time and treasure 
to help men who had strayed from the path re-
gain their footing for an eventual successful 
restoration back to their communities. She 
performed local missionary work, helping 
those less fortunate with a helping hand, a 
kind word, and a shoulder to lean upon. 
When her mother fell ill, she diligently vis-
ited her every day she was able, in the as-
sisted living facility, even after her own health 
made it difficult to do so. When her mother 
passed away, it was Elana who gave the eu-
logy, speaking eloquently and from the heart 
about her mother to the assembled family and 
friends who came to mourn her passing. Elana 
never let her health issues deter her from the 
service she was called to do. 
Madam Speaker, allow me this moment to 
express 
condolences 
to 
Elana’s 
family, 
friends, and colleagues. Though her presence 
will be sorely missed by many, I pray we may 
find solace in remembering her legacy for 
years to come. On March 13, 2021, family and 
friends traveled from far and near to celebrate 
her life and her church family was in attend-
ance in great numbers. In the words of Bishop 
Adrian Abner of St. Peter Missionary Baptist 
Church, ‘‘Elana lived a life of devotion to those 
less fortunate. She was a woman of great faith 
and prayer and a treasured member of this 
church and our community. She touched many 
with her kindness in word and deed.’’ She 
leaves treasured memories with one son, 
Eddie D. Lovett, II and wife Susan of Raleigh, 
North Carolina; one brother, Jimmy Walker of 
Oxon Hill, Maryland; two grandchildren; and a 
host of relatives and friends. I join the entire 
community in honoring Elana Thomas for her 
dedicated life of service to others.

TRIBUTE TO THE OHIO NATIONAL 
GUARD 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of the people of the 15th Congres-
sional District of Ohio to express sincere grati-
tude to the dedicated men and women of the 
Ohio National Guard for their exemplary com-
mitment to service and to our great State. 
Since the creation of the force in 1788, 
these extraordinary individuals have prioritized 
the health and safety of communities from Wil-
mington to McConnelsville, from Hilliard to 
McArthur. But in the past year, the citizen-sol-
diers of the Buckeye State have truly em-
braced their role as a ‘‘trusted team of sol-
diers, airmen, and civilians,’’ serving through 
‘‘agility, collaboration, excellence, and leader-
ship.’’ 
Through a once-in-a-generation pandemic, 
the Ohio National Guard provided invaluable 
support. From manning food banks and man-
aging COVID–19 testing locations at the onset 
of the pandemic, to now administering vac-
cines to their fellow Ohioans, our State is in-
credibly grateful for their service. 
As the coronavirus raged, our nation saw a 
period of social unrest unlike anything in re-
cent decades. Once again, the Ohio National 
Guard answered the call. Whether it was the 
Statehouse in Columbus, or the Capitol in 
Washington, our soldiers were willing to put 
their own safety in jeopardy in order to ensure 
the wellbeing of their fellow citizens. 
Perhaps at no point in recent history has 
more been asked of our National Guard, and 
at no point have they answered with more 
conviction. They worked diligently day-in and 
day-out, never failing to embody the motto, 
‘‘Always Ready. Always There.’’ 
As a Major General, and as a Member of 
Congress, I am filled with pride and gratitude 
of these men and women and of the sacrifices 
that they have made. It is an honor to recog-
nize their hard work, and I ask my fellow col-
leagues to join me in expressing thanks for all 
that they have done, and all that they will do, 
for Ohio and our nation.

CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF 
JOHN YOUNG 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of John Young, 
a remarkable community leader and activist 
who spent more than 30 years uplifting under-
served communities in the North Bay Area. 
John was born on October 25, 1952 in San 
Francisco, CA. He grew up in Marin City and 
attended Tamalpais High School and College 
of Marin. John went on to study public policy 
at San Francisco State University, where he 
developed a passion for social justice. 
Recognizing the need to confront economic, 
health, and education inequities, John com-
mitted his career to championing more inclu-
sive social policies. At the Marin City Commu-
nity Development Corporation, John went to 
bat for the community that raised him, helping 
to plan and launch critical revitalization 
projects. The Canal Neighborhood in San 
Rafael benefitted from John’s talents as an or-
ganizer and housing specialist for the Canal 
Community Alliance. John also successfully 
managed more than $5 million in grants for 
programs supporting low economic and dis-
advantaged populations across the Bay Area. 
John was a skilled problem solver who was 
able to effect change by bringing people to-
gether. In founding the Marin County Grass-
roots Leadership Network, he assembled a co-
alition for underrepresented residents to unite 
and speak with one voice. This helped secure 
more equitable policy outcomes, including 
housing, transportation, labor, and voting 
rights. In addition, more than 300 rising lead-
ers were mentored and trained through the or-
ganization. 
Friends, family, and colleagues knew John 
for his big personality that could brighten any 
room. With a deep sense of compassion and 
a people-first attitude, John embodied all the 
qualities of a fierce community organizer. Al-
though he will be sorely missed, John’s legacy 
will live on through the lasting positive impact 
he had on our community and beyond. 
John’s hard work made a transformative dif-
ference in the lives of many. Madam Speaker, 
I respectfully ask that you join me in extending 
condolence to John’s family and friends and in 
expressing our deep appreciation for John’s 
extraordinary career and life.

INSULAR AREA MEDICAID PARITY 
ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Northern Mariana Islands Wage 
and Economic Stability Act. This legislation 
delays for 18 months, in the Marianas only, 
any national increase in the federal minimum 
wage that Congress may enact. My bill, also, 
requires a Government Accountability Office 
report on the economic impact in the Marianas 
of such a national wage increase. 
Unlike the rest of our nation, where min-
imum wage has been static, the minimum 
wage in the Marianas has more than doubled 
over recent years to reach the federal level of 
$7.25. 
These substantial increases have made life 
better for thousands of Marianas families and 
encouraged more U.S. workers to enter the 
workforce. 
But I had to carefully time those increases 
year-by-year with legislation and based on the 
help of Government Accountability Office re-
ports to ensure—successfully—that wages 
went up without jeopardizing jobs. 
Economic conditions in the Marianas remain 
separate from the national situation. Whereas 
Gross Domestic Product rose nationally in 
2019, in the Marianas GDP plunged 11.2 per-
cent that year. That decline came after a 19.3 
percent decrease in 2018. And it is reasonable 
to expect the picture in the Marianas for 2020 
will be no better. Our tourism-based economy 
will remain dormant until the pandemic has 
passed. Meanwhile, nationally, we expect 
growth on the order of 6 percent this year. 
My point is simply this: If we are going to 
raise the wage in the Marianas—and, believe 
me, I do—then we must do it as we did be-
fore: with a close eye on the economic condi-
tions in the islands. They are vastly different 
than conditions in the nation as a whole. 
Again, I fully support raising the minimum 
wage in our country. It has been static too 
long. I am a cosponsor of the Raise the Wage 
Act—I want workers to earn more. 
I believe the best way to accomplish that 
goal in the insular area I represent, however, 
is through my legislation, the Northern Mar-
iana Islands Wage and Economic Stability Act. 
My bill will give Congress the analytical tools 
and the time to consider how best to schedule 
wage increases in the Marianas to improve 
the lives of workers and their families, while 
ensuring the businesses employing those 
workers can thrive.

that meet criteria related to the inclusion of 
underrepresented minority individuals in pro-
grams and activities. 
NIMHD leads scientific research to improve 
minority health and eliminate health disparities 
by researching and evaluating all minority 
health and health disparities research at NIH. 
The 
NIMHD’s 
Centers 
of 
Excellence 
(COE)’s program fosters collaborative re-
search in minority health and health dispari-
ties, and awards grants to institutions that 
have a specific unifying focus on addressing 
minority health and health disparities. 
NIMHD Centers of Excellence program 
grants are awarded in order to: 
Support innovative multi- and trans-discipli-
nary research to promote minority health and 
reduce health disparities; 
Strengthen exemplary research training and 
education activities support the development 
of well-trained researchers from minority and 
health disparity populations; 
Increase the number of individuals from mi-
nority and other health disparity populations 
participating in research activities; and 
Provide support for engaging minority and 
other health disparity communities in effective 
and sustainable activities aimed at improving 
the health of their communities. 
Racial health inequalities in the U.S. is the 
cumulative result of both past and present dis-
crimination throughout U.S. culture, and the 
NIMHD centers of racial excellence program 
grants are essential to addressing these in-
equalities. 
African Americans are not only more sus-
ceptible to disease and illness, they are also 
more likely to die from them. 
This past year, as COVID–19 has ravaged 
African Americans and communities of color, 
we have seen firsthand the fruits of these in-
equalities. 
According to the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), African Americans face 
increased risks if they are stricken with 
COVID–19, including asthma, diabetes, high 
blood pressure, heart disease and pulmonary 
illness. 
African American lives are placed at greater 
risk because of a health care system that de-
nies access to the poor and work conditions 
that have long neglected conditions that leave 
them with a higher incidence of diseases that 
for far too long have gone under diagnosed 
and untreated. 
There are many reasons for this but they in-
clude the refusal of several states to expand 
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act; the 
resistance of small business employers to pro-
vide health care to workers until required by 
their state government to do so, and too little 
access to medical doctors who are trained to 
provide care to this COVID–19 at-risk popu-
lation. 
Since 2003, I have been working on major 
legislation to address the problem with several 
of my colleagues including Representatives 
Elijah E. Cummings, Chair of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus (CBC), Delegate Donna 
Christensen, 
Chair 
of 
the 
CBC 
Health 
Braintrust, U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, and 
the leadership of the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus, and the Native American 
Caucus. 
Together we produced, the ‘‘Healthcare 
Equality and Accountability Act of 2003,’’ a 
truly comprehensive bill designed to address 
the disparities that face our communities. 
During my time in office, I have fully and ea-
gerly supported all legislation that has given 
increased attention to HIV/AIDS, including the 
Ryan White CARE Act, which is currently slat-
ed to receive about $2.2 billion in funding for 
FY2007. 
I have supported legislation to reauthorize 
funding for community health centers (H.R. 
5573, Health Centers Renewal Act of 2006), 
including the Montrose and Fourth Ward clin-
ics in my home city of Houston, as well as 
supported legislation to provide more nurses 
for the poor urban communities in which many 
of these centers are located (H.R. 1285, Nurs-
ing Relief Act for Disadvantaged Areas). 
I have also supported and introduced legis-
lation aimed to better educate our children 
(H.R. 2553, Responsible Education About Life 
Act in 2006) and eliminate health disparities 
(H.R. 3561, Healthcare Equality and Account-
ability Act and the Good Medicine Cultural 
Competency Act in 2003, H.R. 90). 
Mr. Speaker, we need strong collaborations 
and research based upon asking the right 
questions in specific areas, and the COEs are 
poised to emphasize scientific inquiry that will 
promote health equity. 
Government has an obligation to seek the 
best for our nation’s people, especially our na-
tion’s children. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 189, the John Lewis NIMHD Re-
search Endowment Revitalization Act of 2021, 
because improved public health benefits all 
Americans, no matter who they are or where

The FTC must submit the report to Con-
gress and make it publicly available. 
The FTC is directed to update its website to 
include information for consumers and busi-
nesses on identifying and avoiding unfair or 
deceptive practices that target tribes or tribal 
members. 
Scammers are targeting Native people. 
Scammers may say extra money is waiting 
for a small price upfront or that a testing kit or 
treatment for the coronavirus is available for a 
fee. 
Other scams attempt to benefit from the 
$1,200 Economic Impact Payment coming to 
most U.S. citizens; and more are expected to 
target stimulus checks authorized under the 
America Rescue Plan. 
At least one tribal leader has warned tribal 
citizens of an email scam related to the 
coronavirus. 
In an April 14 Facebook post, Ojibwe Chief 
Executive Melanie Benjamin wrote that an 
email purporting to be her had tribal citizens to 
purchase gift cards to help a citizen who test-
ed positive for the coronavirus. 
Benjamin asks those that may have re-
ceived the scam email from a Gmail account 
to contact tribal police. 
This bill will help protect our diverse Native 
American communities from scammers by pro-
viding valuable information that will help iden-
tify fraudsters and arm people with tools to 
protect themselves. 
Our friends in the Native American commu-
nities across the nation have faced tremen-
dous challenges during COVID–19 and they 
need our help to keep their nation’s physically 
and financial safe during COVID. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill.

HOUSE RESOURCES REPUBLICAN 
FORUM 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 15, 2021 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, it is a unique 
responsibility to be the sole Congressman for 
Alaska in the House of Representatives. 
It’s easy for legislators to forget that life is 
different in Alaska, and it is my highest priority 
to ensure that Alaskans are not overlooked 
here in Washington, D.C. 
One of the principal lessons I have learned 
in my years of service are the check and bal-
ances between the three branches of govern-
ment inscribed by our Founding Fathers in our 
Constitution. 
While the President of the United States 
governs the Executive Branch, Congress 
writes our laws and that’s something we too 
often forget here. 
Article I of the Constitution states: ‘‘All legis-
lative Powers herein granted shall be vested 
in a Congress of the United States, which 
shall consist of a Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives.’’ 
That said the President can only enforce 
legislation that Congress has drafted and ap-
proved. 
The real power of this country lies within 
this Capitol building and we need to act like it. 
For over 48 years I have worked tirelessly 
to address the crucial infrastructure and en-
ergy needs throughout Alaska. 
Before being elected to public office, I saw 
firsthand Alaska’s lack of traditional infrastruc-
ture while I was a tug and barge operator 
along the Yukon River. 
But I could also see the potential economic 
development that communities and rural vil-
lages could achieve if they were given the re-
sources to put ideas into action. 
It is that driving knowledge that guides me 
as I work to support federal investment in 
Alaska’s energy infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E404 
April 15, 2021 
Unfortunately, the Biden Administration is 
continuing Obama-era attacks against Alaska. 
By reviewing federal rules that support Alas-
ka and by placing a moratorium on energy de-
velopment in ANWR, President Biden seems 
intent to surrender to his party’s environmental 
extremists. 
I want the President to know this: Alaskans 
have shown for decades that energy develop-
ment and environmental protection can go 
hand in hand. 
The executive actions he has taken in his 
first days in office serve only to hinder our 
state’s economy, stifle energy independence, 
and prevent the Alaska Native community of 
Kaktovik from responsibly using their lands. 
Tomorrow I will be proudly introducing Alas-
ka’s own Mathew Rexford, at the House Nat-
ural Resources Republican Forum titled, 
‘‘Where are the Jobs?’’ 
Mr. Rexford is the President of the Kaktovik 
Inupiat Corporation and a strong leader. 
The Alaska community of Kaktovik has long 
advocated for access to their lands and the 
opening of ANWR. 
Development in the 1002 Area of ANWR 
would create countless jobs, revenue streams, 
provide for infrastructure and improve the 
health and economic well-being of the indige-
nous people. 
While the United States should continue 
working to reduce emissions, doing so in a 
way that denies the opportunity for incre-
mental improvements and technological inno-
vations over time is unreasonable. 
Resource development in ANWR would be 
a major win for out nations energy independ-
ence and security for decades to come. 
I’m proud to stand with my friend Mathew 
Rexford to ensure that Kaktovik is heard on 
this issue. 
I hope that the administration will listen and 
engage with native leaders like Mathew 
Rexford and I look forward to our forum tomor-
row.

PROTECTING SENIORS FROM 
EMERGENCY SCAMS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 446, the ‘‘Protecting Seniors 
from Emergency Scams Act,’’ which requires 
the Federal Trade Commission to report on, 
and increase awareness regarding, scams tar-
geting older adults. 
The FTC must: report on the number and 
type of scams that target older adults and pro-
vide policy recommendations to prevent such 
scams; revise the commission’s web portal 
with current information about such scams, in-
cluding contact information for law enforce-
ment and protective services agencies; and 
coordinate with media outlets and law enforce-
ment to disseminate such information. 
Our seniors should not be victims of scams 
during coronavirus pandemic. 
This bipartisan legislation will help protect 
seniors from fraud during this public health cri-
sis and prevent emergency-related scams in 
the future. 
Every year scam artists target senior citi-
zens resulting in financial losses between $2 
billion and $12 billion, and now during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, these scammers are 
using fear and uncertainty to take advantage 
of our vulnerable populations. 
Our seniors have borne the brunt of this 
pandemic in high infection rates and deaths. 
Now many seniors are being targeted by 
scammers who prey on their COVID–19 fears. 
We must pass this bill and work to educate 
our seniors and those who care for them to 
look out for scams. 
There is a moral obligation to stop these 
con artists by empowering seniors with facts 
and information while aggressively targeting 
criminals with all the resources available 
through the Federal Trade Commission. 
Throughout the pandemic, uncertainty has 
led to many Houstonians falling victim to scam 
callers especially vulnerable populations like 
seniors. 
Houston police and the Harris County Dis-
trict Attorney have made an arrest in an inter-
national cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, 
mostly elderly victims out of more than $1 mil-
lion. 
One victim of the scam, Asuncion Peppers, 
74, a retired medical technician knows that 
first hand; She was bilked out of her life sav-
ings. 
Hackers 
contacted 
Ms. 
Peppers 
on 
Facebook, pretending to be one of her 
Facebook friends. 
She was told she was eligible for a govern-
ment grant of almost one million dollars and 
all she had to do was send a check to pay 
taxes. 
Investigators believes the scammers were 
operating from Nigeria, defrauding senior citi-
zens in the U.S. and around the world. 
Before Peppers realized she was being 
conned, she sent checks totaling $87,000 
hard-earned money. 
She said that she worked three jobs to build 
her life savings. 
In her case the person who received the 
funds was 65-year-old Joe Reyes, who 
washed the funds through several local banks. 
Reyes was receiving funds from scams and 
then converting them into Bitcoin to send back 
to the scammers. 
Peppers and her husband are just two of 38 
victims bilked out of more than $1.3 million be-
fore the fraud was discovered. 
Reyes is now charged with money laun-
dering and other charges that could send him 
to prison for years. 
Our seniors need our help to be physically 
and financial safe during COVID. 
The Protecting Seniors from Emergency 
Scams Act is endorsed by the Elder Justice 
Coalition; American Society on Aging; and the 
National Adult Protective Services Association. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill.

MEMORIAL 
CARBON 
MONOXIDE 
POISONING PREVENTION ACT 0F 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1460, the ‘‘Nicholas 
and Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide 
Poisoning Prevention Act of 2021’’, named 
after two young Minnesotan brothers who died 
of carbon monoxide poisoning, which directs 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC) to award grants to states and tribal or-
ganizations to install carbon monoxide alarms 
in the homes of lowincome families and older 
adults and facilities that commonly serve chil-
dren or older adults. 
The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial 
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act 
would also authorize the CPSC to establish a 
federal grant program to fund education and 
installation of CO detectors by state, local and 
tribal governments. 
With better, commonsense safeguards in 
place, we can address the danger of acci-
dental death by carbon monoxide poisoning, 
which represents a real danger for individuals 
and families. 
According to the Center for Disease Control, 
at least 430 people in the U.S. die each year 
from carbon monoxide poisoning and approxi-
mately 50,000 people are forced to seek med-
ical attention for accidental CO poisoning. 
Carbon monoxide poisoning is an unimagi-
nable way to die—it prevents blood from being 
able to buy into oxygen; causing suffocation 
while still being able to breathe. 
Mr. Speaker, the devastating and unprece-
dented winter storm in Texas finally gave this 
important issue the national attention it de-
serves; but it came at the cost of the lives and 
health of Texans. 
The plunging temperatures and persistent 
power outages this past / February found resi-
dents in my district searching for warmth in-
creasingly from dangerous sources. 
In one dark week in February, fire depart-
ments in Harris County alone responded to 
over 475 carbon monoxide calls. 
During this week, like millions of Texans, 
Etenesh Mersha lost power during the storm. 
In order to provide warmth for herself, her 
husband, and their two children, she turned on 
her car in an attached garage, leading to car-
bon monoxide poisoning for herself and her 
family. 
Etenesh left the car running, and by the 
time help arrived, she and her daughter, 
Rakeb, died; Her husband and 8-year-old son 
were rushed to the hospital and survived. 
A mother and daughter died while trying to 
stay warm because regulators in Texas had 
decided to forgo federal and state regulation. 
At least 300 other cases of carbon mon-
oxide poisoning, were reported in Harris Coun-
ty, making it a disaster within a disaster. 
Although carbon monoxide is not visible, 
there are concrete ways we can protect 
against this unseen threat, including for those 
who are most vulnerable, like children and the 
elderly. 
This legislation bolsters states’ efforts to re-
duce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning 
and help prevent these tragedies in Texas and 
across the nation. 
Mr. Speaker, the CPSC must take action to 
better educate and inform families about the 
risks associated with improper methods to 
heat and power homes and work with the 
media to share this critical information. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 1460, the Nicholas and Zachary 
Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning 
Prevention Act of 2021, because the tragic 
deaths in Texas has shown that this danger 
must be addressed.

MICROLOAN IMPROVEMENT ACT 
OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 1502—the ‘‘Microloan Im-
provement Act of 2021,’’ revises the microloan 
program managed by the Small Business Ad-
ministration (SBA) to provide certain financial 
assistance to small businesses through des-
ignated intermediaries. 
Specifically, the bill authorizes an inter-
mediary to offer a line of credit to a small busi-
ness, and it increases the average amount for 
loans from an intermediary to participating 
small businesses that makes the intermediary 
eligible for a reduced interest rate on SBA 
loans. 
The bill also places limits on the repayment 
term for a microloan, and it prohibits the SBA 
from imposing any additional limitation on the 
term for repayment of a microloan. 
Further, the SBA must: 
reserve 15 percent of new loan funds that 
are made available for disbursement as 
microloans to designated underutilized states 
and make the remaining 85 percent available 
for any state; 
establish a process for an intermediary to 
provide the major credit reporting agencies 
with information about a borrower that is rel-
evant to credit reporting, and 
include information regarding equitable dis-
tribution of loan funds in its annual report. 
The SBA Microloan program approves up to 
$50,000 to small businesses to provide busi-
nesses with working capital, or to purchase in-
ventory, supplies, and equipment. 
Loans for $50,000 may not seem like a lot 
to a small business, but the micro small busi-
nesses that fill our neighborhoods would ben-
efit from having access to these funds. 
A micro enterprise employs nine people or 
fewer, and this is the most common kind of 
private-sector business in the United States. 
Small business statistics show that while 
this might be the most common kind of enter-
prise, its share of employees is very small, 
providing only 10.5 percent of all private-sec-
tor jobs. 
The fortunes of micro businesses during 
COVID–19 has been fraught with risks. 
We know that: 
82 percent of businesses that fail do so be-
cause of cash flow problems; 
Small businesses employ 59 million people 
in the U.S.A; 
50 percent of all small businesses are oper-
ated from home; 
84 percent of small business owners indi-
cate that they’re feeling optimistic about the 
future of their companies; 
64 percent of small business owners begin 
with only $10,000 in capital; 
Approximately a quarter of small businesses 
begin with no financing whatsoever; 
Only 40 percent of small businesses are 
profitable; and 
Only 64 percent of small businesses have 
their own website. 
Thousands of minority-owned small busi-
nesses were shown to be at the end of the 
line in applying to the government’s Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP). 
According to an Associated Press analysis 
of the low-interest government loans, minority 
owners struggled more than white owners to 
find banks that would accept their applications; 
or otherwise were disadvantaged by the terms 
of the program. 
Data from the Paycheck Protection Program 
released December 1 and analyzed by the As-
sociated Press show that many minority own-
ers desperate for a relief loan did not receive 
one until the PPP’s last few weeks, while 
many more white business owners were able 
to get loans earlier in the program. 
The program, which began April 3 and 
ended August 8 and handed out 5.2 million 
loans worth $525 billion, helped many busi-
nesses stay on their feet during a period when 
government 
measures 
to 
control 
the 
coronavirus forced many to shut down or op-
erate at a diminished capacity. 
The PPP program struggled to meet its 
promise of aiding communities that historically 
have not gotten the help they needed. 
The PPP program was especially difficult to 
access for micro businesses. 
A micro business employs nine people or 
fewer, and this is the most common kind of 
private-sector business in the U.S. Small busi-
ness statistics show that while this might be 
the most common kind of enterprise, its share 
of employees is very small, providing only 
10.5 percent of all private-sector jobs. 
As the economy continues to recover, we 
should not forget that not all businesses will 
recover at the same rate, just as all workers 
are not heading back into the workforce with 
the same opportunities to find or resume em-
ployment. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill that will provide much needed financial 
support to our mom and pop businesses.

FRAUD AND SCAM REDUCTION 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1215, the Fraud and 
Scam Reduction Act, which will create the 
Senior Scams Prevention Advisory Group and 
the Senior Fraud Advisory Office to improve 
the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) pre-
vention and response efforts against senior 
fraud and scams through enhanced coordina-
tion with key industries, consumer advocacy 
groups, appropriate law enforcement agen-
cies, and consumers. 
Every day, and far too often, vulnerable 
seniors in Texas and across the country fall 
victim to financial scammers. 
Seniors have worked their entire lives with 
the promise of a safe and secure retirement, 
but unfortunately criminals are taking advan-
tage of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic 
and working overtime to target them. 
Retirement accounts are not the only dam-
age these scams harm—they damage the 
independence and trust of a vulnerable com-
munity. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we have 
seen instances of fraud rise in unprecedented 
numbers, as scammers attempt to take advan-
tage of senior citizens and deprive them of 
their hard-earned savings. 
Bad actors preying on older Americans is, 
unfortunately, nothing new. But in the midst of 
a global pandemic impacting Americans’ lives 
and livelihoods, cracking down on those 
scams must be a priority. 
One such scam was thwarted by Houston 
police and the Harris County District Attorney, 
who made an arrest in February in an inter-
national cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, 
mostly elderly victims out of more than $1 mil-
lion. 
This bill is aimed at cracking down on these 
scams by bringing public and private stake-
holders together, so that we might give our 
seniors the resources they need to tackle 
these predatory schemes. 
Although 1 in 20 seniors in the U.S. is a tar-
get of fraud schemes, the National Adult Pro-
tective Services Association has found that 
only 1 in 44 seniors report that they are vic-
tims of a fraud scheme. 
The Senior Fraud Advisory Office will ad-
dress these low reportingrates by directing the 
FTC to educate seniors, families, and care-
givers of the process for contacting law en-
forcement after being targeted in a fraud 
scheme. 
It will also direct the FTC to help improve 
the nation’s fraud response efforts by reform-
ing FTC’s complaint system as well as en-
hancing fraud surveillance through better co-
ordination with law enforcement agencies. 
The Senior Scams Prevention Advisory 
Group will bring together relevant government 
agencies, consumer advocates, and industry 
representatives to collect and develop model 
educational materials for retailers, financial in-
stitutions, and wire transfer companies to use 
in preventing scams on seniors. 
The FTC will coordinate efforts to educate 
the public and even the employees of key in-
dustries who often find themselves on the 
front lines of anti-scamming activities, helping 
prevent fraud before it happens. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to strengthen federal 
prevention efforts and ensure leaders in the 
public and private sectors are collaborating on 
effective safeguards. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 1215, the Fraud and Scam Reduc-
tion Act, which is critical to protecting seniors’ 
hard-earned savings and stopping fraudulent 
schemes before it’s too late.

504 MODERNIZATION AND SMALL 
MANUFACTURER ENHANCEMENT 
ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 1490, the ‘‘504 Moderniza-
tion and Small Manufacturer Enhancement 
Act,’’ which modifies the Small Business Ad-
ministration (SBA) 504 Loan Program an op-
portunity to modernize and expand. 
The SBA 504 Loan Program allows small 
businesses to access SBA financing through a 
certified development company (CDC) for ex-
pansion or modernization. 
Specifically, the bill adds policy goals, at 
least one of which a CDC must demonstrate

These include: enhancing the ability of a 
small business to reduce costs by using en-
ergy efficient products and generating renew-
able energy, and aiding the revitalization of 
any area for which a disaster has been de-
clared or determined. The bill also authorizes 
a CDC to take specified actions to facilitate 
the closing of a 504 loan, such as correcting 
borrower or lender information on loan docu-
ments or reallocating up to 10 percent of the 
cost of a project. 
The birth of modern manufacturing can be 
traced to the early 1780s, when American in-
ventor Oliver Evans began experimenting with 
the first automated flour mill. 
He developed the concept of continuous 
process milling, which relied on five so-called 
bulk material handling devices. 
His machines and processes soon caught 
on across the country because they reduced 
manpower by 25 percent while increasing out-
put—the era of automation had begun. 
Today, small manufacturers are making new 
products that provide the best opportunities to 
ignite startups or help existing manufactures 
find new markets. 
This bill increases the maximum loan 
amount from $5.5 million to $6.5 million, re-
duces the amount that they must contribute to 
project costs, increases job retention require-
ments, and revises collateral requirements and 
debt refinancing considerations. 
Further, each SBA district office must part-
ner with a resource partner to provide certain 
training for small manufacturers. 
One of President Biden’s first acts after be-
coming President was to sign an Executive 
Order to support manufacturers, businesses, 
and workers to ensure that our future is made 
in all of America by all of America’s workers. 
President Biden’s Executive Order ensures 
that when the federal government spends tax-
payer dollars, they are spent on American 
made goods by American workers and with 
American-made component parts. 
This 
Executive 
Order 
fulfills 
President 
Biden’s promise to make Buy American real 
and close loopholes that allow companies to 
offshore production and jobs while still quali-
fying for domestic preferences. 
This bill is making it possible for President 
Biden’s executive action to be fulfilled. 
We need to support small manufacturers to 
produce what we need right here in the United 
States. 
The COVID–19 pandemic was a lesson we 
should not forget, when the nation did not 
have enough personal protective equipment in 
the form of masks, gloves or face shields to 
protect health care workers or citizens from 
COVID–19. 
It was essential that our nation never again 
be so ill prepared to weather a crisis like 
COVID–19. 
Manufacturing creates good jobs for low and 
highly skilled workers across the nation. 
In 2018, manufacturers in the United States 
accounted for 11.39 percent of the total output 
in the economy, employing 8.51 percent of the 
workforce. 
Total 
output 
from 
manufacturing 
was 
$2,334.60 billion in 2018. 
In addition, there were an average of 12.8 
million manufacturing employees in the United 
States in 2018, with an average annual com-
pensation of $84,832.13 in 2017. 
We can make sure that Made in America 
means made in the thousands of towns and 
communities across the nation where people 
live, and work today.
