PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, You are good and Your love 
is eternal. From generation to genera-
tion, You have revealed Your faithful-
ness. 
As we pause to reflect on those who 
have gone before us, who have sat in 
this very Chamber, and spoken from 
the same rostrum, remind us again how 
Your provisions for us from year to 
year are never failing. 
As the Nation finds itself at odds 
over countless issues, overwhelmed by 
constant change, and struggling to find 
consensus over numerous concerns, re-
mind us again that discord is not new 
and unrest is not foreign to the Amer-
ican experiment. Then reassure us that 
Your faithfulness endures throughout 
time. 
Cause us once again to remember 
that You call us to give You our whole 
heart, mind, and body, and to believe 
that our days past, present, and future 
are all in Your keeping. Then may we 
not be inclined to lean on our own un-
derstanding in these days or ever, but 
to trust only in You. For You, O Lord, 
are good, and Your love for us is eter-
nal. 
In Your merciful name, we pray. 
Amen.

bow to Your will and live lives devoted 
to Your providential leading. 
Lord, bless our Senators in their 
work. Let faith, hope, and love abound

mind them that they will be judged by 
their fruits and that You require them

We pray in the Name of Him who is

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
since the Senate was last in session, 
our Nation’s highest Court finished its 
term. It was an absolutely historic se-
ries of victories for the American peo-
ple and for the Constitution—the single 
best Supreme Court term in nearly 70 
years, since Brown v. Board overturned 
Plessy in 1954. 
For the first time in modern history, 
there is a textualist and originalist 
majority on the Court—Justices who 
understand the job of a judge is to fol-
low the law as it is written, who under-
stand they are there to faithfully apply 
what our statutes and our Constitution 
actually say and leave everything else 
to the people and their elected rep-
resentatives. This is the kind of judici-
ary that the rule of law requires, that 
our system of government demands, 
that a diverse society needs. 
Last month, the Court corrected one 
of the most egregious legal and moral 
mistakes of the 20th century. Only 
seven countries in the entire world 
allow elective abortion-on-demand past 
20 weeks, but until 2 weeks ago, past 
Supreme Courts had mistakenly de-
creed that the Constitution forced 
America to be one of them. All 50 
States had to handle this issue like 
China and North Korea. No State was 
allowed to handle it even like France 
or Germany. 
Of course, there is no command like 
that in our Constitution, and that is 
what the Court finally recognized. 
There is nothing in the Constitution 
that forces us to be a radical, global 
outlier on abortion. The American peo-
ple finally have their freedom back to 
enact commonsense protections for un-
born life. 
Millions of Americans spent nearly 
half a century working, marching, and 
praying for this landmark day. It has 
been an honor to stand with them 
throughout the journey that led to 
June 24, 2022, and to continue to stand 
together. The Court’s ruling in Dobbs 
is not only a huge victory for innocent 
life, it is a historic triumph for the rule 
of law itself. 
Even liberal legal experts, including 
the late Justice Ginsburg, said the 
Court’s abortion precedents were badly 
reasoned. 
Liberal Yale law professor Akhil 
Amar, just this May, wrote: 
I am a Democrat who supports abortion 
rights but opposes Roe . . . In the eyes of 
many constitutional experts across the ideo-
logical spectrum, it [lacked] solid grounding 
in the Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3188 
July 11, 2022 
Now, Washington Democrats have 
taken pains to ignore that. Remember, 
their party has become jaw-droppingly 
extreme on this issue. More than 60 
percent of Americans support restric-
tions after 15 weeks. Only 19 percent of 
Americans want abortion on demand 
until the moment of birth, but 97 per-
cent of Washington Democrats support 
precisely that; 97 percent of Wash-
ington Democrats are with less than 
one-fifth of the country on this issue. 
So Democrats are desperate to change 
the subject. Many are not even trying 
to argue with the decision but have 
pivoted to claims about all kinds of un-
related issues, but this is nonsense. 
Here again is Professor Amar, the 
arch-liberal from Yale Law, writing, 
again, back in May: 
Does Justice Alito’s draft, as many are 
now claiming, inflict collateral damage on 
other areas of constitutional case law, such 
as the Warren Court’s precedents on contra-
ception and interracial marriage? It does 
not. In fact, the Dobbs draft reinforces these 
iconic opinions by explaining why they were 
[actually] right. 
From top to bottom, this ruling was 
a gigantic step forward for human dig-
nity and for the rule of law. The Jus-
tices tuned out the mobs and at-
tempted 
violence, 
tuned 
out 
the 
threats from politicians, and simply 
followed the law where it clearly led. 
This historic achievement was just 
one part of the most consequential Su-
preme Court term in seven decades. I 
will have more to say on this subject 
this week. 
INFLATION 
Now, Madam President, on an en-
tirely different matter, ‘‘people have 
literally become poorer, by any con-
cept, over the last year . . . It should 
not be a mystery why people are wor-
ried.’’ 
That was top liberal economist Jason 
Furman last month, and he was right 
on both counts. 
Democrats’ 
reckless 
inflationary 
spending has already slapped what 
amounts to a gigantic tax hike on 
working American families. One recent 
poll found more than 90 percent of 
Americans said they are concerned 
about inflation; 70 percent said they 
are very concerned. Consumer con-
fidence was at a near decade low, and 
fewer than one in three Americans ap-
proves of what President Biden is doing 
about it. 
But, apparently, when Washington 
Democrats survey this dismal scene, 
they see a mandate for yet another 
massive trillion-dollar tax hike. I am 
not making this up. Democrats created 
a runaway inflationary tax hike with 
their reckless spending last year, 2021, 
and now they want to come after the 
American people a second time with a 
huge, new tax hike. 
In other words, Democrats have al-
ready picked the American people’s 
pockets once, and now their solution is 
to pick your pockets a second time— 
first with inflation and now with tax 
hikes. 
The policies that are being floated 
are ruinous—the worst possible mix to 
thrust onto a country that is already 
teetering on the brink of recession. We 
are hearing proposals for a gigantic tax 
hike on small businesses, so-called 
passthroughs. Well, one think tank has 
found that about 95 percent of all 
American businesses are passthroughs. 
About three-quarters of all of the 
small-scale employers in the Nation 
are categorized this way: 95 percent of 
American businesses are passthroughs. 
This would hammer all kinds of 
States. Just to pick one, for example, 
nearly half of all of the employment in 
the entire State of West Virginia is at 
passthrough firms. Half of the people 
working in West Virginia work for 
passthrough firms—half of all of the 
jobs in the State of West Virginia. And 
these are the firms that Democrats 
want to hammer with gigantic tax 
hikes? 
But the bad ideas don’t stop there. 
Exactly as the war in Europe is re-
teaching Americans and our allies 
about energy independence, Democrats 
are floating a giant, new tax specifi-
cally on natural gas, which they call a 
methane fee. One analysis has found 
this one policy would bleed between $40 
and $66 billion out of our country every 
year, and you had better believe that 
these artificially higher energy costs 
will get passed right along to con-
sumers. 
This is what Democrats want to do in 
States like West Virginia—giant tax 
hikes on small businesses and fossil 
fuels? It is like they are not content 
watching 
the 
recessionary 
warning 
signs and are trying to make abso-
lutely sure that we get a recession—a 
recession—on their watch. 
Now, it is not as though there is any 
shortage of real, important work Con-
gress could and should be tackling on a 
bipartisan basis instead of these awful 
ideas, but this party-line scheming is 
going to crowd that out. 
For 
example, 
Democrats 
moving 
ahead and trying to jam the Senate 
and the country with a party-line tax 
hike through reconciliation will cer-
tainly crowd out our ability to process 
the bipartisan USICA bill aimed at 
competing with China. Our side cannot 
agree to frantically steamroll through 
delicate bipartisan talks in order to 
meet an artificial timeline so our 
Democratic colleagues can clear the 
decks to ram through a party-line tax 
hike. 
A business owner couldn’t bargain in 
good faith with a customer who had al-
ready announced he plans to rob the 
store. We can’t negotiate the finer 
points of a nuanced economic policy in 
a bipartisan way only for Democrats to 
immediately turn around and redesign 
the entire economy along pure party 
lines. Of course, that can’t work. And 
what about the other governing prior-
ities that Democrats are neglecting? 
What about the National Defense Au-
thorization Act? The House is advanc-
ing their version of this important leg-
islation this week. Will Senate Demo-
crats neglect the NDAA like they did 
last year? That would say a lot about 
their actual resolve to compete with 
China. 
Now is a terrible, terrible time to 
paralyze the Senate by trying to tax us 
into recession on a partisan basis. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is 
little wonder that the Senator from 
Kentucky is praising the Supreme 
Court. More than any other Member of 
the U.S. Senate, he has been instru-
mental in choosing the members of this 
Court and has gone to lengths unseen 
in the history of the U.S. Senate to 
reach that goal. 
Remember 
Merrick 
Garland, 
the 
nominee of President Barack Obama, 
whom this Senate leader, the Senator 
from Kentucky, refused to meet with 
or even consider for his nomination for 
almost a year? That is right—he kept a 
vacancy on the Supreme Court for 
more than 8 months so that he could 
perhaps see his prayers answered and a 
Republican President be elected. 
Well, it happened. Donald Trump 
won. Merrick Garland had no chance to 
even be considered. Barack Obama was 
denied the authority given to him as 
President during his last year of his 
term, and the Senator from Kentucky 
waited patiently until he could bring 
to the Court Justice Gorsuch, a con-
servative to his liking. 
That wasn’t the end of his effort to 
make the Supreme Court what he 
wanted it to be. At the end of the 
Trump term, there was another va-
cancy on the Court with the death of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and at that 
point, the Senator from Kentucky de-
cided to break the rules in the opposite 
direction. It wasn’t a slowdown this 
time in filling the vacancy; it was an 
acceleration, a speedup. In that in-
stance, they broke most of the prece-
dents in the Senate in terms of consid-
ering Supreme Court nominees for 
Amy Coney Barrett. So 
President 
Trump was able, thanks to the com-
plicity of the Senator from Kentucky, 
to appoint three members of the Su-
preme Court. 
The rulings in the last several weeks 
are just what the Senator from Ken-
tucky and others have prayed for: a re-
versal of the rights of American fami-
lies across the board. Basically, the 
right to access to reproductive freedom 
for women in this country was at-
tacked in a way that few thought 
would ever happen, and now we are liv-
ing with the consequences. 
The Senator from Kentucky just said 
Democrats are trying to change the 
subject. I am not changing the subject. 
There will be a hearing before the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee tomorrow on 
this decision by the Supreme Court on 
overturning Roe v. Wade. 
I want to say it is interesting that 
when the Senator from Kentucky is

looking for moral and academic sup-
port, he turns to an unheard-of pro-
fessor from Yale to quote. He uses that 
professor as a source to say: Don’t 
worry. Just because we took away the 
freedom of women when it comes to 
their reproductive health, we are not 
going to go so far as to address any de-
cisions on contraception, family plan-
ning, and the like. 
Well, I might recommend to the Sen-
ator from Kentucky that he read the 
decision in Dobbs overturning Roe v. 
Wade and the concurring opinion from 
Justice Clarence Thomas, which said 
specifically that very thing. Now, he 
said, that we have done Roe v. Wade, it 
is time to look at cases that address 
the issue of privacy, the issue of same- 
sex marriage, and the issues of contra-
ception, explicitly using those words. 
So to suggest that some Yale pro-
fessor should be trusted more than this 
Justice on the Court who has given us 
fair warning is hard to understand. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
Madam President, there is also this 
talk about the Democrats in favor of a 
tax hike. Let me put this in perspec-
tive. The Democrats are trying to 
achieve something that the vast major-
ity of the American people want des-
perately: Find a way to control the spi-
raling cost of prescription drugs. 
I can’t think of a single issue more 
popular with the American people— 
Democrats, Republicans, and Independ-
ents—and so the Senators have been 
working on it. Senator SHAHEEN, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, Senator MANCHIN, and 
others have been discussing ways to re-
duce the cost of insulin to no more 
than $35 a month. Wouldn’t that be a 
break for the millions of diabetic 
Americans who many times have to cut 
the amount of insulin that they use be-
cause they can’t afford it, to have af-
fordable, 
lifesaving 
medicine? 
Isn’t 
that something we all should applaud? 
And doesn’t it reduce costs overall for 
us to bring down the spiraling cost of 
prescription drugs? 
The Senator from Kentucky talks a 
lot about the cost American families 
are facing. We know that is a fact. One 
of the first things they will identify is 
the cost of prescription drugs. We want 
to do something about it. The Senator 
from Kentucky has said no, he won’t 
support this effort to corral in these 
costs of prescription drugs as long as 
there is an increase in taxes. 
It turns out the increase in taxes 
were the Trump tax cuts for the 
wealthiest people in America. Yes, I 
think they ought to pay more in taxes, 
and if their paying more in taxes 
means that families pay less for pre-
scription drugs, sign me up for it, and 
sign most Americans up for it. The no-
tion of tax hikes on the wealthiest peo-
ple in this country does not strike me 
as inflationary; it strikes me as com-
mon sense if it is then turning into 
lower 
prescription 
drug 
prices 
for 
American families. 
HIGHLAND PARK SHOOTING 
Madam President, on June 8, 15 days 
after their 10-year-old daughter Lexi 
was murdered—murdered—at Robb Ele-
mentary School in Uvalde, TX, Kim-
berly and Felix Rubio testified before 
the House Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. 
In their testimony, Kimberly and 
Felix recalled the last time they ever 
saw their daughter. There was a school 
assembly. Lexi had received a Good 
Citizen Award and had been recognized 
for receiving straight A’s. The family 
said: We are going to celebrate tonight. 
We are going to take the whole family 
out for ice cream, her parents told her. 
She was overjoyed. Then they said 
goodbye and sent her off to the class-
room. 
Less than an hour later, in Uvalde, 
TX, an 18-year-old man armed with a 
military-style assault rifle stormed 
into Lexi’s fourth grade classroom and 
shot and killed her and 18 of her class-
mates, along with 2 teachers who tried 
their best to protect the kids. It was 
the deadliest school shooting in Amer-
ica in the decade since Sandy Hook in 
Connecticut. 
In her remarks to Congress, Lexi’s 
mom Kimberly issued a prophetic 
warning. She said: 
There’s a mom listening to our testimony 
thinking, ‘‘I can’t even imagine [the pain of 
this family]’’—not knowing that our pain 
will one day be [her pain], unless we [do 
something] now. 
That happened before our Fourth of 
July break, and I will have to tell you 
that there was an occurrence during 
that break, which I will never forget. 
If I had to choose one town to take 
one of my kids or grandkids to for a 
Fourth of July parade, it would be 
Highland Park, IL. What a great little 
town it is. People really care in that 
town, and they care for one another. It 
is a beautiful little suburban commu-
nity in Chicago. I happen to know the 
mayor, Nancy Rotering, personally, 
and I know how hard she works to 
make that a great town to live in. 
Fourth of July was the day for their 
parade, and, as usual, thousands came 
out, carrying little American flags, 
proud of their country, wanting to cel-
ebrate not just America but Highland 
Park, that great community. Unfortu-
nately, 1 week ago today, a young man 
armed with a military-style assault 
rifle climbed onto the roof of a building 
in Highland Park, IL, and, from his 
sniper’s perch, opened fire on families 
gathered to watch the Fourth of July 
parade. Listen closely. He fired more 
than 80 rounds in less than a minute— 
80 rounds in less than a minute. He 
killed seven people and injured dozens 
more. 
I called the mayor of Highland Park 
a couple hours after this happened. I 
was in Michigan on a family vacation 
and was on my way as quickly as I 
could drive back to Highland Park in 
my home State. 
I reached Mayor Nancy Rotering and 
said: Can you tell me anything? 
She said: It is horrible. It is terrible. 
We are still looking to find the shooter. 
Can you imagine, she said they found 
a 2-year-old toddler wandering about, 
covered in blood. Fortunately, that 
toddler, the little boy, hadn’t been 
shot, but they were circulating photos 
of his face in the hopes that they could 
identify family members. They figured 
the worse—that little boy would be out 
alone because he had lost his parents. 
Kevin 
and 
Irina 
McCarthy 
were 
among those victims on the Fourth of 
July. They went to the parade with 
that 2-year-old boy, whose name is 
Aiden. When the shooting started, 
Kevin placed his body over Aiden to 
protect him. He died protecting his 
son. His son’s mother died right next to 
him. 
Another parade-goer saw Aiden, his 
little legs smeared with his father’s 
blood, and carried him to safety. The 
poor little boy could not even say his 
full name. They started searching for 
relatives and family. Aiden is now with 
his grandparents. He lost both his mom 
and dad at that parade. 
Jacki Sundheim was a beloved pre-
school teacher at North Shore Con-
gregation Israel. You should see the 
outpouring of letters talking about 
these people whose names I have men-
tioned here, how beloved they were in 
their community. Jacki was one of 
them. 
Katie Goldstein went to the parade 
with her daughter Cassie. When the 
shooting started, Katie and her daugh-
ter starting running, but Katie was 
shot in the chest and fell. Cassie said 
she leaned over her dying mother and 
told her she loved her, but she couldn’t 
stop running because the gunman was 
still shooting. 
Stephen Strauss, what a story—a fi-
nancial adviser who still worked full 
time at the age of 88 because he loved 
his work, and he loved life. He used to 
take the train in from Highland Park 
to downtown Chicago every single day. 
He and his wife Linda were 2 months 
shy of their 60th wedding anniversary. 
Nicolas 
Toledo-Zaragosa 
came 
to 
Highland Park 2 years ago from Mexico 
to visit his family. He was in a wheel-
chair following a recent accident. He 
was shot in the chest and killed in that 
same wheelchair. 
Eduardo Uvaldo was a father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather. He and 
his wife had just celebrated their 50th 
anniversary. The Fourth of July was 
Eduardo’s favorite holiday. He couldn’t 
wait to go to the parade. He was shot 
in the back of the head and died 2 days 
later in the hospital. 
Now there is an additional story I 
want you to hear. It is about this little 
boy. Cooper Roberts was among the 46 
parade-goers who were injured. He 
went to the parade with his twin broth-
er Luke and his mom and dad. He is 8 
years old. He loves playing baseball 
and soccer. His brother Luke suffered 
shrapnel wounds in his arm, and his 
mom Keely was shot in her leg and in 
her foot. 
I want to read from an article in the 
Chicago Sun-Times that was printed 
just within the last 2 days to tell you 
what has happened to this little boy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3190 
July 11, 2022 
The bullet that hit [this little boy] Cooper 
Roberts in the mass shooting at Highland 
Park’s Fourth of July parade tore a ‘‘very 
perilous’’ path through his small body. 
You see, the military-assault weapon 
which was used by the shooter is not 
just another gun; it is a military-style 
weapon. Smith & Wesson, which makes 
the weapon, advertised it as an M&P 
weapon. I didn’t know what that 
meant. Now I do—military and police 
weapon. The bullets that leave that 
gun, shot from that gun, travel at two 
to three times the velocity of an ordi-
nary gun. When they hit the human 
body, they don’t just pass through it; 
they shred the organs in the body on 
the way out the other side. 
For poor little Cooper who was shot: 
[I]t caught his liver and esophagus, severed 
his spinal cord and caused so much internal 
bleeding that doctors had to take extraor-
dinary measures to save his life. 
Despite the horrific injuries, his doctors 
said Sunday that Cooper’s condition has 
been stabilized. He was scheduled for more 
surgery Monday at the University of Chi-
cago’s Comer Children’s Hospital. 
The family put out a written state-
ment that said: 
He is in a great deal of pain—physically 
and emotionally—especially as the family 
had to share with him the devastating news 
that he is paralyzed from the waist down. 
Cooper’s twin and ‘‘best friend’’ Luke also 
was wounded, struck by shrapnel in his leg. 
Their mother, Keely Roberts, was injured as 
well. 
Seven people were killed and dozens were 
injured. . . . The bullet that struck Cooper 
entered his upper abdomen, just below his di-
aphragm, ‘‘not his chest as originally be-
lieved,’’ according to the doctors, who said it 
damaged the left side of his liver, his esoph-
agus and his abdominal aorta. That last in-
jury— 
To his aorta— 
was so bad that the doctors had to replace a 
section of the large blood vessel with a ‘‘syn-
thetic graft in adult size so he can grow into 
it.’’ 
A hole in his esophagus was sewn closed, 
and the portion of his liver hit by the gun-
shot was repaired. The surgery planned Mon-
day was for more repairs on his esophagus. 
Cooper’s abdomen was temporarily kept 
open with a ‘‘specialized vacuum dressing’’ 
because of the ‘‘severity’’ of his wounds and 
the number of blood transfusions he under-
went, according to his family. 
They said the bullet exited his back, sev-
ering his spinal cord. While he is paralyzed 
from the waist down, [they report he] suf-
fered no brain damage and has experienced 
no effect on his cognitive function. 
He was able to breathe on his own and 
speak by Friday after being kept on a venti-
lator for four days. He remains in serious 
condition. 
‘‘The family wishes to acknowledge and 
thank the many, many people—emergency 
medics, police, fire department, nurses and 
doctors and both hospitals—who did’’ [such 
extraordinary work]. 
I read the details of this because I 
want those who are following this de-
bate to hear them and take a look at 
this. 
What did he do wrong? He went to 
the Fourth of July parade with his 
mom and dad. I am sure he was as 
happy as you see him in this picture. 
And because a man with a military- 
style rifle went berserk and fired on his 
family, his life has changed forever. 
Why? Why do we put up with this in 
this country? This break—Fourth of 
July break—will always be remem-
bered by me as not just another recess 
from the Senate but a moment when 
my State was under attack from the 
madness that we have in this country 
when it comes to weapons under the 
Second Amendment. 
The Senator from Kentucky said ear-
lier we need originalists, we need 
textualists in the U.S. Senate. The Pre-
siding Officer has heard that many 
times. 
Stick with the words of the Constitu-
tion. Just go back and find out what 
they meant. Let me read the Second 
Amendment so there is no question 
what it says: 
A well regulated Militia, being necessary 
to the security of a free State, the right of 
the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not 
be infringed. 
Do you think, in their wildest imagi-
nation, the Founding Fathers con-
ceived of a weapon that could fire off 90 
rounds in less than a minute? At a 
time when you are dealing with mus-
kets and it took minutes to load the 
musket even if you were skilled, do you 
think they even had that in a concept 
they could imagine? I don’t. 
Originalism? Keep and bear arms? 
How did it come to the point now 
where that has been a rationalization 
for the sale of a military assault weap-
on? AR–15s are the generic class of 
these weapons, these military assault 
weapons. I set out on a journey to fig-
ure out just how many there were in 
America. I started asking. The honest 
answer is people don’t know. Some-
where between 10 and 20 million—10 
and 20 million military assault weap-
ons already sold in America. The total 
number of firearms in this country: 400 
million for a nation of 350 million peo-
ple, more than 1 firearm for every liv-
ing American. That is the point we 
have reached. 
And if you want the right to bear a 
firearm for sport or hunting purposes, 
count me as supporting that effort. It 
is a tradition in my family in the Mid-
west and many, but I can tell you this; 
it is a tradition which was treated 
very, very sensibly. Guns—and they 
were possessed by most members of my 
family—were always under lock and 
key for fear that a child could get their 
hands on it. 
What is happening now when these 
young people below the age of 21 are 
turning around and buying these weap-
ons? 
And let’s take a look at what the in-
dustry is doing with these weapons be-
cause it tells us the story of what is 
happening. According to the Gun Vio-
lence Archive, the Highland Park pa-
rade shooting was the 309th mass 
shooting this year in America—309 al-
ready in 27 weeks, more than 11 mass 
shootings each week, more than 1 a 
day. 
What is a mass shooting? When four 
people are injured or killed by gunfire. 
And while mass shootings get the most 
headlines, they are far from the only 
shootings in America. At least 220 peo-
ple were killed and close to 570 others 
were injured in shootings over the 
Fourth of July weekend, according to 
the Gun Violence Archive. 
We have come to accept this as the 
reality of life in America. Other coun-
tries look at us and shake their heads: 
How can these great Americans, as 
smart as they are, let this situation 
spin out of control? 
Thirty miles south of Highland Park 
on the Fourth of July in the city of 
Chicago, 10 people were killed, 62 in-
jured by gun violence over that week-
end. 
Now, the new bipartisan gun law, 
which the President highlighted today 
at the White House, passed last month. 
It didn’t go as far as many of us liked, 
but it will save lives. And it certainly 
doesn’t violate any aspect of the Sec-
ond Amendment. It is the most signifi-
cant gun law we have considered and 
passed in 30 years. 
So what do you think if I ask you the 
question: What are the symbols of 
American freedom and independence? 
What would you say? Oh, the Declara-
tion of Independence? I agree. The Con-
stitution and Bill of Rights? Certainly. 
The Emancipation Proclamation? I 
might include that. Fireworks and a 
Fourth of July parade? 
Well, let me show you what the mar-
keting giants in the shooting industry 
have identified: 
‘‘Engineered to the specs of freedom 
and independence.’’ 
The MMR tactical rifle, part of the 
same class of weapons used by the kill-
er in Highland Park—this is what one 
gun manufacturer, Mossberg, wants 
you to believe is the epitome of Amer-
ican freedom and independence. This is 
an actual ad for an AR–15-style semi-
automatic assault rifle shown here. 
And, incidentally, it has a high-capac-
ity magazine. 
The shooter in Highland Park had 
three of these high-capacity magazines 
and was able to fire 90 rounds because 
of it. Take a look at this advertisement 
from the same industry telling civil-
ians, ‘‘Use what they use’’—use the 
same guns that soldiers and marines 
use in combat but use them, sadly, in 
towns like Highland Park, IL, and 
Uvalde, TX. 
This ad is from a company called 
Daniel Defense. One of their semiauto-
matic assault rifles was used to murder 
those 19 children in Uvalde, TX. Daniel 
Defense semiautomatic assault rifles 
were also found in the room of the kill-
er 
who 
murdered—murdered—60 
concertgoers and injured more than 400 
others at the Harvest Music Festival in 
Las Vegas in 2017, the worst mass 
shooting in the history of the United 
States. But, with pride, they advertise 
these weapons. 
These kinds of reckless ads for as-
sault weapons didn’t exist 30 years ago. 
That 
is 
when 
gun 
manufacturers 
looked into the future and saw a prob-
lem. They realized that Americans

weren’t going out hunting like they 
used to or even sport shooting. So they 
had to create a new craving, a new ap-
petite for a weapon. They needed to at-
tract a new customer to new sorts of 
weapons. So they created ads like 
these, equating freedom and independ-
ence with these little killing machines. 
It gets worse. Here is an ad for a new 
assault rifle that came out this year. 
The AR–15 is the weapon of choice, as I 
mentioned, for mass shootings. This is 
an ad for a JR–15, a junior AR–15. It is 
manufactured by Wee 1 Tactical. I am 
sorry to say it is an Illinois company. 
It is like an AR–15, but it is designed 
for kids—20 percent smaller and light-
er. It is designed for children under the 
age of 18. 
Look at the logos in this ad and look 
closely. They are the same logos that 
are imprinted on the weapon. They 
show these skulls of children with pac-
ifiers in their mouths. You will find 
that same symbol on the gun that they 
sell. 
Today, the tobacco companies are 
creating vaping products with flavors 
like cotton candy and gummy bears to 
hook kids on nicotine. This gun manu-
facturer uses cartoon skulls sucking on 
pacifiers to try to hook children on 
using military-style assault weapons. 
Those weapons belong not at towns 
like Highland Park but on the battle-
field—not in our communities and cer-
tainly not in the hands of children. 
Current Federal law affords the fire-
arms industry broad and unjustifiable 
immunity from civil liability. What 
would you think if a major automobile 
manufacturer sold a car in this country 
and the brakes did not work? Should 
they be held liable? Few would ques-
tion that. But if a gun manufacturer 
makes a gun that is inherently dan-
gerous or negligently manufactured, 
that is dangerous in and of itself, the 
gun industry has bought immunity in 
the law at the Federal level so they 
cannot be sued for that dangerous 
product. Dangerous car? The manufac-
turer can be sued. Dangerous gun? No 
liability. 
Current Federal law allows the fire-
arm industry broad and unjustifiable 
immunity from civil liability, but that 
immunity is not unlimited. Firearms 
manufacturers do not have a license to 
recklessly peddle high-powered killing 
machines to those who should not have 
them. They should be held accountable, 
and, believe me, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee is going to look at that 
law. 
These assault rifles, these weapons of 
war, are killing our kids and threat-
ening our communities in Buffalo, 
Uvalde, Highland Park, and so many 
other places. The death tolls and the 
tragedies will continue to multiply 
until we act. 
Madam President, I will close by say-
ing today I saw our Governor, JB 
Pritzker, who came to the ceremony at 
the White House, together with Nancy 
Rotering, the mayor of Highland Park. 
I want to commend both of them for 
their leadership, and I want to thank 
the first responders. One week ago, the 
night of the shooting, I finally made it 
to Highland Park and went through 
and thanked all of the first respond-
ers—the ATF agents who so quickly 
identified this rifle as belonging to the 
man who was ultimately charged. I say 
to my colleagues: Let’s waste no time 
and put a director at ATF. We need 
him now more than ever. 
And to all those who responded, gave 
up their Fourth of July and did what 
they were asked to do so many times, 
risked their own lives for the safety of 
others, our heartfelt thanks. We owe 
them everything. From the medical 
crews who turned around on an emer-
gency basis and did such miraculous 
things for all the people who were in-
jured, our thanks are there and will be 
forever. 
But now it is our turn not just to 
praise those who showed courage but to 
show courage ourselves. Can we sum-
mon the courage to put an end to these 
military assault rifles and say that 
this is not part of any Second Amend-
ment right in America; that these are 
killing weapons? Sadly, we have too 
many lost lives to show for it. 
I will close with Cooper’s picture 
again. This perfect little boy—8 years 
old—went to the Fourth of July parade 
to celebrate our country and be with 
his family, and his life will never be 
the same. 
What are we going to do about it? 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Iowa. 
HUNTER BIDEN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
on May 9 of this year, Senator JOHNSON 
and I wrote to David Weiss, the U.S. at-
torney for the District of Delaware. 
Now, he happens to be in charge of the 
Hunter Biden criminal case. In that 
letter, we asked Mr. Weiss a series of 
threshold questions that Attorney Gen-
eral Garland has repeatedly failed to 
answer. 
First, we asked whether Nicholas 
McQuaid is recused from the Hunter 
Biden case. As we have said publicly 
many times, McQuaid is conflicted be-
cause he worked with Hunter Biden’s 
criminal attorney before he was hired 
as a top position in President Biden’s 
Justice Department. 
Second, we asked Mr. Weiss whether 
he or any of his employees have had 
any communications with McQuaid. 
Third, we asked Mr. Weiss whether 
any of his employees, not just Mr. 
McQuaid, are recused from the Hunter 
Biden case. 
We asked these questions because the 
Biden family is from Delaware and has 
extensive political connections. Nota-
bly, Hunter Biden told his business 
partners: 
I’ll bring suit in the Chancery Court in 
Delaware—which as you know is my home 
state and I’m privileged to have worked with 
and know every judge in the Chancery Court. 
Does the Biden family have connec-
tions to anyone in Mr. Weiss’s office? 
That seems to be a very fair question. 
With respect to those three ques-
tions, Mr. Weiss didn’t even try to an-
swer. In fact, the Attorney General 
jumped in and answered on behalf of 
U.S. Attorney Weiss. But calling the 
Attorney General’s letter an answer is 
an overstatement. It was another non-
answer—essentially just words on a 
piece of paper that didn’t say anything 
worthwhile. 
So Senator JOHNSON and I also asked 
Mr. Weiss if he has received sufficient 
resources and support from the Justice 
Department to properly handle the 
Hunter Biden case. 
Again, no answers. 
One would think that the Depart-
ment, and specifically Mr. Weiss, would 
want to tell Congress and the Amer-
ican public that the answer to that 
question is yes. The failure of Mr. 
Weiss to answer that very important 
question adds to the growing concern 
and public concern that the Justice De-
partment is pulling the punches on the 
Hunter Biden case. 
We also asked Mr. Weiss whether he 
has discussed the need for a special 
counsel or an independent counsel to 
properly investigate the Hunter Biden 
case. 
Again, no answer. 
The last question is more relevant 
today than when it was asked because 
the other week a voicemail was re-
leased reportedly from Joe Biden to 
Hunter Biden. In it, Joe Biden repeat-
edly left a message about a New York 
Times article that involved Hunter 
Biden’s dealings with Ye Jianming. 
That business associate is closely con-
nected to the communist Chinese re-
gime. 
Joe Biden told his son: ‘‘I think 
you’re clear.’’ 
Well, that message appears to show 
that Joe Biden was aware of Hunter 
Biden’s business deals and relation-
ships. So the White House strategy for 
the President to continue to deny 
knowledge of these business relation-
ships falls very flat. 
On July 30, 2021, and on June 28, 2022, 
Senator JOHNSON and I wrote to the 
White House counsel. We wrote about 
then-Vice President Biden’s use of non-
government email to transmit govern-
ment information to Hunter Biden. The 
White House counsel’s office refuses to 
answer whether President Biden still 
communicates government business to 
Hunter Biden, among other questions 
that we posed. 
So 
what 
do 
we 
get? 
More 
stonewalling. 
Most recently, on July 7, this year, 
Senator JOHNSON and I wrote to the At-
torney General, FBI Director, and U.S. 
Attorney Weiss. In our letter, we asked 
again about recusals of Hunter Biden’s 
case. We also noted that recent report-
ing on Hunter Biden showed more con-
nections between him and foreign na-
tionals—this 
time, 
Russians 
and 
Ukrainians. Those additional links fur-
ther support my and Senator JOHNSON’s 
conclusion in our September 2020 Biden 
report that Hunter Biden’s activity 
causes criminal, counterintelligence, 
and extortion concerns. 
At the time, our findings were ig-
nored 
or 
falsely 
labeled 
Russian 
disinformation by Democrats and by 
liberal media. We gave floor speeches 
on March 28, this year, March 29, this 
year, April 5, that introduced bank 
records connecting Hunter and James 
Biden to the communist Chinese re-
gime. The same connections that we 
made in our 2020 report. Those bank 
records have proven to be authentic 
and, 
hence, 
aren’t 
Russian 
disinformation. 
For years, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle levied com-
plaints against the Trump administra-
tion’s Justice Department for the lack 
of transparency. Now, why aren’t those 
same Democrat colleagues raising this 
concern about this administration not 
showing the proper transparency? 
Congress has a constitutional respon-
sibility to ensure the proper execution 
of, and compliance with, conflicts of 
interest laws and regulations. The fail-
ure of the Justice Department to com-
ply with these rules will cause political 
infection to run rampant. And, of 
course, that will rot the core of the 
Justice Department and cast a cloud 
over everything that the Department 
of Justice does. 
As I have said before, the Justice De-
partment’s failure to be transparent 
with the Hunter Biden criminal case 
and recusals related to it has cast a 
cloud over that investigation. So I ask: 
What is the Justice Department trying 
to hide? 
The American people’s concern about 
how the case has been managed, these 
concerns are very legitimate. 
To Attorney General Garland, to 
Wray, and to Mr. Weiss, I strongly urge 
you to clear the cloud sooner rather 
than later. 
HIGHLAND PARK SHOOTING 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I want to say a few words—I sup-
pose too few words—about the tragedy 
that happened at Highland Park on 
July Fourth where seven souls lost 
their lives. On that day, a disturbed 
and troubled young man opened fire 
from a rooftop at crowds below who 
were attending that Fourth of July pa-
rade event. 
Like many disturbed men before him, 
there was a long trail of warning signs. 
Police and prosecutors contacted him 
twice in 2019 when he was still a teen, 
including when he attempted suicide. 
We shouldn’t bear to see these predict-
able signs anymore. I ask again this 
Congress to pass my EAGLES Act of 
2021. This bill provides the proper 
training to recognize the signs of a per-
son mobilizing to do violence and then 
give the opportunity to intercede be-
fore these bad acts take place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3193 
July 11, 2022 
There is a pattern to these tragedies, 
and we need to pass the EAGLES Act 
to make sure more people are aware of 
how to identify these young men and 
get them the help they need before we 
have another tragedy. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I had the privilege of spending 
time meeting with Iowa law enforce-
ment during a recent break when the 
Congress was not in session. I met with 
them to hear directly what they are 
facing on the ground. I asked what sup-
port they needed from Congress and 
what challenges these people are fac-
ing. 
Law enforcement faces too many 
problems, and we need to understand 
more how that affects their work and 
their morale. Do you know what I 
heard from these people? That recruit-
ing new officers and retaining their 
current officers is a harder job for the 
chiefs to do than ever. In part, this is 
because young people are being told by 
leaders, even Members of Congress, 
that being in law enforcement is not an 
honorable profession. They are hearing 
that it isn’t a career worth pursuing. 
These Iowa officers asked me to 
speak with my fellow legislators to 
stop that kind of nonsense talk, and 
they happen to be right when they give 
us that advice, that we ought to honor 
the policemen today and law enforce-
ment generally. There is no greater 
love than for a man to lay down his life 
for his community, and that sacrifice 
of personal safety for the well-being of 
others is what law enforcement em-
bodies every day. 
Recruiting and retaining good offi-
cers is also hard because of the in-
crease in ambush attacks on law en-
forcement. Not only are citizens much 
less cooperative when dealing with law 
enforcement, but some are actually in-
tentionally targeting and murdering 
our law enforcement personnel. Twenty 
twenty-one was the most dangerous 
year to be a law enforcement officer in 
the last two decades. Many officers in 
Iowa aren’t volunteering for overtime 
anymore because it is too dangerous. 
An ambush attack like this happened 
a few weeks ago in Los Angeles. Two 
officers responded to reports of a stab-
bing. When they knocked on the door, 
they were shot and killed by a gang 
member who was out on probation. He 
should have been already in jail, but he 
caught a huge break from progressive 
prosecutors in that city. 
That wasn’t the first time an officer 
was killed by a gang member in Los 
Angeles this year. This type of tragedy 
is getting replayed over and over again 
throughout the country, but we simply 
don’t have good data on gang violence 
and on assaults on law enforcement, so 
we don’t know the exact number of 
gang killings of policemen. 
We need more data, which is why I 
am working on two pieces of legisla-
tion to improve data collection on both 
gang violence and assaults on law en-
forcement. The Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee will have a hearing on attacks 
on police to discuss these issues. I look 
forward to having it during that pe-
riod. I hope my colleagues will stay on 
target and focus on the violence these 
brave men and women face and not use 
this as a forum to chastise police. We 
cannot wait any longer to talk about 
this issue and the effects it is having 
on our communities. 
HONORING SERGEANT JOHN WILLIAMS AND DEP-
UTY SHERIFF AUSTIN ‘‘MELVIN’’ RICHARDSON 
Madam President, while I am ad-
dressing this issue, I have some related 
and tragic news. Once again we in Iowa 
have a heavy heart as I recognize two 
Iowa officers who recently died in the 
line of duty. 
Sergeant 
John 
Williams 
of 
the 
Coralville Police Department died from 
a medical issue while he was on patrol 
July 3. He was described by those who 
knew him as ‘‘an extraordinary officer, 
a friend, and a neighbor’’ and also a 
‘‘fantastic family man and a true pub-
lic servant.’’ He was a fixture in the 
community as a 28-year veteran of the 
force, the longest serving sergeant with 
the Coralville Police Department—a 
department which said that Sergeant 
Williams’ ‘‘knowledge, experience, and 
leadership will be near-impossible to 
replace.’’ 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Austin 
‘‘Melvin’’ 
Richardson perished on June 14 in a 
traffic collision. Deputy Richardson 
was a dedicated public servant in law 
enforcement for 15 years. He was an of-
ficer for Sidney, IA, and then joined 
the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office in 
2015, where he faithfully served since. 
Deputy Richardson truly fulfilled the 
meaning of a public servant. He was 
not only a member of law enforcement 
but also a volunteer firefighter for Per-
cival and Sidney. He was described as a 
‘‘staple’’ in the community, and he will 
be deeply missed. 
Sergeant Williams is survived by his 
wife Kim; his four children: Brandon, 
Benjamin, Sarah, and Rebekah; as well 
as six grandchildren: Noah, Elijah, Elsa 
Adalyn, Kalliope, and Emma. 
Deputy Richardson will be left be-
hind by his wife Jennifer and three 
daughters, 
Bryxtol, 
Cheyenne, 
and 
Everly. 
I say to all of them: Your sacrifice is 
honored and appreciated in your com-
munity and by your country. We thank 
you all. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Madam President, on to my last 
statement, it wasn’t too long ago I 
came to the Senate floor to talk about 
the dangers of bad blue city policies, 
ideas like defunding and degrading the 
police, progressive prosecutors, and 
bail reform. These policies are dan-
gerous for our citizens, our children, 
and our communities. 
Well, a few weeks later, I am up here 
again 
with 
an 
update. 
Americans 
agreed with those statements I have 
made. Americans are concerned about 
the nationwide rise in violent crime, 
and they don’t trust politicians who 
allow crime to continue. I don’t blame 
them, and most Americans don’t blame 
them for being upset. 
New York Governor Kathy Hochul 
was forced to change bail laws to allow 
judges to set bail for more repeat of-
fenders and those accused of gun 
crimes. About 66 percent of the reg-
istered voters in New York overwhelm-
ingly support that change that took 
place in New York. Why wouldn’t they? 
Keeping 
dangerous 
criminals 
away 
from the innocent public makes our 
communities safer, and New Yorkers 
now know that and probably did always 
know it. 
Across the country, in San Francisco 
of all places, another referendum on 
safety happened. Voters there recalled 
their progressive prosecutor, Chesa 
Boudin. Boudin refused to charge or 
prosecute certain violent crimes, like 
felony domestic violence. After only 2 
years on the job, even liberal San Fran-
ciscans rejected his soft-on-crime ap-
proach, and he was fired. Why wouldn’t 
they? Prosecuting dangerous criminals 
for the crimes they commit makes the 
community safer, and San Franciscans 
now know it. 
Nationwide, it looks like Americans 
have cause for hope when it comes to 
violent crime. Compared to last year, 
many cities are a bit safer, but a few 
cities are getting worse, sadly to say. 
Why? Because they are still using the 
bad ideas that Americans are rejecting. 
Homicides in Los Angeles are up 
compared to this time last year. Well, 
they have a progressive prosecutor, 
George Gascon. 
Homicides in Washington, DC, are up. 
Well, we have police defunding to 
thank for that statistic. Now the city 
is trying to play catch-up to fix its 
mistake while their citizens are still in 
danger. 
Homicides in Milwaukee are up. Well, 
they have bad bail reform policies. 
These policies led a dangerous man 
who should have been locked up run his 
car through a parade last year. 
I will spend a few minutes focusing 
on bail reform. 
We know that only a few hundred 
people commit most of the murders in 
any given cities. These criminals get 
arrested an average of 12 times. Most 
Americans know what logic tells us: 
Keeping people who commit crimes off 
the streets increases public safety. It 
seems pretty simple to me. If most 
crimes are committed by a small group 
of individuals who commit crimes over 
and over again and we can keep these 
repeat offenders away from innocent 
people, innocent Americans, then we 
should do just that. The best way to do 
this is through effective bail policies. 
The Federal bail system assesses the 
risk to society posed by the individual 
who is arrested. States would do well 
to mirror the Federal system. 
Americans are paying the price for 
bad policies that they don’t want. It is 
time to stop these terrible, progressive 
blue city ideas to make Americans safe 
again. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3194 
July 11, 2022 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
USICA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, dur-
ing the immediate past recess, the bi-
partisan conference committee nego-
tiations over the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act, otherwise known as 
USICA, have officially come to a 
screeching halt. It has been more than 
a year since the Senate actually passed 
this bill—more than a year. 
Eight months later, House Demo-
crats passed their own partisan bill, 
which looked more like the failed 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda, rather 
than a serious attempt to protect our 
national security by countering the 
Chinese threat. 
And earlier this summer, a con-
ference committee was appointed and 
began negotiating a compromise bill 
that would finally fund the CHIPS Act 
and make other critical investments in 
our national security and competitive-
ness. Of course, the CHIPS Act was de-
signed to try to bring back on shore 
American manufacturing of advanced 
semiconductors, which I will talk more 
about in a moment. 
But with the CHIPS funding on the 
five-yard line, the majority leader, the 
Senator from New York, has tossed a 
grenade into the end zone. 
And why would you possibly jeop-
ardize such an important national se-
curity priority? Apparently, so Demo-
crats can try to, yet again, pass their 
unpopular 
social 
welfare 
bill 
that 
doesn’t even appear to have universal 
Democratic support. Forget the bipar-
tisan bill to safeguard our national se-
curity; forget commonsense safeguards 
to protect our most critical supply 
chains; forget new American manufac-
turing jobs and big investments in 
States all across the country. 
Senator SCHUMER has chosen to re-
vive the ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ bill be-
cause we are just months from an elec-
tion where polls suggest that his party 
is going to get swept out of control and 
then instead of majority leader, he will 
become the minority leader. 
So let’s take a moment to recall how 
we happened to get here. More than 2 
years ago, Congress began working to 
bolster domestic semiconductor manu-
facturing and address a major supply 
chain vulnerability. 
Semiconductors or microcircuits un-
derpin all of the modern technology we 
depend upon every day: the cell phones 
in our pockets, the cars in our drive-
ways, the tractors our farmers drive, 
and missile systems that our troops 
use abroad. 
Chips keep us safe; they keep us con-
nected; and they ensure that we have 
fresh food, clean water, and a way to 
get to work every day. The United 
States relies on strong supplies of 
semiconductors, and we lead the way in 
chip design, but here is the kicker. 
While we lead the way in chip design, 
we outsource the actual manufacturing 
abroad. 
That is right. We manufacture none 
of the world’s most advanced chips— 
zero. 
Seventy-five percent of these chips 
come from East Asia, and a whopping 
90 percent of them are made in Taiwan. 
Given the explicit threat of war by the 
Chinese Communist Party against Tai-
wan, that is a grave cause for concern. 
Furthermore, 
having 
just 
lived 
through a pandemic, consider what an-
other pandemic or natural disaster 
might do to disrupt the supply chain of 
these critical semiconductors. 
And when you consider the fact that 
global chip demand is expected to in-
crease by 56 percent over the next dec-
ade, it is clear that the problem is 
going to get worse. A major disruption 
in our global chip supply would halt 
manufacturing 
on 
everything 
from 
laptop computers to cars, to anti-tank 
Javelin missiles being used in Ukraine 
against Russian aggressors. 
This is a matter of both economic 
and national security, which is why ad-
dressing the chip shortage has been a 
bipartisan priority. In 2020, 96 Senators 
supported passing the CHIPS for Amer-
ica Act as part of the national defense 
authorization bill. That was way back 
in 2020. 
And it took less than 6 months from 
the time it became law until the Sen-
ate passed a bill to fund the CHIPS 
Program. That bill was called the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act passed 
by the Senate with a vote of 68 to 32. 
Despite the broad bipartisan support 
for the CHIPS Program, the House re-
fused to pass the Senate bill not be-
cause it was a bad bill, but because it 
wasn’t a partisan grab bag that pro-
vided billions for longstanding liberal 
policies. 
Their ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda 
was 6 feet under, and they saw a must- 
pass national security bill as a conven-
ient way to resurrect it. Their partisan 
legislation known as the COMPETES 
Act, 
included 
handouts 
for 
labor 
unions, a key supporter for the Demo-
cratic Party. The labor bosses were 
promised some pretty big benefits that 
never came to pass, and this was the 
way that House Democrats saw to re-
spond. 
They also tacked on a range of unre-
lated partisan provisions, like an $8 bil-
lion payment to a U.N. climate slush 
fund, which has provided more than 
$100 million to China. The stated pur-
pose of our efforts in USICA—the 
United States Innovation and Competi-
tion Act—has been to counter threats 
from China, not to subsidize them with 
taxpayer dollars, which apparently is 
what the House has chosen to do. 
Well, 
throughout 
the 
conference 
committee process, Republicans have 
pushed back against the long list of un-
related and downright harmful provi-
sions. 
This 
bill 
should 
be 
about 
safe-
guarding our critical supply chains and 
strengthening our competitiveness, not 
doling out partisan political favors. 
Negotiations have made progress, 
but, frankly, we are running out of 
time, and time is of the essence. Last 
month, more than 120 tech CEOs sent a 
letter to congressional leaders urging 
quick action on this legislation. 
And we are seeing signs that a failure 
to act will lead to these critical invest-
ments being made not in the United 
States but outside of the United 
States, just the opposite of what we 
hoped to attain. 
A company called GlobalWafers is 
planning to build a silicon wafer fac-
tory in Sherman, TX, that would cre-
ate up to 1,500 jobs and produce 1.2 mil-
lion wafers a month. These silicon wa-
fers are an essential component of 
semiconductors. 
But last month, Secretary of Com-
merce Gina Raimondo said the CEO 
told her that the plan was contingent 
on Congress passing the CHIPS Act 
funding. Unless the funding is approved 
by the August recess, the company will 
scrap plans for the facility. 
A couple of weeks ago, the CEO of 
Intel expressed a similar sentiment. He 
said the company could expand chip 
production in Europe instead of the 
United States if Congress fails to pass 
this funding. 
So the stakes are high, as is the need 
to move quickly, but apparently none 
of that matters to the majority leader 
and House Democrats. They have cho-
sen to ignore this rapidly closing win-
dow of opportunity and the national se-
curity risks associated with the cur-
rent chip shortage. 
They have chosen to ignore the jobs 
and investments this bill would bring 
to States all across this country. They 
have chosen to ignore the symphony of 
voices from across the spectrum who 
want to get this done. 
And for what? Apparently, another 
unwanted and unnecessary partisan 
spending spree—this trillion-dollar pro-
posal known as a reconciliation bill, 
which is a spinoff of Build Back Better, 
which I affectionately call ‘‘Build Back 
Broke.’’ 
This proposal would attack oil and 
gas producers at a time when gas prices 
remain at record highs, and one of the 
most urgent needs of everyday, work-
ing American families is to bring down 
the price of gasoline at the pump so 
they can afford to take their kids to 
school and go to work. 
Yet the partisan reconciliation bill 
that the majority leader contemplates 
bringing up would actually make that 
problem worse, not better. 
This 
partisan 
reconciliation 
bill 
would also increase taxes on American 
families, as their budgets are already 
being pummeled by inflation. And it 
could be that we are already in a reces-
sion, technically defined as two quar-
ters of negative GDP.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3195 
July 11, 2022 
Well, one thing President Obama rec-
ognized back after the great recession 
of 2008, is it is not a time to raise 
taxes, 
and 
apparently the current 
Biden administration did not learn 
that lesson, nor did the majority lead-
er. 
This bill would simply make infla-
tion worse, not better. Why the Demo-
cratic leader has prioritized partisan 
politics over sound, bipartisan policy is 
lost on me. Why he would elevate par-
tisanship above national security is 
lost on me. And why he would show 
contempt for the challenges families 
are facing due to failed policies of the 
Biden administration is lost on me. 
But now he is doubling down. His de-
cision to pursue this partisan reconcili-
ation bill won’t just hurt families, it 
risks our ability to pass critical CHIPS 
funding on a timely basis. 
To reiterate the words of the Repub-
lican leader: There will be no bipar-
tisan USICA as long as Democrats are 
pursuing their reckless tax-and-spend-
ing agenda. Our Democratic colleagues 
cannot spend their mornings working 
on a purely partisan spending spree for 
the next 4 weeks and expect Repub-
licans to work with them on a bipar-
tisan bill in the afternoon. 
We simply don’t have time for these 
antics. Bipartisan conference negotia-
tions require compromise and con-
fidence that the person sitting across 
the table from you is negotiating in 
good faith. 
Senator SCHUMER’s tactics have jeop-
ardized the good faith that has driven 
this process up until now. 
From the beginning, what was origi-
nally known as Endless Frontiers to 
now the U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act, or USICA—this has been a big 
bipartisan effort. 
Two years ago, I introduced the 
CHIPS for America Act with Senator 
WARNER, the chairman of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee on which I sit, 
and a Democrat. We worked in good 
faith to get it signed into law as part of 
the national defense reuthorization 
act. And we all worked together—68 of 
us—to make sure that the bill was 
funded through the bipartisan U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act. 
And more recently, I have been try-
ing to help broker an agreement that 
can get this bill signed into law as part 
of the conference committee process. 
My desire to fund the CHIPS Act has 
not changed, but Senator SCHUMER’s 
choices have taken an already difficult 
job and made it nearly impossible. 
He is trying to turn what has been a 
bipartisan process into a partisan exer-
cise. I hope the Democratic leader will 
reconsider and will abandon his par-
tisan spending spree so that we can 
spend the next 3 weeks passing the 
CHIPS funding as part of the USICA 
with broad bipartisan support. 
This is a matter of national security 
and economic competitiveness, and it 
should not become a victim of partisan 
games. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HONORING OFFICER JEREMIAH JAMES STORY 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today with my fellow Senator from 
Arkansas, Mr. COTTON, to honor Jere-
miah James Story, a Perry County De-
tention Center officer, who made the 
ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty 
last month. 
Born in Conway, AR, Jeremiah was a 
2020 graduate of Bigelow High School. 
Even as a young person, he was a dedi-
cated public servant who loved his 
community and his country. In addi-
tion to working as a detention officer, 
he also served in the Army National 
Guard and aspired to become a State 
trooper. He wore his uniforms with 
pride and was passionate about giving 
back to others in a variety of ways. 
There was no gesture too small or un-
important for him to offer. 
Jeremiah was also a man of deep 
faith, who never let pass an oppor-
tunity to share it with others. He de-
voted his life to following his Lord and 
Savior and was a longtime member of 
Riverview Baptist Church, where he 
routinely encouraged people he met to 
attend services with him. 
With his Christian belief as his hope 
and guide, he demonstrated kindness 
and compassion for others and relied 
on the power of prayer to support and 
uplift others facing difficult situations. 
Jeremiah’s friends and family knew 
he was special and strived to live by 
the example that he set. 
During a military training exercise 
last year, fellow troops recalled how 
Jeremiah suffered from trench foot, 
and while he was ordered to stay off his 
feet, he couldn’t resist the urge to 
serve others. So in spite of instructions 
and consequences to his own recovery, 
he jumped up and filled water bottles 
for his fellow troops. That was the kind 
of person he was—a giver. 
Those who served alongside him re-
called the tough situations they experi-
enced together. While it was taxing to 
be away from family and living in chal-
lenging conditions, Jeremiah did it 
with a smile on his face. 
He served his community with tre-
mendous care and devotion. We are so 
grateful for his example and willing-
ness to do the tough and dangerous job 
of ensuring public safety. 
At the young age of 21, he was taken 
far too soon. While his life on Earth 
was short, he left a lasting legacy 
through the way he treated, cared for, 
and loved others. 
Even the inmates he was responsible 
for guarding appreciated his care and 
empathy. Several of them attended a 
memorial service for him to show their 
gratitude and their respect. 
He will be dearly missed by many, in-
cluding his closest loved ones, but his 
memory will live on as a hero who 
made a positive impact on all those 
whose lives he touched. 
His death is a tragic reminder of the 
risk law enforcement officers face each 
day that they put on their uniform and 
leave the comforts of their homes and 
their loved ones to serve and to pro-
tect. 
Senator COTTON and I are honored to 
pay this tribute to him to bring atten-
tion to his short but meaningful life 
and remember the noble calling he was 
willing to risk his life to answer. 
I pray for his family, friends, and col-
leagues, as they mourn the fallen 
guardian who served others to the very 
end. May he rest in peace, and may God 
bless him and keep him and all those 
that he leaves behind. 
I yield to Senator COTTON. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
today, I join Senator BOOZMAN with a 
heavy heart to mourn the death of a 
young patriot and a selfless public 
servant. 
Last month, Jeremiah Story, a mem-
ber of the Arkansas National Guard 
and a correctional officer at the Perry 
County Sheriff’s Office, died in the line 
of duty. Officer Story was only 21 years 
old. He worked at the Perry County 
Detention Center and hoped to one day 
become a State trooper. 
He was known as an infectious source 
of joy among his friends and within his 
community, always uplifting those who 
needed cheering up and including those 
who felt left out. He was a devoted 
Christian who encouraged everyone to 
go to church and who shared the gospel 
with anyone who would listen. And he 
loved America, joining the Army Na-
tional Guard as soon as he graduated 
from high school. Jeremiah Story was 
the type of selfless servant every young 
person should aspire to be. 
Three weeks ago, Officer Story was 
in the process of booking a drug crimi-
nal at the Perry County Detention 
Center when the criminal pulled out a 
concealed pistol and shot Officer Story 
in the chest. He died soon thereafter at 
a Conway hospital, and the coward who 
shot him is now charged with capital 
murder, as he should be. 
His murderer didn’t get away with 
anything, didn’t gain anything, didn’t 
escape—nothing for this evil deed. He 
only snuffed out a bright, young, won-
derful life. 
He should know, and every criminal 
in our State should know, that justice 
will be rendered for this awful slaying. 
In the aftermath of Officer Story’s 
death, hundreds of Arkansans have 
come together to remember his life and 
mourn his loss. Among those who at-
tended candlelight vigils for this spe-
cial young man were the inmates at 
the Perry County Detention Center. 
The chaplain of the detention center 
said Officer Story was ‘‘loved by a lot 
of different people, not just outside but

inside.’’ He added that he had used Offi-
cer Story as an ‘‘example setter’’ for 
the inmates for the kind of citizen and 
man they could aspire to be if they 
turned their lives around. 
Officer Story’s example lives on. 
Those who knew him, those who have 
just now heard of him, can draw inspi-
ration for a life well lived. In 21 short 
years, Officer Story did more good and 
spread more joy than many others who 
have been blessed with many more 
years on this Earth. 
He was a great Arkansan and a great 
American. May God bless and keep Of-
ficer Jeremiah Story, and may God 
console his family and friends in this 
time of grief. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, for over a year, officials in the 
Biden administration have operated 
under the assumption that if they keep 
repeating their far-left propaganda, 
they will be able to trick the American 
people into believing that everything is 
OK. Don’t believe what you see. Don’t 
believe what you are reading. Don’t be-
lieve what you are hearing from friends 
and neighbors. Just believe us. Every-
thing is fine. Prices aren’t high. Crime 
is not high. The border is not open. Ev-
erything is just fine. 
The problem is, Tennesseeans know 
better than to believe this. They have 
figured it out. They know the economy 
is not in a good place. They know high 
gas prices are not Putin’s fault. They 
know that spikes in crime and drug 
overdoses—this is not normal. But 
most importantly, they know that 
standing aside and letting the country 
fall apart is not what a normal Presi-
dential administration does; it is far 
from it. 
The White House has worked over-
time trying to convince the American 
people that reports of the chaos along 
our southern border are exaggerated. 
This is one of the most dangerous false-
hoods the Biden administration has 
tried to sell, and here is why. In May— 
May, this month of May—this year, 
Border Patrol encountered more than 
177,000 unique individuals trying to 
cross the border. 
Border Patrol doesn’t have the man-
power or the resources to control this 
wave of illegal immigration. I know it. 
I think my Democratic colleagues 
know it. Certainly the ones who have 
taken the time to go to the border 
know it. And, no doubt, the Biden ad-
ministration knows it. 
As I said, in May of this year, 177,000 
different individuals were encountered 
trying to cross that border. Now, 
Tennesseeans are very worried about 
this, and they want to know why the 
President is not worried about this. 
For goodness’ sake, he has never taken 
the time to go to the border. He has 
had five decades to go down there and 
look at the border, and he has never 
taken the time to do it. 
It really is pretty simple for ‘‘we the 
people,’’ the citizenry of this country— 
the issue of whether the Democrats 
wish this country well is no longer up 
for debate. They know that the left has 
abandoned them, the people. They 
know that. They are seeing it every 
single day, whether they are shopping 
for groceries, filling up the car. They 
see it. They see it by the crime in the 
streets, the gangs. They know it. They 
see it with the human trafficking and 
the suffering and the drugs that are 
killing precious American lives. 
Now, unfortunately, President Biden 
lost the opportunity to persuade the 
American people otherwise on day 1 of 
his administration when he chose to 
turn the American Southwest into a 
free-for-all. Since then, things have 
only gotten more dangerous. 
During the first 4 days of this month, 
law enforcement officials arrested 3 
members of MS–13, an 18th Street gang 
member, and multiple convicted sex of-
fenders as they tried to enter the coun-
try. On July 6, they seized more than 
1,000 pounds of meth from one single 
smuggler—that is right, one smuggler. 
Do you think the drug dealers are 
emboldened? Think about that—1,000 
pounds of meth. So far this year, they 
have seized almost 8,000 pounds of 
fentanyl, which is enough to kill a 
small country. 
Here is the question I would pose to 
the President: How many people and 
how many pounds of drugs made it in 
while Border Patrol agents were busy 
with the smugglers and criminals they 
managed to catch? Where did the ‘‘got- 
aways’’ go? What did the ‘‘got-aways’’ 
have with them? 
Well, that is a rhetorical question. 
We know exactly where they went, and 
we know what they have with them. Do 
you know what, Madam President. 
They are coming to our own cities, 
communities, towns, our own back-
yards. 
My Democratic colleagues may be 
happy to ignore the problem, but on be-
half of Tennesseeans, I will not ignore 
the problem. The threat is too great. 
If you ask any law enforcement offi-
cer—any—they will tell you that this 
issue of the southern border is a matter 
of life and death. Not just on the bor-
der but in each of our 95 counties in the 
State of Tennessee—in each of our 
towns and cities—this open border is a 
matter of life and death. In Tennessee, 
our sheriffs and police chiefs want the 
border secured. 
I have got to tell you, to so many 
Tennesseans, it is laughable—laugh-
able—that a White House spokesman 
would stand behind that podium and 
look at the people and say: ‘‘The border 
is secure.’’ Who do they think they are 
talking to? Do they think that people 
are not watching the footage? Whether 
they are watching it on TV or stream-
ing it or looking at it on social media, 
they can see that this border is not se-
cure. They are talking to friends and 
relatives who live in a border State, 
who live along that border, and they 
are telling them some of the horrific 
stories that they are witnessing every 
single day in their communities. 
We know for a fact that the cross- 
border drug trade is alive and well. 
Who is getting rich off this open south-
ern border? Take a guess. It is the drug 
cartels—the drug cartels—with enor-
mous profits growing into a global or-
ganization. That is right—global. 
So far this year, people from 150 dif-
ferent countries have come across our 
southern border. Chinese nationals are 
not trying to come in here on a visa. 
They don’t wish us well. The Chinese 
Communist Party is hard at work. The 
Chinese Communist Party is paying 
the cartels $50,000 a pop to get people 
into our country that they want to by 
bringing them across the southern bor-
der. 
The Tennessean, which is our news-
paper in Nashville, TN, recently re-
ported a truly horrific story about a 
multimillion-dollar crime ring that is 
operating right out of Middle Ten-
nessee. That is right. The drug cartels 
are not fearful because Joe Biden has 
the welcome mat out: Border open. 
The kingpin was working directly 
with the Sinaloa drug cartel. That is 
the one that primarily has the Arizona 
border. That is the one that is bringing 
a majority of the drugs through Ari-
zona. They like to focus on fentanyl. 
The traffickers who are working un-
derneath this hoodlum are as brutally 
violent as their friends down in Mexico. 
We know they are responsible for mul-
tiple horrific assaults, kidnappings, at 
least one murder, and the mutilation of 
a 22-year-old woman. They are also 
linked to a local gang who terrorizes 
the streets of Nashville. That is right, 
a drug kingpin working directly with 
the Sinaloa cartel. That is what they 
are doing in Tennessee. 
The violence does not stop at the bor-
der. The violence in this country in-
creases because of that open border and 
because of the unwillingness of this ad-
ministration to do anything about it. 
This violence is bleeding into every 
town, every State, and it will not stop 
until we have leaders in the White 
House and an administration who are 
willing to put themselves in between 
these monsters and the American peo-
ple. 
The fact that we can’t talk about 
this without provoking hysteria in the 
ranks of the Democratic Party tells me 
we are heading in the wrong direction, 
but don’t take my word for it; just read 
a number of polls that are out there. I 
hope the President takes to heart that 
33-percent job approval rating that the 
New York Times reported on today. 
That is about as significant a message 
as could be sent to this administration. 
Only 33 percent of the American people 
approve of what this administration is 
doing. 
This administration has normalized 
things that even 5 years ago would 
have shocked the conscience of your 
average 
Democrat. 
We

about 
spending in trillions of dollars now—a

trillion here and there, $6 trillion for 
COVID, and let’s spend another $2 tril-
lion on ‘‘Build Back Broke.’’ The num-
bers just keep piling up. We talk about 
apprehending 170,000 people at the bor-
der in a month—not in a year but in a 
month. We talk about drug seizures in 
measures of pounds, not ounces. 
I was talking with one of our sheriffs 
in Tennessee, and we were talking 
about this issue. 
He said: You know, Marsha, we used 
to apprehend drugs, and it would be in 
grams or it would be in ounces, and 
now nearly every seizure is in pounds. 
That is the change. The drug cartels 
are not fearful of being caught or 
stopped at that border. They have fig-
ured it out. 
Sadly, this is life in Joe Biden’s 
America, but none of this—none of it, 
nothing, not one part of what you are 
seeing in Joe Biden’s America—is com-
patible with an optimistic vision for 
the future, with that phrase ‘‘a more 
perfect Union,’’ ‘‘equal justice,’’ ‘‘equal 
opportunity’’—none of it. Why? When 
Tennesseans look at what Joe Biden 
and the Democrats are doing, what 
they are seeing is a political machine 
acting like they are on a deadline. 
They are burning through an agenda 
that the American people did not ask 
for and they definitely do not want. 
Do they want higher taxes? Abso-
lutely not. 
Do they want an open border? They 
have said time and again, no. 
Do they want higher crime? No. 
Do they want drugs—fentanyl—kill-
ing 71,000 Americans in a year? No. No. 
Do they want the highest inflation 
that we have had in 40 years? No. 
Do they want a foreign policy that 
doesn’t work? We have a disaster in Af-
ghanistan. We have the Chinese Com-
munist Party, after we have Russia and 
Putin out here, acting like they are in 
control. We have the axis of evil—Rus-
sia, China, Iran, North Korea—out try-
ing to recruit friends and allies into 
their axis of evil to not wish us well. Is 
that what the American people want? 
No, it is not. 
Do they want mandates? Do they 
want lockdowns? No, they do not. That 
is not what they want. 
The people of this country still have 
a vision for the future, but it is hard to 
keep hope alive when the people in con-
trol of the government have, obviously, 
lost control of this country. 
I love going around Tennessee, and I 
love having great conversations with 
people who will tell you they are 
Democrats or Republicans. They want 
to know if the Democratic Party is de-
lusional. Are they obsessed with a so-
cialist agenda? Are they out of touch 
with what it feels like to not have 
money to fill up the gas tank, to not 
have money to buy that full bag of gro-
ceries? 
The idea that their President would 
allow our border to be open to drug 
cartels and smugglers to take advan-
tage of us, the people, terrifies Ten-
nesseans, but it is also something that 
makes them angry because they know 
Joe Biden could do something about 
this if he wanted to. They know that 
the Democratic Party, which runs ev-
erything in this town—the House, the 
Senate, the White House—could do 
something about this if they chose to. 
Law enforcement, Border Patrol, and 
advocates who work with drug addicts 
and the victims of human smuggling 
are in almost unanimous agreement on 
a few points. 
First, what I have heard from them is 
this President, President Biden, must 
keep title 42 in place until there is a 
plan for how they would replace it. 
Title 42 is essential. This President 
must embrace a Remain in Mexico pol-
icy, and this President must do what 
the Border Patrol has asked to be done 
for three decades, and that is to build 
the wall and give them the tools they 
need to get their job done. These are 
all of the things that President Biden 
could choose to do right now. 
So why is he refusing to take action? 
If you know, the American people 
would really like to have an answer be-
cause they look at the chaos coming 
from this administration, the chaos at 
the border, and the chaos on our 
streets, and they know that this coun-
try deserves better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3198 
July 11, 2022 
REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SE-
CRECY—TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 
117–3 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the injunction of secrecy be 
removed from the following treaty 
transmitted to the Senate on July 11, 
2022, by the President of the United 
States: 
Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 
1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Fin-
land and the Kingdom of Sweden (Treaty 
Document No. 117–3). 
I further ask that the treaty be con-
sidered as having been read the first 
time; that it be referred, with accom-
panying papers, to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations and ordered to be 
printed; and that the President’s mes-
sage be printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The message of the President is as 
follows: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
I transmit herewith, for the advice 
and consent of the Senate to its ratifi-
cation, the Protocols to the North At-
lantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession 
of the Republic of Finland and the 
Kingdom of Sweden ( the ‘‘Protocols’’). 
The Protocols were signed in Brussels 
on July 5, 2022, on behalf of the United 
States and the other Parties to the 
North Atlantic Treaty. Also trans-
mitted for the information of the Sen-
ate is an overview of the Protocols by 
the Department of State. Full ratifica-
tion of the Protocols will allow Finland 
and Sweden to become Parties to the 
North Atlantic Treaty and members of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO). 
Article 10 of the North Atlantic Trea-
ty, which outlines NATO’s Open Door 
policy, is part of the doctrinal founda-
tion of the Alliance. It states that Al-
lies may, by unanimous consent, invite 
any other European State in a position 
to further the principles of the Treaty 
and to contribute to the security of the 
North Atlantic area to accede. As fur-
ther explained in the reports on the ac-
cession of Finland and Sweden to 
NATO, transmitted to the Congress on 
May 19 and July 1, 2022, in light of sec-
tion 3(2)(E) of the Resolution of Advice 
and Consent to Ratification of the Pro-
tocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 
1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hun-
gary, and the Czech Republic of April 
30, 1998, Finland and Sweden more than 
meet these qualifications. They will be 
net contributors to the Alliance, in 
both capabilities and resources, and 
they share critically important values 
with the United States. Finland’s and 
Sweden’s accession will help further 
United States priorities within NATO. 
I ask the Senate to continue working 
with my Administration in advancing a 
strong and free Europe by providing its 
prompt advice and consent to ratifica-
tion of the Protocols. We are encour-
aging all Allies to act expeditiously in 
their own ratification processes as 
well, given current global consider-
ations. 
My 
Administration 
stands 
ready to brief and assist you in your 
deliberations. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.
THE WHITE HOUSE, July 11, 2022. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNIZING THE KENNEDY 
SPACE CENTER 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize the John F. Kennedy 
Space Center—KSC—for celebrating its 
60th anniversary, which we observed on 
July 1, 2022. While the complex was not 
named after President Kennedy until 
November 29, 1963, it was on July 1 six 
decades ago that the launch operations 
center on Merritt Island, FL, was cre-
ated. 
Since the Apollo program in 1968, 
every U.S. crewed orbital spaceflight 
has launched from the Kennedy Space 
Center property, making it the unam-
biguous 
leader 
in 
American 
spaceflight. The National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration—NASA—has 
carried out launch operations for its 
Apollo, Skylab, and space shuttle pro-
grams from Launch Complex 39, man-
aged by KSC’s personnel. For the past 
60 years, millions of Americans have 
visited the area to watch astronauts 
slip the face of Earth and explore the 
final frontier. 
After the retirement of the Space 
Shuttle program in 2011, the Kennedy 
Space Center transformed from a gov-
ernment-focused 
launch 
base 
to 
a 
multi-user spaceport. Today, it pro-
vides a home to more than 90 private- 
sector partners and nearly 250 partner-
ship agreements in support of different 
vehicles, systems, and launch pro-
viders, enabling a new era of space ex-
ploration. The Kennedy Space Center 
further contributes to our Nation’s 
space program through the Exploration 
Ground Systems, as well as the Com-
mercial Crew, Exploration Research 
and Technology, and Launch Services 
Programs. 
As NASA prepares for the launch of 
Artemis I at KSC, the center remains a 
cornerstone of Florida’s economy by 
employing thousands of civil servants 
and government contractors through-
out the State’s Space Coast. 
I express my thanks and deepest 
gratitude to the many hard-working 
men and women at the Kennedy Space 
Center as they continue to advance 
American space exploration further 
into the 21st century. 
RECOGNIZING ST. JOSEPH 
HEALTHCARE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, St. Jo-
seph Healthcare of Bangor, ME, was 
founded in 1947 by the Felician Sisters 
with a mission to support the wellness 
and healing of a patient’s mind, body, 
and spirit. On this 75th anniversary, I 
congratulate this outstanding institu-
tion for carrying out that mission with 
expertise and compassion. 
St. Joseph is a 112-bed acute care 
community hospital that brings to-
gether primary care providers and spe-
cialists focused on delivering personal-
ized medicine in more than 30 depart-
ments. It is a member of Covenant 
Health, an innovative, Catholic re-
gional health delivery network that is 
a leader in values-based, not-for-profit 
health and elder care. 
The St. Joseph story began in 1855 in 
Warsaw, Poland, when Blessed Angela 
founded the Congregation of the Sis-
ters of St. Felix, an order dedicated to 
serving the poor, the sick, and the dis-
abled. The Felician Sisters were found-
ed with a particular focus on serving 
the Polish countryside. St. Joseph 
Healthcare continues that tradition by 
its efforts to ensure healthcare services 
for rural Maine. 
St. 
Joseph’s 
contributions 
as 
a 
healthcare provider are enormous but 
only part of its mission. The hospital’s 
facilities have been applied to such 
needs as providing laundry and food 
services to the area’s homeless shel-
ters. A food pantry, an elementary 
school backpack program, and a com-
munity vegetable exchange stand help 
alleviate food insecurity. St. Joseph’s 
Closet provides patients who are being 
discharged with needed clothing. The 
Blessing Bag program provides food, 
winter clothing, and basic personal hy-
giene items to homeless emergency 
room patients. 
Countless other acts of kindness 
complement the St. Joseph mission of 
meeting the spiritual and religious 
needs of patients regardless of their be-
liefs and traditions or spirituality. The 
16th century Capuchin friar canonized 
St. Felix was known in his time as 
‘‘the saint of the streets of Rome’’ for 
his daily journeys through the city dis-
pensing food, medicine, and comfort to 
the poor, the sick, and the troubled. 
The dedicated staff and leadership of 
St. Joseph Healthcare continue that 
legacy through the streets of Bangor 
and the country roads of Maine, and I 
thank them for their blessed service.

50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
HONOR 
THE EARTH HOMECOMING CELE-
BRATION AND POWWOW 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of the Honor the Earth Homecoming 
Celebration and Powwow. The story of 
Honor the Earth begins with a small 
group of Lac Courte Oreilles who want-
ed a better future for their tribe and 
their people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3199 
July 11, 2022 
The Lac Courte Oreilles Tribe— 
Ojibwe: 
Odaawaa-zaaga’iganiing—is 
one of six federally recognized bands of 
the large Ojibwe Nation that originally 
occupied the upper eastern woodlands 
area of the North American continent. 
The Treaty of 1854 established the LCO 
reservation. 
In 1971, the LCO community, and 
other people from neighboring bands 
and Tribes took over Winter Dam in 
protest of flooding lands, broken trea-
ties, and desecration of LCO land, peo-
ple, and traditional livelihood. Eddie 
Benton-Benaim, 
supported 
by 
the 
American Indian Movement, helped 
lead the 5-day effort to take over the 
dam. This effort led to the renegoti-
ation of the dam license which helped 
the tribe recover several hundred acres 
of land, compensation for damages, and 
the development of Tribal hydro gener-
ating project. 
The following year, 1972, there was a 
reunion of the people who had occupied 
the dam; they called it Honor the 
Earth powwow. Every year since, the 
Ojibwa people come together as they 
have always done; they celebrate with 
prayers, feasting, songs, dances, and 
honoring. The 1972 and 1973 powwows 
were organized as contest powwows and 
were sponsored by a handful of individ-
uals and then by LCO AIM, LCO Tribal 
Governing Board, and the St. Paul Red 
School House, of which Benton was di-
rector. In 1974, grounds were broken for 
what would eventually become one of 
the largest traditional gatherings of 
Tribal peoples in the region. 
In 1982 the first annual Miss Honor 
the Earth’s ladies competition began at 
the powwow to showcase the strong 
and 
beautiful 
Anishinaabekwewag— 
Ojibwe 
ladies—perform 
a 
woodland 
dance while wearing historical deer 
dresses. 
This year, 2022, we celebrate the 50th 
Honor the Earth Powwow and the 40th 
Miss Honor the Earth ladies competi-
tion. In so doing, the Anishinabeg, the 
Lac Courte Oreilles or ‘‘Ottawa Lake’’ 
Tribe continues to sustain heritage, 
preserve and utilize the strong Ojibwe 
language, honor strengths of the past, 
and embrace a good future. Please join 
me in celebrating this historically and 
spiritually important community. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO EDWARD FERGUSON 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor of the Senate to honor an 
important member of Her Majesty’s 
diplomatic service, Mr. Edward Fer-
guson. Edward has been the latest in a 
long line of impressive British dip-
lomats who have furthered the Special 
Relationship between the United King-
dom and United States. 
Edward has served as the Minister 
Counsellor for Defence at British Em-
bassy in Washington, DC. The Minister 
Counsellor is the senior Ministry of 
Defence—MOD—civil servant in the 
embassy. This position is responsible 
for aspects of the bilateral defense re-
lationship, paying close attention to 
defense strategy; security and oper-
ational policy; acquisition and trade. 
Since arriving in September 2018, Ed-
ward has played a pivotal role in fur-
ther strengthening the already indis-
pensable United States-United King-
dom defense relationship. As the UK’s 
senior policy adviser on defense rela-
tions with the United States, he was 
responsible for United Kingdom-United 
States collaboration on strategic plan-
ning, nuclear policy and programmes, 
trade and acquisition, and science and 
technology. He can point to a number 
of significant successes on his watch, 
not least the signing of the Australia- 
United 
Kingdom-United 
States— 
AUKUS—Agreement. 
Prior to his service at the British 
Embassy Washington, Edward served 
as Her Majesty’s Ambassador to Bosnia 
and Herzegovina from 2014 to 2018, 
where he created and led a new inter-
national strategy, co-launched by the 
British and German Foreign Ministers, 
that re-energised Euro-Atlantic inte-
gration after years of stagnation, while 
stimulating economic growth and re-
ducing high levels of youth unemploy-
ment. 
From 2011 to 2014, Edward was Head 
of Defence Strategy and Priorities, 
where he led two teams, one respon-
sible for leading the MOD’s contribu-
tion to developing the 2015 National Se-
curity Strategy and the Strategic 
Defence and Security Review and the 
other for prioritising the MOD’s inter-
national defence engagement activi-
ties. 
A former exhibitioner and choral 
scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, 
where he was also treasurer of the Ox-
ford Union, Edward graduated with 
first class honours in classics in 2001. 
In 2013, he graduated from the London 
School of Economics and Political 
Science with an MSc with distinction 
in strategy and diplomacy. He has been 
a member of the Royal College of 
Defence Studies—RCDS—strategic ad-
visory panel, a member of the US Air 
Force Grand Strategy Advisory Board, 
and is a graduate of the PINNACLE 
Command and Staff course at National 
Defense University—NDU. 
Edward has served in numerous roles 
within the Ministry of Defence, start-
ing out in the Iraq Secretariat during 
the build-up to and subsequent execu-
tion of Operation TELIC in 2003. In 
2006, he volunteered for an operational 
tour, serving as political advisor to a 
British battlegroup in Maysaan Prov-
ince, Iraq—while his brother was a 
troop leader with the British Army in 
Basra. On his return, he took on re-
sponsibility for the strategic manage-
ment of the United Kingdom’s bilateral 
defence 
relations 
with 
the 
United 
States, Canada, and Western Europe. 
From 2007 to 2009, he worked as Pri-
vate Secretary to three Defence Secre-
taries, acting as their closest adviser 
on issues relating to operations in Iraq, 
the £6-billion defence equipment pro-
gramme, science and technology, coun-
terterrorism and counterpiracy. 
In 2009, he was appointed the head of 
Afghanistan and Pakistan policy, re-
sponsible for advice to the National Se-
curity Council on the policy, financial, 
legal, 
parliamentary, 
and 
presen-
tational aspects of the UK military 
contribution to operations in Afghani-
stan and on the long-term defence role 
and interests in Pakistan. 
Edward has been a key voice engag-
ing on behalf of Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment, particularly with Congress. He 
has been a strong proponent of increas-
ing the breadth and depth of the bilat-
eral relationship since his arrival at 
the embassy and has gained many 
friends and allies in a bipartisan basis 
throughout Capitol Hill. He has trav-
elled far and wide throughout the 
heartland of the United States—and 
has many excellent memories of Amer-
ican hospitality to show for it. His 
presence and strong support of the 
Trans-Atlantic Alliance will be sorely 
missed, but I know he will always be a 
stalwart advocate for our alliance. 
I know I speak for a chorus of voices 
in the Senate in wishing him, his wife 
Caroline, and their children, Henry, 
Tessa, and Mimi well as they transi-
tion into their next diplomatic posting.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SHEILA AND RON 
WETJEN 
∑ Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to submit for the record a 
statement of commendation to Sheila 
and Ronald Wetjen for recently cele-
brating their 50th wedding anniversary. 
Sheila and Ron were married on Feb-
ruary 5, 1972, in Dubuque, IA, and 
raised five children: Nicholas, Mark, 
Sean, Melissa, and Amanda. They also 
now have nine grandchildren: Grace, 
Cullen, 
Xavier, 
Rourke, 
Reece, 
Finnegan, 
Rockwell, 
Sophia, 
and 
Wyatt. 
I would like to commend Sheila and 
Ron for their commitment to each 
other, their children, their grand-
children, their faith, and their country. 
Sheila and Ron represent so many of 
the ideals that gave rise to this great 
country and bind it together today— 
the importance of family and an endur-
ing selflessness and faith in others that 
speaks to a firm commitment to the 
common good. We wish Sheila and Ron 
our congratulations all for this great 
achievement and wish them many 
more years of faithful marriage.∑

REMEMBERING ERIC FEAVER 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
like to share a few words today to 
honor an outstanding leader and friend 
of mine who recently passed away. Eric 
Feaver was a force in Montana and a 
lifelong advocate for educators across 
our State. He was the former president 
of Montana’s teacher’s union who de-
voted more than 40 years to improving 
the State’s public school system. His 
commitment to Montana’s working

families was tangible and had a pro-
found impact on public policy. It is safe 
to say the Treasure State wouldn’t be 
what it is today without him. 
As a fierce advocate for the labor 
movement, Eric was an inspiration to 
fellow labor leaders, politicians, teach-
ers, students, and community members 
alike. It takes a lot these days to reach 
across party lines, but Eric consist-
ently worked with those who held dif-
ferent views. Just ask some of the folks 
who worked with Eric. They will tell 
you, even though they didn’t always 
agree with him, they respected him. 
Raised in Oklahoma and sent to Viet-
nam as a conscientious objector and 
U.S. Army combat medic at the age of 
23, Eric first planted roots in Montana 
when he landed a teaching job at Hel-
ena Junior High School in 1974. It 
didn’t take long for Eric to find his 
way into the State’s labor movement, 
where he would spend nearly 50 years 
helping shape education and union pol-
icy. 
As a result of Eric’s charisma and ex-
pertise, he was elected president of the 
Montana 
Education 
Association 
in 
1984, and in 2000, he led MEA to a mon-
umental merger with the Montana Fed-
eration of Teachers. As president of 
MEA–MFT, Eric spearheaded another 
major merger, which resulted in the 
creation of the Montana Federation of 
Public 
Employees, 
an 
organization 
that today represents more than 25,000 
public sector employees. Over the 
years, Eric continued to bring together 
folks across Montana. And he managed 
to do a lot of good for the State’s work-
force and public schools in the process. 
But even more than his accomplish-
ments, I think Eric will be remembered 
for his passion—his genuine commit-
ment to making the Treasure State a 
better, fairer place to live and work. 
I am lucky to have called Eric a 
friend. His legacy and his friendship 
have left a lasting imprint on me and 
so many others. I extend my deepest 
condolences to Eric’s wife, Ellen; their 
two daughters, Amity and Ashley; two 
sons-in-law, 
Rich 
and 
TJ; 
grand-
children, Tristin, Cameron, Braden, 
Halo, Ethan, and Oliver; and his broth-
ers, Douglas and Edward. 
While Eric is no longer with us, he 
will go down in Montana history as one 
of the State’s greatest labor leaders 
and champions of public education. 
He will be sorely missed.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
701—CALL-
ING FOR A DEMOCRATIC TRANSI-
TION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD 
AND STANDING WITH THE PEO-
PLE OF CHAD 
Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 701 
Whereas the people of the Republic of Chad 
suffered for three decades under the authori-
tarian rule of Idriss Deby, whose government 
was characterized by human rights abuses, 
rampant corruption, gross mismanagement 
of government resources, the suppression of 
civil liberties and fundamental freedoms, in-
cluding freedoms of peaceful assembly and 
expression, and internet blockages; 
Whereas President Idriss Deby impeded the 
ability of the people of Chad to change their 
government by violating constitutionally 
mandated presidential term limits in 2005, 
repeatedly postponing legislative elections 
which were last held in 2011, arresting oppo-
sition party members and civil society activ-
ists, and organizing presidential elections 
that were neither free nor fair; 
Whereas, from 2016 to 2021, authorities in 
Chad blocked or limited access to the inter-
net for 911 days, totaling two and a half 
years, to impede the ability of Chadian citi-
zens to criticize their government, organize 
public protests, hold their government ac-
countable, monitor presidential elections, or 
access outside information; 
Whereas, under the constitution of Chad, 
upon President Deby’s death on April 20, 
2021, power should have passed to the Presi-
dent of the National Assembly to organize 
new democratic elections; 
Whereas, instead of adhering to the con-
stitution, a group of Chadian military offi-
cers installed President Deby’s son, General 
Mahamat Idriss Deby, as Transitional Mili-
tary Council (TMC) president, suspended the 
constitution, and dissolved the government 
and National Assembly; 
Whereas the actions of Mahamat Deby and 
the Chadian military in April 2021 con-
stituted a coup d’etat; 
Whereas security forces in Chad used ex-
cessive force, including live ammunition, 
against civilians protesting the coup in April 
and May 2021, killing at least 7 individuals, 
wounding dozens more, and arresting hun-
dreds; 
Whereas the African Union’s Peace and Se-
curity Council expressed ‘‘grave concern’’ 
with the establishment of the TMC and stat-
ed on May 14, 2021, its ‘‘total rejection of any 
unconstitutional change of government,’’ 
noting the appointment of a prime minister 
and ‘‘civilian-led Transitional Government’’ 
but categorically asserting that no form of 
extension of the transition period beyond the 
18-month timeline of October 22, 2022, would 
be acceptable, and calling on Mahamat Deby 
and members of the TMC to commit to not

contesting or taking part in elections transi-
tional authorities are responsible for orga-
nizing; 
Whereas the African Union reaffirmed on 
August 3, 2021, the need for the Transitional 
Government to respect the 18-month transi-
tional timeline for elections in October 2022 
and reiterated that members of the TMC 
‘‘shall not be eligible to be candidates for the 
elections at the end of the transition’’; 
Whereas the TMC released from jail ap-
proximately 300 people charged with crimes 
of opinion, terrorism, and harming the State 
in November 2021, in advance of a dialogue 
with armed groups in Qatar; 
Whereas the TMC and several dozen rebel 
groups launched a pre-dialogue process in 
Qatar in March 2022, in advance of an inclu-
sive national civilian dialogue in Chad 
scheduled for May 2022; 
Whereas a peaceful and democratic Chad is 
essential for the stability and development 
of Central Africa and the Sahel; 
Whereas Chad faces a dire humanitarian 
crisis due to threats posed by terrorist orga-
nizations and armed groups, regional insta-
bility, climate change, food insecurity, and 
decades of internal mismanagement and cor-
ruption by former President Deby’s govern-
ment; 
Whereas the April 2021 coup d’etat was in-
consistent with the African Growth and Op-
portunity Act (AGOA), which states that 
AGOA eligible countries must have estab-
lished or are making continual progress to-
ward establishing the rule of law and polit-
ical pluralism; and 
Whereas United States security assistance 
to Chad, which has long been prioritized over 
democracy, human rights, and development 
assistance, thereby contributing to the mili-
tarization of the former Government of 
Chad, should remain suspended until demo-
cratic elections are held and civilian rule is 
restored: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the April 2021 military take-
over in Chad as a coup d’etat; 
(2) stands with the people of Chad in their 
democratic aspirations; 
(3) supports the African Union’s call for 
transitional authorities, including General

in accordance with the 18-month timeframe 
articulated by the TMC; and 
(B) commit publicly not to stand as can-
didates in the elections they are responsible 
for organizing; 
(4) calls on General Mahamat Deby and 
leaders of the TMC to— 
(A) immediately release all of those arbi-
trarily arrested during the April-May 2021 
protests; 
(B) ensure that security forces respect 
rights related to freedom of peaceful assem-
bly and expression and hold accountable se-
curity force members responsible for exces-
sive use of force or other human rights 
abuses; 
(C) publicly commit not to run in elec-
tions; 
(D) abide by the 18-month transitional 
timeline for restoring civilian rule via free, 
fair, and peaceful democratic elections and 
return to their barracks; 
(E) support an inclusive national civilian 
dialogue by ensuring that all parties may 
participate freely and openly; 
(F) commit to respecting freedom of ex-
pression, opinion, the press, and access to in-
formation to include unimpeded internet ac-
cess for the people of Chad; and 
(5) calls on the Secretary of State to— 
(A) identify coup leaders and their accom-
plices and enablers working to undermine a 
democratic process in Chad for consideration 
for visa restrictions and targeted financial 
sanctions where available; 
(B) state publicly that those who per-
petrate human rights abuses or works to un-
dermine the democratic process in Chad, in-
cluding by impeding freedoms of peaceful of 
assembly, expression, or association, includ-
ing related to press and access to informa-
tion, will be held accountable, which could 
include through visa restrictions and finan-
cial sanctions where available; 
(C) publicly urge TMC leaders to abide by 
the 18-month transitional timeline, restore 
civilian rule, and publicly commit not to run 
as candidates; 
(D) monitor, discourage, and deter any ef-
fort by external parties to support the exten-
sion of the TMC’s mandate or otherwise 
delay or interfere with the restoration of ci-
vilian rule via free, fair, and peaceful demo-
cratic elections; 
(E) coordinate with other Federal depart-
ments and agencies to— 
(i) suspend non-humanitarian bilateral as-
sistance to the Government of Chad, includ-
ing security assistance, until civilian rule is 
restored via free, fair, and peaceful demo-
cratic elections; 
(ii) prioritize support for an inclusive civil-
ian national dialogue by ensuring the par-
ticipation of opposition party members, civil 
society leaders, women, and youth; 
(iii) prioritize support for a free, fair, and 
peaceful electoral process by working with 
electoral authorities, political party rep-
resentatives, and members of civil society in 
Chad; 
(iv) support, as appropriate, efforts to draft 
a new constitution; 
(v) ensure that the United States bilateral 
policy towards Chad is fully aligned with the 
broader policy for the Sahel called for in the 
Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership 
Program Act of 2022 (division AA of Public 
Law 117–103); and 
(vi) ensure future assistance is appro-
priately balanced between defense, diplo-
macy, and development; and 
(F) direct the Department of the Treasury 
to use the voice and vote of the United 
States in international financial institutions 
to ensure there is a mechanism for civil soci-
ety to have input into the development and 
oversight of programs and activities being 
funded, and that support provided through 
such instructions prioritize the restoration 
of civilian rule, including through free, fair, 
and peaceful democratic elections.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. First, I want to 
thank my colleague and cofounder and 
cochair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus 
for his comments today. 
What you just heard was that the 
White House has sent the application 
for membership to NATO for Finland 
and Sweden to the U.S. Senate. It now 
goes to our committee, the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, and then, I hope, 
to the floor soon. I suspect there will 
be an overwhelming vote because ev-
erybody in this Chamber understands 
the importance not just of NATO ex-
pansion but of these two countries in 
particular. 
I thank my colleague for offering 
those words today, and my hope is we 
can move very quickly on that.

REMEMBERING SHINZO ABE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Before we talk about 
Ukraine, this has been a time over the 
last couple of weeks since we were last 
here in session of a lot of change and 
volatility around the world. 
I want to begin by expressing my 
shock and sorrow over the assassina-
tion of former Japanese Prime Min-
ister Shinzo Abe. I know I speak for all 
Americans when I express my deepest 
condolences to the people of Japan for 
this tragic loss. 
Prime Minister Abe was a dear friend 
to the United States and a leader in 
building new coalitions in the Indo-Pa-
cific to support democracies in the re-
gion and counter the nuclear threat 
from North Korea and China’s various 
malign influences. 
When I visited Japan a few months 
ago with a bipartisan group of Senate 
colleagues, I saw firsthand the changes

that he brought to Japan that are now 
beginning to bear fruit: a stronger and 
more effective national security pos-
ture for Japan; a more confident Japan 
in the region; better trade and security 
ties, including the quad dialogue with 
Japan, Australia, the United States 
and India; and the Indo-Pacific eco-
nomic framework. 
His imprint on Japan and the very 
special alliance we have with Japan 
will be long lasting and beneficial to 
both of our countries. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. I also come to the 
floor today, as was noted, to talk about 
Ukraine. Russia’s brutal assault con-
tinues. We must do more here, not just 
in the United States but around the 
world, to help Ukraine stand up to this 
brutality. 
This marks the 17th consecutive 
week in session that I have been on the 
floor to discuss the unprovoked illegal 
and deadly assault on the people of 
Ukraine. 
This invasion started 138 days ago, 
and it is more critical than ever that 
the United States and our allies sup-
port the efforts of Ukraine to defend 
itself against this assault. 
Let me just recap briefly the situa-
tion on the ground. A lot has happened 
since we talked a couple of weeks ago. 
First, here in the north, you can see 
the light blue, which is the Ukrainian 
advances. The Ukrainians have been 
successful in pushing back against the 
Russian offensive and taking back 
some of the territory around the city 
of Kharkiv. This is a critical area, ob-
viously. 
Kharkiv is the sister city of my 
hometown, Cincinnati, OH. I was in-
volved in that sister city arrangement 
40 years ago, and it is a beautiful city. 
It has been almost flattened by the 
unending and barbaric attacks from 
Russia. 
In the outskirts of Kharkiv, again, 
Ukrainian forces are not just holding 
the line but also making gradual ad-
vances, same as through here, in 
Kherson. You can see there is, again, 
the light blue here that indicates 
where 
the 
Ukrainians 
have 
made 
progress here in the south. 
In the south and in Kharkiv, there 
has been progress made. This is very 
important in the south here because, as 
you know, Russia’s goal is to try to 
shut off the entire Black Sea from 
Ukraine being able to access and, 
therefore, to continue to be one of the 
great exporters of the world. They have 
blocked any passage here of the ships 
that could be sending wheat and other 
grains to the rest of the world, includ-
ing to Africa, where they are very de-
pendent on Ukrainian wheat to keep 
people from starving, and yet the Rus-
sians are blocking these. But these cit-
ies are still in the control of Ukraine, 
and it is essential that continue, that 
Russia 
not 
create 
a 
landlocked 
Ukraine, which would, over the long 
term, be incredibly detrimental to the 
economy of Ukraine. It is vital that 
they do well there. 
I will say, though, that here in the 
east, it is a different situation. Here is 
Donetsk and Luhansk, the Donbas re-
gion. Here is where Russia has made in-
cremental progress in the last couple of 
weeks, using, again, bombs and mis-
siles that are flattening cities, killing 
civilians. 
This city of Severodonetsk, you have 
heard about—it is about right here— 
has fallen to the Russian forces after a 
months-long battle in the last couple 
of weeks. 
Its twin city, Lysychansk, which is 
also in this region, has also fallen, 
completing Russia’s brutal conquest of 
what is called the Luhansk region. So 
Donetsk is still partly in Russian con-
trol—partly not. Luhansk is now in 
Russian control. 
But it is important to remember this: 
Russia paid dearly for every inch of 
Luhansk—by the way, much of which 
they 
flattened. 
They 
literally 
de-
stroyed before occupying it. They lost 
troops, and they lost military equip-
ment. 
But, significantly, because taking 
this area required massive amounts of 
resources from Russia, it drew atten-
tion away from the north—Kharkiv, as 
we saw, and down here in Kherson. 
So it enabled these brave Ukrainian 
forces in these other places to make 
progress, not just to hold out against 
the overwhelming Russian onslaught 
but to make progress. The Russians 
have now announced they are in an 
‘‘operational pause,’’ meaning they are 
claiming they are going to stop their 
large-scale offenses until their soldiers 
have rested. 
But as in the past, they can’t be 
trusted. And, in fact, small-scale offen-
sive missile strikes and rocket attacks 
continue all along this front line. 
We also must not downplay even 
what these sporadic strikes can do. 
Consider the tragedy that occurred 
about 2 weeks ago at a shopping mall 
in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. 
This is in central Ukraine, the area we 
just talked about. 
As more than 1,000 innocent Ukrain-
ian civilians shopped with their friends 
and families at this shopping mall, a 
Russian strategic bomber launched a 
large Kh-22 missile. Now, this is a long- 
range, nuclear-capable missile that was 
initially designed to destroy aircraft 
carriers—aircraft 
carriers—and 
they 
shot it into the middle of a shopping 
mall—turned it into a burning inferno. 
You can see here in this photograph. 
As a result of the explosion and the 
fire, 20 people were killed immediately, 
and more than 50 were wounded. Doz-
ens more were declared missing. We are 
still getting the final numbers from 
this horrific tragedy, but it occurred 
during the summit of the so-called G7. 
That is the group of developed coun-
tries, larger economies—Japan, United 
States, and a few European countries— 
who were meeting to talk about the 
issue of Russia and Ukraine, among 
other things. The G7 rightfully con-
demned this atrocity as ‘‘an abomi-
nable attack,’’ an attack on civilians 
in a shopping mall. 
Just yesterday evening in Chasiv, 
Chasiv Yar, which is a residential town 
in eastern Ukraine, a Russian rocket 
attack struck an apartment complex 
and killed at least 15 people. More than 
20 people are believed to be trapped in 
the rubble as emergency workers con-
tinue to work today to be able to free 
those who were trapped, to try to res-
cue innocent civilians who are under 
attack. Again, this is an apartment 
complex. People are trapped inside it, 
even as we talk. 
These barbaric, cowardly, long-range 
missile attacks on civilian targets 
have to be condemned by all of us, but 
they have to be stopped in two ways. 
One is by providing Ukrainians what 
they need in terms of anti-aircraft, 
anti-missile technology, but also by 
giving the Ukrainians the ability to 
use these longer-range missiles them-
selves. 
Right now, the Russians can sit back 
with impunity and launch these at-
tacks. I join the people of Ukraine in 
mourning for the loss of these innocent 
civilians at the hands of Russia’s cru-
elty. The terror, by the way, that is 
caused by these attacks is not an acci-
dent. It is part of the Russian war plan, 
to cause terror. Striking civilian tar-
gets is certainly one thing they are 
doing. Continuing to blockade those 
Black Sea ports I talked about is an-
other one, increasing the economic 
cost of this war on the Ukrainian peo-
ple. 
This is one reason why, by the way, a 
couple of weeks ago just before we left 
for the recess, we had a vote in the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
on a resolution to name Russia as a 
state sponsor of terrorism. That passed 
on a bipartisan basis, and my hope is 
that it comes here to the floor of the 
U.S. Senate, so we can all go on record, 
again, condemning what is going on 
over there and making it clear that 
Russia has become a pariah country, 
that this is not normal behavior, even 
in the tragedy of war. 
Striking civilian targets deliberately 
is, unfortunately, continuing day in 
and day out. 
In response to these brutal acts, the 
bravery 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Ukrainian defenders has been impres-
sive but not surprising. Think about it. 
They are defending their families. 
They are also defending freedom, de-
fending their homeland. The stakes of 
this war are high, and the fate of a sov-
ereign country hangs in the balance. 
But I will say today, it is not just 
about Ukraine, as important as that is. 
It is bigger than that because, if Presi-
dent Putin is successful in taking more 
of Ukraine than he already controls— 
let’s see the map again. 
If he does, in fact, expand beyond 
what he has already done, taking Cri-
mea, taking this area of Luhansk and

Donetsk, taking the southern part of 
Ukraine, he is not going to stop there. 
I don’t think anybody believes that or 
is so naive to believe that. 
In 2016, he stated, ‘‘The borders of 
Russia never end.’’ This was after he 
attacked Ukraine the first time. That 
was in 2016. 
In a speech claiming victory in May 
of this year, President Putin painted 
Ukrainians as Nazis. Remember, the 
President of Ukraine is Jewish. His 
family went through the ordeal of the 
Holocaust. 
But he was painting Ukrainians 
somehow as Nazis, saying that the in-
vasion of Ukraine was inevitable and 
that he was forced into this conflict by 
NATO. NATO is not an offensive asso-
ciation; it is strictly defensive. 
The disinformation and lies also 
come from those around him. Vladimir 
Medinsky, one of President Putin’s 
senior advisers, lamented that Russia’s 
territory was greatly diminished from 
the time when Moscow controlled more 
than 14 currently independent nations, 
including Finland and Poland. This ter-
ritorial retreat ‘‘is not forever,’’ he 
said. 
Europeans are waking up to this one- 
time unimaginable threat. According 
to a European Council on Foreign Rela-
tions opinion poll conducted 2 months 
ago, a possible Russian invasion of 
their nation is seen as one of the top 
three threats now by 53 percent of 
Swedes, 54 percent of Romanians, and 
40 percent of Germans. I was just in 
Romania a few weeks ago and got to 
hear from Romanians directly about 
this concern. 
I also went to Moldova, where there 
is even more of a concern because there 
is 
a 
Russian-occupied 
area 
called 
Transnistria right along their country. 
So what can be done to stop and re-
verse the Russian gains here in the 
east? The most important issue to me 
is to help these brave Ukrainians be 
able to defend themselves by giving 
them the weapons to level the playing 
field with Russia so they are not con-
stantly outgunned. 
I have heard this from President 
Zelenskyy. We have all heard it from 
Russian forces that they are making 
some progress in the east because they 
have these weapons, these missiles, and 
the Ukrainians do not. 
We also heard about this from mem-
bers of the European Parliament who 
came here to visit us about 3 weeks 
ago, came to the Ukraine Caucus. We 
talked about the caucus earlier. We 
also heard from some fighter pilots 
who came about 2-and-a-half weeks ago 
and met with our Ukrainian Caucus. 
What they need are the weapons to be 
able to respond. 
Their words have been explicit and 
direct: Russian artillery outguns theirs 
in terms of range, in terms of accuracy. 
They can sit back and fire on the 
Ukrainians’ military and civilian tar-
gets, and the Ukrainians cannot re-
spond. 
They 
cannot 
reach 
them. 
Ukraine needs advanced Western rock-
et artillery systems to even those odds. 
Thankfully, the United States and 
several of our allies have these exact 
systems. The UK has some systems. 
Germany has some systems. Over the 
past month, the United States has pro-
vided Ukraine with several of what are 
called HIMARS or high mobility artil-
lery rocket systems. 
We have got hundreds of these in our 
inventory, by the way, and many of 
which are not with active units, in 
other words, they would be available. 
These are superior to Russian artillery 
in almost every way: mobility, reload 
time, accuracy, and most importantly, 
range. And yet, during Ukraine’s hour 
of need, we continue to move too slow-
ly. 
In the initial tranche of HIMARS, 
say about 6 weeks ago, only four of 
these units were announced. They are 
now in service, as we understand it, 
and they are working. Four more were 
announced a few weeks ago, and an-
other four were announced this past 
Friday. Reports are these are still in 
transit. They are not yet being used to 
protect these Ukrainian civilians who 
are being bombed. 
They need more, and they need them 
now. Several have come from Germany 
and from the UK; but they need more, 
and they need them now. 
How many do they need? It depends 
who you talk to, but the Ukrainian 
military officials who have spoken out 
on this, who are the experts, say they 
need at least 48 of these systems to be 
able to begin to turn the tables in the 
east. The United States is now com-
mitted to 12; only 4 are definitely in 
place. We need to move faster. 
Apparently, there was a lot of discus-
sion within the Agencies, within the 
White House, about whether to do this 
or not; that is what took longer for 
these HIMARS to be approved. My view 
is we have had the dialogue. These sys-
tems are no more escalatory than Jav-
elins were or other weapons. These are 
defensive weapons. These are the abil-
ity for Ukraine to defend itself, and I 
hope we can continue to provide them 
and move more quickly. They are 
working. They are proving their worth. 
Let me show you a photograph of 
what HIMARS can do to Russian logis-
tics. These are images of Russian am-
munition dumps exploding after report-
edly being struck by missiles from a 
HIMARS system. Previously, Ukraine 
could not reach these munition dumps, 
but now with HIMARS, they can. 
Striking these ammo dumps can have a 
devastating impact on Russian forces. 
These are depots of weapons that are 
behind the Russian lines but in the 
country of Ukraine. And, finally, they 
can access them. Striking them is 
going to have a devastating impact. 
According to Serhii Kuzan, the chair-
man of the Ukrainian Security and Co-
operation Center in Kyiv, Ukraine has 
used HIMARS rockets to now destroy 
20 warehouses of Russian artillery am-
munition. 
As I said earlier, Russian soldiers are 
currently in an ‘‘operational pause’’ to 
recover and resupply before future of-
fenses, so they say, but they cannot re-
supply without ammunition. 
So destroying these hubs will set 
Russia’s 
timetables 
back 
and 
buy 
Ukraine more time to prepare and to 
receive more Western military equip-
ment like the HIMARS. 
These pictures are exactly the proof 
we need to show that what we are send-
ing is now making a difference. Imag-
ine what they could do if they had 
enough to be able to truly push back. 
These HIMARS systems arrived in 
Ukraine too late to avoid some of the 
damage that we have been talking 
about today and, certainly, some of 
these cities, like Severodonetsk we 
talked about that has now fallen to the 
Russians or Lysychansk, which has 
fallen to the Russians. 
They arrived too late for the thou-
sands of brave Ukrainians who were 
killed and wounded defending those 
cities. If we don’t act quickly, then fu-
ture HIMARS rockets will arrive too 
late to save more Ukrainian citizens, 
more Ukrainian soldiers, more Ukrain-
ian innocents. Time is of the essence, 
and I urge the administration not to 
delay. 
Again, I am pleased they are getting 
those weapons in. I wish it had been 
sooner. And we now have to encourage 
more and faster. 
When people, understandably, ask 
about our support for Ukraine, our tax-
payer-funded aid to the tune of billions 
of dollars, they deserve to know that 
their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are 
being spent wisely. 
In my view, that means spending it 
on weapons like HIMARS that are ac-
tually making a difference on the bat-
tlefield. I believe the aid that we and 
our allies are providing is a wise in-
vestment that will pay dividends over 
time, but let’s provide them the right 
aid. 
Ukrainians are defending their coun-
try with bravery and skill, exceeding 
all expectations, and they are ensuring 
that their country is not being handed 
over to President Putin. We have to as-
sure them that the United States and 
their allies are doing all we can to help 
them save their country. 
We know that making any territorial 
concessions to Russia would only em-
bolden President Putin and other fu-
ture would-be conquerors. The lesson 
that they would learn is that with 
enough patience they can wear down 
the West and get what we want. 
So I was pleased to see 2 weeks ago, 
when the leaders of the so-called G7 
countries—again, U.S., Japan, Euro-
pean countries—stated: 
We will continue to provide financial, hu-
manitarian, military, and diplomatic sup-
port and stand with Ukraine for as long as it 
takes. 
We saw how territorial concessions in 
the late 1930s only increased Nazi Ger-
many’s appetite, and this is clearly no 
different. 
Russia’s goals are not limited to just 
the Donbas or southern Ukraine. Presi-
dent Zelenskyy clearly understands 
this. He said to CNN recently:

Ukrainians are not ready to give away 
their land, to accept that these territories 
belong to Russia. This is our land. 
I could not agree more. In fact, it 
goes beyond Ukraine. President Putin 
will conquer as much of the former So-
viet empire as we let him. We must 
stop him here in Ukraine. 
With regard to sanctions, the EU is 
still using Russian oil and gas, sending 
roughly $870 million a day to help fund 
the Russian war machine. 
We have the capacity here in the 
United States to help our partners and 
shore up our domestic energy produc-
tion—not only important for Ameri-
cans to get the cost of gas down with 
more supply, but also critical for our 
allies. 
We are seeing some small progress, 
but much more needs to be done to re-
duce this reliance on Russian energy. 
By the end of this year, we expect coal 
and oil to be phased out. The United 
States must do its part and increase 
our energy production, while at the 
same time be a leader in developing 
new energy technologies that can help 
reduce emissions and increase national 
as well as global security. 
This is not either or. It should be all 
of the above. We should be producing 
what we need right now to ensure that 
Europe can stop its dependency on Rus-
sia and sending this almost a billion 
dollars a day to fund the war machine, 
but at the same time we should be pro-
ducing energy from all sources, includ-
ing green energy, including nuclear en-
ergy. 
And like sanctions and military aid, 
when the United States leads, the 
world tends to follow. But most impor-
tantly, our allies and enemies watch 
us. 
This is true with regard to a revived 
NATO right now. In fact, in the wake 
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as we 
talked about earlier, both Sweden and 
Finland have applied to join NATO, 
shrugging off long histories of neu-
trality. 
In Brussels, NATO Ambassadors, on 
July 5, signed the accession protocols 
that put them a step closer. Now, all 30 
NATO nations will review their appli-
cations for ratification. Canada, Esto-
nia, Denmark, Norway, and Germany 
have already ratified Finland and Swe-
den’s applications. Let’s join them. 
Let’s do it this week. Let’s do it 
through an expedited procedure and 
just get it done. I look forward to vot-
ing in favor of those applications in 
committee and on the floor. 
We cannot forget that Russia has 
claimed 
this 
war 
started 
because 
Ukraine wanted to join NATO. Of 
course, they did. They reaffirmed that 
in 2014 when they threw off a corrupt 
Russia-backed government. They are 
looking westward to Europe, to us, to 
freedom, to democracy. They want to 
join NATO and the European Union and 
form ever-closer bonds with the trans-
atlantic community. 
I have long believed that NATO de-
served a NATO membership action plan 
to provide a clear path to eventual 
NATO membership, and they have 
made significant progress in doing this. 
This brutal invasion is just Russia’s 
latest attempt to throw that progress 
off course. We must not be deterred. 
Now, as we enter the fifth month of 
this war—I have come down here every 
week to talk about it—we have seen 
the resilience and the fortitude of the 
Ukrainians. Even as their brothers and 
husbands go to fight for the homeland, 
the women of Ukraine are incredibly 
brave as well, and I have seen them at 
the border with Poland; I have seen 
them at the border with Moldova; and 
I have seen them as they come to the 
United States and talk about what is 
going on in their country. They know 
this is the fight, during our generation, 
where democracy is on the line. How 
this war develops will have far-reach-
ing impact on the entire globe. 
In Ohio, I see this all the time. A 
couple of weeks ago, I was in Cleveland 
for what was called ‘‘Amplify the 
Voice: A Benefit Concert for Ukraine.’’ 
We had 1,000 people come to this beau-
tiful Severance Hall, which is the 
music center for the Cleveland Orches-
tra, and one of the premier orchestras 
in the world, by the way. They made 
the center available to the Ukrainian 
Bandurist Chorus to perform to, again, 
an audience of people who were Ukrain-
ian Americans but also from every na-
tionality, particularly the nationali-
ties communities, as we call them in 
Cleveland, which would be people from 
Eastern and Central Europe who under-
stand the importance of this fight. So 
Lithuanians were there; Poles were 
there; Romanians were there; Hungar-
ians were there—people from all over 
the region. 
The concert raised funds for the 
United 
Ukrainian 
Organizations 
of 
Ohio’s Fund to Aid Ukraine. They are 
doing great work. 
It is amazing how many people who 
spoke who are doing something to help 
with regard to Ukraine—medical sup-
plies, armored vests, helping with re-
gard to emergency supplies just so peo-
ple can have enough food to get by 
when they are subject to some of these 
bombings we have seen today. 
We also heard a beautiful concert. 
Ukrainians of all stripes certainly un-
derstand what is going on and why this 
is so important and have for a long 
time because they know what it is like 
to 
live 
under 
the 
thumb 
of 
authoritarianism. They broke away 
from it many times during their his-
tory and again more recently in 1991 
and again in 2014. 
I was in Ukraine after the Revolution 
of Dignity in 2014, where Ukrainians 
decided for themselves that they want-
ed to turn away from Russian domina-
tion and turn to us. 
I believe we can help them win this 
time. I am confident of it. That is why 
I have introduced a bipartisan resolu-
tion with Senators Manchin, Mur-
kowski, and Hassan to recognize the 
U.S. 
commitment 
to 
help 
rebuild 
Ukraine. According to the United Na-
tions Human Rights Council, more 
than 7 million civilians have fled their 
homeland, and there has been about 
$600 
billion 
worth 
of 
damage 
to 
Ukraine’s infrastructure. 
By the way, those refugees, those ci-
vilians whom I have met—they all 
want to go home. And in a sense, it is 
not perfect to call them refugees be-
cause they are really just Ukrainians 
who are temporarily forced to leave 
their country, but they all want to go 
home and rebuild Ukraine. 
It is not just a human toll we see 
captured in images and videos, but peo-
ple’s homes and livelihoods have van-
ished overnight. So they are going to 
need help. The countries of the free 
world are with us, and we have to be 
sure that they step up, including some 
countries that were less comfortable 
providing military assistance that are 
providing more monetary assistance— 
some of those countries are really 
going to need to step up in terms of 
helping to get Ukraine back on its feet. 
Now is not the time for us to back 
away. We have to be able to win this 
militarily and then begin the rebuild-
ing. It is not a time for us to be ten-
tative or equivocal. At this critical 
juncture, let’s lead our allies to provide 
what Ukraine needs to protect their 
homeland and to defend democracy. 
I yield the floor.

E705 
July 11, 2022 
RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF STEVEN MATTSON 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the retirement of a longtime 
public servant, Steven Mattson of Lyme, Con-
necticut. Steven officially retired from his role 
as First Selectman of Lyme on July 5, 2022, 
given the end of the town’s fiscal year. Initially 
appointed in 2017, Steven has dutifully filled 
the role of Lyme’s highest official for three 
elected terms. 
Steven has served the town of Lyme in mul-
tiple capacities for 27 years since he first 
moved with his family to Connecticut in 1996. 
This not only includes his tenure as First Se-
lectman, but also an additional 17 years on 
the Board of Selectmen as well as positions 
on just about every other board and commis-
sion available in town. A small enclave of 
Connecticut and the larger New England re-
gion, with a local population hovering around 
2,300, municipalities like Lyme rely on the 
leadership example set by Steven, who has 
acted as a knowledgeful public steward who 
could be trusted to advocate for the town’s 
long-standing interests. He and the small but 
effective team at Lyme townhall have kept the 
municipal government operating like a well- 
oiled machine, working sharply to keep the 
community in strong financial shape without 
having to ask more of its constituents, and en-
hancing the locality’s capacity for financial 
planning. 
A bipartisan figure in the town of Lyme, Ste-
ven’s impact has reached beyond admin-
istering the basic duties of a municipal govern-
ment. Under his tenure as both Selectman 
and First Selectman, Lyme has been led by a 
watchful eye and bolstered by extensive finan-
cial planning, undergone a successful ref-
erendum toward the reconstruction of its 
school system, enhanced communications be-
tween the townhall and the public at large and 
experienced invaluable infrastructure improve-
ments. Within the community, there is also a 
weighted value toward expanding the con-
servation of the town’s small, historic, and en-
vironmental culture through its own public 
trusts and open spaces which Steven has un-
doubtedly continuously supported. In June 
2022, Sustainable CT, a Statewide organiza-
tion that uplifts inclusive, resilient and efficient 
municipal governance, recognized the leader-
ship of Lyme and bestowed the town with its 
bronze certification. Clearly, the town of Lyme 
has benefitted from Steven’s leadership. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure and an 
honor to represent constituents like Steven 
and his wife Maddy, who have committed a 
significant portion of their lives to the under-
appreciated necessity that is responsible gov-
ernance. I had a chance to see his devotion 
to his family back in 2014, when his daughter 
Carly worked on one of my election cam-
paigns. She, like her parents, is a personable, 
public-spirited citizen who did fantastic work 
interacting with coworkers and voters. Her par-
ents were extremely proud of her efforts, 
which were a great reflection of their values 
and empathy for people. As Steven retires to 
appreciate more time with his family, his long-
standing presence in the public eye of the 
Lyme community will be sorely missed. And 
though the void left behind by his departure 
will be difficult to fill, it is worth emphasizing 
the impact of his legacy and great standing in 
which he leaves the town of Lyme. To that 
end, Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in recognizing 
the accomplishments of Steven Mattson’s per-
sonal contributions to the town’s future and 
congratulating him on his well-earned retire-
ment.

IN MEMORY OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ALEXANDER JEFFERSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
recognize the late Lieutenant Colonel Alex-
ander Jefferson, a World War II Tuskegee Air-
man and one of Michigan’s most decorated pi-
lots as we honor his memory. 
Jefferson’s remarkable and heroic service 
figures prominently in our nation’s history. He 
was considered to be one of the ‘‘original’’ 
Tuskegee Airmen, which drew heavily from 
Michigan and were the U.S. Army’s first Black 
Air Corps. Jefferson served as a P–51 fighter 
pilot with the Red Tails, 332nd Fighter Group 
301st Fighter Squadron in Ramitelli, Italy. His 
unit bravely escorted bombers into action, pro-
viding critical protection from enemy aircraft 
without losing a single plane. 
Jefferson was captured as a prisoner of war 
on August 12, 1944, three days before the in-
vasion of Southern France, after he was shot 
down while firing at German radar stations on 
the coast. Presumed dead, he was held for 
more than nine months. He was liberated by 
Patton’s 3rd Army on April 29, 1945. 
After the war, Jefferson served as an instru-
ment instructor in advanced flight training at 
the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama, con-
tinuing the storied Air Corps’ legacy of excel-
lence in flight. He was discharged from active 
duty in 1947 and retired from the reserves in 
1969. In his civilian life, Jefferson worked as 
an elementary school science teacher in De-
troit, where he would retire as an assistant 
principal in 1979. Jefferson served as a mem-
ber of various church, educational, and alumni 
organizations, as well as being one of the 
founders of the Detroit Chapter of the 
Tuskegee Airmen. He was a member of the 
Tuskegee Airmen Speaker Bureau, a life 
member of the Silver Falcon Association, and 
has served as an Admissions Counselor for 
the U.S. Air Force Academy. 
He has received numerous awards and ac-
colades for his bravery and his selfless service 
for our country, including the Purple Heart 
Award. He represented the best of Detroit. We 
have lost a great American patriot, a hero, and 
a Detroiter who should always be remembered 
for his service to freedom for our country. He 
may be gone from our sight, but never from 
our hearts. May his soul rest in peace.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF GLEN-
DA GLOVER AS INTERNATIONAL 
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ALPHA 
KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY, INC. 
HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the service of Dr. 
Glenda Glover, Ph.D., JD, CPA, as Inter-
national President and CEO of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. As a proud mem-
ber of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incor-
porated, I could not have asked for a better 
person to lead our more than 320,000 Sorors 
spread over at least 1,046 chapters from all 
over the world through the last four years. 
Dr. Glover was born in Memphis, Ten-
nessee the daughter of a civil rights activist 
and raised in the Civil Rights Movement. She 
graduated from Tennessee State University, 
an illustrious Historically Black College and 
University, before getting her MBA at another 
incomparable HBCU, Clark Atlanta University, 
proving that, truly, Atlanta Influences Every-
thing. Not yet satisfied, she moved to Wash-
ington, D.C. and obtained a Ph.D. in Econom-
ics from George Washington University and a 
law degree from Georgetown University. 
Professionally, Dr. Glover is a star. She 
spearheaded the creation of the country’s first 
HBCU-based Ph.D. program in business at 
Jackson State University, and chaired the De-
partment of Accounting at Howard University’s 
School of Business. She has been a leader in 
the private sector, and currently serves as the 
President of her beloved alma mater, Ten-
nessee State University, since 2013. Dr. Glov-
er is not just the President either: she was the 
Thurgood Marshall College Fund’s HBCU 
President of the Year in 2018, and HBCU Di-
gest’s 2019 Female President of the Year. 
Dr. Glover did all of that while maintaining a 
leadership role in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
Incorporated. Initiated into the Alpha Psi 
Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incor-
porated at Tennessee State University, where 
she served as President and Vice-President 
as an undergraduate. Dr. Glover has also 
served as President, Vice-President, and 
Treasurer of Beta Delta Omega Chapter of 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated in 
Jackson, Mississippi before moving up to 
International 
Vice-President, 
International 
Treasurer, and Treasurer to the Educational 
Advancement Foundation (EAF) of the entire 
Sorority.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E706 
July 11, 2022 
Since assuming the International Presidency 
and CEO role in 2018, Dr. Glover has led our 
Sorors powerfully to sustain us through the 
pandemic, and raised our voices on critical 
issues like Voting Rights and Black Maternal 
Health—ensuring that Sorors of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority, Incorporated are the VOICE of 
the movement, not the ECHO. Dr. Glover’s 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Congressional Women’s 
Roundtable continues to lead the charge to-
ward solutions to create a better world for fu-
ture generations by fighting for continued, 
meaningful investments in HBCUs, a com-
prehensive approach to ending the maternal 
health crisis in America, and protecting our de-
mocracy through safeguarding and expanding 
voting rights. 
Dr. Glover has convened meetings with our 
Soror, Vice-President KAMALA HARRIS, to bring 
our community’s needs to the highest level of 
our government, and is the Vice-Chair of 
President Joe Biden’s HBCU Advisory Board. 
I and every Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, In-
corporated Soror, am indebted to Dr. Glover 
for her service to our Sorority. She is a living 
pillar of Black Excellence, and her leadership 
has and continues to lift up successive gen-
erations of Black leaders. As we celebrate her 
enduring legacy, her enriching sisterhood, and 
her exemplary service, let’s remember the pur-
pose that has animated her to succeed and to 
bring her community up with her.

HONORING THE CAREER OF LEE A. 
LUFT 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the extraordinary career of 
a dedicated and highly impactful public serv-
ant in the State of Connecticut and the U.S. 
Coast Guard, Information Technology Spe-
cialist, Mr. Lee Luft. After nearly 43 years of 
diligent service in the U.S. Coast Guard, Lee 
retired on March 1, 2022. His retirement is to 
be honored at the United States Coast Guard 
Academy Officer’s Club on August 12, 2022. 
Born and raised in Connecticut, Lee grad-
uated from Wilcox Regional Vocational Tech-
nical High School in 1976, certified as an elec-
trician. Lee continued his studies in that trade 
at Hartford State Technical College in 1979, 
graduating with an Associate in Science De-
gree in Electronics and Technology. That 
same year, Lee changed career paths and 
pursued a new vocation, joining the U.S. 
Coast Guard’s Research and Development 
Center (RDC) as a Digital Computer Mainte-
nance Worker. For those who are not familiar 
with the center, it is the hub of Coast Guard 
operational analysis and mission execution so-
lutions, located in the Fort Trumbull section of 
New London, Connecticut. The center is re-
sponsible for testing and evaluation in all the 
mission areas of the Coast Guard, including 
maritime law enforcement, environmental pro-
tection, and national defense preparedness, to 
name a few. During Lee’s tenure, the work of 
the R and D Center was constantly evolving, 
as the mission requirements of the Coast 
Guard changed. The 9–11 attack on our 
homeland, the rising challenges of climate 
change, the increase in human trafficking and 
drug smuggling at sea all occurred on Lee’s 
watch. Like the entire team at the center, Lee 
was deeply involved in the Coast Guard’s 
need to competently respond to new roles 
which hinged on highly functional information 
systems—his area of expertise. He remained 
at the RDC for a total of more than 39 years, 
advancing all the way to the role of Informa-
tion Technology Specialist by the early 2000s. 
As a reflection of his ambitious nature and de-
sire to improve his skill, it is also worth noting 
that Lee completed his Bachelor of Science 
degree in Computer Science from the Univer-
sity of New Haven in 1999. 
Lee’s service extended to several other sec-
tions of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). From 
RDC he transitioned to USCG Command Con-
trol, Communications, Computers, and Infor-
mation Technology (C4IT) Service Center 
Business Operations Division. He was later re-
assigned to C5ISC and specialized in Archi-
tecture and Engineering Standards. Lee was 
known to not back down from a challenge 
while at the Coast Guard, including the sev-
eral opportunities he took up to represent both 
the Coast Guard and our Nation as Technical 
Delegate for the United States National Com-
mittee of the International Electrotechnical 
Commission in many places in and out of the 
country over his career. 
As someone who began their career with an 
electrician apprenticeship, Lee has moved up 
the ranks to become a nationally and inter-
nationally recognized presence, representing 
the United States on shipboard network stand-
ardization and communication protocols used 
by all types of Marine Electronic Equipment. 
Lee has been a significant player in the devel-
opment of the USCG Nationwide Differential 
GPS (NDGPS), as well as a principal in the 
design and development of the USCG Nation-
wide AIS Client/Server architecture, and all 
AIS interface and network protocols. He has 
been bestowed several awards for his innova-
tive research, including the Hammer Award 
from former Vice President Gore for his role in 
the development of the Differential Global Po-
sitioning System and a Civilian Service Com-
mendation Medal for his work at the Coast 
Guard RDC between 1979 and 2018. 
Madam Speaker, Lee’s contributions to the 
U.S. Coast Guard and the effectiveness of our 
Nation’s strategic communications are im-
measurable. His life’s work is clearly deserving 
of an equal amount of gratitude. His life and 
career, dedicated to public service, exist as an 
inspiration to those who follow in his footsteps. 
Although his retirement from the U.S. Coast 
Guard undoubtedly leaves large shoes to fill, 
we are grateful that the U.S. Coast Guard will 
continue to receive his support in retirement. 
To these ends, I ask my colleagues in the

CELEBRATING 
THE 
300TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
PRAIRIE 
DU 
ROCHER, ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 300th anniversary of Prairie du 
Rocher, Illinois. 
Three centuries ago, French settlers estab-
lished roots along the Mississippi River, where 
an open prairie stretched from near the river’s 
edge to tall limestone bluffs. 
They called the settlement Prairie du 
Rocher—‘‘Prairie of the Rock.’’ It once rep-
resented the western boundary of the United 
States; and it still stands as one of the finest 
historical and architectural examples of French 
Colonial Heritage in the United States. 
Here they tilled the soil and built their 
homes, caring for their families, their commu-
nity, and their land. Traditions, celebrations, 
and their social fabric have held fast to this 
day. In its tricentennial year, Prairie du Rocher 
seeks to preserve the historical significance of 
this city. In such a fast-moving, ever-changing 
world, it’s more important than ever that we 
treasure such a unique past, as it moves for-
ward in today’s world. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating 300 years of Prairie du Rocher. May 
there be many, many more.

OBSERVING THE LOSS OF JOSEPH 
SHELTRY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the loss of a dedicated patriot, 
Lieutenant 
Commander 
(LCDR) 
Joseph 
Francis Sheltry of Gales Ferry, Connecticut. A 
patriot at heart, LCDR Sheltry struck everyone 
he met with his sincere, personable and en-
thusiastic character. He led a distinguished ca-
reer and fulfilling life prior to his untimely 
death on August 7th, 2020—a week before his 
58th birthday. He is to be interred at Arlington 
National Cemetery this August, bearing us 
with a new opportunity to honor his memory. 
Born in 1962 to Claire and Joseph Sheltry, 
Joseph was raised in Boston. From an early 
age, his parents instilled in him the value of 
service to one’s community and Nation. Imme-
diately upon graduating Dominic Savio Catho-
lic High School in 1980, it was with those 
ideals in mind that Joseph enlisted in the 
Navy. It would just so happen that in that 
same inaugural year of service with the Navy 
that Joseph met his life partner and wife of 37 
years—Lorraine—while working as a hospital 
corpsman for the National Naval Medical Cen-
ter in Bethesda, Maryland. 
It wasn’t long until Joseph and Lorraine 
married in 1983. Soon after that, in 1985, Jo-
seph was selected for the Enlisted Commis-
sioning Program and went on to receive a 
Bachelor of Science in Chemistry as the 
Honor Graduate from the University of Idaho. 
From there, he was selected for the Nuclear 
Propulsion Program and served on the USS 
Lafayette and the USS Kamehameha. Under-
standing the value of continuing education, Jo-
seph returned to school following these de-
ployments and received his Master of Science 
in Electrical Engineering from the Naval Post-
graduate School in California in 1994, followed 
by a second master’s degree just a few years 
later. 
Armed with such an extensive background, 
Joseph was assigned as the Navigator on the 
USS Grayling, where he deployed out of Grot-
on, Connecticut. At this point in time, Joseph 
and Lorraine were ready to establish more 
permanent roots with what was by then a 
growing family. Just a day before his deploy-
ment, they moved into their first home in the 
neighboring village of Gales Ferry, Con-
necticut, with their two children, Jaclyn and 
Erica. It was within those few short years that 
LCDR was attached to Commander Sub-
marine Group 4 Norfolk. Madam Speaker, it is 
worth emphasizing, however, that the nature 
of Joseph’s life story was an interwoven, duti-
ful balance between family and service to 
one’s country, as the naval officer could not 
help but return home to stand by his wife’s 
side as their third child, Leah, came into the 
world. 
Their family full, these central, dual tenets of 
service for LCDR Sheltry reverberated through 
the remainder of Joseph’s vibrant life. After 21 
years of service with the Navy, LCDR Sheltry 
officially retired in August 2001. Just about a 
month into retirement though, he was stirred 
back to action following the September 11th 
attacks and heeded the call of our Nation in 
mourning, stationing at U.S. Naval Forces 
Central Command Bahrain. He remained dedi-
cated to the strength of our Navy following his 
tour in Bahrain, returning to his family in Gales 
Ferry while picking up work at Electric Boat in 
the neighboring town of Groton, Connecticut. 
From there, LCDR Sheltry transitioned to the 
Naval Undersea Warfare Division Newport as 
the Sensors and SONAR Systems Department 
Head until his passing nearly two years ago. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rep-
resent constituents, who, exemplified by Jo-
seph Sheltry, are constituted by such selfless 
devotion. Joseph’s work had a direct impact 
on the betterment of our Nation’s security, 
and, despite such an early passing, his con-
tagious bright personality continues to live on 
through all those who knew him—particularly 
his family: surviving him are his wife Lorraine, 
three daughters, mother, siblings and ex-
tended family. He had such a genuine attitude 
and motivation to his aura, which he always 
purposed toward uplifting those around him. 
His positive force will not soon leave us. To 
these ends, I ask that my colleagues in the 
House join me in honoring LCDR Joseph 
Francis Sheltry, a committed servicemember, 
father, husband and shipmate, whose resolute 
loyalty acts as an example to us all, setting his 
name into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD as his 
final place of rest at Arlington National 
Cememtery is prepared for him. 
HONORING LANCE CPL. EVAN 
STRICKLAND 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of 19-year-old Lance 
Cpl. Evan Strickland of Valencia County, New 
Mexico. On June 8, he was tragically killed 
during an Osprey helicopter crash at a training 
exercise near San Diego, California. Lance 
Cpl. 
Strickland 
graduated 
Valencia 
High 
School in 2020, where he made an immense 
impact on his fellow peers. 
He chose to serve our nation honorably in 
the United States Marine Corps within the 3rd 
Marine Aircraft Wing as a tilt-rotor crew chief. 
Lance Cpl. Strickland will be remembered for 
his good-hearted personality, kind character, 
and calling to serve our nation. My deepest 
condolences are with his family, friends, and 
loved ones during this extremely difficult time. 
While he will be deeply missed by our nation 
and our communities across New Mexico, we 
will be forever grateful and remember Lance 
Cpl. Strickland.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM FLYNN, 
JR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of William Flynn, Jr, who passed 
away on Saturday, June 18, 2022, at the 
young age of 87. 
Bill was born on December 10, 1934, in 
Philadelphia, PA, the son of William Flynn, Sr. 
and Rose Flynn (Rossillo). He was proud of 
his Irish-Italian upbringing in South Philadel-
phia. Bill’s family moved to Natrona, Pennsyl-
vania, after WWII. During the Korean war, 
while attending St. Vincent’s College he had 
enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in Ger-
many, while stationed there he got his first 
taste of life in Europe. When he returned to 
the states he would enroll at Youngstown Col-
lege for engineering, he joined the fraternity 
Alpha Phi Delta. While attending college he 
married his high school sweetheart, Anne 
Sebak. 
In 1963 he was hired by Packard Electric as 
an engineer, and the family moved to Warren, 
OH. Bill would work in many different capac-
ities while there, and made many lifetime 
friends there as well. Bill and Anne and family 
were a staple of the Northeast Warren neigh-
borhood, where neighborhood kids were wel-
comed as their own, which would be a theme 
throughout Bill’s life. He had so many hobbies 
and things that he loved to do, and with each 
came along an entire group of good friends 
and he enjoyed all of their company. Hunting, 
sailing, wine making, tennis and his MG. 
He was a gifted but humble artist. He spent 
many summers at Mosquito Lake sailing at the 
Cortland Conservation Club, and enjoyed the 
banter of the Panera crew. He could be seen 
cruising around in his MG with Elmo riding 
‘‘shotgun.’’ Nothing meant more to him then 
spending time with friends and family. Sadly

Anne would pass in 1996, and Bill would later 
retire from Packard. A few years later, Bill 
would be reenergized when he remarried Ar-
lene Boyle (McNicholas), and Bill would wel-
come her children as his own. The two would 
spend many summers enjoying the Poconos 
at her cottage on Long Lake. 
To carry on Bill’s memory he leaves behind

son William Flynn, III (Mariella Fraijia) of War-
ren, OH, a daughter Tara Breuer (Herm) of

lon Grace Ferraro, Chase Ferraro and Jack

in-laws, nieces and nephews and cousins. 
Through research it was determined that Bill 
was the ‘‘Greatest Grandpa Ever’’ this was 
verified by a T-Shirt and a coffee mug. 
He was preceded in death by his parents, a 
sister Geraldine Flynn, his wife Anne, and his 
second wife Arlene.

OBSERVING THE PASSING OF 
BRUCE MACDONALD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the loss of dedicated commu-
nity leader, Bruce MacDonald of New London, 
Connecticut. Mr. MacDonald, a devoted hus-
band and father, passed away at the age of 
78 on June 1, 2022, after a courageous battle 
with cancer. 
Born just down the road from New London 
in Westerly, Rhode Island, in 1943 to Lemuel 
and Margaret MacDonald, Bruce was raised in 
a household that placed value on community 
service. Eager to understand and experience 
the larger world and serve his country, he en-
listed in the Army before even graduating high 
school. 
Upon the conclusion of his service, Bruce 
returned home to Rhode Island and enrolled 
at Johnson Wales College earning an associ-
ates degree. An easygoing, curious man at 
heart, he found his true calling as a news re-
porter. As someone who was never known to 
take the larger picture for granted, Bruce had 
a passion for advocating for the most dis-
advantaged. As a newsman, this meant that 
he became quickly known for disseminating a 
broader perspective and a sense of empathy 
amongst the public, crafting thoughtful, enlight-
ening stories about groups of people living 
through hardship. A powerful, friendly voice for 
the powerless, Bruce took on career roles at 
several radio stations in Westerly, Rhode Is-
land; Norwich, Connecticut; and Hartford, Con-
necticut before becoming an influential voice 
in newspapers, including The Norwich Bulletin, 
Groton News, The Day of New London and 
USA Today. His prodigious work and ubiq-
uitous presence, made him a well-known, 
trusted media personality in much of South-
eastern New England. 
A man of adventure, Bruce still had a strong 
appreciation for the fundamentals of life. While 
reporting for The Day newspaper, Bruce met 
a colleague who would become the love of his 
life, Gail Braccidiferro. They married in Gail’s 
getaway state, Vermont, in 1986, and soon 
after were grateful to bring a daughter, Cara, 
into the world. Family in hand, multiple worlds 
of opportunity collided for Bruce at that point 
in his life, as they then traveled to and lived 
outside of Washington, D.C., for a short stint 
while he worked on the World Wise Schools 
project for the US Peace Corps. While an ex-
citing opportunity for Bruce, this was of course 
just one of many worldly-travel experiences for 
the family. Upon their return to Connecticut, 
Bruce transitioned to a new career in public 
media relations for community stakeholders 
within the region, first the Mashantucket 
Pequot Tribal Nation and then the Eastern 
Connecticut Chamber of Commerce. 
Through both the nurturing of his family and 
informing the public, the capacity of Bruce’s 
devoted nature was seemingly endless. There 
are further examples of Bruce’s dedication, 
however, which existed through service to his 
community. From an early age, this included 
volunteering for the ambulance corps and Civil 
Air Patrol and running for local offices in his 
hometown. This penchant for community serv-
ice followed him for the entirety of his life and 
throughout 
much 
of 
southeastern 
Con-
necticut—in 
both 
the 
coastal 
towns 
of 
Stonington and New London in which he lived, 
he was known for his active involvement in 
both communities and the region as a whole. 
In New London, his longtime adopted home, 
he was locally known to have volunteered at 
the Homeless Hospitality Center, served as a 
board member of the Thames River Heritage 
Park Foundation, a representative on the 
Eastern Connecticut Tourism Board, an orga-
nizer of the Connecticut Maritime Heritage 
Festival and an active member of the New 
London Rotary Club. The list goes on and on. 
Even into his final years as he charged into a 
battle with cancer, he served his hometown of 
New London undeterred as Secretary to the 
local Town Committee. 
Madam Speaker, though we mourn his loss, 
the brightness that Bruce emulated into our 
lives will not part from us easily. Hardships 
were never able to defeat his unyielding opti-
mism or his dedication to his community. And 
so, in an equal amount of respect toward 
Bruce and what his life meant for the town, we 
will not be overcome by the hardship that is 
his loss. His lasting impact will be remem-
bered by thousands—particularly his surviving 
family, namely, his wife Gail and daughter, 
Cara, of Middletown, Connecticut, who lovingly 
stayed by his side during his illness. I had the 
honor and privilege to hire Cara in my con-
gressional office for a number of years, and 
through her, got a chance to know Bruce in 
his role as a parent and a keen advisor on 
issues of the day. He was beloved by my en-
tire staff over the 16 years I have served in 
congress. While his legacy will not soon be 
forgotten, it is most proper that we extend his 
memory as a prime example of service to 
one’s community and country. To that end, I 
ask that this chamber joins me in observing 
the passing of Bruce MacDonald, further set-
ting his name and character into the perma-
nence of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
