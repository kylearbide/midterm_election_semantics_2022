GUN VIOLENCE RUINS LIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
‘‘My husband was shot in the stomach 
during a robbery attempt in front of 
our house. Gun violence ruined his life. 
He was left with grievous residual inju-
ries that have put a huge dent in my 
family’s finances, emotions, sense of 
security, and our well-being. My family 
has suffered a lot, but most especially 
my husband, who has suffered both im-
paired emotional and physical bodily 
function. He has so many medical 
issues as a result of his shooting. We 
have experienced pain and suffering 
like so many more families out there. 
There is horrible residual pain left be-
hind by gun violence. We have become 
prisoners in our own home.’’ 
‘‘My younger brother took his own 
life with a handgun he legally ob-
tained. He had a long history of mental 
illness, and I disagreed with his ability 
to purchase a firearm for this very rea-
son. If there had been better back-
ground checks in place, he may not 
have been able to purchase the firearm. 
I wish that these restrictions were in 
place. I want you to know that real 
stakes are involved in a simple issue 
like background checks. If universal 
background checks were in place, my 
little brother might still be alive.’’ 
‘‘My fiance’s son, James, was shot 
and killed in 2018 after attending a get- 
together. He was not the intended tar-
get. He was a straight-A student in his 
senior year of high school, trying to de-
cide if he was on his way to college or 
the Navy. But he didn’t get a chance to 
make his choice. There were nearly 100 
witnesses, but no arrest has been 
made.’’ 
‘‘I am a trauma therapist working 
with young children who have been ex-
posed to violence. These children are 
under the age of 5. Through play, they 
have demonstrated their experience 
with the sounds of gunfire. Some have 
even seen deceased people outside their 
front door. There is even less funding 
provided to address the trauma that 
gun violence produces for the most vul-
nerable—our children—who are living 
in the most violent areas.’’ 
These are just a handful of the more 
than 700 stories about the devastating 
impacts of gun violence that my con-
stituents have recently shared with 
me. Each of these stories is heart-
breaking, and they highlight both the 
complexity and the far-reaching con-
sequences of the gun violence epidemic. 
Every single day in my district and 
communities across the country, chil-
dren are traumatized by the sounds of 
unpredictable gunfire, the sight of 
blood on pavement, or more ambulance 
lights in their neighborhoods. 
Families are becoming financially 
ruined by the cost of continued sur-
geries and therapy after being shot. 
Grandparents write to tell me that 
their elementary school-aged grand-
children are scared to go and play out-
side for fear of being gunned down like 
their classmates and their neighbors. 
When will enough be enough? 
America’s gun violence epidemic is a 
slow-motion massacre that is rapidly 
gaining speed. Just this weekend, 77 
people were shot in Chicago, 77 people 
in just one city in just one weekend. 
We must act now to stop the steady 
drip of daily gun violence. Mr. Speaker,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3244 
June 29, 2021 
2020 was one of the deadliest gun vio-
lence years on record, and we are al-
ready on track to outpace those grim 
statistics. More than 21,000 people are 
dead in just the first 6 months of this 
year. 
We need to step up to the plate and 
do something to protect our constitu-
ents. 
We need to make straw purchasing 
and gun trafficking Federal crimes. We 
need to expand background checks. We 
need to support more evidence-based 
community violence prevention pro-
grams. We need to build opportunity 
for youth to get a good education and 
good jobs. We cannot go on letting 
mothers bury their children. 
This week, we mark the end of Gun 
Violence Awareness Month. But for far 
too many families, there is no end to 
this month of awareness and advocacy. 
These families are painfully aware of 
the impacts of gun violence because 
they carry the weight of this epidemic 
with them every single day. 
I rise to implore my colleagues to ex-
ercise some courage and responsibility 
by advancing gun violence prevention 
legislation. 
f 
MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, a quick web search on the 
meaning of Independence Day will give 
you the dictionary definition: A day 
celebrating the anniversary of national 
independence. 
For a nation built upon the founda-
tions of freedom, such as the United 
States of America, there is much more 
to the meaning of Independence Day 
than can be described in a dictionary. 
For Americans, Independence Day is 
about the people who have lived and 
died in the defense of freedom. Crispus 
Attucks, who was killed by British 
troops in the Boston Massacre, has 
long been honored as an American hero 
and the first casualty of the Revolu-
tionary War. Mr. Attucks has proved to 
be the first in a long legacy of Amer-
ican heroes. 
Each and every generation of Ameri-
cans has had their share of men and 
women willing to pursue a more perfect 
realization of that most basic of human 
rights, freedom. 
Freedom against tyranny was the 
primary motive during the Revolu-
tionary War for our first President, 
George 
Washington, 
alongside 
the 
Founding Fathers, who designed the 
government for our new Nation and the 
troops who fought for its right to exist. 
The great efforts of President Abra-
ham Lincoln during the most trying 
time in our Nation’s history, the Civil 
War, led armies of brave soldiers who 
fought not only for the reunification of 
the country but also the freedom of 
people held in slavery. 
This noble fight was taken up not 
only by soldiers but by civilians who 
worked in support of those in combat, 
such as Clara Barton, Army nurse and 
founder of the American National Red 
Cross. 
Hundreds of thousands of young men 
lost their lives during the Second 
World War fighting fascism in Europe 
and 
around 
the 
world. 
Presidents 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry 
Truman, alongside generals including 
Eisenhower, Patton, and MacArthur, 
provided the leadership and strategy 
necessary to allow our soldiers to gain 
victory and preserve freedom. 
As a nation, we have believed in and 
fought for freedom for so long that it 
can easily be taken for granted. This is 
a trap that we must be extra vigilant 
not to fall into. As President Reagan 
aptly stated, freedom ‘‘is not passed to 
our children in the bloodstream.’’ 
Pursuing freedom for over 200 years 
has been the result of a conscious 
choice, in each era, by every genera-
tion. We must continue to make that 
choice in this era and in this genera-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, you may have noticed 
that in my examples from the Revolu-
tionary War, Civil War, and Second 
World War, I named politicians who 
served our soldiers and citizens. Make 
no mistake, it is the soldiers and the 
citizens of our Nation who do the work 
to preserve freedom. Therefore, it is 
the solemn duty of those of us who 
work in government to lead and rep-
resent the people so that they can con-
tinue to live in freedom. 
I urge each and every government of-
ficial, and especially my fellow Mem-
bers of Congress, to make the choice to 
pursue freedom, as so many genera-
tions have before us. In this way, we 
honor the lives of past heroes such as 
Crispus Attucks and ensure freedom 
will be defended by future generations. 
Mr. Speaker, that is the meaning of 
Independence Day that could never fit 
in a dictionary. 
f 
HONORING HEROES GORDON 
BEESLEY AND JOHNNY HURLEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, on 
June 21, 2021, the community of Ar-
vada, Colorado, experienced a tragedy. 
In a matter of minutes, our community 
lost two heroes, with dozens of Arvada 
residents left stunned and horrified. 
Arvada Police Officer Gordon Beesley 
was responding to a report of sus-
picious activity in Olde Town Arvada 
when he was ambushed and shot by a 
man who had immense hatred toward 
the police. 
Minutes later, a Good Samaritan 
named Johnny Hurley intervened and 
shot the suspect, undoubtedly saving 
countless other lives. In a tragedy upon 
a tragedy, Hurley was then mistaken 
as the shooter, and he was killed. 
Officer Gordon Beesley joined the Ar-
vada Police Department in 2002 and 
served in a number of roles for the de-
partment. He spent most of the year 
working as a school resource officer at 
local schools in our community, in-
cluding Oberon Middle School, Lincoln 
Academy, and Excel Academy Charter 
School. During the summers, he often 
returned to patrol work, as he was 
doing last Monday in Olde Town Ar-
vada. 
Officer Beesley was a well-known and 
well-liked member of our community. 
His calm, gentle, and patient demeanor 
made a big difference in his day-to-day 
interactions with students, especially 
those students who needed it most. 
In 2015, he was named employee of 
the year by the city of Arvada after the 
city learned Officer Beesley was riding 
his bike to school multiple times a 
week with a student who suffered from 
developmental delays and was not able 
to ride by himself. 
Countless other stories have surfaced 
from students, his colleagues, and com-
munity members in the days following 
his death about the impact he had on 
their lives, big and small. 
He was an accomplished drummer 
and singer who played in local Arvada 
bands Railbenders and Brethren Fast. 
We will remember Officer Beesley’s 
kindness and bravery and the approach 
he brought to life each and every day 
to ‘‘make someone feel special today.’’ 
Hearing 
gunshots, 
another 
hero 
stepped up to protect and defend the 
community, 40-year-old Denver resi-
dent Johnny Hurley. According to Ar-
vada’s chief of police, Johnny’s actions 
were ‘‘decisive, courageous, and effec-
tive in stopping further loss of life.’’ 
Johnny’s friends and family remem-
bered him as an idealist and iconoclast 
and were not surprised to learn Johnny 
stepped up to defend his community in 
a time of need. 
The loss of Johnny Hurley is tragic. I 
join the Arvada Police Department and 
our community at large in honoring 
his bravery for his actions that day, 
which undoubtedly saved lives. 
Although we don’t know all the facts, 
our hearts go out to the officer who 
mistook Mr. Hurley for the shooter. 
This has been a difficult week for our 
community, including for members of 
the Arvada Police Department. Our he-
roes in uniform are charged with pro-
tecting our communities, and last 
week’s shooting is a reminder of the 
dangers our police officers face each 
and every day across the country. 
Olde Town Arvada is a close-knit 
community at the heart of Arvada. On 
a typical day, it is a busy, vibrant, 
cheerful part of town. Mr. Speaker, 
June 21, 2021, was a dark day for our 
community, and it is difficult for many 
of us to process it. 
My deepest and heartfelt condolences 
go out to the families of Officer 
Beesley and Johnny Hurley and the en-
tire Arvada community. Arvadans are 
resilient and strong. Together, we will 
get through this.

June 29, 2021 
COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, there is no 
denying that Congress must take ac-
tion to improve our Nation’s crumbling 
infrastructure. But, sadly, bipartisan 
negotiations have hit a roadblock, and 
the infrastructure legislation on the 
floor this week is a go-at-it-alone, my- 
way-or-the-highway bill. 
Instead of focusing on traditional in-
frastructure, Democrats have chosen to 
prioritize the left’s Green New Deal 
agenda. This bill includes an estimated 
$276 billion for Green New Deal-related 
mandates, requirements, and programs. 
To put that into perspective, $1 out of 
every $2 spent by this legislation is 
tied up in Green New Deal goals. 
Further, this bill reduces flexibility 
for States to meet their own unique in-
frastructure needs and fails to stream-
line major project reviews, which typi-
cally face a 6-year delay. To make mat-
ters worse, the spending increases pro-
posed in this bill rely heavily on more 
deficit spending. There are no pay-fors, 
which will only further fuel inflation 
and increase the cost of goods like gas 
and food. 
We need commonsense solutions that 
truly work to improve our roads, 
bridges, railways, and rural broadband. 
I am pleased to hear that there are bi-
partisan 
negotiations 
underway 
to 
achieve these goals, but this bill this 
week veers off the road and into a par-
tisan ditch. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
later this week on H.R. 3684.

b 1015 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ANNE 
SEATON 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the life and legacy of Anne 
Seaton, who went to be with the Lord 
on April 23, 2021. 
Anne was a pillar of the Sixth Dis-
trict of Virginia, but her light shone 
well beyond the valley. 
Charitable at heart, Anne and the 
Mehnert family served as missionaries 
in Jamaica and hosted refugees from 
New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 
to help provide comfort and aid to 
those afflicted. 
In the valley, Anne was a passionate 
supporter of Grace Christian School 
and Wilson High School, as well as one 
who helped fundraise for the Waynes-
boro Symphony Orchestra. 
Further, Anne was active in local 
politics, including the successful cam-
paign of her husband Scott to the Au-
gusta County Board of Supervisors. 
Anne was the founder of the Repub-
lican Women of Greater Augusta and 
inspired many to get involved in the 
community. 
Above all, though, it was Anne’s fam-
ily and her faith that defined her. A 
loving 
wife 
to 
Scott, 
mother 
to 
Joscelyn Hodge and her husband Chris-
topher, Phillip, Samuel, and Daniel, 
friend and daughter, Anne was a de-
voted follower of Jesus Christ and was 
a member of Tabernacle Presbyterian 
Church. 
Anne has a grandchild due in Decem-
ber. 
Anne not only believed in her faith, 
but she lived it as exemplified through 
her life’s work. 
Living through our faith is a lesson 
we can all learn from the late great 
Anne Seaton. 
Anne is greatly missed and will not 
soon be forgotten. 
RECOGNIZING AMHERST COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL 
GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Amherst County High 
School girls softball team for winning 
this year’s Class 4 State Championship. 
It was a defensive game all around, 
and Amherst County’s pitcher, Dylan 
McNerney, kept the Lancers in it with 
an incredible performance, striking out 
10 batters. 
With the game tied at zero at the end 
of regulation, it took extra innings for 
the Lancers to pull off a victory 
against the Hanover Hawks. 
Before the final inning began, head 
coach Samantha Thacker told the 
team: ‘‘This is our time, this is our in-
ning, we have got to stay settled and 
be patient,’’ and they did just that. 
In the top of the eighth, two errors 
by the Hawks put runners on base for 
Amherst County with one out. 
When Kayleigh Combs stepped up to 
bat, she put the ball into play, and an 
overthrow allowed Cheyenne Wall to 
race home from third giving the Lanc-
ers a one to nothing lead. Soon after, a 
wild pitch brought Maegan Lloyd home 
adding another run to the board. 
With a two to nothing lead heading 
into the bottom of the eighth, the 
Lancers were able to keep the Hawks 
scoreless, securing the team’s first ever 
State softball title. 
Congratulations to the players and 
coaches on a great season, they have 
earned it. 
f 
WATER ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the importance of water and 
my concerns with the Biden adminis-
tration’s unnecessary overreach. 
We use water to sustain ourselves; 
for industrial manufacturing; for swim-
ming and recreation with our family 
and friends; to bathe; and to produce 
the most affordable, abundant, and safe 
food supply in the world. 
Agriculture is the largest industry in 
Kansas’ Big First District and across 
the State, so water conditions deter-
mine good or bad crop years, the 
amount of time livestock producers 
spend hauling water or moving cattle 
to land with a better pond, and ulti-
mately, the kinds of foods that show up 
on the grocery store shelves across the 
country. 
In western and south-central Kansas, 
the Ogallala aquifer is the main source 
of water and represents the supply of 
one-third of the State of Kansas. The 
Ogallala covers about 175,000 square 
miles across eight States from South 
Dakota to Texas, making it the largest 
aquifer in the country and one of the 
largest in the world. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, 
States began pumping water from the 
Ogallala to irrigate the land for agri-
cultural production use. In arid cli-
mates like western Kansas, irrigation 
transformed the Dust Bowl ridden re-
gion into the incredibly productive 
land that we see today. On average, 
Kansas has about three million irri-
gated acres with nearly 2.6 million 
acres irrigated with water from the 
Ogallala and the rest of the High 
Plains aquifer. The Ogallala’s ground-
water is essential to our food supply, as 
it supports nearly one-fifth of all of the 
wheat, corn, cotton, and cattle pro-
duced in the United States. 
In 2018, when I was Lieutenant Gov-
ernor of Kansas, we worked with the 
Ogallala 
Water 
Coordinated 
Agri-
culture Project to hold the first ever 
Ogallala Aquifer Summit in Garden 
City and gathered stakeholders from 
the eight States covering the aquifer to 
discuss the need to conserve water and 
sustain the Ogallala region’s agri-
culture productivity over the long- 
term, adapting new technologies and 
voluntarily reducing water waste. 
Since then, producers like Lynn 
Goossen have made changes to their 
operations to reduce the amount of 
water they pump and protect Ogallala. 
Goossen Farms has shifted from irri-
gated corn to a wheat rotation, adapt-
ed conservation practices when apply-
ing fertilizer, and changed from flood 
to sprinkler irrigation. Understanding 
the depletion of the Ogallala caused 
Mr. Goossen to take on leadership 
within his Groundwater Management 
District and work with other producers 
to voluntarily use their water wisely. 
Efforts at the State level in Kansas 
through 
Groundwater 
Management 
Districts have also supported the sus-
tainable use of the Ogallala aquifer 
where districts work with communities 
to set their own water conservation 
goals and control measures; develop 
plans to reduce water withdrawals in a 
designated area; and continue using 
water in a manner that is economically 
viable. The research from the North-
west Kansas Technical College Water 
Technology Farm has helped producers 
like Tim Franklin in Sherman County. 
The Franklin family farm was early to 
enroll in a Water Conservation Area, 
and uses the technology developed and 
tested at Northwest Tech to help meet 
their water reduction goals. 
These voluntary, locally led efforts 
to safeguard our water were supported 
during the Trump administration when 
they published a reasonable and clear 
definition of ‘‘waters of the United

States’’ in the Navigable Waters Pro-
tection Rule. This rule provided cer-
tainty for farmers and ranchers, and 
designated authority back to States to 
regulate their own waters after years 
of Federal overreach. 
Unfortunately, President Biden has 
once again determined that the Federal 
Government knows best and announced 
his intent to review the rule, likely sig-
naling a return to the Obama adminis-
tration’s WOTUS rule, which sought to 
Federally regulate every small stream, 
ditch or puddle of water. This an-
nouncement is especially frustrating as 
many western States currently face an 
extreme drought, leading to a severe 
water shortage for not only our agri-
culture producers, but also drinking 
water and hydroelectric energy genera-
tors. Further regulation adds insult to 
injury. 
Producers and water users at the 
local level know their community best, 
which is why I joined several of my 
House colleagues on legislation that 
would codify the Navigable Waters Pro-
tection Rule and on a letter to Presi-
dent Biden stating our strong opposi-
tion to any return to the expanded 
Federal 
jurisdiction 
over 
waters 
around the country. I have also led leg-
islation that would push back on exec-
utive overreach in our agriculture, en-
ergy, and natural resource sectors. 
Our farmers and ranchers are the 
original conservationists and contin-
ually update practices to reduce water 
use and inputs so that they can con-
tinue to produce safe, affordable food 
while maintaining their water supply 
for generations to come. We must pro-
vide certainty regarding their local 
water rights and continue to stand in 
opposition to any overreaching regula-
tions that threaten the livelihoods of 
Kansas farmers and ranchers.

RECOGNIZING CHARLES JACKSON 
FRENCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise 
to 
recognize 
Charles 
Jackson 
French, a World War II hero with ties 
to Omaha who made one of the most 
underappreciated sacrifices in Amer-
ican military history 
The story of Charles Jackson French 
is an American story: One of courage, 
sacrifice, and hope. Charles, a Black 
man, was born in a racially segregated 
Foreman, Arkansas, on September 15, 
1919. In 1937, Charles enlisted in the 
United States Navy. After completing 
his enlistment, he moved to Omaha, 
Nebraska, to be with family, but after 
the attack on Pearl Harbor, he reen-
listed. 
According to accounts, on September 
5, 1942, Petty Officer First Class French 
was serving as a mess attendant in the 
racially segregated USS Gregory. As a 
Black man growing up in 1930’s Arkan-
sas, Charles lived in a time when seg-
regation laws prohibited Black people 
from swimming alongside White people 
in public pools and beaches, yet when 
the USS Gregory was attacked and 
sunk by Japanese gunfire off the coast 
of Guadalcanal, it was Petty Officer 
French who dove into the treacherous 
waters of the Pacific to save his fellow 
sailors who had been wounded. 
Petty Officer French loaded 15 of his 
fellow sailors into a lifeboat and saved 
his injured comrades from drowning. 
However, Charles knew that they could 
not simply float to shores controlled 
by the Japanese where they would 
meet a fate worse than death. Pris-
oners were often tortured then exe-
cuted. Military.com recounted how 
Charles tied a rope around his waist 
with the help of his shipmates and 
towed his fellow sailors through shark- 
infested waters for 8 long hours until 
they were finally identified and saved 
by an American landing craft. 
In his book ‘‘Black Men and Blue 
Water’’ Chester Wright recounted his 
conversation with Petty Officer French 
who told him that when he and the raft 
full of survivors were rescued, persons 
aboard the ship told Charles to go 
‘‘where the colored boys stay’’ while 
the crew tended to the wounded White 
survivors. Charles further shared that 
the sailors rescued by him told the 
crew: ‘‘He ain’t going nowhere. He is a 
member of the Gregory’s crew and he 
damned well will stay here with the 
rest of us.’’ 
Just like the sailors who stepped up 
at the time for French, it is our time 
to stand up and recognize with full 
measure the sacrifice and service of 
French, whose story has been under-
appreciated by the Navy and history. A 
real-life hero like Charles must be rec-
ognized by the military and the coun-
try that he devoted his life to. 
In World War II, the Navy gave 
French a commendation letter. I have 
now asked the Navy to review and con-
sider upgrading to a medal, and the 
Navy is reviewing this now. 
Full recognition of U.S. Navy Petty 
Officer First Class Charles Jackson 
French is long overdue. We owe it to 
Charles, his family, and to the millions 
of 
Americans 
who 
learned 
from 
Charles’ story. 
Last Friday, I also introduced legis-
lation to rename one of Omaha’s post 
offices after Charles, and I am pleased 
that Representatives JEFF
FORTEN-
BERRY and ADRIAN SMITH have joined 
me in this effort to recognize a Ne-
braska hero. 
Today, I call on the Navy, Congress, 
and the White House to recognize the 
service and sacrifice of Petty Officer 
First Class French so that all Ameri-
cans, especially our Nation’s future 
leaders and servicemembers, can be in-
spired by Charles’ display of patriotism 
and sacrifice. But also, so the family of 
Charles can be comforted by the eter-
nal gratitude of a Nation that Petty 
Officer First Class French so dutifully 
served. This three-decade veteran sa-
lutes him. 
RECOGNIZING 
NORTH 
CAROLINA 
SWEET 
POTATO 
COMMISSION’S 
60TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the North Caro-
lina Sweet Potato Commission’s 60th 
anniversary. 
In 1961, six sweet potato producers 
chartered the commission to support 
growers and to maintain North Caro-
lina’s standing as a leading sweet po-
tato producing State. They are now 
more than 400 sweet potato growers 
strong as well as packers, processors, 
and business associates who remain 
dedicated to supporting our State’s 
prosperous sweet potato industry. 
Since 
1971, 
North 
Carolina 
has 
ranked as the number one sweet potato 
producing State in the U.S. with 65 per-
cent of the Nation’s sweet potato pro-
duction. North Carolina sweet potato 
producers are family farmers who have 
been cultivating their land for genera-
tions growing many different crops. 
They work day and night, year after 
year to ship delectable, high quality, 
nutritious North Carolina sweet pota-
toes all across the country and the 
world. 
Agriculture is the backbone of North 
Carolina’s economy, and the sweet po-
tato industry is absolutely critical to 
our food supply in North Carolina and 
in the country. It is not an understate-
ment to say that the North Carolina 
Sweet Potato Commission has more 
than fulfilled its founding mission to 
strengthen our State’s sweet potato 
production, and I congratulate them on 
their 60th anniversary. 
May they have many more years of 
providing every American with one of 
our Nation’s safest, nutritious, and 
might 
I 
add, 
delicious 
vegetables 
grown. 
CONGRESS MUST AGGRESSIVELY ADDRESS THE 
NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, our na-
tional debt exceeds $28.1 trillion. Con-
gress year after year continues spend-
ing money with seemingly no regard 
for the debts we are pushing onto fu-
ture generations. While it was nec-
essary to spend a significant amount of 
money to get us through the COVID–19 
crisis, we must now move aggressively 
to address the national debt, in my 
opinion, the most significant domestic 
threat that our country faces. And the 
sooner we take action the better. 
b 1030 
Unfortunately, the current adminis-
tration doesn’t seem to feel the need to 
pursue 
fiscal 
restraint. 
President 
Biden’s spending agenda is hurting 
families and small businesses across 
the country. Meanwhile, he has sent 
Congress a $6 trillion budget request. 
This additional spending will lead to 
even more inflation. The excessive 
spending Congress recently approved 
has already resulted in inflation. We

see it every day in the skyrocketing 
prices of goods. And if the President 
and Democrats in Congress get their 
way on major tax hikes, the economy 
and working families will be hurt even 
more. 
Today, the American dollar is still 
king, which is how we can print and 
borrow money with seemingly little 
consequence. But huge debt-to-GDP ra-
tios threaten that standing and could 
easily cause a significant decline in our 
standard of living. 
Rampant inflation, which is really 
just a hidden tax, and a significantly 
devalued dollar could cripple our econ-
omy and easily lead future generations 
right back to the days of centuries be-
fore us. 
Now, in contrast, the budget pro-
posed by the Republican Study Com-
mittee for fiscal year 2022 balances the 
annual budget in 5 years by reducing 
spending and maintaining pro-growth 
policies. It is the most pro-life budget 
ever written, with 17 pro-life provisions 
included. It protects Second Amend-
ment rights, secures our border, and of-
fers real solutions to return our coun-
try to fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republican Study 
Committee budget combats Washing-
ton’s out-of-control spending and puts 
American taxpayers first. We should 
all be able to agree it is long past time 
to bring fiscal sanity to Washington. 
f 
SUPPORTING OUR PARTNERS IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of legislation called 
the HOPE and ALLIES Act to support 
our interpreters in Afghanistan. 
I can’t tell you how important this is 
on a personal level to me. In 2012, I was 
hit by an IED blast. That IED went off 
because one of our interpreters stepped 
on a pressure plate. His name was 
Raqman. He was responding to a call, 
responding to do his job, like they do 
day in and day out. They never get a 
break. And he stepped on that IED, 
about 10 to 15 pounds of explosives, and 
it ripped off all four of his limbs right 
away. I couldn’t see him because I was 
blinded by the blast, but I could hear 
him. 
When someone gets hit by an IED— 
you have probably seen in the movies— 
you think they scream. But they don’t 
scream. They don’t have the energy to 
scream. It is more like a groan. It is 
the deepest kind of pain that you can 
imagine. And I will never forget that 
sound. 
Before he was hit, he expressed to us 
that one of his dreams would be to 
come back to San Diego, California, 
enlist in the military, and become a 
Navy SEAL. That was the kind of pa-
triotism that he had. He wasn’t even a 
citizen. Imagine if our own citizens 
loved their country the way that these 
guys did. 
And 
that 
story 
is 
not 
unique. 
Raqman later died, but that legacy 
lived on. These interpreters showed 
such dedication to the cause; it is un-
imaginable, really. And as military 
units rotate in and out, we get to go 
home, we see our families. The inter-
preters stay out there. It is just an-
other day for them. Meanwhile, their 
families are under threat. They are re-
ceiving anonymous phone calls con-
stantly, threatening their lives, calling 
them infidels all because they sup-
ported the United States. 
Now we are about to leave them. This 
administration is not doing enough to 
make sure that they don’t get left to 
die. I am confident this body will do 
what it can, but it takes this adminis-
tration to actually do something now 
before this hasty retreat occurs and be-
fore thousands and thousands and 
thousands of interpreters and contrac-
tors are killed; and they will be killed. 
They absolutely will be killed. Their 
families will be killed. The threats 
have already come, and it will happen 
if we don’t do something about it. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on this adminis-
tration to do something about it. I call 
on the Secretary of State and the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to get 
this process going, to expedite this 
process as quickly as possible. These 
people are heroes and they need to 
come to their new home here in the 
United States.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, in the aftermath of 
the disaster in Miami, Florida, we com-
mend to Your care and protection the 
ongoing search and rescue efforts. 
We fervently pray that You would de-
liver all those that are yet clinging to 
life beneath the magnitude of the 
wreckage. Preserve their spirits even 
as they struggle with overwhelming 
fear for their lives. Grant them a 
glimpse of hope—even a miracle—that 
they would soon emerge from the terri-
fying prison of panic and distress. 
And for the families of the missing 
and the dead, give them comfort and 
strength as they wait for an answer or 
grieve their loss. Even as they cling 
desperately to a photo or a memory, 
may they find a way to hold fast to 
their faith in You. 
Guide and strengthen the rescue 
workers who face the daunting task of 
digging through the concrete rubble 
and the devastation that surrounds 
them. May they have fortitude of body 
to brave the dangers of this precarious 
structure and fortification of faith to 
endure the suffering they attend to. 
On behalf of all of these we pray with 
the psalmist: In our distress, we call 
upon You O Lord; to You O God, we cry 
for help. Hear our voices. May our cries 
reach Your heavens. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the

NER) come forward and lead the House 
in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. WAGNER led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise as 
a tireless advocate for the most vulner-
able. I continue to fight for the Born- 
Alive Act to mandate lifesaving care 
for abortion survivors. And I also am 
proud to support H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act, which 
will permanently prohibit taxpayer 
funding for abortions by enshrining the 
bipartisan Hyde amendment into law. 
Sadly, both the Born-Alive Act and the 
Hyde amendment are under attack by 
my Democrat colleagues. 
The Hyde amendment protects tax-
payers from paying for abortions and 
has saved hundreds of thousands of 
lives. 
No one should be forced to finan-
cially support the abortion industry. I 
stand with the majority of Americans 
who believe in this essential conscience 
protection.

June 29, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-

tertain the request unless it has been

THE 
UNITED 
STATES-CANADA 
BORDER NEEDS TO SAFELY RE-
OPEN 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, for 34 years my community of 
Buffalo, New York, and our Canadian 
neighbors in Fort Erie, Ontario, would 
mark the first week of July with the 
Friendship Festival. 
This event that invites citizens of 
both countries to cross our shared bor-
der and celebrate with music, culture, 
food, and festivities highlights the 
strong and lasting bond between the 
United States and Canada. 
There will be no cross-border celebra-
tion this year on Canada Day and Inde-
pendence Day. Not due to the pan-
demic, but due to the failure of both 
countries to plan for a safe reopening 
of the U.S.-Canadian border. 
For friends and families living along 
the northern border, crossing isn’t an 
annual event, it is a way of life. 
Vaccines provide the bridge that al-
lows people to come together again. 
We need leadership to open those 
bridges and let us reunite. 
f 
THE ORIGIN OF COVID–19 MUST BE 
INVESTIGATED 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today on a matter that is incred-
ibly important to our national secu-
rity, our public health knowledge, and 
preparing for the next pandemic. 
It has been well over a year since the 
start of the COVID–19 pandemic, and 
our country has closed down in the face 
of a public health crisis the likes of 
which we have not seen in decades. 
And to this day, we still do not have 
a definitive answer regarding the ori-
gins of COVID–19. Getting to the bot-
tom of how this virus originated and 
how it spread across the globe should 
be one of our top priorities in Congress. 
Today, the Republican members of 
the 
Select 
Subcommittee 
on 
the 
Coronavirus Crisis will hold a forum to 
discuss the origins of this virus. This is 
not a partisan issue, and every Member 
of this body should want to know 
where this virus came from and every 
member of the select subcommittee 
should be in attendance. 
As I said earlier, finding the origins 
is important to our national security, 
public health knowledge, and preparing 
for the next pandemic. 
Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Ways 
and Means, and the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
H.R. 18, No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE A 
PRIORITY 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, President Joe Biden claimed 
a bipartisan agreement on infrastruc-
ture. On the surface this sounds like 
great news. Unfortunately, quickly fol-
lowing 
this 
new-found 
agreement, 
President Biden crushed the bipartisan 
bill by mandating wasteful Green New 
Deal borrowing, destroying jobs. 
Improving America’s infrastructure 
should be a priority and to delay it for 
partisan reasons is another insult to 
the American people. The President’s 
voters are misled with an absurd inter-
pretation of infrastructure. 
This chaotic mentality has been ex-
hibiting a reversal from the bipartisan-
ship President Biden promised when 
running 
for 
President. 
Dishonoring 
promises and undermining bipartisan 
negotiations, 
the 
administration 
should actually be focused on the needs 
of the American people instead of de-
stroying jobs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we should never forget September 
the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act, and I 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, the re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
JEFFERY ROBERT HALTER 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the life of Jeffery 
Robert Halter. Not only was he my 
neighbor and a family friend, but he 
was also a devoted husband to Kim, 
and director of constituent services for 
my congressional office. Additionally, 
Jeff was a loving father to Katherine 
Chelsey and Laura Leigh and sup-
portive father-in-law to Andrew Smith 
and Austin Lowe. 
Jeff was a proud Bowling Green, Ken-
tucky, 
native. 
He 
graduated 
from 
Bowling Green High School in 1983 and 
attended Samford University School of 
Pharmacy where he graduated in 1989. 
As a prominent pharmacist and owner 
of two community pharmacies, Jeff 
served many patients in the local com-
munity and was always happy to help 
his customers. He was also a member of 
Broadway United Methodist Church. 
Jeff’s contagious laugh and kindness 
will be remembered by all who knew 
him. He loved the outdoors, but above 
all, he loved his family. In addition to 
his wife and two daughters, Jeff is sur-
vived by his parents, Charles Robert 
and Scottie Ann Halter; brother, Tim-
othy Alan Halter; and many other lov-
ing family members. Jeff left a positive 
impact on our community and is great-
ly missed.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to protect the sanctity of human 
life, especially the lives of the unborn. 
The Hyde amendment has saved near-
ly 21⁄2 million lives since its first inclu-
sion in an appropriation bill in 1976. 
This historically bipartisan amend-
ment which prohibits the use of tax-
payer dollars paying for abortion is 
supported by a majority of Americans. 
H.R. 18, of which I am an original co-
sponsor, codifies the Hyde amendment 
and applies it to all government fund-
ing, cementing the protections for the 
most vulnerable Americans. This bill is 
called the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3249 
June 29, 2021 
for his induction into the University of 
North Carolina’s Order of the Golden 
Fleece, the oldest and highest honor 
society at UNC, where Mike received 
both a bachelor of arts and a juris doc-
torate. 
After graduating from UNC law, 
Mike practiced as an attorney in his 
hometown of Lumberton until he was 
elected to Congress in 1996. During his 
18 years representing Robeson County 
and other parts of southeastern North 
Carolina, Congressman McIntyre ac-
quired a reputation for excellent con-
stituent service and advocacy for rural 
communities, including his work on 
the Agriculture Committee and his co-
authoring 
the 
landmark 
Tobacco 
Buyout legislation, as well as fighting 
for full Federal recognition of the 
Lumbee. 
For Mike, country over party was not 
just a slogan, it was his approach to 
leadership. I am honored not only to 
carry on his work serving the rural 
southern Piedmont of North Carolina, 
but also to strive to emulate his exam-
ple as I do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mike on 
this appropriate recognition. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and

ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask

A BILL FOR BAD OPTICS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, after 
the 5-month deployment of the Na-
tional Guard around our U.S. Capitol, 
after the fact of the January 6 break- 
in, the bill has come due now of over 
half a billion dollars—$521 million—for 
the thousands of troops to guard this 
Capitol. 
This was, again, after the big break- 
in of January 6. Of course, had the de-
cisionmakers on hand here at the Cap-
itol with their security intel used 
ahead of time decided to employ just a 
handful of those troops, we wouldn’t 
have had the January 6 situation hap-
pen. But they did not want the bad op-
tics of armed troops standing in front 
here at that time. 
So, instead, we got 5 months’ worth 
of it with two rows of fence, razor wire, 
and the inability for the people to 
come visit their Capitol. So now we 
have months of those optics and a half- 
a-billion-dollar bill instead. 
Mr. Speaker, if that bill doesn’t get 
paid, now our National Guard will not 
be able to do their training and have 
their other readiness needs met be-
cause Congress hasn’t paid the bill for 
what they did not want ahead of time— 
bad optics. 
Instead, the taxpayers get the bad 
optics of that bill and a possibly deci-
mated National Guard. 
f 
BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, the Biden 
border crisis continues raging on our 
southern border. Cartels are getting 
rich, migrants are getting abused and 
assaulted, and Americans are becoming 
victims of crime. 
With the record number of illegal 
aliens attempting to flood across our 
border, what has the Biden administra-
tion done? 
Nothing. 
For months now, the Biden adminis-
tration has been denying this crisis ex-
ists; telling the American people there 
is no crisis; telling the American peo-
ple the border is closed. But we all 
know better. 
I saw it myself firsthand when I vis-
ited Del Rio, Texas, a place where 
every day, around 3:00 p.m., buses 
pulled up to the Mexican side of the 
border and unloaded hundreds of illegal 
aliens. They then wade through knee- 
high water of the Rio Grande and into 
our country. Once they arrive on the 
American side, they are promptly 
picked up by Border Patrol agents in 
air-conditioned vans, given a wrist-
band, and away they go to a city near 
you. 
This happens tens of thousands of 
times every single day and there is no 
end in sight, not until we revert to 
Trump’s policies. 
f 
DEFUND ABORTION 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
because, as a proud pro-life advocate, I 
cannot stay silent as I watch the Biden 
administration chip away at the rights 
of defenseless unborn. 
Democrats have been working over 
time with the Biden administration to 
roll back critical protections for the 
unborn so they can push radical pro- 
abortion policies, and their latest vic-
tim, it appears, is the Hyde amend-
ment. 
For over 40 years, the Hyde amend-
ment has saved millions of lives by pre-
venting the use of taxpayer dollars to 
fund abortions. A recent poll from the 
Knights of Columbus indicates that 58 
percent of Americans oppose the use of 
taxpayer dollars to support abortions. 
That number also includes 65 percent 
of Independents and 31 percent of 
Democrats. 
If millions of Americans are against 
the use of tax dollars being used to sup-
port abortion, then why is Congress 
considering legislation that does just 
exactly that? 
If this legislation were for the people, 
wouldn’t we listen to them instead of 
forcing American taxpayers to sub-
sidize something that the majority of 
them are against? 
Taking the life of an unborn child is 
simply unconscionable. I believe that 
we, as a governing body, have a respon-
sibility to protect life at every stage, 
especially the defenseless unborn who 
are unable to advocate for themselves. 
We have no business using taxpayer 
dollars to fund abortions.

LAMPETER-STRASBURG SOFTBALL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Lampeter-Stras-
burg High School softball team for win-
ning the PIAA 5A Softball Champion-
ship earlier this month, with a 10–7 vic-
tory over Armstrong. This is the Pio-
neers’ second State championship in 
just 3 years. This victory capped off a 
dominant 30-win season. 
Through the halfway mark, the Pio-
neers were down 1 run entering the 5th 
inning, but after putting 5 runs on the 
scoreboard, including a 2-run home run 
from senior Cam Byler, the game was 
over as the Pioneers closed out to 
claim the championship. 
Mr. Speaker, I extend congratula-
tions to the team members for their 
success this season. It is a great credit 
to the players, their hard work, Head 
Coach Gene Charles, the entire coach-
ing staff, that, for the past 3 years, the 
Pioneers have played in the champion-
ship game, bringing home the trophy 
this year and previously in 2018. 
Mr. Speaker, our community is real-
ly proud of this truly outstanding ac-
complishment. We wish the graduating 
seniors best of luck in their future en-
deavors.

DEFEND NOT DEFUND THE POLICE 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, crime 
rates spike when you give in to leftist 
demands and defund the police. It is as 
simple as that. Sadly, we are seeing 
this play out in major cities across the 
country. 
The New York Times reports a sam-
ple of 37 U.S. cities saw an 18 percent 
increase in murders in the first 3 
months of this year when compared to 
last. 
Mr. Speaker, this rhetoric and policy 
is dangerous and, worst of all, it is re-
sponsible for the dismantling and de-
moralization of police departments 
across the country. 
We have also seen the dramatic in-
crease on a tax against law enforce-
ment this year. Tragically, two of my 
constituents are among those who have 
recently been killed in the line of duty. 
We must have law and order and sup-
port our heroes who place their lives on 
the line to keep our communities safe.

In short, we must defend, not defund, 
the police.

INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in 
a moment, we are going to hear the 
rule coming forward to support the IN-
VEST in America Act. 
I applaud my friend and colleague, 
PETER DEFAZIO, for his tireless efforts 
to bring Federal transportation policy 
into the 21st century. 
Unlike past reauthorization bills, 
this legislation is centered around cli-
mate and equity. It makes historic in-
vestments in public transit and returns 
parity to the Federal share for transit 
and highways, while integrating bike- 
share and share micro-mobility into 
transit projects. It invests in Amtrak 
and high-speed rail, as well as biking 
and walking. 
Mr. Speaker, I am especially encour-
aged by the newly created Recon-
necting Neighborhoods Program, which 
will 
provide 
Federal 
funding 
for 
projects like Albina Vision in my com-
munity to rebuild underserved commu-
nities that have been negatively im-
pacted by past transportation deci-
sions. 
Mr. Speaker, by passing this legisla-
tion, my community and communities 
across the country will be made safer 
with the incorporation of my Vision 
Zero legislation. 
This is an unprecedented opportunity 
to deliver for our country, and we are 
ready to get this job done.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, right now, in 
Texas today, a little girl is being traf-
ficked in human trafficking and sex 
trafficking. That is occurring. She is 
going to be put into the sex trafficking 
trade and be abused, and she is going to 
be done so because we have allowed 
cartels to have operational control of 
our border. That is true. These are the 
facts. We know these are the facts. It is 
happening every single day. We see it 
on the ground. 
Yet the Vice President of the United 
States only found her way to go to El 
Paso as a pit stop on the way to Los 
Angeles, rather than actually meet 
with people in Texas to see what is ac-
tually going on in Texas. 
We have no funding at all for the bor-
der, for ICE, for Border Patrol. 
But you know what we have plenty of 
funding for? 
Abortion. Taxpayer funding for abor-
tion. 
It is absolutely despicable the values 
that are being presented in the United 
States House of Representatives and 
the people’s House. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
PTSD AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
this past Sunday, June 27, as National 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Aware-
ness Day; and June as National PTSD 
Awareness Month. 
We must do more to defy the stigmas 
surrounding mental health. National 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Aware-
ness Month is intended to raise public 
awareness 
about 
issues 
related 
to 
PTSD, reduce the stigma associated, 
and to help ensure those suffering re-
ceive proper treatment. 
Currently, about eight million people 
in the United States are struggling 
with PTSD. PTSD treatment is a cru-
cial tool that helps many individuals, 
particularly 
our 
Nation’s 
veterans, 
process, cope, and treat emotional and 
mental trauma. 
While PTSD can develop among any 
individual who faces a traumatic expe-
rience, it is often common in our serv-
icemen and -women. Many of our serv-
icemembers return home with injuries 
and scars, but in some cases it is the 
invisible scars that hurt the most. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
offers a variety of resources to help 
those suffering with PTSD. There are a 
wide variety of options, group meet-
ings, individual meetings, meetings via 
telemedicine. This ensures our vet-
erans can receive timely assistance 
wherever they may live. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our Nation’s 
veterans for their service, and I encour-
age those struggling with post-trau-
matic stress disorder to pursue treat-
ment.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 504, providing for 
consideration of H.R. 2662, the IG Inde-
pendence and Empowerment Act, under 
a structured rule. The rule provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, makes in order six 
amendments, provides for en bloc au-
thority, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3005 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion and provides one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in 
America Act. The rule provides 90 min-
utes of general debate with 60 minutes 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, and 30 minutes equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. It 
combines the Rules Committee prints 
for the surface transportation and 
clean water provisions of the bill, self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman DEFAZIO, and provides one 
motion to recommit. 
The rule additionally provides for 
consideration of H. Res. 503, Estab-
lishing the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol, under a closed 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Rules. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested rollcall votes on sus-
pension bills considered on June 28 or 
29, and this authority lasts through 
July 1. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a rule for four measures that 
address some of the most fundamental 
issues upon which Congress may act as 
we continually strive to form a more 
perfect Union, establish justice, ensure 
domestic tranquility, provide for the 
common defense, promote the general 
welfare, and secure the blessings of lib-
erty for all of us and our descendants. 
In passing these three bills and in 
creating a select committee to inves-
tigate the January 6 attack on the U.S. 
Capitol, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives is putting forward real solutions 
to repair our physical infrastructure, 
protect our systems of accountability, 
acknowledge our relationship with the 
past, and establish a shared under-
standing and plan to address the deep 
wounds inflicted upon this building, 
those who serve and protect here, our 
government, and our democratic Re-
public by the attack on the Capitol on 
January 6. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank 
the Members and committees that 
worked on the bills we consider here 
today, in particular, the Herculean ef-
forts by the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee and the Oversight 
and Reform Committee, and Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE, Majority Whip 
CLYBURN, and Majority Leader HOYER 
for their leadership to remove symbols 
of hate from the Capitol Building. 
Mr. Speaker, no one can deny that 
our Nation’s infrastructure is in a 
shameful state of disrepair. For dec-
ades, we have heard a lot of talk about 
infrastructure while efforts to build 
and maintain the networks and sys-
tems on which we all rely have been 
grossly underfunded. Whether it be 
roads and bridges or ports and rail 
lines, year after year, we fail to muster 
the political will to properly fund in-
frastructure, and the consequences are 
increasingly dire. 
My district, Pennsylvania’s Fifth 
Congressional District, is home to 
Philadelphia’s airport, port, rail yard, 
and, as a key part of the Northeast 
Corridor, dozens of miles of interstate 
highways and passenger rail lines, as 
well as regional commuter and light 
rail lines that link Philadelphia and its 
suburbs. 
True to its position, PA–05 sits as a 
transportation keystone to a vast 
interstate and international economic 
network. The problems facing my dis-
trict’s 
transportation 
infrastructure 
are not that different from those of 
other regions. Our infrastructure is

aging and, in some cases, beyond usa-
ble lifespan. It is heavily used, and 
State and local authorities don’t have 
enough money to meet maintenance 
needs, much less to make investments 
in modernization, expansion, or other 
improvements. Anyone who travels our 
roadways knows that axle-bending, 
tire-rattling potholes are the norm. 
Nationwide, the situation is no bet-
ter: aging and inadequate electrical 
grids, shamefully deficient water infra-
structure, 47,000 structurally deficient 
bridges. You can go to any congres-
sional district and find a litany of 
projects in desperate need of funding. 
We have heard lip service about in-
frastructure week for so long that it 
has become a sick national joke. We 
must act now. 
While the U.S. has sat on its hands, 
our allies and adversaries around the 
world have forged ahead with advance-
ments 
in 
transportation 
networks, 
from high-speed rail that puts ours to 
shame to building up broadband and 5G 
networks. 
China spends 8 percent of its GDP on 
infrastructure. Our European partners 
spend 5 percent of their GDP on infra-
structure. Here in the United States, 
we spend a meager 2.4 percent. 
We are falling behind the rest of the 
world and, in doing so, failing to pro-
mote the general welfare of our citi-
zens. 
That is why I am proud to support 
this rule to pass the INVEST in Amer-
ica Act. This bill will provide over $715 
billion over the next 5 years to repair 
and improve our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. It will create good-paying jobs 
and lay the foundation for robust eco-
nomic growth in the 21st century. 
It will make record investments in 
roads, transit, and rails, allowing State 
departments of transportation to ad-
dress maintenance backlogs and make 
forward-thinking investments in road 
safety, climate mitigation and resil-
iency, and low-income and underserved 
communities in our cities, suburbs, and 
rural areas. 
It will help build out our Nation’s EV 
infrastructure 
and 
help 
Americans 
shift to the next generation of clean 
energy vehicles. It will assist transit 
agencies in expanding service areas and 
adopting zero-emission vehicles, and it 
gives States funding to help prepare for 
the impacts of climate change and ex-
treme weather. 
This package also includes over $160 
billion for drinking water and waste-
water infrastructure. Right now in the 
United States, there are millions of 
Americans who don’t have access to 
clean drinking water or who aren’t 
connected to a wastewater network. 
There is no excuse for that. The water 
provisions include much-needed fund-
ing to fully replace lead pipes through-
out the country and strengthen water 
standards so the EPA can better ad-
dress PFAS contamination. 
These issues are vitally important to 
my district and others in southeastern 
Pennsylvania and across the country. I 
commend the Energy and Commerce 
Committee 
for 
crafting 
this 
com-
prehensive water infrastructure pack-
age. 
Lastly, I want to state my strong 
support for the Member designated 
projects included in the INVEST in 
America Act. I thank Chairman DEFA-
ZIO for giving my colleagues and I, on 
both sides of the aisle, the opportunity 
to secure dedicated funding for impor-
tant local projects in our districts and 
for instituting strong safeguards in 
this funding to prevent fraud and 
abuse. 
The 
Member 
designated 
projects 
process allowed us to work with our 
State and local transit agencies and 
local governments to highlight high- 
impact transportation projects in need 
of funding. 
I am proud that $20 million for seven 
great projects in my district have been 
included in this bill, including redesign 
of dangerous rail crossings and up-
grades to commuter stations, and per-
haps most significantly, this bill in-
cludes a project I submitted with my 
Pennsylvania colleague (Mr. EVANS), to 
redesign Cobbs Creek Parkway, one of 
the most dangerous corridors in our re-
gion and the site of hundreds of crashes 
and multiple fatalities year after year. 
The redesign will make Cobbs Creek 
Parkway safer for pedestrians, cyclists, 
and motorists. 
Voting against this bill to invest in 
America is voting against jobs; it is 
voting against economic growth; it is 
voting against safety; and it is voting 
against making sure people have clean 
drinking water. Now is the time to 
tackle these issues, and so I urge all 
my colleagues to support this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, also included in this bill 
is the IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act, a bill from the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee to over-
haul and reform the legal powers and 
protections of our inspectors general. 
Inspectors general are a vital part of 
our Federal institutions, ensuring that 
taxpayers and officials have an inde-
pendent source of oversight and infor-
mation to ensure government employ-
ees, from the interns to the President, 
are following the law and properly ad-
ministering their duties. 
For our government to function and 
be free of waste and corruption, to pro-
tect against fraud and impropriety, we 
need inspectors general who are em-
powered to act and who are protected 
from arbitrary, capricious, or personal 
attacks. But we saw, over the past 4 
years, that there were critical flaws in 
the law that govern our inspector gen-
eral programs. We saw that it was pos-
sible for an administration to under-
mine the independence of the inspec-
tors general through unprecedented 
firings and denial of access to informa-
tion. 
A little over a year ago, the former 
President fired five Cabinet inspectors 
general over 6 weeks, with the an-
nouncements often coming on Friday 
nights when the Nation’s attention was 
elsewhere. 
The inspector general for Health and 
Human Services was fired for reporting 
accurately on the Nation’s dire short-
age of lifesaving PPE during the begin-
ning of the pandemic. The State De-
partment inspector general was fired 
for 
investigating 
then-Secretary 
Pompeo’s use of government staff to 
run personal errands. And the Depart-
ment of Transportation inspector gen-
eral was fired for investigating sus-
picious grant awards to Kentucky, the 
State represented by the former Sec-
retary’s husband and the then-Senate 
majority leader. In other words, these 
inspectors general were fired for doing 
their jobs. 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act will enact needed reforms to 
protect IGs from political firings, give 
them increased powers and resources to 
investigate waste and corruption, and 
increase 
accountability 
and 
trans-
parency for the Council of the Inspec-
tors General on Integrity and Effi-
ciency. I strongly support the IG Inde-
pendence and Empowerment Act and 
call on my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, the last bill in today’s 
rule is long overdue. The bill would re-
place the bust of Roger Brooke Taney 
in the Old Supreme Court Chamber in 
the Capitol with a bust of Thurgood 
Marshall and would remove the statues 
of individuals who voluntarily served 
in the Confederate States of America 
from display in the Capitol. 
b 1245 
In Philadelphia, we have a street 
named after Chief Justice Taney and 
we have a Little League World Series 
Champion baseball team named after 
that street. 
In 
2020, 
following 
conversations 
about race and inclusiveness in Amer-
ica, the Taney Dragons Little League 
team decided to rename itself the 
Philadelphia Dragons saying that they 
cannot ignore the very real feelings 
that the name ‘‘Taney’’ engenders 
among members of our community, 
and that the new name will be inclu-
sive, nondivisive, and also speak to our 
league’s geography. 
I say we follow the lead of our chil-
dren on this issue. If they can do it, so 
can we. As we seek to form that more 
perfect Union and secure the blessings 
of liberty for all, we cannot accept the 
presence in this Capitol Building of 
Confederate icons, including the bust 
of the author of the Dred Scott deci-
sion or those who fought to protect 
slavery and wage war against the 
United States. Symbols of the Confed-
eracy deserve to be in textbooks and 
museums, not venerated in the Capitol. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, this rule pro-
vides for the creation of a select com-
mittee to investigate the January 6 at-
tack on the United States Capitol 
Building where we stand. I am, and I 
think most of the public is, dis-
appointed that the Senate failed to join 
in the establishment of a bipartisan 
commission to establish once and for 
all the facts about what happened on 
that day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3253 
June 29, 2021 
We had a bipartisan bill. Chairman 
THOMPSON and Ranking Member KATKO 
of Homeland Security, through good- 
faith negotiations, were able to craft 
bipartisan legislation to create a com-
mission to investigate the January 6 
insurrection. 
Our 
Republican 
col-
leagues got everything they wanted in 
that bill, and yet, their leadership 
withdrew its support at the last mo-
ment and couldn’t take yes for an an-
swer. 
Since our colleagues refused to ap-
prove a bipartisan commission, the 
House must move ahead with an inves-
tigation of the January 6 events and a 
select committee is our final avenue. 
We must investigate the causes and 
events that led to that attack. It is my 
sincere hope that the committee can 
dive into the facts and produce a cohe-
sive narrative around January 6 and 
the events that preceded it and make 
recommendations that will prevent 
such horrors from ever being repeated 
again. 
The January 6 attack on our Capitol 
was a crime, a crime against our gov-
ernment and a crime against the men 
and women who serve here, whether it 
was 
elected 
officials, 
congressional 
staff, or law enforcement. Period. It 
was an ugly, violent crime and crimes 
need to be investigated. Thousands par-
ticipated and over 800 illegally entered 
the building. 
Roughly 500 so far have been crimi-
nally charged by law enforcement. 
Some have pled guilty. But the fact- 
finding is not yet done. We need to 
know how organized they were and 
what their level of coordination was. 
Despite the claims of some in this 
Chamber, we now know that many of 
these rioters were armed, which means 
that every single one of us and all of 
our staffs were in very real danger. 
Some of the rioters came to abduct the 
Vice President and the Speaker of the 
House and put them on trial. Some 
planned to take this building over and 
hold it until January 20 in an attempt 
to stave off President Biden’s inau-
guration. Some just wanted to destroy 
things, and they did. 
That, too, the intention of the riot-
ers, needs to be probed. Some think 
Donald Trump incited this riot; some 
think he did not. New and wild claims 
have surfaced about who instigated the 
violence. Let’s investigate that, too. 
Let’s investigate everything connected 
to this horrible event honestly, un-
flinchingly, objectively, and without 
passion or prejudice, but let us not 
leave this crime unexamined. 
If we are to come together as a Na-
tion to unite behind our shared con-
stitutional values, to ensure domestic 
tranquility and secure the blessings of 
democracy and liberty, we must do so 
from a shared understanding of reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that every mem-
ber of this Chamber can find it in 
themselves to vote for this rule when it 
is considered on the floor. Our country 
cannot afford to wait longer on infra-
structure. If we continue with business 
as usual, our infrastructure deficit will 
continue to grow. Our roads and 
bridges will continue to deteriorate, 
and our national economy will be less 
vibrant and competitive as a result. 
We need to pass the INVEST in 
America Act. Full stop. We also need 
to pass the IG Independence and Em-
powerment Act, and we need to remove 
racist icons from the Capitol. These re-
pairs and reforms cannot wait, and so I 
hope that Congress can find the polit-
ical will to expeditiously pass the bills 
considered under the rule today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides 
for 
consideration 
of 
four 
pieces of legislation: H.R. 2662, the in-
spector general reform bill; H.R. 3005, 
which requires the removal of certain 
Capitol statues; H.R. 3684, the Demo-
crats’ surface transportation reauthor-
ization bill; and then H. Res. 503 which 
establishes a select committee to in-
vestigate January 6. 
The first bill, H.R. 2662, reforms ap-
pointment requirements, authorities, 
and oversight of Federal inspectors 
general. 
Republicans agree that reforms are 
necessary. We agree it is necessary to 
ensure that IGs have the tools they 
need to conduct robust investigation 
and oversight. In fact, there are several 
provisions in this bill that we intro-
duced with Republicans as coleads. 
But 
unfortunately, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
rather than working toward a bipar-
tisan solution, the majority once again 
chooses a partisan approach and re-
jected good-faith efforts from Repub-
licans to craft a proposal that both 
sides agreed on. The bill before us 
today includes problematic language 
limiting a President’s authority to re-
move an IG even when that IG has 
committed dereliction of duty of an 
important act. 
Further, H.R. 2662 requires the Presi-
dent to name the first assistant as act-
ing IG without any exceptions, even 
when that assistant may be implicated 
in the very same misconduct that led 
to the removal of the previous IG. 
Lastly, the bill grants the authority 
to issue subpoenas for former Federal 
officials without providing the nec-
essary protections to prevent abuses of 
this authority. 
Mr. Speaker, without these problem-
atic provisions, the IG reform bill 
could come to the floor with broad, bi-
partisan support. It is just an absolute 
shame though, I must say, it is not sur-
prising that my colleagues across the 
aisle once again threw away an oppor-
tunity for bipartisanship simply to 
score cheap political points with their 
radical liberal base. 
In keeping with that theme, the rule 
makes in order H.R. 3684, the Demo-
crats’ retread of last year’s Green New 
Deal. Only this time it is now disguised 
as infrastructure. Instead of working 
with 
Republicans 
to 
provide 
des-
perately needed infrastructure invest-
ment, House Democrats doubled down 
on the same mandates, the same re-
strictive policies, and the same social 
justice warrior priorities that failed to 
go anywhere last year. 
This partisan package spends nearly 
$548 billion on progressive priorities 
and programs while actually restrict-
ing new road and bridge construction. 
That is right. It actually restricts new 
construction of roads and bridges. 
When we talk about the money, like I 
said, it is about $550 billion. That is an 
11 percent funding increase over last 
year’s bill and a whopping 79 percent 
increase over the bipartisan FAST Act, 
the last surface transportation reau-
thorization bill that was passed by this 
Chamber. 
Alarmingly, but not surprisingly, 
this bill is not paid for. So then where 
does the money come from? Well, the 
answer is simple, deficit spending. Def-
icit spending which further fuels infla-
tion and increases the cost of things 
like gas and food that all American 
families need. Simply put, every Amer-
ican will pay more for everything to 
meet the demands of the Democrat’s 
far-left radical base. 
You would hope that with a price tag 
like this, with an impact on American 
families like this, that the bill would 
actually provide for massive invest-
ment to fix our Nation’s crumbling 
roads and bridges. But you would be 
wrong. H.R. 3684, puts climate and the 
Green New Deal above real infrastruc-
ture needs. In fact, up to $1 out of 
every $2 spent in this bill is tied up in 
Green New Deal mandates. This bill 
puts up roadblocks for transportation 
and also puts up roadblocks for trans-
porting 
clean-burning, 
affordable 
LNG—obviously, 
liquefied 
natural 
gas—which is another blow to blue-col-
lar workers already devastated by Joe 
Biden’s war on American energy and 
his war on blue-collar workers. 
In focusing on this radical far-left 
priority, the majority has failed to in-
clude the regulatory reforms necessary 
to address money-wasting permitting 
delays that currently plague critical 
infrastructure projects. Think about it. 
Right now, it takes 6 years on average 
just to break ground on major public 
projects; 6 years. An average of 20 to 30 
percent of infrastructure project costs 
are lost to red tape. These costs are 
real money. This means that about $164 
billion in this bill would actually just 
be wasted on red tape and project 
delays. 
But that is not even the most egre-
gious example of wasteful spending in 
this legislation. This bill lifts a bipar-
tisan ban and allows the Federal Tran-
sit Administration to spend money on 
art. That is right. According to liberals 
across the aisle, art is now infrastruc-
ture. America’s taxpayer dollars are

hard at work in—clearly, newspeak lib-
eral, or really newspeak on display— 
calling art infrastructure. 
Finally, the bill favors big urban 
areas to the detriment of smaller rural 
communities like the ones I represent 
in southwestern Pennsylvania. H.R. 
3684 prioritizes funding for urban trans-
portation modes like transit and rail 
over roads and bridges that everyday 
Americans use. In fact, more money is 
given to electric vehicle charging sta-
tions than to the entire Rebuild Rural 
grant program. 
I would also be remiss if I failed to 
point out that those very same electric 
vehicles cannot be built without crit-
ical minerals from China. China is, of 
course, the world’s number one pol-
luter. So where are the climate prior-
ities? Where are the environmental pri-
orities that my colleagues on the lib-
eral side of the aisle claim they care 
about? 
At the end of the day, the Democrats 
are prioritizing their fantasy of the 
Green New Deal over traditional con-
cepts of actual infrastructure. My col-
leagues across the aisle, the Liberal 
Party, have chosen to bow down to the 
woke mob that they are terrified of. 
They have chosen to prioritize woke 
liberal yuppies over rural America and 
blue-collar workers that actually work 
for a living. 
Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this rule, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is really 
straightforward. It increases money for 
surface transportation. It focuses on 
hard infrastructure. We need to fix the 
basics and then we can improve and ex-
pand them. This bill does include 
money specifically directed to our 
rural areas, and the crack about urban 
yuppies is kind of crazy. 
We 
know 
that 
in 
Pennsylvania, 
which both the gentleman and I rep-
resent, we know that we have busi-
nesses in western Pennsylvania that 
are losing money because of the state 
of our roadways. If you build a turbine 
in western Pennsylvania, in order to 
get it to the port in eastern Pennsyl-
vania right now, those companies have 
to take an 800-mile detour because our 
roadways cannot support that turbine. 
So it is impacting their businesses. 
It is increasing energy costs. It is 
wasting time. But these kinds of things 
affect businesses across our entire 
Commonwealth and across our entire 
country. So these are much-needed, 
overdue by decades, bipartisan neglect. 
This bill addresses some of those 
issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
my colleagues across the aisle of some 
important facts. 
For one, you can’t make solar panels 
without mining, because you have to 
mine critical minerals. You also can’t 
make windmills without steel, and you 
can’t make steel without mining coal. 
So that is just something to keep in 
mind. 
Mr. Speaker, last month, CBP en-
countered more than 180,000 illegal im-
migrants at our southern border. That 
is a new 21-year high. Think about it. 
Last month, in 1 month, almost 200,000 
illegal immigrants were at our south-
ern border. 
Many of these illegal immigrants are 
traveling from and through high-risk 
South and Central American countries 
where COVID–19 infection rates are 
skyrocketing. South America, in par-
ticular, has become a major COVID–19 
hot spot with death rates eight times 
above the global average. 
And yet, the Biden administration is 
considering ending Title 42, the public 
health authority that allows Customs 
and Border Patrol to quickly turn back 
migrants due to the dangers posed by 
highly contagious diseases. CBP heav-
ily relies on Title 42 authority to expel 
adults and family units that illegally 
cross the border. In May of 2021, CBP 
expelled more than 100,000 individuals 
under Title 42. 
b 1300 
Mr. Speaker, thanks to the draconian 
shutdown measures from far-left Gov-
ernors, including Pennsylvania’s Tom 
Wolf, many States are still recovering 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. Ending 
Title 42 puts that fragile recovery at 
risk, especially at a time when power-
ful variants continue to pop up across 
the globe. 
That is why, if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule to immediately 
consider my good friend’s, Congress-
woman YVETTE HERRELL, PAUSE Act. 
The PAUSE Act would provide for 
stringent enforcement of Title 42, and 
would prohibit HHS and DHS from 
weakening Title 42’s implementation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with any ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, here to explain the amendment is 
the bill’s author, my good friend, Con-
gresswoman HERRELL. I yield 5 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, if the 
previous question is defeated, we will 
amend the rule to immediately con-
sider my bill, H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, 
which will preserve and protect Title 42 
health restrictions at the border. 
The border is in flames, and this cri-
sis is cruel, it is costly, and it is cow-
ardice. 
Biden’s border crisis is harming my 
constituents and all Americans. The 
ranchers and the people who live in and 
around the border cannot let their chil-
dren play outside for fear of cartel gun-
men. In the past, people along the bor-
der, on the American side, in my dis-
trict, have been held at gunpoint. They 
have had vehicles stolen. Some have 
even been kidnapped. 
The first duty of our Nation is to de-
fend its border and its people. Presi-
dent Biden has been derelict in this 
duty, whether it be from the pandemic 
that continues or the violent criminals 
that cross our border in the dark of 
night. 
Sheriffs are reaching out to me. Just 
like the Border Patrol, they, too, are 
overwhelmed. They are seizing record 
amounts of drugs, guns, smuggled peo-
ple, and untold numbers of other illicit 
materials are getting past them, all be-
cause President Biden has put politics 
over the American people. 
President 
Obama’s 
Secretary 
of 
Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, stat-
ed that 1,000 migrants a day was a cri-
sis. Just in May, U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection encountered 180,034 ille-
gal immigrants along the southwest 
border, a 20-year monthly high. That 
amounts to 5,807 illegal immigrants per 
day in May. This is a crisis nearly six 
times greater than the threshold estab-
lished by President Obama’s Secretary 
of Homeland Security. 
Title 42 is the only major Trump-era 
border policy left in place under the 
administration. It allows the Border 
Patrol to quickly expel illegal immi-
grants, sending them back across the 
border, instead of placing them in con-
gregate facilities where outbreaks of 
COVID–19 and other variants are all 
but guaranteed. 
Ending Title 42 would turn what is 
already a crisis into an unmitigated, 
uncontrollable, and undeniable catas-
trophe. 
The pandemic continues to rage in 
Latin America. And Guatemala and 
Brazil are both currently around 90 
percent of their peak weekly infection 
rates. And in the past months, CBP has 
encountered more than 170,000 mi-
grants from those two countries alone. 
Ending Title 42 now, while fewer than 
half of the American citizens are fully 
vaccinated, sends the message that all 
illegal immigration is more important 
than protecting Americans. 
Despite the fact that Biden wants to 
let a flood of illegal immigrants into 
our country, he clearly believes a pub-
lic health emergency still exists. Presi-
dent Biden has placed several COVID– 
19 travel bans on dozens of countries. 
And these bans remain in place, indi-
cating he thinks the public health 
emergency is ongoing. 
Speaker PELOSI has extended proxy 
voting in the House, stating there is an 
ongoing public health emergency due 
to COVID. 
Mr. Speaker, if Vice President HAR-
RIS had taken the time to listen to my 
constituents last week, instead of just 
talking to immigration activists at the 
El Paso airport, this administration 
would learn the effects of their failed

policies on our border communities. 
That is why I invited her twice to visit 
my district. 
If she had cared to respond, she could 
have heard from the farmers, ranchers, 
community leaders, and residents of 
our border communities. She could 
have heard how the crisis is different 
between the gaps in the border wall 
than it is in major cities like El Paso. 
And she could have heard from the five 
county sheriffs in my district who 
wrote to me in support of keeping Title 
42 in place. 
This crisis is a double threat and 
places the security of our Nation and 
the safety of the American people at 
risk. 
At minimum, however, we need to 
keep the last administration’s appro-
priate use of Title 42 in place. That is 
what we could do today, if the previous 
question is defeated. 
We must preserve Title 42 border re-
strictions until all local, State, and 
Federal Government restrictions end; 
until all State and Federal public 
health emergencies end; and Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention— 
CDC—COVID–19 travel risk levels for 
Canada and Mexico have been reduced 
to Level 1. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question. Please don’t 
make the American people pay for the 
mistakes made at our border because of 
the failed policies of this administra-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, does the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania have fur-
ther speakers? 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Yes, I do. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, just another fact of life now. We 
cannot make an electronic vehicle 
without critical minerals. Unfortu-
nately, due to the red tape that is put 
upon the mining industry by liberals 
across the aisle, we are now dependent 
on China for roughly 80 percent of our 
critical minerals. Simply put, we now 
cannot make an electric car without 
China. 
Here to talk about another predica-
ment that liberals across the aisle put 
us in is my good friend from Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Pennsylvania, and I thank 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico for 
articulating so well the state of our 
southern border, which is the direct re-
sult and the consequence of the rote in-
competence of the current administra-
tion and my Democratic colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle. That is the 
best I can put it. 
Or, frankly, it is the purposeful use 
of the border for political purposes. Be-
cause there is nothing else that can ex-
plain what is actually happening at the 
state of our border. That a political 
party would say that having cartels 
having operational control of our bor-
der, to the detriment of the well-being 
of the United States and its citizens; or 
the migrants who seek to come here, 
getting put into the human and sex 
trafficking trade, that somehow that 
should be seen as a compassionate posi-
tion by my colleagues on the other 
side. 
But I will tell you that it is a policy 
that is in the false name of compas-
sion. 
I note that Vice President HARRIS fi-
nally found her way to the border, al-
though it was in a pit stop on her way 
to Los Angeles, taking 4 hours to stop 
in El Paso for a photo-op to go say hi 
to some Border Patrol en route to Los 
Angeles. 
That is not the kind of visit that we 
have been talking about that is re-
quired of the President of the United 
States or his appointee, the Vice Presi-
dent, who is supposedly in charge of se-
curing the border of the United States. 
And I would note that this is real. 
That for those of us who go and spend 
time on the border and talk to ranch-
ers getting overrun; talk to people get-
ting harmed, getting broken into; high- 
speed chases in communities in south 
Texas; the massive amounts of opioids 
flowing into Texas and throughout the 
rest of our country; the number of mi-
grants being abused in the human and 
sex trafficking trade, it is very real. 
To the little girls who I have spoken 
to on the border and visited with, com-
ing across the river at midnight, 1:00, 
2:00 in the morning, and the dangers 
that they have been put into, I would 
ask my Democratic colleagues: Why 
don’t they care? 
Why don’t my Democratic colleagues 
care about these migrants being abused 
and exploited by cartels? 
Today, right now, as we speak, a 
child is on an interstate in Texas, 
heading to be put into child pornog-
raphy and into the sex trafficking 
trade. As we speak in the people’s 
House, it is happening, literally, at this 
moment. 
Some amount of opioids is going into 
I–10, flowing over through Houston, 
throughout the rest of the southeast to 
be distributed throughout our country, 
heading west on I–10 to go out to the 
West Coast. 
Why did Governor DeSantis send re-
sources to Texas? 
Because his State is getting overrun 
by opioid abuse that is coming through 
the southwest border. 
We have a massively wide open bor-
der that is being exploited, and the re-
ality of the situation is it is my Demo-
cratic colleagues who refuse to enforce 
the law. It is that simple. 
Think, from October to December of 
2020, in the previous administration, 
there were 185,000 expulsions made 
under Title 42, which the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico just discussed. That 
was 85 percent of all encounters. Think 
about that: 85 percent of the encoun-
ters we were able to expel under Title 
42. 
Compared to the Biden administra-
tion, since relaxing Title 42—not yet 
eliminating it, although that is alleg-
edly coming—relaxing it, only 64 per-
cent of encounters were enforced be-
tween February to April of 2021, leav-
ing 289,000 expulsions under Title 42. 
So what will happen when that addi-
tional 60 percent of people are taken 
in? 
Border Patrol can’t do their job, 
y’all. They can’t. Border Patrol is over-
run. 
Our border is wide open between the 
ports of entry because the Border Pa-
trol is processing people at processing 
centers in McAllen. The Vice President 
would know that if she hadn’t missed 
the mark by 750 miles, landing her 
plane in El Paso instead of McAllen. 
Tomorrow, 30 to 40 of my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle—to the best of 
my knowledge, zero, unfortunately, on 
the other side of the aisle—are going to 
the border to meet with Governor Ab-
bott and former President Trump to 
talk 
about 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
McAllen, where the actual crisis exists. 
My friend from Pennsylvania rightly 
noted that COVID still remains a 
major public health issue at the border, 
a risk for Americans and migrants. 
Latin America and the Caribbean have 
the world’s highest death toll from 
COVID in proportion to its population, 
with 33 million reported infections and 
1 million reported deaths. 
Brazil leads the region. It leads the 
world in the daily average number of 
new infections reported. Colombia is 
reporting the highest rate of infections 
in South America. Guatemala is at 
peak. Honduras is at 86 percent of 
peak. 
Border Patrol had 9,000 CBP employ-
ees test positive, and 32 CBP employees 
have died. As of March, 7.4 percent of 
tests given to UACs in the past year 
turned out to be positive, and multiple 
facilities have had positivity rates of 10 
percent or higher. That is the reality of 
what is going on at the border. 
Yet Title 42, the health code provi-
sions that allow us to secure the border 
during a pandemic, during the spread 
of communicable diseases, is about to 
be jettisoned by the Biden administra-
tion, endangering the American people 
and endangering our Border Patrol. 
We need to enforce the full Title 42 
authority, and it is imperative for bor-
der and public health security. That is 
why we should defeat the previous 
question. We will amend the rule to im-
mediate consideration of my friend

H3256 
June 29, 2021 
question, which I expect that they will 
do, they are choosing to pursue a rad-
ical leftist environmental agenda that 
will harm Americans, that will harm 
Americans, rather than secure our bor-
der, which we are presenting as an op-
tion, for us to do our job in the people’s 
House, to actually do our duty as the 
people’s House to secure the border of a 
sovereign nation to the benefit of our 
people, of the State of Texas, our en-
tire Nation as a whole, and the mi-
grants who seek to come here. 
That is the choice right now, ladies 
and gentlemen. It is a choice for this 
body. Choose to secure the border of 
the United States and make our coun-
try stronger, or secure a political agen-
da which has no hope of uniting this 
country and benefiting the American 
people. 
The small businesses that the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania was talking 
about, let’s talk about the small busi-
nesses that got crushed under COVID, 
crushed by the policies of this body and 
others, that were shutting businesses 
down to the tune of 100,000 businesses, 
forcing them to close. 
Let’s talk about the impact of our 
kids and schools and the masks being 
worn, and the mental health issues, 
and the cancer screenings that didn’t 
occur because we had locked down and 
shut down our economy. 
And, right now, let’s talk about the 
damage being done to this country be-
cause of wide open borders with em-
powered cartels. 
We should, right now, defeat the pre-
vious question so that we can amend it 
to do the work of the American people. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, does the 
gentleman have additional speakers? 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I am prepared to close. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I think 
I have one more speaker. 
I am finding the argument a little bit 
hard to follow for my colleagues across 
the aisle because, as I understand it, it 
was a bad thing to shut down busi-
nesses in the U.S. to protect people 
when there was a virus rampant here. 
But we have to shut down the border 
because there is a virus rampant here. 
It is just a little hard to follow the 
logic sometimes. 
If the gentleman is prepared to close, 
then I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I am prepared to close, and I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, this Cham-
ber is considering legislation that 
could easily have passed with bipar-
tisan support. If Democrats would stop 
appeasing their radical, progressive 
base and they would stop worrying 
about what whiny, spoiled millennials 
are saying on Twitter, if they decided 
they would finally try to approach 
their work here in some kind of bipar-
tisan manner, then we could work for 
real solutions for real Americans that 
would help the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
for the lively debate today. I under-
stand that there are some who have 
concerns with the rule and its under-
lying legislation, but these bills are vi-
tally important to our country, and I 
am confident they would greatly ben-
efit all of us. 
We should be able to support robust 
infrastructure spending that meets our 
Nation’s current needs. We should all 
support a vigorous corps of inspectors 
general who can weed out fraud, waste, 
and corruption in the Federal Govern-
ment. We should all support removing 
symbols of hate from the Capitol. 
These should be easy bills for us all to 
get behind. 
Lastly, I strongly support the cre-
ation of a select committee to inves-
tigate the January 6 insurrection and 
debunk the absurd theories and false-
hoods that have infected our collective 
understanding of that day. While some 
of our colleagues may continue their 
denial, those of us in this Chamber who 
are committed to transparency and ac-
countability and the well-being of the 
Nation can no longer afford to be held 
back by the sensitivities of those who 
put their fealty to the former Presi-
dent over their duty or obligation to 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for the rule and the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 504 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 9 Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 471. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back balance of my time, and I move 
the previous question on the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 214, nays

GLOBAL LEARNING LOSS ASSESSMENT ACT OF 
2021 
H.R. 1500 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global 
Learning Loss Assessment Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pan-
demic began, 258,000,000 children were out of 
school globally, including 130,000,000 girls. 
(2) Students already at a disadvantage be-
fore COVID–19 will experience greater learn-
ing loss, thereby worsening inequity and in-
equality. 
(3) Approximately 90 percent of the world’s 
student population—over 1,600,000,000 chil-
dren and youth—have had their education 
disrupted by school closure due to COVID–19. 
(4) School closures lead to interrupted 
learning, poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, 
increased dropout rates, exposure to vio-
lence, and social isolation. 
(5) Up to 24,000,000 children are at risk of 
dropping out of school permanently due to 
rising levels of child poverty associated with 
the pandemic. 
(6) School closure and remote learning is 
especially burdensome on girls, who are fre-
quently expected to shoulder more household 
chores and responsibilities and are more vul-
nerable to gender-based violence. 
(7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide 
school closures in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to 
increased instances of sexual- and gender- 
based violence, teenage pregnancy, school 
dropout, and child labor for girls. 
(8) More than 60 percent of national dis-
tance learning alternatives rely exclusively 
on online platforms but two-thirds of the 
world’s school aged children, or 1,300,000,000 
children aged 3 through 17, do not have inter-
net connection in their homes, and schools 
and local learning centers also frequently 
have 
inadequate 
internet 
connectivity. 
Eighty percent of students in sub-Saharan 
Africa lack such access, with an even higher 
rate for girls. 
(9) Children and youth with disabilities are 
particularly vulnerable to the health, edu-
cation, and socioeconomic consequences of 
the pandemic. As a further challenge, dis-
tance learning tools are not always acces-
sible to learners with disabilities or those 
with complex learning needs, especially in 
poorer and rural households. 
(10) Before the COVID–19 pandemic, refugee 
children were twice as likely to be out of 
school as other youth, and school closures 
and a lack of access to distance learning 
tools threaten to make the education gap 
among refugee children even more severe. 
(11) The economic downturn caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic could lead to an edu-
cation financing gap of $77,000,000,000 in low- 
and middle-income countries over the next 2 
years. 
(12) The economic cost of school closures 
could be up to $1,337 per student, which on a 
global 
scale 
equates 
to 
approximately 
$10,000,000,000,000 in lost economic output 
over the coming generation. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States that 
United States-funded basic education pro-
grams operating in low- and middle-income 
countries should seek to— 
(1) provide inclusive learning opportunities 
for students and teachers, especially for the 
most marginalized, including girls, children 
with disabilities, and previously out of 
school children; 
(2) build local capacity and help countries 
strengthen their education systems, includ-
ing opportunities for early childhood devel-
opment; 
(3) improve the availability, delivery, and 
quality of education services from early 
childhood through secondary education; 
(4) improve equity and safety in education 
services; and 
(5) support the return of children to school 
who have experienced interruptions in their 
education due to the COVID–19 pandemic and 
work to enroll previously out-of-school chil-
dren and youth, particularly the most 
marginalized. 
SEC. 4. REPORT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act,

youth, including girls, minority populations, 
displaced children, and those with disabil-
ities. 
(2) An assessment comparing academic 
outcomes of beneficiaries of United States 
Agency for International Development basic 
education programs, as practical and appro-
priate, between those that attend schools 
that remain closed or continue to operate re-
motely since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic and schools that have resumed in-per-
son instruction. 
(3) A description of the effectiveness, cost, 
accessibility, and reach of the most com-
monly used forms of distance learning in 
low- and middle-income countries and low- 
resource contexts. 
(4) A description of efforts to pivot and 
adapt such basic education programs during 
the COVID–19 pandemic, including an over-
view of existing data on funding and pro-
grammatic focus disaggregated by gender,

based-organizations, donors, and multilat-
eral organizations. 
(8) A description of opportunities to part-
ner and support efforts to expand access to 
digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, 
and learning resources in areas that lack ac-
cess to digital and remote learning infra-
structure and resources, including rural and

HAITI DEVELOPMENT, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND 
INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE ACT 
H.R. 2471 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Haiti Devel-
opment, Accountability, and Institutional 
Transparency Initiative Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earth-
quake struck near the Haitian capital city of 
Port-au-Prince, leaving at least 220,000 peo-
ple dead, including 103 United States citi-
zens, 101 United Nations personnel, and near-
ly 18 percent of Haiti’s civil service, as well 
as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, 
and 1,500,000 Haitians displaced. 
(2) The international community, led by 
the United States and the United Nations, 
mounted an unprecedented humanitarian re-
sponse to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 
2018, more than $8,000,000,000 has been dis-
bursed by donors. Since the 2010 earthquake, 
the United States Government has disbursed 
more than $4,000,000,000 in recovery and de-
velopment funding. 
(3) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
struck southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon 
Peninsula, causing widespread damage and 
flooding and leaving 1.4 million people in 
need of immediate assistance. Recovery ef-
forts continue more than four years later. 
(4) Prior to both the 2010 earthquake and 
2016 hurricane, Haiti registered among the

lowest in socioeconomic indicators and had 
the second highest rate of income disparity 
in the world—conditions that have further 
complicated disaster recovery and resilience 
efforts. As of November 2020, 4,400,000 people 
were in need of humanitarian assistance in 
Haiti. 
(5) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians 
have participated in popular demonstrations 
demanding accountability over government 
management of Petrocaribe resources. In 
early 2019, the Haitian superior court of 
auditors released a series of reports impli-
cating high-level government officials in the 
misappropriation of funds. 
(6) The United Nations Human Rights Of-
fice of the High Commissioner and the 
Human Rights Service jointly found a 333 
percent increase in human rights violations 
and abuses against the rights of life and se-
curity in Haiti from July 2018 through De-
cember 2019. There were 131 violations in 2018 
and 567 violations in 2019, including the 
shooting of at least five Haitian journalists 
covering the protests. 
(7) Leading members of civil society have 
faced attacks, including Monferrier Dorval, a 
constitutional law expert and president of 
the Port-au-Prince bar who was killed on 
August 28, 2020. 
(8) On November 13, 2018, according to the 
Haitian National Human Rights Defense Net-
work, at least 71 people were killed and 18 
people were raped in the Port-au-Prince 
neighborhood of La Saline. 
(9) On December 10, 2020, the Department 
of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control designated former Haitian National 
Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former Di-
rector General of the Ministry of the Interior 
Fednel Monchery, and former Departmental 
Delegate Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan pur-
suant to the Global Magnitsky Executive 
Order for being foreign persons responsible 
for or complicit in, or having directly or in-
directly engaged in, serious human rights 
abuse for their connection to the La Saline 
massacre. 
(10) Following the La Saline massacre, 
similar attacks have occurred in Port-au- 
Prince neighborhoods, including the Novem-
ber 2019 and August 2020 attacks on Bel Air, 
in which 24 people were killed and hundreds 
of families were displaced. 
(11) Parliamentary elections scheduled for 
October 2019 did not take place, and since 
January 13, 2020, President Jovenel Moı¨se 
has ruled by decree. The United States and 
international community have urged Presi-
dent Moise to limit the use of executive de-
crees during this period and have expressed 
concern over several decrees issued, includ-
ing those creating the National Intelligence 
Agency and appointing three new judges to 
the Supreme Court outside of constitutional 
procedures. Haitian civil society organiza-
tions have denounced the president’s use of 
decrees as an attempt to consolidate power. 
(12) Due to institutional weakness and 
other challenges exacerbated by the COVID- 
19 pandemic, Haiti’s economy contracted by 
an estimated 4 percent in 2020 and inflation 
neared 20 percent. Although there has been 
no parliament in place since January 2020, 
the Haitian Government approved a budget 
on September 30, 2020. However, the delay 
prevented the International Monetary Fund 
and other multilaterals from disbursing mil-
lions in international assistance. 
(13) In September 2020, President Moı¨se by-
passed the Supreme Court to appoint a Pro-
visional Electoral Council (CEP) by execu-
tive decree Several civil society groups that 
traditionally participate in Haiti’s electoral 
councils criticized the decision and have de-
clined to be represented in the CEP. 
(14) The Moı¨se administration lacks the 
credibility to oversee a proposed constitu-
tional referendum scheduled for June 2021, 
which legal experts consider unconstitu-
tional. 
(15) There are concerns that, given the lack 
of democratic checks and balances, the dis-
pute over the credibility of the electoral 
council, and the deteriorating security situa-
tion, elections scheduled for September 2021 
will not be free or fair. Additionally, the se-
curity situation remains volatile and on Feb-
ruary 7, 2021, President Moı¨se alleged that a 
coup had been attempted against him lead-
ing to 23 arrests and the forced retirement of 
three Supreme Court judges. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to sup-
port the sustainable rebuilding and develop-
ment of Haiti in a manner that— 
(1) recognizes Haitian independence, self- 
reliance, sovereignty, democratic govern-
ance, and efficiency; 
(2) promotes efforts that are led by and

dual citizens of Haiti and the United States, 
with the Haitian Government and the busi-

(5) supports anti-corruption efforts, pro-
motes press freedom, and addresses human 
rights concerns, including through the en-
forcement of sanctions imposed in accord-
ance with the Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act on individuals im-
plicated in human rights violations; 
(6) respects and helps restore Haiti’s nat-
ural resources, as well as strengthens com-
munity-level resilience to environmental 
and weather-related impacts; 
(7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and 
timely elections in accordance with demo-
cratic principles and the Haitian Constitu-
tion; 
(8) provides timely and comprehensive re-
porting on Haiti and the United States Gov-
ernment’s goals and progress, as well as 
transparent post program evaluations and 
contracting data; 
(9) promotes the participation of Haitian 
women and youth in governmental and non-
governmental institutions and in economic 
development and governance assistance pro-
grams funded by the United States; and 
(10) does not provide support to facilitate 
the proposed June 2021 constitutional ref-
erendum, including through multilateral or-
ganizations.

CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF 
TREVOR REED 
H. RES. 186 
Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed 
is a resident of Granbury, Texas, and a 
United States Marine Corps veteran; 
Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow 
to visit his girlfriend in May 2019; 
Whereas Moscow’s Police Service detained 
Trevor Reed in August 2019; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grab-
bing the arm of the police officer driving the 
vehicle and elbowing another officer while en 
route to the police station, causing the vehi-
cle to swerve and therefore endangering the 
lives of the police officers; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed numerous diplomatic notes 
with the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding 
Trevor Reed being denied consular access, 
communications, medical treatment, family 
visitations, and other violations of the Vi-
enna Convention on Consular Relations; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given food or 
water until approximately 72 hours after his 
initial arrest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a med-
ical evaluation of his injuries until 10 days 
following his arrest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team pre-
sented video evidence to the courts that dis-
proves the police officers’ statements of sup-
posed endangerment and wrongdoing; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team was 
denied access to additional video evidence 
from inside the police vehicle and police sta-
tion that had the potential to prove his inno-
cence, the requests for all video recordings 
are documented, and the existence of the 
other videos was confirmed by police offi-
cials and investigators; 
Whereas the police officers claimed emo-
tional and physical damages, but did not sus-
tain any visible injury, or claim any time 
missed from work, and the law considers the 
police officers victims; 
Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation and the Second 
Court of Cassation of General Jurisdiction 
concurred that Russian procedural law was 
violated in the way that Trevor Reed’s bail 
was revoked; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed complaints with the Rus-
sian Foreign Ministry regarding denial of 
communications with Trevor Reed; 
Whereas during the trial, the defense coun-
sel presented 59 minutes of traffic camera 
video from four traffic cameras, and senior 
Russian Government officials analyzed the 
video recordings and confirmed that the vid-
eos showed the police car— 
(1) did not change direction or leave its 
lane; 
(2) did not swerve; and 
(3) did not stop or slow down; 
Whereas witnesses following directly be-
hind the police car in a private vehicle never 
witnessed any dangerous movement of the 
police car; 
Whereas the two police officers changed 
their testimonies in writing, in their inter-
views, and at least three times during de-
fense questioning, with final answers to the 
judge being ‘‘I don’t remember.’’, causing 
court attendees and the judge to laugh; 
Whereas the Investigative Bureau and 
Golovinsky District Court Judge Arnout de-
nied Trevor Reed’s requests to investigate 
how his injuries occurred; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky Dis-
trict Court Judge Arnout read a verdict that 
dismissed all defense evidence, witnesses, 
and government experts and only considered 
pieces of the police officers’ statements; 
Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed 
to 9 years in prison camp and was ordered to 
pay 100,000 rubles to each police officer for 
moral and physical injuries; 
Whereas Trevor Reed had already been de-
tained in Russia for one year at the time of 
the judge’s verdict; 
Whereas a Consul representing the United 
States Embassy in Moscow attended all of 
Trevor Reed’s trial hearings; 
Whereas the United States Ambassador to 
Russia, John Sullivan, upon Trevor’s sen-
tencing, stated that the prosecution’s case 
and the evidence presented against Mr. Reed 
were ‘‘so preposterous that they provoked 
laughter in the courtroom’’, the conviction 
and sentence were ‘‘ridiculous’’, and ‘‘justice 
was not even considered’’; 
Whereas, upon appeal to the Moscow City 
Court, the Golovinsky District Court failed 
to provide Trevor Reed with translated cop-
ies of the court’s decision and trial tran-
scripts per law; and 
Whereas the appeal court returned the case 
to the Golovinsky District Court to review 
omissions and incorrect statements in the 
trial transcripts, and the official court audio 
recordings were reviewed by the defense and 
the corrections were certified by a third- 
party notarization firm, with the result 
being Judge Arnout refusing to include any 
corrections to the corrupted transcripts: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to immediately release Trevor 
Reed and all other prisoners arrested for po-
litical motivations; 
(2) condemns the practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment in the Russian Fed-
eration, which violates the commitments of 
the Russian Federation to international obli-
gations with respect to human rights and the 
rule of law; 
(3) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise the case of 
Trevor Reed and to press for his release; 
(4) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul 
Whelan, and all prisoners unjustly impris-
oned in the Russian Federation; 
(5) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide unrestricted consular 
access to Trevor Reed while he remains in 
detention; 
(6) until Trevor Reed’s release, calls on the 
Government of the Russian Federation— 
(A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary 
medical treatment and personal protective 
equipment; 
(B) to notify the United States Ambas-
sador to Russia of any medical problems or 
complaints that arise during his detention; 
and 
(C) to provide the United States Embassy 
in Moscow with full access to all of Trevor 
Reed’s medical records; 
(7) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to respect Trevor Reed’s univer-
sally recognized human rights; and 
(8) expresses support to the family of 
Trevor Reed and commitment to bringing 
Trevor Reed home. 
URGING
THE
ADMINISTRATION
TO
FACILITATE 
ASSISTANCE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THE
DEV-
ASTATING IMPACT OF COVID–19 IN INDIA 
H. RES. 402 
Whereas in March 2021, a second wave of 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred 
to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) infections began to surge 
in India, overwhelming health care workers, 
hospitals, and crematoriums throughout the 
country; 
Whereas testing results indicate India is 
seeing more than 340,000 new daily infections 
and upward of 4,000 deaths a day, though 
public health experts believe case rates are 
higher; 
Whereas cases have surged in neighboring 
countries such as Nepal and other countries 
in the area remain highly vulnerable to re-
newed spikes in cases; 
Whereas the deadly COVID–19 outbreak in 
India is a global problem that requires a co-
ordinated global response; 
Whereas in the spring of 2020, when the 
United States was in the midst of a dev-
astating spike in COVID–19 cases, India lift-
ed its export ban on certain therapeutics in 
response to a request by the United States 
Government; 
Whereas India’s pharmaceutical industry is 
a vital part of the global solution to the pan-
demic, especially for much of Asia, Africa, 
and Latin America, and is the world’s big-
gest producer of COVID vaccines having ex-
ported 66.36 million doses to 93 countries, in-
cluding to United Nations personnel and, ac-
counting for over half of global vaccine man-
ufacturing; 
Whereas due to India’s critical importance 
in global vaccine supply chains, an increase 
in domestic vaccine demand as a result of 
the surge of COVID–19 cases within India is 
of global concern; 
Whereas in response to the crisis in India, 
the Biden administration took quick action 
to deliver urgently needed supplies to India, 
including oxygen support, oxygen concentra-
tors, personal protective equipment (PPE), 
raw materials for vaccine, rapid diagnostic 
tests, and therapeutics, and is a testament 
to the historic record of United States-India 
health cooperation dating more than seven 
decades; 
Whereas the United States private sector 
has worked to generously support relief ef-
forts in India including by working to deliver 
1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen concentra-
tors to health care facilities across India; 
Whereas many countries around the world 
have also sent medical assistance to India to 
help the country defeat this devastating 
wave of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas as the United States vaccine sup-
ply for the American people is secured, it is 
important for the United States to continue 
to ramp up its efforts, working with the pri-
vate sector and all possible partners, to ex-
pand vaccine manufacturing and distribution 
worldwide; and 
Whereas United States support for India to 
help beat back this latest coronavirus wave 
is in the United States national interest as 
the pandemic will not end anywhere until it 
ends everywhere: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) urges the Administration to facilitate 
private, in-kind medical supply donations to 
India and deliver additional, urgently needed

medical supplies, including oxygen generator 
plants and a cryogenic oxygen tanker and 
containers; 
(2) urges the Administration to facilitate 
assistance as needed to neighboring coun-
tries, including Nepal, that are facing the 
spread of COVID–19 and working with part-
ners around the world to address the virus; 
and 
(3) calls on the United States private sec-
tor and the Indian-American community to 
continue their unprecedented and generous 
efforts at procuring medical supplies for the 
Indian response during this time of need, 
building upon contributions to date, stand-
ing with the people of India as they collec-
tively work to stem the spread of COVID–19. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). Pursuant to House Resolution 
504, the ordering of the yeas and nays 
on postponed motions to suspend the 
rules with respect to such measures is 
vacated to the end that all such mo-
tions are considered as withdrawn. 
The question is on the motion offered 
by the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bills and 
agree to the resolutions. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 366, nays 46,

REPLACEMENT 
OF 
BUST 
OF 
ROGER 
BROOKE 
TANEY 
WITH 
BUST OF THURGOOD MARSHALL 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 504, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 3005) to direct the Joint 
Committee on the Library to replace 
the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the 
Old Supreme Court Chamber of the 
United States Capitol with a bust of 
Thurgood Marshall to be obtained by 
the Joint Committee on the Library 
and to remove certain statues from 
areas of the United States Capitol 
which are accessible to the public, to 
remove all statues of individuals who 
voluntarily 
served 
the 
Confederate 
States of America from display in the 
United States Capitol, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BASS). Pursuant to House Resolution 
504, the bill is considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3005 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF BUST OF ROGER 
BROOKE 
TANEY 
WITH 
BUST 
OF 
THURGOOD MARSHALL. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) While sitting in the United States Cap-
itol, the Supreme Court issued the infamous 
Dred Scott v. Sandford decision on March 6, 
1857. Written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke 
Taney, whose bust sits inside the entrance to 
the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the 
United States Capitol, this opinion declared 
that African Americans were not citizens of 
the United States and could not sue in Fed-
eral courts. This decision further declared 
that Congress did not have the authority to 
prohibit slavery in the territories. 
(2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney’s au-
thorship of Dred Scott v. Sandford, the effects 
of which would only be overturned years 
later by the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 
15th Amendments to the Constitution of the 
United States, renders a bust of his likeness 
unsuitable for the honor of display to the 
many visitors to the United States Capitol. 
(3) As Frederick Douglass said of this deci-
sion in May 1857, ‘‘This infamous decision of 
the Slaveholding wing of the Supreme Court 
maintains that slaves are within the con-
templation of the Constitution of the United 
States, property; that slaves are property in 
the same sense that horses, sheep, and swine 
are property; that the old doctrine that slav-
ery is a creature of local law is false; that 
the right of the slaveholder to his slave does 
not depend upon the local law, but is secured 
wherever the Constitution of the United 
States extends; that Congress has no right to 
prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery may 
go in safety anywhere under the star-span-
gled banner; that colored persons of African 
descent have no rights that white men are 
bound to respect; that colored men of Afri-
can descent are not and cannot be citizens of 
the United States.’’. 
(4) While the removal of Chief Justice 
Roger Brooke Taney’s bust from the United 
States Capitol does not relieve the Congress 
of the historical wrongs it committed to pro-
tect the institution of slavery, it expresses

torious wrongs to have ever taken place in 
one of its rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger

sion.

vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on House Administration or 
their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LOFGREN) and the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rial. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill. It directs the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library to replace the 
bust of Chief Justice Roger Taney in 
the Old Supreme Court Chamber with a 
bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall. It 
also directs the removal of statues and 
busts of individuals who served the 
Confederacy, and other white suprema-
cists. 
The United States Capitol is a beacon 
of democracy, freedom, and equality, 
visited by millions of people each year 
before COVID hit, and soon we hope to 
be visited by millions of people again. 
What and who we choose to honor in 
this building must represent our val-
ues. 
Chief Justice Taney, who, in the Dred 
Scott decision, declared that African 
Americans could never be citizens of 
the United States and had no constitu-
tional rights, does not meet this stand-
ard; and neither do the white suprema-
cists and Confederates we continue to 
honor with statues today. 
Justice Taney’s decision continued 
and permitted the expansion of slavery. 
Those who founded, served, and fought 
for the Confederacy were willing to 
spill American blood in defense of it. 
In his infamous Cornerstone Speech, 
Confederate Vice President Alexander 
Stephens said that slavery and white 
supremacy were the cornerstone of the 
Confederacy. 
There is no shortage of American fig-
ures like Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
the first African American to serve on 
the Supreme Court, more deserving of 
the honor of being displayed in our 
Capitol. 
There are some who argue that this 
action is an attempt to erase and for-
get our history. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. We must never 
forget our Nation’s shameful periods of 
slavery, segregation, and racism. 
This is, instead, about who we choose 
to honor, who we choose to literally 
put on the pedestal and display as em-
blematic of our values. 
We are just months removed from 
January 6, when a mob of insurrection-
ists looking to violently overturn a 
Presidential election stormed this very 
building. During that awful attack, the 
same Confederate flag carried into bat-
tle against the United States in the 
19th century was again carried into 
battle against the United States and 
into this very Capitol. 
It is long past time to remove from a 
place of honor in our Nation’s Capitol 
the statues and busts of those who fa-
vored war against the United States in 
support of the so-called government 
founded on a cornerstone of racism and 
white supremacy. 
Outside 
the 
Old 
Supreme 
Court 
Chamber, before you get to the Taney 
bust, you pass another sculpture, which 
depicts the figures of History and Jus-
tice. Today, we can demonstrate to the 
Nation and the world that we have 
learned from our history and we con-
tinue to pursue justice. 
Put another way, we can follow the 
advice of the great American poet and 
civil rights activist Maya Angelou. 
This is what she said: ‘‘Do the best you 
can until you know better. Then when 
you know better, do better.’’ 
Let us now show ourselves and the 
world that we are who we claim to be. 
Let us do better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
3005, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3265 
June 29, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, the chair of the House Adminis-
tration Committee, for the opportunity 
to be here today. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 3005, but 
not because of the goals that it at-
tempts to achieve. Many of us have 
been fighting for those same things. In 
fact, some of the comments that she 
made, you will find in my remarks 
about some of the people whose statues 
are here that I do not believe should be 
in this honored building, and I have 
fought for a long time to remove those. 
But I am in opposition to the process of 
which we are trying to impose to do 
this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Repub-
licans and Democrats agree that rac-
ism, in any shape or form, is repugnant 
and must be denounced. I do intend to 
vote for this bill, as I did last summer, 
when Congress considered a similar 
measure. 
It is interesting, however, that our 
colleagues across the aisle have only 
recently deemed the cause of removing 
statues worthy of immediate action. 
When you look at the facts, it is even 
more puzzling. 
Since 1870, statues have been present 
in the United States Capitol, and 
Democrats retained a majority in the 
House 40 times since then. They have 
had ample opportunities to remove 
these statues that Members of their 
own party are responsible for placing 
in the Capitol in the first place, but 
have done nothing. 
Again, the timing here is rather pe-
culiar. After retaining the majority 40 
times, one would think that if this 
were truly a pressing issue, they would 
have acted sooner. 
For many years, I have advocated 
that 
North 
Carolina’s 
statues 
of 
Charles Aycock and Zebulon Vance be 
removed based on their ties to the Con-
federacy. I have suggested that two 
statues of people that all North Caro-
linians and all Americans can be proud 
of be put in their place. 
I am proud that the first Republican 
majority in North Carolina’s Legisla-
ture in 140 years voted in 2015 to re-
place the Aycock statue with a statue 
of Reverend Billy Graham. Yet this re-
quest has been awaiting action by the 
Democrat-chaired Joint Committee on 
the Library for months. If they were 
truly concerned about removing these 
statues, they might be quicker to act 
on the requests to replace some of the 
very same statues. 
I will look past the times the North 
Carolina Democrat Party used Gov-
ernor Aycock’s name in fundraising 
materials and the meetings they held 
in buildings that sported his name. 
Maybe today’s vote is to compensate 
for the decades of inaction under a 
Democrat-controlled House of Rep-
resentatives. We will let the American 
people decide. 
Republicans are always open for a 
spirited debate on this issue, and I am 
confident that we can find common 
ground. 
While I plan to support this legisla-
tion and recognize its underlying in-
tent, this is an issue that is way past 
its due date. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, be-
fore yielding to the gentleman from 
North Carolina, I would like to correct 
the record. The Joint Committee on 
the Library organized last Wednesday. 
Until last Wednesday, the Joint Com-
mittee was chaired by Senator ROY 
BLUNT of Missouri, a Republican Sen-
ator, and I have now been chair for 6 
days and hope to act promptly on the 
North Carolina matter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD), the distinguished 
chair of the Election Subcommittee in 
the House Administration Committee. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, let me first thank the chair for her 
leadership and friendship on our com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, just a little bit of 
history. I want to take you back to 
1860. President Lincoln won the general 
election in 1860 by winning 18 of 29 
States. 
Madam Speaker, the 11 States that 
Lincoln failed to carry were slave-hold-
ing States. These States were fearful 
that Lincoln would find a way to end 
slavery and deprive slave owners of 
their 
free 
labor. 
Eleven 
Southern 
States immediately seceded from the 
Union, forming the Confederate States 
of America. The CSA elected its leader-
ship, they printed a currency, and they 
set up a military. 
At Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, the 
CSA took military action against the 
United States of America. For the fol-
lowing 4 years, more than 600,000 Amer-
icans lost their lives on the battlefield, 
including Black Union soldiers. This 
was not a war between the States; it 
was a war against the United States by 
11 
Southern 
States, 
including 
my 
State. 
When the Union finally won the war 
and both sides buried their dead, 4 mil-
lion slaves were granted their freedom 
by the passage and ratification of the 
13th Amendment. 
In 1864, each State was granted the 
privilege to donate two statues of de-
ceased persons to be displayed in this 
Capitol that depict the history of their 
State. These statues are now known as 
the National Statuary Hall Collection. 
Approximately 10 of these statues de-
pict men who volunteered to fight 
against the United States in the Civil 
War. All of these statues were donated 
many decades after the Civil War. Like 
many other statues around the country 
honoring members of the Confederate 
States of America, particularly those 
erected in the South, these 10 statues 
were not donated and installed in the 
Capitol until the 1900s, during the 
height of the Jim Crow era. 
Many Americans see these statues 
and the timing of their placement to 
intimidate Black Americans and to 
perpetuate the notion of white suprem-
acy. We must not continue to honor 
these combatants by allowing their im-
ages to be displayed in this Capitol. 
The bill before us today, Madam 
Speaker, identifies several other stat-
ues for removal that are not part of the 
collection, including the bust of Chief 
Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who au-
thored the 1857 Supreme Court decision 
of Dred Scott that ruled that slaves 
could not be considered citizens and 
that Congress did not have the ability 
to ban slavery. This opinion, Madam 
Speaker, is regarded as possibly the 
Supreme Court’s worst decision of all 
time, and the 7–2 decision was a major 
factor contributing to the Civil War. 
Another bust not a part of the Na-
tional Statuary Hall Collection is for 
Vice President John Breckinridge, 1856 
to 1859. In 1860, Breckinridge ran for 
President on the Southern Democratic 
ticket and he lost. During the Civil 
War, Breckinridge served in the United 
States Senate, from Kentucky, but be-
came a traitor and enlisted in the Con-
federate military and assigned to the 
Army of Mississippi, achieving the 
rank of Major General. And it gets 
worse. He was expelled from the United 
States Senate. Jefferson Davis then ap-
pointed him as Secretary of War. After 
the war, he fled the country for several 
years. 
Madam Speaker, this statue must 
also be removed. 
I ask my colleagues to answer the 
summons of our time by voting to re-
move these statues from the Capitol of 
the United States of America. 
b 1515 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as I stated earlier, 
you will find that many, if not all, on 
this side of the aisle will agree with 
most of the comments, if not all the 
comments, that are made by our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
I think we need to go back and look 
at where we have been as a nation and 
where we are going. A lot of what we 
put into this building should reflect 
not only our history but our values as 
a nation. 
That is why I, in the past, have advo-
cated very strongly for certain statues 
to be removed. I think it is important 
now that we have both parties looking 
at this. 
As my colleague from North Carolina 
mentioned, Taney and the Dred Scott 
decision, I think it was during a time 
period when Democratic President An-
drew Jackson nominated his bust to be 
put in the Capitol here today. 
Now, it can’t be overstated how much 
this body and this country condemn 
the institution of slavery. I believe, as 
a whole, this Nation has done that and 
continues to do that. 
In fact, when I was in the Georgia 
legislature, I realized that Georgia was 
the sole State of the former Confed-
eracy that had not officially con-
demned the act of slavery nor had con-
demned its participation in slavery

June 29, 2021 
during these dark periods of our Na-
tion. So, I introduced legislation called 
the Freedom Resolution, which would 
formally acknowledge the ills, the ha-
tred, and this dark period of our Nation 
that our government, our State gov-
ernment, the State that I love, was ac-
tually engaged in. 
That was a very painful time in our 
history, but we learned from that his-
tory. I don’t think anyone wants to for-
get that time period, else we will re-
peat that in some shape, form, or fash-
ion. 
As I said, it is important that the 
statues that we have here reflect the 
values of this Nation. In fact, I was 
very vocal many times in the past over 
one of Georgia’s two statues here, 
Alexander Stephens. To say he was a 
racist was an understatement. As was 
mentioned, his ‘‘Cornerstone Address,’’ 
as we read it today, is just wrought 
with the idea that all men are not cre-
ated equal. 
In fact, he was very condemning of 
Thomas Jefferson and George Wash-
ington. He even went as far as illus-
trating that they were insane because 
of our founding documents being built 
upon a false premise, and that false 
premise was the idea that God created 
all of us equal. He went on to say that 
God didn’t create us equal. He went on 
to say that White people were superior 
and that that is why we have the insti-
tution of slavery, and it should be pre-
served. 
Those are not ideas that are com-
mensurate with what we believe in this 
Nation. But it was during a time period 
where many of the Old South, Demo-
crat-led houses and senates and statue 
commissions, were trying to hold on to 
those old ideas and principles that our 
party—the party of emancipation was 
brought up, Abraham Lincoln. We have 
been opposed to these ideas. We totally 
wrapped our arms around this idea that 
all men are created equal, that we are 
all given equal opportunity, that all 
life is important, that everyone is cre-
ated in the eyes of God, and that this 
government exists to protect those 
freedoms and those liberties. 
But there were those in the Demo-
crat-controlled Southern States who 
wanted to hold on to the old ideas, 
those ideas that Alexander Stephens 
espoused. That is why, in Georgia, the 
Democrat-led commission wanted to 
poke their finger in the eyes of the 
Federal Government, and they nomi-
nated or placed as statues these people 
who held ideas different than what we 
hold as a party over here, what we hold 
as a nation today. 
My opposition to this bill isn’t be-
cause of the goal that we are trying to 
achieve, but it is the way that the ma-
jority continues to skirt procedure in 
this body for the second consecutive 
Congress. This bill was rushed to the 
floor without a hearing or a markup in 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion. 
I am sure we will hear from my col-
leagues on the other side that Repub-
licans are insincere in our opposition 
to slavery and dragging our feet when 
it comes to removing these statues. In 
fact, it was a Republican, a good friend 
of mine in the State legislature, Scot 
Turner, who in 2020 introduced legisla-
tion that he knew I supported, and I 
came out publicly supporting, to re-
move Stephens’ statue and replace it 
with a statue of Martin Luther King, 
Jr. 
The States have begun to take ac-
tion. As we talked about, North Caro-
lina has already taken action to re-
move their statues and replace them. 
But I am very concerned about this 
committee. 
In fact, the Joint Committee on the 
Library, the committee responsible for 
facilitating the removal of statues ap-
proved by State legislatures, was only 
organized last week. Now, this is 6 
months from the start of the 117th Con-
gress. I have been on the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, and I was very 
excited the first year I was appointed 
to the Joint Committee on the Library 
because, as a fan of the Library of Con-
gress, I thought this would be a great 
opportunity to participate in pre-
serving the history and heritage of this 
Nation. 
But of the three terms that I have 
been on the committee, from my recol-
lection, the committee has only met 
three times, and that was an organiza-
tional meeting each time. It is hard to 
do your work when you don’t even get 
together to do the work. 
The lack of urgency to organize the 
committee is reason for enough con-
cern. Even more disappointing is our 
failure to address several approved 
statue 
replacement 
requests 
from 
State legislatures. 
In October 2015, the State of North 
Carolina began the process of switching 
out the statue of Charles Brantley 
Aycock with the Reverend Billy Gra-
ham. Now, this passed the North Caro-
lina House 71–28, a bipartisan vote, and 
in the Senate, 44–0, a unanimous vote 
in the North Carolina Senate. Yet, we 
still have not taken action on approv-
ing that for a man who definitely had 
a very strong impact not only on civil 
rights but on our Nation as a whole, 
who we so respect that his body laid in 
the rotunda not too long ago. Yet, we 
still have not been able to move on get-
ting that done, as well as several other 
States. 
I believe that we need to focus our ef-
forts on changing this process because 
I think it would mean a whole lot 
more, a whole lot more to this body as 
well as to the American people if the 
States who originally put those statues 
in here were the ones that now asked 
that they would be removed. I think 
that would be much more appropriate 
than this body taking action. If we re-
formed our process to make it where 
the States could actually do it, it 
would mean a whole lot more to the fu-
ture of our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, before yielding, I 
just want to note, for purposes of clari-
fying the historical record, that the 
Republicans of the 19th century and 
the early 20th century bear almost no 
resemblance to the Republican Party 
of today. Similarly, the Democratic 
Party bears no resemblance to the 
Democratic Party of the 19th and early 
20th centuries. They are the same par-
ties in name only. 
In the 19th century, the Republicans 
were generally the party of the north-
erners, and the Democrats were the 
party of the South, and that has 
switched. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Madam Chair for her leadership 
on this very important issue. 
The point that she makes is inter-
esting because, actually, in terms of 
the 14th Amendment, when 
Black 
Americans were given the right to 
vote, it was the Republicans who were 
the votes to make that happen, and the 
Democrats, to a person, voted against 
it. So, her point is well taken. Now, we 
are in a fight to protect that right to 
vote, but we will have that conversa-
tion another day. Today, we are here 
for a very specific purpose. 
Madam Speaker, this weekend, we 
observe the birth of our Nation, the 
Fourth of July, when Americans joy-
fully celebrate the birth of America’s 
independence and the blessings of lib-
erty. 
As we do so, we solemnly recognize 
that those blessings have been denied 
to so many throughout our Nation’s 
history out of sheer bigotry and rac-
ism. 
This holiday, while a celebration, is 
also an opportunity to take steps to 
right the wrongs of history, starting 
here, right here in the U.S. Capitol. 
That is why, today, we are again 
passing legislation to remove statues 
of Confederate officials and other advo-
cates of bigotry and removing them 
from the U.S. Capitol. 
As I have said before, the Halls of 
Congress are the very heart of our de-
mocracy. The statues that we display 
should embody our highest ideals as 
Americans, expressing who we are and 
who we aspire to be as a nation. 
Monuments to men or people who ad-
vocated 
cruelty 
and 
barbarism 
to 
achieve such a plainly racist end are a 
grotesque affront to those ideals. They 
are an homage to hate, not heritage. 
They must be removed. 
I thank Leader STENY HOYER, who 
has been advocating this for a long 
time and took charge and worked with 
Whip 
JIM
CLYBURN, 
Congressional 
Black Caucus Chair JOYCE
BEATTY, 
Chair 
BENNIE
THOMPSON, 
Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE, Congressman G. 
K. BUTTERFIELD, who we just heard 
from, and the Chair. Madam Speaker, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3267 
June 29, 2021 
thank you and the others for your lead-
ership. 
This action builds on actions taken 
last Juneteenth when, using my au-
thority as House Speaker, I ordered the 
removal of four portraits of past 
Speakers from the Capitol who traitor-
ously served in the Confederacy. 
Among the Confederate statues in 
the Capitol that we are addressing 
today are Jefferson Davis and Alex-
ander Stephens, president and vice 
president of the Confederacy, respec-
tively, both of whom were charged with 
treason against America. 
This legislation also removes from 
the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the 
Capitol the bust of Justice Roger 
Taney, a defender of slavery and the 
author of the 1857 Dred Scott ruling, 
one of the most horrific stains on our 
Nation and the Court’s history. Mr. 
HOYER has been particularly interested 
in removing Justice Taney. 
Removing these statues will not 
erase this stain or that of other racist 
acts in our history, nor will it erase 
the racism that exists in our country 
today. But it is an important and nec-
essary step. 
How can we seek to end the scourge 
of racism—including by passing the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, 
which the Chair has championed—when 
we allow the worst perpetrators of that 
racism to be lauded in the Halls of Con-
gress? 
Congress has the opportunity and the 
obligation to make meaningful change. 
Let us lead by example. 
The Taney bust will be replaced by a 
tribute to U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Thurgood Marshall, an icon of equality 
and champion of justice in America. 
I am very proud of Justice Marshall’s 
Baltimore roots, as a native Balti-
morean, and I am happy that our Balti-
more airport is named for him. 
Justice Thurgood Marshall’s words, 
uttered nearly 30 years ago, must be 
our inspiration. He said: ‘‘America 
must get to work. . . . We must dissent 
from the indifference. We must dissent 
from the apathy. We must dissent from 
the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust.’’ 
He went on further to say: ‘‘We must 
dissent because America can do better, 
because America has no choice but to 
do better.’’ 
His words were later echoed by our 
Baltimore brother Elijah Cummings, 
who said: ‘‘We are better than this.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we can do better, 
for the children. I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote on this important step to do 
better, to right the wrongs of history, 
and to move our Nation toward a fu-
ture of justice. I do so with gratitude 
for all of the champions who have 
brought us to this important day. I 
urge a strong bipartisan vote. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), my good 
friend and the leader of the Repub-
licans here in the House. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
you have been a dear friend for a long 
time. You have been in my office, and 
you sat on the couch. I sat across, in 
the chair. And you know the portrait 
that hangs in my office, a portrait of 
Abraham Lincoln. I am proud that he 
was the first Republican President of 
the United States. I am proud of the 
action that he took in a defining time 
of our Nation. The greatest challenge 
ever to our Constitution was the Civil 
War, by long and by far. 
b 1530 
The bill we are voting on today we 
voted on before. I supported it then, 
and I support it now. 
But let me state a simple fact: All 
the statues being removed by this bill 
are 
statues 
of 
Democrats. 
Madam 
Speaker, as I heard the Speaker talk 
earlier about removing the four por-
traits of Speakers in the hall, the same 
answer goes for that, as well. They 
were all Democrats. 
What is interesting is the statues 
that need to be removed were sent to 
the Capitol by States that were a ma-
jority controlled by Democrats sent to 
a House that had a majority controlled 
by Democrats accepting of these stat-
ues. 
I think the bill should go further. 
Maybe it is time the Democrats change 
the name of their party. They may be 
desperate to pretend their party has 
progressed from the days of supporting 
slavery, pushing Jim Crow laws or sup-
porting the KKK. 
But let’s be honest, at any place at 
any time if those fundamentals rest 
somewhere, we cannot let them. 
Let’s go through some of the words 
and actions of a few Democrats. Just a 
few years ago then-Vice President Joe 
Biden praised Democrat Senator Rob-
ert Byrd. He was an ‘‘exalted cyclops’’ 
of the Ku Klux Klan. In his eulogy for 
Byrd he said: ‘‘For a lot of us, he was 
a friend . . . mentor . . . and guide.’’ 
Another 
leading 
Democrat 
who 
praised Byrd at the time was Speaker 
PELOSI. She called Byrd a friend, a 
great person, and a great American pa-
triot. 
Madam Speaker, today the Demo-
cratic Party has doubled down on what 
I consider this shameful history by re-
placing the racism of the past with the 
racism of the critical race theory. 
They continue to look at race as the 
primary means of judging a person’s 
character. We saw this just last week. 
Senate Democrats voted to confirm one 
of President Biden’s appointees who 
said: ‘‘We must do everything in our 
collective power to realize Dr. Kendi’s 
vision for America.’’ 
Let me be clear about what that vi-
sion is. Kendi, the author of ‘‘How to 
Be an Antiracist’’ proposed in his book 
that the solution to past discrimina-
tion is present discrimination. Now 
that is what the person who is now in 
charge of the personnel of the entire 
Federal Government is endorsing. And 
this divisive vision isn’t confirmed or 
just confined to one person or depart-
ment. 
The Navy included Kendi’s book on 
its official reading list for sailors and 
the 
Department 
of 
Education 
has 
praised 
the 
debunked 
‘‘The 
1619 
Project,’’ citing it as an example of 
what should be taught to our children. 
Critical race theory is the governing 
ideology of what we are now finding in 
the Biden administration. By advo-
cating for it Democrats continue to 
fuel hatred and division across the 
country. 
I agree with Senator TIM
SCOTT: 
America is not a racist country. 
America must reject critical race 
theory for the simple reason: State- 
sponsored racism is wrong and always 
will be. 
It was wrong when it was segregated 
lunch counters of Jim Crow, and it was 
wrong when it was segregated class-
rooms of critical race theory. 
Madam Speaker, many times I won-
der what would America have looked 
like had Abraham Lincoln not been as-
sassinated? Malice towards none. What 
would America have looked like had 
the agreement to remove the Federal 
troops from the south because Joseph 
Rainey was elected to Congress, and 
Jim Crow laws were passed by Demo-
crat-controlled offices in the south? 
Our Nation was built on a unifying 
vision from the beginning. As Lincoln 
said, we are conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that we 
are all equal. 
I will vote for this bill today, just as 
I voted for it before, but, Madam 
Speaker, if we have not learned any-
thing, we should not divide our Nation 
based on race. 
I applaud the Democrats for standing 
up, removing Democrat statues from 
Democrat-controlled majorities sent to 
a Democrat majority House that ac-
cepted them. It is about time. But, 
Madam Speaker, to continue along in a 
critical race theory where you would 
teach an individual that they are right 
or wrong based upon the color of skin 
goes against everything that we are 
voting about today. 
Madam Speaker, you know my heart, 
and I know yours. There are times we 
might disagree on philosophy or how 
best to run a government, but we never 
disagreed by judging somebody by the 
color of their skin. 
And I hope we take this moment and 
this opportunity as we promised before 
to strive to be a more perfect Union. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the ma-
jority whip. We are so lucky to have as 
our whip someone who started his pub-
lic service as a fighter for civil rights. 
Like our colleague, the late John 
Lewis, our whip put his life on the line 
for civil rights and for voting rights. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
the time. 
I listened pretty intently to the mi-
nority leader talking about theory, a 
principle upon which a set of practices

are made. That is what a theory is. We 
are not here today to talk about the-
ory. 
Today, we are talking about some ac-
tions, some practices that were made. 
We are talking about moving to make 
this Nation more perfect. And one of 
the ways you do that is by recognizing 
and admitting that we have a very 
spotted history when it comes to race. 
I met my late wife in jail protesting 
practices that were based upon our 
skin color. Racial inequities, that is 
what this is all about. 
One of the statues in this building 
sent up here by my State, South Caro-
lina, is a statue of John C. Calhoun. 
John C. Calhoun is not here because he 
defended the southern States during 
the Civil War. We talk about those gen-
erals all over this place. 
John C. Calhoun died in 1850, more 
than a decade before the Civil War 
started. So why is he here? Why did 
South Carolina send his statue up here 
for us to honor? Simply because he was 
this Nation’s foremost proponent of 
slavery. So much so until Yale Univer-
sity from which he graduated took his 
name off the college that they cele-
brated him with. Clemson University, 
which he was one of the founders of, 
took his name off of his Honors Col-
lege. 
Charleston, 
South 
Carolina, 
where he is buried took his statue 
down overnight. People went to bed 
around 11 o’clock at night looking at 
the statue, and when they got up at 6 
o’clock the next morning, it was gone 
because South Carolina has done every-
thing they can to get beyond those 
principles advocated by John C. Cal-
houn. 
But his statue is here. And I want to 
thank the Speaker for moving that 
statue to some place out the eyesight 
of any school child coming up here. I 
always call this Hall ‘‘America’s class-
room.’’ And we ought to be teaching in 
this Hall that which is wholesome 
about the country. 
This is a great country. Nobody de-
nies that. I don’t call this a racist 
country. I do say that this country has 
on occasion, too often for my taste, 
tolerated racism. That is a fact. And 
nobody can deny that fact. 
Last time this bill came before this 
body, over 70 of my Republican friends 
voted for it. I would hope we could do 
a little better today. 
Madam Speaker, I close by reminding 
my friend, most of us who studied his-
tory, we know when the Republican 
Party came into being. We know when 
the Democratic Party came into being; 
it happens to be an older party than 
the Republican Party. So I understand 
all of that. But we also know that in 
1948, when Hubert Humphrey spoke at 
the 
1948 
Democratic 
Convention 
against segregation, Strom Thurmond, 
the Democrat, left the party, came 
back. And in 1964 when Democrats 
came together and decided that they 
were going to pass the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964, Strom Thurmond, the Demo-
crat, left the Democratic Party, be-
came a Republican, and took all of 
those segregationists with him into the 
South Carolina Republican Party. The 
South Carolina Republican Party built 
itself on the Confederate battle flag. 
Those are facts of history. We can’t 
deny those facts, and we won’t try to. 
We try to do whatever we can to do 
what George Santayana admonished us 
to do; learn the history and gather les-
sons from that history or we run the 
risk of repeating that history. What we 
should do today is relegate these stat-
ues to the dust bin of history. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the very passionate words 
that we have heard here today. And as 
I said in the beginning, we on this side 
of the aisle not only agree, but we have 
been advocating for these very things 
for quite some time. 
In fact, as far as Georgia’s statue, I 
have advocated in times past for the 
removal of Alexander Stephens’ stat-
ue—it has been on several occasions 
that I have spoken about this—and let 
me just share with you this one idea, 
this principle, the criticism that he 
made of our Founders, because he be-
lieved that our founding documents, 
the Declaration of Independence and 
the 
Constitution 
were 
inherently 
flawed. This is what Stephens said. 
‘‘The prevailing ideas entertained by 
him,’’ meaning Jefferson, ‘‘and most of 
the leading statesmen at the time of 
the formation of the old Constitu-
tion’’—talking about the Constitution 
we have today because he was advo-
cating for the Confederate Constitu-
tion—‘‘were that the enslavement of 
the African was in violation of the laws 
of nature; that it was wrong in prin-
ciple, socially, morally, and politi-
cally.’’ And we agree with that. 
What he is saying is the flaw of our 
Founders was that they believed this 
idea that all men are created equal, 
and they put that in our founding docu-
ments. 
The reason I bring that up today is 
because of something that the minor-
ity leader said, which is that under 
critical race theory they are teaching 
that our founding documents were the 
opposite, and more that they were 
what Alexander Stephens was saying 
they were, that they are flawed, that 
they teach racism. But Alexander Ste-
phens was taking the opposite ap-
proach, and he says they weren’t teach-
ing racism, that is why they are 
flawed. 
This is why I have advocated a long 
time for the removal of Stephens’ stat-
ue. In fact, as I was speaking about 
this at one time, my family and I re-
ceived a threat from the Ku Klux Klan 
in Georgia, because I adamantly be-
lieve that we are all created equal and 
we are all given the same opportunities 
in this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
b 1545 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
in her opening remarks, the gentle-
woman quoted Maya Angelou earlier. 
And since Maya Angelou spent her 
childhood in my district in Arkansas, I 
wholeheartedly agree with the words of 
Maya Angelou that we can do better. 
But I am not convinced that H.R. 3005 
is actually doing better. Madam Speak-
er, this bill would remove all statues 
from the U.S. Capitol of individuals 
who voluntarily served in the Confed-
erate Army or, it appears, who are now 
otherwise deemed by Democrats as rac-
ist and unfit for any type of honor. 
One of the statues named for removal 
is James Paul Clarke, a Democrat from 
Arkansas, who served as a U.S. Senator 
and the 18th Governor of Arkansas. His 
statue was placed in the Capitol by 
Democrat majorities in both the Ar-
kansas House and Senate. 
The Speaker might be interested to 
learn that the Republican Arkansas 
State legislature voted in 2019 to re-
place James Paul Clarke and its other 
statue, 
which 
depicts 
Uriah 
Rose. 
Speaker PELOSI
is already familiar 
Uriah Rose. You see, last year, on June 
10, Speaker PELOSI sent a letter to the 
Joint Committee on the Library re-
questing it remove 11 statues which de-
pict Confederate soldiers and officials, 
which she says involves Uriah Rose. 
Uriah Rose was an Arkansas attor-
ney, who was a founder and two-time 
president of the American Bar Associa-
tion. Uriah Rose also founded the Rose 
Law Firm in Little Rock, at which Hil-
lary Clinton began her legal career and 
became the firm’s first female partner. 
The Speaker will be pleased to know 
that neither Uriah Rose nor James 
Paul Clarke were commissioned into 
the Confederate Army. Uriah Rose 
never fought for the Confederacy, and 
James Paul Clarke was 7 years old 
when the Civil War began. 
However, following the established 
procedures for placing statues in the 
Capitol, Arkansas has recognized racist 
beliefs held at least by the Democrat 
Governor and Senator James Clarke 
and, in 2019, began the process of re-
placing our two statues with those who 
have made significant, meaningful con-
tributions to Arkansas and our Nation: 
Country music legend Johnny Cash and 
civil rights activist Daisy Bates. 
Madam Speaker, every State can fol-
low that process. Many have and many 
are. Daisy Bates was a civil rights ac-
tivist who was an unstoppable force 
during the desegregation of Arkansas, 
and I am proud that Arkansas chose 
her as one of the statues to replace 
James Paul Clarke and Uriah Rose. 
Daisy Bates was instrumental in se-
curing safe entry into Little Rock Cen-
tral High School for the ‘‘Little Rock 
Nine’’ in September of 1957, one of the 
first high schools in Arkansas to inte-
grate following the Brown v. Board of 
Education Supreme Court decision in 
1954. 
Arkansas has been working with the 
Architect of the Capitol and the Joint 
Committee on the Library to replace 
these statues for 21⁄2 years, complying 
with every step in the process.

June 29, 2021 
H.R. 3005 also names other statues, 
such as Charles Brantley Aycock, a 
Democrat from North Carolina who did 
not serve in the Confederate Army, but 
has racist ties, who North Carolina has 
been trying to replace with Reverend 
Billy Graham since 2015. 
This bill naming statues that are in 
the process of being replaced is nothing 
more than what I believe is an attempt 
by Democrats to prematurely thwart 
the authority of States in order to 
claim the moral high ground for them-
selves. If Democrats were serious about 
cleansing the U.S. Capitol of statues 
depicting those with racist views, 
Speaker PELOSI would insist the Joint 
Committee on the Library make it a 
top priority to work with Arkansas and 
North Carolina to expedite the replace-
ment of these statues that are already 
in process. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I am glad to hear the gentlewoman is 
going to work to see the Billy Graham 
statue is quickly added, and I ask that 
she does the same for Arkansas statues 
of Johnny Cash and Daisy Bates. 
Madam Speaker, we don’t need a do- 
nothing messaging bill from Demo-
crats. We don’t need another nanny- 
state mandate from House Democrats 
telling States what they need to do. 
What we need is a get-something-done 
attitude and real leadership, and these 
statues will be gone out of the Capitol. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, just 
a note of the process. In fact, Arkansas 
is now selecting an artist to develop 
the Bates statue that has to be ap-
proved before we can proceed. Mean-
while, even though they want to get rid 
of that statue, it stays here. If we pass 
this bill, the statue will be gone while 
Arkansas pursues a replacement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN), my colleague, a member of 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion, and a scholar and former con-
stitutional law professor. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her great 
leadership on this. 
Madam Speaker, it is one thing to re-
member the Nation’s Confederate trai-
tors. It is another thing to glorify 
them. It is time to stop glorifying 
white supremacy in black robes and 
Confederate traitors who defected from 
the Union and took up arms against 
the United States. 
Now, I represent Frederick County, 
Maryland, where Justice Taney lived. 
The city of Frederick, 5 years ago, took 
down their statue of the man who 
wrote the Dred Scott opinion, which 
found that an African American could 
never be a citizen within the meaning 
of Article III of the Constitution, and 
in which he wrote: ‘‘Blacks have no 
rights which the White man is bound to 
respect.’’ 
In the name of original intent, Jus-
tice Taney transformed our Constitu-
tion into a White man’s compact. He 
disgraced the Supreme Court. It would 
take the Civil War, the Reconstruction 
amendments, 
and 
the 
civil 
rights 
movement to dismantle the white su-
premacist constitution. 
Now we are going to replace him with 
a great Marylander, who has stood the 
test of time, Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall, who was one of the architects of 
the legal strategy to dismantle Jim 
Crow and to replace Plessy v. Fer-
guson. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, Jus-
tice Marshall argued the White pri-
mary line of cases: Smith v. Allwright 
and Terry v. Adams. He argued Brown 
v. Board of Education. He became the 
first African-American Supreme Court 
Justice. 
As for all the other Federal office-
holders who took an oath to support 
our Constitution but then defected to 
the Confederacy and waged insurrec-
tion and rebellion against the United 
States, they were banned by Section 3 
of the 14th Amendment from ever serv-
ing in public office again, at the Fed-
eral level, at the State level, or at the 
local level. 
Why should they occupy a position of 
honor and reverence in this building? 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 111⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 121⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
prior to the organizing of the current 
Joint 
Committee 
on 
the 
Library, 
Ranking Member RODNEY DAVIS and I 
sent a letter to the Joint Committee 
on the Library to demand immediate 
action on North Carolina’s pending re-
quest to replace the statue of Charles 
Brantley Aycock with the statue of 
Reverend Billy Graham. 
So far, the request has been ignored, 
but I can only assume it was because it 
would impede the ability to do what we 
are doing here today. But I am encour-
aged by the chair’s commitment to act 
on that very quickly. 
I would also say that this isn’t an 
isolated case. There are currently eight 
States with pending requests, including 
Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, Kansas, 
North Carolina, Nebraska, Utah, and 
Virginia. 
In fact, Georgia has just introduced 
in this last session a new piece of legis-
lation to remove Stephens’ statue with 
that of the late Representative JOHN 
LEWIS, which is receiving bipartisan 
support. In fact, the Republican Speak-
er of the House is the top cosponsor of 
that legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
will have to admit that when I first got 
this job and walked through Statuary 
Hall, I was kind of surprised at some of 
the people who are honored there. In 
particular, Alexander Stephens was one 
that kind of jumped out at me. 
And right before the end of the Civil 
War, Abraham Lincoln talked about 
malice towards none and charity for 
all. And I think that charity for all was 
being a little abused when people like 
Alexander Hamilton Stephens got their 
statue down there. 
Be that as it may, there is another 
part of this bill that is put before us. 
We have talked about the Dred Scott 
decision. I am going to talk a little bit 
about Roe v. Wade and a history of Roe 
v. Wade that I think a lot of people 
don’t know about. I get this history in 
part from an article put out by 
Planned Parenthood and in part from a 
book written by Bob Woodward. 
Obviously, Roe v. Wade could be de-
scribed as the most significant court 
decision in that it legalized abortion, 
and we have 60 million fewer Ameri-
cans than we would have if this deci-
sion had not happened. 
However, a change was made in that 
decision as they were debating it, up-
ping that 60 million figure a little bit 
higher because a decision was made at 
the end to go from allowing abortions 
at 3 months to allowing abortions all 
the 
way 
until 
viability—late-term 
abortion. 
The author of that decision, Justice 
Blackmun, was just going to go 3 
months, and he got a letter put out by 
Thurgood Marshall, who wanted it to 
be much higher. 
I can’t tell you exactly how many 
abortions past 3 months we have had in 
this country, but it is probably over 5 
million. 
And 
that 
was 
because 
Thurgood Marshall was in the right or 
wrong position—however you want to 
look at it—to go from 3 months to 
making America one of seven countries 
in the world where they allow abor-
tions so late. And of those countries in-
cludes North Korea, Vietnam, Red 
China—not countries you want to be 
associated with. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, if 
this bill becomes law and we walk 
through there, we are going to see 
Thurgood Marshall—or at least I will 
always look at him as the guy who 
weighed in and felt after abortion was 
largely illegal in this country for its 
first 200 years, the guy who kind of put 
the foot on the gas and legalized late- 
term abortion and put the United 
States in with those other six coun-
tries. 
Madam Speaker, for that reason, I 
am going to vote against this bill 
today. And, hopefully, someday in 
America, the Roe v. Wade decision and 
putting the United States in the posi-
tion in which even 6- or 7-month-old

babies can have their lives taken away, 
hopefully that will eventually end. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the chairwoman for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, the great Thurgood 
Marshall won 29 of 32 cases before the 
Supreme Court of the United States of 
America. He was eminently qualified 
then and he is now, and this is a proper 
thing for us to do. 
I want to close with this: If Judge 
Taney and his cohorts had their way, 
there would be no person of color in 
this building today. 
Madam Speaker, if they had their 
way, you would not be at that podium. 
Madam Speaker, I stand with Mr. 
HOYER. I am grateful for what he has 
done, and I will vote for this legisla-
tion. Its time has long since come, and 
we are doing the right thing. Dr. King 
reminded us, ‘‘the time is always right 
to do that which is right.’’ 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
it is refreshing to know that there is so 
much we actually do agree on in this 
Chamber, because the things that my 
good friend from Texas just said, we 
agree on, and we have agreed on since 
Abraham Lincoln was the President. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS), my good friend, who is also 
the ranking member of the Committee 
on House Administration. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
and my friend on the Committee on 
House Administration for running this 
debate for our side. 
Madam Speaker, despite its flaws, I 
intend to vote for the underlying bill. 
But, nevertheless, I rise to highlight 
several points the majority has failed 
to address. 
It has been 6 years—6 years—since 
the people of North Carolina, through 
their elected State legislature, re-
quested on a bipartisan basis to replace 
the State statue of Charles Brantley 
Aycock, a former Democrat Governor 
of that State, who supported segrega-
tion and white supremacy. 
The people of North Carolina have re-
quested to replace the statue with a 
sculpture of the late Reverend Billy 
Graham, a worthy North Carolinian re-
spected and beloved by millions. 
Even the Speaker of the House has 
had many kind words for Reverend 
Graham, only the fourth American 
ever to lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol. 
b 1600 
In a press release dated February 21, 
2018, the Speaker said in part the fol-
lowing: ‘‘Reverend Graham’s leadership 
and firm partnership with the Rev-
erend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
were vital in the fight for civil rights 
in the South. His counsel to U.S. Presi-
dents, regardless of party, brought 
grace and humility into our politics.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the entire press release. 
PELOSI STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF THE 
REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM 
(February 21, 2018, Press Release) 
SAN FRANCISCO—Democratic Leader Nancy 
Pelosi issued this statement today on the 
passing of the Reverend Billy Graham: 
‘‘Today, millions around the world grieve 
the loss of the Reverend Billy Graham. His 
clarion message of fellowship and faith lifted 
and inspired countless members of the Chris-
tian community. 
‘‘Reverend Graham’s leadership and firm 
partnership with the Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. were vital in the fight for 
civil rights in the South. His counsel to U.S. 
Presidents, regardless of party, brought 
grace and humility into our politics. In mo-
ments of crisis, from terrorist attacks to 
horrific natural disasters, Americans roiled 
by tragedy and turmoil looked to Reverend 
Graham for solace. 
‘‘May it bring comfort to William, Nelson, 
Virginia, Anne, Ruth and the entire Graham 
family that so many around the world share 
in their sorrow at this time.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with the 
Speaker’s remarks. Reverend Graham 
was vital in the fight for civil rights in 
the South. 
So, today, I ask: Why are we still 
having this conversation 6 years later? 
Why do the Democrats continue to 
delay States’ efforts, like North Caro-
lina and Arkansas, to replace the stat-
ues in question that are currently at 
the Capitol? Why do Democrats delay 
action, keeping these statues of known 
racist Democrats in this building? 
Democrats have done nothing on any 
statue for the past 6 months, leaving 
statues of segregationists, known rac-
ists, and other Confederate Democrats 
in our Capitol. 
As an aside, we know this process 
shouldn’t take this long. Kansas, which 
has no statues in question in the under-
lying bill, has been waiting 22 years to 
put a statue of Amelia Earhart in the 
Capitol. 
Just yesterday, the chair of the Joint 
Committee on the Library, a Demo-
crat, signed the paperwork in about 30 
seconds when pressed on it, despite 
waiting over 6 months to organize the 
Joint Committee on the Library this 
Congress. 
It is clear that the Democrats could 
move these requests along at any time 
but instead are actively continuing to 
delay the process. 
In an effort to speed up this process, 
I offered an amendment yesterday at 
the Rules Committee that very reason-
ably would have addressed these delays 
and would have required the Joint 
Committee on the Library to act with-
in 30 days of receiving any actionable 
items on statue replacement. Thirty 
days, come on. 
Democrats ruled it out of order. I be-
lieve that is because they wanted to 
vote on this bill. Each of the statues in 
question represents a known racist who 
was a Democrat from the past. The ma-
jority party is anxious to erase their 
discriminatory history from the Cap-
itol with this action. 
So, let’s have the vote. Let’s have a 
vote on this Democrat bill intending to 
remove Democrat statues. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
constituent 
Abraham Lincoln is buried in my dis-
trict, the 13th District of Illinois, the 
first Republican President of our great 
Nation. I am proud to represent that 
history. I stood on this floor debating 
and supporting this bill in the last Con-
gress, and I will support it again. 
But please, Madam Speaker, please, 
please encourage the Democratic ma-
jority to help us reform this broken 
process that has delayed and delayed 
and kept statues of known Confed-
erates, known racists, who happen to 
be Democrats in the past, in this Cap-
itol. 
Let’s work together. Let’s get this 
done. Let’s stop playing games. 
And let’s actually open the Capitol 
again. It is kind of interesting and 
ironic that no one can see these statues 
because the Capitol is closed. 
What are we doing to establish a plan 
to reopen our Capitol for our Nation to 
actually share in this history, to share 
in the history of Abraham Lincoln, to 
share in the history of our country, to 
share in the special building that we 
get the chance to walk in and work in 
while it remains closed? 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working in a bipartisan way to reform 
this broken process. Madam Speaker, I 
am thankful for the opportunity to 
speak today, and I intend to vote for 
this bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask how much time remains on both 
sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). The gentlewoman has 111⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Georgia has 3 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BASS). 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3005 to remove 
the bust of Chief Justice Roger Taney 
and Confederate statues from public 
display in the U.S. Capitol Building. 
The people’s House can never truly 
be for the people if it is lined with trib-
utes to those who fought to continue 
the enslavement of Black people in this 
country. 
My ancestors built this building. 
Imagine how they would feel knowing 
that, more than 100 years after slavery 
was abolished in this country, we still 
paid homage to the very people who be-
trayed this country in order to keep 
my ancestors enslaved. 
Imagine how I and other African 
Americans and people of color feel 
walking through Statuary Hall, know-
ing that there are monuments to peo-
ple who supported, embraced, and 
fought for the breakup of our country. 
We are not trying to erase our his-
tory. We must confront our past when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3271 
June 29, 2021 
we talk about who we should honor in 
this building. 
Should we honor the man who wrote 
the Supreme Court ruling that African 
Americans can’t be citizens? Or should 
we honor the man who got the Su-
preme Court to rule that separate but 
equal cannot be equal? Should we 
honor a legal architect of slavery? Or 
should we honor a legal architect of 
the civil rights movement? 
When I hear my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle talk about the 
Democratic Party, I wonder if you are 
aware of the whole history of the civil 
rights movement, where Black people 
and other people of color fought to 
enter the Democratic Party. And when 
people objected to our participation, 
and when people objected to our right 
to vote, those people left the Demo-
cratic Party and joined the Republican 
Party. We are extremely aware of our 
history of racism in the Democratic 
Party. 
Part of our history as Americans is 
that we criticize our country. We don’t 
just honor the nice stories of our his-
tory, but we honor and embrace all of 
our history. And we fight for a more 
perfect Union. Fighting for a more per-
fect Union for people of color meant 
fighting 
to 
enter 
the 
Democratic 
Party. 
It is my hope that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle will go back 
to that history of the Republican Party 
that you honor and fight for the right 
of all Americans to vote. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
and I am glad to be back. 
Madam Speaker, I have been out for 
2 weeks, and now that I have a new 
knee, I am good for another 20 years. 
That is what they tell me. They guar-
antee me that. 
Madam Speaker, when I brought this 
bill to the floor just about a year ago, 
I referred to our Capitol Building as a 
sacred space for democracy, a symbol 
around the world of democracy. The in-
tervening months have shown us, in 
ways we could not have imagined then, 
just how true that statement was and 
is. 
Sadly, we in this House, our col-
leagues in the Senate, all who work 
here, experienced on January 6 a 
wrenching reminder of how democracy 
demands our eternal defense and vigi-
lance. We watched our temple of de-
mocracy defiled by a violent mob of in-
surrectionists. For many of us here, 
that was a watershed moment, seeing 
such evils pervade the halls of the 
American Capitol. 
However, Madam Speaker, for Afri-
can Americans, who have been serving 
here, working here, and visiting here 
for many decades, that sense of defile-
ment of this sacred space is all too fa-
miliar for them. 
Our colleague, the former speaker of 
the California Assembly, KAREN BASS, 
made that clear when she spoke. When 
they see individuals like John Calhoun, 
Charles 
Aycock, 
and 
James 
Paul 
Clarke celebrated in stone and bronze 
in these halls, they are reminded that, 
for so much of our history, the leaders 
and leading institutions of our govern-
ment and country did not view them as 
equal or, at times, even human. 
When they enter the solemn Old Su-
preme Court Chamber and stare into 
the cold marble eyes of Roger Brooke 
Taney, they are reminded that, at one 
time, the highest court in our land de-
clared that Black lives did not matter. 
Mr. Speaker, we ought not be sur-
prised when our fellow citizens of color 
raise signs that say: No, America, 
Black lives do matter. That is some-
what what this debate is about. 
In the infamous 1857 Dred Scott deci-
sion written by Justice Taney, a distin-
guished citizen of Maryland revered in 
his time for his intellect and his ac-
complishments, Taney, in this terrible 
decision, quoted the Declaration of 
Independence, which all of us quote so 
often: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are created 
equal.’’ Today, we would say all men 
and women are equal, irrespective of 
color. 
But this Dred Scott decision ought to 
teach us a lesson today. It ought to 
humble us today. When people around 
us say, ‘‘Boy, that is the right deci-
sion,’’ because it happens to be the de-
cision of the moment, not a decision of 
history. 
Beneath those lines, Taney wrote 
these: ‘‘The general words,’’ that is, 
that all men are created equal, ‘‘The 
general words above quoted would seem 
to embrace the whole human family.’’ 
Hear me, colleagues. This is Taney 
speaking in a decision where he is 
about to say Black lives do not matter. 
He said, however, that it ‘‘would 
seem to embrace the whole human 
family,’’ not divided by color or gender 
or nationality or religion, the whole 
human race. And he went on to say: 
‘‘And if they were used in a similar in-
strument at this day would be so un-
derstood.’’ I want you to think about 
that. 
I want you to think about it, col-
leagues, with humility. Frankly, I 
want 
those 
who 
argue 
for 
the 
originalist point of view to think of 
that. Taney thought of that. And he 
thought, in his day, in 1857, the whole 
human family would be covered by ‘‘all 
men are created equal.’’ 
But notwithstanding that belief, he 
did not so rule because he was mired in 
the past, and the progress of those 
some 90 years had alluded him because 
he went on to say: But ‘‘the enslaved 
African race were not intended to be 
included and formed no part of the peo-
ple who framed and adopted this Dec-
laration.’’ An originalist. 
The Founders were human. They 
were extraordinary humans, but they 
were human. Their environment shaped 
their thoughts, as they do ours. 
Taney’s words were used by the Con-
federacy during the Civil War to justify 
the creation of a regime built to sus-
tain the enslavement of African Ameri-
cans in perpetuity, with no possibility 
of recognizing their humanity. 
b 1615 
Even though Taney said that in 1857, 
that would have been the popular defi-
nition of all men are created equal, 
Blacks and Whites alike. 
And those words have been used ever 
since by bigots and white supremacists 
to justify segregation, racial violence, 
and discrimination. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my fellow col-
leagues that we must not allow the au-
thor of those words to hold a place of 
honor in our Capitol. That is why I in-
troduced this legislation along with 
Representative BARBARA LEE; my dear 
friend of over a half a century, JIM 
CLYBURN; Representative KAREN BASS, 
former Speaker of the California As-
sembly; Chairman BENNIE
THOMPSON 
from Mississippi; and Representative 
G. K. BUTTERFIELD a North Carolina 
former Supreme Court Justice; and the 
present chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, Congresswoman JOYCE 
BEATTY from Ohio. 
Because this building, this sacred 
space, this temple of democracy has 
been defiled for too long. We owe it not 
to forget history. We must learn from 
history. But we ought not to honor 
that which defiled the principles for 
which we think we stand and for which 
I think we do stand. 
It is time, Mr. Speaker, to remove 
those symbols of slavery, segregation, 
and sedition from these Halls. How re-
cently we saw, remembered the savage 
genocide in Tulsa just a few weeks ago, 
justified in the minds of many, I am 
sure, that these, after all, were not 
men who were created equal. They 
were not children created in the image 
of God. And therefore, some rational-
ized the taking of their lives because, 
after all, their lives did not matter, 
and therefore, no one was prosecuted, 
no one was held accountable. 
As I said, Roger Brooke Taney was 
from my State of Maryland, and I ac-
knowledge, as I was growing up as a 
kid in the late 1950s in high school and 
then in college in the 1960s, my party 
was the segregationist party. And my 
party decided that we did not want to 
be that party and that there was not a 
home for segregationists in the Demo-
cratic Party. That is a decision we 
made consciously, knowing full well 
the cost and that is why Lyndon John-
son said when he signed one of the civil 
rights bills: We may have just given up 
the South. 
In our State capital of Annapolis, Mr. 
Speaker, we removed the statue of 
Chief Justice Taney, the highest rank-
ing Marylander in the Federal Govern-
ment in history. It had stood there 
when I was sworn in as a member of 
the State Senate. And when I listened 
to Governor Agnew give his State of 
the Union, it was on the site of the

Roger Brooke Taney statue on the east 
front of our Capitol. 
If you turn and walk west through 
the Capitol of Maryland, you will come 
out on a park. It is the Thurgood Mar-
shall Park, a testament to the progress 
and enlightenment that occurred from 
Taney to Marshall in our State. 
The decision to remove Taney’s stat-
ue was long overdue, but as the gen-
tleman from Texas said Martin Luther 
King said: It is never too late to do the 
right thing. And this, today, is the 
right thing. It reflects our growth as a 
State as we have confronted the most 
difficult parts of our history and it will 
reflect our growth as we recognize it 
here, as we did overwhelmingly when 
we passed this last year. Over a third of 
my Republican colleagues joined the 
Democratic colleagues in saying Black 
lives do, in fact, matter. 
Those who say we shouldn’t teach 
about slavery or that we should sweep 
it under the rug or that we should skip 
over the lines in our Constitution that 
reference it, do a disservice to our un-
derstanding of America’s greatness. 
JIM CLYBURN, our whip, a civil rights 
hero in his own right, likes to quote de 
Tocqueville 
saying 
that 
America’s 
greatness is not that it always does the 
right thing. America’s greatness is 
that it is willing to correct its wrongs. 
We are great because we approach our 
past with humility and openness. And 
we are great because we continue to 
protect our democracy through more 
inclusion, more tolerance, more jus-
tice, more equality, that all men and 
women, irrespective of artificial dis-
tinctions or real distinctions, are equal 
in the eyes of our Constitution and of 
our laws. 
That is why Democrats and Repub-
licans 
came 
together 
earlier 
this 
month to make Juneteenth a national 
holiday, overwhelmingly, a handful 
voting against that, in an articulation 
of our principles today, not yesterday. 
That was Roger Brooke Taney’s great 
blindness. That is why I believe we can 
take this important step together 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House once 
again to join me in passing this legisla-
tion, to remove these statues and bust 
of Chief Justice Taney from the Cap-
itol. Not to forget them. Not to say 
they weren’t part of history, but they 
are not deserving of our honor. Not be-
cause we want to erase history but be-
cause we are determined to confront it. 
As a Marylander, proud of steps we 
have taken in Annapolis, I believe that 
Justice Thurgood Marshall would be a 
far better ambassador for the greatness 
of American democracy and for our 
State of Maryland than Roger Brooke 
Taney. Where Roger Brooke Taney rep-
resents the worst of American justice 
and racism, Thurgood Marshall rep-
resents the best of justice and equality. 
He deserves to be honored in this Cap-
itol for his trailblazing career and life-
long dedication to civil rights and 
equal justice for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues, not as Republicans and Demo-
crats, but as Americans who believe we 
are a special, exceptional country be-
cause we lift up the individual and we 
protect the 1 against the 99 if the 1 is 
right. That is the essence of America. 
And even though they did not live it 
out perfectly, they articulated the per-
fection of all men are created equal. 
And endowed not by the Constitution, 
not by the laws of Congress, not by the 
majority vote of their fellow citizens, 
endowed by their creator with certain 
unalienable rights. 
That is what this vote is about today, 
and I urge my colleagues, vote ‘‘yes’’ 
for America, vote ‘‘yes’’ for its prin-
ciples that are so respected properly 
around the world.

the gentlewoman from California, I am 
prepared to close if she is. I reserve the 
balance of my time.

markup, so you may proceed. I reserve

Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the members of the North 
Carolina delegation that was written 
to the Joint Committee on the Library 
encouraging them to move quickly on 
their request to replace the Aycock 
statue with that of Billy Graham. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES 
Washington, DC, June 29, 2021. 
Hon. ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson, 
Joint Committee of Congress on the Library. 
Hon. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
Ranking Member, 
Joint Committee of Congress on the Library. 
CHAIRPERSON LOFGREN AND RANKING MEM-
BER KLOBUCHAR: We write today to encour-
age the Joint Committee of Congress on the 
Library’s (JCL) expeditious approval of the 
North Carolina General Assembly’s request 
to replace the State’s current statues in the 
National Statuary Hall Collection. Since 
2015, North Carolina has worked to replace 
one of its current statues, which depicts 
Charles Brantley Aycock, an individual asso-
ciated with white supremacy, with one of the 
late Reverend William Franklin ‘‘Billy’’ Gra-
ham, Jr. Despite North Carolina’s diligent 
efforts in coordination with the Architect of 
the Capitol (AOC) and past Joint Commit-
tees on the Library, the statue of Aycock re-
mains. 
On October 2, 2015, the North Carolina Gen-
eral Assembly passed Session Law 2015–269; 
HB 540, ‘‘An Act Requesting the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library of Congress to Ap-
prove the Replacement of the Statue of 
Charles Brantley Aycock in National Stat-
uary Hall with the Statue of the Reverend 
William Franklin ‘‘Billy’’ Graham, Jr.’’ This 
legislation passed the North Carolina House 
with bipartisan support and passed the North 
Carolina Senate unanimously. 
In February 2018, North Carolina Governor 
Roy Cooper and Lieutenant Governor Dan 
Forest sent letters to the AOC in support of 
the General Assembly’s request. 
On July 29, 2020, the North Carolina Legis-
lature’s Statuary Hall Selection Committee 
unanimously approved the design of the Rev. 
Graham statue. 
According to the AOC, North Carolina’s re-
quest continues to await JCL approval to 
proceed to step five of the ten-step replace-
ment process. Now, over six months into the 
117th Congress, JCL’s delayed organization 
continues to hinder North Carolina’s wishes 
to remove a white supremacist’s statue from 
the Capitol. 
We implore the JCL to honor the will of 
the people of North Carolina by moving im-
mediately to complete its work on North 
Carolina’s request and to stand ready to as-
sist as needed in order to ensure the State’s 
wishes are finally realized without further 
delay. 
Sincerely,

Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the official 10- 
step Architect of the Capitol statue re-
moval and replacement process. 
This process was established in the 
2000 omnibus and further defined in 
2014 and requires coordination between 
the State, the Architect of the Capitol, 
and the Joint Committee on the Li-
brary. All requests for statue replace-
ments begin in State legislatures and 
is then communicated to the Architect 
of the Capitol who then manages the 
communication of the request to the 
JCL for approval through the process. 
ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL 
January 2014. 
PROCEDURE
AND GUIDELINES
FOR REPLACE-
MENT OF STATUES IN THE NATIONAL STAT-
UARY HALL COLLECTION 
The creation of the National Statuary Hall 
Collection was authorized by the United 
States Congress in 1864 to allow each State 
to provide two statues of notable citizens for 
display in the United States Capitol. The 
Joint Committee on the Library of Congress 
has oversight of the collection, and, under 
the committee’s direction, the Architect of 
the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the re-
ception, placement, and care of the statues. 
In accordance with legislation enacted in 
2000, ‘‘Any State may request the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library of Congress to approve 
the replacement of a statue the State has 
provided for display in Statuary Hall’’ under 
two conditions: 
(A) the request has been approved by a res-
olution adopted by the legislature of the 
State and the request has been approved by 
the Governor of the State, and 
(B) the statue to be replaced has been dis-
played in the Capitol of the United States for 
at least 10 years as of the time the request is 
made, except that the Joint Committee may 
waive this requirement for cause at the re-
quest of a State. 
Steps in the Procedure 
1. Responsibilities of the State. The State 
legislature enacts a resolution that identi-
fies the statue to be replaced, names the in-
dividual to be newly commemorated and 
cites his or her qualifications, selects a com-
mittee or commission to represent the State 
in selecting the sculptor, and directs the 
method of obtaining the necessary funds to 
carry the resolution into effect. Expendi-
tures for which the State is responsible in-
clude the cost of paying the sculptor for de-
signing and carving or casting the statue; de-
signing and fabricating the pedestal; trans-
porting the statue and pedestal to the United 
States Capitol; removing and transporting 
the replaced statue; temporarily erecting the 
new statue on its pedestal in the location ap-
proved for the unveiling ceremony; certain

expenses related to the unveiling ceremony; 
and any other expenses that the State com-
mission may find it necessary to incur. 
2. Request to Replace a Statue. A duly au-
thorized State official, typically the gov-
ernor, shall submit to the Architect of the 
Capitol a written request to provide a new 
statue, a description of the location in the 
State where the replaced statue will be dis-
played after it is transferred, and a copy of 
the applicable enacted State legislation au-
thorizing the replacement. The Architect of 
the Capitol will review the request for com-
pleteness and will forward it to the Joint 
Committee on the Library. 
3. Joint Committee on the Library Action. 
The Joint Committee on the Library will ap-
prove or deny the request. 
4. Agreement Regarding Replacement. If 
the request is approved by the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, the Architect of the 
Capitol will formalize an agreement with the 
State to guide the process. The agreement 
consists of the State’s commitment to follow 
the guidelines for the design and fabrication 
of statues (see below) and to take responsi-
bility for any cost related to the design, con-
struction, transportation, and placement of 
the new statue; the removal and transpor-
tation of the statue being replaced; and any 
unveiling ceremony. The agreement is be-
tween the Architect of the Capitol and the 
State. If the State authorizes a commission, 
foundation, or other entity to act upon its 
behalf in subsequent parts of the process, the 
governor must so notify the Architect of the 
Capitol in writing. 
5. Approval of Maquette. The State or its 
representative shall submit to the Architect 
of the Capitol, for review and final approval 
by the Joint Committee on the Library, pho-
tographs of the maquette from all four sides 
and the proposed dimensions of the com-
pleted statue. 
6. Approval of Full-Size Clay Model and 
Pedestal Design, Including Proposed Inscrip-
tion. The State shall submit to the Architect 
of the Capitol, for review and final approval 
by the Joint Committee on the Library, pho-
tographs of the model from all four sides, di-
mensions, engineering drawings of the ped-
estal, the anticipated weight of the com-
pleted statue and pedestal, and the text of 
any proposed inscriptions. Any structural, 
safety, and design concerns will need to be 
addressed before final approval. 
7. Approval of Completed Statue, Cast in 
Bronze or Carved in Marble, and Completed 
Pedestal. The State shall submit to the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol, for review and final 
approval by the Joint Committee on the Li-
brary, photographs of the completed statue 
and pedestal from all four sides, dimensions, 
the final weight, and the text of any inscrip-
tions. 
8. Ceremony and Program. The holding of 
an unveiling ceremony is optional. Permis-
sion to use the Rotunda or Emancipation 
Hall must be granted by concurrent resolu-
tion of the Congress, and legislation by the 
Congress is required to authorize printing of 
the proceedings at government expense. The 
State may contact its delegation in Congress 
for assistance and for introduction of the re-
quired legislation. 
Although no law requires the Congress to 
accept statues by formal resolution, it is rec-
ommended that acceptance of the statue by 
the Congress be included in the legislation 
introduced for the use the Rotunda or Eman-
cipation Hall for the unveiling ceremony. 
The State must arrange the program for 
the ceremony with the Speaker of the House, 
who will ensure that congressional participa-
tion is bipartisan and bicameral and that the 
program concludes in a reasonable time. The 
Architect of the Capitol provides support for 
any unveiling ceremony. 
9. Statue Removal/Installation and Owner-
ship Transfer. The State must arrange for a 
rigger approved by the Architect of the Cap-
itol to remove the replaced statue and in-
stall the replacement statue in the location 
of its unveiling. This work must be coordi-
nated with the Architect of the Capitol. 
The replaced statue must be removed 
shortly before the new statue is brought into 
the Capitol. Before the replaced statue is re-
moved, a document transferring ownership of 
that statue from the federal government to 
the State will be signed by the designated 
State official. 
10. Permanent Location. The permanent 
location for the replacement statue will be 
approved by the Joint Committee on the Li-
brary. The National Statuary Hall collection 
is located in several areas of the Capitol: Na-
tional Statuary Hall (the Old Hall of the 
House), the Rotunda, the second-floor House 
and Senate corridors, the Hall of Columns, 
the Crypt, and the Capitol Visitor Center. 
The Architect of the Capitol will make rec-
ommendations for placement of the new 
statue with the least possible disruption to 
previously placed statues while maintaining 
a harmonious arrangement. To assist in de-
veloping this recommendation, the agency’s 
structural engineer will determine whether 
the floor in any proposed location can safely 
support the weight of the statue. If the re-
placement statue is suitable in weight and 
dimensions, it will normally take the place 
of the replaced statue. If not, the Architect 
of the Capitol will, upon the approval of the 
Joint Committee on the Library and with 
the advice of the Commission of Fine Arts as 
requested, relocate statues within the Cap-
itol. 
If necessary, after the statue has been un-
veiled, the Architect of the Capitol will be 
responsible for moving it to the permanent 
location approved by the Joint Committee 
on the Library. 
Guidelines for Replacement Statues 
The guidelines below are provided for ref-
erence only; they may be modified in par-
ticular cases by the Joint Committee on the 
Library. Images of the one hundred statues 
now in the collection are available at the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol website (www.aoc.gov). 
Subject. The subject of the statue must be 
a deceased person who was a citizen of the 
United States and is illustrious for historic 
renown or for distinguished civic or military 
services. Statues may represent only one in-
dividual (ruling adopted by the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library at meeting of March 
13, 1950). Statues should represent the full 
length. 
Material. The statue must be made of mar-
ble or bronze. Replacement statues made of 
the same material as the replaced statue are 
preferred. Materials from domestic sources, 
including, as applicable, sources in the terri-
tories and possessions of the United States, 
are preferred. 
Pedestal. To reduce weight, the Architect 
of the Capitol recommends that the pedestal 
be made of a hollow steel frame faced in 
granite or other stone or be made of bronze. 
It is recommended that the pedestal be de-
signed and constructed with a removable 
panel (usually in the back) to allow access to 
attachment bolts. The pedestal design, di-
mensions, and weight must be submitted to 
the Architect of the Capitol for review. 
Inscriptions. Inscriptions on the pedestal 
should include the name of the State and of 
the individual represented. The preferred op-
tion is that inscriptions be carved. Alter-
natively, they can be raised or cast on a 
bronze plaque. It is traditional and preferred 
that inscriptions be simple and that they ap-
pear only on the front of the pedestal. The 
proposed inscription should be submitted for 
review and approval by the Joint Committee 
on the Library as part of the pedestal design. 
Size and Weight. In general, the figure in 
the replacement statue should be over life 
size, with a height between seven and eight 
feet, and the total height, including the ped-
estal, no greater than eleven feet. Within 
that size range, the combined weight of a 
bronze statue and its pedestal should not ex-
ceed 5,000 pounds; a marble statue and its 
pedestal should weigh no more than 10,000 
pounds. 
Patina and Coating. For bronze statues, 
the selected patina and coating must be eas-
ily maintained and repaired. Formulas for 
the patinating and coating materials must 
be provided to the Architect of the Capitol 
for use during future maintenance. 
Other Considerations. The statue and ped-
estal should not be a potential source of safe-
ty hazards. They should not have any pro-
truding or sharp element that could cause 
harm or be an obstacle for persons in the 
building. 
Relevant Legislation 
The law creating National Statuary Hall is 
the act of July 2, 1864 (2 U.S.C. §2131) (for-
merly 40 U.S.C. 187), which established that 
each State had the right to donate ‘‘statues, 
in marble or bronze, not exceeding two in 
number for each State, of deceased persons 
who have been citizens thereof, and illus-
trious for their historic renown or for distin-
guished civic or military services . . . .’’ 
This law was modified in 2000 by Sec. 311 of 
H.R. 5657 (included by reference in H.R. 4577) 
and established as law by P.L. 106–554, which 
provides that ‘‘Any state may request the 
Joint Committee on the Library of Congress 
to approve the replacement of a statue the 
State has provided for display in Statuary 
Hall in the Capitol of the United States 
. . . .’’ 2 U.S.C. § 2132. 
Supervision and direction of the collection 
are assigned to the Architect of the Capitol 
by the act of August 15, 1876 (19 Stat. 147), 2 
U.S.C. § 2131. 
With the approval of the congressional 
Joint Committee on the Library, the Archi-
tect of the Capitol is responsible for the re-
ception and location of the statues in this 
collection, first established by H. Con. Res. 
47, agreed to February 24, 1933, and included 
in P.L. 106–554. 2 U.S.C. § 2132. 
Excerpt From Public Law 106–554 
Sec. 311. (a)(1) Any State may request the 
Joint Committee on the Library of Congress 
to approve the replacement of a statue the 
State has provided for display in Statuary 
Hall in the Capitol of the United States 
under section 1814 of the Revised Statutes (40 
U.S.C. 187). 
(2) A request shall be considered under 
paragraph (1) only if— 
(A) the request has been approved by a res-
olution adopted by the legislature of the 
State and the request has been approved by 
the Governor of the State, and 
(B) the statue to be replaced has been dis-
played in the Capitol of the United States for 
at least 10 years as of the time the request is 
made, except that the Joint Committee may 
waive this requirement for cause at the re-
quest of a State. 
(b) If the Joint Committee on the Library 
of Congress approves a request under sub-
section (a), the Architect of the Capitol shall 
enter into an agreement with the State to 
carry out the replacement in accordance 
with the request and any conditions the 
Joint Committee may require for its ap-
proval. Such agreement shall provide that— 
(1) the new statue shall be subject to the 
same conditions and restrictions as apply to 
any statue provided by a State under section 
1814 of the Revised Statutes (40 U.S.C. 187),

(2) the State shall pay any costs related to 
the replacement, including costs in connec-
tion with the design, construction, transpor-
tation, and placement of the new statue, the 
removal and transportation of the statue 
being replaced, and any unveiling ceremony.

(2) If any statue is removed from the Cap-
itol of the United States as part of a transfer 
of ownership under paragraph (1), then it 
may not be returned to the Capitol for dis-
play unless such display is specifically au-
thorized by Federal law. 
(e) The Architect of the Capitol, upon the 
approval of the Joint Committee on the Li-
brary and with the advice of the Commission 
of Fine Arts as requested, is authorized and 
directed to relocate within the United States 
Capitol any of the statues received from the 
States under section 1814 of the Revised 
Statutes (40 U.S.C. 187) prior to the date of 
the enactment of this Act, and to provide for 
the reception, location, and relocation of the

Hon. ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson, Committee on House Administra-
tion, 
Washington, DC. 
CHAIRPERSON
LOFGREN: More than six 
months have passed since the start of the 
117th Congress, and it is our understanding 
that the Joint Committee of Congress on the 
Library (JCL) will officially organize next 
week. We are looking forward to the JCL’s 
first official action this year as there are 
pressing issues before the Joint Committee 
demanding our immediate attention. 
We encourage the following items be con-
sidered as some of the JCL’s first orders of 
business: 
Reopening of the U.S. Botanic Garden 
(USBG). The Joint Committee’s delayed or-
ganization has directly affected the public’s 
access to one of the Capitol campus’ main at-
tractions, the U.S. Botanic Garden, which to 
this day remains closed awaiting permission 
from the JCL to re-welcome visitors. We 
must take up this matter of business imme-
diately, as the USBG’s reopening plans and 
executive leadership team have informed 
oversight stakeholders of the campus’ readi-
ness for safe and immediate reopening. 
Consideration of the request by the State 
of North Carolina. The State of North Caro-
lina is anxiously awaiting JCL’s action on 
its request for the removal and replacement 
of one of the state’s contributions to the Na-
tional Statuary Hall Collection. Already 
years into this process, the request is await-
ing JCL approval and the Architect of the 
Capitol is ready to partner with us to move 
the process along. 
As members of the Joint Committee, we 
stand ready to get to work, while upholding 
the long tradition of bipartisanship and bi-
cameralism. As the incoming Chairperson, 
we encourage you to add the above items to 
the agenda of the JCL’s first organizing 
meeting so that we can begin to address 
these pressing issues. 
Sincerely, 
RODNEY DAVIS, 
Ranking Member, 
Committee on House Administration. 
BARRY LOUDERMILK, 
Member, 
Committee on House Administration. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I have a readout from the House Rules 
Committee meeting on H.R. 3005 re-
corded June 28, 2021, at which time the 
Joint Committee on the Library chair, 
ZOE LOFGREN, announced her approval 
of the Kansas longstanding request to 
update their contribution to be a stat-
ue of Amelia Earhart, and I thank the 
Congresswoman LOFGREN
for taking 
that direction. 
Madam Speaker, I have the official 
collection of correspondence from the 
State of Kansas to the Architect of the 
Capitol that informs them where Kan-
sas is in the 10-step replacement proc-
ess. 
Madam Speaker, that process began 
22 years ago in 1999, and I thank you 
for your indulgence with that. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to reit-
erate that there is much that was said 
here today that we are in agreement 
with. Something that the esteemed 
majority leader said I think needs to be 
reemphasized and is again the reason 
why I have adamantly fought to re-
place the statue of Stephens, the Geor-
gia statue of Alexander Stephens, be-
cause of his criticism of our Founders. 
His criticism was that they truly be-
lieved those ideas that were written in 
our Declaration of Independence that 
all men are created equal. In fact, he 
said that that was the flaw of our Na-
tion. 
That is why they rebelled against 
this Nation; that we should go back to 
those original principles and have peo-
ple here that honor the idea that God 
in His infinite ability, created all of us 
and He created us all with value, equal 
value regardless of skin color, regard-
less of age, regardless of any other fac-
tor; that we are all created in His di-
vine wisdom and given life, and life can 
be so abundant if we just hold on to 
these ideas and principles. And those 
statues that we have in this Capitol 
should reflect those values, and I can 
think of no one that reflects those val-
ues more than the Reverend Billy Gra-
ham. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the General Assembly of North 
Carolina bill requesting that the stat-
ues be replaced. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH 
CAROLINA SESSION 2015 
HOUSE BILL 540—RATIFIED BILL 
An act requesting the Joint Committee on 
the Library of Congress to approve the re-
placement of the statue of Charles Brantley 
Aycock in National Statuary Hall with a 
statue of the Reverend William Franklin 
‘‘Billy’’ Graham, Jr. 
Whereas, in 1864, Congress established Na-
tional Statuary Hall in the Old Hall of the 
House of Representatives in the United 
States Capitol, and authorized each state to 
contribute to the Hall two statues that rep-
resent important historical figures of each 
state; and 
Whereas, North Carolina currently has 
statues on display in the National Statuary 
Hall Collection of former governors Zebulon 
Vance and Charles Brantley Aycock given by 
the State in 1916 and 1932, respectively; and 
Whereas, in 2000, Congress enacted legisla-
tion authorizing states the ability to request 
that the Joint Committee on the Library of 
Congress approve the replacement of a stat-
ue the state had provided for display in Stat-
uary Hall; and 
Whereas, William Franklin ‘‘Billy’’ Gra-
ham, Jr., was born on November 7, 1918, to 
William 
Franklin 
Graham 
and 
Morrow 
Coffey Graham, and was reared on a dairy 
farm in Charlotte, North Carolina; and 
Whereas, Billy Graham attended the Flor-
ida Bible Institute from 1937 to 1940, grad-
uating 1940, and was ordained to the ministry 
in 1939; and 
Whereas, Billy Graham served as pastor of 
The Village Church in Western Springs, Illi-
nois, from 1943 to 1945; as a member of Youth 
for Christ International, where he ministered 
to young people and military personnel from 
1945 to 1950; and as President of North-
western Schools, a liberal arts college, Bible 
school, and theological seminary, from 1947 
to 1952; and 
Whereas, after World War II, Reverend 
Graham preached throughout the United 
States and Europe and attained inter-
national 
prominence 
as 
an 
evangelist 
through a series of crusades that began in 
1949; and 
Whereas, since 1950, Reverend Graham has 
conducted his ministry through the Billy 
Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), 
reaching multitudes of people by means of a 
weekly radio program, ‘‘Hour of Decision’’; a 
newspaper column, ‘‘My Answer’’; televised 
crusades; articles published in ‘‘Decision’’ 
magazine; and evangelistic films produced 
and distributed by World Wide Pictures and 
now reaching millions through the BGEA 
Web site and the Billy Graham Library in 
Charlotte; and 
Whereas, over the years, Reverend Graham 
has preached to live audiences of nearly 215 
million people in more than 185 countries 
and territories and has preached to an esti-
mated 2.2 billion people through television 
and technology; and

Whereas, Reverend Graham has been a re-
nowned humanitarian and philanthropist, 
providing financial assistance to victims of 
disasters, as well as collecting and distrib-
uting clothing to those in need all around 
the world over the years; and 
Whereas, Reverend Graham has counseled 
12 Presidents and has participated in nine 
presidential inaugurations; and 
Whereas, Reverend Graham has also coun-
seled world leaders and has participated in 
many historic occasions, and has been called 
upon as the ‘‘nation’s pastor’’ during times 
of national crisis. He spoke at the National 
Cathedral service in Washington, D.C., three 
days after the 9/11 attack in 2001, as the na-
tion and world watched and listened. Five 
presidents, including George W. Bush, Bill 
Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, 
and Gerald Ford, and their wives were in the 
audience; and 
Whereas, in 2012, Reverend Graham was 
listed on the ‘‘The Ten Most Admired Men in 
the World List’’ for the 56th time. He was 
first selected in 1955. According to the latest 
list, Reverend Graham was tied as Number 3 
with Mitt Romney, George W, Bush, and 
Pope Benedict XVI behind President Barack 
Obama and Nelson Mandela; and 
Whereas, admired and beloved by both 
Christians 
and 
non-Christians, 
Reverend 
Graham continues to inspire the world with 
his good works; and 
Whereas, there have been many great 
North Carolinians, but few have impacted 
the world more than Billy Graham; and . 
Whereas, it is appropriate to honor Rev-
erend Graham’s life and works by placing his 
likeness in the National Statuary Hall Col-
lection for display in the United States Cap-
itol; Now, therefore, 
The General Assembly of North Carolina 
enacts:

Representatives.

Governor. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Just a couple of clarifications be-
cause I think it may be confusing to 
the general public hearing about what 
is really a rather arcane process for 
States to add and remove statues. 
The Joint Committee on the Library 
ultimately approves it, but the process 
is driven by the States, the Architect 
of the Capitol does all of the heavy lift-
ing, looking at the statues, making 
sure that the replacement statue meets 
the engineering requirements and the 
like. I would just like to note that 
until last Wednesday, Senator ROY 
BLUNT was chair of the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, and I have been 
chair of the Joint Committee on the 
Library now for 6 days. 
b 1630 
In that time, I actually have ap-
proved the reopening of the Botanical 
Gardens. I have approved the replace-
ment of the Kansas statue that I re-
ceived the letter on Friday. And I have 
just received the information on North 
Carolina, and I plan to work on that 
very hard and, hopefully, very prompt-
ly get a decision. 
So I don’t think that speaks to undue 
delay in the 6 days that I have been 
chair of the Joint Committee on the 
Library. 
I do think it is important that we 
take the step to remove these Confed-
erates and segregationists and pro- 
slavery statues from our Statuary 
Hall. In some cases, States have either 
started the steps to remove them. But 
while that process is ongoing, these in-
dividuals are on a pedestal. And we 
cannot forget our history, but we don’t 
have to put segregationists and pro- 
slavery historical figures on a pedestal. 
We don’t honor them, although we do 
remember them. 
So let’s adopt this measure to deal 
with those statues. 
But there is another thing. There are 
situations such as the statue of Justice 
Taney that were not sent here by any 
State, and only we can remove them 
expeditiously. We have said, and we 
have heard from people more eloquent 
than I about why Justice Taney should 
not be honored. 
In 1865, a few years before the Taney 
bust was ultimately commissioned, the 
Senate debated it. They debated wheth-
er to commission the bust of Justice 
Taney for the Supreme Court room. 
And 
during 
that 
debate, 
Senator 
Charles Sumner of Massachusetts said 
this: ‘‘I object to that; that now an 
emancipated country should make a 
bust to the author of the Dred Scott 
decision. Judgment is beginning now; 
and an emancipated country will fasten 
upon him the stigma which he de-
serves.’’ 
Now, it may have taken longer than 
Senator Sumner envisioned, in fact, 156 
years to attach the stigma that be-
longs to Justice Taney, but we will at-
tach that stigma today if we pass this 
bill. 
In closing, I just want to say that all 
of us are here for a few years. Some 
longer, some shorter, but we are just 
here for a little slice of history. And I 
feel fortunate that my little slice of 
history allowed me to be here the same 
time as the late John Lewis. I can al-
most imagine him standing here on the 
floor. How fortunate I am to have 
served with him. And how fortunate I 
am to serve with our majority whip, 
Mr. CLYBURN, who put his body on the 
line to fight against segregation and to 
fight for voting rights. They are lead-
ers of our country. I am proud to serve 
with them. Let’s show how much we 
honor them by voting for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair LOFGREN for her leadership. I’d

also like to thank our Speaker, our Majority 
Leader, our Whip, Mr. CLYBURN, Chairwoman 
BEATTY, Chairman BENNIE
THOMPSON, and 
Congressman BUTTERFIELD
for moving this 
legislation forward with the urgency that it re-
quires. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3005, which 
will remove shameful monuments to slavery, 
segregation, and white supremacy from the 
U.S Capitol. In 2017, in the wake of the white 
nationalist rally in Charlottesville, I introduced 
the Confederate Monument Removal Act to 
remove all statues of people who voluntarily 
served the Confederacy from the Capitol build-
ing, so thank you for including this in this cur-
rent bill. Venerating those who took up arms 
against the United States to preserve slavery 
is an affront to the human dignity of all Ameri-
cans. 
These painful symbols of bigotry and racism 
have no place in our society and certainly 
should not be enshrined in the U.S. Capitol. 
Following our historic vote on Juneteenth, it is 
past time for Congress to stop glorifying the 
men who committed treason against the 
United States to keep African Americans in 
chains. 
The movement to honor Confederate sol-
diers was a deliberate act to rewrite history 
and diminish the role of slavery in the out-
break of hostilities between the North and the 
South. The Confederacy sought to uphold the 
institution of slavery and maintain a racial hier-
archy that brutalized and oppressed Black 
people. This ideology of white supremacy led 
to the rise of Confederate memorials in the 
20th century. Most Confederate statutes were 
erected during periods of extreme civil rights 
tension, not in the immediate aftermath of the 
Civil War. Placed in public spaces, they were 
testaments to the enduring notion of white su-
premacy and used to push back against the 
movement for equality for African Americans. 
They are symbols of white supremacy and ha-
tred, not Southern heritage. They don’t belong 
here in the U.S. Capitol. 
We are in a critical moment to act. The re-
moval of Confederate statues from the U.S. 
Capitol is an important step in confronting our 
nation’s painful legacy of slavery, racism, and 
oppression. As a descendant of enslaved Afri-
cans, I support this bill and I ask for an ‘aye’ 
vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 504, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and insert extra-
neous materials on H.R. 2662. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
I rise today to urge strong, bipar-
tisan support for my bill, H.R. 2662, the 
IG Independence and Empowerment 
Act. 
The work of inspectors general, who 
conduct independent oversight of Fed-
eral agencies, continues to be a re-
markable investment for American 
taxpayers. For every dollar we spend 
on IGs, we get $17 back. And this re-
turn could be even higher if we gave 
IGs additional tools, which is exactly 
what this bill would do. 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act is a package of critical re-
forms to protect IGs from political re-
taliation and obstruction. I want to 
thank Leader HOYER for his support 
and work on this bill, as well as all the 
other cosponsors of the legislation. 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act also has the support of 14 
good government groups. They wrote 
that the reforms in this legislation 
‘‘have been crafted to address problems 
with inspector general independence 
and authority long raised by Congress, 
civil society, and our inspectors gen-
eral. We strongly urge Congress to pass 
this legislation to empower our inde-
pendent watchdogs to serve the public 
even more effectively.’’ 
This bill would enhance the inde-
pendence of IGs in several ways. Most 
importantly, it would protect IGs from 
being fired simply for doing their jobs. 
The bill would only allow an IG to be 
removed for a documented cause, based 
on a defined list of nonpartisan rea-
sons, such as a knowing violation of

the law, abuse of authority, or gross 
mismanagement. 
These 
removal 
protections 
come 
from a bill I introduced last year, after 
the previous administration bullied, 
sidelined, and retaliated against mul-
tiple IGs. 
Last April and May, in six short 
weeks, President Trump fired or side-
lined four IGs and acting IGs who were 
simply doing their jobs. 
On April 3, intelligence community 
IG Michael Atkinson was fired after he 
provided a whistleblower complaint to 
Congress about President Trump’s now 
infamous call with Ukrainian Presi-
dent, part of the conduct for which he 
was impeached by this body. 
On April 7, President Trump removed 
Glenn Fine as Acting Defense Depart-
ment IG, which blocked IG Fine from 
serving as chair of the Pandemic Re-
sponse Accountability Committee, a 
committee I helped create in the 
CARES Act to oversee trillions of dol-
lars in Federal spending in response to 
the coronavirus pandemic. IG Fine was 
simply doing his job. 
On May 15, President Trump removed 
Mitch Behm as the Acting Transpor-
tation Department IG and replaced him 
with an agency insider. Mr. Behm was 
investigating Secretary of Transpor-
tation Elaine Chao at the time. 
And, finally, that same day, Presi-
dent Trump fired State Department IG 
Steve Linick, who, at the time, was in-
vestigating Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo for abuse of power and misuse 
of resources, and replaced him with a 
political crony. 
All four of these IGs were just fol-
lowing the law and the facts, yet they 
faced blatant retaliation. This is just 
plain wrong. 
President Trump’s actions struck at 
the heart of why we have IGs, to pro-
vide independent oversight and a check 
on executive branch waste, fraud, and 
abuse. 
No President should be allowed to re-
taliate against an IG for simply doing 
their jobs, and the IG Independence and 
Empowerment Act would ensure that 
IGs are protected from this kind of re-
taliation. 
In a letter to congressional leader-
ship after the IG firings by Mr. Trump, 
nine former IGs wrote and said: ‘‘Forc-
ing inspectors general to choose be-
tween doing their jobs with integrity 
and keeping their positions is not an 
acceptable model of governance and 
oversight. We therefore urge you to 
pass for-cause removal protections for 
all IGs.’’ 
In addition, the IG Independence and 
Empowerment Act would ensure tem-
porary, acting IGs are independent and 
qualified by requiring the acting IG to 
be the deputy IG in the same office, or 
another senior official from the IG 
community if there is no deputy. This 
would protect against the appointment 
of acting IGs with conflicts of interest 
or who are acting as political ap-
pointees. 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act would further bolster IG 
independence by requiring notification 
to Congress before an IG is pushed 
aside and placed on non-duty status so 
that we in Congress can support the 
independence of IGs. 
The bill would also empower IGs by 
granting them the authority to sub-
poena nongovernment witnesses to pro-
vide testimony. In many investiga-
tions, testimony from nongovernment 
witnesses is essential. So providing IGs 
with this authority is often the only 
way 
to 
root 
out 
fraud 
or 
other 
wrongdoings. 
In 2016, our former colleague, Mark 
Meadows, supported a similar provision 
and highlighted that bill’s procedural 
safeguards, which are essentially the 
same in the bill we are considering 
today. 
He stated: ‘‘This bill provides the ex-
panded authority that the IGs have 
asked for, but with safeguards in place 
to make sure that they protect against 
the possibility that an IG’s investiga-
tion would interfere with an ongoing 
criminal investigation, or do other 
harm.’’ 
b 1645 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act would also close a loophole 
that prevents the Department of Jus-
tice IG from initiating investigations 
into professional misconduct by DOJ 
attorneys. 
This bill balances enhanced authori-
ties and independence with new ac-
countability and transparency meas-
ures for IGs. 
For example, the bill contains the bi-
partisan Integrity Committee Trans-
parency Act, which would require 
greater transparency from the CIGIE 
Integrity Committee, the body Con-
gress set up to investigate IGs. 
Supporting IG independence has long 
been a bipartisan issue. Congress must 
act now to protect and empower IGs so 
that they can perform the duties Con-
gress has entrusted to them without 
being retaliated against. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port the IG Independence and Em-
powerment Act and continue the bipar-
tisan 
tradition 
of 
protecting 
and 
strengthening IGs. 
To my Republican colleagues who 
may say these efforts are about attack-
ing President Trump, I would respond 
with this: Joe Biden is the President 
now. 
I am supporting good governments 
reforms under a Democratic adminis-
tration because I believe in account-
ability no matter who the President is 
and what party they come from. 
We are talking about the future. This 
is 
about 
safeguarding 
taxpayers’ 
money and protecting the integrity of 
our government. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will support these critical re-
forms as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, through their work, 
inspectors general help improve gov-
ernment efficiency and effectiveness. 
Their nonpartisan audits and inves-
tigations work to root out waste, 
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in 
all Federal agencies. In fact, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform and 
IGs have this common mission, but IGs 
occupy a unique spot within the Fed-
eral Government. They have a respon-
sibility to their respective agency and 
to Congress through the notice require-
ments. 
When the political parties of the ex-
ecutive branch and Congress are dif-
ferent, political fights can understand-
ably erupt. Unfortunately, this has re-
cently led to a politicization of IG in-
vestigations. 
That takes us to today’s bill. Many 
provisions in this bill are a step in the 
right direction to empower IGs to con-
duct robust oversight. However, I re-
main concerned about some of the pro-
visions in this bill. 
Title I in this bill would unneces-
sarily constrain the President’s ability 
to remove an IG, shifting the delicate 
balance between the executive branch 
and Congress. Maintaining the current 
balance would enable Congress to use 
its own oversight authority if it be-
lieves there is wrongdoing by the Presi-
dent or an agency head in the removal 
of an IG. 
Next, in title III, the majority has 
proposed to dramatically limit who can 
be appointed as an acting inspector 
general if the IG has voluntarily left 
office or been removed. In doing so, 
this hinders the President’s ability to 
appoint an IG with whom they have 
confidence. 
While there are legitimate concerns 
about IGs serving at multiple agencies, 
this provision goes too far in limiting 
the President’s authority over a subset 
of executive branch employees. 
Finally, I have serious concerns with 
title V, the provision authorizing an 
inspector general to issue testimonial 
subpoena authorities to compel testi-
mony from former Federal employees. 
While it may be helpful for IGs to in-
vestigate certain allegations of mis-
conduct, it also provides IGs with a 
tool that can be easily abused for polit-
ical purposes. For example, this au-
thority would enable new Biden-ap-
pointed inspectors general to subpoena 
former Trump administration officials 
under the guise of any investigation, 
regardless of the real purpose for the 
investigation. 
Finally, this provision does not pro-
vide the necessary protections for 
former Federal employees who may be 
subjected to the legal fees of dealing 
with a subpoena, instead forcing them 
to pay for counsel to defend against 
and respond to these subpoenas. With-
out meaningful protections to ensure 
that testimonial subpoena authority 
would not be used to seek out political 
retribution, I cannot support this pro-
vision. 
Rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, mis-
management, and misconduct is one of

the most important jobs of this com-
mittee, and inspectors general serve on 
the front lines with us in this mission. 
We must ensure that all of our inspec-
tors general have the tools they need 
to conduct robust oversight of their re-
spective agencies. 
That is why committee Republicans 
offered multiple amendments at the 
markup to address these concerns but 
still empower our IGs. We again offered 
compromise amendments at the Rules 
Committee yesterday, but my Demo-
crat colleagues have only allowed one 
of these amendments to be made in 
order. 
I am hopeful that Democrats will 
take the opportunity to pass a major 
bipartisan bill by adopting this amend-
ment. If they choose to continue down 
their partisan path, I hope my Demo-
crat colleagues can stop the repeated 
attacks on the Trump administration. 
Instead, we should focus on ensuring 
our inspectors general are focused on 
and equipped to conduct robust over-
sight 
over 
agency 
operations 
and 
spending. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the distinguished majority leader of 
the House, an important leader on this 
legislation, and a steadfast leader on 
this and on so many issues before this 
body. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Chairwoman MALONEY’s lead-
ership on this issue and so many other 
issues to protect the citizens, protect 
consumers, protect voters, and protect, 
frankly, those who stand up and say 
there is wrongdoing. 
I heard the remarks of the ranking 
member, and I appreciate his thought-
fulness. But as I was listening to him, 
I am thinking: How do you make sure 
that somebody is not cowed by a Presi-
dent, any President, who is prepared to 
take adverse action without cause 
against somebody because he or she 
does not like the investigation they are 
undertaking? 
As the gentleman may know, and as 
my colleagues may know, I urged a 
rule that we adopted in this House 
which said that it is a violation of our 
rules to out a whistleblower. We have 
put whistleblower protections in, but 
unfortunately, when we had whistle-
blowers come forward most recently, 
they were attacked and attempted to 
be outed, which would have subjected 
them, obviously, to the adverse con-
sequences against which we tried to 
protect them in the legislation that we 
passed on whistleblowing. So, I see 
some analogy between these two. 
I thank Vice Chairman GOMEZ, Chair-
man CONNOLLY, Chairman LYNCH, and 
Representatives PORTER and LIEU for 
working on this legislation and sup-
porting this legislation. I was proud to 
introduce it with the chair of the com-
mittee and proud to support it. 
Madam Speaker, Americans deserve 
the highest standards of ethics, trans-
parency, and accountability from their 
government. Federal agencies and offi-
cials work for the people, and they 
must be accountable to the people. 
That is why the previous administra-
tion’s assault on the independence of 
inspectors general was so alarming. 
This is not an attack on a specific ad-
ministration. As the gentlewoman and 
chair of the committee has pointed 
out, we have a Democratic President 
now, so this is going to bind him. It is 
not going to bind his predecessors. If 
anything, it is certainly not anti- 
Biden, but it is to say: President Biden, 
we respect you, but we want to have in-
spectors general who have the con-
fidence they can move ahead without 
fear of retribution. 
Former President Trump removed or 
replaced, as has been pointed out, the 
inspectors general from the Depart-
ments of Defense, State, Health and 
Human Services, and Transportation. 
What kind of a check and balance is 
that, if a President can simply say, ‘‘I 
don’t like what you are doing. I am re-
moving you’’? I would suggest none, 
with all due respect to my friend. 
These watchdogs must be able to act 
independently and be free from polit-
ical pressure or threats to their ca-
reers. It seems to me that is a very 
commonsense, rational judgment to 
make. That is what this is about. 
We introduced our bill to address the 
challenge exposed by the actions of the 
prior administration, that is true. But 
that has not been the only administra-
tion that has acted to undermine in-
spectors general. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join us 
in supporting this legislation today. It 
will build on the provisions that I 
pushed to include in the House Rules 
Committee, as I pointed out in Janu-
ary, which protects Federal whistle-
blowers by making it a violation of 
House rules for Members to reveal 
their identities. 
Those who come forward to reveal 
misconduct or violations of the public 
trust need to be heard and must be pro-
tected from threats of retaliation. If 
that is not the case, it will undermine 
the very objective that we seek in cre-
ating IGs. They need to know that they 
can go to inspectors general or to Con-
gress under strong whistleblower pro-
tections. 
House Democrats, and I hope House 
Republicans, will renew the faith in 
government and ensure that it works 
for the people. We are determined to 
protect and strengthen government ac-
countability. 
I hope all of us, in a bipartisan way, 
will repair this very critical principle 
of accountability for the people of this 
country. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GOMEZ), the vice chair of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the IG Independence and 
Empowerment Act. 
This comprehensive legislation would 
ensure inspectors general have the 
tools needed to conduct thorough in-
vestigations without fear of political 
retaliation. 
Many of these reforms have had 
strong bipartisan support for years, in 
particular, my bill, the IG Subpoena 
Authority Act. This provision grants 
IGs the authority to subpoena testi-
mony from former employees and con-
tractors as a tool to better undercover 
waste, fraud, and abuse. Currently, the 
absence of such authority hinders the 
ability of OIGs to conduct complete 
oversight in matters of corruption and 
injustice. 
I know my Republican colleagues 
claim this authority has no protections 
from abuse, but that simply is not 
true. This bill includes safeguards to 
ensure that this authority is not 
abused by requiring that an IG must 
have a subpoena approved by a panel of 
three other IGs. 
Additionally, I understand my Re-
publican colleague may introduce an 
amendment that would strike the sub-
poena authority provision from this 
bill today. I find this interesting and 
confusing because the IG Subpoena Au-
thority Act was first introduced in the 
115th Congress by Republican Congress-
man Steve Russell with the support of 
then-Chairman Towns and Ranking 
Member ISSA, and it passed the House 
by unanimous consent. 
This bill has not changed substan-
tially since the 115th Congress. What 
has changed is the political context in 
which we are trying to pass this re-
form. If a reform was good for govern-
ment then, it is a reform that is good 
for 
government 
now. 
Nothing 
has 
changed. 
Madam Speaker, we need to make 
sure that the IG Subpoena Authority 
Act is included and passed today. That 
will help strengthen the integrity and 
maintain the accountability in our 
Federal agencies. 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY for its 
inclusion in the IG Independence and 
Empowerment Act. It is a step forward 
for good government, and I strongly 
encourage an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PORTER), the vice chair of 
the Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations of the Oversight Committee. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, the 
Inspector General Independence and 
Empowerment Act protects our Na-
tion’s government watchdogs. 
Inspectors general are independent 
officials responsible for preventing and 
detecting waste, fraud, and abuse. They 
safeguard the interests of taxpayers 
and weed out corruption. We need 
stronger protections to prevent biased 
or unqualified acting inspectors gen-
eral from assuming these vital roles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3282 
June 29, 2021 
I championed such measures in my 
Accountability 
for 
Acting 
Officials 
Act, and I am proud to say they are in-
cluded in the chairwoman’s bill. These 
provisions would forbid dual-hatting, 
serving as both a political appointee 
and an acting inspector general at the 
same agency. This conflict of interest 
compromises the independence of the 
inspector general’s work. 
American taxpayers fund these agen-
cies. They deserve to know that those 
agencies are working on their behalf. 
They deserve inspectors general who 
will fight to protect their dollars and 
our government’s integrity. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support the Inspector Gen-
eral Independence and Empowerment 
Act. 
I thank Chair MALONEY for her lead-
ership on government integrity, includ-
ing this important bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from California for her 
amendment, her hard work on this bill, 
and 
her 
leadership 
on 
the 
sub-
committee and committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Government Operations. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2662, the 
IG Independence and Empowerment 
Act. I want to thank the chairwoman 
of the committee for her leadership, es-
pecially in bringing forward this im-
portant legislative package to bolster 
the independence and protection of 
oversight of Federal inspectors general 
while holding them more accountable 
to Congress and the American people 
at the same time. 
Our Subcommittee on Government 
Operations held a hearing in April that 
highlighted the need for this legisla-
tion. At the hearing, we discussed how 
the former President, Mr. Trump, ex-
ploited statutory loopholes repeatedly 
to attack Federal IGs, firing well-re-
spected IGs for investigating policies of 
political allies he liked. 
President Trump also appointed po-
litical agency officials to serve as act-
ing IGs, this double-hatting Ms. POR-
TER just talked about. This legislation 
would address that. We cannot allow 
these actions to be repeated. 
IGs are unique in the Federal Gov-
ernment, serving to root out waste, 
fraud, abuse, and gross mismanage-
ment. They report both to the execu-
tive and legislative branches of govern-
ment. This bill bolsters IGs on both 
fronts. 
Importantly, the bill ensures the 
President or an agency head can re-
move an IG only for documented cause, 
and I think that is a very important 
new standard. This measure will ensure 
that IGs can be removed when appro-
priate and cannot be removed simply 
because they speak truth to power. 
I authored two additional provisions 
included in this legislation. The first, 
the Integrity Committee Transparency 
Act, is a bipartisan provision I drafted 
with my ranking member, Mr. HICE. 
This provision would codify and en-
hance 
administrative 
reporting 
re-
forms at the Integrity Committee. Just 
this week, we saw how important that 
can be. 
It would also require the Integrity 
Committee to report immediately any 
particularly serious and flagrant prob-
lems, abuses, or deficiencies at the Of-
fice of Inspector General to the IG of 
that office. 
Importantly, the provision also ex-
pands the membership of the Integrity 
Committee to include a former inspec-
tor general, increasing acumen and ac-
countability and some distance. 
These are critical measures nec-
essary in the wake of cases in which 
the Integrity Committee has some-
times fallen short in its reporting to 
this body, to the Congress. In one re-
cent allegation of wrongdoing, it took 
nearly 4 years for the Integrity Com-
mittee to complete its investigation, 
and employees at that office continued 
to struggle under an IG who conducted 
herself with clear negligence. That 
case got resolved today with the an-
nouncement that that IG is going to 
retire. 
IGs cannot afford to be poor leaders, 
nor can we afford to have them be poor 
leaders. They must be model Federal 
employees if their credibility and in-
tegrity are to be trusted. 
We also champion title VII of this 
bill, the Enhanced Whistleblower En-
gagement Act. This provision requires 
OIG employees to undergo whistle-
blower training, mandates engagement 
between a designated whistleblower co-
ordinator 
and 
the 
Integrity 
Com-
mittee, and requires CIGIE to identify 
best practices for the timely and appro-
priate handling of alleged reprisals 
within an OIG. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield the gen-
tleman such time as he may consume. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, 
this measure is nearly identical to a bi-
partisan provision in the Senate craft-
ed by Republican Senator GRASSLEY 
from Iowa. 
In addition to these provisions, the 
bill includes several other important 
measures to bolster the independence 
of our nonpartisan watchdogs. This bill 
is an important bill in reasserting the 
independence, 
accountability, 
and 
transparency of IGs. They are a critical 
part of making this government work 
and rebuilding American trust in its 
government. 
I thank the distinguished chair-
woman for her leadership in bringing 
this bill before us. I urge Members on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, first, I would 
like to recognize the hard work of the 
chairman of the subcommittee. He au-
thored two proposals that were in-
cluded in the bill and was a major lead-
er on it. I thank Mr. CONNOLLY. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties of the Oversight Committee 
and a member of the Select Sub-
committee on the Coronavirus Crisis of 
the Oversight Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chair MALONEY for her wonder-
ful leadership of the Oversight Com-
mittee. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2662, the In-
spector General Independence and Em-
powerment Act. 
The inspectors general are a remark-
able innovation in American Govern-
ment that have saved us untold billions 
of dollars and checked the corrupt 
abuse of power by people controlling 
Federal departments. They are essen-
tial to our ability to legislate as the 
Article I branch and to do meaningful 
oversight over the executive branch of 
government. 
That is true in general, but it is espe-
cially true when we have a President 
like Donald Trump who categorically 
refused to recognize congressional sub-
poenas, blocked members of his admin-
istration from coming to testify before 
Congress in an unprecedented way, and 
generally refused to cooperate with 
congressional factfinding at all. 
When a President refuses to cooper-
ate with the legislative branch, when 
he obstructs Congress at every turn, 
the IGs are our only source of informa-
tion. It is imperative that we protect 
our inspectors general’s independence 
and their impartiality so they will not 
be reduced to the level of being Presi-
dential sycophants who are party loy-
alists. 
The Supreme Court has recognized 
the importance of IG independence, 
noting that it is ‘‘vital to effectuating 
Congress’ intent and maintaining an 
opportunity for objective inquiries into 
bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse, and 
mismanagement.’’ 
This bill will ensure that the IGs 
have the tools that they need to con-
duct thorough investigations on behalf 
of the American people, and it will pro-
tect them from unjust political retalia-
tion. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am excited to lis-
ten to the enthusiasm from my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
and their newfound passion for over-
sight. The Republicans on the Over-
sight Committee have been asking for 
many hearings on many different areas 
of potential oversight, potential waste, 
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in 
the Federal Government. But thus far, 
in this new Congress, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle have only been 
interested in oversight of the previous 
administration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3283 
June 29, 2021 
I am getting really excited for the 
taxpayers of America because I feel 
like, today, I am hearing that my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
are interested in ensuring that there is 
good government, that we have trans-
parency. 
One thing that I would like to men-
tion in this bill is that the Oversight 
Committee is responsible for oversight, 
and we want to work with the inspec-
tors general. We have a lot of agree-
ment in this bill, and I will talk about 
that during my closing remarks. But I 
do believe there is the potential for us 
to compromise and have a bipartisan 
bill that actually might have a chance 
to become law down the hall. 
But I hope that this newfound enthu-
siasm for oversight will carry over, and 
we can do what the Oversight Com-
mittee is supposed to do and not rely 
as heavily on unelected bureaucrats. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman, my dear friend and colleague, 
for having great enthusiasm for over-
sight and combating waste, fraud, and 
abuse. I would respectfully offer to him 
that the best way to conduct that is to 
give the power to the IGs to conduct le-
gitimate investigations. What we have 
seen is that when there comes a legiti-
mate investigation, they are often 
moved 
aside, 
fired, 
or 
retaliated 
against. 
So, I welcome the gentleman’s enthu-
siasm. I hope he will join with me in 
supporting giving the power to IGs to 
conduct legitimate investigations of 
waste, fraud, and abuse. 
As I said in my opening remarks, for 
every dollar we spend on IGs, we get 
back $17, really hundreds of millions of 
dollars back from their oversight and 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I want to remind 
the gentleman, as he knows from our 
hearings, there are many provisions in 
this bill that are bipartisan, several 
that Mr. CONNOLLY just mentioned that 
we were working on. I look forward to 
working with him and passing this bill. 
It should be bipartisan. Oversight 
and accountability should be bipar-
tisan. I hope the gentleman joins us in 
voting for this important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
SPEIER), the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Military Personnel of the Armed 
Services Committee. She also serves on 
the Oversight and Reform Committee 
and is the co-chair of the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, the 
history of whistleblowing dates back to 
the founding of this country. The Con-
tinental Congress was committed to 
making sure that whistleblowers would 
have a voice. Last year alone, $2.2 bil-
lion was saved by the taxpayers be-
cause of whistleblowers in our govern-
ment. 
The April massacre of IGs was an un-
precedented power play by the Presi-
dent, a ruthless President who some-
how thought they worked for him. 
They don’t work for him. They didn’t 
work for him. They work for the Amer-
ican people, and that is why, since the 
founding of this country, we have been 
so committed to it. 
Today’s legislation will protect IGs 
from retaliation and increase their 
independence, ensuring they operate 
free from political interference. Those 
complaints that those IGs were looking 
at were brought to them by individ-
uals. It was a political move by the 
President to fire them. 
I am interested that my colleague on 
the other side of the aisle was con-
cerned about the costs of being rep-
resented by counsel when someone who 
is a Federal employee is called in to 
testify. Maybe we can work on a bill to 
make sure that every Federal em-
ployee has that benefit. No one talked 
about 
that 
when 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was called in to testify or 
National Security Advisor Fiona Hill 
or Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, all of 
whom had to pick up the tab for the at-
torneys representing them. 
Last month during a hearing before 
the Oversight Subcommittee on Gov-
ernment Operations, the current Chair 
of the Council of the Inspectors Gen-
eral, Inspector General Allison Lerner, 
testified that while they offer multiple 
trainings for IGs, the trainings are not 
mandated. 
I believe, without mandated training, 
it is impossible to ensure that IGs are 
operating at the highest level and are 
well-equipped to carry out their duties, 
so I am pleased that my amendment re-
quiring minimum standards and best 
practices for training IGs has been in-
cluded in this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, may I inquire 
how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 81⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Kentucky has 231⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, JACKIE SPEIER, for her tremen-
dous work on this bill, and one of the 
major provisions was a bill of hers that 
was incorporated into it. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), a 
newly elected Member from the great 
State of North Carolina and a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of the Inspec-
tor General Independence Act. Inspec-
tors general are vital to the integrity, 
efficiency, and efficacy of our Govern-
ment. It is crucial that they operate 
free from political influence. 
This critical legislation includes a bi-
partisan bill I introduced, the Inspec-
tor General Access Act, which grants 
the inspector general of the Depart-
ment of Justice the authority to inves-
tigate misconduct by DOJ attorneys. 
The DOJ inspector general is cur-
rently the only Federal inspector gen-
eral without this authority. This is 
simply unacceptable. 
DOJ attorneys wield a tremendous 
amount of power, including the ability 
to make life and death decisions. It is 
crucial that these attorneys are held to 
the highest level of professionalism, 
and that their actions and conduct are 
subject to independent oversight. 
For this reason, I wholeheartedly 
support the Inspector General Inde-
pendence Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Just a couple of things I want to 
make sure that everyone understands 
with respect to this bill. This bill is a 
combination of 10 different bills. Re-
publicans support seven of the 10 bills. 
Seven of the 10 bills we could pass pret-
ty close to unanimously in this Cham-
ber that would strengthen the IGs and 
not hamper a President’s ability to ter-
minate an IG that may not agree with 
their ideology. 
No one in Congress would hire a 
staffer that adamantly opposed their 
ideology. No one in the private sector 
would have a staffer be a spokesperson 
or an employee that fundamentally dis-
agreed with the direction that person 
wanted to lead their company. And the 
same should be true with the President 
of the United States. 
With respect to President Trump’s 
termination of inspectors general, I 
want to mention a couple of termi-
nations that the President did. Presi-
dent Trump removed the Intelligence 
Community Inspector General Michael 
Atkinson because he flaunted strict 
whistleblower procedures to provide 
the Ukraine whistleblower report to 
Chairman SCHIFF. 
Now, we support good government. 
We want to protect whistleblowers. We 
want to encourage whistleblowers to 
come forward. ADAM SCHIFF did more 
to damage prospective whistleblowers 
than any Member of this body. And the 
IG was complicit with him in that. 
That was a rightful termination by 
President Trump. 
Acting 
Inspector 
General 
Christi 
Grimm purposely released an outdated 
and misleading report claiming there 
were shortages of medical equipment 
at hospitals which was found to be en-
tirely inaccurate and likely was politi-
cally motivated. That is why President 
Trump terminated her. 
So there are examples of a President 
rightfully terminating an inspector 
general, and I don’t think that this bill 
is the right path to move forward. This 
is overlegislating. 
We are passing a lot of bills out of 
this Chamber that are dead upon ar-
rival in the Senate. When we pass a bill 
that 
has 
bipartisan 
support, 
that 
makes a difference in the Senate. We

could achieve that, and I have an 
amendment that goes a long way to-
wards making this bill bipartisan. 
So with respect to oversight, I think 
the American people are upset over 
COVID–19. Speaker PELOSI created a 
Select Committee on the Coronavirus 
Crisis, which is a subsidiary of the 
House Oversight Committee, we share 
the same staff. We have been asking for 
hearings on the origins of COVID–19 
and had no response, no luck from my 
friends across the aisle, so we had a 
hearing today. We had a forum. And it 
was very productive. And I think the 
people of America appreciated that. 
That is oversight. 
So our committee can go a lot fur-
ther with respect to oversight, and I 
think that we could come to a bipar-
tisan compromise to strengthen the 
IGs without politicizing the IGs, with-
out hampering a President’s ability to 
get rid of a bad IG. 
I strongly oppose this bill. I hope 
through the amendment process it can 
get better, that it can pass in a bipar-
tisan manner, and we can strengthen 
the IGs, and we can send a message to 
the Senate that we have a bipartisan 
bill that you should take up and Presi-
dent Biden can hopefully sign into law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Independence is the bedrock principle 
of inspectors general, and this legisla-
tion would protect and enhance their 
critical work. 
As I mentioned earlier, this legisla-
tion has the support of several non-
partisan, good government groups, in-
cluding the Project on Government 
Oversight, the Government Account-
ability Project, Taxpayers for Common 
Sense, and many, many others. It also 
contains several bipartisan bills that 
are part of the overall inspector gen-
eral reform bill. I ask that the support 
letters from the good government 
groups be included in the RECORD. 
JUNE 28, 2021. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned 
organizations write to express our support 
for the IG Independence and Empowerment 
Act (H.R. 2662) and to urge you to vote for 
this critical legislation. 
Our federal inspectors general (IGs) iden-
tify and investigate waste, fraud, and abuse 
within the executive branch. The importance 
of their work cannot be overstated. Execu-
tive branch officials and Members of Con-
gress from both sides of the aisle rely on 
oversight conducted by inspectors general to 
inform their policy-making. These watch-
dogs continually return substantial savings 
for taxpayers. In fiscal year 2020 alone, in-
spectors general identified potential savings 
of approximately $53 billion. And perhaps 
most importantly, inspectors general inves-
tigate and expose abuses of power that may 
infringe on constitutional rights. 
If enacted, this legislation would address 
critical weaknesses in laws that have limited 
the effectiveness and threatened the inde-
pendence of these watchdogs. 
For example, most inspectors general lack 
the authority to compel former agency offi-
cials, subcontractors, or subgrantees to co-
operate with IG investigations. This has lim-
ited the ability of our watchdogs to effec-
tively review federal programs for waste and 
fraud and to investigate federal employees 
accused of misconduct. The IG Independence 
and Empowerment Act would address this by 
giving inspectors general the authority to 
compel testimony from former agency offi-
cials, subcontractors, or grantees where that 
testimony would be relevant to ongoing in-
vestigations. 
Another weakness is that the president can 
fire these watchdogs and replace them with 
unqualified or conflicted individuals, expos-
ing the work of these offices to unnecessary 
political interference. The public and Con-
gress depend on inspectors general to ensure 
our federal agencies are functioning effec-
tively, but these watchdogs must be con-
fident they will not be fired for doing that 
job well. As nine former inspectors general 
recently wrote to Congress, ‘‘Forcing inspec-
tors general to choose between doing their 
jobs with integrity and keeping their posi-
tions is not an acceptable model of govern-
ance and oversight.’’ The IG Independence 
and Empowerment Act places reasonable 
limits on when a president can remove an in-
spector general and who can serve in the 
event of a vacancy, and will further insulate 
the critical oversight offices from politics. 
There are many other critical reforms in 
this comprehensive legislation that have 
been crafted to address problems with in-
spector general independence and authority 
long raised by Congress, civil society, and 
our inspectors general. We strongly urge 
Congress to pass this legislation to empower 
our independent watchdogs to serve the pub-
lic even more effectively.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. The reforms we are considering 
today are only one part of the work 
Congress needs to prevent future Presi-
dents from abusing power. I also 
strongly support the broad Protecting 
Our Democracy Act, which Chairman 
SCHIFF has spearheaded, and I look for-
ward to that bill’s consideration very 
soon. 
I do want to say that the Select Com-
mittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, un-
like the description from my good 
friend and colleague, has held 15 hear-
ings of oversight. They have disclosed 
and recovered millions of dollars of il-
legal spending or corrupt spending. 
There is a hearing tomorrow, which 
will be the 16th hearing of the com-
mittee, and we welcome you to join us 
at that subcommittee hearing if you so 
wish. 
The inspector general community 
just, in general, has been attacked in 
recent years. By passing this IG Inde-
pendence and Empowerment Act, Con-
gress would send a strong message in 
the strongest terms that no adminis-
tration, regardless of President or 
party, can bully or retaliate or act 
against an IG when the IG is doing 
their job. They can only be removed for 
just cause, such as violating the law or 
gross mismanagement. 
In passing this legislation, we will be 
strengthening our democracy, and we 
will send a strong message that Con-
gress supports accountability and an 
effective government. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. It should be a bipar-
tisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

for debate has expired.

tors General; and 
(B) ensuring that Inspectors General meet 
relevant standards for integrity and inde-
pendence; and 
(3) issue a report— 
(A) on the results of the review required by 
paragraph (1); and 
(B) that contains any recommendations 
identified under paragraph (2). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) each will 
control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, the amendment 
offered by Congresswoman CINDY AXNE 
would increase transparency when an 
inspector general is removed. 
This amendment would require the 
President or independent agency head 
to provide Congress a detailed case-spe-
cific explanation when firing an IG. 
The amendment would also require 
the President or independent agency 
head to provide to Congress the find-
ings from an inquiry that led to the 
IG’s removal. 
These requirements would enhance 
IG independence in addition to the crit-
ical for-cause removal protections al-
ready in the bill. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
woman CAROLYN BOURDEAUX would en-
hance training requirements for inspec-
tors general. 
This amendment would ensure that 
IGs are trained in an important aspect 
of their oversight work over Federal 
contractors. 
The suspension and debarment proc-
ess provides an essential tool to hold 
Federal contractors accountable for 
waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Federal procurement law and the sus-
pension and debarment processes are 
highly complex, and it is important 
that all IGs are well-versed on these 
issues. 
This training will help make IGs 
even more effective and efficient and 
could lead to more taxpayer savings. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man TROY CARTER would ensure IGs 
are paid at an equitable level with sen-
ior staff in their office. 
Through an unintended consequence 
in current law, IGs are sometimes paid 
less than the senior staff in their own 
offices. This inequity could lead to dif-
ficulty in attracting the most qualified 
people to be IGs. 
This amendment would add language 
to current law providing that IGs have 
to be paid at least the same rate of pay 
as the highest paid employee in the 
IG’s office. 
This simple change would help ensure 
that IGs are paid what they deserve for 
the critical work they perform. 
b 1730 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man TOM MALINOWSKI would balance 
notification to Congress with the need 
to address an immediate threat. 
The base bill would require that the 
President or an independent agency 
head would notify Congress at least 30 
days before placing an IG on non-duty 
status. 
This amendment would make an ex-
ception to that requirement if any 
delay in that placement would mean a 
threat to people, property, or an ongo-
ing investigation. 
This amendment would give the 
President or agency head flexibility in 
the case of a documented threat, while 
ensuring Congress is notified of any 
change to an IG status in advance 
whenever possible. 
And, finally, an amendment offered 
by 
Congressman 
RITCHIE
TORRES, 
which would provide a needed review of 
all processes to ensure IGs are held ac-
countable. 
This amendment would require the 
Government Accountability Office to 
review existing processes for inves-
tigating allegations of IG wrongdoing, 
including the processes of the CIGIE 
Integrity Committee. The results of 
this review would provide Congress 
with critical information to know how 
well these processes are working and 
how to improve them, if needed. 
IGs provide a critical check on waste, 
fraud, and abuse in the government, 
and their own conduct must be above 
reproach. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to adopt this commonsense 
package of amendments, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the amendments en bloc. 
Madam Speaker, some of the amend-
ments in the proposed package attempt 
to be helpful and improve the bill, but 
most are just Band-Aids attempting to 
cover up flawed provisions. 
For example, one amendment at-
tempts to paper over the flaws in title 
I by expanding the requirement for the 
President to provide his or her ration-
ale to Congress detailing why an IG 
was removed. 
Yes, understanding the President’s 
rationale for removing an IG is very 
important to Congress. This amend-
ment, however, fails to address the fun-
damental issue in the section, specifi-
cally limiting the reasons for an IG’s 
removal or transferred to only nine 
constraining reasons. 
Another provision in this package 
seeks to amend title II, but title II al-
ready passed earlier this Congress as a 
standalone bill by voice vote under sus-
pension. This amendment to title II 
would undermine that broadly sup-
ported bill by creating an easy-to- 
abuse loophole for a President to re-
move an IG immediately, rather than 
waiting the 30 days for Congress to re-
view the required notice of removal. 
My Democrat colleagues have stated 
constantly that the goal of their legis-
lation is to ensure that it is incredibly 
difficult to remove an IG, yet they sup-
port an amendment that would gut this 
and allow our President to circumvent 
the will of Congress. This is what hap-
pens when the majority decides to go it 
alone rather than seeking to work to-
gether to craft strong bipartisan legis-
lation. 
This bloc of amendments is the per-
fect analog for this legislation—many 
good provisions mixed with a few poi-
son bills, which undermine the intent 
of the legislation as a whole. Therefore, 
I must ask my colleagues to vote 
against this package of amendments. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
CARTER), one of the newest members of 
our caucus. He serves on the Commit-
tees of Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture and Small Business. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for 
her incredible leadership on this very 
critical and important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today because 
I support this bill and the common-
sense amendment that I have for it. I 
thank the chairwoman for her incred-
ible hard work on this important issue. 
Inspectors general play a key role in 
our government. They provide trans-
parency and accountability into gov-
ernment programs and spending. They 
help prevent waste and fix mismanage-
ment and abuse. 
The IG Independence and Empower-
ment Act would ensure that they have 
the autonomy and the authority to do 
their 
jobs 
without 
political 
inter-
ference. My amendment is simple and 
in line with the goals of the bill. It 
would ensure that the inspector gen-
eral is paid commensurate to their 
task. 
Currently, IGs make less money than 
some of their senior advisers. I think 
the person with the most responsibility 
should be paid accordingly. If we want 
the best people to work these impor-
tant jobs, we need to make sure that 
their pay matches their role. My 
amendment would fix an unintended 
consequence 
of 
current 
law 
and 
strengthen IG offices so that they can 
better carry out their essential work. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I support all of 
the en bloc amendments, including Mr. 
CARTER’s, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-
vious

AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. COMER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 4 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
74. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 4, strike line 1 and all that follows 
through page 6, line 16.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment strips out the three provi-
sions of this legislation that do not 
have bipartisan support in order for the 
IG Independence and Empowerment 
Act to move forward with the full sup-
port of the U.S. House. Both sides of 
the aisle can then come back to the 
table to fix the remaining provisions in 
a manner that addresses concerns on 
both sides of the aisle. 
Specifically, my amendment strikes 
title I, which would artificially con-
strain the President from removing or 
reassigning an IG to one of nine spe-
cific reasons listed in the provision. 
As drafted, title I would have the ef-
fect of prohibiting a President from re-
moving an IG who is acting in bad faith 
and undermining a duly elected Presi-
dent’s policies in a purely partisan 
manner. 
My amendment also strikes title III, 
which strictly limits who the President 
could name as the acting inspector 
general to the ‘‘first assistant.’’ This 
provision does not include any com-
monsense exceptions, creating unin-
tended consequences. 
For example, it could elevate an indi-
vidual to acting IG who may be en-
gaged in the same misconduct which 
caused the original IG to have been re-
moved. 
Lastly, my amendment strikes title 
V of the bill, which grants inspectors 
general the authority to issue sub-
poenas to compel the testimony of 
former Federal officials, including po-
litical appointees. 
While I support granting IGs testi-
monial subpoena authority, the cur-
rent provision lacks necessary safe-
guards and could result in it being used 
in a politically abusive manner. 
Madam Speaker, I support the goals 
behind these provisions, as well as the 
other seven titles of the bill, which 
have strong bipartisan support. How-
ever, my amendment addresses the 
problematic language in these three 
sections. That is why I ask my Repub-
lican and Democrat colleagues to pass 
this amendment to enable us to nego-
tiate a bipartisan solution for the in-
spector general community that can be 
signed into law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to this amendment 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, this amend-
ment would absolutely gut the bill. 
The amendment would strike the bill’s 
key protection for inspectors general 
against political retaliation by elimi-
nating the protection that would only 
allow an IG to be removed only for a le-
gitimate cause. Not for political retal-
iation, not because a President doesn’t 
like what they are doing or an inves-
tigation that they have started, but 
only for mismanagement or illegal acts 
for cause. 
We saw last year how unlimited au-
thority can be abused when President 
Trump bullied and retaliated against 
two IGs who were investigating his ad-
ministration, including when he fired 
the State Department IG. These pro-
tections are constitutional. 
Last month, the Independent Con-
gressional Review Service released an 
analysis of congressional authority to 
limit the removal of IGs and concluded 
that for-cause removal restrictions 
‘‘appear to be a constitutionally per-
missible means of encouraging inde-
pendence for most IGs.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
would also gut the protection in the 
bill against the appointment of acting 
IGs with a clear conflict of interest. 
The amendment would strike a require-
ment that acting IGs come from an Of-
fice of Inspector General. The Council 
of Inspectors General for Integrity and 
Efficiency requested this reform, pro-
posed by Republican Representative 
PORTER, as one of its top legislative 
priorities in order to ‘‘enhance the 
independence of OIGs.’’ 
We saw serious abuses during the last 
administration. In both the Depart-
ment of Transportation and the De-
partment of State, President Trump 
named political appointees within the 
agency to serve as the acting IG over-
seeing the same agency. 
Finally, this amendment would strip 
from the bill an important reform that 
would allow IGs to issue a subpoena to 
require individuals outside of the Fed-
eral Government to provide testimony, 
if needed, for an investigation. This has 
long been a priority for inspectors gen-
eral to allow thorough and complete 
investigations. 
Madam Speaker, multiple IGs have 
reported that Trump administration 
officials, including Jeff Sessions, have 
refused to cooperate with investiga-
tions. No Federal employee should be 
able to simply avoid and escape ac-
countability by leaving government 
and saying, ‘‘I just no longer will tes-
tify or participate in finding the 
truth.’’ 
These provisions were passed by the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
and the House in 2018, in a Republican- 
led bill, and contained carefully crafted 
compromises struck by Chairman ISSA 
and Ranking Member Cummings years 
ago. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation pro-
vides procedural safeguards to ensure 
that subpoena authority is not abused 
and it does not interfere with ongoing 
investigations. For example, the bill 
will require an inspector general to ob-
tain the approval of a panel of three 
other inspectors general in order to 
issue a subpoena for testimony. 
A few IGs, including the Department 
of Defense IG, already have this au-
thority. The language I authored and 
that the Congress passed on a bipar-
tisan basis, the Pandemic Response Ac-
countability Committee was provided 
testimonial subpoena authority when 
it was created as part of the CARES 
Act last Congress. 
There are many instances of former 
officials and nongovernment employees 
avoiding IG interviews going back over 
a decade. For example, IGs were unable 
to interview retired agents in the 
‘‘Fast and Furious’’ investigation, and 
nongovernment witnesses to the Car-
ter-Page FISA warrant investigation. 
This has never been a partisan issue 
before. In fact, the underlying bill had 
many, many bipartisan pieces. So in a 
letter to the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, Department of Justice In-
spector General has also come out 
against this. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 504, the pre-

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEMBRANCE OF VIC-
TIMS OF THE CHAMPLAIN TOWERS COLLAPSE 
IN SURFSIDE, FLORIDA 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today with a 
grieving but hopeful heart in the wake 
of an unimaginable tragedy in Surfside, 
Florida. 
As we gather, our world-renowned 
Miami Dade search and rescue teams 
are joined by teams from as far away 
as Israel and Mexico to search for po-
tential survivors of Champlain Towers 
South in Surfside. 
Since that unprecedented collapse, 
first responders, medical personnel, en-
gineers, grief counselors, and case-
workers have painstakingly worked 
nonstop to assist in the search and res-
cue, providing support to the families 
and to begin an investigation. 
For those still trapped, we hold out 
hope for the search to discover sur-
vivors. For all those who lost loved 
ones, we send our deepest condolences 
and pledge support and solidarity. 
So many in our community fled na-
tions where they faced danger. That 
makes this tragedy all the more pain-
ful. But we are resilient. We will be 
there every step of the way for the 
families of those missing in the rubble. 
But we know we cannot do this alone. 
I thank the Biden administration for 
the speedy delivery of Federal re-
sources, and Mayors Daniella Levine 
Cava and Charles Burkett for their 
steadfast leadership in this truly un-
precedented crisis. 
And our deepest thanks for the re-
markable, relentless first responders 
who are still on that pile, searching 
around the clock in the hope of finding 
even one survivor. 
Madam Speaker, the agony that 
these families are going through is be-
yond comprehension. So on behalf of 
the missing, those who perished, and 
their families, I ask that the House 
please rise and pause for a moment of 
silence in memory and in honor of 
those 
who 
have 
been 
struggling 
through this Surfside tragedy and cri-
sis. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair would ask 
all Members to rise for a moment of si-
lence in remembrance of the victims of 
the collapse of the Champlain Towers 
building in Surfside, Florida.

MOMENT 
OF 
SILENCE 
RECOG-
NIZING THE PASSING OF EARL 
MICHAEL WILLIS 
(Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, 28 years ago, Earl Michael 
Willis was born in Brusly, Louisiana. 
When he was 14 years old, his sister, 
Rachael, died of cancer. He went on to 
go to Catholic High, my high school, 
and went on to LSU. 
In 2018, he got engaged to his wife, 
Megan. He and Megan got married just 
last year. 
In order to honor his sister Rachael’s 
death, he said he was going to run a 
100-mile ultramarathon, and he did so 
earlier this year in Key West, Florida. 
Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, that 
effort to honor his sister Rachael’s life 
resulted in his death. The day after the 
ultramarathon, Michael Willis, at the 
young age of 27, passed away. 
Madam Speaker, I want to honor his 
life. Our best wishes and thoughts and 
prayers to his mother, Cristal; his fa-
ther, Earl; his brother, Nicholas; and 
his wife, Megan. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that we have a 
moment of silence to honor his life. 
f 
IMPROVING TRANSPORTATION IN 
RHODE ISLAND 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in strong support of 
the INVEST Act, which contains near-
ly $19 million in funding for three in-
frastructure projects in Rhode Island’s 
Second District. 
This legislation will improve roads in 
Westerly and Charlestown to increase 
accessibility along the Scenic High-
way, repair roads in Cranston to 
smooth the commute for Rhode Island-
ers traveling across the State, and con-
nect a key stretch of the East Coast 
Greenway in Coventry to boost tour-
ism, create jobs, and spur economic de-
velopment. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Rhode 
Island’s 
roads and bridges desperately need re-
pair. According to the White House, 148 
bridges and over 860 miles of highway 
are in poor condition in Rhode Island, 
earning our State the grade of C-minus 
on our infrastructure report card. 
Investing in our aging infrastructure 
will create good-paying jobs and make 
our roads safer and less congested. 
That is true of Rhode Island and every 
State across the country. 
Supporting the INVEST Act and the 
important projects within it is a no- 
brainer. 
As my New England Patriots always 
say: Do your job. 
To my colleagues, let’s do our job so 
Americans can get on with theirs. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TIONS ACT 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
stand in solidarity with the majority of 
Americans that oppose taxpayer fund-
ing of abortions. 
Despite how clear Americans are on 
the issue, President Biden and the 
Democrats in Congress are attempting 
to force Americans to pay for abor-
tions. 
President Biden’s recent budget calls 
for removal of the Hyde amendment, 
the appropriations rider that prohibits 
Federal funding of abortion. Congres-
sional Democrats have committed to 
removing the Hyde amendment and 
other longstanding pro-life provisions 
from this year’s appropriations bill. 
We must not allow longstanding 
abortion funding prohibitions that are 
widely supported by the American peo-
ple to be gotten rid of at the whims of 
pro-abortion radicals. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NEW JERSEY’S 
OLYMPIC TRACK ATHLETES 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize some 
of the amazing track talent from the 
12th District. 
This past weekend, Athing Mu of 
Trenton, the child of Sudanese immi-
grants, dominated her 800-meter Olym-
pic qualifying race, nearly breaking 
the American record despite an early 
collision on the track. This young 
woman is finally getting the recogni-
tion she has worked so hard for. 
No less impressive was Dunellen’s 
own Sydney McLaughlin, who broke 
the world record for the 400-meter hur-
dles, becoming the first woman to ever 
run the race in under 52 seconds. 
We have known about these extraor-
dinary young women for quite some 
time back home, but now America has 
had the opportunity to see them in ac-
tion. 
New Jersey is so proud of them. I 
can’t wait for them to show the world 
what they will do at the Olympics. 
f 
CONDEMNING CCP FOR 100 YEARS 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to condemn the Chinese Communist 
Party for 100 years of human rights 
violations. 
The CCP centennial is not a cause for 
celebration but a time to reflect on the 
millions of people who have been re-
pressed, tortured, and killed at the 
hands of the Communist regime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3292 
June 29, 2021 
From the suppression of a free press 
in Hong Kong to the mass internment 
and torture of the Uighurs, the record 
of human rights abuses carried out by 
CCP is as horrific as it is long. 
We must hold the Chinese Com-
munist Party accountable. As a mem-
ber 
of 
the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China, I am committed 
to working with my colleagues to hold 
China responsible for their abuse. 
Madam Speaker, I stand with those 
fighting for freedom and democracy. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER 
THOMAS SAWYER 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Officer Thomas Sawyer 
of the Hammond Police Department, 
who heartbreakingly passed away ear-
lier this month after a 5-week battle 
with COVID–19. 
Officer Sawyer’s life’s work was one 
of public service. After serving as a 
member of the United States Air Force 
during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
he went on to serve another 23 years 
with the Hammond Police Department. 
The first responders of northwest In-
diana and across our Nation run toward 
danger at a moment’s notice in our 
times of greatest need, and our commu-
nities will forever be grateful for the 
selfless service of Officer Sawyer. 
As Officer Sawyer contracted this 
disease in the line of duty, let us con-
tinue to recognize its ever-present dan-
ger and how we must take action to 
keep ourselves and our neighbors safe. 
My thoughts and prayers continue to 
be with his wife, Mary, and all of his 
family and friends during this difficult 
time.

REPEAL UNJUST SALT CAP AND 
RESTORE FULL DEDUCTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SUOZZI) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, to-
night, over the next hour, I, along with 
my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle, will rise to advocate for the re-
peal of the unjust and unfair SALT cap 
and the full restoration of the SALT 
deduction. There are five basic argu-
ments that I, along with my col-
leagues, will flesh out over the next 
hour. 
One, the SALT cap was specifically 
and unjustly targeted against the resi-
dents of New York, New Jersey, Cali-
fornia, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachu-
setts, Maryland, Minnesota, Michigan, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Rhode 
Island, Hawaii, and other congressional 
districts with high local and State 
taxes. 
Two, middle-class families, which in 
these States can earn between $100,000 
and $200,000 per year, are disproportion-
ately impacted in a negative way. 
Three, these same middle-class fami-
lies, as well as wealthy families, are 
incentivized by the loss of the SALT 
deduction to leave States with high 
State and local taxes, thereby leaving 
a gaping hole in the revenues that are 
used by these same States to fund their 
programs. When wealthy individuals 
and families leave our States because 
they have been incentivized to leave 
because of the loss of the SALT deduc-
tion, it is middle-class and low-income 
people who are left behind to hold the 
bag. Because of the gap in revenues, 
they will either face higher taxes, 
which 
is 
unacceptable 
and 
unsustainable, 
or 
reduced 
services, 
which is unlikely. 
Four, the SALT cap is anti-union be-
cause one of the main reasons that 
taxes are higher in SALT States is be-
cause we pay our teachers and our pub-
lic safety and our civil servants signifi-
cantly higher wages than our low-tax 
competitor States. 
Five, many States with high State 
and local taxes that have been nega-
tively affected by the SALT cap are net 
donors to the Federal Government. 
That is, these States contribute more 
to the Federal Government in income 
taxes than they receive in Federal pro-
grams and contracts. They are donor 
States. 
Why are the taxes higher in New 
York, California, and other SALT 
States? Why are the taxes lower in 
Florida, 
Texas, 
and 
other 
low-tax 
States? 
The reason for our higher taxes is be-
cause we insure our children. New York 
State and California have some of the 
lowest rates of uninsured children in 
the Nation, while Texas and Florida 
have some of the highest rates of unin-
sured children in our country. We 
adopted the Affordable Care Act; they 
refused to. 
Our States have the highest rates of 
union employees. Our low-tax competi-
tors don’t like unions. In fact, they ac-
tively oppose them. They have right- 
to-work laws. They don’t pay their 
teachers well. 
In States like New York, we have one 
of the greatest mass transit systems in 
the world that delivers the lowest car-
bon footprint per capita of any city in 
the world. In California, they have 
been implementing policies to address 
climate change for decades. Yet, in 
low-tax States, they have no mass 
transit to speak of, and they are still 
debating whether climate change is a 
hoax. 
Secretary Yellen has said that we 
need to stop the international race to 
the bottom by creating a global min-
imum corporate tax. Well, we need to 
discourage a race to the bottom right 
here in the United States of America. 
It is cheaper not to insure your chil-
dren. It is cheaper to use nonunion 
labor. It is cheaper to have lax environ-
mental regulations, unregulated utili-
ties that shut down in cold weather, or 
septic tanks instead of sewers that 
cause red tide in your waterways. 
Each State, each city, each labora-
tory of democracy has decided how 
they want to govern, what services 
they want to provide, and how much in 
taxes they will collect. By removing 
the SALT deduction, the first deduc-
tion in the Federal income tax code, a 
deduction that has been in place for 
over 100 years, by capping this deduc-
tion, we are crippling the very States, 
cities, and local municipalities that 
are the economic engines of our Na-
tion. 
By capping the SALT deduction, the 
long arm of the Federal Government is 
reaching into our States and local gov-
ernments to try to determine what pro-
grams they should provide, how much 
they should collect in taxes. They are 
breaching the covenant of federalism 
that has been in place for over 100 
years. 
That is why, tomorrow, will be hold-
ing a press conference with the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors, the National 
League of Cities, and the National As-
sociation of Counties to showcase how 
the SALT cap is devastating our local 
governments. 
Last week, we held a press conference 
with unions to show how they are nega-
tively impacted by the SALT cap. 
That is why, tonight, so many of my 
colleagues are here to join me in our 
call to repeal the unfair and the unjust 
SALT cap.

Now, I yield to my friend from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM), who has taken a 
leadership role from the other side of 
the aisle to talk to us about SALT.

June 29, 2021 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, Represent-
ative SUOZZI from New York, for yield-
ing. And I want to thank him for work-
ing with me in a bipartisan push to re-
peal the cap on SALT deductions that 
is hurting American workers and fami-
lies. 
Californians in the 39th District— 
which I represent—and across our 
State, have been burdened enough by 
high State and local taxes in addition 
to high cost of living and housing. The 
last thing they need is to be hurt even 
more because of these State and local 
taxes at the Federal level. 
I have heard from many of my con-
stituents about the burdensome taxes 
they have to pay as a result of the 
SALT cap. These are workers, business 
owners, and families who are strug-
gling to survive due to the COVID–19 
pandemic. It is estimated that in the 
2022 tax year, California’s 39th District 
will pay on average $600 million more 
in taxes. 
In 2018 alone, Californians paid an ad-
ditional $11.2 billion in Federal taxes 
because of the SALT cap. That trans-
lated into 55,000 fewer jobs and a loss of 
$3.4 billion in wages. 
Assuming a middle-of-the-road rate 
of 25 percent, an average taxpayer who 
claimed 
itemized 
deductions 
would 
have saved $6,521 in taxes if the SALT 
deduction were not capped at $10,000. 
These high tax rates are on top of the 
skyrocketing housing prices across the 
State. In fact, according to the Na-
tional Association of Realtors, the me-
dian price for a single-family home in 
California has increased by more than 
39 percent in the past year alone, sur-
passing the $800,000 threshold for the 
first time in April of this year. 
That is why it is a top priority of 
mine in Congress to make life more af-
fordable for Californians and repeal the 
SALT cap. This is hurting my constitu-
ents and many middle-class Americans 
across the Nation. 
I was proud to join my friend, Rep-
resentative SUOZZI, as an original co-
sponsor of the SALT Deductibility Act. 
This bill would simply repeal the cap 
on SALT deductions and send a mes-
sage: No more to burdensome taxes, 
and yes to our families keeping more 
money in their hands. 
I am also proud to serve as co-chair 
of the bipartisan SALT Caucus as we 
continue to work together to repeal 
this cap and help lower taxes for my 
constituents and businesses. 
I will continue to do all I can to de-
liver results for California’s 39th Dis-
trict. I thank Representative SUOZZI 
for organizing this Special Order and 
for his leadership to repeal the SALT 
cap. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Congresswoman KIM so much 
and thank her for being here this 
evening. 
You have been hearing about the 
SALT cap and the effect on your con-
stituents. Have they been talking to 
you about this a great deal? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM) 
for the purpose of a colloquy. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, on a regular basis we have 
had townhalls and we have had regular 
meetings 
throughout 
my 
business 
roundtable 
discussions, 
and 
they 
brought this issue up over and over. 
Mr. SUOZZI. And are people talking 
about leaving the region because of the 
effect of the taxes? I yield to the gen-
tlewoman. 
Mrs. KIM of California. In the last 
several years we have had many thou-
sands of Californians leaving to other 
States like Texas, and I have to lit-
erally go over there to meet my friends 
and listen to these problems. So, yes, 
this is a major issue, and I will con-
tinue to work with the gentleman to 
repeal the SALT cap. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Congresswoman KIM
for her 
comments. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL), who has been a real leader on 
the issue of SALT, and who has been 
outspoken ever since 2017 on this issue. 
We are grateful to him. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. SUOZZI for yielding. 
When talking about the SALT deduc-
tion, we are not griping about some-
thing that came about yesterday. The 
SALT deduction goes back to the Civil 
War. We are talking about 150 years of 
history when President Lincoln had to 
fund a brand-new army to crush the 
traitor States in the South. So we 
must use the 150-year history as a base-
line for our tax policy when discussing 
reform. 
It is not low-hanging fruit as it was 
in 2017 when they looked for the money 
for the false tax cuts and they got 
slammed out of office in 2018. Go to the 
facts. 
Abe knew what he was doing, how it 
took money away from the States. 
They couldn’t build hospitals. They 
couldn’t build schools. They couldn’t 
build roads. He knew what he was 
doing. The States needed money, too. 
Republicans targeted blue States. 
They bragged about it. I couldn’t be-
lieve it. I couldn’t believe my ears 
when I heard them on the floor of the 
House openly admitting it. They made 
no qualms about it. They targeted 
these blue States when passing their 
2017 tax scam. Talk about a hoax. They 
bragged about it. 
Its motivations alone are disquali-
fying, but its impacts are worse. SALT 
was a lifeline to the middle class. De-
spite half-truths and outright false-
hoods, SALT is about the middle class, 
and if you can’t stand up for the middle 
class, you shouldn’t be here. 
In 2017, 42 percent of the Jersey tax-
payers, nearly 2 million people, de-
ducted their State and local taxes, 
averaging over $19,000 per household. 
That is a $9,000 increase in taxes. Those 
phonies did it. That is why they got 
smashed in 2018. 
More than 81 percent of those who de-
ducted SALT earned less than $200,000. 
Naysayers claim this deduction only 
benefits the well-off. They do not rec-
ognize the cost of living in our States. 
The same people who voted for the tax 
cuts that helped the 1 percent, the 1.5 
percent, they felt badly about the rich 
people who—one clown who went to jail 
in New York State, before he went, he 
said that we had to take care of our do-
nors. He said it. I didn’t. I mean, he 
didn’t go to jail for saying that. He 
played the stocks. 
Middle income in New Jersey is not 
the same as Oklahoma or South Da-
kota. Housing, food, childcare, and 
transportation costs are much lower 
there. Our middle-class taxpayers are 
the pack mules of the U.S. tax system, 
and as one of our brothers from New 
Jersey would say, we are tired of being 
the lackeys for these other States. 
Look who is paying Federal taxes. 
Our middle-class taxpayers will no 
longer sit idly by. This cap dumped 
even more weight on the backs of my 
constituents in my district, the Ninth 
District of New Jersey. I appreciate the 
growing recognition that relief is need-
ed. 
Senator SANDERS’ budget draft is an 
important step in the right direction. 
But we have got to think big. We de-
mand relief now for our States and our 
middle-class constituents. They are the 
backbone of the Biden administration’s 
coalition. Just last week, we stood 
shoulder to shoulder with working- 
class firefighters, police officers, and 
teachers who support our SALT de-
mands. Our urgency is absolute. 
We won’t allow our neighbors’ pay to 
be taken for granted. I will close with 
just four words: No SALT, no deals. 
And I will close by saying that Abra-
ham Lincoln, one of the greatest Presi-
dents in the history of the country, a 
true patriot, he stood behind the mid-
dle class. He knew what the States 
went through. 
This is the oldest deduction on the 
books, and they have criminalized it. 
And if anything I reported here is not 
right, I hope they stand up and say 
that it is not right. I have got the 
other facts here. What other facts are 
you talking about? 
Mr. SUOZZI. Well, I thank Mr. PAS-
CRELL very much for his comments. I 
wanted to mention that the gentleman 
served as the mayor of his hometown. I 
yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, I did. 
Mr. SUOZZI. And you talk about 
President Lincoln when the Federal 
Tax Code was first adopted, and the 
idea was that we didn’t want the Fed-
eral Government stopping local gov-
ernments and State governments from 
being the laboratories of democracy. 
Mr. PASCRELL. That is right. It is a 
fact of life, yes. 
Mr. SUOZZI. And so they put a de-
duction in place for State and local 
taxes so that State and local govern-
ments could govern the way they wish. 
Mr. PASCRELL. And they could 
build the hospitals and the schools and

the roads. Where were they going to 
get the money if the Federal Govern-
ment took all of the money to fight the 
war? 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I know 
that the gentleman has always been a 
strong proponent for law enforcement, 
for the firefighters, and public safety 
officials, and they are very dramati-
cally negatively affected by this. Is 
that right? 
Mr. PASCRELL. Yes. And many of 
the first responders came out and sup-
ported this bill last week. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Mr. PASCRELL very much for his 
comments. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. ESHOO), a good friend 
and a leader, not just on this issue but 
in Congress. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding to me and 
certainly for his wonderful leadership 
on this issue. 
Anyone that is tuned in this evening 
from across the country is hearing a 
lot of passion spilling over at the podi-
ums here, and for very good reason. In 
2017, despite the opposition of every 
single Democrat in the United States 
House of Representatives and some Re-
publicans, Congress passed a tax law 
that bulldozed the State and local tax 
deductibility. This hurts a lot of peo-
ple. 
Now, that was close to a $5 trillion 
package and so why was this bulldozed? 
They went through the Tax Code look-
ing for things that were deductible to 
lower the price tag of a highly inequi-
table tax package. And the SALT de-
duction, as it is known, was then 
capped at $10,000 for both individuals 
and then for married couples filing 
jointly. 
I viewed this then, as I do today, as 
an assault on the middle class of our 
country. It was one of the main reasons 
that I voted against the 2017 tax law. 
Now I think that if you ask the ques-
tion of 435 Members of the House: Do 
you support the middle class? They 
would all say ‘‘yes.’’ But the RECORD 
shows something else. 
We know that everyone aspires to get 
into the middle class, and we know 
that the middle class, as my father al-
ways used to say, is made up of ex-
traordinary, ordinary people who are 
the backbone of this country. And that 
is why this policy is so wrong and it is 
so hurtful. 
This is a very important deduction 
for the middle class. Middle class, you 
file long term, and you have four areas 
that you can deduct: mortgage interest 
deduction, 
charitable 
contributions, 
healthcare expenses, and State and 
local taxes. And they wiped that out. 
Now, you tell me whether that is fair 
or not. I don’t think so. And I don’t 
think people across the country do ei-
ther. Capping the SALT deduction af-
fects nearly 200,000 families in my con-
gressional district. 
I am not talking about the whole 
State of California. I am talking about 
California’s 18th Congressional Dis-
trict, and it has raised taxes on over a 
million households in the State of Cali-
fornia. Prior to this harmful cap, my 
constituents—hold on to your seats, 
hold on to your hats—deducted an av-
erage of $63,083 in State and local 
taxes. Wiped it out. 
Some have unfairly, I think, ma-
ligned the SALT deduction as a benefit 
for the wealthy. I think it is an essen-
tial deduction for taxpayers in high- 
cost, high-tax States like California. 
And that has been spoken to earlier. 
That is a very important legitimate 
case to be made. In the bay area, the 
beautiful bay area of California, north-
ern California, the cost of living is 
really very expensive, and it keeps 
going up. 
b 2000 
And it is so high that the Economic 
Policy Institute estimates that a fam-
ily of four needs to earn more than 
$100,000 to earn a modest but adequate 
standard of living. That is simply a 
fact. 
So prior to the law, more than 3 mil-
lion households in California with an 
income of less than that annually 
claimed this deduction, as did nearly 
one-third of taxpayers nationwide. 
This evening, I think each one of us 
can outline why this is wrong; why the 
deductibility needs to be restored. Con-
gress needs to reform our tax code. And 
when we do, so should the restoration 
of this deductibility be restored. 
Why? 
Because, again, the middle class is 
the backbone of America. We should 
not be assaulting them. We should be 
assisting them. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for leading this effort this 
evening. It is a worthy one. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship on this and for being such a fierce 
advocate for the middle class. 
I now introduce a good friend of mine 
from California, who really had a dis-
trict that was devastated by COVID. 
People lost their jobs at one of the 
greatest entertainment facilities in the 
country, and now he wants to tell us 
about how SALT is affecting his dis-
trict. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CARBAJAL). 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The 
gentleman 
is 
right, 
Madam 
Speaker, COVID really devastated my 
community, but, more importantly, 
SALT also landed a devastating punch. 
This issue is about proud Califor-
nians who pay more than their fair 
share of Federal taxes. It is about eq-
uity for fellow Americans, like Califor-
nians, and other States like California. 
California today is still the largest 
State in the United States in terms of 
population and economic activity. For 
years and years, California has been a 
net donor State to the United States. 
Let me repeat. For years and years, 
California has paid more Federal dol-
lars than it gets back from the Federal 
Government. 
We Californians work hard. We live 
in a State that generates tremendous 
economic activity, and we have a very 
high cost of living. And we pay more— 
we pay more than our fair share of 
taxes proudly. As Americans, we pay 
our Federal taxes proudly. 
So I ask why? Why is the Federal 
Government not being fair to States 
like California? 
So why do we randomly have a law 
that arbitrarily caps our State and 
local tax deductibility on our Federal 
taxes? 
This SALT cap hurts. It hurts my 
friends and neighbors. It hurts middle- 
class families in California. In my 
State, the average price of a home, a 
used house, middle class, is now close 
to $800,000. 
So why would we make it more dif-
ficult, more expensive for a middle- 
class family to buy a home? 
I say to all of you, both sides of the 
aisle, let’s be fair and let’s be equitable 
to the middle class in this country. 
Join me in thanking States like Cali-
fornia for paying more than their fair 
share of Federal taxes. Join me by 
eliminating the SALT cap, that is de-
ductibility of local taxes on the Fed-
eral return. 
And I say to you: No SALT deduct-
ible, no deal. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to—some people, when they hear 
you talk about this, and they hear a 
home worth $500,000, $600,000, $700,000, 
$800,000, they think, boy, that person 
must be really rich. 
What they don’t seem to understand 
is that in my State, in your State, and 
many of the States represented here, 
those are actually middle-class home 
values. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. That is a starter 
home. 
Mr. SUOZZI. So we have to recognize 
that the country is not the same all 
over. If you make $150,000 in your 
household, you are in the top 20 per-
cent of the income earners of the coun-
try. 
However, if you make $150,000 in your 
district or my district, you are not a 
rich person. If you make $150,000 in 
Oklahoma or in Iowa or North Dakota, 
you may be a wealthy person. So we 
have to recognize these regional dif-
ferences. 
People say: Well, why should we be 
subsidizing what you are doing? 
And the gentleman points out so 
clearly in what he just spoke about 
that we are, in fact, in our States, sub-
sidizing the rest of the country. We are 
net donors and they are net takers. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. We pay more than 
our fair share of Federal taxes year 
after year. 
Mr. SUOZZI. I thank the gentleman 
for being such a fierce advocate. 
Madam Speaker, I want to travel 
across the country from California now

June 29, 2021 
to New Jersey, to another fierce advo-
cate; someone who served in the U.S. 
military as a Navy helicopter pilot for 
5 years both in the Middle East and in 
Europe; someone who has been one of 
the fiercest advocates for the reinstate-
ment of the SALT deduction. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to be rising today alongside 
so many of my colleagues to declare 
loudly that the time has come to fi-
nally address the State and local tax 
deduction cap for families that have 
been slapped with this double tax for 4 
long years. 
In States like New Jersey, we pride 
ourselves on making the investments 
necessary to sustain our top-tier public 
schools, invest in infrastructure and 
open spaces, and support a prevailing 
wage for our unions. That is why peo-
ple move to my State. That is why 
families stay for generations. 
But when the SALT deduction cap 
imposed by the 2017 Trump tax bill in-
stituted, our ability to keep making 
those key investments was threatened. 
The SALT deduction cap affects resi-
dents in every corner of my district. It 
impacts families made up of teachers, 
first responders, and public servants. 
For my constituents and millions of 
taxpayers throughout the country, the 
bottom line is you don’t have to be a 
millionaire to be impacted by SALT. 
The simple fact is that it has imposed 
a harmful double tax and has created 
one of the largest marriage penalties in 
the Federal tax code. 
With the SALT cap in place, States 
and localities face increased pressure 
to cut back on important investments 
in priorities like education, prevailing 
wages, infrastructure, environmental 
protections, and services for seniors. 
Those investments became harder to 
make when the Federal Government 
decided to tax New Jersey families 
twice. This means that more New 
Jerseyans’ money is going to the Fed-
eral Government, instead of being in-
vested in our local communities. 
The result will be less spending over 
time on these priorities, which would 
be a detriment to ensuring our econ-
omy works for everyone. 
I have been fighting since my first 
day in office to repeal the SALT deduc-
tion cap. I have helped secure passage 
of a repeal twice in this very Chamber. 
And I feel confident that so many of 
my colleagues understand this issue 
and why it is critical that we repeal it; 
largely because of the work and advo-
cacy of the Members who are speaking 
here tonight. 
But we need to keep up this fight for 
our constituents. As we head into 
crunch time on infrastructure negotia-
tions in Congress, now is the time to 
deliver relief for families across New 
Jersey and States around the country 
that are disproportionately impacted 
by this harmful double tax. 
Last week, I launched an initiative 
back in New Jersey, declaring it the 
Summer of SALT, to make it clear 
that we will do everything in our power 
to make it happen. There simply isn’t 
another option for New Jersey families. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congresswoman, you 
have been an amazing advocate. You 
mentioned in your remarks at the end 
there about this being a double tax. 
Can you tell us a little bit about that? 
Ms. SHERRILL. Sure. So as you 
know, the people in my district pay 
State and local taxes, and that is what 
funds our great public school system. 
New Jersey has the best public school 
system for 2 years running in the Na-
tion; types of things like that, services 
that our New Jersey families care so 
much about. And now the Federal Gov-
ernment is taxing that money. So you 
are getting taxed twice in New Jersey, 
to really put downward pressure on our 
ability to fund those great public serv-
ices. 
Mr. SUOZZI. So you are getting 
taxed on the taxes you have already 
paid. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Exactly. 
Mr. SUOZZI. So if a family makes 
$100,000 in your State, and they have to 
pay $20,000 in taxes, between their 
property taxes and their income taxes, 
that leaves them with $80,000 of that 
income. 
However, if they are in a low tax 
State where they don’t have as good 
services, they start with $100,000, but 
they only pay $5,000 in State and local 
taxes, they have got $95,000 left in in-
come. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Yep. Exactly. 
Mr. SUOZZI. But they are being 
taxed the same at the Federal level. 
Ms. SHERRILL. And now not able to 
deduct that. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, now I 
want to go across the aisle again to 
Congresswoman MICHELLE STEEL from 
California, who is also being accosted 
by her constituents. They are talking 
to her about the fact that they need 
the SALT deduction back. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Mrs. 
STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman SUOZZI for leading 
this important tax matter. It is very 
important to our constituents. 
Taxpayers in California’s 48th Con-
gressional District, which I am proud 
to represent, were responsible for 19.8 
percent of all SALT deductions in 2018. 
The average SALT deduction lost in 
my district was $28,532. In a place like 
Orange County, where we already pay 
some of the highest taxes in the coun-
try, this cap takes more money from 
hardworking families. 
There were great improvements made 
in the 2017 tax reform law, like simpli-
fying the tax code and making the cor-
porate tax rate more on par with other 
nations. But it also chose winners and 
losers; and, unfortunately, those in 
high-cost-of-living States, like in New 
York and California, are paying the 
price. 
This is a bipartisan issue because we 
know how much this affects hard-
working families in these high-cost 
States. I do think we can make 
progress on this, but not at the cost of 
raising taxes on Americans and Amer-
ican businesses, especially at a time 
when we are working to rebuild our 
local economies and get businesses 
back open. 
This is a bipartisan issue. We can’t 
muddy the water by adding it to par-
tisan legislation that will pass on 
party line only. I don’t want to see ad-
ditional tax gimmicks come before 
Congress. I want the deduction back on 
the table. 
I am proud to support two pieces of 
legislation that would fully repeal the 
SALT cap. One bill by my fellow Cali-
fornian, MIKE GARCIA; and the other 
one by New York Congressman THOMAS 
SUOZZI. 
Our constituents should keep more of 
their hard-earned money. It belongs to 
them, not the Federal Government. 
I am proud to join my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to continue call-
ing for a repeal of the SALT cap. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congresswoman, thank 
you so much for being here tonight and 
for speaking out on this very impor-
tant issue. We are grateful for your 
presence here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, at this time I would 
like to go to the middle of the country, 
to the State of Illinois, where my good 
friend who serves on the Ways and 
Means Committee really is one of the 
brightest minds in Congress today, who 
wants to speak to us about the SALT 
deduction and its effect on his district. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. 
SCHNEIDER. 
Congressman 
SUOZZI, I am grateful for you holding 
this Special Order. I am grateful for 
your friendship in Congress and the 
work we do together on many things, 
but, in particular, on our efforts to re-
peal the onerous cap on the SALT de-
duction. 
In 2017, the Trump administration 
raised taxes for middle-class families 
in Illinois and across the country by 
capping the State and Local Tax deduc-
tion at $10,000. 
The decision was both bad policy and 
bad politics. Capping the SALT deduc-
tion raised the tax burden for Illinois 
working families and small business 
owners. 
In the 10th District, my district, 42 
percent of families rely on the SALT 
deduction. Statewide in Illinois, one in 
three taxpayers file using the SALT de-
duction affected by this cap. 
And this deduction is not a tax break 
on the wealthy. Eighty-five percent of 
Illinois filers who take the SALT de-
duction are middle-income individuals 
and families. 
I have heard from constituents, and 
some of them want to move out of Illi-
nois because their taxes are simply too 
expensive. I see everything our commu-
nities have to offer, from our schools, 
our parks, our public places, commu-
nities that make a difference and make 
a great place to raise family; and it

June 29, 2021 
breaks my heart that someone would 
choose not to live in the 10th District 
just because of an unfair decision made 
to increase the tax burden to punish 
States like Illinois. 
The SALT cap also makes it harder 
for our cities to provide essential serv-
ices, like police departments, fire serv-
ices, fire protection services, libraries 
and public health. These services and 
the workers performing them are the 
backbones of our community. The pan-
demic has already strained their budg-
ets, and we do not need to strain them 
any further. 
Finally, it is no accident which 
States are most affected by the SALT 
cap. These are the States most af-
fected: Illinois, New York, New Jersey, 
and California. 
These States have made the decision 
to invest in their communities, to in-
vest in their people. They have in-
vested in their children, their schools, 
their infrastructure. We should not be 
double-taxed just because we have de-
cided that we want to continue to pay 
to make our communities stronger. 
Reinstating the full SALT deduction 
is a decision about fairness and respon-
sibility. A Federal tax on income al-
ready paid to State and local govern-
ments is, quite simply, double tax-
ation. We have the responsibility to 
stand up for our families, our small 
businesses, and our communities. 
b 2015 
We need a tax system that is fair, 
lifts our Nation, and gives our children 
the future that we all want them to 
have. It is critical that we reinstate 
the full SALT deduction and reduce the 
tax burden for middle-class families 
across the country. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congressman, I want to 
thank you so much. You hit on the 
topic of fairness so many times. Many 
of our States and our local govern-
ments have relied on this deduction for 
literally a hundred years, and it was 
suddenly taken away in 2017. It has had 
a dramatic effect. 
Can you briefly touch on fairness one 
more time? 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Absolutely. As you 
know, when the income tax was put in 
place more than 100 years ago, it was a 
decision that communities, that States 
that decided to invest in their people, 
would not be double taxed. 
Yet, in 2017, the decision of the Re-
publicans was to specifically attack 
these States, these blue States like Il-
linois and New York. It is unfair to 
these communities that are investing 
in schools, public services, fire depart-
ments, police departments, making the 
decision to responsibly pay for them, 
and then have their residents told they 
have to pay a second time with the 
Federal tax. 
To add on top of that, these are the 
States, like New York and Illinois, who 
pay more to the Federal Government 
than they get back. So not only are we 
getting double taxed, we have a burden 
of subsidizing the States that are at-
tacking us now. 
So this is absolutely unfair. It is un-
fair to the States. But, more impor-
tantly, it is unfair to the families we 
represent. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Thank you, Congress-
man. It really galls me sometimes 
when I hear people boasting about the 
fact that they are leaving our States 
and moving to other States, when, in 
fact, we are subsidizing the rest of the 
country with our tax dollars. Thank 
you so much for your leadership on 
this issue. We are very grateful. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-
TER), one of the most progressive Mem-
bers of the United States Congress, and 
also one of the great intellects who has 
been so passionate about this issue and 
has some very interesting things to 
share with us. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to champion tax fairness for 
every American across the country, 
across parties, and across the aisle. We 
are here tonight to talk about what 
does it mean to have a fair tax system. 
Since coming to Congress, I have re-
peatedly heard from my constituents 
about how the Trump tax bill doubled 
the taxes they owe due to an arbitrary 
cap on allowable State and local tax 
deductions, often called SALT. 
In the last year before this arbitrary 
$10,000 cap was imposed, nearly two in 
five taxpayers in my district claimed 
the SALT deduction, and their average 
deduction was $22,000 per household. 
They were paying an average of $22,000 
in State and local taxes. 
Capping the SALT deduction created 
double taxation on those families, and 
it penalized millions of middle-class 
families—Republicans, Democrats, and 
Independents alike—based solely on 
the State where they live. 
It is an unfair Federal tax system to 
penalize people based solely on their 
State of residence, yet that is what 
this arbitrary SALT tax cap does. 
Given the rising cost of housing, pre-
scription drugs, college, and childcare, 
every dollar counts for American fami-
lies and families in Orange County. 
This is especially true after a year of 
financial hardship during which mil-
lions of families across the country are 
struggling to stay afloat. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues across the country and across 
the aisle to restore the State and local 
tax deduction to create a fairer tax 
system for every American. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congresswoman, I ask 
you, please go into it a little bit fur-
ther about this concept of double tax-
ation. We have heard it several times 
here tonight. Just explain what you 
mean by double taxation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the Con-
gresswoman for a colloquy. 
Ms. PORTER. The basic principle of 
an income tax is that you are taxed on 
the money that you have available to 
purchase things, to purchase goods and 
services, to invest, to save. You are 
taxed on that. That is what a progres-
sive system of taxation means. 
When you are having taxes taken out 
of your paycheck, or you owe taxes to 
your State and local government, you 
do not have that income left over. 
So let’s use an example. If someone 
earns $100,000 and they pay, as is typ-
ical in my district, $20,000 in State and 
local tax, that is not optional. They 
must pay that $20,000 under the law. 
What they have left to provide for their 
family, to save for college, to pay for 
housing, to do other things, is $80,000. 
That is the amount of income that the 
Federal Government should tax. 
What the SALT cap does is say to the 
family earning $100,000: You can only 
deduct $10,000, a completely arbitrary 
number. 
What that does is say to a family 
that only has $80,000 left because they 
had to pay the county, they had to pay 
the city, they had to pay for fire serv-
ices and school services. And they pay 
that money because they are proud of 
their community and they want our 
communities to thrive. But then they 
are taxed as if they have $90,000 avail-
able to them, but they don’t. They only 
have $80,000. 
So this whole idea of capping the 
State and local tax deduction is com-
pletely contrary to the entire basic 
theory of an income tax, which is you 
pay tax on your available income. If 
you owe money to the State and coun-
ty government, whether it is for prop-
erty tax or State or city taxes, you do 
not have that money left. 
In effect, these families are being 
asked to pay money and find money 
they do not have relative to their peers 
in other parts of the country. That is 
simply an unfair tax system. 
Mr. SUOZZI. It is very important, 
Congresswoman, what you point out. 
This is a mandatory payment. You are 
not spending the money to go on vaca-
tion; you are not spending money to go 
out to dinner; you are not building an 
addition onto your home. This is a 
mandatory expense that you must pay, 
as you said, to your county, to your 
village, or to your State. That is no 
longer available to you. 
In other States where the overall in-
come is exactly the same, but the man-
datory taking is much smaller, the tax 
bill is not as burdensome. 
Ms. PORTER. That is right. So the 
State and local tax deduction is really 
about saying that two families in two 
different States, trying to support 
themselves on the identical amount of 
income, ought to owe the same amount 
of Federal tax. That is what we are 
here to champion today. 
I am proud to be doing it with col-
leagues from across the country and 
across the aisle. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congresswoman, I want 
to thank you so much for being here. 
We have had some Republicans across 
the aisle here tonight. We have had 
some moderate Democrats here to-
night. And we have progressive Demo-
crats, such as yourself, here. 
I think it is important that we point 
out that actually the SALT deduction

is in keeping with progressive policy, 
because it supports those States that 
want to promote progressive policies 
within their States. 
Ms. PORTER. That is right. Because 
cities and counties depend on the re-
sources from State and local taxes to 
be able to pay for schools, to do a good 
job educating every single child, to 
make investments in roads and bridges, 
to pay first responders fair wages for 
putting their lives on the line to pro-
tect us. 
These are the kinds of policies that 
progressives champion, and we cannot 
ask our cities and our States and, most 
importantly, our fellow Americans to 
make those kinds of investments on 
the city, county, village, and local 
level, and then have the Federal Gov-
ernment treat them unfairly solely be-
cause they are trying to do right by 
each other in their community. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Congresswoman, thank 
you so much. We really appreciate you 
being here this evening to talk about 
this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER), back across to the other 
side of the country, one of my neigh-
bors and good friends who serves as the 
chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus. 
He has been one of the strongest advo-
cates for the reinstatement of the 
SALT deduction and the repeal of the 
SALT cap. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
we are here today representing tens of 
thousands of middle-class families, like 
those back in my home district in 
northern New Jersey, who got whacked 
with the 2017 tax hike bill, which gut-
ted our State and local tax deduction 
with the disastrous $10,000 cap. 
It is high time that Congress and the 
rest of the country heard just how 
badly these hardworking families have 
been hurt by the SALT cap. It is some-
thing I know we heard about a lot to-
night, and I really want to thank my 
dear friend TOM SUOZZI for his excel-
lent leadership on this issue. 
The usual naysayers continue to try 
to undermine our efforts to reinstate 
the State and local tax deduction, or 
SALT, by claiming it is just a give-
away to the wealthiest Americans. But 
anyone who actually lives in my dis-
trict in northern New Jersey knows 
that the $10,000 cap has hit middle- 
class families hard, many of whom are 
already struggling with high costs. 
It has also caused residents and jobs 
to leave our State. And now, with a de-
clining tax base, it’s threatening our 
best-in-class schools, teachers, law en-
forcement, firefighters, and our State’s 
services for hard-pressed families. 
The cap on the State and local tax 
deduction does not solely impact the 
highest earners. It has also increased 
taxes on scores of middle-class fami-
lies, as I said. It is a very important 
point to understand. 
In Bergen County, which is the larg-
est county I represent, for instance, be-
fore the cap was put in place, the aver-
age SALT deduction was above $24,000 
a year. Put another way, a married 
couple in Bergen County, a teacher and 
a law enforcement officer making a 
typical salary, could have had a SALT 
deduction of more than $17,000. 
According to reporting from New Jer-
sey’s Star-Ledger, if we reinstated the 
State and local tax deduction, nearly 
one-third of New Jersey residents, al-
most 3 million people, would get tax re-
lief. Yes, they would get a tax cut they 
so desperately need. As many as 80 per-
cent of them had incomes of $216,000 or 
less. 
Again, that is a firefighter and a 
teacher. That is hardly the 1 percent, 
especially in a high-cost-of-living area 
like New Jersey. I know the same thing 
is true of California, like we heard 
about from KATIE
PORTER, or TOM 
SUOZZI’s district in New York. 
We know that when taxes goes up, it 
leads to an exodus of middle class and 
higher earners in State likes ours. In 
fact, according to United Van Lines, 
ever since the SALT cap, New Jersey 
has been the number one out-migration 
State in the entire country. New Jer-
sey is losing its highest earners, and 
the disproportionate taxes they pay, to 
States like Florida, North Carolina, 
and Texas. That has only been exacer-
bated during the pandemic. 
The SALT cap is literally draining 
the tax base out of States like New 
Jersey that offer far better schools and 
government-supported 
services 
to 
middle- 
and 
lower-income 
families 
than our counterparts in other parts of 
the Nation. 
For instance, I mentioned $15,000 is 
the median property tax in Bergen 
County, New Jersey. If you go to Mis-
sissippi, their median property tax is 
$550 a year. 
The New York Times editorial board 
even once reiterated this point that I 
am trying to make, where we have 
good services for hard-pressed families 
in States like mine and other State I 
mentioned, like Mississippi or Ala-
bama, don’t have the resources to offer 
those kinds of services. 
So The New York Times editorial 
board made this point when they said 
that States like New Jersey and New 
York ‘‘generally do a better job of pro-
viding for the health and welfare of 
their citizens, and are more willing to 
pay for institutions that are good for 
society as a whole.’’ 
This is the difference between States 
like ours and moocher States like Mis-
sissippi and Alabama that tend not to 
give back to the people they represent. 
Thankfully, there is real bipartisan 
work taking place here in Congress to 
reinstate the SALT deduction, to get 
more money back in the pockets of 
Jersey middle-class families, and to 
help stop residents from moving out 
and eroding our State’s tax base. 
Along with Congressman SUOZZI, I 
have helped introduce the SALT De-
ductibility Act, a bipartisan bill to 
fully restore the deduction. 
In the SALT Caucus, with Congress-
man BILL PASCRELL, who spoke earlier, 
we are working in a bipartisan way 
with more than 30 Members to find a 
way to get this done in Congress and to 
actually get tax relief for the middle- 
class families we represent. I am very 
proud to co-chair that bipartisan cau-
cus. 
This tax cut of reinstating SALT can 
be a win-win for everyone. Let’s get the 
SALT deduction fully reinstated so 
that millions of Americans and fami-
lies nationwide can finally get some re-
lief. 
Working together in a bipartisan 
way, I believe we really can get this 
done so that our best days are always 
ahead of us. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Congressman 
GOTTHEIMER, thank you so much for 
pointing out all of those important 
points. 
I want to go back to one thing that 
you have mentioned here tonight. We 
have heard from Senator MCCONNELL 
and from others the concept of a blue 
State bailout, the idea that the SALT 
deduction is some sort of advantage for 
blue States. But you talked about how 
your State is actually a net donor to 
the Federal Government. 
Could you tell us a little bit more 
about that? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman for a colloquy. 
b 2030 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I would be happy to. 
One of the biggest challenges people 
don’t realize for States like New Jer-
sey, New York, Connecticut, and Cali-
fornia is how much our taxpayers pay 
into the Federal Government and, his-
torically, how we get back less in re-
turn than some of the other States in 
the country do. 
For instance, for every dollar that 
Mississippi sends to the Federal Gov-
ernment, they get $4.38 back. Alabama, 
I believe, receives $4.32 back. The State 
of Louisiana starts its budget every 
year with half coming from the Federal 
Government. 
States like Jersey, we get back 67 
cents, historically, on the dollar. 
What does that mean? It means that 
we pay lots of money to Washington. 
People like me are fighting to claw 
more back to Jersey, but we know that 
other States benefit more. 
When the tax hike bill passed in 2017, 
and the red States gutted the State 
and local tax deduction, capping it at 
$10,000, what they did was shift actu-
ally even more of the tax burden over 
to blue States like ours, and the red 
States benefited even more. 
It just reiterates, even more, the im-
portance of actually reinstating the 
State and local tax deduction, not only 
because, as KATIE PORTER said, it is 
double taxation and not only because it 
has been around since 1913 or even be-
fore for exactly this purpose. It is be-
cause we recognize that some States 
pay more than others, and we have to 
find ways to balance that out. Other-
wise, we are going to keep losing peo-
ple from States like ours to States like 
Florida and other red States.

Frankly, that is why it is so impor-
tant that we fight back to get tax re-
lief for the people that we represent, to 
make sure they can afford to live in 
our States and that we have a good tax 
base to be able to have great schools 
and stand by law enforcement, fire-
fighters, and others. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER has been a great champion 
on this issue. I am grateful to him for 
pointing that out. 
I know, in the case of my State of 
New York, in the past 5 years, New 
York has sent $150 billion more to the 
Federal Government than they have re-
ceived back in Federal services or Fed-
eral contracts, whereas MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s State in the past 5 years, this 
same period, they have received $150 
billion more in services and contracts 
than they have put back into the sys-
tem. 
The gentleman’s advocacy on this 
issue has been stellar. I am grateful to 
him for being here tonight. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman SUOZZI for put-
ting together this Special Order hour. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the time that my colleagues 
and I have had tonight to make these 
different points. 
I want to close by saying this is 
about fairness. It is not fair. 
It is not fair that the State and local 
tax deduction has been in place for 
over 100 years so State and local gov-
ernments have relied on this deduction 
in order to fund the programs that we 
have. 
It is not fair that people are being 
taxed on taxes that they have already 
paid. 
It is not fair that the taxes that are 
being paid in these States are no longer 
deductible on people’s income tax re-
turns. 
It is not fair that, after all these 
years of relying on this deduction, it is 
no longer in place, and my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle have been 
boasting about people leaving my State 
and going to their States while we are, 
in fact, subsidizing those very States. 
This is a battle that is going to con-
tinue. Hopefully, over the next few 
months, we will be able to build a coa-
lition, together, of Democrats and Re-
publicans who recognize that this un-
fairness has to be addressed and that 
we need to restore the State and local 
tax deduction for the benefit of the 
residents of my State and people 
throughout the United States of Amer-
ica who are relying on basic fairness. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of ending the cap on State 
and Local Tax deductions—better known as 
the SALT deduction. 
For more than 100 years, an idea dating 
back to Abraham Lincoln, the SALT deduction 
has allowed families to deduct taxes already 
paid to state and local government from their 
federal tax returns. 
Many middle-class Americans benefit from 
this commonsense tax policy every year. In 
past years, almost a third of Rhode Islanders 
have claimed the SALT deductions, including 
almost 60 percent of people in my district who 
make between $75–100,000 per year. 
The destructive 2017 Trump tax cuts, how-
ever, imposed a $10,000 cap on SALT deduc-
tions, meaning that if a family pays more than 
$10,000 in state and local taxes, the taxes 
paid in excess of that $10,000 can no longer 
be deducted from federal returns raising those 
families’ tax liability significantly. 
It just doesn’t make sense to have Ameri-
cans, especially middle-class families living in 
states with high tax rates, pay extra taxes on 
the taxes they have already paid. 
Most middle-class Americans living in high 
tax areas are there so their children can go to 
high caliber public schools or receive better 
programs. 
Many of them made 10, 20, and 30-year in-
vestments in home ownership in these high 
tax areas, relying on the SALT deduction that 
had been in place for more than 100 years 
when budgeting for this big expense. 
Then they had the rug pulled out from under 
them and were told they were suddenly liable 
for thousands of dollars more in taxes per 
year. For many of these people, that extra tax 
is a significant portion of their annual income. 
These Americans are working hard to give 
their families the best life possible. Putting a 
secondary tax on the taxes they have already 
paid will force many middle-class Americans 
to struggle. 
In fact, middle-class Americans have said 
that the SALT Cap will, quote: ‘‘wipe them 
out’’ by forcing them to pay those extra federal 
taxes in addition to state and local. 
This is why I cosponsored H.R. 613, the 
SALT Deductibility Act, this Congress. 
This bipartisan bill would reverse the 2017 
law and allow Americans to use the SALT de-
ductions when paying federal taxes without a 
$10,000 cap, keeping money in the hands of 
American working families. 
I applaud Congressman SUOZZI for intro-
ducing this important legislation. It will have a 
significant impact to help American families, 
which is especially important after the dev-
astating economic effect of COVID–19 that 
has left so many middle-class Americans 
struggling financially, including many Rhode 
Islanders. 
The 2017 law was more than a mistake, it 
was bad policy, and I hope that this body does 
the right thing by taking action to correct it. 
f 
SUPPORTING STRONG NATIONAL 
SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of strong national se-
curity policies, policies like the remain 
in Mexico policy, enforcement of our 
existing interior immigration laws, and 
the completion of key miles of fencing 
and technology that protect our south-
west border—policies, Madam Speaker, 
that President Biden hastily removed 
on his first day in office, without any 
plan to replace them. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
in the House and Senate supported end-
ing those Trump-era policies. Those 
policies, Madam Speaker, were work-
ing to rein in the flow of illegal immi-
gration. 
Now, with no plan and no substi-
tution, the result is pure political the-
ater, simply because those were Trump 
policies. While they were working, 
President Biden stopped them. 
President 
Biden 
appointed 
Vice 
President HARRIS to serve as the border 
czar. One would think that she would 
act in critical ways to replace those 
national security policies that were 
working under the Trump administra-
tion and that President Biden ended. 
Not only did she not present solutions 
to the historic number of hundreds of 
thousands of immigrants who were 
pouring across our southern border, but 
she refused to visit the border for near-
ly 100 days since being appointed bor-
der czar. 
She even laughed at the idea of vis-
iting the border, comparing it to tak-
ing a trip to Europe. Finally, after 
cries from the American people and 
calls from House and Senate Repub-
licans, she did agree to take a trip to 
the border. 
Madam Speaker, I have been to the 
border seven times over the past 51⁄2 
years, most recently in April. Specifi-
cally, I traveled to the Rio Grande sec-
tor in the Rio Grande Valley. The con-
ditions I found there were worse than I 
have seen on my previous trips. In fact, 
Border Patrol estimates that the drug 
cartels in Mexico made $400 million in 
February alone in human trafficking. 
Think about that, Madam Speaker: 
$400 million in one month by charging 
$5,000 to $9,000 to traffic hundreds of 
thousands of people across the border, 
some innocent, some not. 
These drug and human trafficking 
challenges are just part of the crisis at 
the border because while Customs and 
Border Patrol are working on the hu-
manitarian elements of this crisis, 
drugs are coming across the border and 
criminals are coming across the border. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, we have 
interdicted in the first 6 months of this 
year enough fentanyl to kill all in 
America. It is shocking that we have 
interdicted that much fentanyl drug 
that it could kill everyone in this 
country because it only takes the 
amount in a Sweet’N Low packet, 
Madam Speaker, to kill 500 Americans. 
This is a deadly drug. 
The Vice President chose to visit El 
Paso. El Paso is nearly 1,000 miles west 
of the Rio Grande Valley, where this 
crisis has its epicenter. If she had gone 
to the Rio Grande Valley, she would 
have seen cartels dropping off migrant 
families by the dozens and holding 
camps for migrant families struggling 
to get the water, time, and care that 
they need. 
Regardless of who designed the poli-
cies, the Biden administration should 
be for stronger national security poli-
cies on the border. But the Biden bor-
der crisis is out of control, and it is 
going to take more than a short public 
relations visit to El Paso to fix it.

ANNOUNCING AMERICAN HOSTAGE TASK FORCE 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to announce that the Congres-
sional 
Task 
Force 
on 
Americans 
Wrongfully Detained Abroad has been 
initiated by Congressman TED DEUTCH 
from Florida and myself. 
The inspiration for me to form this 
task force was Majd Kamalmaz, a 
former resident of central Arkansas 
who was traveling to Syria to attend a 
family funeral where he was wrongfully 
detained and has been held in Syria 
ever since. I am dedicated to bringing 
him home safely to his family. 
Having a loved one detained or held 
hostage abroad is unimaginable. It is a 
heartbreaking experience for any fam-
ily. 
Representative DEUTCH and I created 
this task force not only to help these 
struggling families but to be a resource 
for our colleagues in the House, as 
there are over 50 families here in Amer-
ica who are struggling with a member 
of their family held abroad. We want to 
help Members of Congress help their 
constituents cope with this issue. 
Every channel of the United States 
Government should be working to 
bring these Americans home and to 
disincentivize the wrongful detention 
of Americans in the future, by state ac-
tors or nonstate actors. 
Madam Speaker, I am committed to 
bringing Majd Kamalmaz home to his 
family. TED DEUTCH and I are com-
mitted to using this task force to bring 
other Americans wrongfully detained 
home, into the arms of their loved 
ones. 
MARKING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CCP 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, a century 
ago, the Chinese Communists took con-
trol of one of the great countries in 
global history. The Chinese Communist 
Party marks, this month, a century 
since the beginning of China’s descent 
into authoritarianism. 
Just 
as 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party used violence to impose its will 
onto the Chinese people during the Chi-
nese Civil War, now it uses that same 
violence and threat of violence to crush 
any dissent within its borders. 
We saw this last summer, when the 
CCP silenced the democratic voices of 
Hong Kong, swiftly marching troops 
into the city to stop demonstrations 
for freedom. Beijing has blatantly ig-
nored the terms of its 50-year treaty 
with the United Kingdom and ignored 
Hong Kong’s legislature, arresting pro- 
democracy activists and lawmakers en 
masse and crushing a long history of 
press freedom with the recent closing 
of Apple Daily. 
As I speak, over a million Uighurs 
and other Muslims have been interned 
in concentration camps for reeduca-
tion. Families have been separated, 
lives destroyed, and cultures all but 
erased in the name of the magnificent 
Chinese Communist Party’s ultimate 
authority. 
Respect for human rights is a funda-
mental tenet of American foreign pol-
icy. The continued suffering of the 
Uighurs, the citizens of Hong Kong— 
and all other individual rights of 
speech, privacy, assembly, and reli-
gious belief are trampled by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
It is no 100-year celebration here on 
the House floor, Madam Speaker. The 
American people stand with the hard-
working people of China. The Congress 
of the United States stands with the 
hardworking people of China, and we 
will work to continue to advocate for 
freedom of people, assembly, belief, and 
press in China. 
APPLAUDING FBI CYBER BUSTS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the tireless 
dedication of members of the FBI in re-
cently seizing approximately $2.3 mil-
lion from the hacker group responsible 
for the Colonial Pipeline ransomware 
attack. 
After the Colonial Pipeline paid the 
hackers the entire $4.4 million ransom, 
and with the money seemingly lost for-
ever due to bitcoin encryption, these 
FBI agents were able to recover more 
than half of the demanded sum. 
I am also proud to recognize that the 
FBI conducted 800 arrests in 16 coun-
tries thanks to an encrypted messaging 
app it developed as part of a 3-year dig-
ital sting operation on international 
crime. 
Just as encrypted, untraceable com-
munications have become pervasive in 
how criminal enterprise operates on a 
global scale, ransomware attacks have 
been on the rise as they prey on the 
digital vulnerability of our businesses 
and infrastructure, often with little 
hope of recovery or justice. 
I applaud the vigilance and ingenious 
methods of the investigating agents 
and encourage their continued efforts 
to ensure safety in our digital age. 
REINTRODUCING COPTIC CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my resolution, H. 
Res. 117, which calls on the Egyptian 
Government to end the culture of im-
punity for attacks on Christians and to 
undertake the arrest, prosecution, and 
conviction of individuals who carry out 
attacks on Copts and other Christians 
in Egypt. 
I was the lead on a nearly identical 
resolution in previous Congresses. I 
truly appreciate the support I received 
from my original cosponsor, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), and nearly 50 of my House 
colleagues who have cosponsored the 
resolution in this Congress. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Egypt 
and 
the 
United States are important partners 
in the fight against terrorism. Egypt’s 
role at Camp David has led to some of 
the closest ties between the United 
States, Egypt, and Israel in their his-
tory, and we are grateful for their most 
recent engagement between the terror 
group Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the 
Government of Israel. 
Madam Speaker, I respect President 
el-Sisi and his good relationship with 
the Coptic Pope. He has attended Mass 
on multiple occasions. He has had some 
churches reconstructed, and he has 
constructed the largest Christian ca-
thedral in the Middle East in the new 
administrative center in Egypt. And 
President el-Sisi is relentless in hold-
ing terrorists accountable for their 
atrocities. 
b 2045 
People all around the world, regard-
less of their religious affiliation de-
serve the same freedom to practice 
their chosen religion like we have en-
joyed here in the United States for 
more than 200 years. 
The respect for human rights and re-
ligious freedom is a fundamental tenet 
of American foreign policy. I will con-
tinue to advocate for the Coptic Chris-
tians and all Egyptians, be they Chris-
tian or Muslim, who together take 
their water from the Nile. 
ARKANSANS SHOULD CHECK THE STATUS OF 
THEIR PASSPORTS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge all Arkansans to check 
the status of their passports well be-
fore traveling. 
Due to backlogs in the State Depart-
ment, passport renewals by mail are 
taking longer than usual. There is a 
backlog of up to 10 weeks for their ex-
pedited service and 18 weeks for their 
regular service. 
This lag in service at the State De-
partment is affecting Arkansans want-
ing to travel for mission trips, study 
abroad, or take a family trip in the 
aftermath of the pandemic. 
So far, my office has helped 70 people 
this year receive their passports, and 
we have opened more than 90 cases in 
the past 6 months. And this compares 
to opening cases and receiving pass-
ports of only about 200 in the 5 previous 
years 
So, to my friends in Arkansas, check 
your passport prior to your trip, and if 
it is expired, get it renewed as soon as 
possible 
I encourage everyone to stay up to 
date on passport services and travel 
advisories and to check COVID–19 pro-
tocols, masks, testing, and quarantine 
issues before you travel. 
ARKANSANS MUST GET VACCINATED 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage all Arkansans who 
are 
not 
currently 
vaccinated 
for 
COVID–19 to consult with their doctor 
about getting the COVID–19 vaccine. 
The best way to combat the spread of 
these COVID variants is by receiving 
the vaccine. As more information and 
research develops around the delta var-
iant of the coronavirus, I want to en-
sure that all Arkansans stay safe and 
remain healthy as we prepare for this 
spread. 
The only way that we can fully re-
open our economy and get truly back 
on our feet is with more people being 
vaccinated for COVID–19.

RECOGNIZING GREAT OUTDOORS MONTH 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize that June is Great 
Outdoors Month and recognize the 
great conservation work of my col-
leagues in Arkansas in the Governor’s 
office and at the Arkansas Department 
of Parks and Tourism. 
As a lifelong outdoorsman living in 
The Natural State, I have a lot of pride 
in recognizing June as Great Outdoors 
Month. For 9 generations, my family 
has lived in Arkansas and enjoyed the 
extraordinary natural beauty through-
out our State. 
I agree with many of the earliest con-
servationists in protecting our wildlife 
and our wild places and that can be 
done through reasonable and realistic 
means, and I am proud to continue my 
work in central Arkansas. 
Just last week, I joined Governor Asa 
Hutchinson and Secretary of Parks and 
Tourism Stacy Hurst in announcing 
the new Office of Outdoor Recreation 
and the addition of a great new wild 
place in central Arkansas: Blue Moun-
tain just west of Pinnacle Mountain. 
Just west of Rattlesnake Ridge, Blue 
Mountain will be a new opportunity for 
hiking, mountain biking, and enjoying 
the 
extraordinary 
view 
of 
Lake 
Maumelle from the Nature Conser-
vancy and the Arkansas Department of 
Heritage’s latest partnership to expand 
outdoor recreation. 
In the same announcement, the Gov-
ernor announced that our parks and 
tourism department would work with 
the Ouachita National Forest and open 
up Lake Sylvia Recreation Area and 
the old Camp Ouachita to year-round 
participation by Arkansans. This is a 
great partnership between the Federal 
Government and the State government 
to offer more outdoor recreation oppor-
tunities for our families to enjoy in 
The Natural State. 
THE NATIONAL PERSONNEL RECORDS CENTER 
MUST GO DIGITAL 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring awareness to the dif-
ficulty for many to obtain a critical 
document for our veterans: That is 
their form DD–214. 
You can’t do anything as a veteran 
without a copy of your DD–214. This pa-
perwork is required to verify for our 
servicemembers their benefits, how to 
obtain a disability claim, funeral serv-
ice, research about lost medals. We 
need a copy of your DD–214. 
Well, the pandemic has not been good 
for this need for the millions of vet-
erans in our country. The National 
Personnel Records Center shut down, 
and as we come out of the pandemic 
when our veterans need these re-
sources, they are still terribly behind, 
despite Congress appropriating more 
money. 
It is critical that the National Per-
sonnel Records Center go digital so 
that we can properly verify these serv-
icemembers and give better service for 
those who have served their country in 
such a valuable way. 
It should not be difficult for our vet-
erans to get their DD–214 to pursue 
their benefits or claim healthcare at 
our 
Veterans 
Administration. 
It 
shouldn’t be a burden to a spouse, to a 
family of a fallen veteran to have the 
proper paperwork to have a proper fu-
neral. 
So I urge my colleagues to join me 
and continue to press the National Ar-
chives to improve their service for the 
bravest men and women and their fam-
ilies. 
RECOGNIZING STEVE WELLS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the accomplish-
ments and retirement of Catholic High 
School teacher and longtime friend Mr. 
Steve Wells. 
Mr. Wells has been teaching at 
Catholic High School in Little Rock, 
Arkansas, for 38 years. His decision to 
end his long service at the school, hav-
ing graduated there in 1973, is recog-
nized by many as the end of an era at 
CHS. 
Steve’s a native of north Little Rock 
and came back to the school as a sub-
stitute English teacher in 1983. The 
teacher for which he was substituting 
never returned, and Steve Wells has 
been teaching there ever since. 
When you walk into our beloved 
Catholic High there is a quote that is 
above the front door. It says: ‘‘Come 
boys, so that you may become men.’’ 
Mr. Wells did exactly that. And he 
served as a teacher and a role model for 
generations of students throughout the 
years. 
I 
congratulate 
my 
friend, 
Steve 
Wells, on a dedicated career of helping 
boys become men and wish him the 
very best in his retirement. 
RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS’ WOMEN VETERANS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of Women’s Armed Serv-
ices Integration Act. I am proud to rec-
ognize the more than 20,000 women vet-
erans in Arkansas. 
Women have been serving in the mili-
tary in different capacities for more 
than a century. Women like Deborah 
Sampson, who fought in the Revolu-
tionary War, and Loretta Walsh, Amer-
ica’s first official enlisted woman of 
any service. 
They pioneered the way for women to 
serve in the United States Armed 
Forces. And with more women serving 
now than ever before at any time in 
our history, action is being taken to 
continue and build a positive environ-
ment for women in the armed services. 
Further, our Veterans Administration 
continues its efforts to enhance fami-
lies, facilities, and services for our 
growing number of female veterans in 
Arkansas. 
I thank the women of our armed 
services for their dedication and serv-
ice to our country. 
RECOGNIZING GRACIE LEE, ALYSSA HUIE, 
RANDILYNN STRIPLING, AND CATHERINE MILLS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize four incredible 
young women on the Clinton Arkansas 
Future Farmers of America team. 
Together, Gracie Lee, Alyssa Huie, 
Randilynn Stripling, and Catherine 
Mills made history by being the first 
all-female team to win not one, but 
two State competitions in electricity. 
Due to the pandemic, the team was 
allowed to compete in the State con-
test a second time, making them back- 
to-back State champions in electricity. 
This team serves as a great example 
to all the young Arkansans that are 
committed to working hard and being 
pioneers in their fields. I applaud them 
for their diligence and determination. 
This team demonstrated great dedi-
cation, and I am incredibly proud to 
represent these history-making young 
women and all young Arkansans in 
central Arkansas. 
RECOGNIZING MELVIN WILLIAMS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the determination 
of Little Rock native, Melvin Williams. 
A terrible and unfortunate injury in 
high school ended his football dreams. 
His grades slipped, and Melvin dropped 
out of school. 
Years later, Melvin had earned his 
high school diploma at a program at 
Goodwill Industries. The Excel Center 
at Goodwill is a fully accredited and 
cost-free public high school in Little 
Rock for adults 19 and older. 
Not only is Mr. Williams now work-
ing toward a business degree at the 
University of Arkansas Pulaski Tech, 
he is one of Goodwill’s newest employ-
ees. He is in charge of recruitment and 
retention at Goodwill. 
Goodwill Industries of Arkansas CEO 
Brian Marsh says, ‘‘Melvin is exactly 
who we need for this role.’’ 
I congratulate Melvin on his accom-
plishments and for being a wonderful 
representative for Goodwill Industries. 
CONGRATULATING ELLIS FREEL 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Miss Ellis Freel 
on being a recipient of the Congres-
sional Award Gold Medal. 
The Congressional Award Gold Medal 
requires the recipient to complete a 
minimum of 400 hours of volunteer 
service, 200 hours of personal develop-
ment, and 200 hours of physical fitness 
and 5 days of exploration or expedition. 
Miss Freel cites the most challenging 
obstacle in completing the require-
ments of being a gold medalist as her 5- 
day wilderness expedition. Due to re-
strictions from the pandemic, Ellis had 
to make adjustments that taught her 
patience and flexibility. 
Miss Freel serves as a wonderful 
asset to her hometown of Bryant, Ar-
kansas, her college campus at the Uni-
versity of Arkansas and to Arkansas’ 
Second Congressional District.

RECOGNIZING FINALISTS OF THE ARKANSAS 
STATE CODING COMPETITION 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the finalists from 
central Arkansas in the fifth annual 
Arkansas State Coding competition 
and a finalist for the Arkansas Com-
puter Science Educator of the Year 
Award. 
The team taking third place at the 
State coding competition this year was 
from eStem High School in my home-
town of Little Rock. The three-person 
team included Elijah Keen, Spencer 
Knight, and Sergio Markin. Each stu-
dent received a 529 college savings plan 
worth $500, in addition to winning $4000 
for their school. 
Also, a special congratulations to 
Kimberly Raup for being a finalist in 
the 2021 Computer Science Educator of 
the 
Year 
Award. 
She 
teaches 
at 
Conway High School, and she received 
a $2,500 award for being named a final-
ist. 
Congratulations to these students 
and to Ms. Raup on their awards, and a 
special thank you to the University of 
Arkansas at Little Rock for hosting 
this event. 
It is events like this that allow our 
central Arkansas students to showcase 
their coding and STEM talents to show 
the importance of computer science for 
our youth. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I bring 
birthday greetings to our beloved Na-
tion. I rise today to celebrate freedom 
and independence and democracy right 
here in the United States. 
b 2100 
Madam Speaker, 245 years ago, our 
brave Founding Fathers gathered to-
gether in Philadelphia to sign the Dec-
laration of Independence. And on that 
hot July, in that stuffy room in Phila-
delphia, they came together to change 
world history, to change history here 
in the United States, and to open up a 
lifetime of opportunity for generations 
of Americans yet unborn. 
Madam Speaker, what amazes me 
about that time is that small com-
mittee of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas 
Jefferson, 
John 
Adams, 
thinking 
through of how would we break with 
Great Britain, how would America 
leave Great Britain. 
Madam Speaker, Jefferson was con-
cerned. In his rough draft, he said of 
Great Britain and the United States: 
‘‘We might have been a free and great 
people together.’’ 
Those words are not placed in the 
final copy of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, but it shows the struggle 
that the Founding Fathers had and 
Thomas Jefferson had as a principal 
author of how to make that break with 
a people they had respect for, and a 
king and a king’s policies they de-
spised. 
‘‘We might have been a free and great 
people together.’’ 
But think of the momentous feelings 
they had, the prayers they had every 
day on their knees for strength to take 
on the most powerful country in the 
world, with the most powerful Navy 
and military in the world. 
As Jefferson said: ‘‘ . . . it becomes 
necessary for one people to dissolve the 
political bands which have connected 
them with another . . . ’’ To pursue 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
Jefferson, while he didn’t include 
that statement about being partners as 
a free people going forward, he argued, 
‘‘we have appealed to their’’—the Brit-
ish—‘‘native 
justice 
and 
magna-
nimity.’’ And they were rejected. 
Madam Speaker, think of the bravery 
there. As the signers of the Declara-
tion, those Founders came together 
and said in the final closing words of 
the Declaration of Independence: ‘‘And 
for the support of this Declaration, 
with a firm reliance on the protection 
of divine Providence, we mutually 
pledge to each other our lives, our for-
tunes, and our sacred honor.’’ 
And they did that for those genera-
tions of Americans unborn in this great 
land. 
So 245 years later, we have proven 
our resilience and our strength once 
again in coming through the pandemic, 
defeating COVID–19. And I am opti-
mistic about the future of our beloved 
country. While it has been challenging 
over the last year and a few months, 
but compared to the challenges those 
Founders faced, compared to the chal-
lenges this country has faced many, 
many 
times 
before, 
we 
show 
our 
strength, we show our true mettle, we 
pull through as one Nation under God 
many times before. 
So on this Fourth of July, I invite all 
Americans to celebrate our country’s 
birthday with their friends and family. 
Honor our cherished freedoms. And 
may we never forget the sacrifices of 
those generations before us in public 
service, in uniform, on the battlefield, 
who have sacrificed so much so that we 
may enjoy those freedoms that we have 
today. God bless each of you and God 
bless our great country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ESSENTIAL CAREGIVERS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
before you today to share the heart-
breaking 
stories 
from 
Americans 
around the country, including my own 
district, who were cut off from their 
loved ones in long-term care facilities 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
For the next several months in this 
Chamber, I will share harrowing testi-
mony submitted to my office from 
these families. 
Essential caregivers were prohibited 
from entering nursing homes, group 
homes, and other long-term care facili-
ties to provide an extra level of care 
and love, which is so desperately need-
ed and deserved by those who call these 
facilities home. 
Over the past year, long-term care fa-
cility residents suffered in isolation. 
Alone, many lost the will to live, and 
many others deteriorated physically 
and mentally. 
While we cannot go back in time to 
fix what has been done, we can take 
steps today to prevent this from ever 
happening again. If Congress fails to 
act, we could see thousands more 
Americans die or suffer in isolation 
again. 
I have introduced the bipartisan Es-
sential Caregivers Act to fight for the 
rights of our seniors, our constituents 
living in group homes with disabilities, 
and anyone who resides in a long-term 
care facility. This also includes young 
children with developmental disabil-
ities. 
Under Federal law, residents in long- 
term care facilities have a right to re-
ceive visitors at any time. But during 
the pandemic, this right was curtailed 
completely. Many residents, including 
children with disabilities and seniors, 
were not allowed access to loved ones 
who had been caring for them prior to 
the pandemic. This took a tremendous 
toll on them. 
My bipartisan bill addresses this 
issue by striking a commonsense com-
promise. It implements a new Federal 
standard that will end this indignity. 
This bill permits each facility resident 
to designate up to two essential care-
givers who will be provided safe, rea-
sonable, and transparent access to resi-
dents during any future public health 
emergency. 
The Essential Caregivers Act is a 
compassionate step to ensure the most 
vulnerable among us never suffer alone 
again. 
Why is this so important? 
Because essential caregivers aren’t 
just visitors; they are, as the name im-
plies, caregivers who help with activi-
ties of daily living and provide emo-
tional support and companionship. 
This care enriches the lives of resi-
dents, enhances their well-being, and 
helps them thrive personally and so-
cially. Without it, residents ultimately 
suffer. This is exactly what we saw dur-
ing the 15-month lockdown. 
The importance of the essential care-
givers in no way diminishes the critical 
role that facility staff place in resi-
dents’ lives, which during this pan-
demic was nothing short of heroic. Es-
sential caregivers simply supplement 
the care provided by facility staff. 
They are a force multiplier that en-
hances the ability of residents to 
thrive and to live their lives fully. 
Importantly, this bill upholds strict 
safety and health standards to protect 
residents, staff, and caregivers. Any es-
sential caregiver must comply with 
whatever health standards are put in 
place by a facility. This includes re-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3302 
June 29, 2021 
In my home State of New York, one 
of the greatest tragedies of the COVID– 
19 pandemic was the suffering of those 
living in nursing and group homes. 
First, they suffered because of Gov-
ernor Cuomo’s negligent policy to re-
turn COVID-positive patients to long- 
term care facilities. Then they suffered 
by not being able to access the care-
givers they depended on for so many 
years. 
Today I want to tell their stories not 
only from the constituents I represent 
in New York, but also from those 
around the country who similarly suf-
fered. 
First, we remember the life of Ana 
Martinez. Vivian Zayas and Alexa Ri-
vera are the cofounders of Voices for 
Seniors. Their mother is Ana Martinez, 
who was supposed to undergo a few 
weeks of physical therapy in West 
Islip, New York. But because of Gov-
ernor Cuomo’s COVID mandates, Viv-
ian and Alexa were unable to tell their 
mother good-bye before she passed 
away after contracting COVID in the 
facility. 
Vivian and Alexa has since made it 
their life’s mission to see that no one 
else endures the hardships they experi-
enced being cut off from their own 
mother. 
We remember the life of Daniel 
Alvino. Tracey Alvino is the daughter 
of Daniel Alvino. Daniel was a veteran 
and a football fanatic. His family 
meant the world to him. His laugh was 
the highlight of all of their holiday 
parties. 
In March 2020, Daniel was placed into 
a rehab facility in a New York nursing 
home after having neck surgery. Under 
Cuomo’s nursing mandate, Tracey had 
no access to her father for a significant 
period of time. Daniel fell very ill and 
had to be rushed to a hospital and 
placed on a ventilator. 
On April 14, 2020, Daniel Alvino 
passed away at the age of 76. It wasn’t 
until a year later that his family fi-
nally held his funeral to commemorate 
his life that was cut far too short. 
This 
evening, 
we 
remember 
Mr. 
Alvino. 
We also remember the life of John 
Daly. John Daly was a husband, father 
of five, grandfather of nine, and a Ma-
rine veteran who served on the front 
lines in Korea. He and his wife, Mary, 
were together for 63 years until the day 
he entered the Gurwin Jewish Nursing 
Home and Rehabilitation Center at the 
time lockdowns were put in place. 
John spent 20 days at the facility 
after having been hospitalized with 
pneumonia. Having suffered a minor 
stroke previously, John had limited 
use of his left arm and needed assist-
ance. 
b 2110 
Madam Speaker, his wife was the one 
who was normally there to help him in 
the facility, but she was cut off from 
him completely. She was no longer able 
to see John and received only infre-
quent phone calls. 
Once his rehab was over, the family 
picked him up to find that he was no 
longer able to walk. His condition had 
deteriorated significantly. In a matter 
of days, the family had to choose be-
tween hospice or fighting for his life. 
They chose to fight. 
Sadly, because of the isolation he 
faced, John was not eating enough to 
live. Sadly, John lost his life on May 
24, 2020. 
The family feels strongly that if his 
wife had been by his side, giving him 
the love and care that he needed, he 
would be with us today. 
This evening, we remember John 
Daly. 
Madam Speaker, we also remember 
the life of Rosemary Abraham. Karla 
Abraham-Conley is the daughter of 
Rosemary Abraham. Rosemary was ad-
mitted to a long-term care facility in 
September 2019. 
Before the pandemic, Karla was by 
her mother’s side as a caregiver. She 
took her to lunch, brought her to fam-
ily dinners, and provided help with the 
day-to-day activities. 
When March 2020 arrived, Karla was 
cut off from her mother completely. 
After months of isolation, speaking 
only over the phone, Karla noticed the 
toll that it was having on her mother’s 
health. 
Window visits were brutal and con-
fusing for her mother. Karla’s mother 
simply did not understand why Karla 
wasn’t allowed in to see her. 
As they spoke over FaceTime, Karla 
watched her mother deteriorate. Only 
after Karla pleaded for someone to care 
for her mother was she eventually sent 
to the emergency room due to poor 
health. 
Sadly, Rosemary Abraham died 7 
days later, on October 4, 2020. She died 
from isolation, failure to thrive, and 
neglect. 
If Karla had been allowed to be in the 
facility with her mother, she would 
likely be alive today. 
This evening, we remember Rose-
mary Abraham and remember that 
Karla Abraham-Conley was one of the 
people who inspired us to put together 
and to draft the Essential Caregivers 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, we also recognize 
the suffering of Susan Wilson. Robert 
Wilson is married to Susan Wilson. She 
is a retired pediatric nurse who suf-
fered a major hemorrhagic stroke that 
left her paralyzed on the right side. Her 
speech was limited, as was her ability 
to perform daily living activities. 
She did not get COVID, nor did she 
die in the long-term care facility, but 
she has suffered severe damage by the 
extended lockdown. 
For a full 7 months, he was excluded 
from seeing her. Even though she was 
in an excellent nursing home, her care 
and her emotional, physical, and men-
tal state deteriorated significantly. 
No staff, no matter how good, can 
provide only what an essential care-
giver can provide. His wife was admit-
ted to the hospital twice. Her speech 
deteriorated. She lost the ability to use 
her 
nondominant 
hand. 
She 
lost 
progress on relearning how to walk and 
is now confined to a wheelchair. 
In his formal testimony, Robert said: 
‘‘I am not a visitor. I am Susan’s voice, 
her only voice. She should never have 
been subjected to the isolation, and 
you all have the ability to keep it from 
happening again.’’ 
This evening, we recognize Susan’s 
suffering. The Essential Caregivers Act 
would have protected Susan’s rights 
and allowed critical access for John to 
continue for her care. 
Madam Speaker, we also recognize 
the suffering of Gina Zanchelli. Dolores 
Zanchelli was the caretaker of her 
mother, Gina, who lived in a skilled 
nursing facility in Long Island, New 
York. 
Dolores visited her mother every day 
to provide the extra care that the facil-
ity was not able to deliver each day. 
Having access to her mother allowed 
Dolores the chance to monitor her 
mother’s health closely. 
Once lockdowns went into effect, Do-
lores was cut off from her mother, who 
became depressed from being isolated. 
Physical therapy stopped, and the nec-
essary care she needed was deemed un-
essential in the facility. 
Delores and her mother were limited 
to 
only 
video 
calls 
during 
the 
lockdown. After Dolores went through 
a rigorous process to see her mother, 
she was able to have three socially 
distanced visits over the course of 13 
months, about 10 to 15 minutes each, 
but the isolation had already taken its 
toll. 
Gina’s rights were violated, and the 
damage that resulted physically and 
mentally has been irreversible. In Do-
lores’ words: ‘‘This should never be al-
lowed to happen again.’’ 
This evening, we recognize the suf-
fering of Gina Zanchelli. 
Madam Speaker, we also recognize 
the suffering of Lynn Ray Leljedal. 
Prior to COVID, Carrie had never been 
away from her son, Lynn, for more 
than 9 days. He was 32 when COVID 
shut down all the long-term care facili-
ties. 
Lynn was born with a rare seizure 
disorder 
called 
Sturge-Weber 
syn-
drome. At 16 years old, he had to have 
the right side of his brain disconnected 
to control seizures. 
Lynn moved into a long-term care fa-
cility in 2013. His mother, Carrie, has 
always been a hands-on mom. She 
never just went to visit; she would 
spend hours with her son, cleaning his 
room and eating meals with him and 
the other residents. Some nights, she 
would just go over to help him get 
ready for bed. 
In March 2020, Carrie was told that 
the facility was closed to all visitors. 
Her heart dropped. For over 4 months, 
she was only able to see Lynn through 
a window or through a virtual visit. 
When she was finally allowed to see 
Lynn, it was only at doctor’s appoint-
ments. The distance took its toll on 
them.

June 29, 2021 
As Carrie said in her testimony to 
me: ‘‘There is only one way to ensure 
that any resident of long-term care 
never faces this again. This is by pass-
ing H.R. 3733, the Essential Caregivers 
Act.’’ 
Madam Speaker, these are heart- 
wrenching stories that show exactly 
why we need to pass the Essential 
Caregivers Act. Had this law been in 
place, these residents would not have 
suffered alone in isolation, and their 
caregivers would have been there to 
safely provide the supplemental care 
that is so critical. Individuals we lost 
may have been with us today. 
This bill is about protecting the 
rights of the most vulnerable among 
us. 
Madam Speaker, the stories I shared 
with you this evening only scratch the 
surface of the suffering individuals and 
families endured around the country. 
Madam Speaker, I have personally 
received hundreds of pages, and I will 
show them to you. This is just some of 
the 
gut-wrenching 
testimony 
from 
families who have been through excru-
ciating 
circumstances 
fighting 
for 
their loved ones’ rights. 
To read it all would take hours, 
which is why I will post every page of 
it on my website. Let it be a perma-
nent reminder of the need for this body 
to pass the act. 
Each of these stories, we will try to 
get them through. We have another 
year and a half left of the term to try 
to get them through Special Orders or 
other ways on the floor so that these 
people can be properly recognized. 
Before I close, I want to share some

Each of these individuals submitted 
testimony to my office that is just as 
powerful and compelling as the seven 
stories I shared with you this evening. 
As I said, I will post these testi-
monies on my website and, hopefully, 
throughout the next year and a half, I 
will be able to speak about each one of 
these people who have given essential 
care on behalf of a family member and 
the loss that these people suffered over 
the next several months. 
I encourage each member of this 
body to take time to read these stories 
and hear the pleas of those who suf-
fered. The one bit of solace I take from 
these stories is that the elected Mem-
bers of Congress here tonight can do 
something to prevent these tragedies 
from ever happening again. 
We stand together and support pas-
sage of the bipartisan Essential Care-
givers Act. It will protect these indi-
viduals and their loved ones from any 
future harm. 
I want to close by thanking Con-
gressman LARSON from Connecticut for 
leading this bipartisan effort with me. 
I also want to thank the bill’s other co-
sponsors: ELISE STEFANIK, JOHN RUTH-
ERFORD, YVETTE
HERRELL, MADISON

CAWTHORN, ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, TED 
BUDD, JEFF
VAN
DREW, and STEVE 
COHEN. 
Tomorrow morning, I will be joined 
by caregivers from all over the country 
at the Capitol steps to call for the 
House to take up our bill and make 
right this injustice. No individual de-
serves the indignity of suffering alone. 
We can fix this, and we must. 
May God bless all of those who suf-
fered and all of those essential care-
givers around our Nation. We are 
grateful to you. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Washington, D.C.

request of the majority of the members of 
the Committee.

conducted by the Committee, shall make 
public announcement of the date, place and 
subject matter of any hearing to be con-
ducted on any measure or matter at least 
one week before the commencement of that 
hearing unless the Committee determines 
that there is good cause to begin such hear-
ing at an earlier date. In the latter event, 
the Chair shall make such public announce-
ment at the earliest possible date. The staff 
director of the Committee shall promptly 
notify the Daily Digest of the Congressional 
Record as soon as possible after such public 
announcement is made.

pearing before the Committee shall file ad-

bers to receive appropriate consideration.

for questioning of witnesses by all members, 
including minority Members and the rule of 
germaneness shall be enforced in all hearings 
notified.

poration or entity furnishing the same, be 
maintained in strict confidence by the mem-
bers and staff of the Committee, except that

the release thereof is effected in a manner 
which will not reveal the identity of such in-
dividual, partnership, corporation or entity

tial to the performance of the functions of

public or transmitted to the Congress with-
out the approval of a majority of the Com-
mittee except when Congress has adjourned:

may make a report supplementary to or dis-
senting from the majority report. Such sup-
plementary or dissenting reports should be 
as brief as possible. 
(b) Factual reports by the Committee staff 
may be printed for distribution to Com-
mittee members and the public only upon 
authorization of the Chair either with the 
approval of a majority of the Committee or

ment of conclusions concerning any inves-
tigation shall be made by a member of the

RULE 15.—COMMITTEE STAFF

the matters to be discussed or the testimony

(2) the information has been obtained by 
the Government on a confidential basis, 
other than through an application by such 
person for a specific Government financial or

cret in order to prevent undue injury to the

amendment by each member of the com-
mittee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of rule XXVI 
of the Standing Rules.) 
4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all 
measures and matters before the committee. 
However, the vote of the committee to re-
port a measure or matters shall require the 
concurrence of a majority of the members of 
the committee who are physically present at 
the time of the vote. Proxies will be allowed 
in such cases solely for the purpose of re-
cording a member’s position on the question 
and then only in those instances when the

HONORING MRS. MILDRED MAE 
DUKE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mrs. Mildred Mae Duke for more than 
35 years of dedicated service as a federal em-
ployee. 
Mrs. Duke is the third child of seven. She 
was born and raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, 
where she and her husband, Mr. Summer 
Isaac Duke, reside today. They have one son, 
Jon Maxwell ‘‘Max’’ Duke. 
Mrs. Duke attended St. Michael’s Catholic 
School from grades 1 through 6, and later at-
tended Biloxi High School, where she grad-
uated in 1974. Mrs. Duke’s father, Mr. John 
Wallace Toche, served in the United States 
Army during the Korean War. As the daughter 
of a Korean War veteran, Mrs. Duke has al-
ways held a deep appreciation for our military. 
Mrs. Duke’s federal civil service began as 
an employee at the Pearl Harbor Navy Base 
in Honolulu, Hawaii from 1985 to 1986. Her 
first position was the Administration Assistant 
for the Officer-in-Charge Industrial Hygienist 
Office. Mrs. Duke’s drive and determination 
quickly became apparent. She was promoted 
in November 1986 to Administrative Assistant 
at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, at the 15th 
Supply Squadron until May 1993. 
After leaving Pearl Harbor, she traveled to 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where she worked 
as Executive Assistant to the Director of De-
fense Intelligence Agency at the American 
Embassy from August 1994 until August 1996. 
After returning from overseas to her home-
town, she was hired as the secretary to the 
Military 
Personnel 
Flight 
Commander 
at 
Keesler Air Force Base from July 2002 until 
January 2007. Since 2013, she has served as 
Executive Assistant/Protocol Manager to the 
Commanding Officer at the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
Throughout Mrs. Duke’s career, she has re-
ceived 2 Civilian of the Year Awards, 2 Civil-
ian of the Quarter Awards, 21 Exceptional 
Performance Awards, 2 Special Act Awards 
and a Civilian Meritorious Service Award. Mrs. 
Duke will be retiring this year, after over 35 
years of dedication to the state of Mississippi 
and our great Nation. On behalf of the 4th 
Congressional District, we wish her the best.

REMEMBERING MILTON P. MOORE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful to remember a great 
South Carolinian, Milton P. Moore. Milton was 
always involved in his community through his 
service in the South Carolina National Guard 
and as an adjunct professor at the University 
of South Carolina. He was vital in the develop-
ment of the modern Republican Party of South 
Carolina and much of its success is credited 
to him with the largest Republican majorities in 
140 years. 
At the Eastminster Presbyterian Church 
services, the Reverend Doctor Benjamin Sloan 
and the Reverend Doctor Bradley Smith elo-
quently cited Milton Moore as a person who 
loved people. My wife Roxanne and I were ap-
preciative 
being 
with 
Governor 
Henry 
McMaster, First Lady Peggy McMaster, Attor-
ney General Alan Wilson, State Representa-
tive Chip Huggins, and Republican State 
Chairman Drew McKissick. 
MILTON P. MOORE 
DECEMBER 3, 1943–JUNE 22, 2021 
COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA.—Milton Perry 
Moore was born December 3, 1943 in Clinton, 
South Carolina to Wilma McCracken Moore 
and Perry Martin Moore. His father was a 
farmer and his mother owned and operated a 
loan office. She was one of very few women 
in business in her day. Growing up in Clin-
ton, an idyllic, southern mill town, shaped 
his life. He and his wife Jean attended Clin-
ton schools, from Kindergarten through 
graduating together from Clinton High in 
the Class of 1962. After High School he at-
tended Oak Ridge Military Academy in Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee. He was a graduate of 
Wofford College in the Class of 1967. He 
moved his young family to Columbia in 1972 
to attend Graduate School at the University 
of South Carolina. Jean supported the family 
as Resident Manager of Hampton Park 
Apartments. Milton earned a Master’s De-
gree in Business Administration and a Mas-
ter’s Degree in Accountancy. Many years 
later he was an Adjunct Professor of Finance 
and Taxation at the University of South 
Carolina. He served in the South Carolina 
National Guard as a Military Police officer. 
He was a member of Ducks Unlimited, the 
Columbia Rotary Club (Paul Harris Fellow), 
the Irmo Navy, and was a pioneer in the de-
velopment and success of the modern day Re-
publican Party in South Carolina. He led 
many highly successful fundraising efforts 
for candidates statewide from the early days. 
He was a head Usher at Eastminster Pres-
byterian Church for more than twenty years. 
He grew up water skiing on Lake Green-
wood and then Lake Murray, where he built 
the Moore family Jake home in 1980. He en-
joyed duck hunting with friends and ulti-
mately his sons. He floated almost every 
river in South Carolina. He taught his sons, 
among many other things, about shotguns, 
tractors, boats and motors. He was ex-
tremely proud of his daughter and her com-
mitment to succeed him in his business. He 
could and would fix or build most anything. 
He studied the South and wrote the family 
book on our Scottish heritage. He was gifted 
as an inspirational public speaker and teach-
er of life. He possessed a quick wit. He loved 
Bluegrass, Country and Gospel music. He 
threw a little Fourth of July party at Lake 
Murray every now and then. He was meticu-
lous, had an unrivaled positive attitude, end-
less motivation and energy. He had a special 
heart. He was the compass of our family. He 
guided us to the rivers, lakes, the ocean, 
churches and most importantly our family. 
He will be missed every day. 
He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Jean 
Bailey 
Arnold; 
children, 
Martin 
Arnold 
Moore (Lauri), Meredith Moore Housman 
(Gary), Matthew McCracken Moore; grand-
children, Ross Martin Moore, John Bailey 
Moore, 
Lyndsay 
Meredith 
Moore, 
Adlai 
Vassy Moore, Langston Emory Moore, Lou-
isa Perry Moore, Reese Woodruff Housman 
and Riley Kathryn Housman. 
The memorial service for Mr. Moore will be 
held at 11 o’clock, Friday, June 25, 2021 at 
Eastminster 
Presbyterian 
Church, 
3200 
Trenholm Road, Columbia, S.C. A visitation 
will be held in Thompson Hall immediately 
following the service, and from 5 until 7 
o’clock 
at 
Lake 
Murray 
Presbyterian 
Church, 2721 Dutch Fork Road, Chapin, S.C. 
A livestream of the service may be seen by 
visiting eastminsterpres.org. 
At a later date, Milton will be buried in 
Bethesda Cemetery in York County. Genera-
tions of Moores have been laid to rest in this 
special place since their arrival in South 
Carolina in the 1700s. 
Donations in his memory may be made to 
Eastminster Presbyterian Church; Hammond 
School, 854 Galway Lane, Columbia, SC 29209; 
Lake Murray Presbyterian Church; or the 
Animal Mission of Columbia, P.O. Box 50023,

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION 
FOR THE FUTURE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of legislation reauthor-
izing funding for the National Science Founda-
tion, HR 2225, the National Science Founda-
tion for the Future Act. 
I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for 
their leadership and hard work to put together 
this package. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of 
this bill to increase much-needed NSF funding 
while implementing new and creative strate-
gies to improve STEM education and bolster 
our research and engineering infrastructure. 
The NSF is a funder of more than 1800 in-
stitutions in the US. Given that a quarter of all 
federal funding is contributed through the 
Foundation, nearly every student in STEM has 
been in one way or another supported by the 
NSF through grants, fellowships, and research 
opportunities. 
Despite continuing support from Congress, 
the reality is that the majority of grant pro-
posals NSF receives are rejected and valuable 
research projects are never carried out. 
During an era of tough global competition in 
the science and technology sector, it is so im-
portant that we find effective ways to boost 
scientific advancements and keep up with a 
quickly changing world. 
This bill would authorize increased funding 
for the next five years, setting our students

and institutions on a sure path to more suc-
cessful American innovation. 
In addition to these funding increases, my 
Science, Space, and Technology colleagues 
and I have identified important areas of inter-
est that are addressed through new NSF pro-
grams and policies to better support our re-
search efforts. Among others, this legislation 
finds creative ways to boost STEM education 
from PreK–12 education all the way through 
graduate school. 
I am glad that this bill includes an amend-
ment I introduced in committee to give emerg-
ing minority-serving institutions access to NSF 
funding through a merit-based process, to help 
them build their research capacity and help 
expose diverse student populations to STEM 
careers. 
Though our STEM workforce is some of the 
most well-equipped in the world, our institu-
tions continue to report drastically low num-
bers in workplace diversity. 
Only one in 10 STEM workers are underrep-
resented people of color, a statistic that does 
not come close to the racial makeup of the 
United States. 
These racial imbalances will not just go 
away with time. We must put forward serious 
and concrete solutions to ensure students of 
color have the same opportunities as their fel-
low peers to pursue their ambitions. 
By directly funding these MSls, which in-
cludes HBCUs, tribal colleges, Hispanic-serv-
ing institutions, and even some community 
colleges, we can expand their research capa-
bilities and offer people of color more opportu-
nities for a career in science and engineering. 
Other efforts that I authored which are in-
cluded in this package include helping ensure 
NSF funding is helping support critical and 
groundbreaking water research that can help 
address local and global water challenges, an 
effort I authored to help ensure that commu-
nity colleges, which often serve diverse com-
munities, can also better engage with the 
NSF, and finally, an effort, with Rep. YOUNG 
KIM, to address K–8 STEM education in our 
secondary schools. The earlier we can hook 
kids in STEM, the better. 
This is a good bill and I urge my colleagues 
to support it.

RECOGNIZING 
LIEUTENANT 
GEN-
ERAL BRIAN D. BEAUDREAULT, 
UNITED STATES MARINE 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Gen-
eral Brian David Beaudreault, United States 
Marine Corps, for his service to our great Na-
tion and his family’s faithful service as well. 
The theme of his distinguished career has 
been one of achievement with highest honors 
throughout his 38 years of unconditional serv-
ice to the United States of America. 
Lieutenant General Beaudreault is a sec-
ond-generation 
Marine—his 
father, 
Rene, 
served in the Marine Corps in World War II. 
He was commissioned as a Second Lieuten-
ant in 1983 after graduating from the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts-Amherst. In his 38 years 
as a Marine Infantry Officer, he has com-
manded at every level from the platoon to the 
Marine Expeditionary Force. 
Over the course of his career, Lieutenant 
General Beaudreault has deployed in support 
of military operations in Somalia, East Timer, 
Iraq, and Pakistan. Notably, while in command 
of 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Iraq, his 
masterful leadership in combat helped change 
the balance of power in Al Anbar Province and 
accelerate the multi-national force’s successful 
counterinsurgency fight. In various higher 
headquarters staff positions, including his time 
as the Marine Corps’ Deputy Commandant for 
Plans, Policies, and Operations, Lieutenant 
General Beaudreault significantly impacted the 
Nation’s military readiness to face challenges 
around the globe. We are all safer due to his 
selflessness and dedication. 
Lieutenant General Beaudreault’s final tour 
in the Marine Corps is as the Commanding 
General, II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), 
based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. It is 
no easy task to command and care for over 
40,000 Marines, Sailors, and their families, but 
Lieutenant General and Mrs. Beaudreault 
have excelled at it. During his time in com-
mand, II MEF has deployed forces in support 
of every Geographic Combatant Commander, 
achieved greater naval integration, and im-
proved the MEF’s readiness as a warfighting 
headquarters. Much of this occurred while II 
MEF was simultaneously dealing with the 
challenges of the COVID–19 pandemic. Lieu-
tenant General Beaudreault’s leadership dur-
ing these challenging times is just one more 
example of the type of Marine that he is—one 
of the very best. 
Over his years of faithful service, Lieutenant 
General Beaudreault has earned the Defense 
Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, 
and the Bronze Star, among other awards. 
Lieutenant General Beaudreault has served 
38 outstanding years in support of our beloved 
Nation and will retire on 8 July 2021. I am de-
lighted to have this opportunity to recognize 
not only Lieutenant General Beaudreault, but 
his entire family for their undeniably incredible 
service to the U.S. Marine Corps and our 
great nation. Their sacrifice and dedication to 
our nation is truly remarkable. I wish him and 
his beloved wife, Karen, well as they embark 
on a new chapter in their lives. God bless the 
Beaudreaults, God bless the United States of 
America, and Semper Fidelis.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF DARLENE 
TALLENT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember one of my constituents, Mrs. 
Darlene Agnes Tallent, of Chiltons, Virginia. 
Mrs. Tallent passed away on Tuesday, Jan-
uary 19, 2021 at the age of 74. Darlene was 
born and raised in Westmoreland County. She 
married her high school sweetheart, Joe 
Tallent, and together they raised their two 
daughters Kathleen and Lisa in Montross 
County. 
Darlene spent her career working as the 
Westmoreland County Museum’s Genealogical 
Library Assistant. She assisted countless re-
searchers, authors and visitors in her 25 years 
of employment by sharing her extensive 
knowledge on the history of Westmoreland 
County and helping others trace their heritage 
and connect with who and where they came 
from. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
join me in honoring the life of Mrs. Darlene 
Tallent, and applauding her contributions to 
Westmoreland County and the Common-
wealth. On behalf of America’s First District, 
we say thank you.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. KENNETH 
H. COOPER 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kenneth H. Cooper, MD, 
MPH, Founder and Chairman of the Cooper 
Aerobics Center. Dr. Cooper turned 90 years- 
old on March 4, 2021 and is a life-long exem-
plary example for maintaining a healthy life-
style. Having logged more than 38,000 miles 
running, he can often be found exercising with 
his wife, Millie, at the Cooper Aerobics Center. 
It is my privilege to commend him for his tre-
mendous role in inspiring millions of people to 
exercise for their physical and mental good 
health over the course of his trailblazing 64- 
year medical career. 
Dr. Cooper served 13 years in the U.S. 
Army and U.S. Air Force, as a flight surgeon 
and director of the Aerospace Medical Labora-
tory. During his service, he developed the 12- 
minute and 1.5-mile fitness tests and the Aer-
obics Point System, used today by branches 
of the military, schools and organizations 
worldwide. In 1968, Dr. Cooper wrote his best-
seller, Aerobics, where he coined a new word 
and submitted the official definition to the Ox-
ford English Dictionary. In addition to Aero-
bics, Dr. Cooper has authored 18 additional 
books which have sold over 30 million copies 
and been translated into 41 languages and 
Braille. After retiring from military service in 
1970, Dr. Cooper founded the Cooper Aero-
bics Center in Dallas, TX with the mission to 
explore 
the 
relationship 
between 
cardio-
vascular fitness, health and longevity. 
Dr. Cooper’s oratory skills have echoed in 
halls across the county and internationally in 
more than 50 countries. He attained iconic 
status in Brazil, having trained the 1970 Bra-
zilian soccer team leading to their World Cup 
victory. In Portuguese, jogging is translated as 
‘‘coopering’’. In Hungary, the national fitness 
test is named the ‘‘cooperteszt’’, In April 2013, 
Dr. Cooper attended the prestigious Boao 
Forum in China, serving as a forum panelist 
alongside a former Prime Minister of Australia 
and two Nobel Prize Laureates in Medicine. 
I appreciate Dr. Cooper for his extraordinary 
pioneering efforts to improve the lives of 
Americans by positively impacting our diet. His 
collaboration with PepsiCo and their elimi-
nation of trans fats from its Frito-Lay snack 
line set an international example that other 
companies follow. For three years, the back of 
Baked Lays packages included this quote from 
Dr. Cooper, ‘‘Fitness is a journey, not a des-
tination. It must be continued for the rest of 
your life.’’

HONORING WIAWAKA CENTER FOR 
WOMEN 
FOR 
THE 
COMPLETED 
RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF 
TRIX 
AND 
THEIR 
IMPACT 
ON 
THE LAKE GEORGE COMMUNITY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Wiawaka Center for 
Women on their successful restoration of the 
House of Trix, one of the many buildings used 
by the retreat, and a historic landmark located 
on Lake George in New York. 
The Wiawaka Center for Women has an im-
portant role in our community as a place of 
rest, rejuvenation, and support for women 
throughout the North Country and the entire 
United States of America. The center, founded 
by Mary Fuller in 1903, is on the National 
Registry of Historic Places and has been a 
place of retreat for generations of women. 
Wiawaka is the oldest and longest continu-
ously operating site of its kind in the United 
States. The center has previously hosted the 
likes of Georgia O’Keefe, renowned American 
artist, and has a rich history of supporting and 
encouraging women in their fight for equal 
rights. 
In renovating and restoring the historic 
House of Trix, Wiawaka continues to invest in 
and pursue their mission of providing a place 
of retreat for all women. This is the only build-
ing within the center that hosts a variety of 
programming 
including 
art 
workshops, 
wellness classes, presentations, and events. 
Through perseverance, teamwork, and with 
support of the community, they restored this 
historic building back to its original splendor 
and purpose. After receiving funding through a 
grant by the Alfred Z. Solomon Charitable 
Trust, Wiawaka will be able to continue their 
important work of serving the community of 
women around them. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank the Wiawaka Center for 
Women, and their entire team, for their dedi-
cation and commitment in revitalizing and re-
storing a deeply important historic property in 
our community. I congratulate them on their 
achievements thus far and the continued ac-
complishments of the women this center 
serves. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CHRISTOPHER YOCK 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Christopher 
Yock, who passed away on June 8, 2021 at 
the age of 57 after battling a structure fire at 
San Francisco International Airport. He was a 
beloved member of the San Rafael community 
and a San Francisco firefighter. 
Christopher was born on December 27, 
1963 in San Francisco and was raised in the 
Westborough neighborhood of South San 
Francisco. Christopher began his journey in 
the fire service as a firefighter at the Alameda 
Naval Airbase Station and the Presidio Fire 
Department before finally achieving his dream 
of becoming a firefighter for the San Francisco 
Fire Department. Christopher loved his career 
in the fire service, and was a beloved fire-
house chef who prepared amazing meals for 
his fellow firefighters. 
Christopher lived a full and vibrant life, 
meeting and making lifelong friends along the 
way. He had a passion for traveling, cooking, 
photography, and music. Christopher was a 
seasoned world traveler, with some of his fa-
vorite 
destinations 
being 
Palau, 
Porto, 
Maldives, Tahiti, Bali and numerous family 
trips to Maui. Christopher is survived by his 
siblings, Jeffery Yock and Jennifer Yock- 
Lanthier, his son, Cayden Yock (Nancy 
Galvin), his brother-in-law, Sean Lanthier, and 
his nephew and nieces, Danielle Gracia, 
Alyssa Sozio, Adam Lanthier, and Ashley 
Yock. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending condolences to Chris-
topher’s family and friends and in expressing 
our deep appreciation for his dedicated serv-
ice to public safety and the San Francisco Fire 
Department.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BARRY 
WILLIAMS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to observe and mourn the passing of 
Barry Williams, a local civic champion who 
dedicated his life to bringing people together 
and who tirelessly advocated for social justice, 
the middle class, and the everyday working 
man and woman. Sadly, on May 2nd of this 
year—Barry passed away at the age of 71 
after a tough 17–year battle with Parkinson’s 
disease. Barry’s inspirational life, however, will 
never dissipate from our community’s collec-
tive spirit as he treated everyone he encoun-
tered with love and humility, setting an immor-
talized example for us all to aspire to. 
Born in in 1949 in York, Maine—Barry and 
his family relocated to Waterford, Connecticut 
where Barry grew up and acquired his love for 
the coastline. Barry would spend many hours 
of his life enjoying the beach, fishing, or sail-
ing, and was invigorated when he caught a 
fish, which wasn’t often. Barry was an avid 
reader and eventually made a career of his 
love for books by attaining a degree at the 
University of Connecticut in Library Science 
then even returning to work for his alma mater 
as an acquisitions librarian. 
While working as a librarian, Barry was also 
an active member of the American Federation 
of Teachers (AFT local union and even 
worked his way up to become President of his 
local. Being elected to lead his union truly 
changed Barry and ignited a passion in him 
that he used to champion workers’ rights 
throughout his life. While president of the 
union, Barry was admired for his ability to fight 
for his members but still maintain a loving and 
friendly personality and always face chal-
lenges with a positive attitude. Barry’s accom-
plishments and dedication to his union gained 
him statewide notoriety and led to him being 
recruited as a Government Affairs Representa-
tive by Connecticut statewide AFT President 
George Springer. Hitting the ground running— 
Barry made his mark and inspired all those 
around him with his willingness to put others 
before himself. Not only did Barry talk the talk 
but he was always out on the front lines with 
his brothers and sisters rallying for their right 
to equal opportunities and fairness in the 
workplace. Achieving milestone after mile-
stone—Barry set himself apart as one of the 
top labor leaders in Connecticut and this led to 
his election in 1985 to represent all workers in 
the state as the Secretary Treasurer of the 
Connecticut AFL–CIO. 
Now a true and tried advocate in the world 
of unions, Barry decided to go independent 
and start his own lobbying firm to represent 
unions and non-profits in 1987. With all the 
statewide connections he had developed in his 
decades of organizing and union work—Barry 
quickly gained traction as someone who could 
bring opposing sides to the table to talk, and 
he also became known for a little secret weap-
on in breaking the ice between opposing 
forces—his famous homemade bread. Barry 
was truly a master negotiator because he 
never lamented, and his genuine and happy 
nature rubbed off on all those around him 
which made coming to agreements easier for 
all parties. Barry continued a very successful 
lobbying career until later in life when he 
would receive a devastating diagnosis with 
Parkinson’s disease which would lead to his 
retirement. Barry however as expected, did 
not let the disease damper his love for life and 
for bringing happiness to all those around him. 
Even when he was in the later stages of his 
life in the Hebrew Center for Health and Reha-
bilitation in West Hartford—his positive de-
meanor gained him the nickname, ‘‘the 
Mayor,’’ as he was so loved by his fellow resi-
dents and staff. Even up until his last Christ-
mas, Barry grew out his beard to transform 
himself into Santa to pass out small gifts and 
candy to fellow residents. 
Madam Speaker, the loss of Barry leaves a 
deep void in Connecticut as he was a unifier 
who brought people of both sides of the aisle 
together. I ask that my colleagues and this 
Chamber to join me in expressing our deepest 
respect for Barry’s work and life and send our 
deepest condolences to the Williams Family. 
Barry is survived by his wife Susan, children 
Colby, Jake, Sam, Patel, his sisters Sedona 
and Kathi, and many other family members 
and friends who will carry the lasting memory 
of Barry in their hearts so that his joy, laugh-
ter, and compassion will continue to carry on.

SUPPORTING INVEST IN AMERICA 
ACT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of the INVEST in America Act, 
which will create good paying jobs to rebuild 
and re-imagine America’s surface transpor-
tation infrastructure by revitalizing our existing 
roads and bridges and making investments in 
passenger rail, public transit, cycling and walk-
ing infrastructure, and zero-emission options— 
while creating safer, more connected commu-
nities. 
After decades of disinvestment and four 
years of failed ‘Infrastructure Weeks,’ I believe 
that now is the time to make desperately 
needed investments to rebuild our nation. 
According to the 2021 Report Card for 
America’s Infrastructure assessment by the 
American Society of Civil Engineers, our na-
tion’s infrastructure receives the grade: C-. A 
continued underinvestment in our infrastruc-
ture at current rates will cost $10 trillion in 
GDP, more than $3 million jobs, and $2.4 tril-
lion in exports over the next 20 years. 
We cannot wait. It is time to invest, re-
imagine, and revitalize a new American econ-
omy by building the architecture of our na-
tion’s future. We need transformative plans 
like the INVEST in America Act and the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan, a once-in-a-century capital in-
vestment in America that will create millions of 
good-paying-jobs and rebuild our country’s in-
frastructure, including high-speed rail. 
We need to recognize the importance of in-
vesting in high-speed rail. And I will continue 
working for more rail investment and ensure 
that federal dollars fund high-speed rail 
projects 
across 
this 
country—including 
projects in Connecticut, which total almost 
$10B in CT’s new initiative, TIME FOR CT 
and along the Northeast Corridor which cur-
rently has $117B of needed investment 
through their project titled CONNECT2035 and 
New Haven’s Downtown Crossing, which I 
was proud to help secure $20 million for New 
Haven to reconnect its downtown with both 
the outlying neighborhoods and the train sta-
tion—helping the local business community 
flourish. 
We can make opportunity real for millions 
with good-paying jobs. And, we can strength-
en our economy. So, let us move boldly. And 
let us start rebuilding America.

IN HONOR OF RUSS POPPE 
HON. DAN CRENSHAW 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank and honor a true public serv-
ant, the Executive Director of the Harris Coun-
ty Flood Control District, Russ Poppe. 
Russ is stepping down on July 2, 2021. Dur-
ing his five-year tenure as Executive Director, 
Russ made a lasting and significant impact to 
reduce the threat of flooding in Harris County. 
Russ’s time at the Flood Control District was 
spent building solid relationships at the local, 
state, and federal levels. Russ’s excellent net-
work of contacts is partly responsible for the 
Flood Control District bringing in over one bil-
lion dollars in federal grants in the past few 
years. He has earned the trust of various 
agencies including the U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers, the Natural Resources Conservation 
Services, and Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency. 
Russ led the Flood Control District through 
the worst rainfall event in American history, 
Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In the aftermath of 
Harvey, Russ helped former County Judge Ed 
Emmett pass the historic $2.5 billion Harris 
County Flood Bond in August 2018. After vot-
ers approved the bond program, Russ became 
the head of a multi-billion-dollar enterprise, all 
with the purpose of helping his community in 
Harris County. 
Since that time, under Russ’s leadership, 
the Flood Control District has started over 200 
flood damage reduction projects and has in-
creased project delivery volume over ten 
times. 
Russ’s leadership and professionalism will 
be missed at the Flood Control District. Russ 
always practiced leadership by inspiration, not 
intimidation. Russ and his staff have spent 
countless hours working with my staff and me 
to ensure we understand the tremendous chal-
lenges the Harris County area faces when it 
comes to reducing flooding. 
I wish to thank him for his service and wish 
him all the best. I am certain that he will con-
tinue his success at the next stop on his ca-
reer journey.

RECOGNIZING JOEL GOMEZ AS MY 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize Encinitas na-
tive Joel Gomez for my June Constituent of 
the Month. Recent graduate of Classical Acad-
emy High, Joel Gomez has not only rep-
resented California’s 49th Congressional Dis-
trict around the country with his impressive 
athletic ability, but also the United States on 
the world stage as a medal award-winning 
Paralympic athlete. A member of the United 
States Paralympic Track and Field team, Joel 
has competed with great success in Switzer-
land, Peru and Dubai, earning two gold med-
als and one silver medal in the 1500 meters 
and 400 meters events. On top of that, Joel 
was named the 2019 Male Junior Para Athlete 
of the Year by USA Track & Field. 
Still just 17 years old, Joel is currently pre-
paring to represent the United States as a 
member of Team USA once again at the 
Tokyo Paralympics. Although the COVID–19 
pandemic put a hold on much of the athletic 
communities’ plans, Joel remained positive in 
his training and competition efforts, a perse-
verance he is no stranger to. With the post-
ponement of the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics and 
Olympics, Joel had the opportunity to train, 
stay motivated, and work harder than ever for 
what he hopes will soon be the pinnacle of his 
running career upon successful qualification at 
the U.S. Paralympic Team Trials. 
In addition to his athletic achievements, Joel 
is an accomplished student, and is set to at-
tend Purdue University this fall, where he in-
tends to study industrial engineering. He also 
plays 4 instruments and sings, and in 2017, 
he made it to the finals in the Boys and Girls 
Club of Southwest County Idol Season 8. I’m 
honored to represent such an impressive 
young man, and I’m eager to watch and cheer 
him on as he races on the behalf of Team 
USA. Competing at an international level is an 
incredible feat, especially at such a young 
age, and I am proud to stand behind this re-
markable, well-rounded young man, who I’m 
pleased to recognize as my June Constituent 
of the Month.

IN RECOGNITION OF FORMER REP-
RESENTATIVE PAUL MITCHELL 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of my friend and col-
league, Representative Paul Mitchell, who re-
tired after proudly serving his constituents 
from Michigan’s 10th Congressional District. 
Paul was recently diagnosed with stage IV 
renal cancer and after great medical treatment 
is on his way to a continued recovery. While 
my heart hurts for his family, I am optimistic 
Paul will pull through. He has shown us time 
and time again that he is not only a man of 
principle, but also a fighter. 
I first met Paul when we came in the same 
class after being elected in 2016. We served 
together on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee and we shared the same hallway in the 
Cannon House Office Building. Serving on the 
House Armed Services Committee, we had 
the opportunity to travel and visit troops in 
Germany and the Middle East, and build our 
friendship. I continued to work with Paul as we 
also served together on the House Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee. Through-
out the years, I got to know Paul’s humor and 
his dedication towards service. 
While Paul and I did not always agree on 
policy, I always knew that I could have a can-
did discussion with my friend. Our conversa-
tions were cordial and with a shared goal of 
improving the lives of the American people 
and upholding our democracy. 
In order to achieve these goals, Paul was 
not afraid to cross party lines. During his last 
term, Paul showed incredible courage in 
standing up for our democracy and supporting 
the 2020 election results. 
It is with this same courage that I know Paul 
will use to fight this disease. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in thanking former Rep-
resentative Paul Mitchell for his leadership and 
service to our country and his constituents. 
As Paul begins his treatment, I want to send 
him my best. I look forward to the day when 
we can celebrate Paul’s remission.

CBC SUPPORTS INVESTING IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 28, 2021 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
discuss the importance of infrastructure to my 
district and the Nation. Right now, we are dis-
cussing two monumental transportation and in-
frastructure improvement proposals: the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan and the INVEST in America 
Act. Both proposals would repair and replace 
airports, bridges, buses, seaports, and thou-
sands of miles of American highways. 
These proposals would provide direct bene-
fits to my constituents in New Jersey’s 10th 
District. The greatest benefit would be the 
construction of the $13.4 billion Gateway Pro-
gram. The program consists of two projects: a 
new Portal North Bridge and a new Hudson 
River Tunnel to go with repairs to the current 
tunnel. The existing bridge and tunnels are 
more than 110 years old. They have been 
here longer than the Empire State Building 
and they are an accident waiting to happen. 
Each facility carries 200,000 passengers in 
450 trains every day to destinations in New 
Jersey, New York and across the country. A 
shut down of either facility would cost $100 
million in lost economic output every day. 
Thankfully, officials will begin construction on 
the new Portal North Bridge this year. But we 
need funding for the Hudson River Tunnel 
project immediately. 
The Gateway Program is not the only infra-
structure project that would receive aid from 
these bills. A strong investment in our nation’s 
infrastructure will help the City of East Orange 
improve their transit network and revitalize 
their downtown area. It will provide more ad-
vanced vehicle and pedestrian crossing sig-
nals to increase the speed and safety of traffic 
in Newark. It will replace sidewalks and 
streetscapes in South Orange. In addition, it 
will give the residents of Bloomfield a modern 
train station. 
These projects are all critical to the eco-
nomic health and prosperity of my residents. I 
know each Member of Congress has a similar 
list of projects that will bring similar benefits to 
their constituents. We cannot wait any longer. 
The longer we wait, the farther behind our na-
tional transportation system falls in relation to 
countries in Europe and Asia. We need to 
support these bills, repair our bridges, repave 
our roads, and make life better for all Ameri-
cans. It is the job we were elected to do. Now, 
it is time to do it.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
DAVID WARD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today to honor the 
life of the late John David Ward, of Vernon, 
Connecticut, who passed away surrounded by 
family on March 17, 2021, at the age of 59. As 
someone who has shared a hometown with 
John, practiced law in the same courts, and 
witnessed his public service firsthand, I can at-
test to his intelligence, compassion and integ-
rity in all his endeavors. 
Born to William and Mary Durkin Ward in 
Holyoke, Massachusetts, John was raised and 
educated in East Longmeadow, Massachu-
setts where he graduated high school in 1980. 
As one who always placed value on edu-
cation—John went on to earn a bachelor’s de-
gree from the University of Massachusetts, 
Amherst before obtaining his J.D. in 1991 from 
Western 
New 
England 
University’s 
Law 
School. Equipped with a law degree, John 
quickly transitioned his Massachusetts-based 
education to start his career as an assistant 
clerk at the Rockville Superior Court. After 
some experience in the courthouse and brief 
stints with several law firms, John ultimately 
found a place at Liberty Mutual, where his 
specialties included labor relations and work-
er’s compensation law. Having gained his full 
footing in a career that enabled his specialties 
to excel, John settled here in Vernon and we 
became neighbors. As I mentioned earlier, I 
handled cases in the same courts as John, 
and he was a talented, highly ethical profes-
sional who treated clients, fellow lawyers and 
court officials as consummate gentleman and 
advocate. 
As a resident of Vernon, John developed 
the roots for his greatest passion: community 
service. This was exemplified early on when 
he was first elected to the Board of Education 
and then to Vernon’s Town Council. In 2008, 
John even decided to leave the insurance 
business to pursue this passion of community 
service by working in local government as the 
Town Administrator for Vernon, serving in this 
role over the course of three mayoral adminis-
trations. During his tenure as Town Adminis-
trator, John directed renovations of the old 
mills and secured a new senior center for our 
neighboring residents. In 2011, John placed 
himself on the front lines of emergency service 
in Vernon when Connecticut was hit with the 
‘‘Snowtober’’ nor’easter. Outside working for 
the town in a more official capacity, he often 
volunteered as a ‘‘pit parent’’ for the high 
school marching band. In fact, he coached 
and help raised Vernon’s youngest generation 
through numerous youth sports including bas-
ketball, soccer and football. 
It is worth noting that John’s love for public 
service stayed with him into his latest years. In 
2017, John made the switch to serve as the 
Town Manager in Granby, Connecticut where 
he brought the force of his passion for com-
munity service. John also went on to fuse to-
gether his enthusiasm for learning and public 
service, earning a master’s degree in Public 
Administration from the University of Con-
necticut in 2019. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as honorable and impactful as 
John. John’s commitment to our town became 
a part of his life blood, causing him to touch 
the hearts of many in our community. While 
we all mourn the early loss of John, we can 
at least find solace that his story and memory 
live on in others, including his wife of more 
than 25 years, Wendy, and children James, 
Joe, Elizabeth and David. I find it fitting that 
we, the People’s House, honor John’s name 
and character. I ask that the entire House join 
me in recognizing the life of John David Ward, 
never forgetting the importance of serving the 
community.

REMEMBERING SPECIALIST 
JAMESON LINDSKOG 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the life of United States Army Spe-
cialist Jameson Lindskog on the occasion of 
the dedication of a new Army Reserve training 
facility in my district, to his life and heroism. 
Jameson was born on May 25, 1987 in San 
Mateo, California to parents Donna and Curtis. 
He graduated from the Orion Academy in 
2006 and the National Holistic Institute before 
enlisting in the United States Army and be-
came a Certified Emergency Medical Techni-
cian for the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regi-
ment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Air-
borne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. 
While serving as a Platoon Medic on 29 
March 2011, the lead section of his convoy 
was ambushed from multiple directions and 
pinned down. Specialist Lindskog was in the 
trail element and immediately acted to treat 
multiple casualties. The Army describes Spe-
cialist Lindskog’s actions in those moments as 
follows: ‘‘Specialist Lindskog at great personal 
risk to his life showed no hesitation and 
bounded to the wounded Soldiers through 
withering enemy fire while brush, trees, and 
debris were destroyed around him. Once the 
reinforcements reached the ambushed men, 
Specialist Lindskog immediately assessed the 
situation, evaluated casualties, and issued pri-
orities for first aid.’’ 
In the moments that Specialist Lindskog 
was providing life-saving care to his com-
rades, he himself was shot in the chest. Even 
while mortally wounded himself, for thirty min-
utes Specialist Lindskog gave instructions to 
those around him about how to provide emer-
gency care for the wounded soldiers around 
him and himself. His heroism in the throes of 
personal sacrifice saved the lives of two peo-
ple that day. 
Specialist 
Lindskog 
was 
posthumously 
awarded a Silver Star for his conduct, and in 
it’s description the Army states: ‘‘His courage, 
bravery and leadership in combat set the ex-
ample for all to follow. Specialist Lindskog’s 
distinctive accomplishments are in keeping 
with the finest traditions of military service and 
reflect great credit upon himself, the 327th In-
fantry Regiment, the 1st Brigade Combat 
Team, the 101st Airborne Division (Air As-
sault) and the United States Army.’’ 
Today we memorialize Specialist Lindskog’s 
service by naming a new facility at Parks Re-
serve Forces Training Area in his honor. This 
new facility will house six simulation training 
rooms containing hospital beds, simulated pa-
tients, and a host of bio-medical equipment.

The Lindskog Reserve Facility will help pre-
pare the next generation of our heroes to 
serve and save lives in the future. It is a fitting 
tribute to Specialist Lindskog, his parents 
Donna and Matthew Walker and Curtis and Jo 
Lindskog, his siblings Ken and Candace, and 
all those who loved him and hold tight to his

PASSING OF JUSTIN WALLACE 
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Justin Wallace, of Rockaway, New 
York, who was tragically taken from us on 
June 5th. Justin was a blessing to all who 
knew him. An adventurous and loving spirit, 
he brought tremendous joy and laughter into 
the lives of everyone around him. To his fam-
ily, Justin was a ‘‘miracle baby,’’ his very exist-
ence a gift that defied the odds. A curious ex-
plorer with a bright mind, he was always fid-
dling with new gadgets and technology, learn-
ing about cars, enjoying mathematics, and 
playing video games. To our community, he 
was a beacon of hope—a gentle giant with a 
big heart, raised by his loving family to have 
integrity, respect, and to treat others with com-
passion and dignity. 
Justin was taken from us much too soon. 
His family and friends have confronted un-
imaginable grief at the loss of such an inno-
cent and beautiful life. His bright and deter-
mined spirit will be dearly missed. Their hard-
ship reflects what a gift he was to his family 
and friends who had the privilege of loving 
him. As Justin’s brother so eloquently put it: 
‘‘Ten years old was short, but it was a bless-
ing and it was beautiful.’’ 
I pray that God will give strength to the Wal-
lace family as they bear this great personal 
loss. As Scripture tells us in Mathew 11:28– 
30, ‘‘Come to me, all you who are weary and 
burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my 
yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am 
gentle and humble in heart, and you will find 
rest for your souls.’’ 
May God bless his soul.

CELEBRATING 90 YEARS OF 
ELLIOTT’S BAKERY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Elliott’s Bakery located in 
Trenton, Michigan, on the occasion of their 
90th anniversary. Their decades spent as a 
mainstay of the Trenton community is worthy 
of commendation. 
Established in 1931 by Mr. Waldo Elliott, El-
liott’s Bakery has been a Trenton staple for 
nine decades. Mr. Elliott, a Northville, Michi-
gan native, spent 12 years in the bakery busi-
ness before deciding to expand. After consid-
ering six locations, he found Trenton to be the 
perfect home for the new Elliott’s Bakery. At 
the time of its founding, Trenton was a thriving 
residential community in need of a bakery for 
its residents. Elliott’s was exactly what the 
neighborhood needed. The bakery was later 
owned by the Bill and Violetta Vidojevski fam-
ily, who added their own special recipes to the 
menu. 
Despite the changes in ownership, the rec-
ipes and quality of their baked goods have 
maintained their excellence. The current own-
ers, Bradley and Kristine Davidson, have been 
committed to keeping the bakery’s traditional 
recipes alive. Originally, the bakery provided a 
variety of breads and later became well-known 
for their desserts. The bakery’s most popular 
items today include their Long John donuts 
and the raspberry-currant and butter bud 
cookies. Throughout their nine decades in the 
Trenton community, Elliott’s Bakery has main-
tained their reputation for serving up delicious, 
high-quality donuts, cookies, pies, and other 
treats. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 90th anniversary 
of Elliott’s Bakery in Trenton, Michigan. Please 
join me in congratulating Elliott’s Bakery on 
nine fantastic decades of business and in 
wishing them the best of luck in the years to 
come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF HELEN ANDERSON TOLAND 
HON. STEVEN HORSFORD 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Helen 
Anderson Toland. Ms. Toland has been a Las 
Vegas resident since 1964 and served as the 
Clark County School District’s first African 
American female school principle at the former 
Kit Carson Elementary School, now renamed 
Helen Anderson Toland Elementary School in 
her honor. 
Originally from Marceline, Missouri, Ms. 
Toland attended University of Illinois and 
worked as the first black speech correctionist 
in Louisville, Kentucky before receiving a mas-
ter’s degree in speech therapy from University 
of Southern California (USC). While in Los An-
geles in the early 1960s, she became active in 
the NAACP, through which she met Jim An-
derson, whom she married in 1964. 
When Ms. Toland arrived in Las Vegas, she 
was initially hired as a speech therapist by the 
Clark County School District, before becoming 
principal of Kit Carson in 1965, a position she 
held for seven years, after which she became 
principal at Robert E. Lake Elementary 
School. While principal, Ms. Toland took great 
pride in providing for her students, including 
by organizing field trips to Disneyland and Mt. 
Charleston. Following the passing of Mr. An-
derson, she married Elton Toland and moved 
to Los Angeles in 1972 before moving back to 
Las Vegas in 1980. 
Throughout her lifetime, Ms. Toland has 
been very active in community work in Las 
Vegas, as well as in Africa. In addition to her 
work with the NAACP and the civil rights 
movement, Ms. Toland was also a board 
member of an environmental group called 
Foresta, and was involved with the National 
Association of College Women and Les 
Femmes Douze. Ms. Toland is also a member 
of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and was 
one of the founders of the local chapter. Ms. 
Toland also has held community yard sales to 
raise funds for the schooling of young people 
in Las Vegas and Africa, contributed to the 
first preschool speech therapy program in 
Kubwa-Abuja, Nigeria, and shares artwork and 
artifacts from her travels to Africa with mem-
bers of the local community, including univer-
sity and school children. 
Earlier this month, the Historic Preservation 
Commission, joined by Councilman Cedric 
Crear, preserved Ms. Toland’s Westside home 
as part of the City of Las Vegas Historic Prop-
erty Register, and she will be included among 
the icons to be enshrined at Historic Westside 
Legacy Park later this year, in honor of her 
years of accomplishments and dedication to 
the Las Vegas community. We love and ap-
preciate everything Ms. Toland has done for 
the Southern Nevada community, and want to 
take this opportunity to say thank you.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. BOB GOOD 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
was unable to vote on June 29, 2021 due to 
travel arrangements. Had I been present, I 
would have voted as follows: NO on Roll Call 
No. 189; NO on Roll Call No. 190; NO on Roll 
Call No. 191; NO on Roll Call No. 193; YES 
on Roll Call No. 194; NO on Roll Call No. 195; 
and NO on Roll Call No. 196. 
I oppose passage of H.R. 3005 because I 
believe in preserving America’s rich history 
and I support each state’s right to choose 
which two statues they want representing 
them in the U.S. Capitol Building. The Left has 
devoted too much energy to tearing down stat-
ues and monuments, including those of the 
Founders. We should learn from our history, 
not desecrate it. 
I oppose passage of H.R. 2662 because it 
would dangerously expand subpoena power 
so that it could be weaponized against prior 
administration officials, rather than focusing in-
vestigative authority on the current govern-
ment.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 29, 2021 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I was un-
able to vote on June 29, 2021 due to an invi-
tation from the Governor of Texas to travel to 
the border to observe the ongoing crisis that 
is happening there. Had I been present, I 
would have voted as follows: YES on Roll Call 
No. 196. 
I am exceedingly concerned with the Speak-
er’s determination to pass H.R. 3005, To di-
rect the Joint Committee on the Library to re-
place the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the 
Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United

accessible to the public, to remove all statues 
of individuals who voluntarily served the Con-
federate States of America from display in the 
United States Capitol, and for other purposes. 
This bill is Cultural Marxism brought to the 
House floor for a vote. 
This bill attempts to strip individual states of 
their right to choose the statues they are pay-
ing for. In doing so, it seeks to erase their his-
tory—the bad, the good, and everything in be-
tween, that informs whom we’ve been and 
whom we are, as well as where we’ve been, 
so we can aptly navigate where we are going. 
As George Orwell presciently foreshadowed, 
‘‘Every record has been destroyed or falsified, 
every book rewritten, every picture has been 
repainted, every statue and street building has 
been renamed, every date has been altered. 
And the process is continuing day by day and 
minute by minute. History has stopped. Noth-
ing exists except an endless present in which 
the Party is always right.’’ 
But is the Party always right? Surely it is 
not. This point highlights another grievous flaw 
in H.R. 3005. Although it purports to cleanse 
the Capitol complex of Confederate statues 
and busts, in doing so it actually removes only 
Democrat statues and busts. Yes, Democrats 
are removing their Democrat forefathers for 
the sin of their slavery, or other support for the 
Confederacy, committed in times past. 
So why vote YES? Because having fought 
this battle for a state’s right to choose—warn-
ing about the dangers of arbitrarily banishing 
history from our midst—I am sick and tired of 
defending states’ rights so Democrats can try 
to rewrite history and say Republicans are de-
fending racists. We are doing no such thing. In 
fact, I’ve even gone further and tried to get an 
amendment made in order that reveals the 
dirty secret of just how racist, pro-slavery, and 
anti-freedom Democrats have been in the 
past. They want their own statues removed for 
two unspoken reasons: (1) People won’t look 
up their former heroes and find out how racist 
Democrats have been, and (2) A move to 
Marxism requires destruction of history first. If 
people don’t know their nation’s true history, 
they’re more easily duped into accepting a to-
talitarian government. So, if Democrats want 
to remove all Democrat statues and busts in 
the Capitol, I will not stand in their way.
