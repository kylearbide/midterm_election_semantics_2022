Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2020 
No. 204 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
December 3, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

THANKING MY CAMPAIGN TEAM 
AND SUPPORTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, another 
group that I would like to pause and 
thank is my campaign team and sup-
porters. 
It is amazing how diverse this group 
is. They are young and old; they are 
rich and poor; they live in towns, vil-
lages, 
and 
isolated country roads. 
While conservative in ideology, they 
identify as Republicans, Democrats, 
Libertarians, and even Independents. 
These are the people who walked in 
parades; they helped pass out balloons, 
candy, and political literature; they 
carried signs; they put up and took 
down political signs of all sizes; they 
helped stuff mail and phone-bank; they 
organized fundraisers, both big and 
small; they manned booths at county 
fairs. 
What causes people to give up their 
time, their talents and possessions to a 
candidate, party, or cause? It is at the 
heart of a representative democracy, 
our constitutional Republic. 
If someone is going to cast a vote for 
you, shouldn’t you know their beliefs? 
If you feel strongly about an issue, 
wouldn’t you want to help a kindred 
spirit? 
I started to run for Federal office 28 
years ago, unsuccessful then. I was suc-
cessful 4 years later. 
When asked in 1992 what I stood for, 
I replied: 
Less 
government, 
individual 
responsi-
bility, lower taxes, and more personal free-
doms and liberties. 
I followed immediately with: 
I am pro-life, and I support the Second 
Amendment, and I am a churchgoer. 
My volunteers subscribe to these val-
ues. They decided not only to vote for 
me, but they also actively engaged in 
campaign activities. 
Mr. Speaker, one way to thank my 
volunteers and supporters is to list 
their names in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, which I am doing today. They 
are: 
Mayor Al Adomite, Floyd Alexander, 
Kirby Ballard, Sue Barfield, Steve 
Barker, Rhonda Belford, Bill Bethel, 
Ruth 
Buettner, 
Glen 
Bolger, 
Pat 
Brady, Jen Daulby, Rosalee Davis, 
Marty and Donna Davis, Sherri Long 
Deeder, Mayor Dick Dietz, Chris Dud-
ley, Sue (and Jack) Dwyer, Bill Enlow, 
Bruce and Matt Flannigan, The Tony 
Fuhrman Family, Mayor Allen Gaffner, 
Kenny and Joni Garret, Andy Goleman, 
Brad Goodrich, Wally and Evie Gorski, 
Wes and Rene Gozia, Brad Graven.

Mr. Speaker, there is always a risk 
when you recognize people and name 
names. Most of us, when we do that, 
forget someone who should have been 
mentioned. If I have done that, I apolo-
gize. My intent is not to exclude but to 
offer thanks. 
Until I officially leave office, I can 
add 
names 
to 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, so if I have forgotten you, let 
me know and I will submit your name. 
Many of my supporters have died. I 
mourned their loss with their families. 
I tried to attend either the wake or the 
funeral. We also tried to send notes, 
memorials, or flowers, whatever was 
deemed appropriate at the time. 
All of my colleagues here on both 
sides of the aisle share this experience.

H6050 
December 3, 2020 
We would not be here without our sup-
porters. We couldn’t have survived our 
primary or general election without a 
core group of people who believed in us 
and would always answer the call when 
we needed them. 
As long as we have people willing to, 
as Teddy Roosevelt said, step into the 
arena and we have people willing to 
support them, we as a nation will be 
fine. 
My thanks to them, my volunteers 
and supporters. 
f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. HECK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on this floor for the last time. 
My purpose is to convey two simple 
thoughts: first, an expression of grati-
tude, foremost to my wife, Paula—we 
are newlyweds; we have only been mar-
ried 44 years—and to my two sons. 
Their support has been the only reason 
that I have been able to do this. 
I have been absent. I am sorry. I 
promise to do better. 
Thank you as well to my staff. Every 
Member here knows we ain’t nothing 
without them. We are just the orna-
ment on the hood of the car, and they 
are the engine. They have both my un-
dying love and gratitude. 
Thank you to my colleagues. My life 
is enriched, and I am a better person 
for having known you. 
And a very special callout to my 
dear, dear friend, albeit messy room-
mate, and an outstanding legislator, 
DEREK KILMER. 
Last, thank you to the people of the 
10th Congressional District of Wash-
ington, whom I affectionately but sin-
cerely refer to as my bosses. You sent 
me here to represent a newly created 
congressional district. It has truly 
been my privilege. Thank you. 
Second, a plea, a plea to all those 
who follow here: Please, please work to 
nurture this institution. Institutions 
sustain us, be they our houses of wor-
ship for our faith or this secular equiv-
alent for our democracy. They get us 
through hard times, but only if we tend 
to them. 
Citizens in a democracy have, of 
course, 
rights 
and 
responsibilities; 
Members of this institution, this body, 
likewise. We are all too aware of our 
rights here, but it is the responsibil-
ities that bear emphasizing. 
We have a responsibility to conduct 
ourselves in a civil fashion. It is self- 
evident that civic discourse in America 
has degraded; some would say that it 
has even become vulgar. 
You know, it is hard to reach agree-
ment with a colleague tomorrow that 
we have character assassinated today. 
So let us not measure our success in 
terms of the number of Twitter fol-
lowers we have gathered through emo-
tion-charged or clever attacks. Let us 
not define those with whom we dis-
agree, even if that disagreement is pro-
found, as ‘‘the other.’’ 
We live in a pluralistic society. Part 
of our responsibility is to figure out 
how the political Rubik’s Cube comes 
together; getting to ‘‘yes’’ among dif-
ferent and competing points of view; 
fashioning a result where everyone can 
get up from the table, perhaps not with 
everything 
they 
sought, 
but 
with 
enough to vote ‘‘yes’’ while still being 
true to their values. 
There is such a thing as principled 
compromise. Indeed, I believe that 
principled compromise is the only way 
we can move forward and lift up those 
around us in desperate need of our 
help. 
Do we no longer believe that? Or did 
we forget it? 
Where I have failed to live up to 
these ideals, I beg your forgiveness. I 
can only promise to keep trying. 
Finally, I cannot help but think of 
the eternal wisdom of our former col-
league, John Dingell, the longest serv-
ing Member of this Chamber in our Na-
tion’s history. When I arrived here, 
every first-term Member walked on 
down to where he sat and sought his 
advice, and he gave the same to every-
one; the same to everyone. He would 
look us in the eye and say: 
You have an important job—a very impor-
tant job—and you are not a very important 
person. 
Indeed, John taught us that we do 
not possess power, but that we only 
hold it in trust. For the privilege of 
holding the trust for these last 8 years, 
I am forever changed and forever grate-
ful. 
I am 2,300 miles out and headed 
home. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I perma-
nently yield back. 
f 
NONCITIZEN VOTING VIA 1993 NA-
TIONAL 
VOTER 
REGISTRATION 
ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is my fourth speech in a series 
on voter fraud, election theft, and the 
Presidential election. 
For emphasis, the Constitution man-
dates that Congress, not unelected Fed-
eral judges, renders the final verdict on 
who won the 2020 Presidential election. 
Today, I begin addressing systemic 
flaws in America’s election process 
that promote voter fraud and election 
theft, undermine America’s election 
system, and threaten public trust in 
our Republic. 
In America, only citizens are law-
fully allowed to vote and control Amer-
ica’s elections and destiny, yet, deplor-
ably, 
in 
1993, 
Democrats 
rammed 
through Congress the National Voter 
Registration 
Act 
that, 
incredibly, 
makes it illegal—illegal—to require 
proof of citizenship that prevents ille-
gal aliens and noncitizens from reg-
istering to vote. 
Why do Democrats undermine our 
Republic to make illegal alien and non-
citizen voting easier? To win elections, 
of course. 
It is no secret to Democrats or Re-
publicans that, consistent with a 2014 
study by Old Dominion University and 
George Mason University professors, 
noncitizens and illegal aliens vote 80 
percent of the time for Democrats. 
Mr. Speaker, there are many tens of 
millions of illegal aliens and other non-
citizens in America. In 2010, the Census 
found 11 million illegal aliens in Amer-
ica. A 2018 Yale study estimated as 
many as 22 million illegal aliens in 
America. There are simply so many, 
that no one can keep track of how 
many. 
Similarly, no one knows how massive 
the illegal alien voting bloc is or how 
many voted in 2020. Hundreds of thou-
sands? Oh, most certainly. Millions? 
Very likely. 
But what we do know for sure is that 
the illegal alien voting bloc was large 
enough and critical enough to winning 
the Presidential race, that at the Octo-
ber 22 Presidential debate, Joe Biden 
openly and publicly solicited their ille-
gal votes by promising: ‘‘Within 100 
days, I am going to send to the United 
States Congress a pathway to citizen-
ship for over 11 million undocumented 
people.’’ 
Think about that for a moment. A 
Presidential candidate on national TV 
promises amnesty and citizenship to il-
legal aliens in hopes of inspiring them 
to illegally register to vote and vote 
for that candidate. 
If that brazen solicitation of illegal 
voting for up to 22 million illegal 
aliens is not criminal solicitation of 
voter fraud and election theft, it darn 
well ought to be. 
And don’t think for a moment that 
Joe Biden did not know exactly what 
he was doing. After all, on May 11, 1993, 
then Senator Joe Biden personally 
voted for the National Voter Registra-
tion Act that makes it illegal—ille-
gal—to require proof of citizenship 
when illegal aliens and other nonciti-
zens seek to register to vote. 
Mr. Speaker, all Americans deserve 
an election system that stops voter 
fraud, prevents election theft, and ac-
curately records only lawful votes cast 
by eligible American citizens. Unfortu-
nately, America’s election system is so 
riddled with systemic flaws that far 
too many elections are stolen from 
candidates and the American people. 
In my judgment, that is exactly what 
happened in the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion, where the election theft was so 
massive as to favorably compare to 
that old adage: You can’t see the forest 
for the trees. 
Again, in my judgment, if only lawful 
votes cast by eligible American citi-
zens are counted, President Trump 
handily won the electoral college and a 
second term as President. 
As such, it is my duty, under the 
United States Constitution, on Janu-
ary 6, if the required one Senator will 
join me, to object to and later vote to 
reject electoral college vote submis-
sions from States whose election sys-
tems are so badly flawed as to render

ADDRESS THE COVID ISSUE NOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
O’HALLERAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
well, here we are again. The CDC just 
announced that we are going through 
the most difficult time in U.S. public 
health history. Why are we here again? 
Two weeks ago, I asked that this 
body not leave, and we stay until we 
finish up the process of a COVID pack-
age. Today, we are back here again, 
still not having done that, and now 
Christmas is approaching. We will 
probably be leaving here next week, 
hopefully, with a package. But right 
now, that still is an unknown. 
I asked before August the same 
thing, that we not go back for August 
break until we identify a package and 
get it done in a bipartisan way, work-
ing toward protecting the American 
people, protecting families of America, 
protecting American businesses. 
Since then, we now have a projection 
by one of the top groups that have pro-
jected deaths, and they are saying 
350,000 deaths just after Christmas. 
On December 1, 2,760 people died; on 
December 2, 3,157. Those projections 
are identified as increasing because of 
the amount of people hospitalized and 
the percentages historically that have 
been indicated. 
I ask Leader MCCONNELL to please re-
consider his statements. First, he had 
indicated that we were going to be able 
to address this issue just after the elec-
tion. Politics should not be playing a 
role in this process. 
Now it is, when the new decision 
comes out by the bipartisan group in 
the Senate, he says he rejects it, and 
that maybe after the first of the year 
we will get to it. 
How many Americans have to die be-
fore we get serious about this? How 
many of our fellow citizens have to die, 
our friends, our neighbors? I don’t 
know if there are any family members 
who have died, but they are in danger, 
I can guarantee. 
Our hospitals, our doctors are plead-
ing day after day after day, do some-
thing about this. Please do something 
about this. We are overwhelmed. We 
can find beds for the doctors to be able 
to treat our citizens. What we cannot 
do is find doctors and nurses and tech-
nicians that are working 7 days a week, 
16-hour days, going back to their fami-
lies, going to bed, and coming back 
again. 
I do not understand it at all. If we are 
concerned about the economy, let’s be 
concerned about the economy. The 
more deaths, the worse our economy 
will suffer. 
Homelessness, food instability, in-
creasing mental health issues, edu-
cation, increasing domestic violence, 
crime, this is going to continue to get 
worse unless we address the COVID 
issue now, not later, but now. 
Our leadership has been attempting 
to address this issue for some time. 
There is only one stumbling block and 
that is over in the Senate. 
I don’t care if you agree with what 
has been proposed or not. Sit down at 
the damn table and talk about it. If 
you have to be there 20 hours a day, sit 
down and talk about it. 
You wouldn’t do this in your normal 
life in business. I have never done that 
in my normal life in business. When we 
have something moving forward, we 
work at it, time and time and time 
again; and we have to do that now, 
with COVID. Not later, now. 
URGENT NEEDS OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
also want to talk a little bit about Ari-
zona’s First Congressional District and 
our country, on the need to extend the 
Tribal deadline from December 31 for 
another year to make sure they have 
the opportunity to use the funds that 
were given to them. 
There is an assumption that you can, 
over a 6-month period, put millions of 
dollars out there and get something 
done right away. I know that; I am a 
former project manager. I know to 
build a building it takes 2 to 3 years to 
get the planning done and get the work 
done. 
And here, the CARES Act clearly in-
dicated a need for COVID relief for the 
Tribal Nations, not just because they 
have not been able to address the issue, 
but they need to address the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I say one more time, 
let’s get this COVID thing done. 
f 
CURFEWS AND COMMON SENSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Gov-
ernor Newsom made a groundbreaking 
discovery 
regarding 
COVID–19 
last 
week. Apparently, it has learned to tell 
time. Thus, acting under the strictest 
of scientific standards, he has ordered 
Californians to run home before 10 
p.m., lock their doors, and hide from 
this insidious virus until daybreak. 
Unfortunately, COVID doesn’t seem 
to be following the curfew, so Newsom 
is now threatening yet another hard 
lockdown of virtually the entire State 
throughout the Christmas season. Don 
we now our plague apparel. 
There is just one nagging question 
the Governor hasn’t bothered to an-
swer. If these lockdowns are so success-
ful, why do we need to keep having 
them? 
Now, we are told not to worry. We 
are cheerfully assured that the jobs 
that are being destroyed are non-
essential. That is their term, non-
essential. 
Well, I have news for these self-ab-
sorbed elitists. If a job is putting food 
on your table and a roof over your head 
that job is essential for you and the 
family that depends upon you. 
Last spring, I asked Anthony Fauci if 
he had taken into account the human 
cost of these lockdowns, the suicides, 
the drug and alcohol abuse, the domes-
tic 
violence, 
the 
deferred 
health 
screenings and treatments, and the 
poverty related deaths that his policies 
were setting into motion. No, we really 
haven’t considered that, he breezily re-
plied. 
Don’t know, don’t care. 
But before Fauci and his followers 
took a wrecking ball to our Nation, 
poverty had dropped to its lowest rate 
since 1959. Unemployment was the low-
est in 50 years. The income gap was 
narrowing. Wages showed their strong-
est growth in 40 years. 
How many millions of these jobs have 
now been wantonly destroyed by auto-
cratic officials who seem oblivious to 
the damage that they are causing? 
Now, according to the CDC’s best es-
timate, those under 50 have a 99.98 per-
cent chance of recovering from COVID, 
if they get it at all; 99.98 percent. And 
40 percent who get it don’t even know 
they have it. 
Even for the most vulnerable group, 
over 70, the survival rate is 94.6 per-
cent. 
Now, Sweden did not force its busi-
nesses to close. Sweden didn’t shut 
down its schools and abandon its chil-
dren to the streets. Sweden didn’t even 
adopt a mask mandate. 
Sweden did what free societies do; 
they gave the best advice they could, 
and they trusted their citizens to use 
their own good judgment of what meas-
ures made sense to them. 
The result? Well, as of this morning, 
Sweden’s mortality rate from COVID is 
154 deaths per million below that of the 
United States. If we had Sweden’s rate, 
that would mean over 50,000 fewer 
American deaths from COVID. 
Meanwhile, Sweden has sustained a 
fraction of the economic damage that 
our lockdown leftists have inflicted on 
innocent 
Americans. 
Globally, 
the 
United Nations warns that 130 million 
people will starve to death around the 
world because of the economic damage 
caused by these measures. 
Mr. Speaker, this has to stop. The 
good news is that more and more 
Americans are questioning the lunacy 
of these policies and the hypocrisy of 
those who impose them. Newsom’s cur-
few order was met with spontaneous 
defiant 
demonstrations 
across 
the 
State. Elected sheriffs are increasingly 
refusing to enforce these autocratic or-
ders. 
Pastors 
are 
reopening 
their 
churches. Businesses are reopening, 
even as their owners are taken away in 
handcuffs. 
All mass hysterias are driven by 
blind fear, fanned by politicians and

charlatans who see opportunity in 
them. And we have, sadly, learned that 
such fear can cause a free people to 
abandon their legacy of freedom and 
independence, their prosperity, and 
their common sense, but only for a 
while. 
Every time in history that this has 
happened, there is always a moment 
when the fear fever breaks, and the 
hysteria suddenly burns itself out. The 
French Revolution, the Salem witch 
trials, the Communist hysteria of the 
1950s all had a moment when the ab-
surdity of it all became so apparent 
that it overcame the fear and the peo-
ple turned on their tormentors. 
Now, I don’t know if the recent wave 
of business and religious persecutions, 
the unlimited home detention orders, 
and the demonstrated hypocrisy of 
those who have ordered them signals 
that moment. But every shopkeeper 
who defies these petty tyrants, every 
parent who confronts their school offi-
cials, every person who refuses to sub-
mit to the dysfunctional dystopian 
world created by the lockdown left 
brings us one step closer to that turn-
ing point. It can’t come soon enough. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MAYOR DAVID DINKINS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a great New 
Yorker, someone that has made us all 
proud, someone that we all stand on 
his shoulders, the late Mayor David N. 
Dinkins. 
Words cannot express how we feel in 
New York with the passing of Mayor 
Dinkins. Many of us stand on his shoul-
ders, as many of us here in this Cham-
ber stand on the shoulders of other gi-
ants that came before us. None of us 
really stand on our own. We stand on 
the shoulders of those trailblazers, 
those pioneers that opened the door to 
men and women across the country. 
Mayor Dinkins was such a leader. He 
was the first and, up to today, the only 
African-American mayor in New York 
City, a city that prides itself on diver-
sity. In fact, New York City says that 
its strength really comes from the 
depths of its diversity. 
People from all over the world, immi-
grants, as I was in 1964, coming from 
the Dominican Republic, people from 
all over the world come to New York 
City looking for that dream. Different 
races, ethnicities, religions make New 
York City strong. And Mayor Dinkins 
often called the city a gorgeous mo-
saic, and that was its strength. 
So we honor his legacy and his many 
years of service as a New York State 
Assembly member, as a Manhattan 
borough president, and then, of course, 
as mayor of the city of New York. 
His detractors, and those that at-
tempt to be revisionists of history, will 
never acknowledge the great things 
that he did. But those of us in the 
trenches, in the neighborhoods that 
have 
been 
traditionally 
forgotten, 
those of us that know that our commu-
nities lacked the voices to be heard, 
the disenfranchised of the city of New 
York will forever remember him for his 
accomplishments. 
Community policing, he got $1.8 bil-
lion to establish the community polic-
ing program; foot officers, foot patrol 
officers, in neighborhoods across the 
city of New York fighting crack and 
crime but, most importantly, knowing 
the community, the small business 
owners, having a daily relationship, al-
most as family members, preventing 
the kind of conflict that is plaguing 
America today. 
The beacon schools that he opened 
up, after-school programs that became 
the center of communities across the 
city of New York; the Arthur Ashe Sta-
dium for tennis, which houses the US 
Open and yields more revenue than 
baseball, basketball, and football for 
the city of New York. 
And, of course, that day when he wel-
comed Nelson Mandela to New York 
City, it was such an important day. I 
went to that celebration, and many of 
us in New York felt that day that New 
York was the center of the universe. 
Every neighborhood enjoyed and cele-
brated freedom for South Africa, and 
Mayor Dinkins was our mayor. What a 
great day. What a great mayor. 
What a legacy, Mr. Speaker. 
I stand here to honor that legacy so 
that it will never be forgotten that the 
great, late David N. Dinkins was an in-
tegral part of the gorgeous mosaic that 
he always called New York.

DEMOCRATS PRIORITIZE 
MARIJUANA OVER COVID RELIEF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
in March, our public health experts 
said that we needed to stay home to 
fight this virus and to bend the curve. 
Those public health experts urged the 
administration and Congress to design 
COVID–19 relief that included 8 weeks 
of paycheck protection and enhanced 
unemployment compensation through 
July, all with the thought that that 
was the amount of support that we 
needed to provide, given the nature of 
this virus. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to state 
the obvious: Months later, America re-
mains in the throes of a brutal pan-
demic, Americans are hurting, and Ar-
kansans are hurting. Every day I hear 
from restaurant owners and hotel oper-
ators who are concerned about whether 
or not they will stay in business and 
whether or not they can survive. 
Central Arkansans tell me that they 
are spending more time worried about 
their school kids, keeping their schools 
open, and having reliable broadband to 
be able to do telemedicine and tele- 
education. More central Arkansans are 
taking their meals at food banks. Mr. 
Speaker, frontline workers depend on 
help and our health industry to deliver 
the care that is essential. 
Yet, Mr. Speaker, for what has the 
House leadership and Speaker PELOSI 
brought us back to Washington, D.C., 
to consider? Is it to consider this 
much-needed delivered COVID–19 relief 
for the American people? 
No. 
Is it to extend the deadline for the 
Paycheck Protection Program or bring 
the discharge petition to the House 
floor that House Republicans have pro-
posed, that has over 180 signatures of 
this body to help our small businesses 
who desperately need that assistance? 
No. 
Mr. Speaker, while Arkansans and 
Americans are suffering, and while Re-
publicans are working to extend crit-
ical assistance like the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, our House Demo-
cratic leadership is putting a bill to le-
galize pot on the floor of the United 
States House for a vote. 
Let that sink in. In the midst of this 
pandemic and in the midst of calls 
across the country to help the Amer-
ican people, our leadership in this 
House has proposed a bill to legalize 
pot. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle are showing just how much they 
are out of touch with conditions in our 
country today. People are working to 
make ends meet for their families. 
They are trying to educate their chil-
dren while juggling work obligations. 
They are trying to protect themselves 
and their loved ones from this virus. 
And that is why we are here this 
week: To legalize pot? 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans are lead-
ing. Our discharge petition could help 
small businesses right now, and every 
Democrat should sign it. Yet, Mr. 
Speaker, for 40 times, our Speaker of 
the House has blocked the consider-
ation of extending the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. House Democrats 
need to follow the lead of House Repub-
licans and put Americans above their 
special interest friends by moving 
COVID–19 relief today on this House 
floor, by calling up our discharge peti-
tion and voting on paycheck protection 
relief. 
RECOGNIZING CLAYTON BOOTHE 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an exceptional 
young man in my district, Clayton 
Boothe, who was raised to value a 
broad span of interests. At just 17 years 
old, he is excelling in many of these 
areas. 
He is captain of his quiz bowl team, 
founder of Maumelle High School’s 
chess team, and a member of Arkansas’ 
Governor’s School and the National 
Honor Society. He is ranked top of his 
class, 
and 
he 
is 
one 
of 
16,000 
semifinalists in the 2021 National Merit 
Scholarship Program out of 1.5 million 
nationwide applicants.

FAREWELL ADDRESS TO 
CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
this may be the last time I get to ad-
dress this hallowed Chamber, and for 
that I am grateful for this opportunity. 
I want to start by thanking my staff. 
It may come as a surprise to some of 
my colleagues, as well as the press, but 
I do have some flaws. My staff worked 
with me for 2 years—some of them even 
longer—and together we—not me, we— 
accomplished an extraordinary amount 
for the great people of southern Brook-
lyn and Staten Island. 
As I leave to pursue new adventures, 
I want to depart, though, with a few 
words of optimism for our great coun-
try, as well as a warning. 
We live in a tough time for truth, and 
it is causing faith in our government to 
corrode. There is not a person in this 
Chamber who thinks the American peo-
ple trust us. There is not a person sit-
ting here right now who thinks the 
American people believe in our govern-
ment. 
This didn’t happen overnight. It was 
death by a thousand disappointments, 
a thousand scandals, and a thousand 
lives broken by politicians who mock a 
virus until it kills their neighbor; who 
carve us up into blue States and red 
States, yet have the nerve to question 
someone else’s patriotism; who saw no 
problem whatsoever giving a trillion- 
dollar tax cut to Big Pharma and com-
panies that are killing our planet, but 
then they clutch their pearls when we 
say we want to be there for poor people 
and when we say we want to be there 
for the most vulnerable. 
During my few years in politics, I 
have seen how we can beat back this 
festering cynicism: when we fight like 
hell for what is right, especially for 
those who need us most, when we bring 
converts to our side by promoting 
truth where there is injustice, and by 
appealing to common sense and—God 
forbid—humanity. 
I have seen constituents who thought 
their government was there only to 
screw them over; begin to hope that 
maybe that wasn’t the case when we 
passed the Victim Compensation Fund; 
and when we cut through the red tape 
to finally begin the construction of the 
East Shore Seawall, the largest resil-
iency project in New York City his-
tory. I saw it when we reunited fami-
lies torn apart by the racist Muslim 
ban and when we secured millions to 
combat the opioid epidemic. 
In retrospect, those were the good 
days. 
Then there were days when it felt 
like our politics was absolutely irre-
deemable, when a peaceful march for 
justice in my community was used as a 
weapon to tell my constituents that it 
is impossible to believe that Black 
Lives Matter while also believing that 
the vast majority of police officers are 
heroes. Those marchers were called 
thugs and they were called rioters just 
for believing that peaceful protests 
could change this country. The public 
was told that their movement was dan-
gerous and not something you should 
listen to but something you should be 
afraid of. Yet for those who saw it with 
their own eyes, the truth cut through 
all those smears. 
I remember being outside of a super-
market. It was raining, and I was mis-
erable. An off-duty police officer came 
up to talk to me. He assured me he was 
no Democrat, but he had been working 
that day of the march. He had been 
skeptical, but those young men and 
women changed his mind, and he was 
proud of them. That officer saw past 
the lies and past the differences others 
have used to divide us. He witnessed 
his fellow Americans in pain, and for 
him it changed everything. In typical 
Staten Island fashion, though, right 
after, he told me he wasn’t going to 
vote for me and that I was going to 
lose for a thousand other reasons. 
But conversations like that refreshed 
my memory and my faith that this 
country can one day live up to its 
promise. We can put the government 
back on the side of working people 
from New York City to Washington, 
D.C., and everywhere in between. 
That is the America we know is pos-
sible: One where, in the face of un-
imaginable vitriol, we don’t hate back; 
in the face of unimaginable adversity, 
we don’t give up fighting until it 
doesn’t matter what you look like and 
where you come from, but in this coun-
try you can accomplish your dreams— 
a safe America, a just America, our 
America. 
In light of recent electoral results, 
some have begun to wonder if Demo-
crats should soft-pedal the fight for 
equal justice, if they should take a step 
back from fighting for economic secu-
rity or even just give up. I am here to 
say absolutely not. This cannot wait. 
Justice cannot wait. If you aren’t will-
ing to risk everything to build a better 
country, then you do not belong here in 
the first place. 
Mr. Speaker, to close, representing 
Staten Island and south Brooklyn has 
been the honor of my life. On behalf of 
Leigh, Miles, and myself, I thank the 
people of the 11th Congressional Dis-
trict for this extraordinary privilege. I 
am not sure what life has in store for 
us, but I will be on the front lines mak-
ing sure our city and our country live 
up to its promise. 
May God bless my colleagues with 
the strength to do what is right, and 
may God bless this great country.

REMEMBERING CHAIRMAN BOB 
SMITH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate and honor the 
life and legacy of former Congressman 
Bob Smith. An Oregon native—born in 
Portland and raised in Burns—he had a 
deep understanding of what it meant to 
be an Oregonian and he knew the needs 
of the surrounding communities, espe-
cially the rural part of our State. 
He went to Willamette University in 
Salem and received a degree in agri-
culture. He would go on to put that de-
gree to work on his own ranch. 
In 1960, Bob’s career as a public serv-
ant began when he was elected to the 
Oregon House of Representatives. He 
served in the State house until 1972. He 
was speaker of the Oregon House dur-
ing the 1969 and 1971 sessions. 
I remember as a 13-year-old young-
ster going with my father, whom they 
were recruiting to run for the legisla-
ture, down to Salem to see Bob Smith 
and the speaker of the house. I was 
about this tall. I looked up, and here 
was this giant of a man. He was a giant 
of a man in Oregon politics, but a very 
kind soul. 
He then served in the State senate 
from 1973 to 1982. When Oregon got its 
fifth congressional seat, he ran for that 
and was elected. He actually ran 31 dif-
ferent times for election and never lost 
a single one. 
In the State house, Bob passed a 
number of pieces of legislation. He al-
ways stood up for farmers and ranchers 
in eastern Oregon and for lower taxes. 
He led the effort in the Congress to 
pass a balanced budget amendment. In 
the State senate, he actually helped 
pass the kicker law, which said when 
Oregon collects more tax revenue than 
anticipated, that goes back to the tax-
payer. That went into the constitution 
eventually. 
Bob went on to serve here, as I said, 
for 14 years, from 1983 to 1995, and then 
came back to chair the Agriculture 
Committee when he returned from 1997 
to 1999. 
I am joined here on the floor today 
by a colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. 
LUCAS), who served with Chairman 
Smith on the Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS). 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. It is an honor 
to be here. Discussing my Agriculture 
Committee chairman and my colleague 
for 21⁄2 years, Bob Smith, is truly an 
honor. 
When I was sworn in, in a special 
election and I first surveyed this body, 
one of the faces I recognized was this 
huge figure of a man standing at the 
back brass rail. I can still almost see

Bob right over there surveying the 
House floor and watching the process. 
Bob was one of those folks who had a 
quiet, calm demeanor. He was a won-
derful mentor to me in that first 6 
months, then he went home to the 
ranch for 2 years, and then we begged 
him to come back and lead the Agri-
culture Committee for the next 2 years. 
Bob was a wonderful mentor to me. 
He was a wonderful mentor to the un-
derclassmen. The first times that I 
went with the committee on trips to 
understand 
agriculture 
around 
the 
world was with Bob, and he had a dip-
lomat’s style and skill. He was firm. As 
Congressman WALDEN remembered, he 
wouldn’t take anything from anyone. 
He had a way about him. He gained 
your trust and he gained your con-
fidence. 
It is hard to believe that he is not 
with us anymore. But Bob was one of 
those folks whose personality, his 
heart, and his intellect were just as big 
and broad as those shoulders were. I 
consider myself fortunate for having 
served with him. I know the family will 
miss him with intensity forever. But, 
Mr. Speaker, 89 years is a good, long 
life. I can promise you in the time I 
served with him here, he lived it to the 
fullest. 
b 1045 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, Bob did live life to the 
fullest in every measure. And when he 
and Kaye and Matt and Tiffany and 
Chris all lived back here, they had a 
farm outside in Virginia, and then he 
would commute to Oregon. But on 
weekends when he was here, he and 
then-Commerce 
Secretary 
Mac 
Baldrige would rodeo. They would go 
out and rope and participate in rodeos 
around, and here you had a sitting 
Member of Congress and the Secretary 
of Commerce out in the rodeo grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, Bob lived a life big and 
bold. And ‘‘free man,’’ like his middle 
name, he believed in freedom. He be-
lieved in freedom in America. He stood 
up for eastern Oregon and for our farm-
ers and ranchers and our communities. 
Those of us who fly in and out of cen-
tral Oregon owe a big thank-you to 
him as well since he used his ability in 
this body to get us a tower there so we 
could have real flights in and out of 
central Oregon, and improved, cer-
tainly, the interchange of I–5 and High-
way 62. 
Mr. Speaker, Bob did so much for our 
State. He stood strong for our country. 
He believed in freedom. He was a dear 
friend. 
And to Kaye and to Matt and Chris 
and Tiffany and the whole Smith fam-
ily, we extend our deepest condolences. 
What a life well-lived, a public service 
career that will be tough for anybody 
to ever top. 
VFW POST 334 CELEBRATES 75TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to celebrate the 75th anniversary 
of VFW Post 334 in Oxford, Michigan. 
Since its founding, VFW Post 334 has 
served the local community in Oxford. 
Whether it is their shelf at the Oxford/ 
Orion food pantry, a float in the annual 
Christmas parade, a regular fish fry, or 
maintaining the Orion Veterans Memo-
rial, residents can count on the post to 
show up and support the community. 
Post 334 is committed to making a 
difference in the lives of veterans. By 
praying for those deployed, supporting 
their families at home, providing a 
form to gather and share experiences of 
service, and honoring those who are no 
longer with us, the VFW preserves the 
bonds that are forged through military 
service. 
For its work, Post 334 was recognized 
in 2019 as a Michigan All-State Post for 
the third year in a row. Most recently, 
it was awarded the Diamond Jubilee 
Award, given to VFW charters that 
have demonstrated exceptional service 
for three-quarters of a century. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank 
Quartermaster Chuck Haskin, Senior 
Advisor Commander Randy Stetson, 
and Post Commander Jim Hubbard for 
their leadership and their service to 
the North Oakland community. 
The spirit of Post 334 is perhaps best 
said by Commander Hubbard: ‘‘We 
honor the dead by helping the living.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to these re-
marks which will live on in the RECORD 
of the people’s House, it is my privilege 
to recognize their service by arranging 
for a flag to be flown over the Capitol 
in their honor. This flag will be pre-
sented in Oxford to recognize their con-
tinued service to community and to 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Post 334 
on a successful 75 years and wish them 
the best in the 75 years to come. 
f 
OCC FAIR ACCESS RULE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency’s recently pro-
posed rule to ensure fair access to 
banking services. 
The fair access rule is a welcomed de-
velopment in a time when political cor-
rectness and public relations pressure 
are driving the Nation’s largest banks’ 
lending decisions rather than risk 
metrics associated with an underlying 
loan. 
Banks are deciding to cut off access 
to capital, divest their holdings, or 
otherwise limit financing to legally op-
erating businesses just because those 
businesses are politically unpopular 
with outspoken critics on the far ex-
treme left. Politicizing access to cap-
ital needs to end, and the Fair Access 
rule is a step in the right direction. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
proposed 
rule-
making 
codifies 
longstanding 
prin-
ciples and OCC guidance that banks 
should provide access to capital and 
credit based on the assessment of an 
individual borrower’s risk as opposed 
to making broad-based decisions im-
pacting entire industries. It is guided 
by fundamental principles of non-
discrimination and would ensure that 
banks can’t pick winners and losers in 
the marketplace. This rule will have 
meaningful impacts on some of Amer-
ica’s 
strongest 
industries 
and 
the 
Americans they serve. 
The prohibition against redlining 
based on race, ethnicity, or neighbor-
hood, regardless of an individual’s 
qualifications and creditworthiness, is 
a well-established principle in Federal 
law. That prohibition and that prin-
ciple should be extended to lawful cred-
itworthy businesses as well. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last several 
years, we have witnessed many cases of 
banks publicly committing not to do 
business with certain legal companies. 
Some banks refuse to finance new coal- 
fired plants; others have refused to pro-
vide credit for legally permissible drill-
ing operations; others boycotted fire-
arms manufacturers. 
But these decisions were not based on 
the creditworthiness of the borrowers; 
they were based purely on politics. 
Coal keeps the lights on. Oil and gas 
heat our homes and fuel our vehicles. 
Should coal or oil or gas companies 
be subjected to a different lending 
standard just because of their public 
perception by a select few? Of course 
not. 
These industries should not be penal-
ized simply because of the nature of 
their business and private lenders’ de-
sire to placate the far left. In fact, 
these are companies that provide the 
most affordable and reliable forms of 
energy to the American people. They 
are being punished only because they 
are politically unpopular. 
Under the rule, banks can no longer 
make these qualitative decisions to 
redline entire industries. Industries 
that play crucial roles in the everyday 
lives of Americans deserve fair access 
to America’s financial system and 
should not be demonized as pawns in 
the politics of the day. 
Banks are in the business of assess-
ing, measuring, and managing risks. 
Banks should be making lending deci-
sions based on quantifiable risks asso-
ciated with a loan. If a legally oper-
ating business is a sound credit risk by 
objective standards, banks should not 
be permitted to cut off financing sim-
ply because the business isn’t in the 
good graces of certain politicians. 
Many of the rule’s detractors say it 
is an overreach by the OCC or somehow 
motivated by partisan goals; but, in re-
ality, the rule simply implements di-
rectives under Dodd-Frank to promote 
fair access to financial services and

fair treatment of customers. It codifies 
in regulation statements and guidance 
from financial regulators under Presi-
dent Obama. 
In 2014, then-Comptroller Tom Curry 
said to regulated banks: 
You shouldn’t feel that you can’t bank a 
customer just because they fall into a cat-
egory that, on its face, appears to carry an 
elevated level of risk. Higher risk categories 
of customers call for stronger risk manage-
ment and controls, not a strategy of total 
avoidance. 
Now, some critics of the OCC’s rule 
have made the argument that it would 
compromise financial stability to force 
lenders to extend credit to dying indus-
tries, such as the fossil energy indus-
try, that have no future under leftwing 
policies like the Green New Deal. 
Has it ever occurred to these politi-
cians that the reason why these fossil 
energy companies might face a chal-
lenging future is because of their own 
policies and because of their unrelent-
ing desire to deny them the credit that 
they need to continue to operate. 
Mr. Speaker, the debanking of cer-
tain legally operating industries is one 
in a series of examples of corporate 
leaders succumbing to the pressure of 
activists and far-left politicians. They 
have ceded the primacy of shareholders 
and are now letting politics drive their 
financing decisions. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Acting 
Comptroller Brooks on proposing this 
thoughtful and timely rule of non-
discrimination. This rule will ensure 
that all legal American companies 
have full access to the robust U.S. fi-
nancial system and the economic free-
dom they deserve, and it will put an 
end to the misguided practice of banks 
playing politics with American jobs.

FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLAY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my farewell remarks as a Mem-
ber of the people’s House. And while I 
will be sad to leave this historic place, 
I will forever be grateful for the oppor-
tunity to serve Missouri’s First Con-
gressional District for two decades and 
to have been blessed with the friend-
ship of so many colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I have given my best be-
cause my constituents deserve nothing 
less. I learned that vital lesson about 
public service from my best adviser and 
my personal hero, my dad, former Con-
gressman Bill Clay. The truth is none 
of my success would have been possible 
without my remarkable family. 
I thank the rock of our family, my 
mother, Carol, and my devoted and tal-
ented sisters, Vickie and Michelle. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank my chil-
dren, Carol and Will. No Member serves 
unto themselves. Families also sac-
rifice greatly. 
Carol and Will, you all have made me 
extremely proud. You carry yourselves 
with such dignity, poise, and character. 
There is no greater joy I have than 
being your father. Thank you for being 
my greatest and best legacy. 
To my wonderful wife, Pat, I could 
not have selected a better partner to 
share in my post-congressional career. 
Your love and optimism keep my life 
balanced and exhilarated. I so look for-
ward to our days to come. 
Mr. Speaker, of course, the best part 
of being a Member of Congress has been 
helping tens of thousands of constitu-
ents solve issues with the Federal Gov-
ernment. None of that would have been 
possible without my dedicated and 
compassionate staff over the years: Pa-

I also thank an exceptional American 
who has devoted 48 years of public serv-
ice to the U.S. House, my remarkable 
constituent services director, Edwilla 
Massey. 
I thank my devoted executive assist-
ant and scheduler, Karyn Long. Karyn 
is family. She always went above and 
beyond for me, and I am forever grate-
ful. 
I also especially thank all my chiefs 
of 
staff: 
Harriet 
Grigsby, 
Darryl 
Piggee, and Yvette Cravins. 
In the book of Matthew, chapter 25, 
verses 36–40, the Scriptures read: 
When I was naked, you clothed Me. When I 
was sick, you visited Me. And when I was in 
prison, you came to Me. The righteous an-
swered, ‘‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, 
thirsty, clothed You, or in prison visited?’’ 
And the King answered them, ‘‘Truly I say to 
you, as you did it to the least of these my 
brothers, you did it to Me.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, these Scriptures have 
been a guidepost for my career in pub-
lic service. Over my 10 terms, I have 
fearlessly advocated for the permanent 
interest of African Americans and 
other unheard voices. I have had many 
legislative achievements in this body, 
and I thank all of my colleagues who 
assisted me in doing as the Scriptures 
noted, ‘‘caring for the least of these.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, in my remaining time, I 
highlight a few victories. 
For 14 years, I hosted the Clay Career 
Fair at St. Louis’ HBCU Harris-Stowe 
State 
University, 
which 
connected 
thousands of jobseekers with good-pay-
ing jobs, providing economic stability. 
Creating jobs and economic develop-
ment was a priority for me. We were 
able to build the new $120 million Na-
tional Archives administration center 
in North St. Louis County. 
The greatest economic victory for 
North St. Louis was the bipartisan ef-
fort to build the headquarters of the 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agen-
cy. That $1.7 billion project is the larg-
est single Federal investment in St. 
Louis’ history, of which I am ex-
tremely proud. 
We have also built hundreds of units 
of new housing. We have also expanded 
organ and tissue donation registry. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the leg-
acy and work of Missouri’s First Con-
gressional District. 
May God bless you all. 
f 
IRAN—AMERICA’S GREATEST 
THREAT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ad-
dress one of the greatest threats to 
American safety—Iran. 
Iran is the largest state sponsor of 
terrorism, and from past actions, we 
know the regime cannot be trusted. 
However, 
over 
the 
past 
4 
years, 
progress has been made: 
Our maximum pressure campaign and 
sanctions have reined in Iran’s power; 
Normalization agreements between 
Israel and numerous nations in the re-
gion continue to isolate Iran; 
The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, 
and Sudan have embraced peace and 
cooperation. 
b 1100 
At this moment of success, the 
United States cannot back down. We 
cannot return to one-sided deals that 
strengthen Iran. 
There is little doubt that without our 
efforts, Iran will continue its pursuit 
for a nuclear weapon and regional 
dominance. We must maintain pressure 
on the regime. 
Just last month, the IAEA confirmed 
what we suspected all along: that the 
Iranian regime continues to ramp up 
its nuclear program. In fact, it is accel-
erating its efforts. This is not the time 
to appease the Iranian regime. We 
must stand strong. 
Under the Obama-Biden administra-
tion, we saw years of failed foreign pol-
icy. We saw years of policy that al-
lowed Iran to continue developing a nu-
clear weapon, years of policy that sent 
pallets of cash to Iran, years of policy 
that neglected our alliance with Israel, 
and years of policy that allowed Ira-
nian terrorism to thrive across the re-
gion. 
After the failed Obama-Biden Iran 
deal was implemented, Iran continued 
perpetuating violence, terrorism, and 
proxy wars across the Middle East. 
Iran came closer and closer to obtain-
ing a nuclear weapon. 
President Trump has shown there is 
another way. We do not need to ap-
pease terrorist states and turn our 
backs on Israel. Instead, the Trump ad-
ministration’s strength has helped set 
the conditions for regional peace. Co-
operation between Israel and other 
Middle Eastern states is continuing to 
grow. 
This 
change 
of 
policy 
has 
brought hope. 
Peace is possible. But peace does not 
happen through capitulation, and it 
will not happen if we go backwards. 
It is clear the U.S. sanctions tar-
geting Iran are working. We need to

maintain our sanctions against Iran 
and take decisive steps to prevent eva-
sion. Sanctions have cut off vital re-
sources that Iran’s leaders use to en-
rich themselves and spread terrorism. 
U.S. financial sanctions make it harder 
for Iran to fund its ambitions to be-
come a nuclear power. 
Unfortunately, bad actors work hard 
to get around United States’ sanctions. 
That is why I co-introduced the Pre-
venting Illicit Finance Act. This bill 
supports our maximum pressure cam-
paign and creates a public-private 
group to limit the abuse of the finan-
cial system by bad actors like Iran. My 
bill strengthens the United States’ 
ability to enforce financial sanctions 
against Iran, Russia, and other adver-
saries. 
Our maximum pressure campaign is 
working. We cannot turn a blind eye to 
Iran’s aggressions and pursuit of ter-
rorism. Iran must be held accountable. 
By strengthening our sanctions en-
forcement and maintaining our tough 
approach, we can prevent Iran from be-
coming a nuclear power.

Loving God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
In the waning days of this 116th Con-
gress, we ask Your blessing upon the 
Members of this people’s House and, 
most especially, upon the leadership. It 
is on their shoulders the most impor-
tant negotiations of this Congress have 
been placed. 
They have been entrusted by their 
fellow Americans with the awesome 
privilege and responsibility of sus-
taining the great experiment of demo-
cratic self-government. Give them wis-
dom, grace, insight, and courage to 
forge 
legislation, 
especially 
during 
these trying times of coronavirus pan-
demic, that allows us all to move for-
ward toward an encouraging future. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Mr. Chris Harvey, Director of 
Election, Georgia Office of Secretary of 
State, indicating that, according to the pre-
liminary results of the Special Election held

OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE, 
Atlanta, GA, December 2, 2020. 
Re Fifth Congressional District Runoff Spe-
cial Election Unofficial Results. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: Please accept this cor-
respondence to advise you that the unofficial 
results of the Special Election held on Tues-
day. December 1, 2020, for Representative in 
Congress from the Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia, show that Mr. Kwanza Hall 
received 12,094 votes or 54% of votes of the 
total number of votes cast for that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Mr. Hall was elected as Represent-
ative in Congress from the Fifth Congres-
sional District of Georgia. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified

County, DeKalb County, and Fulton County 
that comprise the Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia, an official Certificate of 
Election will be prepared for transmittal as 
required by law. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you 
have any questions. 
Sincerely, 
CHRIS HARVEY, 
Elections Director.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
KWANZA HALL, OF GEORGIA, AS 
A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the gentleman from Georgia, the Hon-
orable KWANZA HALL, be permitted to 
take the oath of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will Representative- 
elect HALL and the members of the 
Georgia delegation present themselves 
in the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his 
right hand. 
Mr. HALL appeared at the bar of the 
House and took the oath of office, as 
follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear truth faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office to which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 116th Con-
gress.

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
KWANZA HALL TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the 
House, the Honorable KWANZA HALL is 
a native of Atlanta, attended Atlanta 
public schools, and attended the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. 
He worked for the Fulton County 
Government. He was vice president of 
technology 
for 
GoodWorks 
Inter-
national, and he is currently director 
of business development at Mactech 
Engineering. 
In 2002, he was elected to the Atlanta 
Board of Education. In 2005, he was 
elected to the Atlanta City Council, 
District Two, where he served three 
consecutive terms. 
Following the death of our beloved 
colleague, Congressman John Lewis, 
Kwanza qualified to run in the special 
election to fill the unexpired term of 
Congressman Lewis, which was held on 
November 3. There were several can-
didates, but none received the required 
majority under Georgia law. 
On December 1, KWANZA won the run-
off special election. His election means 
that the people of the Fifth Congres-
sional District of Georgia, in Atlanta, 
will be represented and have a voice 
during this lameduck session of the 
116th Congress as we debate and, hope-
fully, enact, among other things, the 
FY 2021 appropriations bill funding the 
operations of the Federal Government 
and much-needed COVID–19 relief for 
America’s families, businesses, and our 
State and local governments. 
He is married to Fulton County Com-
missioner Natalie Hall, and they have 
two sons.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6057 
December 3, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league from the Seventh District of 
Georgia, the Honorable ROB WOODALL. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Georgia for 
yielding. And I want to welcome our 
new colleague to the Chamber. This 
isn’t usually the way that it is, and 
nothing about the path you took to get 
here is usually the way that it is. 
But so often, on this floor, we talk 
about giving a voice to the voiceless, 
and sometimes it seems as if it is a 
simple cliche. I wonder how many of 
my colleagues would put in the kind of 
time and effort that we all put in to 
get reelected to provide a voice, not for 
2 years, not even for 12 months, but for 
the remainder of a cycle. 
It speaks to the character of Mr. 
HALL, and it speaks to his commitment 
to the Fifth Congressional District of 
Georgia that he put himself out there 
and committed himself, as he did 
throughout that campaign cycle, to be 
that voice and to make sure that there 
was not a day that went by that the 
Fifth Congressional District of Georgia 
could have been represented but was 
not. 
You are joining, certainly a very spe-
cial seat, but you are joining a very 
special delegation here, and I want to, 
on behalf of all of the Republicans in 
the Georgia delegation, congratulate 
you and welcome you here today. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, as dean of the Georgia delega-
tion, it is my pleasure to present and 
to welcome to this House and to yield 
to the gentleman from Georgia’s Fifth 
Congressional District, the Honorable 
KWANZA HALL. 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, to my 
colleagues from Georgia, other col-
leagues in the House, I am KWANZA 
HALL and I am so thankful to be here 
today. 
In July, just before Congressman 
Lewis passed away, I had COVID, and I 
spent about 3 weeks lying flat dealing 
with it, and I didn’t know I would be 
here. So God blessed me with that time 
to think about what I would do next 
with my life at the same time Con-
gressman LEWIS had passed away. He 
was a friend. He was a neighbor. He and 
my father served in the civil rights 
movement together. My father, Leon 
Hall, was in Montgomery at the same 
time, and Selma. 
So I had to think about what was 
next for me. And God gave me a choice: 
Do you want to do your business, or do 
you want to do My business? 
And I stepped up and answered the 
call, and He said: I have a mission for 
you. The mission is to run for that of-
fice and serve District Five. 
We have a lot of things on the plate 
in front of us, and I just want to be a 
unifier, a person who can help us get 
some things done on behalf of the least 
of these, as Congressman Lewis would. 
So thank you all for having me. 
Thank you to my mother, my father, 
who is not with us, to the Congressmen 
who have come before me, Wyche 
Fowler, 
and 
Ambassador 
Andrew 
Young.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

LAST MINUTE COVID–19 RELIEF 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, it 
has been 6 months since the President 
signed coronavirus relief legislation. 
Since then, the House has passed two 
comprehensive bills to deliver urgently 
needed relief. Senate Republicans and 
the Trump administration need to do 
the same. 
Northern Illinoisans are doing every-
thing they can to be safe and provide 
for their families, but this is a once-in- 
a-century pandemic and no community 
can weather this alone. We must come 
together. 
America is nearing a million new 
cases a week. Families are struggling 
and facing an uncertain future. Small 
businesses are closing their doors. Chil-
dren are going hungry. 
If we, as a Congress do not act now, 
folks at home will be forced to face 
their toughest winter yet, without the 
support they need as human beings and 
deserve as Americans. 
Our communities are working to-
gether to help mitigate the spread of 
this virus. Now Congress must work to-
gether to pass a robust, evidence-based 
relief package. The American people 
are doing everything they can. Con-
gress must do so, too. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF FRED RANDLE 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Mr. Fred Randle. 
Mr. Randle was a longtime Hot 
Springs resident who was part of 
Merrill’s Marauders during World War 
II. Merrill’s Marauders were U.S. sol-
diers who fought in the Pacific The-
ater, using jungle warfare techniques 
to penetrate deep behind enemy lines. 
In just 5 months, the Marauders ad-
vanced 720 miles through some of the 
harshest jungle terrain in the world. 
Upon return, each man in the unit was 
awarded a Bronze Star. 
Mr. Randle’s book, ‘‘Hell on Land, 
Disaster at Sea—the Story of Merrill’s 
Marauders and the Sinking of the 
Rhona,’’ 
described 
his 
experience 
watching the sinking of this ship in 
1943. He was one of a handful of men 
with the Marauders who had been 
sworn to secrecy about the sinking for 
57 years, since it was caused by the 
world’s first guided missile. 
Mr. Randle passed away at the age of 
97 on November 23, 2020. But before he 
did, we were able to contact him and 
his family and let them know that a 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal 
will 
be 
placed in the Smithsonian in his honor. 
Perhaps there is no better tribute to 
his life than in the words of his family, 
He loved the Lord and he loved the 
United States flag.

PROTECTING THE PAYCHECK 
PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because COVID–19 is threatening the 
American Dream across Main Streets 
throughout Minnesota and this Nation. 
Small business relief is needed now 
more than ever. 
Unfortunately, the support we have 
provided is poised to become a signifi-
cant tax burden for some business own-
ers due to a misguided interpretation 
by the Treasury Department. We can-
not allow struggling businesses to be 
taxed on the aid we have provided to 
them as a lifeline. 
Fortunately, there is a solution in 
place to rectify this mistake. In May, I 
joined Representatives LIZZIE FLETCH-
ER and ANDY KIM to introduce H.R. 
6574, the Protecting the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program Act, which would en-
sure that PPP loan recipients whose 
loans are forgiven are not required to 
treat the loan proceeds as taxable in-
come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in defending our Nation’s small 
businesses by supporting this common-
sense legislation.

REMEMBERING SENATOR TOM 
CASPERSON 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of Michigan’s First 
Congressional District in memory of a 
friend, devoted father and husband, and 
dedicated public servant, Senator Tom 
Casperson, who passed away on Sun-
day, November 29, after a hard-fought 
and courageous battle with cancer.

was a fierce advocate in Lansing for 
our Upper Peninsula way of life. 
Tom was a strong and universally re-
spected voice, confronting challenging 
issues head-on and working across the 
aisle for the benefit of his constituents. 
His unwavering commitment to his 
family, his faith, and his community is 
unquestionable. The entire State of 
Michigan is a better place because of 
him. 
To Tom’s family and friends, Isaiah 
41:10 says: 
Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be 
dismayed, for I am your God. I will strength-

My righteous right hand.

AMERICAN PEOPLE WAITING FOR 
COVID RELIEF 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, December’s rent and mortgage 
payments came due for millions of 
Americans, 
marking 
another 
gut- 
wrenching deadline for families who 
have been forced to make the impos-
sible decision between putting food on 
the table or keeping a roof overhead. 
We have been asking for months for 
the Senate to take up one of the relief 
packages that the House has passed 
and sent for consideration or for the 
Senate to come up with its own COVID 
relief proposal. While there has finally 
been some movement this week, it is 
way overdue. 
My constituents cannot wait any 
longer. As the coronavirus surges yet 
again in my region, I hear every single 
day from folks who have exhausted 
every resource to scrape by, but they 
cannot make ends meet without more 
relief. 
These are folks like Denise from 
Linwood. Last spring, she and her hus-
band both lost their jobs in the hospi-
tality industry. They have two kids at 
home learning virtually. Now they are 
faced with the expiration of unemploy-
ment benefits, and they fear eviction 
come January. 
Ann from Wayne is a schoolteacher 
who is trying to get a COVID test so 
she can take care of her elderly mother 
and do her job, but she has had to jump 
through hoop after hoop because we 
still lack a national testing strategy. 
My constituents and our local offi-
cials are doing everything in their 
power to feed their families and stay 
safe. It is past time that the Federal 
Government does the same. America is 
waiting. 
f 
HONORING SENATOR TOM 
CASPERSON 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to follow up on the comments from the 
Congressman from the First District of 
Michigan. 
Today, I recognize a good friend and 
great American, Tom Casperson, who 
passed away this weekend. Tom lived 
in Representative BERGMAN’s district 
in Escanaba, Michigan. 
I knew Tom as a State senator when 
he worked on numerous issues across 
State lines with me. The Good Neigh-
bor Authority promoting better man-
agement of our national forests origi-
nated at a hearing Tom and I put to-
gether in Breitung Township, Michi-
gan. Tom Casperson may have had a 
greater impact on Upper Peninsula 
issues in the Michigan Legislature 
than anyone who served the Upper Pe-
ninsula. 
While I knew Tom as a State senator, 
he will be remembered for far more 
than that, including as a man of great 
faith. 
Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest sym-
pathies to Tom’s wife, Diane, and their 
family. 
It has been a great privilege to have 
known such a fine man. May Tom 
Casperson rest in peace. 
f 
DECRIMINALIZING CANNABIS 
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, in my city 
of Philadelphia and across the country, 
people of color are thrown in jail more 
and with harsher sentences than White 
people for the same cannabis-related 
crimes. 
Cannabis is one of the fastest grow-
ing U.S. industries, but Federal law 
keeps many businesses of color out of 
this market. That is why I urge my 
colleagues to support passage of a jobs 
bill, the MORE Act. It would decrimi-
nalize cannabis at the Federal level 
and expunge prior Federal convictions 
related to marijuana. Half of all States 
have already decriminalized cannabis. 
This jobs bill would also create the 
opportunity trust fund, which would 
generate grant programs to provide 
services and funds to those most nega-
tively impacted by the war on drugs. 
This includes the equitable cannabis li-
censing program that I introduced in 
the Homegrown Act. 
The House and Senate need to pass 
the MORE Act now, as the growing 
cannabis industry is an important eco-
nomic development tool for commu-
nities of color like mine. Let’s pass 
this jobs bill.

CONGRATULATING DR. DIANA 
GREENE 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Duval Coun-
ty Public Schools Superintendent Dr. 
Diana Greene. 
This week, she was named the Flor-
ida Superintendent of the Year by the 
Florida Association of District School 
Superintendents, and we are all incred-
ibly proud of her well-deserved recogni-
tion. 
Over these last 5 years, including 
during Dr. Greene’s leadership, the 
Duval graduation rate increased from 
76 percent to 86 percent, an amazing ac-
complishment. 
She has also helped to improve safety 
and security within our schools and 
fought to secure additional educational 
funding 
for 
Duval 
County 
Public 
Schools. Dr. Greene is an excellent ex-
ample and mentor to both educators 
and students alike. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank Dr. 
Greene for her commitment to edu-
cation and for working hard every day 
to make Duval County Public Schools 
a place where students can learn, grow, 
and thrive.

CALLING FOR COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today on behalf of every 
American who has lost a loved one be-
cause of this pandemic. I rise for those 
who have lost their jobs or who are 
struggling to make ends meet in the 
wake of this virus. I rise for the doc-
tors, the nurses, the caregivers, and 
the first responders who put them-
selves at risk every day as they try to 
save lives. 
These folks in my district and across 
the Nation know that the enemy is not 
our neighbors or our political oppo-
nents. The enemy is this virus. And 
they are counting on us to come to-
gether to provide relief. 
We must act urgently to provide 
State and local governments with the 
funding they need to maintain essen-
tial workers and provide critical serv-
ices, including in public safety and 
education. 
We must act so that small businesses 
don’t shutter their doors, laying off the 
good people who live and work in our 
communities. 
The American people cannot and 
should not have to wait any longer. I 
urge my colleagues to put their dif-
ferences aside and treat this emergency 
like our lives depend on it—because 
they do.

CONGRATULATING RITEDOSE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, congratulations to Ritedose 
Corporation of Columbia, a South 
Carolina company on the front lines of 
America’s spectacular effort to secure 
a coronavirus vaccine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6059 
December 3, 2020 
Thursday, it was announced that 
Ritedose has been selected as a subcon-
tractor of ApiJect Systems America, 
led by CEO Franco Negron, to produce 
prefilled single-dose syringes for the 
vaccine. 
In 4 months, Jody Chastain, the 
president and CEO of Ritedose, and his 
talented team have up-fitted a facility 
that will produce up to 45 million doses 
a month of the vaccine. That is Amer-
ican ingenuity at its best, and it is our 
capable workforce in South Carolina at 
their best. 
The Ritedose success in Operation 
Warp Speed, led by Vice President 
MIKE PENCE, is a historic achievement 
and another Donald Trump victory, 
which the fake media will distort. 
I am grateful that The Ritedose Cor-
poration is integral in this effort for 
the health and safety of American fam-
ilies. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the cour-
age of Claudia Tenney. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
ROBERT S. WASHOCK, JR. 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory of a hero in my 
community who recently passed away 
from this devastating virus. Robert S. 
Washock, Jr., or Bob as he was known 
to everyone, was a devoted father, 
grandfather, 
husband, 
brother, 
and 
friend. He defended our Nation in the 
United States Navy and was a member 
of Dyle E. Bray VFW Post 739 in Ban-
gor, Pennsylvania, serving as quarter-
master and treasurer of the Home As-
sociation. 
I am fortunate to have had the oppor-
tunity to know Bob, and the qualities 
that I can speak to are those that 
touched the lives of countless people 
across 
our 
community: 
kindness, 
humor, and compassion. The tributes 
that have poured in from people of 
every walk of life reflect the world of 
difference that he made. 
At this extraordinarily difficult time 
for Bob’s family and many friends, I ex-
tend my deepest condolences. On behalf 
of a grateful community, it is my 
honor to pay tribute to Bob for his life-
long service as an Active Duty service-
member and as a proud veteran to the 
country he loved. His spirit will en-
dure. 
f 
PRIORITIZING NEEDS OF 
AMERICAN PEOPLE 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to call attention 
to the only bill subject to a rule this 
week in the House of Representatives, 
the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvest-
ment and Expungement Act. 
Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans 
are unemployed right now due to this 
unprecedented 
pandemic, 
wondering 
how they are going to make ends meet, 
and thousands are dying each day from 
the COVID virus. But instead of work-
ing to find a bipartisan solution to pro-
vide relief to Americans, our Demo-
cratic majority wants us to convene 
this august body to vote on pot legisla-
tion. 
This is simply unbelievable. The Re-
publican Senate has voted multiple 
times on targeted relief that Repub-
licans and Democrats agree upon, but 
Senate Democrats have blocked each 
effort. 
We all agree that more PPP funds 
need to be made available. We all agree 
that unemployment benefits should be 
extended. 
We 
all 
agree 
that 
our 
healthcare workers need additional 
funding. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to prioritize 
the needs of the American people, not 
Cheech and Chong. This is wrong and 
needs to be called out. 
f 
GIVING CREDIT TO OPERATION 
WARP SPEED 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, since the 
outbreak of the coronavirus in the 
United States, the promise of the de-
velopment of a vaccine has allowed 
Americans to remain optimistic in the 
midst of tragedy. Now, after months of 
sacrifice, the coronavirus vaccine has 
been 
found. 
This 
accomplishment 
would not have been possible without 
the hard work of scientists working 
around the world and the support by 
the tremendous feat of government in-
novation known as Operation Warp 
Speed. 
Now, following the discovery of the 
vaccine, we must focus on the produc-
tion and distribution of the vaccine to 
the American people and to those 
across the globe. 
Public officials are optimistic that 
distribution of the vaccine could begin 
in a matter of weeks, a massive jump 
forward in the process to rid the world 
of this dangerous virus. This produc-
tion of millions of dosages of vaccine 
will not happen overnight, but thanks 
to Operation Warp Speed and the 
Trump administration, the vaccine will 
reach vulnerable Americans faster than 
anticipated, saving thousands of lives 
in the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all who helped 
advance 
this 
extraordinary 
accom-
plishment.

IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM E. 
‘‘BILLIE’’ CLANTON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
William E. ‘‘Billie’’ Clanton of Odum, 
Georgia, who passed away on November 
27. 
Billie was raised in Wayne County 
and grew up picking tobacco and har-
vesting turpentine on his family farm. 
He was born with a robust entrepre-
neurial spirit which caused him to go 
from managing a successful fruit stand, 
as well as many other businesses, all 
the way to owning and operating the 
Chrysler Dodge dealership in 1965. 
Billie went on to serve as vice presi-
dent of Southeastern Chrysler and 
Dodge Advertising board for 30 years. 
He was an avid supporter of Wayne 
County and was very active in his com-
munity. 
Billie was a 12-year host of the Day 
for Wayne, an event at his farm, which 
is a great event held in support of 
Wayne County. It is truly enjoyed by 
many every year and something I al-
ways look forward to. 
Because of his prominence in his 
community and his life devoted to 
serving others, the new Highway 169 
Overpass will be dedicated in his name. 
Mr. Speaker, my deepest thoughts 
and prayers go out to Billie’s family, 
his wife, Nell; his five daughters; his 16 
grandchildren; his seven great-grand-
children, and two more on the way; his 
friends; and the entire Wayne commu-
nity during this most difficult time. 
f 
PROXY VOTING 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, for 
months, Democrats have used an un-
constitutional scheme to allow Mem-
bers to vote from home. They call it 
proxy voting. I call it exactly what it 
is: shadow voting. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats are turning 
away from their responsibility to their 
constituents by staying home and 
handing their voting card to NANCY 
PELOSI. They are handing over their 
voting card and not coming to work. 
But why? What is so important that 
they can’t show up? Do you know what 
we found? Because they wanted to at-
tend a space launch that never took 
off, or they want to hang out on their 
boat. Who knows what else they have 
done. 
Mr. Speaker, they don’t have to show 
up to vote because, guess what. Some-
one else will do it for them. Maybe if 
we renamed Congress ‘‘The French 
Laundry,’’ they all might show up here. 
This has been going on for months, 
and Democrats have worked overtime 
to hide it from the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, to date, there have been 
4,836 votes cast in this body by law-
makers who weren’t even here. 
Think about that: 4,836 votes cast in 
this body by Members who weren’t 
even here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6060 
December 3, 2020 
Over a dozen lawmakers have given 
their vote to NANCY PELOSI on every 
single bill since this scheme was in 
place. Last night, the number was over 
60 Democrats. Nearly one-third of the 
entire conference of the Democratic 
Party did not show up for work. I 
promise you, each and every one of 
them will get their paycheck. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans are working 
hard to keep their businesses open, to 
keep food on the table and their kids in 
school. They deserve a Representative 
who will show up for the job, the job 
that they said they would do, the job 
they asked people to vote for them so 
they would come to Washington to give 
their voice to Congress, not to give it 
to NANCY PELOSI. 
Mr. Speaker, this is embarrassing. 
This week is only about cats and can-
nabis when it should be about COVID. 
Think for one moment of what we are 
going to do in this body with the his-
tory of what has happened on this 
floor: the battle of civil rights; the 
question of whether to end World War 
I or World War II; the question of 
whether every man and woman is 
equal. Those are the things that we de-
bate on this floor. And they were de-
bated in the times of need. 
But what is of need to the American 
public? We all know the challenges 
faced before us. We have been fighting 
it for months. But 40 times on this 
floor the Democrats have said no. 
Mr. Speaker, our own Speaker of the 
House said we would not leave this 
body until we voted on COVID relief. 
They had 40 times to do it, and they 
said no. 
Mr. Speaker, 4,836 times a Member 
didn’t even show to cast a vote, and 
they still got paid. What about all 
those businesses that are shut down 
now permanently? There is more than 
$130 billion sitting to go to the workers 
for small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, 23 Democrats on the 
other side signed a letter in September 
and said: If we do not get a COVID re-
lief bill, we will sign that discharge pe-
tition. 
And what does that do for the Amer-
ican public? It goes around the Speaker 
of the House so the voice could actu-
ally come to the floor and the bill 
could be here and voted upon. And they 
said they would sign it if nothing hap-
pened. I wonder if their word will be 
kept, because I looked at the book and 
it hasn’t. 
The Speaker of the House said we 
would not leave unless we had COVID 
relief. But they call us back, and what 
do they call us back for? The post of-
fice. 
Well, Republicans put up COVID re-
lief on the floor that day, but Demo-
crats said no. They call us back this 
week when people are hurting, people 
are losing their jobs. Maybe that is 
why one-third of the Democrats don’t 
show, because they don’t want to show 
their face to the constituents, that the 
only thing they are going to do on the 
floor this week is vote about cats and 
cannabis. 
Mr. Speaker, that is wrong, and you 
know it. Everybody in this body knows 
it. It is despicable. 
If Democrats want to waste the 
American people’s time with these ri-
diculous bills, they will need to show 
up to do it. Republicans won’t be a 
party to this unconstitutional, un-
democratic mess any longer. 
f 
PROXY VOTING 
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I will tell 
you that I have sat here and listened to 
some of the 1 minutes from my friends 
across the aisle, and they are talking 
about the need for COVID relief. 
Apparently, to get COVID relief, you 
have got to have cannabis. You have 
got to have pot. That is the Democrats’ 
version of COVID relief this week. 
But they don’t feel like they all need 
to be here to deal with this issue, so 
they are going to mail it in. They are 
going to phone in their votes, and, 
quite frankly, in a most disturbing and 
unconstitutional manner. 
Mr. Speaker, we can be here; they 
should be here. If this meant every-
thing that they say it does, they would 
show up. They would show up and vote. 
We could have had committee hear-
ings, for Pete’s sakes. We could have 
committee hearings where we could 
discuss and debate. We would have 
floor debates with open rules. And you 
know what? People would show up. 
f 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I move that 
the House do now adjourn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to adjourn 
offered by the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 3884, MARIJUANA OPPOR-
TUNITY 
REINVESTMENT 
AND 
EXPUNGEMENT ACT OF 2019 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1244 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1244 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 3884) to decriminalize 
and deschedule cannabis, to provide for rein-
vestment in certain persons adversely im-
pacted by the War on Drugs, to provide for 
expungement of certain cannabis offenses, 
and for other purposes. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute recommended by the Committee 
on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute 
consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 116–67, modified by the amendment 
printed in the report of the Committee on 
Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be 
considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill, as 
amended, are waived. The previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as 
amended, and on any further amendment 
thereto, to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit with or without instructions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), 
my good friend, pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
b 1400 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin, I feel I need to respond to the 
meltdown that occurred right before 
the vote on the Republican side. 
As the distinguished minority leader 
knows, House Democrats have sent two 
major coronavirus relief bills over to 
the Senate. Sadly, those bills have 
been gathering dust on MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s desk. He has refused to schedule 
a vote and a debate on those bills. 
But the good news is that today, at 
12:45, we find out that Leader MCCON-
NELL and Speaker PELOSI have spoken 
about their shared commitment to 
completing an omnibus and COVID re-
lief package as soon as possible. I take 
that as good news. 
We can walk and chew gum at the 
same time in this Democratic-con-
trolled House of Representatives. That 
means we need to deal with not only 
passing an omnibus bill and a COVID 
relief bill, but we have other work that 
needs to be done as well. 
I find it curious, Mr. Speaker, that 
the bill the minority leader objected to 
is a bill that deals with the unequal en-
forcement of our drug laws where peo-
ple are treated differently and more 
negatively because of the color of their 
skin. Really? 
My distinguished Republican friend 
did not object to any of the bills we are 
bringing up today sponsored by Repub-
licans—five 
different 
bills—but 
he 
chose to object to a bill that is address-
ing the issue of racial justice. 
Now, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised 
because it is consistent with the atti-
tudes that come out of this White 
House, but it also makes clear to me 
that the Republican Party is no longer 
the party of Lincoln. It is the party of 
some of the most intolerant voices on 
the rightwing and those who dabble in 
conspiracy theories. It really is sad. 
The Republicans made a motion that 
the House do now adjourn to highlight 
the fact that we are able to vote re-
motely in this Chamber in the midst of 
a pandemic. The leader said that near-
ly one-third of the Democratic Caucus 
didn’t vote yesterday, which, by the 
way, they did because we do have re-
sponsible voting rules in place in the 
middle of this pandemic. Now, get this, 
Mr. Speaker. But then, right after say-
ing that, 95 percent of the Republican 
Conference didn’t even show up to vote. 
You can’t make this stuff up, Mr. 
Speaker. 
They didn’t vote in person, and they 
didn’t vote remotely—nothing. Maybe I 
am missing something here, but I don’t 
think the strategy was very well 
thought through. 
The distinguished minority leader is 
puzzled why we have passed rules that 
allow people to vote remotely during 
this pandemic. I have a news flash for 
him: Close to 275,000 people are dead. 
We have colleagues, both Democratic 
colleagues and Republican colleagues, 
who have been infected by this virus. 
While many Republicans are rushing 
to 
attend 
maskless 
superspreader 
Christmas parties at the White House, 
we in the Democratic majority are fol-
lowing the guidelines by the Attending 
Physician in the Capitol, by the CDC, 
by Dr. Fauci, and by every reputable 
medical expert in the world. 
Operating remotely during a pan-
demic, I want to tell my friend, is not 
radical, it is not unique, and it is not 
unprecedented or lazy. It is respon-
sible. It is constitutional. The Supreme 
Court is working remotely, as are leg-
islators around the country and around 
the world. 
We aren’t doing this because it is 
convenient, Mr. Speaker. We are doing 
it because it is necessary, and we are 
doing it because we want to save lives. 
So, we invite our Republican col-
leagues to join us, to be responsible, 
and to understand why these rules are 
so incredibly important and maybe set 
an example for others in this country, 
especially those who operate in 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 1244, providing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6062 
December 3, 2020 
for the consideration of H.R. 3884, the 
Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment 
and Expungement Act, under a closed 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. It self-exe-
cutes 
a 
manager’s 
amendment 
by 
Chairman NADLER, and it provides for 
one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
continue our effort to reform our Na-
tion’s failed approach to the war on 
drugs, to put racial justice at the heart 
of our Nation’s Federal cannabis pol-
icy, and to make restorative justice a 
reality for so many Americans. This is 
what the public has demanded for so 
long, that Congress address the broken 
status quo that allows the color of 
someone’s skin to dictate the repercus-
sions of their actions. 
This is not hyperbole, Mr. Speaker. 
Cannabis accounts for almost half of 
all drug arrests in our country—half. 
Most are arrested for possessing small 
amounts, not for selling or manufac-
turing anything. 
That is bad enough. But today in 
America, Mr. Speaker, you are nearly 
four times more likely to be arrested 
for cannabis if you are Black. Commu-
nities of color use cannabis at roughly 
the same rate as their White counter-
parts, but if you look like me, Mr. 
Speaker, you are far less likely to face 
the same penalties. 
I am not okay with that, and nobody 
should be. I am not okay with a system 
that treats those who have been con-
victed of minor cannabis offenses like 
they are some kind of drug kingpin. 
And I am not okay with a system that 
sends people to prison for cannabis-re-
lated offenses even in States where rec-
reational cannabis use has been legal-
ized. 
To do nothing about this is intoler-
able, and to pretend like this is a prob-
lem for communities of color to solve 
alone is inexcusable. 
America’s failed war on drugs helped 
create this problem. It will take a na-
tional, holistic approach to resolve it. 
H.R. 3884 represents a major step for-
ward. It complements other bipartisan 
criminal justice reform bills passed in 
this Congress and in the 115th Con-
gress. 
This underlying bill removes can-
nabis from the Controlled Substances 
Act, decriminalizing it at the Federal 
level so States can set their own laws. 
It also puts a process in place to ex-
punge prior convictions made in Fed-
eral courts and establishes services to 
help those convicted of cannabis-re-
lated crimes whose lives have been 
harmed by the war on drugs, because 
no lives should be destroyed by this 
failed policy. 
Finally, this bill also makes Small 
Business Administration funding avail-
able for legitimate cannabis-related 
businesses while helping ensure people 
of color can participate in this thriving 
industry. 
This is what beginning to reverse the 
failed war on drugs looks like, Mr. 
Speaker. It is a testament to all of 
those who have fought for a fresh and 
more effective approach year after year 
after year. 
Now, I have worked side by side with 
many of them in this effort since I was 
first elected to Congress back in 1996. 
For so long, we were told the same 
thing. We were told to wait, to wait, to 
wait. Well, cannabis-related amend-
ments couldn’t even get a fair fight on 
this floor under the prior Republican 
Congresses. Not a single one was ever 
made in order in the 112th, 113th, or 
114th Congresses—not one. We could 
bring no bill to the floor related to can-
nabis. The only one made in order last 
Congress was an amendment to eradi-
cate illegal grow operations on Na-
tional Forest System land. 
Congress has stood idly by for too 
long as communities of color, in par-
ticular, were being torn apart. This 
majority, Mr. Speaker, is committed to 
doing something about it. The House 
has debated more amendments on can-
nabis policy last year than it did dur-
ing my entire 20 years in Congress, and 
now we are moving forward with the 
most sweeping reforms in generations. 
This is what a more responsive Con-
gress looks like. 
Now, some, particularly on the other 
side, have wondered why we are moving 
forward with these reforms now. We 
must soon fund the government for the 
next fiscal year and pass the annual de-
fense bill. We are also trying to prod 
the Senate to get serious about a true 
COVID relief bill. 
Again, as I said earlier, we have a lit-
tle bit of hopeful news, based on the 
conversation between the Speaker and 
the Senate majority leader. We have a 
lot to do in the waning days of this 
Congress, and I get that. But the an-
swer is simple. This is not an either-or 
proposition. Congress, as I said before, 
can walk and chew gum at the same 
time. 
A recent survey found that nearly 60 
percent of Americans support this un-
derlying bill. That includes a majority 
of both Democrats and Republicans. 
The facts are clear, and the public 
wants Congress to act. 
The question is, what are we going to 
do about it? 
I think it is time for us to take a 
stand, to stand for restorative justice, 
to stand for racial justice, to stand for 
criminal justice reform, and to stand 
with the majority of Americans de-
manding reforms to our Nation’s can-
nabis policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate my friend from Massa-
chusetts yielding me the customary 30 
minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, this may very well be 
the last rule I do down here on the 
floor of the House, and I was sad when 
SUSAN was reading from the rule be-
cause I have gotten to do some hum-
dingers. We have done some serious 
legislating in the 10 years I have been 
in Congress. We have done some serious 
rulemaking in the 2 years Mr. MCGOV-
ERN has been chairman of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, you can always tell 
when we have been burning the mid-
night oil in the Rules Committee be-
cause the rule will take a good 7, 8, or 
9 minutes to read here on the floor of 
the House. Why? Because getting good 
legislation done is a complicated, dif-
ficult thing to do. It involves a lot of 
give and take; it involves a lot of 
voices at the table; and it involves a 
lot of time in the Rules Committee to 
make that happen. 
Mr. Speaker, we are down here today 
surrounded by Purell wipes, hand sani-
tizer, and social distancing, and we are 
not here to talk about that COVID 
package that my friend from Massa-
chusetts referenced. We are here to, 
sadly, participate in what has become a 
theme in this Congress, and that is 
folks will have the germ of a wonderful 
idea on the Democratic side of the 
aisle. They will nurture that idea in 
their Democratic Caucus, and they will 
put together all the parts of that idea 
they believe need to come together in 
their Democratic Caucus. Then, we will 
come to the House floor, and we will 
pass that idea with Democratic votes. 
Then, we will be vexed, truly vexed, 
about why that idea goes to the United 
States Senate and dies. 
I say truly vexed, Mr. Speaker. I have 
been here a long time. We have seen 
this happen. Leadership of both parties 
knows, when you put together an idea 
all by yourself, when you don’t take 
the time to get all the voices in the 
room together, and when you don’t 
take the time to build the strategic 
partnerships, then good ideas do die. 
Sometimes it is on the way to the 
other Chamber; sometimes it is in con-
ference; and sometimes it is on the 
President’s desk. 
We had numerous amendments of-
fered to this bill. None but the man-
ager’s amendment was made in order. 
We had Republican advocates for many 
of the provisions in this bill speak of 
the opportunity to do something to-
gether but that those opportunities 
were missed along the road in the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
I take my friend from Massachusetts’ 
comments to heart when he is so en-
thusiastic by a conversation that our 
Speaker has had with the majority 
leader in the Senate. I, too, am excited 
about that because talking about what 
we have done all by ourselves in a par-
tisan way doesn’t lead to positive out-
comes for my constituency. Our leader-
ship in the Democratic-led House get-
ting together with the leadership in 
the Senate, the Republican-led Senate, 
that kind of bipartisan partnership 
does lead to good outcomes for our con-
stituents back home. I am hopeful that 
we will be able to see that come to fru-
ition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6063 
December 3, 2020 
Today, however, we do not have the 
COVID package. We have the Mari-
juana Opportunity Reinvestment and 
Expungement Act. Mr. Speaker, I have 
long said that we needed to have a bill 
like this on the floor of the House. My 
friend from Massachusetts tells me we 
have debated more marijuana amend-
ments in the past 2 years than we have 
in the past 20 years. I take him at his 
word that that is true. I don’t think 
this is a topic that we have not been 
spending enough time on. I think it is 
a topic that has received more than its 
fair share of attention in this Congress. 
The racial equities that my friend 
talks about deserve better than to be 
part of a partisan package that goes 
nowhere. The generational disparities 
that my friend from Massachusetts 
talks about deserve better than to be 
part of a package that has been cobbled 
together for the floor rather than built 
together for the President’s desk. 
b 1415 
I agree with absolutely every heart-
felt comment my friend from Massa-
chusetts shared, from the time being 
now, to the opportunities that have 
been wasted, to the inability to have 
these discussions when we need to and 
the ability that we have had recently 
to have them more. 
So to have all of that truth there to 
be wasted on a December 3 package 
that will not be moving anywhere, I 
would say to my friend, I believe hurts 
me as much as I know it will hurt him. 
He does not go through these efforts to 
simply be a part of the motion; he goes 
through these efforts because he be-
lieves in the goal. I regret that this ap-
pears to be another messaging exercise 
in front of us today. 
NDAA, Mr. Speaker, National De-
fense Authorization Act, a bill that we 
have come together as Republicans and 
Democrats to speak with one voice on 
for over 60 years, still hangs out there, 
needs to be done by this year; funding 
of the Federal Government, not just 
because of all the healthcare items, but 
because of those more mundane items, 
from transportation to education to 
our veterans—all of those dollars need 
to be provided. 
Reauthorization of program after 
program, like the United States Coast 
Guard, for example, we have priority 
after priority after priority that this 
House still has left to accomplish, not 
in a partisan way, but in a unified way 
that can move through the United 
States Senate and on to the President’s 
desk. I know we are going to get to 
these priorities, but it is not without 
some frustration that I find myself on 
the floor here again talking about bills 
that will not be on their way to the 
President’s desk. 
I find myself talking in a dis-
appointed tone with my friend from 
Massachusetts 
about 
opportunities 
that we have to make a difference for 
families, but opportunities that are 
going to be missed because of the way 
we have crafted it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat this rule and give us a chance to 
do better. In the absence of that, I also 
will have an opportunity to defeat the 
previous question and bring up some of 
those COVID packages that really can 
make a difference for our friends back 
home. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague, the distinguished member of 
the Committee on Rules from Georgia, 
I, too, hope that the renewed interest 
in both Houses in passing COVID relief 
yields fruit sooner rather than later. It 
does require that the Senate make it a 
priority, and I have been advised that 
the Senate’s priority this afternoon 
once again is confirming another con-
servative judge. So we will both have 
to hold out hope as we move forward. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
am 
here 
today, 
pleased to rise in support of today’s 
rule and the underlying legislation, the 
MORE Act. 
It becomes clearer by the day that 
the time is long overdue for the Fed-
eral Government to bring its mari-
juana policy into the 21st century. 
The current approach has failed our 
youth, has failed to stem more harmful 
drug usage, and, most notably, has 
failed communities of color across the 
United States. That is because, when it 
comes to marijuana, there are two jus-
tice systems in the United States: a 
gentler, more understanding system 
mostly available to White Americans, 
and a punitive, less-forgiving system 
primarily enforced against Black and 
Brown Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, this isn’t justice. This 
is not who we must be as a nation. 
Thousands of people, mostly younger 
Black and Brown men, remain incar-
cerated, while a growing number of 
States, including Pennsylvania, have 
decriminalized and legalized marijuana 
for medicinal and recreational use. 
The question is no longer whether we 
are living in a world if we will legalize 
cannabis. States across the country are 
leading the way and demonstrating 
how to safely, responsibly, and effec-
tively regulate cannabis for medicinal 
and recreational use. 
Mr. Speaker, the MORE Act will de-
criminalize marijuana by removing it 
from the Controlled Substances Act 
and apply retroactively to prior and 
pending marijuana-related convictions. 
The bill will also require Federal 
courts to expunge prior convictions 
and require courts to consider resen-
tencing hearings for those still under 
supervision. 
The MORE Act will not fix all of the 
injustices caused by the obsolete and 
ineffective approach of the Federal 
Government towards cannabis, but it is 
a good and long-overdue start. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to side with justice and side 
with common sense to support this rule 
and the underlying legislation. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), one of our 
former colleagues on the House Budget 
Committee, currently the leader of the 
Republican side of the House Com-
mittee on Rules. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
very good friend from Georgia for 
yielding. 
Normally, when I come down to this 
floor, it is to debate the rule with my 
good friend, the distinguished chair-
man of the Committee on Rules, and it 
is to disagree with the legislation, in 
many cases. And at least that is true: 
I am opposed to the rule and opposed to 
the underlying legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, the real purpose that I 
am here today is something that my 
friend from Georgia referred to oft too 
fleetingly in his opening comments, 
and that is that this may be his last 
appearance managing a rule of the 
floor of the House. 
Now, I had the good fortune to serve 
in Congress throughout my friend’s dis-
tinguished 10-year career. We served, as 
he said, on the Committee on Budget 
together. We have had the opportunity 
to serve on both the majority and the 
minority on the Committee on Rules 
together. I was very proud to be a 
member of the Republican Study Com-
mittee—still am—during his tenure as 
our chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to say, probably 
something that my good friend, the 
chairman, will agree with, we regret 
very much that my friend has made the 
decision to leave Congress and go pur-
sue—and, I am sure, successfully— 
other things. 
We regret it because ROB WOODALL 
has been, throughout his 10 years, a 
Member’s Member, a person whom I 
have never heard say one ill word 
about anyone on either side, even while 
vigorously disagreeing with that per-
son; a person who has made us proud 
with the civility and the decency with 
which he has conducted his office and 
discharged his duties; somebody that I 
think everyone on the Committee on 
Rules not only likes and admires, but 
considers an invaluable part of the 
Committee on Rules because he man-
ages to make his points and bring out 
the best in our committee and, again, 
do so in a way that is always civil, that 
is always appropriate, and, frankly, 
that is quite often humorous and dif-
fuses difficult situations. 
If we had more Members in the 
United States House of Representatives 
like ROB WOODALL, we would be a bet-
ter body than we are—and I think both 
sides would agree on that. He knows 
how to conduct debate and argument. 
He knows the process. He knows how to 
work through the process in a civil 
manner. I have seen him do it in the 
majority. I have seen him do it in the 
minority.

I could not be prouder of him and the 
service he has rendered to this institu-
tion. I could not be, frankly, sorrier 
about losing a colleague who I think 
has contributed each and every day. 
Now, ROB was the chief of staff, Mr. 
Speaker, before he came here, to one of 
our predecessors, John Linder, who 
also was a member of the Committee 
on Rules. So he came to this com-
mittee really understanding how it 
works, much like the chairman, who 
had a very similar career pattern him-
self, working as a staffer then coming 
on and now, obviously, rising to the 
preeminent position on the committee 
as our distinguished chairman. He has 
seen a lot of Members work through 
this process as well, just as I have, and 
I suspect he values my friend, even 
though he is on the other side, as deep-
ly as I do. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, for 
the record, to my friend, ROB: We are 
going to miss you. We are going to 
miss you on the committee. But much 
more importantly, this institution is 
going to miss you. It is going to miss 
your civility. It is going to miss your 
decency. It is going to miss your indus-
try. It is going to miss the manner in 
which you represent all of us to your 
constituents and, frankly, when you 
speak on this floor to the people of the 
United States of America. You have 
every reason to be proud of the career 
that you have built here. You could 
never be as proud of your career as all 
of us are of you and the manner in 
which you have conducted yourself. 
My friend, this may be the last rule; 
although, I have got to tell you, if I 
can sneak you in one more time, I 
would. It is like we are losing, I think, 
our best pitcher, and if I can find one 
more game to stick him in, believe me, 
I will. But I want to tell you how much 
I admire you, how much I like you, 
how much I revere your career, how 
much I will miss you as a Member and 
a friend. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with 
the remarks of the distinguished rank-
ing member, Mr. COLE. 
We are going to miss you, ROB, and 
this may be my final opportunity to be 
able to yield to you during a rules de-
bate. The end of Congress is obviously 
rapidly approaching, and you have de-
cided to retire from Congress after a 
very distinguished career. We have 
spent countless hours not only up in 
the Committee on Rules, but together 
on this floor debating many conten-
tious issues. My distinguished friend 
from Georgia is always very focused, 
and he is always right on message and 
he is really quite impressive. 
Mr. Speaker, every once in a while, 
my mother watches these proceedings, 
and she will always say: You know, 
that WOODALL guy, he is a very good 
debater. 
And I always say: Well, what about 
me? I mean, do you have anything nice 
to say about your son? 
But the bottom line is I have had 
some of my best fights with you, and 
we have disagreed on a lot of issues, 
but we have disagreed without being 
disagreeable. 
The Committee on Rules has to deal 
with a lot of contentious issues. We 
have dealt with our share of conten-
tious issues in this last Congress, but I 
have really taken great comfort and 
great inspiration by the example of 
you, Mr. WOODALL and Mr. COLE and 
others who understand the incredible 
nature and the incredible majesty of 
this institution that we get to serve in. 
So even among these contentious de-
bates, you have never, ever drawn us 
down. It has always been in a way that 
is respectful and that honors your con-
victions and your beliefs. 
We have been together early in the 
morning; we have been together in the 
middle of the afternoon, late at night. 
We meet a lot in the Committee on 
Rules, but Mr. WOODALL’s good nature 
and his sense of humor, whether it is 
intentional or unintentional, makes it 
a little more interesting and, I dare 
say, makes it a lot more fun. 
So I want to take this opportunity to 
thank you for the many years of distin-
guished service, both your near decade 
of service as a Member of Congress and 
before that, as Mr. COLE pointed out, 
your service working for Congressman 
John Linder, who was also on the Com-
mittee on Rules. 
You have brought with you some in-
credible people as well. I see your long-
time Committee on Rules staffer Janet 
Rossi on the floor here today. She is 
here to honor your service, as well as 
the others who are here today. And I 
just want to thank her for all of her 
work in the Committee on Rules as 
well over these years. 
I always think it is really hard to be 
a staff member and work for us on the 
Committee on Rules because you have 
to listen to all of us go on forever and 
ever and ever. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just close with 
this, and that is I think you and I come 
from different parts of the country and 
we have very different points of view 
on our politics, but to me, politics 
should be about conviction, not about 
political opportunism or flip-flopping 
with whatever way the prevailing 
winds are going. 
What I have always admired about 
you is that you feel strongly about 
what you believe in. You know what 
you believe in and you fight for your 
convictions, whether it is popular or 
not popular. And I agree with Mr. COLE 
when he said that this institution 
would be better served if we had more 
Members like you. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank 
you, and I hope you come by the Com-
mittee on Rules next time you come 
back to Washington, and maybe if I get 
lost and I am in Georgia, I will stop by 
your firm and we can reminisce. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts as chair of the Committee on 
Rules, and I collectively thank the 
Committee on Rules for its diligent 
work on the MORE Act, and that is 
H.R. 3884. 
Let me, as well, thank JERRY NAD-
LER, chairman of the Committee on the 
Judiciary, for his great work and, of 
course, two outstanding members, BAR-
BARA LEE and EARL BLUMENAUER, for 
their consistent and persistent deter-
mination. 
Mr. Speaker, this morning I spoke to 
a representative of the law enforce-
ment community, and I indicated to 
him that we are about to move forward 
on the decriminalizing of marijuana at 
the Federal level, eliminating, feder-
ally, the criminalization of marijuana 
and cannabis. I indicated that it was 
not to undermine law enforcement and 
not to promote drug use but, in es-
sence, to bring about justice and to 
provide for the right kind of roadway 
for what over a majority of Americans, 
Republicans and Democrats, want. 
It is an important legislative initia-
tive. It provides a vehicle for sales tax 
and a vehicle that allows businesses in 
the marijuana business to be able to 
bank legally. It provides for a reinvest-
ment program, an opportunity grant 
program, and, as well, an expungement 
program governed by Federal courts. 
b 1430 
It ensures that there are no sales 
made to those under 21. It deals with 
substance abuse. This is a real step for-
ward in bringing America together, and 
I know that my colleagues tomorrow 
on the floor of the House will recognize 
that is what we are doing. 
As many people know, the States 
that have decriminalized can continue; 
those who have not can continue their 
laws as well. 
So I ask my colleagues to support 
H.R. 3884 when it comes to the floor. 
Let us do it in unity. 
I, too, want to take the opportunity, 
very briefly. Mr. WOODALL, I think we 
have seen each other quite frequently, 
either on this floor in debate or in the 
Rules Committee. Let me echo the gen-
erosity and cordialness of your per-
sistent intellect in challenging each 
and every one of us who came to make 
our case. That is all we can do as 
Americans and Representatives, is to 
make our case. 
I join you. Let us work together for a 
COVID–19 relief package and have that 
as our legacy as we leave this place. 
But I wanted to make sure you knew 
that Texans appreciate your great 
leadership. Georgians and Texans have 
a good relationship. Congratulations to 
you. Thank you for your service. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ar-
izona (Mrs. LESKO), a member of the 
Judiciary Committee and the Rules 
Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, first, be-
fore I talk about the bill at hand, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6065 
December 3, 2020 
want to say just what an honor it has 
been serving with you on the Rules 
Committee, Mr. WOODALL. 
You 
know, 
I 
didn’t 
know 
Mr. 
WOODALL, really, before I served on the 
Rules Committee with him, and I found 
him to be very witty, a very good de-
bater as well. You do it in such a nice 
way. You really win the debates, but 
you do it with a smile, and you do it in 
a friendly way. I really appreciate the 
way you conduct yourself and how you 
actually win arguments, but you are 
very friendly about it. 
I don’t know what your future holds, 
but I wish you all of the best. You are 
extremely talented, and it really is an 
honor to serve with you. 
Mr. Speaker, let me talk about the 
bill. I find it crazy, quite frankly, that 
the American people and small busi-
nesses are hurting, because of the 
COVID crisis, and they need COVID re-
lief, and we are not concentrating on a 
bipartisan COVID relief stimulus pack-
age right now that will actually be 
signed into law. 
I find it just incredulous that, in-
stead, my Democratic colleagues are 
focusing on legalizing marijuana na-
tionwide. 
Sometimes I think that the world is 
turned upside down, when you have a 
State—I think Oregon—that bans plas-
tic straws but legalizes cocaine and 
heroin. It is just insane to me and I 
think to a majority of my constitu-
ents, whether they be Republican, 
Independent, or Democrat, quite frank-
ly. 
It is interesting to me—I sit on the 
Rules Committee and the Judiciary 
Committee—that on a lot of these to-
bacco bills that the Democrats have 
been promoting, it says, okay, we don’t 
want flavored tobacco. But yet on 
marijuana, they don’t seem to care 
about that. They don’t care. 
In this bill, there is nothing about we 
shouldn’t have flavored edibles or 
candies or brownies that would be en-
ticing to children. As far as I know, 
that is not in this bill at all. Yet, we 
want to ban that with tobacco. This 
makes absolutely no sense to me and 
no sense, I think, to the American pub-
lic. 
At a time when parents are trying to 
get their children back into school 
with an in-person option, because their 
children are falling so far behind be-
cause of the lockdowns of schools, here 
we are with a bill that will make it 
easier for these same children to get 
marijuana products. 
I am sorry. I just don’t get it. I don’t 
understand the motivation. I am abso-
lutely opposed to this bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my 
good friend from Arizona. I am not sure 
she was on the floor earlier when I an-
nounced that, finally, MITCH MCCON-
NELL seems willing to want to nego-
tiate a deal, not only on an omnibus 
bill, but he seems to be interested in 
talking about how we can get a COVID 
relief bill. This notwithstanding the 
fact that for the last over six months, 
he has held everything up. We have ac-
tually sent two major COVID relief 
bills over to the Senate. So I am hope-
ful. I am going to try to be hopeful 
that, in fact, this is for real. 
I would also say that the focus of this 
bill is on unfair, unequal, and racist 
drug laws. I mean, as I said in my open-
ing statement, if people want to know 
what systemic racism is, look at how 
our drug laws are enforced in this 
country. 
If you look like me and you were 
caught with a small amount of can-
nabis, you would probably get off with 
a very, very light sentence, if any-
thing. But if the color of your skin 
were black or brown, it is a whole dif-
ferent story. 
I mean, our system of drug laws is 
what systemic racism is in this coun-
try. No matter what you think about, 
you know, States legalizing marijuana 
or not legalizing marijuana, or what-
ever, I think we all ought to be com-
mitted to making sure there is equal 
justice under our laws. 
People’s lives were ruined because of 
the color of their skin and how our 
drug laws were enforced. It is wrong. 
The time has long since passed for us 
to do something. That is what this is 
all about. 
So we will work on the COVID relief 
bill, and I hope that MITCH MCCONNELL 
is sincere in what he said to Speaker 
PELOSI. I believe we will come together 
on an omnibus bill to keep our Govern-
ment running, but we also need to ad-
dress issues like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s comments 
and his courtesy. 
Listening to my colleague from Ari-
zona sort of made my head hurt. This 
legislation does not legalize cannabis 
across the country. What it does is it 
stops the Federal Government from 
interfering with what States have de-
cided to do. 
No small amount of irony, her State 
just approved legalizing cannabis. And 
this legislation would prevent the Fed-
eral Government from interfering with 
what her voters decided. 
I have been waiting for this historic 
moment for a long time. I was in the 
Oregon legislature when we were the 
first State to decriminalize cannabis. I 
have 
been 
working 
from 
Bangor, 
Maine, to Santa Barbara ever since 
trying to end the failed prohibition of 
cannabis. 
It is happening today, because it has 
been demanded by the voters, by facts, 
by the momentum behind this issue. 
It is now a $17 billion industry. It em-
ploys 250,000 people. It is powerful in 
terms of economic development. 
More important, as my friend from 
Massachusetts said, this is an oppor-
tunity to strike a blow against the 
failed war on drugs that has literally 
destroyed hundreds of thousands of 
young Black lives. Black people use 
cannabis no more frequently than 
Whites, but they are arrested about 
four more times, and in some parts of 
the country, it is much, much greater. 
We are still arresting or citing 600,000 
people a year for something that the 
majority 
of 
Americans 
now 
think 
should be legal. That is why the voters 
in this country took it into their own 
hands. That is why today, 99 percent of 
the American population have some ac-
cess to legalized cannabis. 
This will help us set up a system 
moving forward. It will stop the inter-
ference by the Federal Government for 
research, for banking, for being able to 
promote an opportunity to make this 
work properly and not interfere with 
what voters in States have decided to 
do in the best interest of their public. 
I really appreciate our being at this 
point. The legislation was carefully 
crafted over the course of two years 
with 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
It 
comes on the heels of other legislation, 
like the Safe Banking Act, and we have 
research legislation that is moving for-
ward. Five States, including Arizona, 
just approved it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a historic mo-
ment. It is an important step towards 
rationalizing the policy, towards racial 
justice, towards health, so that maybe 
the parents in my neighborhood don’t 
have to formulate cannabis medicine 
to stop their babies from being tor-
tured by extreme seizure disorder. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
YARMUTH). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
that is why a number of States that 
haven’t yet legalized cannabis have 
passed legislation to legalize that. 
This is an opportunity for us to right 
this historic wrong. This is an oppor-
tunity for us to turn the page and move 
forward without Federal interference 
so that we are not outsourcing the 
product development to Canada or 
Israel. It is an opportunity for us to re-
alize the promise while we realize the 
notion of racial justice. 
I urge, in the strongest possible 
terms, for my colleagues to get in step 
with the vast majority of the American 
public, with what has happened at the 
State level, to be able to make this 
safe, affordable, and healthy, some-
thing that will make a big difference 
for people across the country. It is 
something for which time is long over-
due, and I herald the day and hope that 
my colleagues will vote for it. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, if we 
defeat the previous question, I will 
amend the rule to allow for consider-
ation of a bill that will assist our 
struggling small businesses as we enter 
the winter months and folks are antici-
pating increased risks of having to 
shut their doors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6066 
December 3, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD 
immediately prior to the vote on the 
previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), the ranking Republican 
on the Small Business Committee, a 
gentleman who has had great experi-
ence 
bringing 
together 
bipartisan 
groups in an effort to make a difference 
for families back home. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
reiterate the comments of the previous 
speaker on our side, the gentlewoman 
from Arizona. Mr. WOODALL has made 
great contributions to this body in the 
decade that he has served here. 
He happens to be a classmate of 
mine. We came together in 2010. That 
was his first time as a Member of Con-
gress. It was my second time around, 
because I lost back in ‘08 after being 
here 14 years. So I have seen Mr. 
WOODALL in operation here for the last 
decade. He has done a tremendous job 
on behalf of not only his constituents 
but for the people of this great Nation. 
I want to thank him for his dedication 
and hard work for the people that he 
represents and for the people of this 
Nation overall. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I spoke on 
this very floor urging action on behalf 
of our Nation’s 31 million small busi-
nesses, as the ranking member of the 
House Small Business Committee, for-
merly the Chair of that committee for 
two terms. 
I said then that there was no better 
way to celebrate Small Business Satur-
day than to deliver much-needed aid, 
again, to the small restaurants and 
manufacturers and shops that are 
many of them just hanging on by a 
thread. 
That assistance could come in the 
form of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, the PPP. That program has sup-
ported over 50 million jobs across this 
great Nation. That is over 50 million 
people who didn’t have to worry about 
how they were going to pay their bills 
or how they were going to support 
their families, because of this bipar-
tisan program that we passed here in 
this body. 
b 1445 
Unfortunately, that program stopped 
accepting applications almost 4 months 
ago, back on August 8, but still has 
over $130 billion remaining in its cof-
fers. Millions of small firms across the 
country have utilized the PPP program 
to keep their shops open, to keep pay-
ing their employees, and to keep serv-
ing their communities. 
To me, it seems like common sense 
to open the program back up. After all, 
it was initially crafted, as I mentioned, 
in a bipartisan way, Republicans and 
Democrats actually working together. 
It was bicameral, the House and the 
Senate working together, and then the 
administration, obviously, signing it 
into law. And that program has proven 
to be overwhelmingly successful and 
saved so many jobs all over this Na-
tion, including in my district back in 
Cincinnati. 
So I introduced a bill that would do 
just that and provide targeted assist-
ance to small businesses that truly 
still need help. Unfortunately, the 
Democratic leadership in this body has 
blocked efforts to even have a vote on 
this legislation, not just once or twice 
or three times or a dozen times, but 40 
times, 4–0. Forty times the Democratic 
leadership has blocked consideration or 
having a vote on this. 
Because the Democrats would also 
support this. You would have Demo-
crats and Republicans, once again, 
working together and passing this and 
helping small business people all across 
the country and, most importantly, the 
people and families that are supported 
by them. 
As we all know, many small busi-
nesses are still uncertain about their 
future. Many are on the verge of clos-
ing their doors permanently. If that 
continues to happen, communities all 
across our great Nation will be abso-
lutely devastated. 
This should have been dealt with 
months ago. But apparently our Demo-
cratic leadership feels it is more urgent 
to vote on legislation to legalize pot 
and to deal with lions and tigers than 
they do to help those small businesses 
that really need the help. That is just 
a shame. 
Today, if we defeat the previous ques-
tion, we make improvements to the 
Paycheck Protection Program, and fi-
nally get additional targeted relief to 
the small businesses all across this 
country that are counting on us. Let’s 
not let them down. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the 
gentleman from Ohio, I think we all 
know what needs to happen, and that is 
that the Senate majority leader needs 
to be willing to come to the table and 
sit down and work out a deal. 
We heard today that the Speaker has 
had a constructive conversation with 
him. Hopefully we will end up with 
something that, quite frankly, is going 
to help a lot more people than what the 
gentleman is suggesting here. What we 
do know is that nobody has been work-
ing harder than the Speaker of the 
House to try to get a COVID relief bill. 
She met around the clock with Sec-
retary Mnuchin, with anybody in this 
administration who would be willing to 
come to the table. 
Our problem has been the Senate. 
Now, that may be changing today. I 
hope it is. But I would also say that we 
have sent over two major COVID relief 
bills, which, unfortunately, the gen-
tleman voted against, which would 
help not just small businesses, but help 
our schools, help our first responders; 
help with PPE for people who, quite 
frankly, are running short right now as 
we see another surge; help support our 
cities and towns that are struggling; 
and help support our restaurants. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I think about how many 
times the gentleman from Ohio has 
been down here to do exactly what he 
has just done, which is to say: I have a 
bill that is ready to go, a bill that I 
know will get bipartisan support here 
on the floor of the House, a bill my 
friends in the Senate will be anxious to 
move, and a bill that I know the Presi-
dent will put his signature on. 
I appreciate his efforts in that, and I 
know it is not a Johnny-come-lately 
commitment to these struggling busi-
nesses. I remember when we were sit-
ting down trying to work out that very 
first package in the spring, and the 
very productive role that the gen-
tleman from Ohio played in bringing 
people together to get that done. 
You remember that, Mr. Speaker. 
We didn’t have a bunch of debates on 
the floor of the House, a bunch of pre-
vious questions to defeat, a bunch of 
amendments designed to confuse or dis-
tract. No. We worked it all out to-
gether, both sides. Both sides, politi-
cally here in the House, both sides bi-
camerally here in the Congress, both 
ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
Why? 
Because we all felt that sense of ur-
gency to get something done, and we 
did it. 
Mr. Speaker, I tell constituents back 
home that the thing most freshmen are 
going to learn in the first 6 months 
that they didn’t know when they got 
here is how hardworking and conscien-
tious all of their colleagues turn out to 
be. All you see are these faces on FOX 
News or MSNBC fussing with one an-
other, but the truth is that behind the 
scenes it is a very powerful orchestra 
of men and women trying to get the 
people’s business done. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my 
friend from Massachusetts, first and 
probably most importantly, I wish he 
was not chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee. I wish a Republican was chair-
man of the Rules Committee because 
the American people felt in their wis-
dom that Republicans should be run-
ning this institution. There are a lot of 
reasons why it didn’t happen. I am not 
here to place blame on that today. 
But I will say to the gentleman that 
if it cannot be a Republican who leads 
the Rules Committee, how pleased I am 
that the gentleman has led the Rules 
Committee, because his love for this 
institution far transcends whatever the 
political passions of the day are. 
The Rules Committee has had to do a 
lot of difficult decisionmaking in this 
Congress, Mr. Speaker. I wish we did 
not have proxy voting in this institu-
tion today. We do. That is the product 
of a Rules Committee effort. In many

cases, the effort of the wisdom of Sol-
omon trying to figure out how to pro-
tect an institution and all of its prac-
tices, where we are just caretakers of 
this institution, going to pass it on to 
the next generation, while we have had 
to grapple with some challenges that 
we never anticipated grappling with, 
and hopefully will never have to grap-
ple with again. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts has brought an incred-
ible amount of not just leadership, but 
a great amount of love for this institu-
tion, and for the members of his com-
mittee. And I don’t want to embarrass 
the gentleman by pointing out some of 
these circumstances, but I can go 
through a list of times this year where 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
stood not on behalf of the Democratic 
Caucus, but on behalf of the Rules 
Committee against some other under-
currents in the United States Congress, 
to stand up on behalf of his 13 members 
and the work that we have to get done 
there together. That’s never an easy 
thing to do, and I want to tell the gen-
tleman how much I appreciate and no-
tice those efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, to do the really big 
things that we all know need to get 
done, not the least of which are on the 
committee you and I serve on, the 
Budget Committee, it takes strong 
men and women, men and women of 
conviction, but also men and women of 
faith, not just faith in their Lord, but 
faith in this institution that we can 
bring out the very best in one another 
as opposed to bringing out the very 
worst. 
Far too often we have bills like the 
one before us today that could be bills 
that we were talking about with one 
voice. 
When is the right time to decide that 
edible 
marijuana 
for 
our 
children 
should be banned at the Federal level? 
Is it after 50 States have grappled with 
these decisions? Is it before? 
Well, we have made that decision in 
terms of alcohol. We have made that 
decision in terms of tobacco. It seems 
like the easy time to make that would 
be now. But we have not made that de-
cision in the underlying bill. We have 
not made those amendments in order. 
Mr. Speaker, I said at the beginning, 
and I will say here at the end: I am 
glad we are taking up this legislation. 
It offends me, as one who loves the 
law, that we ask Federal law enforce-
ment officers to enforce one set of rules 
while the State and local law enforce-
ment officers may be enforcing a com-
pletely different set of rules. It offends 
me that we would put Federal law en-
forcement officers in harm’s way for an 
industry that, as my friend from Mas-
sachusetts pointed out, is a multibil-
lion-dollar cash cow legalized by State 
jurisdictions across the country. 
I am troubled by having two sets of 
laws in this country. Laws we choose 
to follow and laws we choose not to fol-
low. This is the institution to solve 
that. Having this discussion for the 
first time is a step in the right direc-
tion. Having this conversation end 
today, because it is a partisan package 
that is not well thought through serves 
none of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I would again encourage 
my colleagues to defeat the rule so we 
don’t go down that road. 
Mr. Speaker, my friend from Massa-
chusetts mentioned Janet Rossi on my 
team. I have Nick Scoufaras on my 
team, sitting beside me. We all are sur-
rounded by great people that we get to 
work with day in and day out. 
When you go to work for a member 
on the Rules Committee, that means 
you will work early, and you will work 
late, and you can work often. It is an 
amazing opportunity that we have to 
serve in this institution. It is also an 
amazing opportunity that folks that 
we get to surround ourselves with have 
to serve in this institution. 
There is no more humbling space 
than having someone who can do any-
thing they want to with his or her life 
say, Rob, I will join you; I will sit here 
with you; we will work side by side and 
we will accomplish things together. 
While I appreciate the very heartfelt 
comments from my friend from Massa-
chusetts and my friend from Okla-
homa, one thing that occurs to me on 
my way out the door is how much less 
one would be able to do without all the 
greatness that folks are surrounded by. 
Mr. Speaker, I get to thank Nick be-
cause he is here. I can thank Janet be-
cause she is here. But I would just say 
to each of my colleagues who are here, 
we are all so lucky folks are sur-
rounding us in order to help us all lift 
this great Nation up. We often get 
sucked into the drumbeat of whatever 
the activity of the day is if you have 
not had an opportunity to recognize 
the greatness of those staffers around 
you, and occasionally even the Mem-
bers around you, even those who sit on 
the other side of the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a lot to be con-
cerned about in America today, but a 
lot of opportunities for optimism. And 
many of those opportunities sit here, 
and sit here, and sit there, and sit here. 
I am grateful to be a part of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
so that we can bring the Chabot legis-
lation to the floor. If we can’t defeat 
the previous question, defeat the rule 
so that we can go back and make sure 
all voices are heard. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Georgia for his kind words. I al-
most feel like I want to yield him more 
time to have the compliments keep 
coming. 
The bottom line is that even though 
we disagree on a lot of issues, and 
sometimes in our debates you make me 
want to pull the remaining last two 
strands of hair out of my head, the rea-
son why I sometimes feel that way is 
because you are passionate, you are 
smart, and you are effective. You have 
served your constituency incredibly 
well, and you have served this institu-
tion incredibly well. 
Mr. Speaker, going back to what Mr. 
COLE
said at the very beginning, I 
think this place would benefit from 
more people of your caliber. And even 
though you would like to demote me to 
ranking member instead of chairman, I 
am still going to miss you, and I thank 
you for your friendship. You are a good 
man, and we are going to miss you a 
lot. 
b 1500 
Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill de-
serves to be considered and passed. As 
I said earlier, nearly 60 percent of the 
American public supports this bill. A 
majority of Democrats and a majority 
of Republicans throughout the Nation 
want this bill passed. 
Prior Republican Congresses were ap-
parently fine with turning a deaf ear to 
the will of the people. They blocked 
virtually all cannabis-related measures 
from getting a vote on the floor year 
after year. 
But this majority is not. We believe 
in listening to the people we represent. 
We believe in actually doing something 
about the war on drugs. Its failures 
have been staring us in the face for a 
very long time. 
Americans came together in record 
numbers 
following 
George 
Floyd’s 
death to fight against systemic racism. 
Combating that means, among other 
things, reforming our policies toward 
cannabis. These laws have been used to 
disproportionately lock up people of 
color for decades. It is past time we 
showed the moral courage to do some-
thing about it. 
This is a historic moment. Let us 
seize this chance. Let us pass this bill. 
I urge everyone to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
previous question, and I urge a vote of 
‘‘yes’’ on the rule. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1244 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8265) to amend the Small Business Act and 
the CARES Act to establish a program for 
second draw loans and make other modifica-
tions to the paycheck protection program, 
and for other purposes. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Small Business; and (2) one 
motion to recommit. 
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8265. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would 
like to take a moment to recognize my 
good friend and colleague, Ranking 
Member CHABOT. Mr. CHABOT has led 
this committee with me for years. To-
gether, we have worked in a bipartisan 
manner to pass legislation that will 
help entrepreneurs across the country 
launch and grow their small busi-
nesses. 
STEVE has been an absolute pleasure 
to work with. Not only is he results- 
oriented, but he is strongly committed 
to bipartisanship and finding common 
ground. While we do not always agree, 
Ranking Member CHABOT has always 
respected our views and the need to 
work together to do the right thing for 
America’s small businesses. 
The bills we are bringing to the floor 
today represent our committee’s long 
tradition of collaboration. 
Turning to the legislation now, I rise 
in support of the bill before us today, 
H.R. 7903, which would codify the 
SBA’s Community Advantage Loan 
Program. 
Initially launched in 2011 as a pilot 
program, Community Advantage pro-
vides 7(a) loan guarantees to nonprofit 
lenders to make loans up to $250,000 to 
small businesses in underserved mar-
kets. 
As we all know, businesses in under-
served areas have historically strug-
gled to access capital through conven-
tional credit markets. This is particu-
larly true for minority-owned small 
businesses. 
According to the Minority Business 
Development Agency, the loan denial 
rates for minority-owned firms were 
about three times higher compared to 
those of nonminority-owned firms with 
gross receipts under $500,000. 
To that end, the Community Advan-
tage program partners with SBA’s cer-
tified development companies, SBA 
microlenders, and community develop-
ment financial institutions, or CDFIs, 
all of which have deep relationships in 
the neighborhoods and can expand ac-
cess to capital in these areas. 
The Community Advantage program 
reaches significantly more women and 
minorities than traditional 7(a) loan 
programs, which will be critical to 
helping these groups that were hit es-
pecially hard by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
To fill gaps in lending, it is impera-
tive that we empower the community 
lenders with the strongest relation-
ships in these areas. We can accomplish 
this by passing the bill before us today 
to bring stability and long-needed rec-
ognition to a program that has success-
fully delivered over $770 million in cap-
ital since its inception. 
I thank Ms. CHU and Mr. SPANO for 
working in a bipartisan manner on this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote to all of my colleagues in the 
House, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7903, as 
amended. This is a bill to improve and 
authorize the SBA’s Community Ad-
vantage Loan Program for 5 years. 
Mr. Speaker, before I get into the 
business of the day, I would like to 
mention that, with the passage of these 
four bills today, our committee has 
produced 
35 
individual 
bipartisan 
pieces of legislation that have passed 
the House just this Congress. We have 
had similar numbers the previous two 
Congresses, as well. That is an uncom-
mon occurrence in a time of divided 
government. 
The reason we have been so success-
ful in improving the programs that 
benefit America’s more than 30 million 
small businesses is the leadership and 
the bipartisanship of our chairwoman, 
NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ. 
Now, this is my swan song, so to 
speak, here as the ranking member of 
the committee, as I am term-limited 
and, therefore, unable to continue serv-
ing in that role. I have had the pleas-
ure of being on the Small Business 
Committee—I am on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee and Judiciary Com-
mittee, as well—for 12 terms now, rep-
resenting Ohio’s First Congressional 
District. I have also been fortunate to 
have been the ranking member two of 
those terms and the chair of the com-
mittee two of those terms, as well. 
Again, that is why I am term-limited. 
In each of those terms that I have 
spent in a leadership position on the 
committee, my counterpart was Chair-
woman 
or 
Ranking 
Member 
VELA´ ZQUEZ. She has remained a valued

friend and a reliable partner to do the 
things that we needed to do to help the 
Nation’s small businesses. I sincerely 
thank her for the partnership that we 
have forged over the years. 
We share a common bond of wanting 
to do everything in our power to help 
America’s small businesses, and we 
have consistently been able to put par-
tisan politics aside and work together 
to support that goal. So, again, I thank 
her for her willingness to work with 
my staff and me over those years, and 
I hope and trust that they will be able 
to continue that relationship with my 
replacement, and I think that will hap-
pen. 
Finally, I mentioned staff before. I 
want to thank the longtime Demo-
cratic Small Business Committee staff-
ers Melissa Jung, Justin Pelletier, 
Naveen Parmar, and Ellen Harrington 
for their extraordinary commitment to 
bipartisanship over the years, regard-
less of who was chair or who was the 
ranking member. Again, on that com-
mittee, we have worked together for 
many years now. 
Now, to the business at hand. When 
traditional and conventional lending is 
out of reach for the Nation’s smallest 
businesses, they have the opportunity 
to turn to a number of the SBA’s gov-
ernment guaranteed lending programs. 
For approximately 10 years, the SBA 
has been operating a Community Ad-
vantage pilot program that combines 
access to capital and technical assist-
ance. The legislation before us today 
makes structural changes and improve-
ments in the program and authorizes it 
for 5 years. 
With oversight and reporting require-
ments in place, this program will con-
tinue to provide access to capital and 
consistency to the Nation’s job cre-
ators who truly need assistance. 
I thank the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SPANO) and the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. JUDY CHU) for working 
in a bipartisan manner on behalf of the 
Nation’s smallest firms. They have 
both worked together on this and pre-
vious legislation, both of them, in the 
spirit of bipartisanship on that com-
mittee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7903, which was 
favorably reported out of the com-
mittee via voice vote, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
JUDY CHU), the sponsor of the bill and 
the chair of the Subcommittee on In-
vestigations, Oversight and Regula-
tions. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of my bill, H.R. 7903, which would au-
thorize 
the 
Community 
Advantage 
Loan Program for 5 years. To help our 
struggling economy, we need a bipar-
tisan bill that gets money to those who 
need it. 
This bill, which I am proud to have 
introduced with my colleague, Con-
gressman ROSS SPANO, does just that 
by providing statutory authorization 
to the Community Advantage program, 
already a proven and successful pilot 
program. 
Thanks to Community Advantage, 
underserved small businesses, which 
typically have the hardest time access-
ing loans, can gain access to affordable 
financing 
and 
technical 
assistance 
from mission-based, primarily non-
profit lenders through SBA’s 7(a) loan 
guarantee. That means more money in 
more communities to keep our busi-
nesses operating. This is something we 
need now more than ever. 
The Community Advantage program 
was first established almost 10 years 
ago as a pilot at the Small Business 
Administration with the goal of deliv-
ering capital to the hard-to-reach busi-
nesses that need under $250,000 in fi-
nancing to grow. Since 2011, the pro-
gram has facilitated over $850 million 
in loans averaging $140,000 each. Com-
pare that to the average 7(a) loan of 
$530,000, and it is clear Community Ad-
vantage is meeting a small business 
need that is unfilled by the traditional 
7(a) program. 
It has also made a big impact in my 
district, where businesses have re-
ceived nearly $10 million in Commu-
nity Advantage loans. That includes 
businesses like Unincorporated Coffee 
Roasters in Altadena, California, which 
received a Community Advantage loan 
last summer. This business had been in 
operation for under 2 years, but their 
Community Advantage loan allowed 
them to expand into the space next 
door and open a second company to 
roast their own coffee beans for the 
wholesale market. 
b 1515 
They have even added jobs and con-
tinued to grow during the pandemic. 
That is what can happen when we 
make small business loans just a little 
less difficult to access. And it is an ex-
perience shared by businesses across 
the country. 
Last year, I chaired a hearing in the 
Subcommittee on Investigations, Over-
sight and Regulations to examine the 
Community Advantage program. We 
heard 
from 
borrowers 
and 
lenders 
about the ways that Community Ad-
vantage has closed the credit gap for 
underserved businesses. 
Because of their focus on economic 
and community development, the mis-
sion-based lenders that facilitate Com-
munity Advantage loans can leverage 
their strong relationships within the 
community to provide accessibility, 
guidance, and assistance to the busi-
nesses that too often find themselves 
on the margins without the ability to 
access capital from traditional banks. 
As a result, Community Advantage is 
able to reach far more businesses 
owned by people of color, women, and 
veterans than traditional 7(a) loans. 
This is a proven model, and we can 
see further evidence in the response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. When the Pay-
check Protection Program, or PPP, 
first launched at the start of April, tra-
ditional lenders prioritized their larg-
est and longstanding clients, making it 
difficult for underserved businesses to 
even submit an application for assist-
ance. 
To address this problem, Congress es-
tablished a set-aside lending authority 
for community financial institutions 
like certified development companies, 
microloan intermediaries, and commu-
nity development financial institu-
tions, many of which are already cer-
tified Community Advantage lenders. 
The result was a success, as these non-
traditional lenders were able to reach 
the underserved businesses and, to-
gether, deliver over 141,000 PPP loans 
totaling more than $8.5 billion. 
Now it is time to build on that suc-
cess. This legislation before us today 
includes 
measures, 
with 
bipartisan 
agreement, to make the program even 
stronger. It will expand the definition 
of ‘‘underserved businesses’’ to explic-
itly include those owned by people of 
color and those located in declared dis-
aster areas, and it will increase the 
percentage of loans that lenders must 
make in underserved markets from 60 
to 75 percent of their portfolios. It will 
also allow SBA to make loans up to 
$350,000 on a case-by-case basis. 
With these improvements and the 
long-term certainty afforded by statu-
tory authorization, this bill will make 
the Community Advantage program an 
even more powerful tool for closing the 
credit gap and delivering affordable 
capital to more small businesses. 
With a long and arduous economic re-
covery before us, this bill will help 
countless small businesses rebuild, and 
it will help them to start anew as we 
recover from the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
SPANO for his partnership and Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking Mem-
ber CHABOT for their strong support. I 
also thank the Community Advantage 
lenders and borrowers whose success 
and testimony over the years have 
powerfully made the case for Congress 
to pass this legislation to authorize the 
program. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7903. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO). 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for his service in this body. He has in-
troduced and supported a number of 
pieces of legislation and has worked 
very hard in his leadership position as 
ranking member of the Oversight, In-
vestigations 
and 
Regulations 
Sub-
committee. I thank him for his service 
here. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for 
those kind comments. I appreciate that 
very much. 
I rise today in support of a bill I am 
proud to sponsor, H.R. 7903, legislation 
to improve and authorize the SBA’s 
Community Advantage Loan Program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6072 
December 3, 2020 
Small businesses are the driver of our 
communities, and now, more than ever, 
it is imperative for Congress to support 
them. 
In my home State of Florida, there 
are over 2.5 million small businesses 
employing over 3.5 million Floridians. 
As a former small business owner 
myself and as someone who will be a 
small business owner again very, very 
soon, I understand the sacrifice many 
small business owners make to keep 
their doors open and to meet their pay-
rolls. I know the challenges that they 
face and the grit that it takes for them 
to persevere and the impact that they 
have on our communities. 
Among these challenges for many 
small businesses is acquiring the cap-
ital that is necessary to finance their 
operations. 
Many of the tools available at the 
SBA strive to increase access to capital 
for small businesses that are unable to 
receive it through conventional and 
traditional lending markets. One of 
these tools to support small businesses 
is the SBA’s Community Advantage 
Loan Program, which was launched as 
a pilot program to assist small busi-
nesses in historically underserved and 
rural areas. It targets assistance to 
veteran-owned 
businesses, 
women- 
owned businesses, startups, and under-
served minority communities, all key 
job creators. The combination of finan-
cial and technical assistance has made 
the program a proven game changer for 
many small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU) 
for her bipartisan leadership in pro-
viding strategic improvements to this 
program and to move it from a pilot 
program to an authorized program for 
the next 5 years. 
The improvements included in H.R. 
7903 will ensure the program serves 
businesses truly in need of SBA serv-
ices. Specifically, H.R. 7903 defines the 
program with congressional intent. It 
outlines how Community Advantage 
lenders must operate within the pro-
gram and details loan terms and other 
requirements. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chair-
woman and the ranking member for ad-
vancing this important legislation that 
will strengthen and improve the Com-
munity Advantage Loan Program. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
good bill that deserves our support. 
The SBA’s Community Advantage pro-
gram provides both financial and tech-
nical assistance to our Nation’s small-
est firms. It is a great program that 
has proven results. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in al-
most a decade, Community Advantage 
lenders have delivered over $770 million 
in affordable capital to underserved 
small businesses across America, as-
sisting women- and minority-owned 
businesses that have historically strug-
gled 
to 
secure 
affordable 
capital 
through traditional means, yet new 
lenders are hesitant to participate be-
cause of its pilot status and frequently 
changing rules. 
Today’s bill will remedy these prob-
lems and ultimately grow the CA pro-
gram to deliver more capital to entre-
preneurs who need access to affordable 
capital the most, especially those se-
verely impacted by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
JUDY
CHU) and the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for their efforts in 
crafting a bipartisan bill to codify the 
Community Advantage program. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7903, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 8211, the 504 
Modernization and Small Manufacturer 
Enhancement Act of 2020, a bill that 
makes important improvements to the 
SBA’s 504 Loan Program. 
Over 62 years ago, Congress created 
the 504 Loan Program at SBA to help 
America’s small businesses access af-
fordable, long-term capital needed to 
purchase land, real estate, heavy ma-
chinery, equipment, and other fixed as-
sets. 
The program is a true public-private 
partnership. An SBA-backed Certified 
Development Company provides 40 per-
cent of the financing; a bank or credit 
union provides 50 percent; and the 
small business borrower provides 10 
percent. This structure has proved to 
be extremely successful for all parties 
involved. 
However, earlier this Congress, our 
Investigations, Oversight and Regula-
tions Subcommittee heard from stake-
holders who expressed concerns with 
the loan closing process, specifically 
that delays have caused loans to fall 
through and businesses to lose out on 
affordable financing. 
To that end, Ms. CRAIG
and Mr. 
CHABOT have put forth today’s bill to 
streamline the closing process and 
make compliance easier for CDCs, bor-
rowers, and third-party lenders alike. 
The bill also enhances access to capital 
for small manufacturers by increasing 
the maximum 504. Loan amount for 
small manufacturers from $5.5 million 
to $6.5 million. These changes address 
the issues we have heard in our engage-
ment with CDCs and their borrowers in 
our districts. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. CRAIG and 
Mr. CHABOT for their hard work and ap-
plaud them for their efforts to make bi-
partisan improvements to this valuable 
program. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote to all my colleagues in the House, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 8211, the 504 
Modernization and Small Manufacturer 
Enhancement Act of 2020. 
Fortunately, many of the SBA’s gov-
ernment guaranteed loan programs 
have a strong track record of producing 
results. Included near the top of that 
list is the 504 loan program. 
The SBA’s 504/CDC Loan Program 
provides the Nation’s smallest busi-
nesses with long-term and fixed-rate fi-
nancing. 
Importantly, for a project to qualify 
for this government guarantee loan 
program, certain economic develop-
ment goals must be met, including job 
creation and job retention goals. 
H.R. 8211 modernizes that program by 
expanding the public policy goals to in-
clude businesses with 10 employees or 
less, as well as enhancing the program 
for small manufacturers. 
I would like to thank the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG) for 
working with me in a bipartisan fash-
ion to craft this piece of legislation. 
I would also like to thank the chair-
woman, Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ, once again for 
advancing this legislation that was fa-
vorably reported out of committee 
unanimously; so both Republicans and 
Democrats supporting it. 
I urge my colleagues to support this, 
which provides crucial updates to the 
SBA’s program, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
CRAIG), the sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
8211, the 504 Modernization and Small 
Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 
2020. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member for being an original cosponsor 
of this bill; the chairwoman, for her 
leadership, and to her staff for helping 
me and my constituents throughout 
the 116th Congress. 
Our small businesses are suffering. 
Every day we see a new wave of busi-
nesses closing their doors. Unemploy-
ment numbers are rising, and our econ-
omy is suffering. 
I hear from constituents daily that 
their businesses are on their very last 
leg, and without action to support 
them, they will soon be forced to close. 
These are not simply businesses. These 
are livelihoods, family traditions, and 
priceless contributions to our commu-
nities. 
It is our job, as Members of Congress, 
to support these businesses, ensure 
they survive these troubling times, and 
provide them with multiple avenues to 
succeed. 
In addition to relief, we need to pass 
legislation that provides businesses in 
various industries opportunities for 
growth and access to capital. One way 
we can do this is to build upon the 
Small Business Administration’s suc-
cessful 504 loan program that promotes 
economic development, job creation, 
and retention and expansion of small 
businesses. 
The 504 loan program is designed by 
local certified development companies, 
or CDCs, delivered by those companies, 
which are private, nonprofit corpora-
tions whose entire purpose is to pro-
mote economic development within 
their communities. 
The program backs long-term, fixed- 
rate loans to support investment in 
major fixed assets through a three-part 
partnership with a local lender. 
One year ago, in the Subcommittee 
on Investigation, Oversight, and Regu-
lation hearing, CDC lenders spoke 
about their experiences with this loan 
program and the many issues they 
navigated, we saw areas for improve-
ment. 
One was the lengthy and complex 
loan closing process which caused 
third-party lenders to walk away, 
along with various outdated rules and 
guidelines hindering the financing of 
projects. 
In order for small businesses to take 
advantage of these programs, we must 
listen to this feedback and alter our 
programs accordingly. That is why I 
introduced H.R. 8211. 
This bill would make an array of im-
provements to the 504 program, making 
it more accessible to small businesses 
and ultimately driving economic devel-
opment and growth. 
In a time of economic crisis and un-
employment, we must continue to in-
vest in our small businesses, specifi-
cally small manufacturers, in order to 
promote economic development and 
the creation and retention of good-pay-
ing jobs. We must do everything we can

to support small manufacturers and en-
sure that the SBA programs available 
to them are operating as effectively 
and efficiently as possible. 
In addition, H.R. 8199, the 504 Credit 
Risk Management Improvement Act of 
2020, which is also under floor consider-
ation later today, would further clarify 
provisions in the 504 program, enhanc-
ing its accessibility and effectiveness. 
Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the 
heart of this economy, and with the 
improvements from H.R. 8211 and H.R. 
8199, more small businesses will be able 
to grow and ultimately contribute to 
the economic landscape of not only 
their communities but this country. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
these bills before us today. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers and I am prepared to 
close, so I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation. As 
our Nation’s small businesses continue 
to face numerous capital access chal-
lenges, the SBA’s existing government 
guarantee loan programs must be pre-
pared to provide assistance. This bill, 
H.R. 8211, does just that by expanding 
the 504/CDC Loan Program’s economic 
development goals and enhancing the 
program for small manufacturers. 
This program has a proven record of 
the success, and the improvements 
that this legislation delivers will con-
tinue this track record into the future. 
I ask for my colleagues’ support, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The SBA’s 504 program has enjoyed a 
track record of success in delivering af-
fordable, long-term capital to small 
businesses for acquiring land, real es-
tate, or heavy machinery. 
Furthermore, the CDCs who deliver 
the program are actively involved in 
promoting 
local 
economic 
develop-
ment, especially for underserved busi-
ness communities. 
As the chair of the Small Business 
Committee, I have seen the values 
CDCs have delivered in my community 
in New York City, across the State, 
and across the country. I am proud of 
our opportunity here today to continue 
supporting their work and helping en-
trepreneurs access affordable capital, 
especially as our local economies con-
tinue adjusting to the realities of con-
ducting business in the COVID–19 era. 
I want to applaud the work by Ms. 
CRAIG and Ranking Member CHABOT for 
their collaboration to improve the 504 
loan program. 
I encourage all my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8211, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 8199, which 
clarifies the role of SBA’s Office of 
Credit Risk Management with respect 
to the 504 loan program. 
In 2018, Congress passed bipartisan 
legislation to codify SBA’s Office of 
Credit Risk Management, which con-
ducts periodic reviews of SBA lenders 
to ensure they are complying with pro-
gram requirements and, ultimately, 
safeguarding the integrity of SBA’s 
loan programs. 
That legislation focused on the 7(a) 
loan program, giving the office the reg-
ulatory and enforcement tools it need-
ed to conduct oversight over SBA’s 
largest lending partners and hold them 
accountable. 
Today’s legislation takes that over-
sight work one step further by increas-
ing the office’s responsibilities in su-
pervising the 504 program, bringing 
much-needed consistency and clarity 
for all 504 program participants. 
The bill will shift loan closing file re-
view responsibilities for the 504 loan 
program to the Office of Credit Risk 
Management, streamlining and stand-
ardizing an important process. By in-
creasing SBA’s responsibilities in over-
seeing the 504 loan program, we are im-
proving the long-term sustainability of 
the program, ensuring it will be avail-
able for the next generation of entre-
preneurs. 
I applaud Mr. BISHOP and Ms. CRAIG 
for all of their diligence and persever-
ance on this issue and, more impor-
tantly, their commitment to America’s 
small businesses. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 8199, the 504 
Credit Risk Management Improvement 
Act of 2020. 
The SBA’s 504/CDC Loan Program 
provides lending assistance to thou-
sands of small businesses year in and 
year out. This assistance translates 
into supporting tens of thousands of 
jobs on an annual basis. This economic 
development program is and has been 
making a difference in neighborhoods 
and communities all across this great 
Nation. 
With any successful government pro-
gram, oversight must remain a signifi-
cant factor. H.R. 8199 places an impor-
tant focus on oversight and ensures the 
SBA has the appropriate capabilities to 
oversee the 504/CDC Loan Program. 
Beyond oversight, H.R. 8199 also en-
sures that the 504/CDC Loan Program 
participants have the rules and guid-
ance to comply with the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act and successfully 
operate within that program. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) and the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Ms. 
CRAIG) for their leadership and for 
working together to craft this legisla-
tion, once again, in a bipartisan man-
ner. 
I want to thank the chair, Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ also for encouraging that 
cooperation between both sides. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
BISHOP) and, again, thank him for his 
leadership in working across party 
lines with the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG). I want to commend 
her as well. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8199, the 504 Credit Risk Management 
Improvement Act of 2020. 
Small businesses are the core of our 
Nation’s entrepreneurship, innovation, 
and creative activity. It is paramount 
that Congress invest its resources into 
empowering small businesses to fuel 
job growth and transform commu-
nities. 
The 504 program gives small busi-
nesses necessary resources, and this 
legislation will bolster and improve the 
implementation of that program. By 
giving small businesses access to fixed- 
rate financing, through the 504 pro-
gram, small businesses that have lim-
ited capital are able to afford costly 
down payments. 
This program has made Queen City 
Catering a success story. When the 
company needed financing for a larger 
location, they turned to Business Ex-
pansion Funding Corporation, a cer-
tified development company in Char-
lotte that helped them secure a 504 
loan. These funds led to a new state-of- 
the-art kitchen for high-quality food 
preparation, management offices, high- 
tech conference areas, and warehouse 
space for rental items. 
Better yet, since receiving this 504 
loan, Queen City Catering has grown 
astronomically. This small business in-
vestment allowed the business to grow, 
while creating jobs for North Caro-
linians. 
Fellow Members of Congress, I im-
plore you to imagine the impact that 
504 loans have on small businesses in 
your communities. That is exactly 
what my colleague, Congresswoman 
CRAIG, did with me when we crafted the 
504 Credit Risk Management Improve-
ment Act. 
While the existing loan program has 
offered financial tools to help small 
businesses, we must act today and im-
prove the program so it can help busi-
nesses serve their communities for 
years to come. 
The bill before us outlines important 
capabilities of the SBA’s Office of Cred-
it Risk Management pertaining to the 
504/CDC Loan Program. Importantly, 
the changes will ensure the program’s

longevity by detailing how it should 
supervise a file review. 
Additionally, 
this 
legislation 
re-
quires the SBA to provide clear direc-
tion to certified development compa-
nies as they navigate environmental 
rules and regulations. 
Lastly, this will help ensure that the 
program continues to operate on the 
fees built into the program. 
I am confident that these improve-
ments will strengthen the program for 
both small businesses and the pro-
gram’s lending partners. This legisla-
tion is a step in the right direction to 
ensure that small businesses can thrive 
as they bring innovative goods and 
services to consumers around the coun-
try. 
I want to, again, thank Congress-
woman CRAIG, Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
and Ranking Member CHABOT for their 
work and their help on this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
b 1545 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers on my side, so I am 
happy to close. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress must continue 
to work together to strengthen the 
SBA’s existing guaranteed loan pro-
grams. The SBA’s programs must work 
for the Nation’s smallest firms and the 
Nation’s taxpayers. H.R. 8199 meets 
both objectives by applying appro-
priate oversight requirements to the 
SBA’s 504/CDC loan program. There-
fore, I urge my colleagues to support 
this bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank Ms. 
CRAIG and Mr. BISHOP for their leader-
ship, and I thank the chairwoman for 
her leadership on this. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, since its inception, 
SBA’s 504 program has enabled thou-
sands of businesses to hire employees, 
grow to more locations, and expand op-
erations. These 504 loans are some of 
the most affordable for commercial 
real estate projects, and most only re-
quire a 10 percent down payment from 
small business owners. In its 62-year 
history, it has proven to be a strong- 
performing SBA program that has 
helped entrepreneurs create jobs in 
every corner of our country. 
Thanks 
to 
Mr. 
BISHOP
and 
Ms. 
CRAIG’s efforts, the bill before us today 
will make commonsense improvements 
to this important program. By shifting 
all loan closing file review responsibil-
ities to the Office of Credit Risk Man-
agement, program integrity will be 
preserved, and the 504 program will be 
an affordable financing option for the 
next generation of entrepreneurs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8199, as

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

A motion to reconsider was laid on

minations in connection with the status of a 
concern as qualified HUBZone small business 
concern (as such term is defined in section 
31(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
657a(b))). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8229, the Parity for HUBZone Appeals 
Act of 2020, introduced by the gentle-
woman from American Samoa (Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN) 
and 
the 
gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN). 
H.R. 8229 will grant SBA’s Office of 
Hearings and Appeals jurisdiction over 
appeals of HUBZone eligibility deter-
minations. The Office of Hearings and 
Appeals provides independent quasi-ju-
dicial review of certain SBA program 
decisions. Under current law, the office 
decides appeals of eligibility deter-
minations in the women-owned and 
service-disabled veteran-owned small 
business contracting programs, but it 
does 
not 
review 
appeals 
for 
the 
HUBZone program. That process is dif-
ferent. 
When 
a 
protest 
challenging 
a 
HUBZone designation is filed, SBA’s 
HUBZone director will review and 
make a decision. If the decision is ap-
pealed, the head of the Office of Gov-
ernment Contracting and Business De-
velopment will review and render a de-
cision, which is final. 
By shifting HUBZone eligibility ap-
peals to the Office of Hearings and Ap-
peals, H.R. 8229 achieves priority and 
uniformity in SBA’s contracting pro-
grams. Moreover, it promotes trans-
parency since the office’s decisions are 
published. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8229, the Parity for HUBZone Appeals 
Act of 2020. 
As we have heard from the chair-
woman, the current appeals process for 
the HUBZone program raises several 
concerns, including questions of con-
flict of interest, lack of transparency, 
and lack of responsibility. 
The AA-GCBD plays a key leadership 
role within the organizational struc-
ture of the SBA and is primarily re-
sponsible for the supervision of all the 
SBA’s various Federal contracting pro-
grams, including the HUBZone pro-
gram. 
Unlike the AA-GCBD, the SBA’s Of-
fice of Hearings and Appeals is a fully 
functioning independent organization 
unconnected to the SBA’s Federal con-
tracting programs, and OHA adminis-
trative judges are trained to hear ex-
actly these types of matters. 
By moving HUBZone appeals from 
the 
AA-GCBD’s 
purview 
to 
OHA 
through the passage of this bill, the 
AA-GCBD will be empowered to focus 
on its primary supervisory responsibil-
ities while HUBZone small businesses 
will be able to receive impartial, fair, 
and knowledgeable treatment of their 
cases by OHA. 
H.R. 8229, this bill, makes a nec-
essary correction in the way HUBZone 
appeals are conducted. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Amer-
ican Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN), our 
vice ranking member, as well as the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
HOULAHAN) for their bipartisan leader-
ship on this legislation—again, Repub-
licans and Democrats working together 
on this committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN). 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member CHABOT
for 
yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8229, the Parity for HUBZone Appeals

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6079 
December 3, 2020 
Act of 2020. I thank Ms. HOULAHAN for 
her collaboration on this important 
legislation. 
SBA’s various small business con-
tracting programs support different 
types of entrepreneurs, from women 
and service-disabled veterans to mi-
norities and the economically dis-
advantaged, by providing these busi-
nesses with special Federal contracting 
preferences. 
Whether a business holds a specific 
status is critical in determining wheth-
er that company is eligible to compete 
for these special contract opportuni-
ties. Not only does the business have a 
vested interest in obtaining and main-
taining its status, but the Federal Gov-
ernment also has an interest in making 
sure these special contracts are not 
awarded to fraudulent firms. If a com-
pany is suspected to be ineligible for a 
status it claims to hold, an interested 
party can protest the firm’s status. 
Currently, for Historically Underuti-
lized 
Business 
Zone-qualified, 
or 
HUBZone-qualified, small businesses, 
the final arbiter of a firm’s special 
HUBZone status is the Associate Ad-
ministrator of the Office of Govern-
ment Contracting and Business Devel-
opment, or AA-GCBD. This differs sig-
nificantly from SBA’s other Federal 
contracting programs in which SBA’s 
Office of Hearings and Appeals, or 
OHA, is the final decisionmaker of a 
firm’s protested status. 
OHA, unlike the AA-GCBD, is an 
independent office of the SBA. Leaving 
the appeal decision to the AA-GCBD 
raises questions of conflict of interest, 
whereas housing that process at OHA 
will ensure the decision remains sepa-
rate and independent from any influ-
ence. 
Furthermore, 
the 
AA-GCBD 
has 
many competing priorities and respon-
sibilities in overseeing all the SBA’s 
Federal contracting programs. In con-
trast, OHA administrative judges are 
primarily tasked with adjudicating 
similar types of appeals and, thus, are 
well trained and well versed in making 
educated decisions objectively and im-
partially. Thus, passage of this bill 
means that small businesses will have 
a greater chance of having a fair and 
knowledgeable 
assessment 
of 
their 
case. 
Finally, the AA-GCBD’s appeals deci-
sions are currently made in a vacuum. 
There is no visibility into the reasons 
why a decision was reached. In con-
trast, all of OHA’s decisions are pub-
lished online and easily searchable. 
These opinions are critical for small 
businesses to obtain a greater under-
standing of the rules surrounding their 
eligibility. Therefore, shifting the re-
sponsibility to hear HUBZone appeals 
to OHA will provide the public with 
much-needed 
guidance 
and 
trans-
parency. 
In sum, H.R. 8229 will bring greater 
parity, fairness, and transparency be-
tween SBA’s HUBZone program and its 
other Federal contracting programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense legislation. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers on my side, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. 
It moves the ball forward. Moving the 
HUBZone appeals process to the OHA 
places small businesses that have a 
complaint about the program on equal 
footing with other appeals processes 
throughout the SBA, and that is a good 
thing. 
I 
want 
to, 
again, 
thank 
Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN for her leadership on this 
particular 
legislation 
and 
Ms. 
HOULAHAN from Pennsylvania as well, 
and the chairwoman, as always, for 
working in a bipartisan manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we all know consistent 
procedures in government foster a bet-
ter understanding of the rules and im-
prove overall agency effectiveness. 
H.R. 8229 furthers that ideal by pro-
viding the HUBZone program with par-
ity and uniformity with the women- 
owned and the service-disabled vet-
eran-owned programs. 
Furthermore, by making the Office of 
Hearings and Appeals the final arbiter 
of all protest eligibility determina-
tions, H.R. 8229 capitalizes on every-
thing the office has to offer: subject 
matter expertise, efficiency, and trans-
parency. 
I thank Mrs. RADEWAGEN
and Ms. 
HOULAHAN for working together on this 
bipartisan solution. 
Lastly, I would like to take a mo-
ment to thank the ranking member, 
Mr. CHABOT, for his outstanding service 
on the Small Business Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. CHABOT and I have 
led this committee together through 
four Congresses, each of us spending 
equal time as chair and ranking mem-
ber. Throughout it all, he has been an 
incredible partner, working closely 
with me in good times and bad. 
Over the course of our tenure, we 
have shepherded scores of bipartisan 
bills through the House, giving small 
businesses better access to capital, 
counseling, and Federal contracts. We 
have held numerous oversight hearings 
to make sure SBA programs were oper-
ating effectively and efficiently for 
small businesses, regardless of which 
party held the White House. In sum, we 
worked very well together. 
b 1600 
You may ask what is the secret to 
our success, especially during these po-
larizing times. And I will point to Rep-
resentative CHABOT, who is as com-
mitted to public service as I am. He 
puts politics aside and works with 
Democrats and Republicans alike to 
solve problems. 
When the pandemic struck, it hit 
small businesses particularly hard, and 
our committee was called to action. 
Small businesses that were once thriv-
ing were fighting for their very sur-
vival. Our committee was working day 
and night, trying to develop a bipar-
tisan package in mere days that will 
provide economic relief to small busi-
nesses. These were trying economic 
times, and we needed to bring people 
together and act fast to rescue small 
businesses. It wasn’t easy, but one 
thing was certain. I was fortunate to 
have Ranking Member CHABOT by my 
side. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the relief 
we have been able to deliver to our 
Main Street small businesses. I would 
also be remiss if I didn’t mention 
Ranking Member CHABOT’s excellent 
staff, who have worked tirelessly with 
us. I thank Kevin Fitzpatrick, Jan Oli-
ver, Joe Hartz, Rob Yavor, Vivian Ling, 
Delia Barr, Alison Kerman, and Rachel 
Emmons for their commitment and 
dedication. They have worked hand in 
glove with my staff to ensure hearings 
went well and the pandemic relief pro-
grams were working as intended. 
Mr. Speaker, I am saddened that 
Ranking Member CHABOT will not be 
returning to the committee as ranking 
member in the next Congress. I will 
certainly miss our conversations dur-
ing hearings and listening to the many 
unique ways his name is pronounced. I 
thought my name was tough. 
Steve, you will be sorely missed. 
Thank you for your leadership, dedica-
tion, and willingness to work across 
the aisle to make our world a little bit 
brighter. I wish you the very best in 
the next Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 8229, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8229. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

the interests of the peoples of the United 
States, India, and the world will benefit from 
a stronger United States-India partnership. 
(2) Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and 
Martin Luther King, Jr., were dedicated 
leaders fighting for social justice and social 
change, peace, and civil rights in their re-
spective communities, and countries and in 
the world. 
(3) The use of nonviolent civil disobedience 
is a shared tactic that has played a key role 
in defeating social injustice in India, the 
United States, and in other parts of the 
world. 
(4) Mohandas Gandhi, who was born on Oc-
tober 2, 1869, was murdered on January 30, 
1948, after dedicating his life to the peaceful 
empowerment of the people of India and to 
the end of British colonial rule. 
(5) Martin Luther King, Jr., who was born 
on January 15, 1929, was murdered on April 4, 
1968, after a life dedicated to peaceful move-
ments against segregation, discrimination, 
racial injustice, and poverty. 
(6) In February 1959, Dr. King and his wife, 
Coretta Scott King, traveled throughout 
India. By the end of his monthlong visit, Dr. 
King said, ‘‘I am more convinced than ever 
before that the method of nonviolent resist-
ance is the most potent weapon available to 
oppressed people in their struggle for justice 
and human dignity.’’. 
(7) Fifty years after Dr. King’s visit, All 
India Radio, the national radio station of 
India, discovered a taped message by Dr. 
King that emphasized the intellectual har-
mony between the messages of Dr. King and 
Mohandas Gandhi on nonviolent social ac-
tion. 
(8) On August 22, 2011, the Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., National Memorial opened to 
the public in Washington, DC. This newest 
memorial on the National Mall pays tribute 
to Dr. King’s national and international con-
tributions to world peace through nonviolent 
social change. 
(9) The 116th Congress coincides with both 
the 150th birth anniversary of Mohandas 
Gandhi and the 90th birth anniversary of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
(10) Mohandas Gandhi, who employed the 
principle of satyagraha, or ‘‘fighting with 
peace’’, has come to represent the moral 
force inspiring many civil and social rights 
movement around the world. 
(11) Dr. King’s effective use of Gandhi’s 
principles was instrumental to the American 
civil rights movement. 
(12) There is a long history of civil and so-
cial rights movements in the United States 
and in India. As the relationship between the 
United States and India evolves, a binational 
foundation through which the governments 
of each country can work together and cata-
lyze private investment toward development 
objectives would provide an ongoing, produc-
tive institution and symbol of the friendship 
and common ideals of the respective govern-
ments and their peoples. 
(13) There is a global goal of ending tuber-
culosis by 2030, the United States and India 
seek a TB-Free India by 2025, and the United 
States-India Gandhi-King Foundation will 
help address gaps across the TB value chain 
in prevention, detection, diagnosis, and 
treatment, and would catalyze market-based 
strategies to bridge the service gap for the 
‘‘last mile’’. 
(14) Leaders in both countries belonging to 
both major political parties have prioritized 
the United States-India relationship and on 
a bipartisan basis continue to support a 
strengthened United States-India partner-
ship, recognizing that it will be one of the 
defining partnerships of the 21st century. 
SEC. 3. GANDHI-KING SCHOLARLY EXCHANGE

values of Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr, the Secretary of State shall

(C) focus on studying the works of Gandhi 
and King, and applying their philosophies of

racy and democratic norms in countries 
around the world. 
(2) An undergraduate, graduate, and post- 
graduate student exchange for students in 
the United States and India to— 
(A) study the history and legacies of Mar-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 5517, the 
Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Ini-
tiative Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
strong support of the Gandhi-King 
Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act, a 
measure championed by our late friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
John 
Lewis of Georgia. 
In 2009, John traveled to India to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta 
Scott 
King’s 
journey 
to 
explore 
Gandhi’s teachings on the use of non-
violent direct action to advance social 
justice. John’s trip and his decades of 
civil rights work in public service— 
what he would call ‘‘good trouble’’—led 
to the Gandhi-King Scholarly Ex-
change Initiative Act. 
This legislation honors the long-
standing friendship between the people 
of the United States and India and es-
tablishes an educational exchange pro-
gram to advance the teachings of 
Mohandas Gandhi and Dr. King. It also 
establishes a development foundation 
that would allow India and the United 
States to work together to address 
pressing issues, like climate change, 
education, and public health. 
At a time when our country is strug-
gling to come to terms with the reality 
of systemic racism, I can think of no 
better time to advance the work of 
Gandhi; King; and John Lewis, our 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
measure, and I hope all of my col-
leagues will do the same. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, after years of working 
with India to address certain develop-
ment challenges, the United States has 
seen impressive results. The best re-
sults so far is that India, who was once 
a recipient of foreign aid, is now a 
donor country, but there is still a lot of 
work to be done. 
This is especially true when it comes 
to fighting tuberculosis, improving 
water sanitation, increasing education, 
and empowering women. That is why I 
urge my colleagues to support the Gan-
dhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative 
Act. 
This bill, authored by the late Rep-
resentative John Lewis, supports the 
establishment of a development fund 
that will continue our fight to improve 
these areas of concern. In addition, it 
will transition management of these 
programs from the United States to 
India. It is a public-private partnership 
powered by the Government of India 
and the private sector, and it is a true 
testament to how far India has come. 
This bill also honors the legacy of 
two 
men 
that 
it 
is 
named 
for, 
Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther 
King, Jr., by creating a professional ex-
change program to study pressing glob-
al challenges, including the struggle 
for civil rights, the fight to end pov-
erty, and strategies to decrease global 
conflicts. 
Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment 
to honor the remarkable legacy of Rep-
resentative John Lewis, who first in-
troduced this legislation. I am proud to 
be here on the floor with Chairman 
ENGEL in support of his bill. The cre-
ation of this foundation is just another 
example of his dedication to improving 
the lives of so many people not only 
here in the United States, but around 
the world. I thank the late Representa-
tive John Lewis, and I thank my 
friend, Chairman ENGEL, for bringing 
this important bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, the goal of 
U.S. foreign assistance should always 
be that countries graduate from our 
aid. Today, we move one step closer to 
this goal with the authorization of the 
US-India 
Gandhi-King 
Development 
Foundation. 
This bill further affirms a strong bi-
lateral relationship between United 
States and India and will strengthen

our ties to the world’s largest democ-
racy. 
Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud we are con-
sidering this excellent measure written 
by our dear friend, John Lewis. I know 
we all miss John dearly, but his legacy 
of advancing the cause of righteousness 
and justice lives on, and this is a good 
example. 
John championed the Gandhi-King 
Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act to 
further the teachings of Gandhi and Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Their work on 
civil rights and social justice should be 
a beacon for us all, and I am pleased we 
can pass a measure today to continue 
their invaluable work for humanity. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and 
partner, Mr. MCCAUL. It is a pleasure 
once again to work with him on the 
committee and to work on legislation 
for the country and the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a co-
sponsor and a member of the Congressional 
Caucus on India and Indian Americans, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 5517, the ‘‘Gandhi- 
King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act’’, which 
establishes an exchange initiative between the 
United States and India to study the work and 
legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. 
First and foremost, I wish to express my 
gratitude and fondness for my former col-
league and dear friend, John Lewis, who 
passed away a few months ago, for intro-
ducing and leading this vital piece of legisla-
tion. 
By passing this bill today, we authorize the 
U.S. Department of State, in cooperation with 
the Indian Government, to incorporate three 
new programs: 
the Gandhi-King Scholarly Initiative, which 
creates an annual educational forum for schol-
ars from both countries that focuses on the 
legacies of Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr; 
the Gandhi-King Global Academy, a United 
States Institute of Peace (USIP) program 
tasked with developing a professional develop-
ment training initiative on conflict resolution 
based on the principles of nonviolence; and 
the United States-India Gandhi-King Devel-
opment Foundation, which establishes a foun-
dation to address social, environmental, and 
health priorities in India. 
Mr. Speaker, Congressman Lewis was a 
giant among us mere mortals. 
Not only was he the conscience of the Con-
gress, widely beloved and revered on both 
sides of the aisle, but he was also one of the 
Original Big Six, a pillar of the Civil Rights 
Movement, and a lifelong warrior for a more 
just, equitable, and better America. 
Like Gandhi and Dr. King, Congressman 
Lewis shaped the world through his actions of 
nonviolence, and it is in his honor that we 
gather here today to vote on a bill he cham-
pioned. 
To quote Congressman Lewis, ‘‘Both Gan-
dhi and King were inspired human beings who 
believed deeply in the power of nonviolent re-
sistance to injustice as a tool for social 
change.’’ 
It is because of their courage, commitment, 
and vision of a more tolerant and equitable 
world that we are all able to enjoy and prac-
tice our most fundamental democratic free-
doms. 
As the world’s oldest and largest democ-
racies, the United States and India have long 
traditions of upholding these shared values of 
nonviolent revolutions championed by figures 
like Gandhi, King, and Lewis. 
But as we have seen over the past few 
years, both countries have experienced signifi-
cant affronts to the fundamental democratic 
principles, which threaten to erode the values 
that these men and many others have given 
their lives to protect. 
Mr. Speaker, the ‘‘Gandhi-King Scholarly 
Exchange Initiative Act’’ seeks to apply the 
philosophies of Gandhi and Dr. King to conflict 
resolution efforts and current policy chal-
lenges. 
With this legislation, we seek to embody the 
best of what we saw of Gandhi, Dr. King, and 
Congressman Lewis in their fight for equality 
and justice as well as seek to preserve these 
values so that future generations are empow-
ered and able to continue the fight against in-
justice. 
Just a few months ago, the world was re-
minded of the power nonviolent resistance has 
to effect positive change in the face of grave 
injustices. 
In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, mil-
lions of people across the world and in all 50 
states within the U.S. gathered together to 
peacefully protest against police brutality. 
People of different races, socioeconomic 
classes, ethnicities, genders, and sexual ori-
entations came together to demonstrate in the 
most democratic way possible. 
Mr. Speaker, those marches, which were, 
without a doubt, inspired by the marches led 
by Gandhi and Dr. King, have resulted in a 
genuine dialogue about institutional racism in 
this country and have awakened efforts to re-
form the system, so that it truly benefits all 
people. 
I am honored to be a leader on this bill, and 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 5517, the ‘‘Gandhi-King Scholarly Ex-
change Initiative Act.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5517, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

WAR CRIMES REWARDS 
EXPANSION ACT 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1819) to amend the State Depart-
ment Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to 
provide for rewards for the arrest or 
conviction of certain foreign nationals 
who have committed genocide or war 
crimes, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1819 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘War Crimes 
Rewards Expansion Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PRO-
GRAM. 
Paragraph (10) of section 36(b) of the State 
Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 
U.S.C. 2708(b)) is amended by striking ‘‘de-
fined under the statute of such tribunal;’’ 
and inserting the following: ‘‘defined under— 
‘‘(A) the statute of such country or tri-
bunal, as the case may be; or 
‘‘(B) United States law;’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 1819, the War 
Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
the War Crimes Rewards Expansion 
Act, and I thank Congresswoman FOXX 
for her hard work on this bill. 
This bipartisan measure enhances 
the War Crimes Rewards Program, 
which enables the United States to pay 
rewards to individuals who provide in-
formation that leads to the arrest or 
conviction of foreign nationals who 
commit war crimes, crimes against hu-
manity, or genocide. 
This initiative has led to the capture 
of fugitives who committed atrocities 
in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. 
This War Crimes Rewards Expansion 
Act will strengthen this rewards pro-
gram and ensure that it can be used to 
bring perpetrators to justice, whether 
it is in domestic courts or inter-
national tribunals. 
Mr. Speaker, American foreign policy 
should reflect our values, including the 
promotion of human rights, and we 
must do everything possible to bring 
justice to victims of atrocities and 
hold perpetrators accountable. This 
legislation is an important step in that 
direction, and I am pleased to support 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, we live in a world 
where crimes against humanity still 
occur. We have seen two declared geno-
cides in just the last 20 years—in 
Darfur in 2004, and by ISIS in 2016.

H6083 
December 3, 2020 
We have seen the horrific ethnic 
cleanings against the Rohingya in 
Burma. We have seen the atrocities 
committed by Assad against his own 
people in Syria. But bringing the 
criminals behind these massacres to 
justice can be difficult. That is why 35 
years ago, we enacted the State De-
partment’s Rewards program. It au-
thorizes the Secretary of State to offer 
rewards for the arrest or conviction of 
some of the most dangerous people in 
the world. 
Originally written to be used against 
international terrorists, the successful 
program has since been expanded to in-
clude drug traffickers, war criminals, 
and perpetrators of genocide. As the 
world changes and as the international 
criminals evolve, we need to make sure 
this important program evolves with 
them. And that is why I urge my col-
leagues to join us in supporting the 
War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill makes clear 
that these rewards are not just meant 
to 
support 
international 
tribunals. 
They can also be used to bring these 
dangerous criminals to justice here in 
the United States, under United States 
law. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of 
this bill, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. FOXX), and my good 
friend, Chairman ENGEL, for consid-
ering this bill today, which deserves 
our support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I echo the words of Mr. 
MCCAUL. I am pleased to support this 
legislation, and I urge all Members to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS 
THAT YEVGENIY PRIGOZHIN AND 
HIS AFFILIATED ENTITIES POSE 
A THREAT TO INTERESTS AND 
SECURITY 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 996) expressing the sense 
of Congress that the activities of Rus-
sian national Yevgeniy Prigozhin and 
his affiliated entities pose a threat to 
the national interests and security of 
the United States and of its allies and 
partners, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:

Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin is a Russian 
national who has maintained close personal 
ties with President Vladimir Putin since the 
early 2000s; 
Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin is the patron 
and funder of the Wagner Group, also known 
as the Private Military Company (PMC) 
Wagner, a Russian mercenary organization 
staffed by current and former military and 
intelligence officers, and the Internet Re-
search Agency (IRA), an organization en-
gaged in online influence operations; 
Whereas the IRA has conducted online in-
formation operations against the United 
States in an attempt to sow division and dis-
cord among the American electorate, as well 
as the electorates of our European allies and 
partners; 
Whereas 
entities 
funded 
by 
Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin have been used by the Government 
of the Russian Federation to conduct mili-
tary 
action, 
subversive 
operations, 
and 
disinformation campaigns on its behalf while 
giving 
it 
an 
appearance 
of 
plausible 
deniability; 
Whereas the Wagner Group was involved in 
the Russian Federation’s military invasion 
and attempted annexation of Ukraine’s Cri-
mea region in February and March 2014, and 
in the subsequent insurgencies in the eastern 
Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has been pro-
viding military support to the regime of 
Bashar al-Assad in Syria since 2015, fighting 
alongside its forces and helping it recapture 
significant parts of the country; 
Whereas, on February 7, 2018, the Wagner 
Group led an armed assault on United States 
troops near the city of Deir al-Zour in east-

terattack, in what has been described as 
‘‘the deadliest U.S.-Russia clash since the 
Cold War’’;

meeting between Haftar and Russian Defense 
Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow on No-
vember 7, 2018; 
Whereas a United Nations report made 
public on May 6, 2020, concluded that the 
Wagner Group has operated up to 1,200 mili-
tary contractors in Libya, including snipers 
and specialized military teams, serving as 
‘‘an effective force multiplier’’ for Haftar’s 
army. 
Whereas mercenaries from the Wagner 
Group were deployed to Venezuela in Janu-
ary 2019 to provide support for the regime of 
Nicolas Maduro in the face of popular pro-
tests against his dictatorship; 
Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affili-
ated entities have spearheaded operations 
with the intent to influence political proc-
esses in Africa on behalf of the Government 
of the Russian Federation in several coun-
tries, including Madagascar, South Africa, 
Sudan, Zimbabwe, and the Central African 
Republic; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has deployed 
mercenaries to the Central African Republic 
since 2018 and has provided security detail 
for 
Central 
African 
Republic 
President 
Faustin-Archange Touadera, including Rus-
sian national Valery Zakharov, a former se-
curity official with close ties to the Wagner 
Group, who serves as the National Security 
Adviser; 
Whereas, on July 31, 2018, Russian journal-
ists Orkhan Dzhemal, Kirill Radchenko, and 
Alexander Rastorguyev were murdered in the 
Central African Republic while working on a

Wagner Group in that country; 
Whereas according to an investigation by 
the London-based Dossier Center, the jour-
nalists had been tracked by officers of the 
Central African Republic gendarmerie who 
were in close communication with Russian 
nationals tied to the Wagner Group, includ-
ing Valery Zakharov and Alexander Sotov; 
Whereas associates of Yevgeniy Prigozhin 
were reported to discuss plans to set up 
camps ‘‘for combat prep and training in sab-
otage’’ with the goal of stoking racial vio-
lence and carrying out domestic terror at-
tacks in the United States in the run-up to 
the November 3, 2020, presidential election; 
Whereas associates of Yevgeniy Prigozhin 
have set up online influence operations based 
in Ghana and Nigeria to target social media 
audiences in the United States with the goal 
of inflaming racial tensions and provoking 
social unrest in the run-up to the November 
3, 2020, presidential election; 
Whereas, on December 20, 2016, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury designated Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin 
under 
Executive 
Order 
13661, 
‘‘Blocking Property of Additional Persons 
Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine’’,

or provided financial, material, or techno-
logical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, senior officials of the Russian 
Federation’’; 
Whereas, on June 20, 2017, the Department

rity of Ukraine’’;

fering with [U.S.] election processes or insti-
tutions’’;

sanctions as well as Prigozhin-linked enti-
ties that have attempted to suppress and dis-
credit protestors seeking reforms in Sudan; 
Whereas, on September 23, 2020, pursuant 
to Executive Orders 13848, 13694 (as amend-
ed), and 13661, the Department of the Treas-

tion officials have affirmed that the malign 
activities of Yevgeniy Prigozhin around the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
996. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
joining me to introduce this measure 
condemning one of the principal archi-
tects of Russian aggression around the 
world. Yevgeniy Prigozhin is one of 
Vladimir Putin’s key cronies, with a 
long history of working against Amer-
ican interests on behalf of the Russian 
Government. His Internet Research 
Agency disinformation campaigns have 
worked to sow division and undermine 
democratic elections right here at 
home and also among our allies. 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin is also the leader 
of the Wagner Group, a Russian merce-
nary organization, that has spread 
deadly conflict across the globe, engag-
ing in violent and subversive oper-
ations in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, and 
sub-Saharan Africa. He has directed 
human rights violations in Syria, un-
dermined U.S. operations in the Middle 
East, and played a key role in invading 
and destabilizing Ukraine. 
We must hold Prigozhin accountable 
and take action to stop his nefarious 
activities. This resolution condemns 
Prigozhin and his Kremlin partners, ex-
presses strong support for the U.S. and 
European Union sanctions on him, 
which were announced this fall, and 
calls for the imposition of additional 
targeted sanctions. 
As Putin and his henchmen, like 
Prigozhin, continue their attacks on 
democracies across the world, Congress 
must send a strong, unified message 
that we will not tolerate their desta-
bilizing actions and that we are ready 
to hold them accountable. Passing this 
resolution does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
measure, urge all my colleagues to do 
the same, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Yevgeniy Prigozhin is 
one of the most destructive operators 
within Vladimir Putin’s corrupt re-
gime. The destabilizing activity that 
he has directed and financed can be felt 
throughout the world. 
Mr. Prigozhin bankrolls the Russian 
Wagner Group, whose mercenaries have 
fanned the deadly flames of conflicts, 
propped up dictatorships, committed 
gruesome human rights abuses, all at 
the Kremlin’s direction. 
In Ukraine, the Wagner Group sup-
ported Russia’s illegal annexation of 
Crimea and the pro-Russian separatists 
in the country’s east. They have pro-
vided military support to the mur-
derous Bashar al-Assad regime, and 
they even led an assault against U.S. 
troops in Syria in 2018. 
In Libya, Russia has jeopardized ef-
forts to bring peace to the country by 
supporting Haftar, as well as by send-
ing advanced Russian aircraft and 
thousands of mercenaries from the 
Wagner Group into the country. 
The Wagner Group is also actively 
meddling in the domestic politics of 
numerous African countries. There, 
they hope to expand Russian influence 
on the continent while also exploiting 
Africa’s natural resources for their own 
profit. 
The United States is not immune 
from the threat posed by the Wagner 
Group. Mr. Prigozhin financed the 
Internet Research Agency, a Russian 
troll farm that has attempted to inter-
fere in the United States elections and 
sow discord among the American peo-
ple. 
Let me be clear. Mr. Prigozhin is a 
direct threat to the United States. We 
cannot allow this behavior to go un-
checked. The United States has re-
sponded forcefully, sanctioning him, 
the Wagner Group, the Internet Re-
search Agency, and many more of Mr. 
Prigozhin’s front companies and affili-
ates. 
In October, I was glad to see the EU 
join the United States in sanctioning 
Mr. Prigozhin as well. 
However, we must keep up the pres-
sure. That is why I support the resolu-
tion before us today. It condemns Mr. 
Prigozhin’s corrupt activity, and it 
sends a direct message to the Kremlin 
that the United States Congress will 
continue to hold Mr. Prigozhin ac-
countable for his efforts to further the 
Putin regime’s malign agenda. It also 
exposes the truth about the Kremlin’s 
ridiculous claim that Mr. Prigozhin 
and the Wagner Group operate inde-
pendently. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this resolution’s passage, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, Yevgeniy Prigozhin is 
an enemy of democracy and an adver-
sary of the U.S. and our allies. 
From sowing discord and division 
through disinformation campaigns to 
stoking violent conflicts around the 
world, Prigozhin is a dangerous Putin 
crony. 
This bipartisan measure condemns 
Prigozhin’s nefarious activities and 
demonstrates Congress’ support for 
continued 
cooperation 
between 
the 
United States and our European allies 
to hold him and his Kremlin partners 
accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 996, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Whereas Igor Rudnikov’s detention and 
charges were criticized by the OSCE Rep-

calling 
them 
‘‘clearly trumped-up’’ and ‘‘an act of polit-

Karelia region of the Russian Federation 
who has worked to document mass burial

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
958. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 958, which condemns politi-
cally motivated imprisonment by the 
Russian Government and calls for the 
immediate release of all political pris-
oners in Russia. 
According to the Memorial Human 
Rights Center, there are more than 300 
political prisoners in Russia today. 
These prisoners are human rights advo-
cates, journalists, Ukrainians from Cri-
mea, and American citizens like Paul 
Whelan and Trevor Reed. 
It has been common practice for the 
Kremlin to target opposition figures as 
an act of political revenge. Russian au-
thorities regularly abuse counterter-
rorism laws and Interpol’s Red Notice 
system to silence critics and deny 
them fundamental human rights. 
We must not only condemn these 
abuses, but we must increase the eco-
nomic and political cost for Russian of-
ficials 
who 
engage 
in 
unjust 
imprisonments and political retalia-
tion. 
This resolution calls on the Depart-
ments of State and Treasury to use the 
Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Ac-
countability Act of 2012 and the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act to pursue Russia officials 
who are responsible for or complicit in 
politically motivated imprisonment. I 
remember in 2012, we all worked to-
gether to put this very important law 
on the books. 
No one deserves to be used as a polit-
ical pawn by Vladimir Putin. It is crit-
ical that Congress strongly condemns 
and 
takes 
action 
against 
Russia’s 
wrongful imprisonments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said many times 
that Vladimir Putin is not our friend. 
Under his command, the Russian Gov-
ernment has invaded Georgia, started a 
war with Ukraine, assisted Bashar al- 
Assad’s murderous campaign in Syria, 
and meddled in our elections. 
But he is not just a threat to inter-
national security. Vladimir Putin is an 
enemy of democracy. We know this by 
his brutal actions that he has taken 
against his own people. 
Over the last 20 years, under Putin’s 
control, Moscow has chipped away at 
the few political freedoms once enjoyed 
in Russia. Media outlets have been 
shut down; political parties have been 
attacked; opposition figures have been 
assassinated; and activists have been 
thrown in jail. 
This is not the future that so many 
in Russia had hoped for when the Iron 
Curtain was lifted. Now, hundreds of

December 3, 2020 
political prisoners occupy cells in Rus-
sian jails. They aren’t there because 
they are bad people. They aren’t there 
because they are real criminals. They 
are there because Vladimir Putin is 
afraid of them. He doesn’t want them 
to challenge his authority. He doesn’t 
want them to have a voice. 
Today, we have a chance to provide a 
voice for the people Putin has tried to 
silence. This resolution condemns the 
practice of jailing individuals for polit-
ical purposes and calls for the release 
of all political prisoners in Russia. It 
also urges the administration to im-
pose sanctions on Russian officials who 
are complicit in human rights abuses. 
Once again, I want to thank my good 
friend, Chairman ENGEL, for intro-
ducing this bill. He has been a great 
champion for victims of tyranny his 
entire career. I am grateful for all of 
his hard work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank 
my friend, the ranking member of the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee, 
Mr. 
MCCAUL. It has been a pleasure work-
ing closely with him on so many pieces 
of legislation. I know that the work 
will continue, and we will continue to 
keep in touch and make sure that we 
go the right way in trying to stop these 
human rights abuses all over the world. 
The number of political prisoners in 
Russia has increased by sixfold since 
the year 2015. This is what we have 
come to expect from Vladimir Putin’s 
Russia: Blatant disregard for human 
rights and rule of law. 
The United States must stand firm 
against Russia’s practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment and impose 
sanctions against anyone responsible 
for these human rights abuses. It is 
really important that the U.S. Con-
gress stand up and do this. It is really 
important that we do it, regardless of 
political party. 
It is really important to send Putin a 
message that we are not going to sit 
idly by and allow him to do his bad 
work. He has interfered with our elec-
tions. He has tried again. He succeeded 
some of the time; he didn’t succeed in 
other times. But we want him to stay 
away, and we want the people of Russia 
to have a government where they can 
feel free, not one where they feel the 
boot on their neck all the time. 
We need to stand firm against Rus-
sia’s practice of politically motivated 
imprisonment and impose sanctions 
against anyone, even Putin, respon-
sible for these human rights abuses. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port H. Res. 958, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Tom Lantos Commission for 
Human Rights and a former member of the 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, I rise in strong support of this bipar-
tisan resolution, H. Res. 958, ‘‘Condemning 
the practice of politically motivated imprison-
ment and calling for the immediate release of 
political prisoners in the Russian Federation 
and urging action by the United States Gov-
ernment to impose sanctions with respect to 
persons responsible for that form of human 
rights abuse.’’ 
For years, Russia’s human rights record has 
continued to deteriorate, with the rights to 
freedom 
of 
expression, 
association, 
and 
peaceful assembly consistently restricted, both 
by law and in practice. 
Most often, the people who are courageous 
enough to attempt exercising their most basic 
human rights, including freedom of the press 
and freedom of speech, face reprisals, ranging 
from harassment to police ill-treatment, arbi-
trary arrest, heavy fines, and, in some cases, 
criminal prosecution and imprisonment. 
Among the Kremlin’s political prisoners are 
journalists, opposition activists, peaceful pro-
testers, adherents of ‘‘prohibited’’ religious 
groups, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, as well 
as members of ‘‘undesirable’’ political organi-
zations like Open Russia, an organization that 
has done a lot to support victims of human 
rights violations in Russia. 
In fact, several human rights defenders and 
NGOs have been targeted within Russia under 
the laws on ‘‘foreign agents’’ and ‘‘undesirable 
organizations’’. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution seeks to do 
three things: 
Condemn the practice of politically moti-
vated imprisonment by the Russian govern-
ment, particularly under the leadership of 
President Vladimir Putin; 
Call for the immediate release of those des-
ignated as political prisoners in the Russian 
Federation; and 
Urge the current Administration to impose 
sanctions on those responsible for these 
human 
rights 
abuses 
using 
the 
Sergei 
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, the 
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability 
Act, or other authorities. 
By passing this resolution today, we are 
sending a bipartisan message to the Russian 
Government that we see the violations of 
human rights that are occurring, and we will 
not stand idly by while people who are fighting 
for progress are tortured and ill-treated. 
Furthermore, counter-terrorism provisions 
are widely used to target dissent across the 
country and in Crimea, and torture tactics re-
main pervasive, as does impunity for its per-
petrators. 
Last year, due to the growing disconnect 
between the authorities and general public, 
there was an increase in street protests, rang-
ing from political to economic to social and 
even to environmental issues. 
In July and August of 2019, more than 
2,600 people were arrested during protests in 
Moscow, which had remained peaceful until 
the police and National Guard officers forcibly 
intervened. 
According to Amnesty International, there 
were numerous reports of arbitrary arrest, use 
of excessive, as well as indiscriminate force 
and ill-treatment of protesters by the officers, 
but none of these cases were known to have 
been investigated. 
As a fierce defender of human rights and 
the world’s oldest democracy, the United 
States has a duty to the world to speak up in 
the face of injustice and when violations of 
international commitments, including the incar-
ceration of political prisoners, occur. 
It is our responsibility as Members of Con-
gress to pass this resolution today in order to 
urge the Russian Federation to release its po-
litical prisoners and respect the basic human 
rights of its citizens. 
I urge all Members on both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting for H. Res. 958, 
‘‘Condemning the practice of politically moti-
vated imprisonment and calling for the imme-
diate release of political prisoners in the Rus-
sian Federation and urging action by the 
United States Government to impose sanc-
tions with respect to persons responsible for 
that form of human rights abuse.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 958, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to.

EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER 
DETENTION OF AUSTIN TICE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 17) expressing concern 
over the detention of Austin Tice, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 17 
Whereas Austin Tice is a 39-year-old vet-
eran, having served in the Marine Corps as 
an infantry officer, a Georgetown law stu-
dent, and a graduate of Georgetown Univer-
sity, from Houston, Texas; 
Whereas Austin is an Eagle Scout, Na-
tional Merit Scholarship finalist, and eldest 
of seven children; 
Whereas Austin was a contributing free-
lance journalist to McClatchy Newspapers, 
the Washington Post and other media out-
lets, and a recipient of the 2012 George Polk 
Award for War Reporting; 
Whereas, in May 2012, Austin crossed the 
Turkey-Syria border to report on the inten-
sifying conflict in Syria; 
Whereas, on August 11, 2012, Austin cele-
brated his 31st birthday in Darayaa, Syria; 
Whereas, on August 14, 2012, Austin de-
parted for Beirut, Lebanon, was detained at 
a checkpoint near Damascus, Syria, and con-
tact with family, friends, and colleagues 
ceased; 
Whereas, in late September 2012, a video 
clip appeared on YouTube showing Austin 
blindfolded and being prodded up a hillside 
by masked militants; 
Whereas in the years since Austin’s dis-
appearance, no group has claimed responsi-
bility for his capture; 
Whereas the Syrian government has never 
acknowledged detaining Austin and has de-
nied the same to Austin’s parents; 
Whereas officials of the United States be-
lieve Austin is alive and being held in Syria 
and that the Syrian government should as-
sist in locating and returning Austin to his 
family;

United Nations, and many others; 
Whereas the Tices have traveled to the 
Middle East multiple times, most recently in 
December 2018, seeking Austin’s safe release, 
and Debra Tice spent four months living in 
Damascus, Syria, for the same purpose; 
Whereas the Tices have partnered with Re-
porters Without Borders to launch cam-
paigns with nearly 270 newspapers and media 
organizations, highlighting Austin’s case in 
their publications and on their websites; 
Whereas institutions and organizations, in-
cluding Georgetown University, Georgetown 
Law Center, the National Press Club, the 
Committee 
to 
Protect 
Journalists, 
McClatchy, and the Washington Post, have 
collaborated to raise and maintain public 
awareness of Austin’s detention; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2018, then- 
United States Special Presidential Envoy for 
Hostage Affairs, Robert O’Brien, said that 
the United States Government believes Aus-
tin Tice is alive; 
Whereas at a press briefing on March 19, 
2020, President Trump expressed concern for 
Austin and called on the Syrian government 
to release him; 
Whereas Majd Kamalmaz is a 62-year old 
Syrian-American psychotherapist, father of 
four, and resident of Texas; 
Whereas Majd is a well-known mental- 
health professional with experience in dis-
aster relief and post-traumatic care; 
Whereas in February 2017 Majd traveled to 
Syria to visit an elderly family member and 
aid civilians traumatized by the Syrian civil 
war; 
Whereas on February 16, 2017 Majd’s family 
received word that he had been detained at a 
checkpoint on his way to Ghouta, outside of 
Damascus, Syria; 
Whereas since February 2017 Majd’s family 
has not heard from him; 
Whereas the Syrian government has never 
publicly acknowledged detaining Majd; 
Whereas Majd’s family and the Syrian- 
American community have advocated tire-
lessly for his immediate release; 
Whereas in July 2020, United States Am-
bassador and Special Presidential Envoy for 
Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens publicly 
stated, ‘‘The U.S. Government is in frequent 
contact with the Kamalmaz family to pro-
vide support and information’’ and that 
‘‘Bringing home Majd, along with all U.S. 
citizens held hostage or wrongfully detained 
abroad, has the attention of the highest lev-
els in the U.S. government.’’; and 
Whereas, as described in the Caesar Syria 
Civilian Protection Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 
note), Congress calls on the regime of Bashar 
al-Assad to release all political prisoners 
forcibly held within its prison system and to 
allow access to the same facilities for inves-
tigations 
by 
appropriate 
international 
human rights organizations: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) expresses its ongoing concern regarding 
the capture of Austin Tice in August 2012 and 
Majd Kamalmaz in February 2017, and their 
continuing detention; 
(2) encourages the Department of State, 
the intelligence community, and the inter-
agency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell to 
jointly continue investigations and to pursue 
all possible information regarding Austin 
and Majd’s detention; 
(3) encourages the Department of State 
and the Special Presidential Envoy for Hos-
tage Affairs to engage the Syrian govern-
ment to facilitate Austin and Majd’s safe re-
lease and return; 
(4) encourages the Department of State to 
work with foreign governments known to 
have diplomatic influence with the Syrian 
government; and 
(5) requests that the Department of State 
and the intelligence community continue to 
work with and inform Congress and the fami-
lies of Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz to 
the extent possible regarding efforts to se-
cure their safe release and return from de-
tention in Syria. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 17. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in August 2012, Amer-
ican journalist and Marine veteran 
Austin Tice was abducted while report-
ing on the ongoing conflict in Syria. 
Eight years later, Tice continues to be 
held captive, his family and friends un-
aware of his condition and where-
abouts. 
Five years later, another American 
citizen, 
Texas 
resident 
and 
psychotherapist Majd Kamalmaz, was 
detained without cause in northern 
Syria while visiting an elderly family 
member and aiding civilians trauma-
tized by the civil war. Kamalmaz has 
been imprisoned by the Assad regime 
in Syria ever since without access to 
the outside world. 
The Tice and Kamalmaz families 
have worked tirelessly to secure the 
immediate release of their loved ones. 
Still, Austin and Majd continue to suf-
fer inside Syria. H. Res. 17 encourages 
the Department of State, the Office of 
the Special Presidential Envoy for Hos-
tage Affairs, and other U.S. Govern-
ment entities to work jointly to facili-
tate Tice and Kamalmaz’ safe release 
and return. 
This legislation does not legitimize 
the Assad regime. I would never do 
that. For years and years, I have called 
them out on all of their human rights 
violations. It is a brutal regime, mur-
dering men, women, and children in the 
hundreds of thousands. 
So, this doesn’t legitimize the Assad 
regime, nor does it legitimize the de-
plorable tactic of hostage-taking. In 
fact, it does the opposite. 
Passing this resolution is a recogni-
tion that our country stands with Aus-
tin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz and those 
like them who have been victims of the 
Assad regime. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
AL GREEN for introducing this impor-
tant legislation. I want to also recog-
nize, once again, our committee’s rank-
ing member, MICHAEL MCCAUL, for his 
leadership on this issue. I am proud to 
support this measure, and I encourage 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6088 
December 3, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, 3,034 days. That is how 
long Austin Tice, a former U.S. marine 
and freelance journalist, has been held 
captive in Syria. It is far past time 
that he be returned home to his family 
in Houston. 
Austin has dedicated his life to his 
country and to serving others. After 
serving 10 years in the United States 
Marine Corps, Austin decided to enroll 
in law school. He wanted to continue 
helping those who needed help the 
most. While he was attending George-
town Law, just down the street from 
here, he couldn’t stop thinking about 
what he had seen and the people he had 
met on his tours in the Middle East. 
So, before beginning his final year of 
law school, Austin decided to return to 
the Middle East. Only this time, it 
would be to report on the atrocities 
happening in Syria. 
The Assad regime’s brutal attacks on 
its own people were horrifying to hear 
about. They were even using chemical 
weapons on their own people. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough 
reporters on the ground in Syria to 
verify their crimes or tell the world 
about the suffering of the Syrian peo-
ple. So, Austin did what he has always 
done. He stepped up to the plate and 
filled a much-needed void in a very 
dangerous place in order to help those 
who could not help themselves. 
But then, on August 14, 2012, as he 
was preparing to return home, Austin 
was captured at a checkpoint in Da-
mascus. Now, more than 8 years later, 
he is still being held in Syria. Austin is 
now entering his ninth year of cap-
tivity. In just a matter of months, he 
will turn 40 years old. 
Mr. Speaker, that is nine birthdays 
that he will have missed back home, 
nine Thanksgiving dinners without his 
family. Later this month, it will be 
nine Christmases that his family has 
had to endure without him. 
I have met Austin’s parents many 
times, and it is very tragic and emo-
tional. Each time, I see the pain in 
their eyes as they describe their tire-
less efforts to bring him home. That is 
a pain that only parents can truly un-
derstand. 
It is up to us here in this Chamber to 
show the Tice family that we will not 
tolerate this for another year. Austin 
deserves to have his life back, and his 
family deserves to have him back. 
Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, we 
once again urge the administration to 
continue 
working to bring Austin 
home. The State Department should 
use all the tools at its disposal to en-
sure his safe and immediate return. 
Congress will not rest, and I will not 
rest, and my colleague, Congressman 
GREEN, will not rest until Austin and 
the other American hostages detained 
abroad have been safely reunited with 
their families. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend 
and colleague, Congressman AL GREEN, 
for his introduction of this bill. The 
Tice family are his constituents. He 
has stood by them day in and day out 
over the past years. He and I, working 
together with other Members in this 
Chamber, will bring Austin home, fi-
nally. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), the author of this impor-
tant resolution. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairperson of the com-
mittee, Mr. ENGEL, and the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
committee, 
Mr. 
MCCAUL, for supporting this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am on a mission of 
mercy. I have been on a mission of 
mercy for 8 years because it has been 
more than 8 years now that Austin 
Tice has been detained in Syria. Eight 
years it has been. That is also how long 
this family has been grieving. 
I, too, know the Tice family. I have 
met with them multiple times and 
talked 
with 
them 
multiple 
times 
today, in fact. 
I am grateful to many people who 
have made it possible for this resolu-
tion to come to the floor, so I think it 
important that I immediately thank 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speak-
er PELOSI because I talked to her per-
sonally about the Tice situation. I 
thank Majority Leader HOYER; I had a 
conversation with him. I want to thank 
Congressman HILL for his steadfast re-
solve to not only help Austin but to 
help Dr. Kamalmaz, his constituent. 
Again, Chairman ENGEL
has been 
stellar, superb, and supreme in allow-
ing this to come to the floor. Mr. 
MCCAUL has been a great partner. He 
has demonstrated the kind of biparti-
sanship that the public expects from us 
on issues such as these. Of course, I 
thank the 41 cosponsors of this legisla-
tion. 
Finally, I thank the Tice family for 
having the courage, the strength, the 
intestinal fortitude to stay with it. 
Never one time have they given up on 
the belief that their son, their eldest 
son, can be returned home to them. 
Who was Austin Tice? Well, he loved 
his country. He loved his country. He 
went to the Marines. He was a Marine 
captain, a veteran Marine captain. He 
is such. He played by the rules. At 16 
years of age, he was in college. He re-
ceived his undergraduate degree from 
Georgetown University School of For-
eign Services. He played by the rules. 
He went on to get an opportunity to 
help others. He believed in helping 
other people. This is why he went to 
Syria. 
He went to those places where few of 
us would dare to go, and he went be-
cause he wanted the world to know 
what is happening in these distant 
places. And while he was there, he went 
missing. A month after he was not 
heard from, a 43-second video emerged 
with the title ‘‘Austin Tice is Alive.’’ 
We know that he is alive. We want 
him back alive. We are asking all who 
can be of service to do so. 
The President has weighed in. He has 
sent the Tice family a message indi-
cating that he is going to work hard to 
bring Austin home. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution today is 
another step in the direction of bring-
ing Austin Tice home. He is a great 
American. He has played by the rules. 
He is the kind of son that any one of us 
would want to have and the kind of son 
that Debra and Marc Tice are blessed 
to have. But their blessing should not 
end with having a son; their blessing 
should end with having their son with 
them. 
Again, I thank all who have played a 
role in getting this resolution to the 
floor. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL), whose constituent is 
Majd Kamalmaz. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Mr. MCCAUL, for the 
time and take a moment to salute and 
provide tribute to Congressman ELIOT 
ENGEL for his extraordinary service as 
chair of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee. His wise counsel will be 
missed in this House. 
Mr. Speaker, let me thank, too, my 
good friend on the House Financial 
Services Committee, a colleague and 
collaborator on many good things, my 
friend, Congressman AL GREEN from 
Houston, for his service and leadership 
on this important matter. 
Austin 
Bennett 
Tice, 
an 
inter-
national correspondent in Syria and a 
Marine veteran who we have heard 
about today, has been missing since 
2012. And my constituent, Dr. Majd 
Kamalmaz, a noted child therapist who 
was in Syria attending the funeral of a 
relative, has been missing since 2017. 
These families deserve certainty and 
recovery of their loved ones, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Both 
Mr. 
Tice 
and 
Dr. 
Kamalmaz have called on American 
and international leaders to bring 
home their loved ones. 
It is our duty to do whatever we can 
to ensure that these and all other 
Americans held abroad are returned 
safely and as soon as possible. 
I am grateful for the leadership of 
President Trump and now National Se-
curity Advisor and former Special 
Envoy 
for 
Hostage 
Affairs 
Robert 
O’Brien for their steadfast determina-
tion to bring American citizens home. 
Our work will not be complete until 
all Americans are reunited with their 
families and their loved ones. 
We ask for God’s blessings on this 
House floor for those held in captivity 
and for their loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I vote in favor, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this important legislation. Let’s pull 
together in this House to bring home 
our American hostages. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), the author of this impor-
tant resolution. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
on an issue such as this, no one should

be left behind who has played a role in 
helping with this cause. We have men-
tioned that it is bipartisan, but it is 
also bicameral. 
Senators CRUZ
and CORNYN
have 
played a role in helping us to get this 
message to the world. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank them, the 41 Members 
who signed on, and all others who 
signed on to a letter that we sent to 
the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-
portunity to say these words of grati-
tude and thanks. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, the 
story of Austin Tice’s disappearance 
and presumed imprisonment is tragic 
and frustrating. 
I met with Austin’s loving parents, 
Marc and Debra, last year in my office, 
where they told me about the heart-
breaking details of his abduction in 
2012 at a checkpoint near Damascus on 
his way to Beirut. 
Hearing about Austin, I knew I had 
to do what I could to try and help, just 
like these other Members who have 
spoken earlier. So, with the Tices sit-
ting in my office, I called upon the help 
of my Syrian-American friend and con-
stituent, Paul Jallo. I put Mr. Jallo on 
speakerphone as we brainstormed with 
Marc and Debra as to how we could 
navigate the treachery of this situa-
tion on the ground in Syria. 
b 1645 
Paul vowed to enlist the assistance of 
his family and friends living in Damas-
cus to try and garner critical informa-
tion as to Austin’s current location 
and the identity of his captors. I can-
not thank and commend Paul enough 
for his continued efforts to help the 
Tices in this ongoing endeavor to de-
termine the status of Austin’s well- 
being. 
We are frustrated, Mr. Speaker, that 
we still can’t confirm with any degree 
of certainty Austin’s captors, though 
we believe that Syrian President al- 
Assad’s government has within its 
power and influence to see to Austin’s 
release, despite denials of detaining 
him. 
This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. 
Austin was not a combatant, not a 
threat to al-Assad’s regime, and yet he 
had to endure the terrible fate of im-
prisonment without acknowledgment. 
Austin, who proudly served our coun-
try as an officer in the United States 
Marine Corps, deserves better, and his 
parents, Marc and Deborah Tice, who 
have tirelessly fought for answers, de-
serve better. 
Today we are going to send a mes-
sage to the Syrian Government that 
the United States of America has not 
forgotten about Austin Tice and that 
we will not give up on him. 
Today we are here, and we are going 
to stand up and fight for someone who 
put himself in the face of danger to 
make sure that we always knew the 
truth of what went on in Syria and 
continues to go on. 
Please join me in supporting this res-
olution and sending a powerful mes-
sage. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ELIOT 
ENGEL, Representatives GREEN, BILI-
RAKIS, FRENCH HILL, and so many of my 
other colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle for supporting this important 
measure. 
Austin Tice dedicated his life to serv-
ice. From his time in the Marine Corps 
to his reporting on the brutal civil war 
and humanitarian crisis in Syria, he 
lived to improve the lives of others. 
Think about it: Austin went to Syria 
to document some of the most brutal 
crimes against humanity so the world 
would see it, to expose what Assad has 
done to his own people to the world, 
and the price he had to pay for that is 
to be put into a Syrian prison. 
It is far past time that we repay Aus-
tin for his service, not only to our 
country, but to the world to expose 
these war crimes, to expose what was 
happening over there, and the courage 
he had to go over there to photograph. 
By bringing him home to his friends 
and his family, that is the way we pay 
him back. We have to use every tool at 
our disposal within the United States 
Government to bring him home to his 
family. 
Again, I want to thank all those in-
volved, and in particular, Congressman 
GREEN, who represents the family, 
whom we have talked to extensively. 
This is one of those measures that is 
really an emotional one from the heart 
because we are talking about the life of 
a patriot who is trapped in a very bad 
prison in Syria overseas and cannot get 
out, and it has been 8 years—8 years, 
for God’s sake, Mr. Speaker. It is time 
to bring Austin home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for the pur-
pose of closing. 
Today’s resolution calls for the im-
mediate release of American citizens 
Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz, who 
have been unjustly held in Syria. It is 
time the Assad regime heeds our calls 
and works with the U.S. Government 
to secure their return home. 
I have been a critic of the Assad re-
gime in all the years I have been in 
Congress, which is 32 years. The Assad 
regime has been brutal with its own 
people, has murdered so many of its 
own people, and I know that Mr. 
MCCAUL will remember not so long ago, 
on the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
someone smuggled in a bunch of photo-
graphs that were taken in Syrian pris-
ons. They were horrific and reminded 
one of the 1930s and 1940s with the 
genocide in Europe. 
It is time the Assad regime heeds our 
calls and works with the U.S. Govern-
ment to secure the prisoners’ release 
home. The immediate release of Amer-
ican citizens Austin Tice and Majd 
Kamalmaz is very important to us. 
As you have heard, they have been 
unjustly held in Syria, and we are not 
going to let it go. We are not going to 
stop until they are released. It is the 
right thing to do, and it is the only 
thing that we can do. 
I again thank Congressman GREEN 
for introducing this bipartisan resolu-
tion. I thank Mr. MCCAUL for working 
with us on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a co-
sponsor, a mother, and a senior member of 
the House Judiciary Committee, I rise in 
strong support of this bipartisan resolution, H. 
Res. 17, ‘‘Expressing Concern Over the De-
tention of Austin Tice, and for other pur-
poses.’’ 
In May of 2012, the summer before Austin’s 
final year at Georgetown Law School, he 
chose to go to Syria as a freelance journalist 
to cover the country’s civil war. 
Austin felt compelled to tell the story of the 
horrific and ongoing conflict there as well as 
its impact on the people of Syria. 
On August 14, 2012, Austin departed from 
the town of Darayya, a suburb of Damascus, 
to travel to Lebanon, but shortly after leaving, 
he was detained at a Syrian check point. 
Five 
weeks 
later, 
a 
43-second 
video 
emerged online with the title, ‘‘Austin Tice is 
Alive’’, showing Austin being held by a group 
of unidentified men with assault rifles, but 
there was no other message that accom-
panied the video. 
Even still today, no group has claimed re-
sponsibility for his capture nor have there 
been any demands in exchange for his re-
lease. 
Austin Tice was not a combatant. 
He was simply a young man doing his job, 
yet he has, without a doubt, had to suffer un-
imaginable ordeals and face the dangers of 
conflict, hostile governments, and rapacious 
bandits while reporting on the Syrian civil war. 
My heart goes out to Austin’s parents, 
Debra and Marc Tice, as well as the rest of 
his family and loved ones for the pain and un-
certainty that they have had to endure for over 
eight years. 
Eight years. 
Mr. Speaker, that is over 2,920 days that 
Austin’s mother has had to go without hearing 
his voice, holding his hand, or seeing his face. 
Austin was born and raised in my home-
town, Houston, Texas. 
He is the oldest of seven siblings, a former 
U.S. Marine, and his lifelong dream was to be-
come an international correspondent for NPR. 
It is no secret that the risk of arrest, abduc-
tion, or death make journalism extremely dan-
gerous and difficult in Syria. 
In fact, according to Reporters Without Bor-
ders, Syria is ranked 174th out of 180 coun-
tries in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index. 
In 2020 alone, Reporters Without Borders 
has documented the killings of 40 journalists 
and 3 media assistants as well as the impris-
onment of 260 journalists, 122 citizen journal-
ists, and 12 media assistants in Syria. 
Last year, I joined 122 Members of the 
House of Representatives and over 50 Sen-
ators in a bipartisan letter to the President, de-
manding that his Administration act to facilitate 
Austin’s release from Syria.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6090 
December 3, 2020 
With that letter and this resolution, I am 
once again calling on the Department of State, 
the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for 
Hostage Affairs, and other U.S. government 
entities to engage with Syria for the purpose 
of securing Austin’s safe release. 
From serving in Afghanistan and Iraq as a 
Marine to working as a journalist dedicated to 
delivering vital news to the American people, 
Austin Tice spent his life giving back and 
showing up for this country. 
Now we need to do the same for him and 
bring him home. 
I am honored to be a leader on this resolu-
tion, and I wish to thank my colleague and 
good friend from Texas, Representative AL 
GREEN, for his leadership on this resolution. 
I urge all Members on both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting for H. Res. 17, ‘‘Ex-
pressing Concern over the Detention of Austin 
Tice, and for other purposes.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 17, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
expressing concern over the detention 
of Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz, 
and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE OF TREVOR REED 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 1115) calling for the im-
mediate release of Trevor Reed, a 
United States citizen who was unjustly 
sentenced to 9 years in a Russian pris-
on, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1115 
Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed 
is a resident of Granbury, Texas, and a 
United States Marine Corps veteran; 
Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow 
to visit his girlfriend on May 16, 2019; 
Whereas Moscow’s Police Service detained 
Trevor Reed on August 16, 2019; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grab-
bing the arm of the police officer driving the 
vehicle and elbowing another officer while en 
route to the police station, causing the vehi-
cle to swerve and therefore endangering the 
lives of the police officers; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed numerous diplomatic com-
plaints with the Russian Foreign Ministry 
regarding Trevor Reed being denied consular 
access, communications, medical treatment, 
family visitations, and other violations of 
the Vienna Convention on Consular Rela-
tions; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team pre-
sented video evidence from traffic camera 
footage to the courts that disproves the po-
lice 
officers’ 
statements 
of 
supposed 
endangerment and wrongdoing; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team was 
denied access to additional video evidence 
from the police vehicle and police station 
that had the potential to prove his inno-
cence; 
Whereas the police officers claimed emo-
tional and physical damages, but did not sus-
tain any visible injury, or claim any time 
missed from work; 
Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation and the Second 
Court of Cassation of General Jurisdiction 
concurred that Russian procedural law was 
violated in the way that Trevor Reed’s bail 
was revoked; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Moscow has filed complaints with the Rus-
sian Foreign Ministry regarding denial of 
communications with Trevor Reed; 
Whereas during the trial, the defense coun-
sel presented 59 minutes of traffic camera 
video that showed the police car— 
(1) did not change direction or leave its 
lane; 
(2) did not swerve; and 
(3) did not stop or slow down; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky Dis-
trict Court Judge Arnout read a verdict that 
dismissed all defense evidence, witnesses, 
and government experts and included infor-
mation from the investigator’s case files 
that were not discussed or read into the 
court files; 
Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed 
to 9 years in prison camp and was ordered to 
pay 100,000 rubles to each police officer for 
moral and physical injuries; 
Whereas Trevor Reed had already been de-
tained in Russia for 1 year at the time of the 
judge’s verdict; and 
Whereas, the United States Ambassador to 
Russia, John Sullivan, upon Trevor’s sen-
tencing, stated that the prosecution’s case 
and the evidence presented against Mr. Reed 
were ‘‘so preposterous that they provoked 
laughter in the courtroom’’, the conviction 
and sentence were ‘‘ridiculous’’, and ‘‘justice 
was not even considered’’: Now, therefore, be 
it— 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul 
Whelan, and all prisoners unjustly impris-
oned in the Russian Federation; 
(2) condemns the practice of politically 
motivated imprisonment in the Russian Fed-
eration, which violates the commitments of 
the Russian Federation to international obli-
gations with respect to human rights and the 
rule of law; 
(3) urges the United States Government, in 
all its interactions with the Government of 
the Russian Federation, to raise the case of 
Trevor Reed and to press for his release; 
(4) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation to immediately release Trevor 
Reed and all other prisoners arrested for po-
litical motivations; 
(5) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to provide unrestricted consular 
access to Trevor Reed while he remains in 
detention as required under the Vienna Con-
vention on Consular Relations; 
(6) calls on the Government of the Russian 
Federation— 
(A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary 
medical treatment and personal protective 
equipment; 
(B) to notify the United States Embassy in 
Moscow of any medical problems or com-
plaints that arise during his detention; and 
(C) to provide the United States Embassy 
in Moscow with full access to all of Trevor 
Reed’s medical records; 
(7) urges the Government of the Russian 
Federation to respect Trevor Reed’s univer-
sally recognized human rights; and 
(8) expresses support to the family of 
Trevor Reed and commitment to bringing 
Trevor Reed home. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 1115. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 1115, calling for the imme-
diate release of Trevor Reed. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Mr. CONAWAY, for introducing this bi-
partisan resolution. 
In 2019, U.S. citizen and former Ma-
rine Trevor Reed traveled to Russia. 
While on his trip, Moscow’s Police 
Service detained and held Reed for over 
a year. On July 30, 2020, Reed was con-
victed of trumped-up assault charges 
and sentenced to 9 years in a Russian 
prison camp. 
During his sham of a trial, Mr. 
Speaker, traffic camera footage dis-
proved the charges, and even the Rus-
sian judge laughed at the prosecution’s 
absurd attempts to provide evidence. 
Despite this, Trevor Reed’s defense 
team was denied access to additional 
video footage from the police vehicle 
and station that could have provided 
further proof of his innocence. 
While it is no surprise that Putin and 
his cronies didn’t conduct a fair trial, 
it is appalling that Trevor is being held 
without medical treatment during a 
global pandemic and being denied con-
sular access and communication with 
his family. 
H. Res. 1115 not only calls for the im-
mediate release of Trevor, but ex-
presses support for all unjustly de-
tained prisoners in Russia and urges 
U.S. officials to raise Trevor’s case dur-
ing all interactions with the Russian 
Government. The resolution also de-
mands that Russia provide the regular 
consular access and proper medical 
care afforded to Trevor through the Vi-
enna Convention. 
Again, I thank Mr. CONAWAY for his 
commitment to bringing Trevor, a fel-
low Texan, home. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Trevor Reed is a 29- 
year-old Texas resident and former 
United States Marine who served his 
country with distinction. He was an 
Eagle Scout and a Texas Rangers fan, a 
dedicated son and brother.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6091 
December 3, 2020 
He is not a criminal; yet the Putin 
regime treated him like one, sen-
tencing him to 9 years in a Russian 
prison for a crime he did not commit. 
In fact, Trevor was only charged with a 
fabricated crime after the Russian po-
lice discovered that he was a former 
U.S. Marine and, thus, in their eyes, a 
political pawn that could be used. 
The evidence presented in the court-
room during his case was so flimsy 
that it induced laughter from those in 
the room, including the Russian judge. 
What a joke. 
So I stand here today once again to 
call for Trevor Reed’s immediate re-
lease so he can return home to his fam-
ily, where he belongs. 
This is an issue very close to my 
heart. Just a few months ago, Trevor’s 
mother flew out to D.C. to join me and 
Congressman CONAWAY
as we intro-
duced this resolution. Paula told us 
how her son was attending college in 
pursuit of the American Dream before 
Putin took that away from him. And 
she told us how her husband, Joey 
Reed, spends most of his time in Rus-
sia, working every single day to bring 
his son home where he belongs. 
As a father of five myself, I cannot 
imagine being in their shoes, knowing 
their son is suffering in a Russian pris-
on for a crime he did not commit and 
feeling helpless to do anything about 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, Paula and Joey and 
Trevor, they need us. They need their 
Congressmen and -women to fight for 
them today. 
Passing this resolution will send a 
strong message to Putin and his cro-
nies that America will not stand by 
idly as they hold American citizens as 
political 
pawns, 
including 
Michael 
Calvey and Paul Whelan. It will dem-
onstrate that Congress stands firmly 
with Trevor, Paula, Joey, and their en-
tire family, along with the other Amer-
ican hostages abroad, and that we will 
continue to fight until we bring Trevor 
home and give him back his future. 
The holiday season is here upon us 
once again, and Trevor deserves to 
spend this Christmas with his family in 
the comfort of his home, not alone in a 
cold prison cell. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, if I can 
take a point of personal privilege, this 
may be perhaps the last time I appear 
with my dear friend MIKE CONAWAY on 
this distinguished floor. We came in to-
gether, Mr. Speaker, with you, as well. 
I remember it 16 years ago. My, has 
time gone fast. 
But the time you have served, Mike, 
in this Congress and spoken in this 
Chamber, as you chaired the Agri-
culture Committee and served on the 
House Intelligence Committee, sir, let 
me just say how proud I am to call you 
a friend. You have served your country 
and your constituents with honor and 
distinction, and I am proud to have 
served with you and proud to call you 
a friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY), 
the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Texas for yielding 
and for those very kind words. I thank 
Chairman ENGEL and Mr. MCCAUL, the 
ranking member, for bringing this res-
olution forward. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
passage of my resolution calling for the 
immediate release of Trevor Reed. 
For the past 475 days, Trevor Reed, 
an 
eighth-generation 
Texan, 
Eagle 
Scout, and, more importantly, a United 
States Marine veteran, has been held in 
a Russian prison camp for crimes he 
did not commit. 
The Putin regime is clearly using 
Trevor as a political pawn. If they do 
not release him, he will be forced to 
serve an additional 9 years in a Russian 
prison camp, making it almost 10 
years, total, that Trevor and his family 
will endure this nightmare. 
Trevor was initially detained by Mos-
cow’s Police Service in August of 2019 
for public intoxication, but after the 
Russian intelligence agency identified 
him as a U.S. Marine, they upped the 
charge, now accusing him with endan-
gering the lives of two police officers. 
b 1700 
Their claims were undeniably dis-
proved by Trevor’s defense team. The 
accusation, and the lack of evidence to 
support it, was so absurd that even the 
Russian judge erupted in laughter dur-
ing his trial. Yet the judge disregarded 
all evidence, witnesses, and govern-
ment experts by choosing to sentence 
Trevor to the harshest punishment 
ever given for this alleged crime in this 
particular classification. 
Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
repeatedly 
threatened our Nation and bullied our 
allies around the globe. His antagonism 
and animosity towards our country, 
our people, and our ideals holds no 
bounds. 
We are now seeing our own innocent 
citizens and their families caught in 
the middle of Putin’s reprehensible po-
litical games. 
Mr. Speaker, an entire decade of this 
man’s life is at stake. I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution with 
a strong message to Vladimir Putin: 
the House of Representatives solidly 
stands against an American citizen 
being used as a political pawn. Free 
Trevor Reed. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for his kind words again. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. KINZINGER). 
Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for bringing this to the floor. 
When we think about Russian pris-
ons, we don’t often think about justice 
because, frankly, justice is at the whim 
of Vladimir Putin, the man who poi-
sons citizens on NATO territory and 
uses the bludgeon of a hammer to actu-
ally get his will and power. 
So sometimes I think when we as 
Americans look at our political de-
bates, we look at it as a form of dys-
function when, in reality, while the de-
bate can be dysfunctional, it is very 
functional that we are having them. 
But in this case, I think it needs to 
be clear that we stand up for American 
citizens no matter what, and we don’t 
care what their political stripes are 
when they are detained by somebody 
like Vladimir Putin. 
This resolution calls for the imme-
diate release of Trevor Reed. He is a 
U.S. citizen, he is a Marine Corps vet-
eran, and he was unjustly sentenced to 
9 years in a Russian prison. 
He has been detained for over a year 
now on baseless charges filed through 
an overtly corrupt trial. 
His lawyers have been denied access 
to the so-called evidence that the Rus-
sian authorities used to detain Trevor. 
After speaking with his mother, I 
have learned that his family has had a 
difficult time talking to him on the 
phone, limited interaction, because the 
authorities will not let Trevor commu-
nicate in English and they give him 
only a few calls home. 
It is an abuse of power and it is a 
clear attempt by the Russians to make 
an example of Trevor, an American, 
and this must be rectified imme-
diately. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues 
for bringing up this important measure 
to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CONAWAY 
and I thank the chair and ranking 
member. I thank Chairman ENGEL for 
his many, many years of service as well 
on the committee and in this House. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my 
friend and fellow Texan, Representa-
tive CONAWAY, who represents the fam-
ily, for introducing this important res-
olution. 
I have engaged the highest levels of 
government in this case, Trevor’s case, 
from Deputy Secretary Biegun to Spe-
cial Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger 
Carstens. 
And now I am proud to join many of 
my colleagues and fellow Texans from 
both sides of the aisle in supporting 
this resolution and raising more aware-
ness about Trevor’s case. 
So to Trevor and the Reed family, I 
would just like to say to you that 
Texas is with you and America is with 
you. We will stand by you and with you 
here in the Congress every day until we 
finally bring Trevor home. 
So, again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
dear friend, Congressman CONAWAY, 
who sponsored the legislation. I thank 
Chairman ENGEL. 
Another point of personal privilege: I 
think that this will not be the last day

we speak on the floor. I believe on 
Monday we will have another oppor-
tunity to be together, and I would love 
to deliver some special remarks about 
my favorite chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. CON-
AWAY for his work on this bipartisan 
measure that calls on the Russian Gov-
ernment 
to 
drop 
the 
trumped-up 
charges against Trevor Reed and imme-
diately release him from prison. 
Trevor and all those unjustly de-
tained in Russia deserve to be released 
and safely reunited with their families 
for this holiday season. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this measure and I urge all Members to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, let me comment on my 
friend’s remarks. It has been a pleasure 
for me to work with Mr. MCCAUL as the 
ranking member of the committee and 
when he was the chairman. We have 
done incredible work on our com-
mittee, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, working together in a bipar-
tisan way. I am very proud of the work 
we have all done and very proud of the 
work I have done personally with Mr. 
MCCAUL. I know we are going to con-
tinue to fight the good fight, because 
we stand for something. We are so 
blessed to live in this country, and we 
want to make sure that other people 
get the same kinds of freedoms that we 
have. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I support this 
measure, and I urge all Members to do 
the same. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1115, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will con-
trol 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Hawaii. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1049, sponsored by my friend, Rep-
resentative TONKO of New York, a fel-
low member of the Natural Resources 
Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, since 1984, Congress has 
established 55 National Heritage Areas. 
These incredible sites protect our di-
verse historical, cultural, and environ-
mental 
treasures, 
from 
the 
Erie 
Canalway to the Great Basin of Utah 
and 
beyond, 
preserving 
and 
inter-
preting unique aspects of our American 
story. 
Heritage Areas are also a major boon 
for local economies, supporting cul-
tural tourism and driving investment. 
They are also a great deal for the tax-
payer, ensuring that every Federal dol-
lar spent on the program is matched 
with at least $1 of non-Federal funding. 
However, Congress has so far failed 
to pass a law standardizing the man-
agement of this important program, 
meaning that each site operates under 
its own authorization. 
Both the Obama and Trump adminis-
trations have asked Congress to enact 
a programmatic bill to improve site 
management and ensure a continued 
consistent commitment to our Na-
tional Heritage Areas. 
The bill offered today by our col-
league would address that need by pro-
viding a standard under which these 
sites would be designated, reviewed, 
funded, and overseen. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
TONKO for his continued work in sup-
port of our National Heritage Area pro-
gram, and I thank Ranking Member 
BISHOP for working with us to improve 
this bill in committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote in support of H.R. 1049, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
With that mask, it is a lot easier to 
do that, too. 
I appreciate the offer to be involved 
in this lameduck session here today. It 
is one of those things that you have to 
take in some kind of stride. 
One assumes that if you are coming 
back here for a lameduck session, there 
are major issues that need to be done 
before we actually go back and the 
next session of Congress can actually 
take up. Although, I do remember the 
first time I was elected here, we were 
voting in January on the budget from 
the last session of Congress that they 
had failed to do. 
But in all of that, we look at the 
things that are still before us today, 
and they are huge issues: what we are 
going to do with the coronavirus, fund-
ing to help with that problem, national 
defense authorization still yet having 
to be done, appropriations bills still 
yet to be passed. 
Instead of dealing with those this 
week, we find ourselves here with these 
suspensions, most of which will not 
have a chance of actually going all the 
way through the system. Many of them 
should start over again and be done 
separately. But, at any rate, this is 
what we have been called back to do. 
The Germans had a good word for it: 
kleinigkeiten. 
It is those little things. It is not the 
major issues of the day. It is the small 
stuff. Now, admittedly, kleinigkeiten, 
those little things, sometimes can en-
able one to get a victory and they can 
also cause a problem that stops one 
from success. But what we are dealing 
with today here on the floor is a whole 
bunch of kleinigkeiten. So I am happy 
to be invited to be part of this effort 
that is here. 
I also want to say one another thing, 
too, as well, because the bills that are 
on the floor, when they are printed, 
when they are talked about, will have 
the sponsors’ names, Members of the 
House, sometimes Senators who are in-
volved in this, and what is never listed

on here is actually the people who 
make this possible. 
b 1715 
I want to make one mention of the 
staff that we have. It is the staff that 
does the research. It is they who actu-
ally write the bills. It is they who actu-
ally conduct the talking points. It is 
they who organize the session so it can 
run smoothly. 
So the staff that is sitting to your 
left over there does a huge amount of 
work that will never be credited in any 
way, shape, or form, but it should be; 
working into the night to make sure 
that what we do here on the floor is 
possible, and we should recognize them 
and be grateful. 
The staff on my right over here has 
done the same thing. Lisa Pittman, to 
my right, has been here for 33 years 
working in this body, making sure that 
we do things the right way. She will 
have forgotten more than—no offense 
to the Parliamentarians—the Parlia-
mentarians will ever know about how 
to do things properly, effectively, and 
with civility. She works tirelessly 
without asking for the limelight or the 
effort. 
Lisa, at one time, I got you on C– 
SPAN when you had to come down in 
the well and hand me a piece of paper. 
I hope to get you in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD right now. 
To realize that in a month from now 
I am going to be gone and no one cares; 
but a month from now, you will also be 
gone, and there will never be—it will be 
decades before somebody can actually 
replace you. 
So to the staff that is here, the staff 
that is on the floor, the staff that has 
worked on the committee, they should 
be recognized as best we can for the 
work that they do to make everything 
possible. Even though we get the head-
lines and we get the names in bold type 
in the articles, there should be given 
some recognition to staff. 
We have a bill that is before us that 
deals with heritage areas. I congratu-
late the sponsor of this for taking on 
something that needs to be done and, 
even if this does not happen, or if it 
does happen, still has work that needs 
to be done on this topic area. 
The idea of heritage areas was actu-
ally pushed on us by the National Park 
Service, who wanted to find a way of 
stopping all the Members from trying 
to create more national parks in their 
areas; giving them an alternative. 
The idea was to get local govern-
ments coming together and forming a 
cooperative so that they could actually 
use and increase the tourism and the 
opportunities for getting people to 
come and visit these particular areas. 
Now, everything that is done in a na-
tional heritage area does not need the 
Federal Government to be involved. 
Every heritage area could simply, by 
an interlocal cooperation agreement, 
simply come to do everything that hap-
pens in a heritage area. 
The two problems that heritage areas 
have had in the past are dealing with: 
number one, ignoring property rights 
of individuals. The local government 
can solve that problem by themselves. 
They don’t need us to do it. 
Or the idea of assuming responsibil-
ities and powers from local govern-
ments. 
Local 
governments 
in 
an 
interlocal cooperation agreement can 
do that by themselves. They don’t need 
a heritage area to accomplish that. 
But one thing that heritage areas do 
that local governments can’t do by 
themselves is give themselves money 
and that, unfortunately, is why most 
heritage areas exist, because they will 
get $700,000 to $800,000 a year just to 
run these. 
See, this was the nice part about it. 
When this was established in 1994, the 
chairman of the Parks Subcommittee 
was from Minnesota, and he claimed 
that the amount of support is going to 
be limited. There is a limit of time or 
the amount of money that the Federal 
Government can be in a heritage area; 
10 years, we are out of there. And then 
they are on their own, and they will 
get all the benefits of that conserva-
tion. 
The idea was heritage areas would be 
for a limited time with a limited 
amount of money. And as the gen-
tleman from Hawaii suggested, there 
are still 55 heritage areas. Not one of 
them has ever disappeared. Years after 
the time has gone by, they are still 
there and still they are getting that 
$700,000 to $800,000 to run their pro-
grams. 
The heritage areas are no longer 
there to try and get the people so they 
can make things for themselves and 
handle it. Heritage areas are simply a 
drain on the budget that no one wants 
to control. Appropriators don’t try and 
control the spending; authorizers don’t 
try and control the spending. Even the 
administration, though they talk and 
complain about it, don’t try and do it. 
The Clinton administration had a 
problem with this. The Bush adminis-
tration asked us to quit doing heritage 
areas. The Obama administration cut 
the funding for heritage areas in their 
proposed budget by 50 percent. And the 
Trump administration also tried to 
limit what we were doing with heritage 
areas. 
That is the problem. What we do with 
heritage areas makes no sense. It 
doesn’t have value to it. It doesn’t have 
responsibility and we are not even ra-
tional. 
Tennessee has a heritage area for 
Civil War—what is it really called? 
Civil War something. The heritage area 
is the entire State of Tennessee. That 
is illogical. That is not what it was in-
tended to do. 
We have corrupted the idea of herit-
age areas. And I compliment Mr. TONKO 
for what he is trying do. He is saying, 
look, if we are going to have these stu-
pid heritage areas—and it looks like no 
one has the responsibility to actually 
go back and do what we originally in-
tended to do; appropriators won’t, and 
we don’t seem to do it by ourselves— 
then at least have some rational reason 
for why heritage areas are established. 
Have some kind of standard. 
Now, what Mr. TONKO is doing is the 
first step in coming up with some way 
of doing this appropriately. It is not 
near enough. The bill does nothing 
about the root problem of heritage 
areas 
just 
sucking 
up 
$700,000 
to 
$800,000 a year and never, never going 
away, never getting off the Federal 
dole. That still needs to be addressed. 
It doesn’t happen in here. 
But that is why I appreciate Mr. 
TONKO
going forward with this par-
ticular bill because, for once, we need 
to sit back and say, why are we doing 
these heritage areas? What is their pur-
pose? What is their value? 
If we are not doing it in an intel-
ligent way, then all this becomes is 
simply pork barrel for certain people to 
take the money back home to their dis-
trict, pound themselves on the chest 
and say, look what I have done, even 
though it sets the country on a dan-
gerous precedent. 
The Federal Government and our 
Federal spending are in trouble, not be-
cause we spend too much, but we spend 
money on too many things. And that is 
why we, as a Federal Government, have 
to prioritize, and so should heritage 
areas be part of that priority process, 
and we don’t do that. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I say to the gen-
tleman, I appreciate this. Whether this 
gets all the way through, I doubt it. 
But I hope the gentleman will pick it 
up again in the next Congress and con-
tinue to work forward so we try and 
look at these heritage areas and say, 
why are we doing this? What is the pur-
pose? And how can we avoid the objec-
tions, the obsessive, the abuse that has 
happened in many of these areas in the 
future; so that Tennessee cannot be 
one heritage area. 
So the gentleman is really trying to 
get local people to work for their own 
local advantage to appreciate it, and 
make sure that we do it right way. 
So, with that, having tried to empha-
size the fact that this is a huge prob-
lem, I do want to be very clear that I 
support this particular bill and I sup-
port the gentleman’s effort. 
We haven’t gone far enough, to be 
honest. There is an amendment we 
tried to make in the committee which 
would force heritage areas to lower the 
amount of money they keep getting 
from the Federal Government until 
they are finally weaned off the system. 
I still think that is the right thing to 
do. We can talk about that in the fu-
ture because that is an issue still be-
fore us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I certainly appreciate the overview of 
the ranking member in his initial re-
marks today. I would note that the 
bills before us today, these 12 bills, are 
all coming to the floor from the Nat-
ural Resources Committee. They are

critical bills in many areas, from nat-
ural resources to indigenous peoples 
and beyond. 
Many of these bills actually come to 
us from the Senate and, if passed here, 
will go on directly to the President, so 
this is a productive agenda that we 
have here with every expectation that 
these bills will advance. 
I also want to say, on behalf of the 
majority, that I fully endorse the rank-
ing member’s commendations to the 
staff that are with us today and in our 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee. 
He 
makes an important and vital point. 
We all appreciate our staff. We are 
blessed by their service. We are blessed 
by their expertise, and I would be re-
miss if I did not say, on behalf of our 
chair, Chair GRIJALVA, that we all en-
dorse those comments, and I thank him 
for those very kind comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Hawaii for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1049, the National Heritage 
Area Act. I thank Chairman GRIJALVA 
and the staff of the committee for their 
longtime support and effort here. And I 
thank Ranking Member BISHOP for rec-
ognizing the value of this legislation 
and working with us on this. 
The national heritage areas connect 
us, and perhaps more importantly, fu-
ture generations with the voices and 
places that have shaped who we are as 
Americans. These sites deliver more 
than just a significant economic re-
turn; they help us reveal the diverse 
and sometimes hidden gems of our cul-
tural heritage and fill us with a sense 
of place that brings our complex his-
tory to life. 
For the first time, this bill estab-
lishes a standardized set of criteria for 
the designation of new national herit-
age areas and a rigorous process for ex-
isting national heritage areas to ensure 
accountability. 
H.R. 1049 has 221 cosponsors, and 
strong bipartisan, and wide geographic 
support that speaks to the value of this 
program locally and nationally. Mem-
bers recognize what heritage area in-
vestment means to their given commu-
nities and regions, and similar pro-
posals have been introduced and cham-
pioned by both the Bush and Obama ad-
ministrations. 
The National Heritage Area, or NHA, 
program is one of the Department of 
the Interior’s most cost-effective ini-
tiatives, relying on public-private part-
nerships in which every Federal dollar 
is matched with an average of $5.50 in 
other funding. 
For my part, I greatly appreciate the 
good that the Erie Canalway National 
Heritage Corridor and the Maurice D. 
Hinchey Hudson River Valley National 
Heritage Corridor have done for my 
district and for upstate New York. 
I commend the Alliance of National 
Heritage Areas and the National Parks 
Conservation 
Association 
for 
their 
hard work on this critical legislation. 
I also want to thank my friends, our 
former colleague, Charlie Dent, and 
Congressmembers MCKINLEY and G.T. 
THOMPSON, for their hard work on this 
legislation and continued support for 
heritage areas. 
While the ranking member cited staff 
on both sides, I would endorse that. I 
also add to the compliments my legis-
lative person, Emily Silverberg, for the 
outstanding work she has done and her 
longtime dedication and devotion to 
the effort. 
H.R. 1049 is a bipartisan, common-
sense bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Puer-
to Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) will 
control the balance of the time. 
There was no objection. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1049, the Na-
tional Heritage Area Act. 
Since 1984, the National Heritage 
Area program has played a vital role in 
preserving the history, culture and 
natural beauty of our Nation’s most 
historically and naturally significant 
communities. It has worked closely 
with those communities to help make 
them vibrant and ensure their place as 
part of the national landscape. 
In my home State of Rhode Island, 
the Blackstone River Valley National 
Heritage Corridor plays a vital role in 
preserving the history of communities 
in Blackstone Valley, the birthplace of 
the American Industrial Revolution. 
In addition to preserving this his-
tory, the coordinating entity for the 
Blackstone Valley Heritage Corridor 
works hand in hand with the National 
Park Service to support the continued 
development of the Blackstone River 
Valley National Historical Park, which 
runs from Providence and Pawtucket 
through Worcester, Massachusetts. 
I was proud to lead the House effort 
to establish this national park in 2014 
and look forward to seeing its contin-
ued growth and development in close 
coordination with the Blackstone Her-
itage Corridor. 
The relationship between the Black-
stone Heritage Corridor and the Black-
stone Valley National Historical Park 
plays a vital role in telling the story of 
how America became a prosperous na-
tion through its mills and factories, 
and the immigrant communities in 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts that 
worked in those industries and that 
helped build the foundation of our 
country. 
The National Heritage Area Act will 
ensure that this relationship can con-
tinue by authorizing funds for heritage 
areas through 2034 and fostering new 
opportunities for relationships between 
heritage areas and the National Park 
Service to grow. 
While the Trump administration has 
proposed eliminating this critical pro-
gram year after year, I am grateful for 
the work of my colleague from New 
York, Congressman PAUL TONKO, for 
his leadership on this issue. And I 
thank Chairman GRIJALVA
and the 
Natural Resources Committee for their 
efforts to bring this legislation to the 
floor. 
I urge passage of H.R. 1049, to support 
the National Heritage Area program 
and to continue preserving our Na-
tion’s history and natural beauty.

Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 1049, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

LEECH LAKE BAND OF OJIBWE 
RESERVATION RESTORATION ACT 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
199) to provide for the transfer of cer-
tain Federal land in the State of Min-
nesota for the benefit of the Leech 
Lake Band of Ojibwe. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 199 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Leech Lake 
Band of Ojibwe Reservation Restoration 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. LEECH LAKE BAND OF OJIBWE RESERVA-
TION RESTORATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Federal land described in subsection 
(b)(1) was taken from members of the Leech 
Lake Band of Ojibwe during a period— 
(A) beginning in 1948; 
(B) during which the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs incorrectly interpreted an order of the 
Secretary of the Interior to mean that the 
Department of the Interior had the author-
ity to sell tribal allotments without the con-
sent of a majority of the rightful land-
owners; and 
(C) ending in 1959, when the Secretary of 
the Interior was— 
(i) advised that sales described in subpara-
graph (B) were illegal; and 
(ii) ordered to cease conducting those 
sales; 
(2) as a result of the Federal land described 
in subsection (b)(1) being taken from mem-
bers of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, the 
Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe hold the smallest 
percentage of its original reservation lands 
of any Ojibwe bands in Minnesota; 
(3)(A) the applicable statute of limitations 
prohibits individuals from pursuing through 
litigation the return of the land taken as de-
scribed in paragraph (1); but

GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Hawaii. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 199, the Leech Lake 
Band of Ojibwe Reservation Restora-
tion Act, introduced by Senator TINA 
SMITH from Minnesota, directs the De-
partment of Agriculture to transfer ap-
proximately 11,760 acres of Federal 
land in the Chippewa National Forest 
to the Department of the Interior to be 
held in trust for the benefit of the 
Tribe. 
The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe is a 
federally recognized Tribe with ap-
proximately 10,660 members with a res-
ervation located within the National 
Chippewa Forest in Cass County, Min-
nesota. The Leech Lake Band has the 
largest population of all the Minnesota 
Tribes yet the smallest amount of land 
available for its use. 
Much of the Tribe’s land was lost 
when many of its members were ille-
gally dispossessed of their land via 
‘‘secretarial 
transfers’’ 
during 
the 
1950s. Secretarial transfers were a 
transaction where the Department of 
the Interior approved the sale or trans-
fer of Tribal land and/or individually 
owned Indian allotments without the 
consent of the Tribe or the individual 
Indian allottees. This practice resulted 
in the Tribe having insufficient land to 
meet the current needs of its member-
ship. 
The return of the land through S. 199 
will assist the Tribe in rebuilding its 
land base, enable the protection of sa-
cred sites, and allow the construction 
of housing on some of the tracts near 
the Tribe’s existing communities. 
The Tribe intends to respect all ex-
isting easements, rights of way, and 
other encumbrances on the land and 
does not intend to immediately modify 
the current land uses. Additionally, the 
land will stay in tax-exempt fee status 
as part of the Chippewa National For-
est until the Tribe develops a plan for 
future economic and residential use. 
I want to especially commend the 
Tribe for working together with local 
electric co-ops on a memorandum of 
understanding regarding some of the 
last remaining issues so that we could 
bring the bill before us today in a bi-
partisan fashion. 
I want to also extend sincere appre-
ciation to our colleague from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM) for introducing 
the House companion of the legisla-
tion, H.R. 733, and for working dili-
gently with the Natural Resources 
Committee, the Tribe, and the local in-
terests to ensure that passage of this 
bill could become a reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge quick adoption of 
S. 199, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 199, legislation 
that rights a historic wrong made 
against a Tribe in my district, the 
Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe. 
Right after I took office, Chairman 
Jackson and other leaders from the 
Leech Lake Band approached me with 
a longstanding issue. In the 1950s, the 
Secretary of Agriculture claimed land 
owned by Leech Lake under a dubious 
administrative transfer, ignoring pleas 
from the Tribe and upending the Tribal 
tradition of land ownership. 
Landholdings such as these are the 
foundation 
of 
Tribal 
sovereignty. 
Therefore, this wrong had to be righted 
with an act of Congress that transfers 
the roughly 11,000 acres back from the 
Agriculture Department to the Leech 
Lake Band of Ojibwe. 
From the first conversation I had 
with the band, I supported this land ex-
change. This acreage was taken from 
Leech Lake and needed to be returned. 
Unfortunately, the legislation itself 
was flawed. It lacked any language al-
lowing rural utilities access to long-
standing rights of ways and easements 
to ensure maintenance for power and 
other services can be performed. It is 
crucial this transfer is done the right 
way, meaning electric cooperatives de-
livering power have the access they 
need for maintenance. 
Therefore, I worked with the band 
and the rural electric cooperatives to 
achieve a win-win solution. Through a 
years-long negotiation, I am happy to 
see a signed memorandum of under-
standing between Leech Lake and the 
cooperatives delivering service in the 
area, which include Beltrami Electric, 
Lake Country Power, and Crow Wing 
Power. 
After receiving and reviewing the 
memorandum to accompany the bill, I 
supported its passage through the

House Natural Resources Committee. 
With it now on the House floor, I look 
forward to its passage and the Presi-
dent signing the Leech Lake Band of 
Ojibwe Reservation Restoration Act 
into law. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), who is the 
principal introducer of the House com-
panion bill. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my classmate from Hawaii, who 
is overseeing this legislation on the 
floor today. I thank the chairman of 
the full committee as well as the sub-
committee chair and the members of 
the Natural Resources Committee for 
their unanimous support of H.R. 733, 
the House companion to S. 199, the 
Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reserva-
tion Restoration Act. 
I want to thank Leech Lake’s Tribal 
leaders personally for entrusting me 
with the responsibility of advancing 
this bill as the sponsor in the House 
and introducing the bill in the way 
they wanted it to be introduced so that 
they could have negotiations to move 
this language forward. I am proud of 
the ability that we all had in working 
together to make today a reality and 
that we will be voting on this final 
version of the bill. 
As I said, it has passed through the 
Senate, and it passed through the Sen-
ate unanimously. I look forward to see-
ing this legislation signed into law. 
Join me in voting today to restore 
the land that was illegally taken from 
Tribal nations by the Federal Govern-
ment during the allotment era. Today 
we, collectively—the U.S. Congress— 
have an opportunity to correct a past 
injustice by returning the land to the 
Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe that the 
Federal Government sold without the 
consent of the rightful owners, to have 
it returned to them. 
Between 1948 and 1955, approximately 
17,000 acres were illegally transferred 
by the Department of the Interior. The 
bill we are considering today would re-
turn more than 11,000 of those acres to 
the Tribe. The return of this land from 
the Forest Service is vitally important 
to the Leech Lake Band. They cur-
rently own less than 5 percent of the 
land—5 percent of the land—within the 
boundaries of their reservation. This is 
the smallest percentage of any Min-
nesota Tribal nations. 
The Chippewa National Forest holds 
over 75 percent of the land within their 
reservation. Tribal leaders at Leech 
Lake have worked diligently for many 
years in partnership with the Chippewa 
National Forest in Cass County to 
identify the illegally transferred par-
cels of land and to build local support 
for this legislation. They have ad-
dressed concerns with the transfer 
through open dialogue and have cre-
ated a win-win situation for everyone 
involved. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM). 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. The chairman of 
the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has 
sent a letter that describes the injus-
tices that were done when the land was 
illegally taken from Tribal members 
and the efforts that have gone into this 
bill that we will vote on today to cre-
ate that injustice. 
Mr. Speaker, I include this letter in 
the RECORD. 
LEECH LAKE 
BAND OF OJIBWE, 
Cass Lake, MN, November 17, 2020. 
Hon. BETTY MCCOLLUM, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN MCCOLLUM: I write 
on behalf of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe 
to express our thanks to you for sponsoring 
H.R. 733, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Res-
ervation Restoration Act. H.R. 733 will right 
a historical injustice to the Leech Lake peo-
ple by restoring 11,760 acres to tribal trust 
status that the Interior Department illegally 
transferred out of trust more than 70 years 
ago. 
Previously, 
former 
Congressman 
Rick 
Nolan introduced a similar bill in the 115th 
Congress. While the identical companion bill 
passed the Senate by unanimous consent in 
December of 2018, it failed to advance in the 
House of Representatives before the end of 
the session. 
In January of 2019, the Leech Lake Band of 
Ojibwe asked you to reintroduce the Leech 
Lake Reservation Restoration Act to the 
116th Congress. As the former Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Native American Caucus, 
your sponsorship of the bill helped elevate 
the national importance of this legislation 
and highlighted the historic injustice of the 
federal takings of Leech Lake Reservation 
trust lands. 
The Leech Lake Indian Reservation was es-
tablished through a series of treaties with 
the United States and presidential executive 
orders from 1855 to 1874. The initial Leech 
Lake Reservation consisted or 588,684 acres 
of the Band’s homelands and included the 
most valuable red and white pine in the re-
gion. These treaties and executive orders 
promised that the reserved lands would be 
the Band’s permanent homeland. 
The United States violated these promises 
through a series of federal laws and policies 
from 1889 to 1911, moving nearly 530,000 acres 
of our homelands out of trust status. These 
federal actions unilaterally sold off large 
swaths of our Reservation, and separately es-
tablished what is now the Chippewa National 
Forest, all without consent of the Band. 
In the 1940s and 1950s, the federal govern-
ment, through unauthorized administrative 
actions, took approximately 17,000 acres of 
additional Leech Lake Reservation lands 
again without consent of the Band or indi-
vidual tribal landowners. In these agency-to- 
agency transfers, known as ‘‘secretarial 
transfers’’, the Interior Department illegally 
transferred Leech Lake trust lands to the 
USDA-Forest Service. The Interior Depart-
ment put a stop to the illegal transfers in 
1955 when Department attorneys acknowl-
edged that the actions violated federal law. 
Lawsuits were filed to restore these lands to 
trust status in federal courts, but the claims 
were time barred. As a result, the only 
means of achieving justice for the Leech 
Lake Band of Ojibwe is through federal legis-
lation. H.R. 733/S. 199 would restore the por-
tion of these illegal secretarial transfer 
lands located within Cass County back to the 
Interior Department to be held in trust for 
the Band. 
The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has 
worked for many years to identify the ille-
gally transferred land parcels, build local 
support and address any concerns with the 
bill. When it was clear the only recourse to 
recover these lands was federal legislation, 
the Band met on several occasions with lead-
ership of the Chippewa National Forest to 
discuss the issue and draft the bill. The bill 
includes language consistent with the U.S. 
Forest Service’s mission to adhere to na-
tional and local policies regarding the man-
agement of Federal lands. It directs the Sec-
retary to work with the Chippewa National 
Forest Supervisor and the Band to identify 
Federal lands in Cass County near con-
centrations of the Leech Lake population 
and tribal government facilities to ensure 
that transferred lands address the immediate 
needs of the Band and reduce fragmentation 
of federal land holdings. 
In addition, the Band has held several 
meetings with rural electric co-ops and other 
utilities that utilize federal lands to ensure 
the bill would protect rights of way on any 
transferred lands. Through meeting and open 
dialogue, we were able to address the con-
cerns of the ROW permitees and ensure that 
access is maintained not only for citizens of 
our community relying on these essential 
utility services, but also for the companies 
crossing federal lands. 
Thanks to the work in addressing concerns 
with the Leech Lake Reservation Restora-
tion Act, the United States Senate once 
again passed the identical companion bill to 
H.R. 733, S. 199, by unanimous consent in 
June of 2019. Likewise, the House Natural 
Resources Committee approved the bill by 
unanimous voice vote on September 30, 2020. 
Advancing this bill to final passage in the 
U.S. House of Representatives will restore a 
sense of justice that generations of our 
Leech Lake people have been working to 
achieve and provide the Leech Lake Band of 
Ojibwe the necessary land base to combat 
the housing and homelessness, longstanding 
problems that have been highlighted as ur-
gent needs by the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe values 
your friendship and dedication to protecting 
and preserving tribal sovereignty. We look 
forward to continuing our work together on 
this bill and the many other policy issues 
facing Indian Country and our Nation in 
these trying times. 
Sincerely, 
FARON JACKSON, SR., 
Chairman. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, re-
storing this land to the Leech Lake 
reservation will support Tribal commu-
nities while also preserving the area 
for public recreation. It will allow the 
Tribe to consistently apply their forest 
management plan across a greater por-
tion of the reservation. It will also re-
spect all the rights of ways of the util-
ity permits. 
It will be good for Leech Lake Band, 
good for the forest, and good for local 
communities. And it will be good to 
correct a historical injustice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for S. 
199. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as was just explained by 
my colleague across the aisle, S. 199 
would place approximately 11,000 acres 
of Federal land managed by the U.S. 
Forest Service into trust for the Leech 
Lake Band.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6099 
December 3, 2020 
The Tribe and the lands that would 
be held into trust under this bill are lo-
cated in the Eighth Congressional Dis-
trict, which is represented by Repub-
lican Congressman PETE
STAUBER. I 
want to thank Mr. STAUBER for his 
hard work on this legislation because, 
without it, we would not be here today. 
After the House companion bill, H.R. 
733, was introduced by Congresswoman 
MCCOLLUM, it was determined that a 
number of the parcels affected by the 
bills had encumbrances, mainly those 
of public utility co-ops. 
This was, again, another bill that was 
not properly vetted prior to introduc-
tion by a Member from this district. I 
truly believe that, since that time, 
Congressman STAUBER has been a lead-
er in efforts to bring the Tribe and sev-
eral utility co-ops together to come to 
a legal agreement to resolve those 
issues with these easements. 
We have some concerns regarding the 
enforceability of this document but ap-
preciate the willingness of all parties 
to seek a consensus. I think that is the 
important part today, that there is fi-
nally a consensus on this issue. That is 
a policy the Natural Resources Com-
mittee majority has little interest in 
pursuing because, unfortunately, S. 199 
does not reflect this improvement in 
the bill text. Let’s hope the parties will 
continue to act in good faith despite 
this. 
I, again, thank Mr. STAUBER for his 
efforts and the members of the com-
mittee who worked across the aisle to 
make this happen today. I am pleased 
he joined our committee during this 
year. He has been one of the more ac-
tive members of the committee during 
his short tenure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this valuable leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 199. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
INDIAN COMMUNITY ECONOMIC 
ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2020 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
212) to amend the Native American 
Business 
Development, 
Trade 
Pro-
motion, and Tourism Act of 2000, the 
Buy Indian Act, and the Native Amer-
ican Programs Act of 1974 to provide 
industry and economic development 
opportunities to Indian communities, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 212 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Indian Com-
munity Economic Enhancement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1)(A) to bring industry and economic de-
velopment to Indian communities, Indian 
Tribes must overcome a number of barriers, 
including— 
(i) geographical location; 
(ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity; 
(iii) lack of sufficient collateral and cap-
ital; and 
(iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to— 
(I) development; and 
(II) access to services provided by the Fed-
eral Government; and 
(B) the barriers described in subparagraph 
(A) often add to the cost of doing business in 
Indian communities; 
(2) Indian Tribes— 
(A) enact laws and exercise sovereign gov-
ernmental powers; 
(B) determine policy for the benefit of 
Tribal members; and 
(C) produce goods and services for con-
sumers; 
(3) the Federal Government has— 
(A) an important government-to-govern-
ment relationship with Indian Tribes; and 
(B) a role in facilitating healthy and sus-
tainable Tribal economies; 
(4) the input of Indian Tribes in developing 
Federal policy and programs leads to more 
meaningful and effective measures to assist 
Indian Tribes and Indian entrepreneurs in 
building Tribal economies; 
(5)(A) many components of Tribal infra-
structure need significant repair or replace-
ment; and 
(B) access to private capital for projects in 
Indian communities— 
(i) may not be available; or 
(ii) may come at a higher cost than such 
access for other projects; 
(6)(A) Federal capital improvement pro-
grams, such as those that facilitate tax-ex-
empt bond financing and loan guarantees, 
are tools that help improve or replace crum-
bling infrastructure; 
(B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian 
Tribe as a governmental entity under Fed-
eral tax and certain other regulatory laws 
impedes, in part, the ability of Indian Tribes 
to raise capital through issuance of tax ex-
empt debt, invest as an accredited investor, 
and benefit from other investment incen-
tives accorded to State and local govern-
mental entities; and 
(C) as a result of the disparity in treat-
ment of Indian Tribes described in subpara-
graph (B), investors may avoid financing, or 
demand a premium to finance, projects in In-
dian communities, making the projects more 
costly or inaccessible; 
(7) there are a number of Federal loan 
guarantee programs available to facilitate fi-
nancing of business, energy, economic, hous-
ing, and community development projects in 
Indian communities, and those programs 
may support public-private partnerships for 
infrastructure development, but improve-
ments and support are needed for those pro-
grams specific to Indian communities to fa-
cilitate more effectively private financing 
for infrastructure and other urgent develop-
ment needs; and 
(8)(A) most real property held by Indian 
Tribes is trust or restricted land that essen-
tially cannot be held as collateral; and 
(B) while creative solutions, such as lease-
hold mortgages, have been developed in re-
sponse to the problem identified in subpara-
graph (A), some solutions remain subject to 
review and approval by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, adding additional costs and delay to 
Tribal projects.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 212, the Indian Com-
munity Economic Enhancement Act, 
amends current laws to provide indus-
try and economic development oppor-
tunities to Indian communities. 
Indian Tribes face many unique ob-
stacles in their mission to bring indus-
try and economic development to In-
dian Country. This includes geographic 
isolation, lack of infrastructure, and 
lack of sufficient collateral and cap-
ital. The end result is an increased cost 
of doing business in Indian Country, 
which stifles outside investment. 
S. 212 seeks to address these issues by 
amending three existing Federal laws, 
the Native American Business Develop-
ment, Trade Promotion, and Tourism 
Act of 2000, the Buy Indian Act, and the 
Native American Programs Act of 1974. 
These laws have been supporting Na-
tive businesses and economic develop-
ment for years. However, they need to 
be updated to reflect the 21st century 
economy, as well as the realities in In-
dian Country today. 
To that end, enactment of S. 212 will 
increase access to capital for Indian 
Tribes and businesses, increase oppor-
tunities for Indian business promotion, 
and create mechanisms and tools to ad-
dress investments in Indian commu-
nities. 
At the request of the Appropriations 
Committee, we are making some small 
changes to the current bill to update 
the fiscal year authorization language 
for some of the programs. This means 
that the bill will have to go back to the 
Senate, where I hope and believe they 
will move swiftly to enact it, as 
amended, before the end of this Con-
gress. 
b 1745 
I commend the sponsor of the bill, 
the chair of the Senate Committee on 
Indian Affairs, Senator HOEVEN from 
North Dakota, for his work on this leg-
islation. 
I also recognize our own colleague, 
Representative NORMA
TORRES
from 
California for her work on the bill and 
for carrying the House companion, 
H.R. 1937. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 
212, and I ask for its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRIJALVA: I write con-
cerning S. 212, the Indian Community Eco-
nomic Enhancement Act of 2019. This bill 
was primarily referred to the Committee on 
Natural Resources, and additionally to the 
Committee on Education and Labor. As a re-

The Committee on Education and Labor 
takes this action with our mutual under-
standing that by forgoing formal consider-
ation of S. 212, we do not waive any jurisdic-
tion over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and we will be ap-
propriately consulted and involved as the 
bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
we may address any remaining issues within 
our Rule X jurisdiction. I also request that

COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, November 30, 2020. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chair, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR SCOTT: I write to you con-
cerning S. 212, the ‘‘Indian Community Eco-
nomic Enhancement Act of 2019.’’ 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this legislation. I recognize that 
the bill contains provisions that fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. I acknowledge that your 
Committee will not formally consider S. 212 
and agree that the inaction of your Com-
mittee with respect to the bill does not 
waive any future jurisdictional claim over 
the matters contained in the bill that fall 
within your Committee’s Rule X jurisdic-
tion. 
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is 
included in the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate 
your cooperation regarding this legislation 
and look forward to continuing to work with 
you as this measure moves through the legis-
lative process. 
Sincerely, 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, 
House Natural Resources Committee. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important 
that, for decades, the Native American 
communities have struggled with a 
wide array of difficulties relating to 
economic development on their own 
land, including poor access to capital, 
remote and rural locations, and deg-
radation of the local infrastructure. 
Only around half of all Native Ameri-
cans residing or near Tribal commu-
nities have jobs, and a quarter of Na-
tive families earn an income that is 
below the American poverty line. 
Tribal economic development is also 
hampered by the need for Federal ap-
proval before leasing of trust lands, 
legal systems that are not business 
friendly, and issues raised by sovereign 
immunity. 
This bill, S. 212, amends three Fed-
eral laws relating to business, eco-
nomic, and trade development in In-
dian communities: the Native Amer-
ican Business Development, Trade Pro-
motion, and Tourism Act of 2000, the 
Buy Indian Act, and the Native Amer-
ican Programs Act of 1974. 
The amendments are intended to in-
crease access to capital for Indian 
Tribes and businesses, increase oppor-
tunities for Indian business promotion, 
and create mechanisms and tools to at-
tract investments in Indian commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully support the in-
tent behind this legislation and appre-
ciate the work that has gone into it 
over the last several years. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I very much 
appreciate the comments of my col-
league from Puerto Rico. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here today in support of the legislation 
before us, the ‘‘Indian Community Economic 
Enhancement Act,’’—the Senate companion to 
my bill in the House. 
For too long, lack of access to credit and 
community development have hampered the 
entrepreneurial spirit of Native American 
tribes. Yet, across the country, Native Amer-
ican entrepreneurs are ready to start new 
businesses, create jobs, and lift up their com-
munities. 
My bill is a first step to change that. It up-
dates and provides new resources to the De-
partment of Commerce’s Office of Native 
American Business Development. It ensures 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices is using Native American labor and indus-
try products when appropriate. And, it author-
izes the Administration for Native Americans 
to provide key financial assistance to Native 
American community development financial in-
stitutions. 
I want to thank my friend Congresswoman 
HAALAND for co-leading this bill with me, and 
Senator HOEVEN, Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, for introducing 
and shepherding this bill in the Senate. 
The American people and Native commu-
nities, should be reassured that there is bipar-
tisan commitment to improving lives in Indian 
Country. 
I urge my colleagues, to vote yes and join 
us in empowering the Native American entre-
preneurs and communities who are building 
solutions for a better tomorrow. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 212, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico 
(Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Hawaii. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 914, the Coordinated 
Ocean Observations and Research Act, 
would 
reauthorize 
the 
Integrated 
Coastal and Ocean Observation System 
Act of 2009, called IOOS for short. 
For over 10 years now, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion, or NOAA, has implemented this 
data-driven national regional partner-
ship to successfully improve safety, en-
hance the economy, and protect the en-
vironment. 
IOOS is a coordinated network of 
people and technology consisting of 
Federal partners and regional associa-
tions that generates and disseminates 
continuous data and models for our 
oceans and the Great Lakes. These 
data give us a crucial understanding of 
environmental variables, like tempera-
ture, salinity, currents, nutrient con-
centrations, contaminant levels, and 
more. 
This bill would also clarify the au-
thority of NOAA in regards to post- 
storm assessments, which NOAA has 
been doing the work for since it was 
appropriated funds in 2016. The bill 
makes technical challenges to the 
COASTAL Act of 2012 so that NOAA 
can successfully collect the required 
data to perform post-storm assess-
ments and then provide that informa-
tion to FEMA. 
And finally, this legislation would 
codify establishment of the National 
Water Center as the primary facility 
for hydrologic decision support serv-
ices. As we saw from the historic flood-
ing events last year, it is critical that 
NOAA has these decision support tools. 
In the face of climate change, it is so 
important 
that 
our 
environmental 
planners and managers have the tools 
they need to ensure safety for the 
American people and the longevity of 
our coastal natural resources. The Co-
ordinated Ocean Observations and Re-
search Act will put us on that path. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 914. 
This bill, the Coordinated Ocean Ob-
servations and Research Act, will reau-
thorize the U.S. Integrated Ocean Ob-
serving System, better known as IOOS, 
and increase Federal support for ocean 
data collection and monitoring efforts, 
which are vital to coastal and island 
communities across the Nation. 
Why this bill is important is, as you 
may know, living in Puerto Rico and 
after the hurricanes, this program, it 
was so important for communities in 
the Caribbean as well as many other 
coastal communities across the Nation. 
This network consists of 17 Federal 
agencies and 11 regional associations 
that provide quality information about 
our coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes. 
And through the use of tools such as 
satellites, buoys, and underwater glid-
ers, the system delivers accurate data 
that is critical to support coastal 
economies, maritime commerce, and 
navigation safety. 
These products are also used to im-
prove hurricane tracking and weather 
forecasts, monitor water quality, con-
duct research on coastal ecosystems, 
and support the U.S. Coast Guard 
search and rescue operations. That was 
the reason I was supporting this, and, 
of course, the dean of the House, Mr. 
DON YOUNG, who is showing the way for 
many of us arriving to the House after 
him. 
In the case of Puerto Rico, we know 
firsthand the importance of this sys-
tem. The Caribbean Coastal Ocean Ob-
serving 
System 
is 
one 
of 
the 
networks’s 
11 
regional 
associations 
that is based on the island. Among 
other things, it helps support port and 
harbor operations, as well as inter-
island shipping and cruising, by pro-
viding observations and models of 
coastal weather, waves, wind, and cur-
rents in the waters surrounding Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
These system assets were particu-
larly instrumental when Hurricanes 
Irma and Maria struck in 2017. While 
Puerto Rico was without power and 
communications, our buoys kept re-
porting data via satellite, providing 
crucial information that was utilized 
by NOAA’s National Hurricane Center 
in Miami and other stakeholders. Re-
authorizing this system network is 
necessary to continue supporting this 
and other similar efforts across the 
country and to ensure that we are de-
livering accurate and continuous data 
on our oceans and coast. 
Mr. Speaker, I should mention, as 
well, that while we are taking up a 
Senate bill, the dean of the House, DON 
YOUNG, has been a dedicated supporter 
of this program for many, many years 
and has sponsored a House companion 
bill. You may have all heard that the 
dean of the House recently tested posi-
tive for COVID, as I did in August, and 
we are all hoping that he remains 
strong, as he is, fierce, and well after 
his resounding reelection victory. 
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I know 
many folks living in coastal commu-
nities around the Nation will benefit 
from the enactment of this legislation 
here today. So not just by the people 
living in the islands or in coastal com-
munities, but in solidarity with Con-
gressman YOUNG, I urge the adoption of 
the measure and reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
do deeply appreciate the comments of 
my colleague from Puerto Rico, and 
she knows, as well as I do, as members 
of the Island Caucus—and we include in 
the Island Caucus the largest island of 
all, Alaska, Mr. YOUNG’s island—the 
deep importance of this system. It is a 
matter of life and death to us in many 
areas and many ways, and so we all 
fully endorse this bill from that per-
spective.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6108 
December 3, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), dean of the House. 
(Mr. YOUNG asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good chairwoman for yielding the 
time and my good friend on the other 
side from Hawaii, one of my brother 
States, for this piece of legislation; 
Congresswoman BONAMICI for a very bi-
partisan 
bill 
with 
Senator 
ROGER 
WICKER, DAN SULLIVAN, involved in this 
legislation. It has been hard work, 
dedication to our coasts, our oceans, 
and the Great Lakes. 
Mr. Speaker, we sometimes forget, 
we hear a lot about climate change, et 
cetera, but one of the biggest chal-
lenges we have is the condition of our 
oceans and how we can clean it up, but 
only keep that in your mind so maybe 
we can go forth in the future to really 
solve some of these problems, espe-
cially with the plastics. 
This bill, which includes technical 
changes implemented by the Senate, 
would 
reauthorize 
the 
Integrated 
Coastal and Ocean Observation System 
Act through the fiscal year of 2024. 
The 11 regional association networks 
of the Integrated Ocean Observing Sys-
tem work with regional partners to de-
velop, operate, and maintain more than 
300 observing assets that collect ocean-
ographic and coastal data, including 
information about rising sea levels, 
coastal flooding, and harmful algal 
blooms. 
This program is a simple system with 
multiple uses. 
I will say that a cost-effective ap-
proach of fulfilling this Nation’s need 
for coastal data is very important. 
The data from these systems enables 
the Coast Guard to reduce the size of 
their search areas by two-thirds. The 
data is also used for tracking oil spills, 
providing mariners with sea state con-
ditions, and for ship detection. 
During the Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill, IOOS regions responded by de-
ploying high-frequency radars and un-
derwater gliders to the region to assist 
with monitoring the spill. IOOS data 
standards enabled the Federal com-
mand 
center 
to 
use 
non-Federal 
sources of data for the first time. 
NOAA’s Office of Response and Res-
toration now routinely uses this data 
in their oil spill response. 
It also provides core observations for 
water level, waves, winds, et cetera, 
and it helps to protect against flooding 
and surges of the sea. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipar-
tisan piece of legislation. I hope it will 
save lives. 
We just had an instance in Haines, 
Alaska, where huge waves and rain de-
stroyed a lot of our coastal areas. That 
just happened yesterday. This will help 
us try to make sure that we would have 
known that ahead of time. 
It will save us money. 
I would really like to congratulate 
everybody here on a bipartisan piece of 
legislation. It is long overdue. We will 
get the problems solved with oceans. 
This is a good piece of legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this invaluable 
legislation for our oceans and all of us, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, as Co-Chair 
of the House Oceans Caucus, I rise in support 
of S. 914, a bill to reauthorize and increase 
funding for the Integrated Coastal and Ocean 
Observation System. 
The ocean covers more than 70 percent of 
the planet, but despite our intrinsic connection 
to our ocean we know very little about what is 
beneath its surface. The eleven Integrated 
Ocean Observing System regional networks 
use satellites, buoys, underwater gliders, and 
tide gauges to deliver accurate and continuous 
data on our ocean and coasts. I was pleased 
to work with my House Oceans Caucus Co- 
Chair, Congressman DON
YOUNG, on the 
House companion to reauthorize these impor-
tant ocean observation efforts. 
Coastal communities, like those I represent 
in Northwest Oregon, rely on accurate ocean 
data and monitoring for information about 
ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms and 
hypoxia, sea level rise, flooding, navigation, 
and port security. In the Pacific Northwest, we 
are fortunate to have the Northwest Associa-
tion of Networked Ocean Observing Systems 
leading the way. Tribes, commercial fisheries, 
emergency responders, and public health offi-
cials rely on the free and open access data 
collected by NANOOS to learn about threats 
to the health of our ocean. I am excited about 
the partnership between NANOOS and the 
Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission 
that focuses on the Center for Coastal Margin 
Observation and Prediction and will help to 
further our understanding of ocean-estuary 
interactions. I appreciate the continued innova-
tion from NANOOS to meet the needs of our 
communities along the Pacific Coast and the 
Columbia River. 
I am also pleased that this bill directs NOAA 
to conduct a vulnerability assessment to iden-
tify communities that are dependent on coastal 
and ocean resources and that may be affected 
by ocean acidification. I am grateful for the bi-
partisan support for strengthening our under-
standing of the socioeconomic effects of 
ocean acidification on a range of geographi-
cally diverse coastal communities, and I look 
forward to continuing to work with my col-
leagues on this issue. 
To protect and preserve one of our planet’s 
greatest natural resources, we must rapidly 
accelerate the collection, management, and 
dissemination of ocean data collection and 
monitoring. I recently joined my colleagues on 
the House Select Committee on the Climate 
Crisis in releasing a bold, science-based com-
prehensive Climate Action Plan to set our na-
tion on a path to net-zero emissions no later 
than midcentury and net-negative thereafter. 
I’m thrilled that our plan for solving the climate 
crisis recognizes the power of our ocean as 
part of the solution. Our Climate Action Plan 
specifically includes the Coordinated Ocean 
Observations and Research Act to strengthen 
ocean observations. 
Thank you to NANOOS for their efforts to 
accurately predict, model, and manage ocean 
observation data that support the needs of our 
region. I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 914, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy today 
to rise in support of S. 1342, the Great 
Lakes 
Environmental 
Sensitivity 
Index Act. I commend my colleagues, 
Senators Peters and Young and Rep-
resentatives Kildee and Joyce, for their 
bipartisan, bicameral efforts on this 
legislation. 
The Great Lakes are the largest 
freshwater system by area in the world 
and are home to highly productive 
commercial and recreational fisheries, 
thriving 
coastal 
communities, 
and 
unique aquatic and terrestrial species. 
This legislation ensures that the 
Great Lakes are not left behind in en-
vironmental planning. The bill requires 
that the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration, or NOAA, up-
date at least once every 7 years its en-
vironmental sensitivity index products 
for each coastal area of the Great 
Lakes. 
These environmental sensitivity in-
dexes, or ESI maps, are crucial tools 
used in identifying sensitive coastal 
shorelines, biological resources, and 
human-use resources prior to a disaster 
like an oil spill. In emergencies, coast-
al managers and responders can then 
use these ESI maps to properly assess 
the situation, allocate and prioritize 
resources, and plan cleanups. 
The last time the Great Lakes envi-
ronmental sensitivity indexes were up-
dated was in the 1980s. As we all know, 
between the climate crisis and human 
development, 
our 
environment 
has 
changed dramatically across our coun-
try and world in that time. 
In the Great Lakes, for example, we 
are seeing record-setting water levels 
and harmful algal blooms. How these 
environmental factors would interact 
with a disaster like an oil spill is, un-
fortunately, largely guesswork with 
our outdated information. 
It is so important that we pass this 
much-needed, commonsense legislation 
so that the Great Lakes region is pre-
pared in the event of an unthinkable 
oil spill or other natural disaster. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the Great Lakes 
Environmental Sensitivity Index Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
HUIZENGA). 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, in the 
midst of a divided Washington, D.C., it 
is important that Congress comes to-
gether to prioritize the protection of 
the Great Lakes. 
As co-chair of the bipartisan Great 
Lakes Task Force, building bipartisan 
consensus that preserves the Great 
Lakes, strengthens their economy, and 
protects them for future generations 
has been one of my top priorities. 
While the environmental sensitivity 
index maps may not be the headline- 
grabbing legislation that we are some-
times used to, these maps are critical 
to the communities across the Great 
Lakes. 
We must have accurate assessments 
of coastal resources that are at risk of 
severe damage from an emergency or a 
natural disaster. These environmental 
assessments include information on en-
dangered and threatened species, vul-
nerable shorelines, and widely used 
community resources, such as beaches, 
parks, and boat ramps. 
The maps are vital to disaster plan-
ning, as well as recovery, research, and 
restoration efforts. It is essential that 
we have an accurate representation of 
vulnerable locations and areas in the 
Great Lakes that are in need of protec-
tion in the event of an emergency. 
While maps for the East Coast, the 
West Coast, and the Gulf Coast have all 
been updated recently, maps for the 
Great Lakes have not been updated in 
over 20 years. 
To be clear, while the Great Lakes 
holds over 20 percent of the world’s 
fresh water, providing drinking water 
to more than 48 million people, it sup-
ports over 1.3 million jobs, and gen-
erates billions upon billions of dollars 
in economic activity. Yet, as I stated 
before, our region hasn’t had a proper 
environmental map update in more 
than two decades. 
This legislation, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor, would solve this prob-
lem by modernizing and updating our 
maps of the Great Lakes. 
Along Lake Michigan and throughout 
the Great Lakes shoreline, the current 
state of erosion and high water damage 
is at a crisis point. 
In my district, along the shores of 
Lake Michigan, the high water levels 
are 
threatening 
not 
only 
people’s 
homes and public infrastructure but 
the overall ecology and the economy of 
the Great Lakes. 
Communities throughout the region 
have declared states of emergency as 
roads, bridges, harbors, and wastewater 
treatment facilities, just to name a 
few, are in danger due to these high 
water levels. 
As we continue to see disasters and 
emergencies in the Great Lakes region, 
government, at all levels, must be pre-
pared and have up-to-date information 
to act upon. This bipartisan bill would 
accomplish that, while demonstrating 
another way my Michigan colleagues 
and I, and really all of us from the 
Great Lakes region, are making sure 
the Federal Government prioritizes and 
protects 
and 
preserves 
the 
Great 
Lakes. 
Whether it is responding to rapidly 
evolving events, such as a natural dis-
aster, or planning long-term projects, 
such as habitat restoration, we need to 
have reliable and accurate information 
available to all the players. 
When it comes to protecting our 
lakes, habitats, and shorelines, these 
updated maps will allow us to better 
prepare to face natural disasters or 
emergencies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA). 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, having 
this updated information will help us 
analyze and assess the threats facing 
the Great Lakes and allow us to be 
more proactive instead of 100 percent 
reactive. 
The Great Lakes are a way of life for 
many of us in west Michigan and 
throughout the Great Lakes system, 
and these pristine resources help define 
who we are as a community and a peo-
ple. I will continue to work, support, 
and advocate for commonsense reforms 
like today’s legislation that will pro-
tect these incredible natural resources 
for generations to come. 
I do want to thank my fellow col-
leagues who have been working on this, 
Mr. KILDEE from Michigan, Mr. JOYCE 
from Ohio, and the rest of the Great 
Lakes Task Force. This has been a 
great, true bipartisan success story, as 
we have looked at increasing funding 
for protecting the Great Lakes through 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, 
the GLRI, as well as initiatives like 
this. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE), the co-introducer of 
this important legislation. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise also 
in support of S. 1342, the Great Lakes 
Environmental Sensitivity Index Act 
of 2020. 
I was proud to introduce this legisla-
tion here in the House with my Michi-
gan colleagues and also with Senator 
GARY PETERS, a Great Lakes champion 
on the other side of the building. Dur-
ing his time in the House and the Sen-
ate, GARY PETERS has been a staunch 
advocate for the Great Lakes, and I ap-
preciate his efforts over there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6110 
December 3, 2020 
Mr. Chairman, I represent 118 miles 
of beautiful Lake Huron shoreline. In 
Congress, I am proud to lead the bipar-
tisan effort on this legislation to pro-
tect the Great Lakes. 
This legislation, as has been stated, 
would update and prioritize environ-
mental sensitivity index maps for the 
Great Lakes. These environmental sen-
sitivity maps are detailed guides that 
highlight vulnerable locations, struc-
tures, and natural resources along our 
lakeshore. 
First responders use these maps to 
respond in case of emergency and to 
protect habitat, species, and structures 
that are most likely to be impacted by 
an oil spill or some other disaster. 
If one of those disasters occurs in the 
Great Lakes, our emergency responders 
must have the most up-to-date maps 
and information in order to respond 
quickly and effectively. 
These 
maps 
are 
maintained 
by 
NOAA. Some maps in the Great Lakes, 
however, have not been updated in dec-
ades. That is why this legislation is 
necessary, so that our first responders 
have the most up-to-date information 
to do their jobs effectively. We can’t 
have one hand tied behind our back 
when protecting the Great Lakes. 
The Great Lakes are important to all 
of us. They support many jobs, gen-
erate billions of dollars in economic ac-
tivity, and provide drinking water to 40 
million people. We have to do every-
thing we can to protect them. 
It also defines literally who we are. If 
you are from Michigan, you can hold 
up your hand, and the contour of the 
lakes really defines the shape of our 
State. 
I would like to thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA and Chairman HUFFMAN for their 
help in getting this to the floor today. 
I want to thank my own staff, Jordan 
Dickinson. I want to thank Rachel 
Gentile from the Natural Resources 
Committee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, finally, I 
want to thank my colleagues, the co-
sponsors on this legislation, Represent-
ative HUIZENGA, who we have heard 
from; Representative DINGELL; Rep-
resentative JOYCE; and Representative 
STEVENS. 
This is, as Mr. HUIZENGA said, one of 
those issues that allows us to cut 
across the normal divides. We work 
well together in a bipartisan fashion to 
protect the Great Lakes. This legisla-
tion is another example of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Great 
Lakes 
Environmental 
Sensitivity 
Index Act of 2020. 
I was proud to join Representative 
KILDEE in introducing this bill to di-
rect the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration to update the 
environmental sensitivity index maps 
for the Great Lakes for the first time 
in many years. 
ESI maps document the potential im-
pacts from coastal resiliency threats 
such as oil spills, coastal flooding, and 
storm damage from high lake levels, 
which have recently plagued many 
communities in my district. 
Having grown up and lived my entire 
life along the shores of Lake Erie, I 
know that the Great Lakes are a na-
tional treasure, an economic power-
house, and one of the United States’ 
greatest natural resources. 
As the largest system of surface fresh 
water on Earth, the Great Lakes pro-
vide drinking water for an estimated 48 
million people, support more than 1.5 
million jobs, and generate $60 billion in 
wages annually. That is why it is im-
portant that we work together to pro-
tect and preserve the lakes and the 
communities they sustain. This legisla-
tion will help us do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill today. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, the Senate passed 
this bill twice, without even holding a 
hearing. The House has not taken any 
action on its version of the bill, H.R. 
2551, even though it has been referred 
to the Natural Resources Committee 
since last May. 
The Senate Committee report on S. 
1342 justified its need by stating that 
the environmental sensitivity index 
maps for the Great Lakes haven’t been 
updated since the 1980s. It also states 
the maps haven’t been updated since 
between 1985 and 2004. It just depends 
on which paragraph of the report you 
read. 
Clearly, no one knows or could be 
bothered to find out when these maps 
were updated. Apparently, it doesn’t 
matter for some people. 
CBO scores this bill as costing tax-
payers $2 million, but we have no idea 
where the administration is on this 
issue. No money was appropriated for 
these indexes in 2019, and, clearly, we 
don’t have an answer to those ques-
tions still in this report. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 1342, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
KETTLE CREEK BATTLEFIELD 
SURVEY ACT 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 306) to direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to conduct a special resource 
study of the site of the Kettle Creek 
Battlefield in Wilkes County, Georgia, 
and adjacent property, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 306 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. KETTLE CREEK BATTLEFIELD SUR-
VEY.

ferred to in this section as the ‘‘Secretary’’) 
shall conduct a reconnaissance survey of the 
site of the Kettle Creek Battlefield in Wilkes 
County, Georgia, and adjacent property (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘site’’). 
(2) REQUIREMENTS
FOR
SURVEY.—In con-
ducting the survey under paragraph (1), the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico 
(Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
306, the Kettle Creek Battlefield Sur-
vey Act, introduced by our colleague, 
Representative JODY HICE. 
This bill would require the Secretary 
of the Interior to conduct a reconnais-
sance survey of the Kettle Creek Bat-
tlefield in Wilkes County, Georgia. 
On February 14, 1779, at the Battle of 
Kettle Creek, approximately 350 patri-
ots defeated more than 800 British loy-
alists in a surprise attack. The battle

marked the only significant victory in 
Georgia by forces opposed to British 
rule and impacted the course of the 
American Revolutionary War. 
In 1975, the battlefield was added to 
the 
National 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places to protect the site’s historic and 
archeological resources. 
This bill tasks the National Park 
Service with determining the best 
management options for these historic 
resources, and I would like to thank 
Representative HICE for his efforts on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support its adoption, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
HICE), who is the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Speaker and am grateful for 
the bipartisan support for this bill. 
I want to say a special thank you to 
the ranking member, Mr. BISHOP. It 
has been an honor to serve under him, 
both as the ranking member and the 
chairman of this committee. His lead-
ership will be greatly missed. It has 
been an honor to serve with him and 
under his leadership, and I wish him 
the best in the years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I think most Americans 
are very familiar with great military 
moments in our Nation’s past and our 
history, and all of us could name dif-
ferent places where some of those 
memorable battles occurred. But many 
of the Nation’s finest moments took 
place right here in our own backyard, 
and many people are not even aware of 
some of those battles. 
One of those took place in the other 
Washington, Washington, Georgia, in 
Wilkes County. As briefly was de-
scribed, on February 14, 1779, there was 
a sizable force of British loyalists who 
collided with a small but ferocious 
band of American patriots. They were 
led by Colonel Andrew Pickens in the 
Kettle Creek area. They were out-
numbered 2 to 1, and Colonel Pickens 
and his men suddenly attacked the 
Tory militia, catching them by sur-
prise. It was a bloody battle, a severe 
battle, a brutal fight, but it ended up 
being one of the greatest victories in 
the southern campaign during the rev-
olutionary time. This battle involved 
only a few hundred men, but the im-
pact is enormous on the entire Revolu-
tionary War. 
In fact, Colonel Pickens himself said 
of the Battle of Kettle Creek: ‘‘I be-
lieve it was the severest check and 
chastisement the Tories ever received 
in South Carolina or Georgia.’’ 
This engagement demonstrated con-
clusively that while the British could 
hold areas and cities like Savannah or 
Charleston, they could never grasp 
hold of the southern backcountry. 
The courage shown by the out-
numbered patriots is nothing shy of ab-
solutely legendary, and they are still 
honored in Georgia today. One of those 
stories that I would like to share today 
is of an individual named Austin 
Dabney. 
Despite being a slave, Mr. Dabney 
served with honor and distinction in 
the patriot military until he was shot 
in the thigh in the Battle of Kettle 
Creek. Though crippled and returned to 
servitude, Mr. Dabney’s actions were 
never forgotten. In fact, after the war, 
in 1786, an official act of the Georgia 
legislature emancipated Mr. Dabney, 
and they granted him both land and a 
lifetime pension. This only scratches 
the surface of Mr. Dabney’s story. Yet, 
it is something that we need never to 
forget. 
Kettle Creek was added to the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places in 
1975, and the 2007 report to Congress by 
the American Battlefield Protection 
Program of the National Park Service 
noted the Battle of Kettle Creek hav-
ing demonstrable influence on the 
course, conduct, and results of the Rev-
olutionary War. 
Congress has made significant strides 
in preserving many of the battlefields 
of the Civil War, but I think, unfortu-
nately, many of the battlefields of the 
Revolutionary War have been forgot-
ten. We need to remember those. 
This legislation is critical to not 
only preserving Kettle Creek, which 
has, by the way, tremendous support in 
the community and the State, but I 
strongly believe that the stories of 
both Colonel Pickens and the incred-
ible stories of people like Austin 
Dabney are worth saving. They are 
worth saving for generations to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to Kettle 
Creek being studied for inclusion in the 
National Park System. I appreciate my 
colleagues’ support for this and urge 
the rest of our colleagues to support 
this piece of history and this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
do appreciate my colleague’s very emo-
tional description of the rich history of 
Battle Creek and his commitment to 
its preservation. I join him in that. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, is 
there any time remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Utah has 15 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HICE for ev-
erything that he is doing on this par-
ticular bill. He left already. He is the 
one who has the accent. But I have to 
admit, back where I live, this would be 
called Kettle Crick, not Kettle Creek, 
so if you can make that change. 
But the problem is, obviously, battle-
fields are disappearing. What Mr. HICE 
has done is try to go about this the 
proper way, by doing the study that 
sets the parameters of what we need, 
and with a great deal of concern and 
consideration for the other people who 
are living in that area, for private 
property in that area, for the other 
concerns that take place in there. 
So, I am proud of this because Mr. 
HICE is doing it the right way. This is 
the way all of our studies should take 
place. This is the way all of our con-
cerns should take place, and it is ap-
propriate. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the adoption of this measure, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

ice Commissioned Corps. 
The bill before us today is led by a 
Republican, 
Alaskan 
Senator 
SUL-
LIVAN. It passed through the Senate 
committee and the Senate itself by 
unanimous consent. It is a virtual com-
panion with improvements to H.R. 2406, 
which was introduced by me and both 
Democratic and Republican colleagues, 
and reported out of our Natural Re-
sources Committee. 
If passed today, it will go straight to 
the President, whose Department of 
Commerce testified to our Natural Re-
sources Committee: ‘‘The Department 
believes 
this 
bill 
would 
improve 
NOAA’s 
ability 
to 
administer 
the 
NOAA Corps. The Department is very 
supportive of the ability to retain vet-
erans of the NOAA Corps and the 
unique skill sets they possess. The Of-
fice of Management and Budget has ad-
vised that there is no objection to the 
transmittal of these views, from the 
standpoint of the administration’s pro-
grams.’’ 
The bill is also supported whole-
heartedly by two of our Nation’s fore-
most servicemember organizations, the 
350,000-strong Military Officers Asso-
ciation of America, representing all 
military officers of all services, and the 
5.5-million-strong Military Coalition, 
whose motto is, ‘‘Proudly serving all 
seven uniformed services.’’ 
In fact, but for the isolated objec-
tions of a few Members, which we may 
hear from shortly, which appear to 
arise from some combination of a fun-
damental misunderstanding or lack of 
appreciation for the mission of NOAA 
and its Uniformed Officer Corps, one 
could scarcely imagine a more broadly 
supported measure. 
The National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration, or NOAA, cele-
brates its half-century anniversary this 
year as ‘‘America’s environmental in-
telligence agency.’’ Never, during that 
half-century, has its mission been so 
important, and never has it been grow-
ing so fast. 
NOAA now operates oceanic observa-
tion 
and 
research 
throughout 
our 
world’s oceans, measuring the health of 
our oceans, the health of our fisheries, 
and weather prediction. It operates at-
mospheric research and observation, 
weather prediction, and, again, na-
tional hazard warnings. 
It operates fisheries enforcement in-
creasingly throughout our world, in-
cluding in partnership with our friends 
and allies. It increases partnerships 
with foreign countries, projecting part 
of our soft power throughout this 
world. It does its vital work with a 
critical team, including the structured, 
uniformed Commissioned Officer Corps. 
The women and men of the NOAA 
Corps operate NOAA’s highly special-
ized international fleet of research and 
survey ships and aircraft. They con-

and atmospheric research, including 
the famous Hurricane Hunter aviators 
who fly into, above, and around hurri-
canes to give NOAA’s National Weath-
er Service forecasters accurate data for 
their storm forecasts and warnings 
used by emergency managers as they 
make life and death decisions. 
Like the other uniformed services, 
Active Duty NOAA Corps officers spend 
most of their careers away from home, 
at sea, in the air, and in remote loca-
tions such as Antarctica, conducting 
this important work. Their work is fre-
quently in increasingly hazardous con-
ditions. 
However, the corps is often over-
looked in the legislative process, re-
sulting in a patchwork of statutory au-
thorities, benefits, and service obliga-
tions. 
This bill will help the NOAA Corps 
improve recruitment, retention, and di-
versity to attract the best and the 
brightest commissioned officers and 
better align the NOAA Corps with the 
other uniformed services as they con-
tinue their service to NOAA and our 
Nation. 
b 1830 
The NOAA Corps Amendments Act is 
an important step to make sure that 
the NOAA Corps has the authority it 
needs to continue as an effective serv-
ice for our country. 
The bill gives the NOAA Corps offi-
cers employment rights in line with 
other uniform services, authorizes edu-
cation loan repayment programs for 
NOAA Corps officers, tuition support 
for 
prospective 
officers, 
and 
gives 
NOAA updated authority to manage 
the size and composition of the corps. 
In their letter supporting the NOAA 
Corps Amendments Act, the Military 
Officers Association of America, the 
Nation’s leading voice for commis-
sioned officers of all seven uniformed 
services, highlighted the importance of 
the NOAA Corps for national defense. 
They stated that, ‘‘The unique sci-
entific and operational expertise, flexi-
bility, and deployment capability of 
the NOAA Corps continues to be a force 
multiplier for U.S. and ally air, land, 
and sea operation.’’ 
This first reauthorization of the 
NOAA 
Commissioned 
Officer 
Corps 
since 2002, under the House counterpart 
bill’s co-introducer of the dean of the 
House, Mr. YOUNG, further improves 
the diversity of the corps by author-
izing 
financial 
aid 
for 
a 
student 
precommissioning 
education 
in 
ex-
change 
for 
service, 
which 
will 
prioritize underserved populations to 
undertake careers in NOAA and ad-
dresses sexual harassment issues by 
strengthening the corps’ policies, in-
cluding required reporting of potential 
offenses. 
Mr. Speaker, we may shortly hear ob-
jections that, as noted, represent a dis-
tinct minority in Congress and the uni-
formed services community. They re-
cite three decades’–old arguments that 
we have long moved past. They recite 
various arguments that could just as 
easily be made for any other uniformed 
service. 
If we are going to go down that road, 
should we not make those arguments 
globally, 
not 
selectively 
and 
discriminatorily as to one of our seven 
services? 
They recite arguments that are sim-
ply inaccurate and, again, that seem to 
reflect a deep misunderstanding of 
NOAA’s mission. 
Here is the bottom line for this bill: 
NOAA does exist. It has existed for 50 
years. It has done its work with a com-
mitted officer corps for 50 years. It is 
not being abolished. That mission, that 
corps will continue. That mission is 
critical and its personnel must be rec-
ognized and improved. And NOAA offi-
cers are commissioned officers in our 
services and should be fully recognized 
as such, similar to all others. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan, bi-
cameral, needed, and fair bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), the dean of our 
Congress, so he can speak on this bill, 
and then I will correct the RECORD 
afterwards. 
(Mr. YOUNG asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding. I am going 
to miss Mr. BISHOP, his work, his being 
a gentleman and a good friend as the 
years have gone by. I have been 
through 3,452 Members of Congress, and 
he is one of the good ones. 
I thank Congressman CASE and Sen-
ator DAN SULLIVAN for this legislation. 
I know there is some opposition to it, 
but in Alaska, NOAA plays a very im-
portant role. They do navigation, all 
types of flood control. I can name all 
the things they do. They monitor fish 
stocks. 
They manage the tsunami warnings. 
We have some really good earthquakes 
in Alaska and some pretty good waves. 
They give us a warning system that 
makes it work, and it works very well. 
They work on the Sea Grant pro-
gram, provides highly qualified fellows 
who are very important. In fact, I 
think I have hired four in my career 
and they have worked in my office. 
They are outstanding young people. 
This is a piece of legislation that is 
bipartisan. It is badly needed. There 
will be some people who say we don’t 
need it. And I will give NOAA notice 
right now that sometimes they better 
wake up. They use an excuse of the flu 
for not monitoring our fish stocks. In 
that case, then, they should have gone 
out and gotten private people to do it 
for them, because we need that con-
stant flow of information to make sure 
we don’t overfish or underfish the 
stocks. 
So, NOAA, wake up a little bit. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I deeply ap-
preciate the support of my friend and 
colleague from Alaska, the dean of the 
House, on this bipartisan, bicameral 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO). 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
I rise today in support of S. 2981, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration 
Commissioned 
Officer 
Corps Amendments Act of 2020. This bi-
cameral 
and 
bipartisan 
legislation 
aims to improve the smallest uniform 
service in our country, the NOAA Com-
missioned Officer Corps. 
The men and women of the NOAA 
Corps operate a highly specialized fleet 
of scientific ships and aircraft, several 
of which are based in my district on 
the Mississippi Gulf Coast and along 
coastlines around the Nation. The re-
search conducted on these scientific 
platforms helps to improve hurricane 
forecasts, manage healthy and sustain-
able fisheries such as red snapper, and 
ensure safe and efficient maritime 
commerce on America’s waters. 
Members of the NOAA Corps are the 
ones who operate the 9 aircrafts and 15 
vessels in NOAA’s growing fleet. Dur-
ing a hurricane, they deploy on mis-
sions into the storm; and immediately 
after hurricanes, they deploy to assess 
damage and map out debris in the 
channels to open our ports back up as 
soon as possible. 
All these activities are essential to 
my district and many others, espe-
cially this year where we had back-to- 
back hurricanes in the Gulf impacting 
our maritime economy and ecosystems. 
NOAA Corps officers provide essen-
tial scientific and operational expertise 
needed for NOAA to meet its missions 
every day. Recognizing NOAA’s 50th 
anniversary and their growing respon-
sibilities, this legislation will help 
NOAA retain and recruit the most 
qualified officers and will offer these 
servicemembers the level of personal 
and professional support that they de-
serve. 
The 2020 hurricane season confirms 
that we need to make the right invest-
ments so the NOAA Corps can become 
even better at predicting storms, in 
turn, protecting life and property while 
helping conserve our fisheries that are 
vital to our national heritage. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe it is crucial 
that we reauthorize and support the 
NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
it. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I express my 
appreciation to new colleague, Mr. 
PALAZZO, for his support of this critical 
bill. 
Those of us that live in the oceans 
and on the coasts completely under-
stand the value of NOAA, again, as a 
matter of life and death in many cases, 
and we understand that NOAA can only 
do its job with a motivated, high-exper-
tise Corps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6121 
December 3, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
am assuming I have the traditional 15 
minutes remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Utah has 161⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD two documents. 
The first document is the dissenting 
views that Republicans filed on this 
bill in the committee. The second is 
the summary of problems that the De-
partment of Commerce Inspector Gen-
eral, the GAO and the NOAA itself 
have found with the corps, which in-
cluded a conclusion that the corps does 
not meet the criteria for military bene-
fits; converting officers to civilians 
would result in a net savings; that a 
NOAA Corps officer using a govern-
ment computer onboard a NOAA ship 
was accessing child pornography; pur-
poseful violations of the Clean Water 
Act by NOAA Corps-operated vessels; 
and a very damning observation that 
‘‘insufficient oversight and circumven-
tion of statutory requirements as insti-
tutionalized 
organizational 
behavior 
and culture’’ within this NOAA Corps. 
DISSENTING VIEWS H.R. 2406 
No doubt the members of the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration Corps 
of Commissioned Officers (NOAA Corps) are 
hardworking men and women who are honor-
ably serving our Nation, especially those 
who pilot into the turbulent hearts of hurri-
canes. However, there is no justification that 
this small, underutilized uniformed service 
should continue to exist, much less be great-
ly expanded with unprecedented benefits 
under this legislation. 
We are not the only ones who agree with 
this assessment. The House of Representa-
tives reported or passed (by voice vote) mul-
tiple bills that eliminated the NOAA Corps; 
the Administration itself attempted to shift 
the Corps into civilian status; and none 
other than Vice President Al Gore slated the 
NOAA Corps for elimination as part of his re-
inventing government initiative. In part be-
cause of the Corps’ higher expenses for its 
military- and veterans-type benefits, the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) has 
determined that the functions of the Corps 
could be accomplished less expensively using 
civil servants or private contractors. More 
seriously, GAO identified the Corps itself as 
a major impediment to more efficiently and 
effectively accomplishing its primary mis-
sions—to collect coastal and geodetic data, 
conduct fishery surveys and produce nautical 
charts—because of its continued insistence 
that it must use its own ships to accomplish 
these goals and its reluctance to schedule 
time on other, newer vessels like the Univer-
sity-National 
Oceanographic 
Laboratory 
System ships or the new $127M National 
Science Foundation regional class research 
vessel. Moreover, the Corps is greatly resist-
ant to creating private-sector jobs by uti-
lizing equally qualified contractors—like 
those hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, 
the Navy and the Environmental Protection 
Agency—to command and staff NOAA ships 
or conduct coastal surveys. In 1990, the De-
partment of Commerce Inspector General 
concluded that NOAA Corps members as-
signed to shore-based duties were 59% more 
costly than equivalent civilians. If H.R. 2406 
is enacted, that cost differential will be even 
higher. 
The Corps recognizes its life-line connec-
tion to the NOAA fleet of civilian ships, 
which has fallen from 21 to 16 since 2008, not-
ing that if NOAA does not invest in recapi-
talizing its fleet there will be ‘‘significant’’ 
personnel impacts. The most recent NOAA 
Fleet Plan (which conveniently omits any 
costs) notes that half of NOAA’s ships are 
due to be mothballed by 2028. While the Plan 
calls for the replacement of these ships, Con-
gress has not supported greatly expanding 
this expensive fleet, providing partial fund-
ing for preliminary designs for only a single 
vessel to date since 2016. Instead, Congress 
has worked around the Corps, supplying mil-
lions to NOAA line offices to conduct fish-
eries surveys through vessel leases while ad-
monishing NOAA for endangering the lives of 
those aboard the NOAA vessel Hi’ialakai 
which apparently suffered hull failure. In 
fact, because of their age, many of the NOAA 
vessels spend considerable time in dry dock 
(4 in the most recent NOAA Fleet update) or 
are otherwise home in port. Perhaps this ex-
plains why the most recent billet roster for 
the 321 NOAA Corps officers show only 94 as-
signed to ships (including dry-docked ships), 
while the vast majority are deskbound pro-
viding ‘‘mission support’’ or rotating short- 
term through civil service positions (like 
‘‘cetacean photo specialist’’) in NOAA pro-
gram offices. These latter positions could 
otherwise be filled by less expensive civilians 
with expertise in the subject matter area and 
with a longer-term commitment to the pro-
gram. 
These numbers illustrate why the average 
NOAA Corps officer is more likely to face a 
paper cut than an IED, which begs the ques-
tion why multiple military and veterans ben-
efits are extended to the Corps under H.R. 
2406. During the world wars some NOAA per-
sonnel were temporarily assigned to the 
armed services; this has not recurred, and 
according to GAO the Department of Defense 
has no plans to commandeer NOAA Corps of-
ficers. However, the modern Corps has used 
this potential assignment authority as a jus-
tification for access to military benefits, 
like burial at Arlington Cemetery or the G.I. 
bill. We hope that the House Armed Services 
and the Veterans Affairs Committees, which 
received referrals of this legislation, will 
take a hard look whether these benefits 
gratefully provided to those who have fought 
for our freedom should be extended to per-
sons who are not under the Code of Military 
Justice, whose appointments are not re-
viewed and approved by the Senate and who 
apparently aren’t even subject to a physical 
fitness requirement (see section 104 of the 
bill). Again, we recognize the special case of 
the NOAA Corps aviators, and would support 
their transfer to the Coast Guard or another 
armed service so that legislation like this 
would be unnecessary. 
Giving the sinking NOAA fleet, one of the 
most troubling aspects of H.R. 2406 is the 
55% increase in the size of the Corps and the 
removal of the legal constraints on the num-
ber of officers and certain flag officers. These 
numbers can be increased even further be-
cause the legislation allows the Corps to re-
hire retired officers or to designate officers 
serving in ‘‘positions of importance and re-
sponsibility’’ who don’t count against these 
caps. In addition, the Corps can have an un-
limited number of paid officer candidates to 
populate the Corps ranks. Under current law, 
the Corps is restricted to 321 officers and this 
number can be raised to 379 only if appro-
priate funding is available and, most impor-
tantly, the Secretary of Commerce has ‘‘jus-
tified organizational needs for the commis-
sion corps for each such fiscal year’’. Not 
only has the Corps failed to justify this mas-
sive increase, but this legislation strikes 
these requirements while inflating the Corps 
officers’ count to an all-time high of 500. The 
Corps already struggles with funding its 
handsome benefits and generous retirements, 
as witnessed by several budget bills to re-
vamp their retirement and benefit system 
(there are more retired Corps officers than 
those currently serving, and because Corps 
officers can retire with as little as 10 years of 
service, more will join these ranks). More-
over, serious allegations of sexual assault 
and harassment have also plagued the NOAA 
Corps, resulting in a recently enacted sexual 
harassment law specifically targeted to the 
Corps and Corps funding for sexual assault 
prevention. The NOAA Corps should get its 
house in order before recruiting three to six 
new platoons into its ranks. 
Apparently, even with these issues, the 
NOAA Corps has apparently had no problem 
filling its current recruitment quota if it 
needs such a large personnel increase. Under-
standably so—it is a great gig with almost 
all the benefits of a military career with few 
of the risks. Despite this and with no jus-
tification, H.R. 2406 creates lavish and expen-
sive new perks and extends even more exist-
ing armed forces benefits to current, future 
and retired Corps members: 
Paid three-year sabbatical with travel and 
transportation allowances and continued 
medical and dental care; 
The ability to opt out of promotion boards. 
The Corps is supposedly an up-or-out organi-
zation but based on a GAO decision analysis, 
it appears that an officer who failed to be 
promoted twice can be retained on staff until 
the officer can qualify for early retirement; 
Every single benefit provided to retired or 
separated armed services members, including 
employment 
preferences 
and 
assistance, 
medical and dental care, and commissary 
and exchange access; 
All benefits relating to armed services 
family programs, including free admission to 
national parks; 
An elaborate student loan repayment pro-
gram of up to $60K a year (currently the 
limit for military doctors and other armed 
forces health professionals) for as little as 
one year in service; 
A student pre-commissioning program for 
tuition, fees, education materials, monthly 
subsistence allowance, and a clothing allow-
ance, where repayment can be waived by the 
Corps if the student fails to be commissioned 
and where any obligation can be discharged 
in bankruptcy under certain circumstances. 
Payment for advanced degrees (tuition, 
room and board) as well as professional cre-
dentials for employment post-Corps; 
Eligibility for special payments (up to 
$60K), including personal money allowances; 
Mandatory hiring preferences in federal 
agencies; 
Certain senior officers allowed to retain 
their higher rank and pay while not serving 
in those positions if approaching retirement; 
and 
Repayment for failure to satisfy service re-
quirements for appointments, training and 
promotions is discretionary with the Corps, 
and any obligation can be discharged in 
bankruptcy under certain circumstances. 
Finally, we note that this legislation was 
not originated or transmitted to Congress by 
NOAA and was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget only after the 
markup of the bill. During the Obama Ad-
ministration, the Senate Commerce, Science 
and 
Transportation 
Committee 
con-
templated 
slightly 
less 
generous 
NOAA 
Corps bills in the past, albeit without any 
hearings. Perhaps it is just a coincidence 
that a senior NOAA Corps officer was re-
cently detailed to the Democrat Natural Re-
sources Committee staff who was previously 
assigned to the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee. Given the Committee Democrats’

focus on Trump Administration ethics, we 
hope that appropriate measures have been 
put in place to prevent conflicts of interest 
with this assignment. 
NOAA CORP ISSUES 
In a 1999 Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) letter to Chairman Ken Calvert, Sub-
committee on Energy and Environment, 
House Committee on Science, indicated that 
GAO has for years ‘‘urged NOAA to aggres-
sively 
pursue 
more 
cost-effective 
alter-
natives for acquiring needed marine data.’’ 
‘‘[NOAA] continues to rely heavily on its 
aging in-house fleet of ships—many of which 
are costly and inefficient to operate and 
maintain and lack the latest state-of-the-art 
technology . . .’’ and is ‘‘reluctant to give 
serious consideration to the many innova-
tive and more modern ways that private sec-
tor . . . could meet its basic marine data 
needs.’’ 
In a 1996 program evaluation, the Depart-
ment of Commerce Inspector General rec-
ommended that NOAA terminate its fleet 
modernization efforts, cease investing in its 
ships, and immediately begin to decommis-
sion, sell, or transfer them; and contract for 
the required ship services.’’ 
In a 1997 testimony from NOAA’s Director 
of Information Resources Management, the 
agency expressly stated that NOAA Corps 
does not meet criteria for receiving military 
compensation, converting officers to civil-
ians would result in annual net savings, and 
that entitlement to military rank was an 
outgrowth of temporary assignments during 
the second world war, but defense officials 
envision no role for them in the future. 
In 1998, the DOC IG included NOAA’s fleet 
as one of the top 10 most serious manage-
ment challenges facing the Department of 
Commerce. 
In 2017, GAO released a new report on 
NOAA Corp’s functions and again found that 
the Corp has not succeeded in expanding pri-
vate sector involvement in data collection— 
a recommendation made by GAO as early as 
their 1999 report and the IG’s 1996 rec-
ommendations. The report also found NOAA 
was significantly understating agency costs 
to conduct data collection functions com-
pared to the private sector. 
GAO’s reviews of NOAA’s cost comparison 
reports from ’06–’16 found that NOAA had not 
reported significant costs such as acquisition 
of a $24 million new vessel, nor did NOAA 
factor in major vessel maintenance into 
their operational cost estimates. Ultimately, 
NOAA Corp simply used costs to measure a 
single square nautical mile surveyed to com-
pare costs, ignoring those above and other 
significant operational costs. 
This review ultimately found that NOAA 
Corp did not develop a strategy for expand-
ing private sector, cost effective, data collec-
tion as required by law. 
NOAA Corp also did not include adminis-
trative costs in their comparisons because 
they ‘‘do not have the software to track con-
tract administration costs.’’ 
Ultimately, NOAA determined that car-
rying out actions in regard to the rec-
ommendations of this report would be dif-
ficult because it would ‘‘[require] the coordi-
nation of multiple offices within NOAA . . .’’ 
In 2015, a NOAA Corp officer was found to 
have had website traffic on a government 
computer aboard the NOAA ship Ron Brown, 
which was linked to a ‘‘notorious presence of 
child pornographic images and is frequented 
by pedophiles.’’ 
In 2014, DOC OIG found the improper dis-
charge of untreated water from a NOAA Corp 
vessel was an apparent practice—a violation 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. 
NOAA CORP ISSUES 
In 2008, a NOAA Corp employee was found 
to have used a government purchase credit 
card to purchase $18,000 in aftermarket parts 
to their motorcycle. 
In 2004, NOAA Corp was found to have con-
sistently failed to follow requirements for 
Senate confirmation of appointments and 
promotions since at least 1986. Furthermore, 
it was found that seventy-five percent of pro-
motions were made without first securing 
Senate confirmation. The report identified 
the causes for this problem: insufficient 
oversight and circumvention of statutory re-
quirements as institutionalized organiza-
tional behavior and culture. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. The NOAA 
Corps is a very small, underutilized but 
uniformed service group. It prevents 
questions with this type of group, with 
their history that they have, first of 
all: Why should they exist in the first 
place? But more significantly, why 
should they greatly expand and grant 
unprecedented benefits that this legis-
lation gives to this group? 
Congress, the administration, and 
even Vice President Al Gore all slated 
this NOAA Corps for elimination. In 
part, it was because the corps’ higher 
expenses because of their military-type 
benefits, even though they perform no 
military-type activities. 
The Government Accounting Office, 
GAO, determined that the functions of 
the corps could be less expensively 
given using civil servants or private 
collectors. More seriously, the GAO 
said that the corps itself is a major im-
pediment to more efficiently and effec-
tively accomplishing its missionary 
statement, which is to collect coastal 
data, to conduct fishing surveys, and to 
produce nautical charts. 
Now, why is this the case? 
Well, in one part because the corps 
insists that it must use their own 
ships, which are failing. They are re-
sistant to ever contracting with quali-
fied contractors like the Army Corps of 
Engineers does and the Navy does and 
even the EPA does. Even this bill rec-
ognizes that problem. If you go to look 
at section 501, it mandates that at 
least two private-sector charting and 
surveying contracts must be given. 
They recognize that what is happening 
right now is not effective, it is not effi-
cient, and it is a failure. 
The fleet for this corps has gone from 
21 down to 15 since 2008, and the GAO 
also noted that the NOAA fleet plan is 
to mothball half of their ships by 2028. 
Congress has only partially funded a 
single vessel since 2016, but the money 
that has been gone is still in the mil-
lions, and it goes to line officers, not 
for Naval vessels or for their leases. 
If one looks at the recent billet ros-
ter, you would find that the NOAA 
Corps has 94 of its 321 officers assigned 
to ships. Only 94. That includes the 
dry-docked ships. The vast majority of 
their officers are desk-bound, pro-
viding, as NOAA says, mission support 
like having a whale photographer. 
Now, giving the sinking number of 
the NOAA fleet, the increased cost of 
the NOAA officers, the most troubling 
aspect of this particular bill is a 55 per-
cent increase in the size of the corps; 
not in the amount of work to be done, 
but in the size of the corps. 
The corps now is restricted to 321 of-
ficers. It can be raised to 379 officers 
only if there is appropriate funding 
from Congress. Most importantly, the 
Secretary of Commerce will justify or-
ganizational needs for the commis-
sioned corps for that particular year. 
Not only has the corps failed to jus-
tify an increase—this massive increase, 
but this legislation strikes those rea-
sonable requirements of ever going for-
ward in the future. And it does conduct 
and create an all-time high of 500 billet 
spots in there whether it is needed or 
not. 
It is no surprise that there are those 
in the administration that do not sup-
port this personnel increase. 
The NOAA Corps’ roster illustrates 
why the average corps officer is far 
more likely to face a paper cut than 
any other kind of accident in their ca-
reers in this corps military function. 
Which means if that is the situation, if 
these are desk jobs in the first place, 
why are there multiple military and 
veteran benefits extended to the corps 
under this bill? 
During World War II, this corps was 
temporarily commandeered and put 
into the Navy service. Unfortunately, 
today, the Department of Defense has 
no plans whatsoever to commandeer 
any of the NOAA Corps or their offi-
cers. However, the corps still uses that 
history, that example during World 
War II when they were desperately 
needed and used to justify claiming 
military and veteran benefits that are 
normally given to our Armed Forces. 
I don’t think there is anyone here 
that has any doubt or would have any 
kind of grave problem giving benefits 
to those who fought for our freedom, 
but the corps is not that type of a 
group. They do not fall under the Code 
of Military Justice. Their appoint-
ments are not reviewed and approved 
by the Senate. They aren’t even sub-
ject to physical fitness requirements of 
the military. 
Moreover, and what is really prob-
lematic, is there have been serious al-
legations of sexual assault and harass-
ment that have plagued this NOAA 
Corps, resulting recently in the enact-
ment of a corps sexual harassment law 
and targeted funding for sexual assault 
prevention. 
Is this the kind of group, in all sin-
cerity, that deserves mandatory Fed-
eral hiring preferences? That would re-
quire student loan repayment at the 
same rate as you would any military, 
like a military doctor? Is that the 
same requirement that would have a 3- 
year paid sabbatical or free graduate 
school for post-employment work or 
even pocket money for their admirals?

All of you, if you were serious about 
this, should sign up for these. The ben-
efits are great, and all you have to do 
is photograph a couple of whales. 
This bill, finally, was not trans-
mitted to Congress by the administra-
tion. No, no. Perhaps it is coincidental

that there are two NOAA Corps officers 
who have been detailed to our Natural 
Resources Committee staff, one of 
whom was previously assigned to the 
Senate 
Commerce 
Committee 
staff 
where this bill originated. 
Given that concept, given that con-
nection, we need to have serious meas-
ures put into effect to maybe prevent 
these conflicts of interests in the fu-
ture that have created this NOAA 
Corps dream bill where they get all the 
benefits but don’t have the responsibil-
ities and they don’t do the same work. 
When I said we were dealing with 
kleinigkeiten today, this is the small-
est of all the kleinigkeiten. 
This is not a good bill. This is not 
something that we should forward on. 
We do need to look seriously at this 
corps in the future. 
And this is not something that is 
new. There are those who have been 
working on this issue and dealing with 
this corps for the last 30 years and still 
have not come up with the proper solu-
tion to it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly regret to 
hear the words from my friend, the 
ranking member’s mouth on this bill, 
because in scattershotting 9 or 10 cher-
ry-picked arguments, he ignores the 
big picture. 
He ignores, again, the big picture 
that the NOAA Corps are doing serious 
work for our country, are commis-
sioned officers, one of our seven com-
missioned officer corps, and are not 
recognized the same as the other six, to 
include the Public Health Service, 
which is a commissioned officer corps 
and is entitled to the same benefits as 
the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, 
and Coast Guard. 
I think, in all honesty—and I don’t 
think he means to do this—he does a 
great disservice to the people who are 
serving in the NOAA Corps by some of 
his statements, because these people 
are trying to do their best for our 
country. 
I am not sure that the Member has 
ever spent time on a NOAA ship in the 
high seas as I have, but if you do that, 
you know that there is nothing really 
to distinguish them from any of their 
fellow officers in any of the other serv-
ices. 
It would take a lot of time to go 
through each of my colleague’s 9 or 10 
cherry-picked arguments. I want to 
make a couple of quick comments and 
then some big picture observations. 
First of all, if I am not mistaken, the 
GAO report that he refers to is dated 
1996, a whole generation ago. That re-
port itself was disputed by subsequent 
studies and, I submit, is really no 
longer relevant. 
He says, twice: Why should we great-
ly expand the unprecedented benefits 
that the NOAA Corps receives? 
There is a very simple answer to 
that: Because they don’t get today 
what the other six do. All we are doing 
today in expanding is bringing them up 
to the same level as the other six 
corps. 
He says that the mission of NOAA is 
a minor mission, so why should we re-
ward them—I suppose is what he is say-
ing—with the same promotion benefits, 
the same educational benefits, the 
same retirement benefits, the same re-
spect as the other six. 
I would say to him, first of all, be-
cause that mission is worthy of that 
treatment. And, number one, if he is 
referring to the GAO report from a gen-
eration ago, the NOAA Corps does so 
much more today. 
I think we would all agree that the 
mission that the NOAA Corps works 
on, which is the basic health and qual-
ity of our oceans, of our atmosphere, of 
our ability to predict the weather, of 
our ability to protect our shorelines, of 
our ability to protect and sustain our 
fisheries, is so much greater than it 
ever was. 
He complains that some of the mem-
bers of the NOAA Corps spend time on-
shore. Is that any different from the 
Navy? I don’t think the Navy has all of 
its officers out at sea all the time, and 
neither does the NOAA Corps. The 
Army doesn’t have all of its officers 
overseas in battle zones. 
He says a number of times: This is a 
55 percent increase in the size of the 
corps. 
Yes, it does authorize an increase in 
the size of the NOAA Corps from 320 to 
a maximum of 500—by the way, the last 
authorization, as already noted, was al-
most 20 years ago—but that increase is 
subject to two conditions: First of all, 
it can only be increased on the certifi-
cation of need by the Secretary of 
Commerce; and it is subject to congres-
sional oversight, both general over-
sight authority and, most importantly, 
funding. 
So there are lots of steps between 320 
and 500, but this gives them the author-
ity to move if it is needed. Frankly, I 
believe that we should move it up, but 
that is up to us to decide with the Sec-
retary of Commerce and with the Con-
gress. 
He says: Well, we are not building 
any new NOAA ships. 
Well, I think we should build a lot 
more new NOAA ships. I believe that 
NOAA’s mission is going to be—I think 
that when we look back on today 25 
years from now at the size of this effort 
for our Federal Government, we are 
going to say to ourselves: That was so 
insufficient given the challenge that 
we faced. 
There is a dire need for additional 
NOAA-related research, NOAA-related 
activities across this country, across 
this world. So the fact that we have 
not authorized and built a sufficient 
number of new NOAA ships for its mis-
sion is no reason to treat the NOAA Of-
ficer Corps differently from the other 
six services. 
My colleague rightly raises the issues 
NOAA has had of sexual assault within 
its ranks, as have other uniformed 
services, and, as he points out as well, 
this Congress responded with an act 
specific to the NOAA situation. This 
bill goes further and strengthens that 
act. So we are responding to the con-
cern in Congress, as has NOAA itself. 
Finally, he seems to have some con-
tinuing issues with a staff member 
from NOAA assigned to the committee. 
It is not unusual, of course, for depart-
ments in the administration to second 
members for some work. We have had 
fellows do it all the time. But if that is 
an issue we have to look at, that is an 
issue we have to look at, but that is 
not an issue that should stand in the 
way of a constructive and fair adjust-
ment of the benefits and position af-
forded to NOAA officers. 
I would conclude by going back to 
the fact that, if the gentleman’s con-
cerns are so widespread, if his concerns 
are so deep, then why do we have the 
principal military uniformed services 
associations of our country supporting 
this bill without qualification? 
I refer to the Military Officers Asso-
ciation of America. I also refer to The 
Military Coalition, 5.5 million mem-
bers, consisting of—and I am not going 
to read all their names because I think 
it is about 30 here. I will just read 
maybe the first 10 or so—the Air Force 
Association, the Air Force Sergeants 
Association, the Army Aviation Asso-
ciation of America, the Association of 
Military Surgeons, the Association of 
the United States Navy, the Blinded 
Veterans Association, the Coast Guard, 
the Public Health Service, the Fleet 
Reserve Association, the Gold Star 
Wives of America, the Iraq Afghanistan 
Veterans Association. 
It is very clear that military officers 
and their community view their NOAA 
colleagues and the corps as being treat-
ed substantially unfairly in the big pic-
ture and want them to be afforded, 
again, the same benefits, the same re-
spect that is due the other six services. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, we have a 
situation where the Senate passed this 
bill, a Republican Senator’s bill, by 
unanimous consent. That is why this 
House should pass this bill, as well, and 
send it to the President. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again I appreciate 
the comments that are made in defense 
of this organization, but as I said be-
fore, this is a 30-year-old problem. 
Unfortunately, NOAA Corps is not 
part of the military. They don’t do 
military-type functions. The National 
Health Services, the other uniformed 
corps, they don’t get these same kind 
of benefit. 
The gentleman is right; there is a 
provision, and there has been, on the 
ability of expanding this corps if there 
were appropriations for it and if the 
Secretary of Commerce would justify 
it. The problem is this bill removes

that. So it will now be up to the corps 
to decide what their size is and what 
their justification is. 
It is the wrong thing to do. This is 
the wrong approach. This is not the 
right way of doing it. And I am sorry, 
the studies have shown that repeatedly 
over and over and over again. 
If, indeed, there are some people who 
want to do this, it is wrong. It is sim-
ply wrong. This is not a military. To 
insist that they get military benefits is 
an abuse of the system. It doesn’t hap-
pen anywhere else. It is only with this. 
So I am sorry. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I don’t have 
to play this game of reserving. I would 
be happy to, but I think we are the 
only ones left on this topic on the 
floor. No one else actually cares. 
So, if the gentleman is ready, I will 
yield back, urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
particular bill because it is the wrong 
thing to do and it is not—not—justi-
fied. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
the ranking member, for his passion on 
this matter. 
I think he is wrong, and I think the 
entire Senate thinks he is wrong, and I 
think the majority of this House 
thinks he is wrong. He is, of course, en-
titled to his opinion, but I think that 
the statement that this bill is wrong is 
not borne out by the facts; it is not 
borne out by the sentiment, again, of 
the broader community. 
If there is a problem with NOAA or 
any other commissioned officer corps, 
the way to solve that problem is not to 
kill the corps itself. The way to solve 
that problem is not to deprive it of the 
resources that it needs to fix its prob-
lem and to continue its mission. 
For me to accept the ranking mem-
ber’s argument would be for me to ac-
cept that, in fact, NOAA itself is not 
relevant, and I don’t believe that. I be-
lieve NOAA is entirely relevant, and it 
needs to be staffed by people who are 
incentivized to be recruited, who are 
incentivized to stay and to want to do 
their job, and who are recognized as 
such. 
This is not about the military, per se. 
I would disagree with his characteriza-
tion that the NOAA Corps does not per-
form a military function. It is cer-
tainly quasi-military in many ways, 
but that is not what this is about. This 
is about fairly recognizing one of our 
seven commissioned officer corps orga-
nizations in our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 2981. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

ant to section 3 of House Resolution

ther proceedings on this motion will be

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will con-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3682, sponsored by our friend 
and colleague, Representative LUJA´ N of 
New Mexico. 
This bill would support land grant 
communities and acequias across New 
Mexico and Texas by providing guid-
ance on certain allowable land uses. 
Since the end of the Spanish-Amer-
ican War and the signing of the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, these commu-
nities have faced challenges accessing 
basic resources like fuel wood and graz-
ing land and clarity on their infra-
structure maintenance obligations. 
These challenges continue to the 
present day, and this bill would help 
provide some certainty and clarity in 
order to better support these commu-
nities and hopefully improve relations 
with Federal land managers. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
LUJA´ N for his tireless service and sup-
port on behalf of land grant commu-
nities and acequia owners, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to vote in support 
of H.R. 3682. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1900 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate this opportunity. This 
bill has got one thing that I think is 
going for it very heavily in that it au-
thorizes the opportunity of having the 
Federal Government being forced to 
actually deal with the local commu-
nity on management practices. That is 
something we have been trying to get 
in all land management policies in the 
United States. This does that, that is 
why we support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N). 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, as a 
proud New Mexican, I rise in support of 
the Land Grant-Mercedes Traditional 
Use Recognition and Consultation Act 
that I introduced to ensure that the 
Federal Government recognizes the 
historical and cultural significance of 
New Mexico’s land grants and acequias. 
Growing up on a small farm in 
Nambe, New Mexico, I would wake up 
before dawn to feed the livestock, to 
open 
the 
‘‘compuertas’’ 
or 
the 
headgates to allow the waters of the 
acequia to flow to our land and irrigate 
our crops. These chores and respon-
sibilities, preserving our acequias and 
communal lands, are part of our way of 
life in New Mexico. 
Land grants and acequias have been 
around for generations, hundreds of

years, and they deserve recognition 
from the Federal Government. Tradi-
tional communities face a growing 
number of challenges, such as the cli-
mate crisis, which impacts the local 
watersheds and forested areas. Without 
improved consultation and cooperation 
between the Federal Government and 
traditional communities, these com-
munities may not have access to the 
resources they need to survive. 
This legislation offers land grants 
the opportunity to be more involved in 
the issues that impact their commu-
nity by requiring that future Federal 
land management planning consider 
historical and traditional uses. 
It directs the Federal Government to 
issue guidance on permit requirements 
for qualified traditional use commu-
nities and helps New Mexicans who 
have stewarded these lands for genera-
tions maintain precious infrastructure 
like acequias. 
This legislation recognizes the im-
portance of protecting culturally im-
portant sites and communities and en-
sures that the impact of Federal ac-
tions on historical-traditional uses is 
evaluated and considered during the 
land management planning processes. 
To ensure that acequia associations 
have a strong voice in advocating for 
their right to maintain their infra-
structure, this legislation requires the 
Forest Service to work directly with 
acequia associations to develop a pro-
posed rule on special use permits. 
Addressing these challenges faced by 
land grant and acequia communities, 
including their interactions with the 
Federal Government, has been a pri-
ority of mine since I was elected to 
Congress. 
I am proud and honored to have 
worked with the New Mexico Land 
Grant Council and the New Mexico 
Acequia Association to move this legis-
lation forward. 
I am grateful to Chairman GRIJALVA, 
Ranking 
Member 
BISHOP, 
Sub-
committee Chair HAALAND, and Rank-
ing Member YOUNG, and Representative 
CASE for their support in bringing this 
important legislation to the House 
floor. 
Today, with the support of New Mexi-
co’s traditional communities, I urge 
the House to pass my legislation and 
ensure a victory for our land grants 
and acequias. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). Without objection, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE) will control the balance of 
the time. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the ranking member, I would 
just like to say that we support this 
legislation. We certainly appreciate 
our friend, Mr. LUJA´ N, for bringing it 
forward. 
Just a few comments I would like to 
make, rising in support of H.R. 3682. 
This bill seeks to ensure better con-
sultation and collaboration between 
our Federal land management agencies 
and local stakeholders over manage-
ment of New Mexico’s land grants and 
acequias. 
H.R. 3682 requires coordination be-
tween the Department of Agriculture, 
the Department of the Interior, and 
land grant-mercedes. These are the 
governing bodies of certain community 
land grants made by Spain or Mexico 
in the 17th to the mid-19th centuries to 
individuals, groups, and communities 
to promote the settlement of the 
southwestern United States. 
Specifically, this bill directs Federal 
land management agencies to make 
these bodies aware of changes to man-
agement plans and other Federal ac-
tions affecting their land grants. H.R. 
3682 also requires the Federal Govern-
ment to issue guidance on permitting 
and permissible uses. 
Finally, this bill creates a process for 
New Mexico’s land grant-mercedes to 
establish their historical boundaries 
and provides a pathway for acquiring 
Federal land that falls within those 
boundaries when the Federal Govern-
ment disposes of it. 
We should always strive to make sure 
that the Federal Government is a good 
neighbor to the communities most im-
pacted by its land management deci-
sions, and this good bill does exactly 
that. It empowers rural communities 
in New Mexico with a greater say over 
land management decisions impacting 
their historically important common 
lands which will, in turn, ensure con-
tinued community care and use for 
generations to come. 
So I support this legislation. I thank 
the gentleman very much for bringing 
it forward, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I am 
very happy to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
HAALAND), chair of the subcommittee 
of jurisdiction, National Parks, For-
ests, and Public Lands, my friend and 
colleague. 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3682, the 
Land Grant-Mercedes Traditional Use 
Recognition and Consultation Act. 
I would like to begin by congratu-
lating the author of the bill, my good 
friend and colleague, Representative 
BEN RAY LUJA´ N, and thank him for 
having me as an original cosponsor. 
His hard work and dedication to mov-
ing this bill forward are what got it to 
the House floor today. And the testi-
mony from Representative LUJA´ N from 
beside an acequia during our virtual 
hearing on the bill helped our col-
leagues to understand how important 
this legislation is to our constituents. 
We will absolutely miss Representa-
tive LUJA´ N when he begins service on 
the other side of the Capitol in the 
Senate, but we look forward to con-
tinuing to work with him on these and 
other issues that are important for 
New Mexico and our country. 
In our home State of New Mexico, 
land grants and acequias have long 
played a critical role in our traditional 
way 
of 
life, 
practicing 
traditional 
methods of stewardship over our land 
and water. 
But for more than a century, these 
communities have fought for recogni-
tion, consultation, and access to their 
historic communal lands, which are 
necessary to sustain their land-based 
heritage and agricultural economies. 
At the hearing I chaired on this bill, 
we heard from Arturo Archuleta of the 
New Mexico Land Grant Council about 
the unique connection between tradi-
tional communities and the lands they 
manage, and the challenges they face 
because some of the lands that for-
merly belonged to them are now Fed-
eral lands. 
He noted that as the climate change 
continues to impact watersheds and 
forested uplands, the protection of tra-
ditional uses must be included in the 
conversations about the management 
of public lands for land grant commu-
nities to survive. 
These are the same messages I have 
heard when I have visited land grant 
communities in my district. 
The bill we consider today will pro-
vide enhanced access and consultation 
between 
Federal 
land 
management 
agencies and land grants and acequias, 
which is an essential part for maintain-
ing their way of life, and I am proud to 
support it. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I cer-
tainly endorse and agree with my col-
league’s comments on Mr. LUJA´ N’s 
service in the House. The House’s loss 
is the Senate’s gain. 
And I would also note that I person-
ally enjoyed Mr. LUJA´ N’s personal tes-
timony from an acequia before the 
committee. That is the way to do it, 
where you have a real sense of what 
the actions are that you are taking. 
I urge passage of this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 3682, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to provide for great-
er consultation between the Federal 
Government and the governing bodies 
and community users of land grant- 
mercedes in New Mexico, to provide for 
a process for recognition of the his-
toric-traditional uses of land grant- 
mercedes, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4153 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Health Care 
Access for Urban Native Veterans Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH FED-
ERAL AGENCIES. 
Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Act (25 U.S.C. 1645) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ‘‘urban 
Indian organizations,’’ before ‘‘and tribal or-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
H.R. 
4153, 
the 
Health Care Access for Urban Native 
Veterans Act, will ensure that Native 
American veterans have equal access 
to healthcare, regardless of their loca-
tion of residence, by expanding Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, VA, funding 
to include urban Indian health centers. 
The Indian Health Service acts as the 
primary Federal agency responsible for 
providing healthcare to federally rec-
ognized Indian and Alaska Native com-
munities. Currently, there are three 
types of facilities that make up the 
IHS system: Federally-operated facili-
ties, tribally-operated facilities, and 
urban 
Indian 
organization-operated, 
UIO, facilities. 
As opposed to the federally-operated 
and tribally-operated facilities, which 
are often located in remote areas, UIO 
facilities have been established in larg-
er cities in order to accommodate the 
large populations of tribal members lo-
cated in urban areas. 
By law, a Native veteran is eligible 
to receive services under both the VA 
and IHS and can choose which one to 
use at any given time. Section 405 of 
the Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act, or IHCIA, authorizes the VA to re-
imburse federally-operated and trib-
ally-operated IHS facilities for any 
services that they provide to eligible 
Native veterans. 
To that end, the VA has entered into 
one national reimbursement agreement 
that encompasses 74 federally-operated 
IHS facilities, as well as 114 individual 
reimbursement agreements with trib-
ally-operated IHS sites. 
However, because Section 405 does 
not explicitly reference UIOs, these fa-
cilities are excluded from receiving any 
reimbursements from the VA. This has 
severely hampered the ability of urban 
Indian health organizations to properly 
care for the Native veterans living in 
urban centers and has forced these vet-
erans to travel great distances to reach 
an IHS facility or, sadly, to abstain 
from treatment altogether. 
We can all agree that Native veterans 
should have equal access to healthcare, 
regardless of where they choose to re-
side. As such, H.R. 4153 will bring par-
ity to the IHS system by allowing UIOs 
to enter into reimbursement agree-
ments with the VA. 
I want to thank the sponsor of the 
bill, Representative RO KHANNA from 
California, for advocating on behalf of 
Native veterans everywhere, and I urge 
quick adoption of this bipartisan legis-
lation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
This is a good bill, and we obviously 
have no problems with this particular 
bill. 
When I started, I talked about 
kleinigkeiten on the small stuff. As 
good as this is, it is still small stuff 
and, actually, it is taken out—it is a 
portion of S. 886, which deals with In-
dian water rights settlements and ex-
tensions. That entire bill, if you really 
want to help out Native American pop-
ulations, if you really want to solve 
some of these problems for them, espe-
cially during this time, with the pan-
demic going on and hitting those areas 
even harder than some of the others, 
that entire Senate bill should be taken 
up and passed. 
Now, the fact that you have taken a 
small portion of that out and put it 
here as a separate bill still makes this 
a decent bill and I am supportive of it. 
But if we really cared, and we were 
really important with what we did, 
take the entire Udall bill, bring it over 
here and pass the damn thing so that 
we can get it signed and get it enacted 
into law. That is really what would 
help people and that wouldn’t be 
kleinigkeiten. That is a big deal. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this measure, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and

(H.R. 7045) to require the Secretary of 
Agriculture to conduct a study on 
lands that could be included in a Na-
tional Forest in Hawai’i, and for other

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7045 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 7045. This legisla-
tion would require the Secretary of Ag-
riculture, in coordination with the Ha-
waii Department of Land and Natural 
Resources, to conduct a study to iden-
tify lands in the State of Hawaii that 
merit inclusion in the National Forest 
System. 
Hawaii is the most isolated island 
chain and one of the most ecologically 
diverse places in the world. Within 
these constrained borders, we have 10 
of the 13 world climate zones and eco-
systems, ranging from the deserts to 
the tropics, where plants and animals 
that found their way to Hawaii evolved 
like nowhere else. The study would 
consider how a Hawaii national forest, 
which we do not currently have, could 
contribute to the conservation of this 
biodiversity not found elsewhere in the 
National Forest System while sup-
porting the research mission of the In-
stitute of Pacific Islands Forestry. 
My bill provides the first step in es-
tablishing a national forest in Hawaii. 
It would help inventory where Hawaii’s 
native koa, ohia, and sandalwood for-
ests can be conserved and expanded for 
cultural and commercial practices. It 
would help identify where cultural 
sites could be better conserved and ac-
cess expanded to the public and practi-
tioners. It would help provide the basis 
to bring together local stakeholders to 
move forward the conversation of how 
to responsibly establish a national for-
est in Hawaii in a manner that will 
benefit both Hawaii’s island commu-
nities and the National Forest Service. 
As we continue to identify solutions 
to our climate and biodiversity crises, 
I hope we can all see the value in tak-
ing this step toward protecting Ha-
waii’s unique forest resources and our 
native species. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. CASE. I yield to the gentleman 
from Utah. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Is the gen-
tleman sure he really wants the Fed-
eral Government having a forest in his 
place? 
Mr. CASE. Yes. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Twenty years 
from now, come back here, and we will 
tell the gentleman we told him so. 
Madam Speaker, I have no objections 
to the bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I accept 
the offer of Mr. Ranking Member. I will 
look the gentleman up in 20 years. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

(e) FUNDING.—For each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2024, there is authorized to be appro-
priated to the Secretary $40,000,000 to carry 
out this section. 
(f) DERIVATION OF FUNDS.—Funds to carry 
out the activities under this section shall be 
derived from amounts authorized to be ap-
propriated to the Secretary that are enacted 
after the date of the enactment of this sec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will con-
trol 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Hawaii. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the National Land-
slide Preparedness Act sponsored by 
my colleague, Ms. DELBENE, would es-
tablish a national landslide hazards re-
duction program through the United 
States Geological Survey to better 
identify landslide risks and to improve 
emergency preparedness for commu-
nities. This bill also directs USGS to 
implement a 3D elevation program to 
update and produce high-resolution 
elevation data across the country. 
The House passed a version of this 
legislation by voice vote last year, but 
after further negotiation with both the 
majority and the minority in the Sen-
ate, we have agreed to a few changes in 
the language and are passing this re-
vised bill to allow the Senate to move 
this compromise to the President be-
fore it adjourns. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, once again, I have 
no objection to this particular bill. I do 
have objections to the process we are 
going through. 
The House has already passed a bill. 
It went to the Senate. The Senate 
passed a bill. It came back here. Now, 
we introduced a new bill to go up there 
with different changes in it going back 
to the Senate. We should have fixed it 
the first time. But having said that, go 
with it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE). 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, al-
most 7 years ago, on March 22, 2014, 
Washington experienced one of its 
worst natural disasters ever. In a mat-
ter of seconds, a tragic landslide near 
Oso killed 43 people, destroyed over 40 
homes, and severely damaged public in-
frastructure and private property. 
That day forever changed the people 
of Oso, Darrington, Arlington, the 
Stillaguamish Tribe, and the Sauk- 
Suiattle Tribe. But even in the after-
math of the landslide, it was incredibly 
inspiring to see a community come to-
gether to help each other through this 
tragedy. That is why I introduced this 
bill, the National Landslide Prepared-
ness Act. 
In 2016, I introduced the first version 
of this bill and have been working tire-
lessly to get it signed into law. This 
will allow significant progress to be 
made in landslide science and will 
allow communities to be better pre-
pared for when landslides do occur. 
As the Oso landslide demonstrated, 
simply sending aid after a tragic nat-
ural disaster is insufficient. We need to 
do more to fund programs and research 
efforts to prevent future natural disas-
ters from becoming national tragedies. 
In recent years, we have seen dra-
matic increases in extreme weather 
events, and we need to do everything in 
our power to make sure that commu-
nities across the country are better 
prepared. Given the importance of this 
issue, I strongly urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. Getting it signed into 
law is long overdue, and I hope the 
Senate will pass this bill quickly and 
send it to the President’s desk for his 
signature. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this measure, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 8810, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
BIG CAT PUBLIC SAFETY ACT 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1380) to amend the Lacey Act

the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) and the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will con-
trol 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Hawaii. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1380, the Big Cat 
Public Safety Act. 
At the beginning of this hectic year, 
many Americans were introduced to 
the issue before us today and this legis-
lation for the first time through the 
‘‘Tiger King,’’ which in addition to a 
plethora of colorful real-life characters 
also shined a spotlight on the dark side 
of keeping lions, tigers, and other big 
cats in captivity. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act ends 
the ownership of big cats as pets and 
prohibits exhibitors from allowing pub-
lic contact with big cats, including 
cubs. 
In 2003, Congress unanimously passed 
the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, which 
amended the Lacey Act to prohibit the 
import, export, buying, selling, trans-
port, receiving, or acquisition of big 
cats across States to the U.S. border. 
However, the existing law did not in-
clude prohibitions for the private pos-
session or breeding of big cats. 
Currently, State laws vary quite a 
bit. Some States have no restrictions; 
some simply require registration; and 
some completely prohibit ownership of 
big cats as pets. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act builds 
on the Captive Wildlife Safety Act by 
making it illegal to privately possess 
or breed lions, tigers, leopards, chee-
tahs, jaguars, cougars, or any hybrid. 
The bill is narrowly focused on pri-
vately owned animals and includes ex-
emptions for exhibitors with U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture class C li-
censes, such as zoos, State universities, 
and sanctuaries. 
This bill, championed by my col-
league, Representative MIKE QUIGLEY, 
along with an astounding 230 cospon-
sors, is a commonsense solution to ad-
dress public safety and animal abuse 
concerns. It enjoys wide bipartisan sup-
port, and it is time we passed it into 
law. 
It is unknown how many big cats, in-
cluding tigers, lions, jaguars, leopards, 
cougars, and hybrids, are currently 
kept in private ownership in the United 
States, but estimates are in the range 
of 5,000 to 10,000. That means an aver-
age of up to 200 big cats are in private 
ownership in every State in America. 
I don’t know about you, Madam 
Speaker, but I wouldn’t feel safe with 
my children or grandchildren living 
next door to a tiger, nor does that seem 
humane for the animals whose ances-
tors roamed vast expanses of the sa-
vannahs and jungles. 
As we saw in ‘‘Tiger King,’’ the top 
priority for private big cat owners is 
not the best interests of animals or 
public safety but rather greed, profit, 
or glory. 
Since 1990, there have been around 
300 dangerous incidents involving big 
cats in the United States—including 
one just today—that have resulted in 
human injuries, mauling, and even 
death. When these incidents occur, 
first responders are also put at risk 
since they are not trained or equipped 
to handle situations involving big cats. 
Madam Speaker, I hope you can all 
agree with me that the private owner-
ship of big cats opens the door for 
rampant animal abuse and also pre-
sents a dangerous and significant risk 
to public safety. 
This bill is endorsed by over 27 orga-
nizations, including the Association of 
Zoos and Aquariums and the National 
Sheriffs’ Association. Of special note as 
well is that the Zoological Association 
of America, which previously opposed 
this measure, has withdrawn its oppo-
sition and is now neutral because its 
board has now banned public contact 
with big cats at its accredited zoos. 
Please join me in voting for this leg-
islation to stop animal abuse and bad 
actors like those we saw in ‘‘Tiger 
King.’’ In the midst of a roller coaster 
of a year, here is one thing we can do 
to reduce the mayhem. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1380, the 
Big Cat Public Safety Act, and I am 
grateful for the bipartisan support it 
has received. I also want to thank my 
staffer, Max, who worked so hard on 
this measure. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act has 
been endorsed by the Fraternal Order 
of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, and numerous other State and 
local law enforcement agencies because 
500-pound carnivores pose a serious and 
very real threat to first responders, law 
enforcement officers, and entire com-
munities around the country. The 
photo behind me is not staged.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6133 
December 3, 2020 
This bill is also endorsed by the Hu-
mane Society of the United States and 
countless other animal welfare organi-
zations because lions and tigers do not 
belong in urban apartments or in cages 
in suburban backyards and because pri-
vate citizens simply do not have the re-
sources to care for dangerous animals 
that are meant to roam over hundreds 
of square miles. 
As was stated, this bill is supported 
by the AGA and is not opposed by the 
Zoological Association of America, the 
trade association for small roadside- 
type zoos, because ripping newborn 
cubs from their mothers moments after 
their birth to use them as props in 
photos is already cruel enough, but 
once they are too big to be safely held, 
brutally killing them is just wrong. 
b 1930 
Nearly 65,000 Americans have signed 
a Change.org petition calling for the 
immediate passage of this bill because 
the Netflix series ‘‘Tiger King’’ showed 
the 
world 
in 
stark 
relief 
how 
exploitive, dangerous, and inhumane 
this tiny so-called industry is. 
This bill should be served by every 
American because right now taxpayers 
shoulder the cost of monitoring and 
regulating private owners, and when 
big cats are rescued from horrific con-
ditions or simply abandoned by over-
whelmed owners, they pay for the care 
and feeding of these cats. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the many 
Republican Members of Congress who 
support this bill, which is cosponsored 
by more than half the House. 
I urge every Member to stand with 
the law enforcement community and 
stand up for those that need our help 
but cannot ask for that. Please vote for 
this bill. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
for too long, big cats have been mis-
treated, exploited, and abused in pri-
vate roadside zoos. Private possession 
of big cats is a tremendous risk to hu-
mans as well. On average, a 1-year-old 
tiger weighs about 200 pounds and can 
easily harm or kill a human. 
These wild animals are trained to 
perform for paying customers, and at 
the end of the day, they are wild, dan-
gerous animals that are a serious risk 
to humans and themselves. 
Big cats, themselves, are also at risk, 
as there have been countless reports of 
abuse, mistreatment, and exploitation 
at private zoos. 
Madam Speaker, opponents of our 
legislation argue that it unfairly tar-
gets small zoos, pitting the large 
against the small. To be clear, this leg-
islation has nothing to do with the zoo 
size and does not ban any zoo from pos-
sessing, breeding, or exhibiting big 
cats. Our legislation prohibits zoos 
from allowing the public to interact 
with big cats. 
It does not in any way impact the 
typical model of zoos in which they 
have an exhibit of big cats on display. 
As long as the zoo does not allow direct 
contact between people and the public 
and these big cats, they will not be af-
fected by this legislation. 
This practice also takes a toll on law 
enforcement agencies that are forced 
to respond to escapes and attacks when 
big cats have outgrown cub petting and 
are funneled into the hands of private 
citizens. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is sup-
ported by both the National Sheriffs’ 
Association and the Fraternal Order of 
Police. 
I thank the Humane Society, Animal 
Wellness Action, and the Animal Wel-
fare Institute for their incredible advo-
cacy on this issue, and to my prede-
cessor who worked on this bill, Con-
gressman Jeff Denham from the State 
of California, for all of his work. And, 
of course, I thank my partner on this 
legislation, 
Congressman 
MIKE 
QUIGLEY. 
As a member of the bipartisan Con-
gressional Animal Caucus, we are com-
mitted to ensuring that our govern-
ment is doing its part to promote ani-
mal welfare, and it is crucial that we 
stand up for animals, both as individ-
uals and societies. 
Madam Speaker, as was pointed out, 
there are 230 cosponsors on this bill 
that collectively represent over 165 
million Americans who support this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1380, the 
Big Cat Public Safety Act. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to my colleague from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak on this. 
Madam Speaker, I am excited that 
this bill is finally making it to the 
floor. We have watched the support 
build while we have watched the case 
become ever stronger. 
As has been referenced by my col-
leagues, across the country, there are 
thousands of big cats—‘‘exotics’’ they 
are referred to—in terms of tigers and 
lions who are often kept by private 
owners in unsafe and abusive condi-
tions. They are shown often bred by un-
licensed exhibitors in basements or 
backyards. Not only does this cause 
suffering among these exhibit wild ani-
mals that are not meant to live under 
these conditions, but it does, as has 
been referenced, pose a risk to commu-
nity safety. 
Since 1990, there have been almost 
380 dangerous incidents involving cap-
tive big cats in 46 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, leading to some 
traumatic injuries—and even death. 
Too often, as has been referenced, it 
is the first responders who answer calls 
involving these animals, exposing po-
lice and fire to unnecessary risk. They 
are trained for public safety, not to 
deal with these huge and occasionally 
dangerous animals. State law is com-
pletely inadequate. It is a patchwork 
on this issue. Some ban private use. 
Others allow it with no questions 
asked. This is cruel and dangerous. 
Today, we are voting on a bill to 
change that. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
friends, 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK, 
Mr. 
QUIGLEY—people who have spent time 
advancing this issue, and finally, it is 
before us. It will restrict private own-
ership of big cats, reduce breeding, and 
help minimize abuse. 
As has been referenced and needs to 
be emphasized, this is narrowly focused 
on privately owned animals with ap-
propriate exemptions for zoos and uni-
versities and sanctuaries. It can im-
prove the lives of big cats and protect 
communities when things go wrong. 
These cats were never meant to be in 
captivity. Unlicensed ownership and 
breeding is bad for the animals. It is 
bad for the community. It doesn’t ad-
vance conservation or education. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that we will 
both vote today overwhelmingly to end 
the exotic trade on big cats and focus 
our efforts on real, meaningful con-
servation efforts at home and abroad. I 
think we were all just horrified by 
what we saw with the television series, 
‘‘Tiger King.’’ Sadly, one would think 
that that would be enough to motivate 
the action. 
Having worked on this issue over the 
years, I had some opportunity to be fa-
miliar with some of the players. This is 
something that I hope now is finally 
going to end, and it can today with our 
vote. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with 
apologies, 
lions and tigers and bears, oh my. I 
have to say that before somebody else 
does it. But we also have to realize, as 
we are going through the kleinigkeiten 
of this day’s efforts, that this is one of 
those kleinigkeiten coming again here. 
We should also realize that Oz was not 
reality, it was a movie, and that re-
ality TV is not that of which should be 
the basis of public policy. 
This bill, contrary to what I have 
been hearing so far, is not about pro-
tecting the public from big cats. It is 
about hurting small, family-run zoos 
across the country. It is a power play 
of some kind, which is one of the rea-
sons why the Zoological Association of 
America expressed their grave con-
cerns with this bill in a very pointed 
letter addressed to the committee 
chairman, that this represents an un-
warranted Federal intrusion into the 
rights and responsibilities of wildlife 
exhibitors and will have significant 
negative impacts on federally licensed 
zoological facilities. 
Madam Speaker, the issue is that, 
under current law, anyone who has one 
of these exhibitions must obtain a class 
E exhibitor license, and that is given 
by the United States Department of 
Agriculture under the Animal Welfare 
Act. So a licensee under the Animal 
Welfare Act has to abide by all the

rules that govern housing and keeping 
and care of the animals and are subject 
to unannounced inspections under the 
direction of the Department of Agri-
culture. And it is doing its job. It is 
doing its job effectively and efficiently. 
Madam Speaker, this bill ignores all 
of that under the guise of animal wel-
fare, denying responsible Federal li-
cense facilities and predicating these 
class E exemptions on animal rights 
ideology, not necessarily the policy of 
what has been taken during the past. 
What happens now is that this par-
ticular bill has, special interest groups 
having drafted it, now amends the 
Lacey Act—not the Animal Welfare 
Act, but the Lacey Act—and now has 
the Department of the Interior being 
the ones who are responsible for what 
is going on here. 
So what is illegal now under the 
Lacey Act changes would be legal 
under the Animal Welfare Act, which is 
still going to be on the books. If noth-
ing else, we should actually ask those 
people who are responsible for this bill 
just to come clean and try and make 
sure that they write the bill so there is 
consistency so you don’t have con-
flicting acts, because you have con-
flicting policy with this. 
And this bill also provides some huge 
loopholes for big, well-funded zoos and 
will crush those small but well-regu-
lated private facilities. That is not the 
way we should be running that par-
ticular policy. 
Madam Speaker, the smaller facili-
ties are well-regulated. It is done by 
the Department of Agriculture. There 
are specific rules and guidelines. The 
laws are specific and they are there. 
What this bill will do is put con-
flicting guidelines, which means, pass 
this bill, if you wish, but—well, very 
little chance of it actually going all 
the way, but even if you want to pass 
this bill, you are going to have to come 
back and fix the two because you have, 
now, two bills that are still on the 
books that are in conflict. So at least 
do it the right way. 
This bill was pushed by special inter-
est groups. It is poor policy that is not 
backed by science but is backed by rad-
ical ideology, and it does not fit the re-
ality of what is taking place. The De-
partment of Agriculture is doing their 
functions properly and effectively and 
efficiently, and we should not pass this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, with all the signifi-
cant things we could be doing in a 
lameduck session, with all the stuff we 
can do with the pandemic, with both 
Republicans and Democrats in both the 
House and the Senate agreeing on so 
many things, so much low-hanging 
fruit, we could easily pass something 
that would have a major impact, some-
thing that would be real, or actually 
put the NDAA on here and do some-
thing that is real, or actually come to 
an agreement on a CR, at least, if not 
the resolutions of all our appropria-
tions. That would be big. That would 
be sufficient. That would be worthy of 
us actually coming back here to the 
floor today. 
But instead, we are coming here clos-
er to 8 o’clock at night dealing with 
the small stuff, the insignificant stuff 
that is not going to go further through-
out the process, which I guess is one of 
the reasons I think we should be happy. 
At least we know this will be the last 
time that this will be discussed here in 
the Capitol building at any time. 
Madam Speaker, as a Congress, we 
can do much better. We ought to do 
much better. We ought not to spend 
our time coming up here dealing with 
the kleinigkeiten. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I appreciate, again, the comments 
from the ranking member, but I think 
he is out of step with the majority in 
this House, given the bipartisan nature 
of this particular legislation. 
A couple of quick points to answer 
some of his objections. 
First of all, as I mentioned earlier, 
the Zoological Association of America 
has withdrawn its opposition to this 
bill. The Zoological Association of 
America, contrary to the statement, is 
not opposed to this bill. 
Second, he talks about the guidelines 
by the USDA being sufficient. They are 
obviously not sufficient when the sta-
tus quo across this country still has 
such a tremendous and deleterious im-
pact on animal welfare, as well as pre-
sents a continued risk for public safe-
ty. As was noted in some of the com-
ments earlier, in fact, we have a patch-
work of regulation across this country; 
whereas, it is time for us to have one 
uniform standard across this country 
that would apply everywhere. 
He complains that this bill is a mat-
ter of special interest. I would submit, 
if the special interests are those spe-
cial interests that are concerned about 
the welfare of animals and are con-
cerned about public safety, then those 
are good special interests to be aligned 
with. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 1380, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

RECOGNIZING JIMMY DODSON 
(Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great respect and honor that I rise 
today to recognize Jimmy Dodson as 
he completes his term as the chair of 
the Farm Credit Council Board of Di-
rectors. 
Jimmy is a third-generation farmer, 
and he grows cotton, corn, wheat, milo, 
and operates a seed sales business near 
Robstown, Texas, where he and his 
wife, Barbara, live today. 
Jimmy is a great leader in the cotton 
industry, as the past chair of the Na-
tional Cotton Council of America, the 
American Cotton Producers, and the 
Cotton Foundation. He is a founding 
member of Cotton LEADS, the cotton 
industry’s sustainability program, and 
a member of the boards of Cotton In-
corporated, the Texas Agricultural Co-
operative Council, and the Gulf Coast 
Cooperative. He was one of the first 
farm leaders to visit China to work to 
expand U.S. ag exports into that coun-
try. 
He is also a great leader within the 
cooperative 
Farm 
Credit 
System, 
which he first joined in 1974. Jimmy 
was first elected by his fellow south 
Texas farmers to represent them on the 
board of the Coastal Bend Production 
Credit Association in February 1982. 
Jimmy went on to become a lifelong 
board member of the Farm Credit Bank 
of Texas, where he serves today as 
board chair and oversees efforts to sup-
port farmers in Texas, New Mexico, 
Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. 
This year, Jimmy will complete his 
term as board chair of the Farm Credit 
Council, where he has led efforts to 
support farmers and farm families 
across the United States. 
Jimmy Dodson has devoted his life to 
agriculture, and our Nation’s farm 
families have benefited tremendously 
from his efforts. On behalf of the U.S. 
House 
of 
Representatives 
and 
the 
House Agriculture Committee, I extend 
my deepest gratitude to Jimmy for his 
tireless efforts and his tireless support 
of American farmers and ranchers. I 
wish him the very best as he continues 
his lifelong service to Texas and U.S. 
agriculture. 
f 
RESTAURANTS AND STORES ARE 
BEING FORCED TO SHUT THEIR 
DOORS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the 
Christmas season is here, a time during 
which our small businesses typically 
thrive, the season that gets them 
through much of the rest of the year 
fiscally. 
This year, however, restaurants and 
stores are forced into shutting their 
doors on much of Main Street America. 
However, 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program has saved 51 million jobs 
across the country. 
Speaker PELOSI could use this legis-
lative week to free up the remaining 
$135 billion in PPP reserves, but in-
stead we are voting on legalizing a 
schedule I narcotic, and then whether 
to pass a Carole Baskin anti-tiger bill. 
Now is not the time to play politics 
by withholding money that has been 
already allocated on behalf of small 
business. At the end of the year, if we 
do not use these funds, they will ex-
pire. 
I encourage all my colleagues to join 
me in signing the discharge petition for 
H.R. 8265, freeing up these funds imme-
diately and reviving the tested and ef-
fective PPP to save more small busi-
nesses this year, especially as govern-
ments clamp down even more so on 
their closures. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE CRYING OUT FOR 
RELIEF 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
American people are hungry. Ameri-
cans are losing their homes. And one 
American every 30 seconds is dying. We 
need to be able to address this question 
and address it immediately. 
We passed the HEROES Act so many 
months ago that had testing money. It 
had restaurant money for all our local 
restaurants. It had PPP to save busi-
nesses. It had PPE money in terms of 
helping getting the equipment that is 
needed to save nurses and doctors, but 
it was not done. 
There is no reason for us to leave this 
place without recognizing the Amer-
ican people are crying out for relief. I 
am willing to look very carefully at 
the bipartisan legislation that would 
include dollars for local governments 
finally and as much for education and 
vaccines. But the main message is the 
American people are crying out: Do 
something for us. 
We have done it as Democrats. I ex-
tend my hand of friendship so that we 
can negotiate, pass legislation to save 
lives in America. COVID–19 is raging. 
Let’s do something about it. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CAPE ASSIST 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize Cape Assist, a 
substance misuse prevention and treat-
ment agency which serves Cape May 
County in south Jersey. 
From prevention and education pro-
grams for our community to recovery 
services for those in need, the services 
that they offer are invaluable. They 
are invaluable to our community and 
to the lives that they literally help 
save. 
During this pandemic, people have, 
unfortunately, turned to more drugs 
and more alcohol and more substance 
abuse. Cape Assist helps individuals 
who are struggling with these addic-
tions to turn the corner of their addic-
tions and help them to get better. 
I thank the staff of Cape Assist for 
the diligent and lifesaving work they 
do to ensure our community is edu-
cated in these issues and that those in 
need have the support to get through 
the most difficult times of their lives. 
Keep up the great work, Cape Assist. 
God bless you and God bless the work 
that you do. 
f 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET THEIR 
PRIORITIES STRAIGHT 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, with 
this body back to work this week, I was 
hoping we would be here to work and 
to address the ongoing health and eco-
nomic crisis. Unfortunately, that is not

the case. While small businesses and 
hardworking Americans struggle to get 
by, we are spending what little time we 
have left during this Congress voting 
on marijuana legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to get our pri-
orities straight and start governing re-
sponsibly. And we can do that right 
now by reopening the applications for 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, 
which still has $133 billion available to 
small businesses and workers trying to 
get through this crisis. 
Luckily, there is a way around the 
obstruction that currently exists in 
this body. I am one of the 186 members 
on the discharge petition that would 
bring H.R. 8265 to the floor for a vote. 
This commonsense legislation would 
reopen the applications for the Pay-
check Protection Program and give 
small businesses access to unspent 
money. Members of this body know 
how important this bill is in this cur-
rent situation. It is a shame that those 
who set the floor schedule are focused 
on advancing partisan priorities rather 
than rising to meet the challenges fac-
ing our workers and small businesses. 
f 
OTHER MEDICATIONS TO TREAT 
COVID–19 
SHOULD 
BE 
LOOKED 
INTO 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
past July, medical research teams at 
Israel’s Hebrew University in Jeru-
salem and New York’s Mount Sinai 
Hospital released a study indicating 
that 
the 
FDA-approved 
cholesterol 
drug 
fenofibrate 
may 
significantly 
downgrade the severity of COVID–19. 
The medical teams were led by He-
brew 
University 
Professor 
Ya’acov 
Nahmias and Mount Sinai’s Dr. Ben-
jamin tenOever. During their research, 
they found the novel coronavirus and 
studies conducted on human lung tis-
sue found that COVID–19 prevents the 
routine 
burning 
of 
carbohydrates, 
which leads to fat in the lungs, which 
causes people to die. 
What happens is that people take 
fenofibrate, which is a drug that was 
commonly used for high cholesterol 
treatment, and it stops this inflamma-
tion and improves people’s respiratory 
systems. 
Right now, these doctors are not 
given the support they should be given 
by the CDC and the NIH. We have a lot 
of people dying of coronavirus, and I 
think our people should not be too 
proud to recognize that sometimes 
cures are made in other countries. 
I strongly encourage the CDC to look 
at fenofibrate and these two great re-
searchers.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana (at the re-
quest of Mr. MCCARTHY) for December 2

of quarantining.

Thereupon (at 10 o’clock and 9 min-
utes p.m.), under its previous order, the

OATH OF OFFICE MEMBERS, RESIDENT 
COMMISSIONER, AND DELEGATES 
The oath of office required by the

S7191 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2020 
No. 204 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Holy God, who desires us to prosper 
and experience health, give our Nation 
such a harvest of righteousness that 
our land will be filled with peace, 
quietness, and unity. Use our law-
makers to enable our citizens to live in 
safety, confidence, and peace. 
As our Senators seek to serve You 
and country, give them the wisdom and 
courage to bring harmony from dis-
cord. Lord, be merciful to them as they 
wait with eager expectancy for Your 
guidance. 
May they honor the promises they 
make, living lives that reflect the in-
tegrity of Your Kingdom. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
DAINES). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
GIVING TUESDAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been 
known as Giving Tuesday. I suppose 
this Giving Tuesday is receiving more 
attention than usual because of the 
virus pandemic that we have been in 
for the last 12 months. Like many sec-
tors, the nonprofit industry is hurting 
because of COVID–19. 
As part of the CARES Act passed last 
March, Congress enacted key provi-
sions encouraging charitable giving to 
help support organizations that are 
being called upon more than ever to 
help Americans because of the virus 
pandemic. These charitable giving pro-
visions that are in the CARES Act 
apply both to individuals who itemize 
their taxes and those who do not 
itemize. 
Iowa is blessed to have an extensive 
network of charitable organizations 
that are supported by incredible volun-
teers who open up their pocketbooks to 
support their neighbors in need. This 
fall, Senator ERNST and I heard from at 
least 20 nonprofits in the Cedar Rapids 
area about the challenges that they 
face because of the pandemic and nat-
ural disasters, and also we heard of the 
successes they have had this year. 
The work that Iowa nonprofits do is 
inspiring and has tremendous impact. 
In this season of Thanksgiving, I speak 
on behalf of my own State to thank 
these organizations, their employees, 
and volunteers for the hard work and 
services that they deliver every day of 
the year to Iowans in need. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
anyone who has heard me speak about 
coronavirus relief going back months 
has heard one central principle: Let’s 
deliver right away on all the subjects 
where everybody agrees and argue over 
the rest later. The solution to this im-
passe has been in plain sight for a long 
time now for anybody willing to see it: 
Agree where we agree, bank that 
progress, make law, take a whole lot of 
pressure off struggling people, and then 
keep debating the areas where we don’t 
agree. 
There is no actual reason why the 
fates of commonsense policies like a 
second round of the job-saving Pay-
check Protection Program had to be 
linked to the fates of fringe proposals 
like stimulus checks for illegal immi-
grants. There is no reason why the fate 
of funding for vaccine distribution or 
extending unemployment aid or legal 
certainties for universities should have 
been tied to radical ideas like paying 
people more not to work than essential 
workers earn on the job. 
These linkages have been totally ar-
bitrary, just a political decision that 
Democratic leaders made many months 
back. Democratic leaders have tried to 
create a narrative where it is taken for 
granted 
that 
the 
most 
bipartisan, 
commonsensical relief policies would 
live or die with their side’s most out-
landish ideas. Well, that just isn’t so. 
They have tried to create a dynamic 
where they move from one made-up 
number to a second slightly smaller ar-
bitrary number and call it a meaning-
ful concession. The truth is simple. 
This has always been about policy dif-
ferences. We have two sides with two 
different visions for the best way to 
support our Nation through what we 
hope will be the last chapter of the 
pandemic. 
That isn’t new. We have disagree-
ments all the time. Our system can 
handle disagreements, but both sides 
have to be willing to compile their

commonalities and make law here, 
and, up to now, our Democratic col-
leagues have declined to do that. 
Remember, their side said in March 
this pandemic was ‘‘a tremendous op-
portunity to restructure things to fit 
our vision.’’ So when Republicans tried 
to pass commonsense relief measures 
in July, in September, and in October, 
as well, our Democratic colleagues ac-
tually blocked policies they do not 
even oppose. 
It has been heartening to see a few 
hopeful signs in the past few days. 
After months of arbitrary attachment 
to sky-high dollar amounts that the 
Speaker of the House claimed were es-
sential—that it would be an insult to 
settle for a nickel less—those baseless 
claims have suddenly evaporated. 
That is at least movement in the 
right direction, but the underlying re-
ality is still with us. There are many 
important policies that have strong bi-
partisan support. There are many oth-
ers that do not, and the way to help the 
country is for our Democratic col-
leagues to finally let the former group 
be signed into law while we keep argu-
ing over the rest. 
The targeted second round of pay-
check protection that we have been 
trying to establish since July would 
help a huge number of small businesses 
survive to the finish line and help huge 
numbers of workers to keep their jobs. 
And it can pass the Senate today, prob-
ably with 95 votes. 
With the apparent success of Oper-
ation Warp Speed, it makes no sense to 
skimp on the systems to distribute and 
deliver vaccines around the country. 
Those funds could pass the Senate 
today, possibly unanimously. 
University presidents have made it 
clear they need certainty for their re-
openings. Let me say that again. Uni-
versity presidents have made it clear 
they need legal certainty for their re-
openings. That shouldn’t be partisan. 
Liability protections should be able to 
pass the Senate today. 
A number of our Democratic col-
leagues have focused especially on sev-
eral of the unemployment relief pro-
grams that are set to expire in a mat-
ter of days. I specifically made sure to 
include those programs in my frame-
work a few days ago. That extension 
could pass the Senate today. 
The House of Representatives is 
spending this week on pressing issues 
like marijuana—marijuana—you know, 
serious and important legislation befit-
ting this national crisis. But here in 
the Senate, I put forward a serious and 
highly targeted relief proposal includ-
ing the elements which we know the 
President is ready and willing to sign 
into law. Why should these impactful 
and noncontroversial life preservers be 
delayed one second longer? 
At long last, let’s do what Congress 
does when we want an outcome. Let’s 
make law on all the subjects where we 
agree and on all the areas where Presi-
dent Trump is ready to sign bipartisan 
relief into law. 
I promise, our deep differences will 
still be here to debate. Our disagree-
ments will be right where we left them. 
But do you know what can’t wait? 
What can’t wait are American workers, 
American 
small 
businesses, 
K–12 
schools, the vulnerable Americans and 
frontline healthcare workers for whom 
speedy vaccine distribution will lit-
erally be a life-or-death matter. 
Yesterday, my home State of Ken-
tucky experienced yet another dread-
ful—dreadful—record-setting day. But 
Kentuckians also know that hope is in 
sight. Our State’s workers are standing 
by at the UPS Worldport in Louisville 
and the DHL Express American Hub in 
northern Kentucky, key logistics cen-
ters that will play crucial roles in 
sending vaccines all around the coun-
try. 
Our people are hurting, but they are 
ready to finish this fight. Congress 
should not keep them waiting for rein-
forcements that should have arrived 
literally months ago. 
So compromise is within reach. We 
know where we agree. We can do this. 
Let me say it again. We can do this, 
and we need to do this. So let’s be 
about actually making a law.

Waller, of Minnesota, to be a Member 
of the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System for a term of four-
teen years from February 1, 2016. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I was 
pleased that the Senate unanimously 
agreed yesterday to proceed to con-
ference on the 2021 National Defense 
Authorization Act. 
The NDAA is one of the most impor-
tant pieces of legislation that we pass 
here every year. It is the bill that au-
thorizes funding for our troops and lays 
out our defense priorities. 
Like the last two NDAAs, this year’s 
bill focuses on restoring military readi-
ness and ensuring that our Nation is 
prepared to meet threats posed by 
major powers like Russia and China. 
In November of 2018, the bipartisan 
National Defense Strategy Commission 
released a report warning that our 
readiness had eroded to the point that 
we might struggle to win a war against 
a major power like Russia or China, 
and the Commission noted that we 
would be especially vulnerable if we 
were ever called on to fight a war on 
two fronts. 
Over the past 2 years, we have made 
real progress on restoring military 
readiness, but we still have more work 
to do. 
This year’s National Defense Author-
ization Act continues our investment 
in ensuring that our military is pre-
pared to meet current and future 
threats in any domain. 
Of course, no matter what weapons or 
tanks or planes we have, our greatest 
military resource will always be our 
men and women in uniform, and this 
year’s NDAA invests in improving the 
quality of life for our military mem-
bers and their families. The bill sup-
ports a 3-percent pay raise for our 
troops, and it builds on previous meas-
ures to improve military healthcare 
and housing. It will also provide sup-
port for our military families in areas 
like childcare and professional develop-
ment for military spouses. 
As I said, this bill is one of the most 
important measures that we pass every 
year, and we need to make sure that we 
pass the final version of this legislation 
before Christmas. Failing to pass this 
legislation would send the wrong mes-
sage to our troops and our allies and to 
our adversaries. 
While this may not be a perfect bill, 
it contains a lot of important provi-
sions to rebuild our military and to 
give our men and women in uniform 
the tools they need to defend our Na-
tion. We need to pass it as soon as pos-
sible. 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ENZI 
Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, 
MIKE ENZI delivered his farewell ad-
dress. While MIKE
has more than 
earned his retirement over a long and 
dedicated career in Washington and in 
Wyoming, we are going to miss him 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
MIKE
is an accountant and spent 
years as a small business man, and he 
brought that background and common 
sense to Washington, DC, with him. 
In many ways, he has been the con-
science of the Senate on spending 
issues, reminding us that we don’t have 
an unlimited amount of money to 
spend and that every dollar we add to 
the debt is a burden that will have to 
be 
met 
by 
our 
children 
and 
grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7193 
December 3, 2020 
As chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, he has passed budgets with an 
eye to restraining spending and less-
ening the burden we place on future 
generations. His 2018 budget also paved 
the way for the landmark Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, which reformed America’s 
outdated Tax Code, helped create jobs 
and opportunities for workers, and put 
more money in the pockets of Amer-
ican families. 
MIKE
is an outstanding legislator, 
and he is also one of the finest human 
beings you will ever meet. I think all of 
us have benefited from his thoughtful-
ness at one time or another. I remem-
ber when I was experiencing heel pain a 
few years ago with an ailment called 
plantar fasciitis, and I mentioned it to 
MIKE because he was a shoe salesman 
and a shoe store owner. It wasn’t more 
than a few days later when MIKE came 
to me with some heel inserts to put 
into my shoes, which, I might add, 
helped a lot. Obviously, he had a lot of 
experience through the years dealing 
with people with foot issues. But it was 
typical of MIKE ENZI—thoughtful and 
practical, down-to-earth. 
In business, as everyone knows, the 
customer comes first, and MIKE has 
brought that attitude to his 24 years 
here in the U.S. Senate. As a shoe 
salesman, he put his customers first, 
and as a Senator, he always put his 
constituents and the American people 
first. He has never forgotten how to 
help people. He has never forgotten 
where he comes from. He has worked 
hard every day that he has been here in 
the Senate to make life better for the 
people of Wyoming and for American 
citizens. 
He is an outstanding colleague and a 
friend, and I will miss his wisdom and 
expertise—and his great fishing stories. 
MIKE, I wish you the very best of ev-
erything in your retirement. I am glad 
you will have more time to spend with 
Diana and the kids and grandkids and 
more time to enjoy your beloved home 
State of Wyoming. While no State will 
ever compare to South Dakota in my 
book, I have to say that Wyoming is 
spectacularly beautiful, and I am glad 
you will be able to be there now on 
more of a full-time basis. But you will 
be missed here. I want to thank you for 
your service and your friendship. May 
God bless you and your family in your 
retirement. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the floor. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today to talk a little bit about 
what is happening in Nevada. Last 
week, I had the opportunity to be 
home, and I went to one of our mobile 
food banks in East Las Vegas just be-
fore Thanksgiving. The mobile food 
bank is one of our food pantries 
throughout the State of Nevada, and 
this particular one is run by Three 
Square. I arrived around 8 a.m. in the 
morning to a line of cars waiting at the 
site. That line sometimes gets so long, 
police have to direct traffic around it. 
Literally, they lined up at 3 a.m. The 
food pantry doesn’t even open until 7 
or 8 in the morning, but they were 
there at 3 a.m., around the block, in 
their cars to stay safe from the COVID– 
19 pandemic. There were over 350 of 
them throughout that morning. That is 
not unusual with what is happening in 
Nevada right now. That is not unusual, 
and it should be, but because this pan-
demic has hit Nevada and so many 
States so hard, we are seeing the con-
sequences of inaction by this body in 
the Senate. 
As I got there that morning, I imag-
ined those people in the middle of the 
night with their lights and power off in 
their cars to save fuel in the cold 
desert night. And they waited pa-
tiently. They were quiet because they 
knew assistance would be there when 
morning came. And sometimes that 
food runs out for those many people 
who are waiting, and then they have to 
come the next day. But because of the 
inaction in this Chamber, most Nevad-
ans who are hurting don’t have that re-
assurance that there will be imme-
diate, swift relief for them because 
they don’t know when Federal help will 
come. Lifeline organizations like Three 
Square, which are working tirelessly to 
help families fill the gaps, are running 
out of resources. 
It has been 223 days since the Senate 
last approved funds to help all Ameri-
cans endure this once-in-a-lifetime ca-
tastrophe. Meanwhile, too many people 
in Nevada are languishing in the dark, 
hoping for economic assistance that 
still hasn’t arrived. 
In Nevada, we continue to have the 
second highest unemployment rate in 
the country at 12 percent. That is al-
most twice the national rate. Unem-
ployment is so high in Nevada because 
of the coronavirus pandemic. It has 
stopped conventions, entertainment, 
hospitality, and travel operations in 
the Silver State and across the coun-
try. In August, in Nevada, employment 
in travel and tourism was down 25 per-
cent over last year. Nationwide, spend-
ing on travel has declined by 42 percent 
compared to 2019. As a result, there are 
60 percent fewer travelers to McCarran 
International Airport in Las Vegas and 
50 percent fewer travelers to Las Vegas 
itself. The American Hotel and Lodging 
Association estimates that without 
more funding, nearly 70 percent of ho-
tels may close by the end of this year. 
Because of the devastation to what 
had been a thriving hospitality indus-
try in Nevada, many of the jobs aren’t 
there right now, and too many workers 
in Nevada can’t pay their bills. More 
than 175,000 people in the Silver State 
continue to claim unemployment in-
surance. People without jobs are strug-
gling right now to pay rent or mort-
gages or healthcare. 
Let me tell you, housing assistance 
from the CARES Act helped tens of 
thousands of Nevadans and millions of 
Americans keep a roof over their 
heads. That was legislation we passed 
immediately in a bipartisan way—one 
of four. But those funds have run out. 
They are gone, and they need to be re-
placed. When the limited CDC eviction 
moratorium expires on January 1, Ne-
vada is bracing for 250,000 to 400,000 
possible evictions. That is more than 20 
times the national number of evictions 
in 2019. 
Families 
and 
seniors 
can’t 
get 
enough to eat. In August and Sep-
tember, 234,000 Nevadans said their 
households were experiencing food in-
security. That is 11 percent of Nevada 
households going hungry—the second 
largest share in the country. One hun-
dred and twenty-nine thousand said 
that the children in their homes didn’t 
have enough food. 
The longer we delay passing addi-
tional economic relief, the more jeop-
ardy we create for our entire economy, 
nationwide. Don’t take my word for it; 
just listen to Chairman Powell of the 
Federal Reserve, who has been saying 
this over and over again—most re-
cently in a hearing in the Banking 
Committee, which I am a member of. 
The Senate must do more to help 
people not just in my home State but 
across the country, especially now, as 
case counts are climbing. We are only 
months away from being able to give 
the population at large immunity to 
this deadly virus. We have to do every-
thing we can to help people get to that 
time, to ensure that for the coming 
months, Nevadans can stay in their 
homes, they can take care of their 
kids, they can keep their businesses 
running, knowing that they will have 
an opportunity to open them in the fu-
ture, and they can protect themselves 
from this virus. The only way to do 
that is to get them the relief they need 
now. 
That relief simply has to include 
more money for State, local, and Trib-
al governments, which have had to cut 
back on critical services in the middle 
of a pandemic. 
It should include extended unemploy-
ment benefits and pandemic unemploy-
ment assistance, as well as more loans 
for our small businesses and for PPP. 
It must have housing assistance to 
prevent a wave of homelessness and ill-
ness. 
It should do more to protect workers, 
fund education, and stave off hunger 
for families. 
It also needs to include billions that 
States have asked for to help with vac-
cine distribution. We are going to be 
rolling out millions of doses of vac-
cines, all of which will need to be 
stored, handled, and tracked across 50 
States. Healthcare workers not just in 
Nevada but across the country will

need training to administer the vac-
cine, and the public needs education 
about vaccine safety and access. 
We have witnessed an amazing feat of 
human ingenuity in developing a vac-
cine faster than we have ever done it 
before, but the Federal Government 
and this Chamber still haven’t set 
money aside to make sure that vac-
cines get to those who need it. 
It also has to include money for test-
ing and tracing so that we can contain 
spread of this virus and get more peo-
ple back to work. 
Nobody should be standing in the 
way of a comprehensive, bipartisan re-
lief package to help Americans hold 
out until they can get the vaccines we 
know are coming. They need relief 
now. That is why I support the bipar-
tisan proposal that our colleagues in 
the Senate put together just recently. 
That proposal, which they look at in 
a comprehensive way for all of our 
States, includes money for State, local, 
and Tribal governments. It includes ad-
ditional unemployment insurance. It 
supports funding for small businesses, 
including 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, EIDL disaster loans, res-
taurants, stages, and deductibility. 
What I mean by stages are the live 
events in the hospitality industry that 
have been so devastated and have not 
received any relief during the time we 
have appropriated funds to address the 
pandemic. It includes CDFI, commu-
nity lender support. It includes trans-
portation—our airlines, our airports, 
our buses, our transit, Amtrak—and 
our workers there. It includes vaccine 
development and distribution and test-
ing and tracing. It includes money for 
healthcare provider relief. It includes 
money for education, for student loans, 
and, yes, housing assistance and rental 
assistance that is needed now. It also 
includes money for nutrition, for the 
food insecurity that I just talked about 
that I witnessed that morning in Las 
Vegas and that we hear about con-
stantly, not just in Nevada but across 
this country. It includes money for 
childcare, for broadband, for the U.S. 
Postal Service—so many things. 
It 
was 
well 
reasoned 
and 
com-
promised and thought out, and it was 
our colleagues coming together—Re-
publicans and Democrats coming to-
gether—for the best interests of this 
country. 
I will tell you, we do not need unani-
mous support for this proposal. What 
we need is a vote on the floor of the 
Senate. That is why I am asking MITCH 
MCCONNELL to allow this proposal to 
come to the floor of the Senate for a 
vote. If some of my colleagues don’t 
want to support any more relief, then 
they don’t have to vote for it. But I 
would guarantee and I would suspect 
that there are more than enough of my 
colleagues on both sides of aisle who 
want to pass relief for the many Ameri-
cans across this country in our States 
who are suffering right now, but they 
have to be given the opportunity. 
I get that right now, there is only 
one person who gets to decide what 
goes on the floor of the Senate. I don’t 
agree with that, but that is the way 
the rules are set. MITCH MCCONNELL de-
cides every single day what legislation 
comes to the floor of the Senate, what 
can be debated, what amendments can 
come. I have watched this for years as 
MITCH MCCONNELL, instead of including 
the Democrats in bipartisan negotia-
tion on some of these important bills, 
puts 
them 
together 
behind 
closed 
doors, 
with 
only 
Republicans 
and 
maybe the current administration, and 
then puts them on the floor of the Sen-
ate for the first time; bypasses our 
committee hearings, where there is bi-
partisan support, usually, for bills; by-
passes that and puts it on the floor of 
the Senate without any compromise, 
without any of the Democrats’ involve-
ment, and expects us to vote for it, and 
then holds the Democrats account-
able—accountable—because we didn’t 
have the opportunity to fight for our 
States and put important funding in 
there for State and local government, 
for broadband, for our healthcare work-
ers, for our hospitality industry—you 
name it. That is not the way the Sen-
ate should be operating. You know 
that, and I know that. 
We have to get back to a time when 
we compromise, when we all come rep-
resenting our States. We all have equal 
votes. There are two of us from each 
State. We are fighting for our constitu-
ents and our States, and we should be 
able to have that debate, that con-
versation, on the floor of the Senate in 
a fair manner. That is why I ask MITCH 
MCCONNELL to allow a vote on this pro-
posal. 
I had the opportunity to watch one of 
my colleagues talk about this. I abso-
lutely agree with him, Senator ANGUS 
KING. He said: I sit in these commit-
tees, in these bipartisan committees, 
and I vote for relief for disasters, hurri-
cane disasters, fire disasters—fires in 
the Western States where I come from 
and where you know so well that the 
fires 
are 
devastating 
our 
Western 
States. But for the hurricanes that 
happen in Texas, Florida—you name 
it—I vote for relief because I know 
those constituents in those States are 
suffering. I don’t look at them as blue 
States or red States. I look at them as 
Americans who are in need right now, 
and I am going to support that relief. 
Why are we doing that with this 
coronavirus relief package? I do not 
understand. It is not what the Amer-
ican people expect of us. It is not what 
they want, and it is not what they de-
serve. I cannot stress this enough: It is 
time for the Senate to get back to 
work on behalf of the American public. 
That means that we are willing to com-
promise. That means we are willing to 
do what is right and what is needed in 
our communities because I can guar-
antee you, any one of us who goes 
home to our State—we are all suf-
fering; we all see it. That is what the 
American people expect of us. 
I hope MITCH MCCONNELL allows a 
vote on the floor for this bipartisan 
compromise that the Senators have 
worked on. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Democratic leader is rec-
ognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me thank my colleague and friend, 
the senior Senator from the great 
State of Nevada, for her words. They 
are on point. I hope the Republican 
leader was listening. I hope our Repub-
lican colleagues were listening because 
her genuine concern for her State, 
which is suffering just like mine is— 
both States depend on entertainment 
and tourism. It is real. We all want to 
get something done, and we are all 
willing to give to get something done, 
but the Republican leader holds the 
key, and we hope he is open to com-
promise. I will have more to say on 
that in a minute, but I thank her for 
her comments. 
We all know how desperate things 
are. Yesterday, we were leveled by 
some of the grimmest statistics of the 
pandemic. More than 100,000 Americans 
were hospitalized; more than 2,700 
Americans died, the highest recorded 
number in a single day since the pan-
demic began; more than 274,000 Ameri-
cans have died in total. That is the 
equivalent of a 9/11 attack every day 
for 92 days in a row. 
Unlike the spring, when the rates of 
infections and fatalities peaked before 
steadily declining, the winter months 
and the hangover from Thanksgiving 
travel will likely cause these rates to 
get worse before they get better. 
The steady yet staggering loss of 
American life is horrific. And because 
so many of us are isolated, because so 
many have contracted the disease and 
have experienced relatively mild symp-
toms and recovered quickly—thank 
God—there is a sense that things are 
not as bad as they seem. But the raw 
accounting is unavoidable, and it is 
harrowing. The loss of our friends, our 
parents, our neighbors, our siblings, 
our colleagues must be acknowledged 
and mourned and must inspire us to re-
double our efforts to defeat this evil 
disease. 
As COVID–19 races through much of 
the country, the economic fallout of 
the pandemic also broadens. Many fam-
ily budgets and small businesses are at 
their breaking point. 
Economists are now warning that the 
U.S. economy could fall into double-dip 
recession 
without 
additional 
relief 
from Congress. Let me say that again. 
We could have a double-dip recession 
unless there is relief—good, strong re-
lief from Congress. That is why Demo-
crats have been so desperately trying 
to convince our Republican colleagues 
and the Republican leader, in par-
ticular, to work with us in a bipartisan 
fashion on another round of emergency 
Federal relief.

offer to Leader MCCONNELL and Leader

S7195 
December 3, 2020 
MCCARTHY
on Monday in hopes of 
jump-starting 
serious 
negotiations. 
Leader MCCONNELL responded by circu-
lating another version of a partisan, 
Republican-only draft. 
In the spirit of compromise, Speaker 
PELOSI
and I believe the bipartisan 
framework introduced by a group of 
eight Senators on Tuesday should be 
used as the basis, the framework, for 
immediate bipartisan, bicameral nego-
tiations. Of course, we and others will 
offer improvements, but the need to 
act is urgent, and we believe that with 
good-faith negotiations, we could very 
well come to an agreement. 
We are already much closer to an 
agreement because of the bipartisan 
talks these eight Senators have cre-
ated, and we can build off their mo-
mentum. 
What 
is 
the 
alternative—another 
round of legislative failure, a failure to 
help the American people? The Repub-
lican leader came to the floor this 
morning to say ‘‘compromise is within 
reach’’—his words—before reiterating a 
long list of Republican demands and 
blaming the Democrats for everything. 
Once again, the Republican leader ar-
gued that the Senate should pass only 
what Republicans approve of and leave 
the rest for later, and he now says that 
an emergency relief bill should be lim-
ited by only what President Trump will 
sign. 
Of course, we could say, similarly, 
that the bill should be limited only by 
what a Democratic House will pass. 
Neither is true compromise. The 
leader knows that. But for some rea-
son, in the midst of this generational 
crisis, Republican Leader MCCONNELL 
does not seem inclined to compromise 
to actually get something done. But 
what he wants to do is posture, to put 
partisan bills on the floor and say: 
Take it or leave it. 
The real answer here is to sit down 
and talk. Let’s use the bipartisan 
framework developed by eight Senators 
from both sides as our starting point. 
We have precious little time left be-
fore the end of the year. The country 
has some desperate needs. Unemploy-
ment remains too high. Laid-off work-
ers need our assistance until the econ-
omy fully recovers. Small businesses 
need another round of support. 
With the imminent availability of a 
vaccine, it is crucial that there be ad-
ditional funding for manufacturing and 
distribution. The distribution efforts 
will be led by the States, which further 
increases the need to deliver assistance 
to State and local governments. 
As we all take great hope and solace 
in the idea that a vaccine is just 
around the corner, we must make nec-
essary preparations to ensure that we 
have enough doses; that it is distrib-
uted effectively, efficiently and fairly; 
and that Americans can access it 
affordably. 
We can make a significant downpay-
ment, right now, toward preparing the 
country for a vaccine with an emer-
gency relief bill before the Christmas 
holiday. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
TRIBUTE TO SENATORS LAMAR ALEXANDER, 
MIKE ENZI, PAT ROBERTS, AND CORY GARDNER 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor today to pay tribute to 
friends and colleagues who will be leav-
ing the Senate at the start of the new 
Congress. 
I consider LAMAR ALEXANDER, who 
spoke yesterday, to be a friend and a 
mentor. He is an institution around 
here. He is what I would consider an 
old-school Senator in the best way. He 
not only takes the time to learn the 
issues, but he also understands how to 
explain the importance of the policies 
that we work on up here to the people 
back home. By embodying the prin-
ciples of collegiality and bipartisan-
ship, he has accomplished a lot for the 
people of Tennessee and all Americans. 
In the Senate, you need 59 other Sen-
ators to say ‘‘That is a good idea’’ to 
get anything accomplished. It is crit-
ical, then, to get to know your col-
leagues, learn about how to work with 
them constructively to get things 
done. LAMAR ALEXANDER is masterful 
at that. 
We have accomplished a lot under his 
leadership on a lot of important issues. 
In the interest of time, I will mention 
two recent examples where I worked 
with LAMAR and watched him make a 
difference in the lives of all Americans. 
First, his 21st Century Cures Act, 
which passed back in 2016, provided 
needed authorization for investments 
in the National Institutes of Health 
and other research institutions to help 
create new breakthroughs in treat-
ments and cures for cancer, Alz-
heimer’s, and other diseases, as well as 
advancements in developing medical 
treatments tailored to each person’s 
individual 
genome. 
It 
was 
groundbreaking work. 
It probably got less notice, but it 
also 
authorized 
an 
unprecedented 
amount of funding in the State opioid 
response 
grants 
to 
combat 
opioid 
epidemics that have hit almost all of 
our States. Certainly, it has hit Ohio 
and Tennessee hard. This has served as 
an absolutely exceptional complement 
to what is called the Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act, which we 
passed earlier that year. Without the 
21st Century Cures Act, we would not 
have 
made 
the 
progress 
we 
have 
achieved in the past few years in turn-
ing the tide of this deadly disease, and 
I have seen it firsthand in my State 
and around the country. 
We also could not have accomplished 
the landmark Restore Our Parks Act 
without his help. This bill, now law, 
will help to rebuild our national park 
infrastructure by helping to address 
that backlog of $12 billion now in main-
tenance projects. Over 100,000 jobs will 
be created in the next 5 years due to 
this legislation. 
LAMAR didn’t care about getting the 
credit for this historic bill, by the 
way—probably the most important bill 
for conserving lands in 50 years. He 
just wanted to get it done. I saw that 
as he worked tirelessly in public and 
behind the scenes to ensure we got it 
across the finish line. 
Jane and I have cherished our time 
together with you and Honey, LAMAR, 
and we hope that will continue. 
Here in the Senate, we will miss your 
experience, your wisdom, your spirit of 
bipartisanship, and your perseverance 
and determination to advance our 
country’s priorities and get things 
done. 
Another colleague who has focused 
on results is Senator MIKE ENZI, a true 
son of Wyoming, who has represented 
his home State with class in this 
Chamber for nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury. MIKE is someone I have gotten to 
know and respect over the past decade 
as we have served together here in the 
Senate. 
In his time here on the Hill, MIKE has 
accomplished a lot for Wyoming. As 
chair of the HELP Committee, he 
helped lead the way on crucial pension 
reforms—complicated stuff but really 
important. He promoted greater access 
to education and affordable healthcare 
and pushed for improvements to work-
place safety. He was always willing to 
reach across the aisle. 
Over the past three Congresses, he 
has embraced his past life as an ac-
countant and used his position as chair 
of the Senate Budget Committee to 
push for smarter spending here in 
Washington. That is a perspective we 
will really miss in this time of explod-
ing deficits. 
I have to say, I am a bit envious of 
MIKE’s post-Senate career plans. As he 
tells me, he is going back to Wyoming 
to spend time with Diana and his won-
derful family and to spend more time 
on the rivers of Wyoming with his fly 
rod. 
MIKE, I hope sometime soon I will be 
able to come out to Gillette to join you 
and Diana so you can show me your fa-
vorite fishing spots. Congratulations 
on a well-deserved retirement. 
We are saying goodbye to another 
giant of the Senate this year when Sen-
ator PAT ROBERTS leaves us. I saw Sen-
ator ROBERTS on the floor here a mo-
ment ago. I see him now. 
I view PAT ROBERTS as the Matt Dil-
lon of the United States Senate. Matt 
Dillon, for those of you who know who 
he was, was a resident of Dodge City, 
just like PAT, and like Marshal Dillon 
and the marine he is proud to be, PAT 
knows how to lay down the law. But he 
does it with humor and smiles and a 
wink, and he does it in a way with that 
dry Kansas sense of humor that is very 
effective. By the way, he is always 
looking for Miss Kitty. 
He has used that combination of 
toughness and hard work and humor to 
accomplish a lot here in Congress. 
PAT’s focus has always been on the peo-
ple of Kansas. He has done a lot for the 
people of Kansas, but his work went far 
beyond Kansas. 
It turns out he is the only person in 
America to have chaired the Agri-
culture Committee both in the House

and in the Senate. His tireless work to 
pass farm bills over those years to help 
growers and ranchers has made him a 
friend to farmers everywhere, even in 
Ohio. 
Just as important was his work as 
chair of the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee. Some may not recall this, but 
he is the one who spearheaded the re-
forms to our intelligence services after 
9/11 to avoid another such tragedy. 
PAT, I hope you and Franki get a 
well-deserved retirement, and I look 
forward to continuing to stay in touch. 
We are also going to be losing a rel-
atively young and energetic Member of 
our caucus here, who is also an accom-
plished 
bipartisan 
legislator, 
when 
CORY GARDNER leaves next year. With 
only a few short years in the Senate 
here, CORY has proven he knows how to 
get things done, using his background 
in the House and his friendships to be 
effective for Colorado and the country. 
He is a smart guy, and we have worked 
together on a lot of critical issues to 
address some of the biggest issues fac-
ing our country. 
Like almost all Coloradans, he loves 
the outdoors. His work for conserva-
tion in the outdoors is something that 
I have had an opportunity to work with 
him on, including the historic Great 
American Outdoors Act, which was 
signed into law recently by the Presi-
dent. It includes the Restore Our Parks 
Act, but also a passion of his was the 
permanent funding for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, which has 
been a long-sought goal of the con-
servation and environmental commu-
nity. Frankly, it could not have been 
done without CORY’s involvement—pe-
riod. 
CORY, we are going to miss your 
sunny disposition. 
He may be the most optimistic Mem-
ber of the U.S. Senate. He always has a 
smile on his face. Even when things 
seem bad, he manages a way for them 
to look good. 
I will miss working with you on some 
of these important projects. I wish you 
the very best as you start the next 
stage of your career. 
We are also sad to see MARTHA 
MCSALLY go. I have appreciated get-
ting to know her over the past couple 
of years. In a short period of time, she 
was a passionate advocate for Arizona 
as a member of the Armed Services 
Committee. She used her own trail-
blazing path as the first female fighter 
pilot to have flown in combat to advo-
cate for our men and women in uni-
form. We worked together on bipar-
tisan legislation, as an example, to end 
cosmetics animal testing. She was in-
volved in a lot of different issues. 
We want to thank you for all you 
have done in the Chamber, and I look 
forward to staying in touch. 
Senator TOM UDALL has joined us 
here in the Chamber. I call Senator 
UDALL ‘‘Cousin’’ because of his cousin 
Mark Udall and our friendship. TOM 
UDALL has now served for 12 years in 
the U.S. Senate for the people of New 
Mexico. I have gotten to know him 
over that time through our work to-
gether on a number of different legisla-
tive projects. Most have been around 
conservation and the environment. We 
have had a lot of success in that re-
gard. 
We have been cochairs together of 
what is called the International Con-
servation Caucus. There is legislation 
called the Tropical Forest Conserva-
tion Act, which we have been able to 
work together on to get reauthorized. 
This has been incredibly important leg-
islation. Probably the No. 3 or 4 source 
of CO2 emissions in the world is the 
burning forest, and this has managed 
to save many millions of acres from 
the burning by simply saying to these 
countries: We will do a debt-for-nature 
swap with you. If you owe a debt to the 
United States—which, by the way, 
many are unlikely to ever pay any-
way—we will let you use that in ex-
change for protecting your forest. 
It has been remarkably successful. At 
a time when we seem to have a lot of 
partisanship and fights around here 
about global warming and climate 
change, this is one area in which we 
have been able to find common ground, 
and that is because TOM has been will-
ing to step up and be a great partner in 
that. 
He has also helped me pass legisla-
tion that requires that the U.S. Postal 
Service use its inventory of the Save 
Vanishing Species stamps to help pro-
tect the rich wildlife and natural re-
sources that we have and protect en-
dangered species. This has resulted in 
$5 million to $6 million a year going to-
ward that effort. Unfortunately, we 
have had to convince the Postal Serv-
ice to continue allowing that great 
source of funding to be there for our 
vanishing species. Again, TOM has been 
very helpful in that. 
Even in these past months, we 
haven’t stopped our work on environ-
mental issues. Earlier this year, we in-
troduced the bipartisan REPLANT Act 
to help the U.S. Forest Service address 
the 
growing 
reforestation 
backlog 
across our country. This is supported 
by the Trump administration. It is also 
supported by TOM UDALL. Therefore, we 
are hoping it can get done. 
He leaves the Senate with a legacy of 
tirelessly working to protect the nat-
ural beauty of his State and our coun-
try for future generations, and we wish 
him well in the future as he and Jill 
continue to work on those issues to-
gether. 
Finally, our colleague DOUG JONES is 
going to be departing after serving the 
people of Alabama for the past couple 
of years. I have gotten to know DOUG 
through our bipartisan efforts that 
have focused on standing up to unfair 
trade practices. Our Trade Security 
Act to reform section 232, I think, is 
the right approach to be sure we hold 
those accountable who violate our 
trade laws but to also do it in a way 
that 
protects 
American 
jobs 
and 
strengthens our U.S. economy. I will 
miss DOUG as a bipartisan partner in 
that effort, and I appreciate his work-
ing with us on those trade issues and 
other things. 
The Senate is a body that is really 
driven by personal relationships be-
tween 100 Members. Senators ALEX-
ANDER, 
ENZI, 
ROBERTS, 
GARDNER, 
MCSALLY, UDALL, and JONES have been 
key and valuable Members of that 100- 
person group, and we are going to miss 
them. They have all served this body 
well as legislators and as people. They 
are of high character. They are the 
kind of folks with whom you want to 
work, and they have been effective be-
cause of that. They will be missed, and 
I wish them all well.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4810 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
am on the floor today to discuss a 
question of fundamental fairness to 
members of our Armed Forces and to 
Federal employees. 
I think we all may recall a few 
months ago when President Trump or-
dered the Department of the Treasury 
to establish a system to push busi-
nesses, 
companies, 
and 
employers 
around the country to defer the collec-
tion of employees’ payroll taxes. Those 
are the taxes that go to Social Secu-
rity and Medicare. The key word here 
is ‘‘defer’’ because this is really a shell 
game. 
Any moneys that businesses do not 
pay into Social Security and Medicare 
now are going to have to be paid by 
those Federal employees right after the 
holidays, starting in January. 
And many employees around the 
country were at first confused. They 
thought they were getting a payroll 
tax holiday, but that is not the case. 
The reality is, whatever they didn’t 
pay in the form of payroll taxes now 
and in the past couple months they 
would be required to pay back right 
after those holidays. 
And when businesses looked at this 
and 
when 
workers 
and 
employees 
around the country looked at this, 
they overwhelmingly rejected it. They 
said they didn’t want to participate. 
Here is what UPS said about this pro-
posal: ‘‘We recognize that for some, it 
may have been helpful to have more 
money in their paychecks in 2020, yet 
not all employees have professional tax 
planning needed to prepare effectively 
for the added obligation they would 
face in 2021.’’ 
So even though this payroll tax de-
ferral proposal got a burst of attention, 
it turned out to be meaningless for 
most workers around the country. 
Most private sector employers didn’t 
participate, and their employees and 
workers didn’t want them to partici-
pate. 
Unfortunately, the one big exception 
to this has been members of our Armed 
Forces, the folks who every day stand 
guard to protect our country, and Fed-
eral employees who do the Nation’s 
business with respect to important 
services they provide. 
And as the private sector has re-
jected this, we have heard from thou-
sands of Federal employees who say: 
We don’t want to participate either. We 
have heard from members of the Armed 
Forces that say: We don’t want to be 
used as guinea pigs and be required to 
participate. 
So I want to be really clear that if we 
don’t correct this, the damage will con-
tinue to be done, and these members of 
our Armed Forces and Federal employ-
ees will be forced to pay even more 
back after the holidays. 
Now, I wrote to Treasury Secretary 
Mnuchin and to OMB Director Vought 
about this back in September, Sep-
tember 8, just as the deferral was start-
ing, and we were joined in that letter 
by 22 Senators—Senators from both 
sides of the aisle. We had a simple bi-
partisan request. It was: Make this 
payroll tax deferral optional, make it 
voluntary. If Federal employees and 
members of our Armed Forces want to 
participate in this proposal, fine. Let 
them do it, but don’t force, don’t re-
quire, don’t coerce members of our 
military and Federal employees to par-
ticipate. 
And we didn’t get a response to that 
letter to Secretary Mnuchin and CBO 
Director Vought. So I asked Secretary 
Mnuchin about this issue at a Senate 
Banking Committee hearing on Sep-
tember 24. I said: Mr. Secretary, why 
shouldn’t we make this voluntary? 
Why should you require members of 
our Armed Forces and Federal employ-
ees to participate in the program if 
they don’t want to? And his response 
was: Yeah, it would be ‘‘reasonable’’ for

December 3, 2020 
the payroll tax to be voluntary ‘‘if peo-
ple don’t want to participate. Sounds 
like common sense.’’ 
Well, we expected some followup 
from the Secretary of Treasury. Noth-
ing. So we sent a followup letter— 
again, a bipartisan letter. Nothing. 
So now it is December, and the 
Trump administration is still forcing 
members of our Armed Forces and Fed-
eral employees who don’t want to par-
ticipate in this now-forced deferral pro-
gram—they want to continue to force 
them to do it. So we introduced a bi-
partisan piece of legislation called the 
Protecting Employees from Surprise 
Taxes Act. It is pretty straightforward. 
It says: If a Federal employee or mem-
ber of the armed services wants to par-
ticipate, let them participate. If they 
want to opt out, let them opt out of it. 
I want to stress that the Federal 
workers we have heard from and the 
organizations and unions that rep-
resent Federal workers strongly sup-
port this measure. And why not? It is 
hard to argue that we shouldn’t let the 
folks who are standing guard to protect 
us make a choice about whether they 
want to participate in this program. 
Also, just to remind our colleagues— 
maybe they haven’t kept track of 
this—the Senate chose not to partici-
pate. The Senate chose not to partici-
pate in this program, whether on a 
mandatory or a voluntary basis. The 
House of Representatives chose not to 
participate in this program. 
So it is going to be interesting to 
hear the Senators say that they want 
to require members of our Armed 
Forces and Federal employees to enroll 
in a program that this Senate decided 
was not good for members of the Sen-
ate staff and the House of Representa-
tives decided was not good for House 
staff. 
Yet, if we don’t support this proposal, 
this is simply passing the bipartisan 
legislation I mentioned to give our 
members of the Armed Forces and Fed-
eral employees that choice. If we don’t 
pass this, we are going to require them 
to continue to participate in a program 
they don’t like. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Finance Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4810 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that 
the bill be read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I am here to ex-
press support for this payroll tax holi-
day, and I think Congress should do 
much better than that, and that is to 
come together and forgive these taxes, 
period. 
In fact, back in March, I pushed for 
Congress to include a payroll tax cut in 
the CARES Act, and I still support that 
today because the payroll tax cut is 
about supporting workers who might 
have had their hours reduced. 
These are workers who are living 
paycheck to paycheck, workers across 
our country who are struggling to 
make ends meet because of the impact 
of COVID–19 on our economy. 
Allowing folks to keep more of their 
hard-earned money could make a big 
difference. It would provide immediate 
support—immediate support—for Mon-
tana’s families who are struggling to 
get by. And, importantly, we ensure 
that this will have no impact—zero im-
pact—on Social Security because we 
transfer money from the general fund 
to the Treasury. 
This is not a new concept. It has been 
done by Congress. In fact, it was done 
under the Obama administration. As an 
example, a Montanan who earns an an-
nual salary of about $40,000 typically 
pays about $2,500 in payroll taxes every 
year. Forgiving the taxes deferred dur-
ing this 4-month payroll tax deferral 
would save that Montanan about $827. 
What we should be doing is working 
together to pass a COVID relief pack-
age that delivers much needed aid for 
families who have had a tough go the 
last several months. And it is going to 
get tougher going forward, not only for 
these families but workers and small 
businesses. 
Instead, my colleagues across the 
aisle have continued to block very tar-
geted relief, several times, right here 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate, which 
is holding Montanans and the Amer-
ican people hostage. We should come 
together and agree on this targeted re-
lief. We can continue to disagree on 
these other items, but let’s get this 
targeted relief package passed. 
So instead of coming to the floor 
today to try to pass a bill that under-
mines a payroll tax holiday to save 
folks more of their hard-earned money, 
I urge my colleague here before us to 
work with Members of his caucus and 
get the COVID–19 relief passed. 
Once again, we should be forgiving 
these taxes as a payroll tax holiday, 
not unlike what happened during the 
Obama administration, and for these 
reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator for Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
just to respond to the Senator from 
Montana, I think he well knows that it 
has been over 6 months since the House 
of Representatives passed the first He-
roes Act with comprehensive COVID–19 
relief. They have also passed an up-
dated ‘‘Heroes 2 Act,’’ but we never 
even had a vote here in the U.S. Senate 
on 
that 
provision. 
We 
have 
been 
blocked from having that vote by the 
Republican leader. 
I don’t know where my colleague 
stands on the bipartisan framework 
that was just released. That is some-
thing that I can support and pursue, 
but listening to the Senate majority 
leader, he has been pouring cold water 
on it. And, by the way, the measure 
that the Senator from Montana men-
tioned that we should pass right now 
for coronavirus relief, that doesn’t 
have a payroll tax holiday. It doesn’t 
do what the Senator just said he wants 
to do. It doesn’t say anything about 
that. 
So if the Senator or others want to 
introduce legislation to have a payroll 
tax holiday for those who have been en-
rolled in this program for the last 4 
months, go ahead. But why would you 
allow another day to pass requiring 
members of our Armed Forces who 
don’t want to participate to participate 
to participate or requiring Federal em-
ployees who are out there providing 
public services to participate? That is 
all this does. This doesn’t preclude 
anything the Senator talked about 
doing. All it does is to say: Right now, 
for those people who are calling who 
don’t want to be enrolled in this pro-
gram, let them out. Let them out. 
And what the Senator from Montana 
is saying is: No, I want to continue to 
hold them hostage to pass a proposal 
that isn’t even in the majority leader’s 
own bill. 
And that is what people get sick and 
tired about around this country. 
So let’s just pass this. This is a sim-
ple, straightforward bill. I welcome de-
bate on the bipartisan proposal that 
has been put forward by a number of 
Republican Senators and a number of 
Democratic Senators, but don’t try and 
mix this up into that larger debate. 
This is very simple. It just says to a 
member of the Army, the Navy or any 
of the services who doesn’t want to be 
forced to participate in this right now 
that they don’t have to. That is what 
this says, and by opposing this, you are 
saying that you want to prolong the re-
quirement that they participate in a 
program that they don’t want to be a 
part of. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the Senator from Maryland rais-
ing these points. In regard to the pro-
posal of the bill that was passed by 
NANCY PELOSI, the Speaker of House, 
the reason we didn’t take a vote on 
that bill in the U.S. Senate is because 
it was full, basically, of her wish list of 
many items that didn’t really relate to 
COVID–19 relief. We did put a targeted 
bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 
the amount of $600 billion that, frank-
ly, addressed many of the issues that 
the House had in their bill, and we had 
many issues that we agreed on here in 
the Senate that would be at least tar-
geted. This is about the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. This is relief for 
schools. This is resources for the vac-
cine, for additional PPE, for additional 
testing. It is a long list, including re-
lief for the U.S. Postal Service. Of 
course, I would hope that you would 
support it, but we were blocked from 
even bringing that bill to the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. We couldn’t get to de-
bate on that bill in September when it 
came before the U.S. Senate.

S7199 
December 3, 2020 
I appreciate these points. Obviously, 
we have a disagreement. President 
Trump pushed for Congress to pass a 
payroll tax cut. I would rather see a 
cut, not a deferral. That is the way to 
really help workers across this coun-
try. When Congress failed to act in 
July, the President enacted that defer-
ral as a way to provide immediate re-
lief to the American people. I would 
ask that we come together and let’s 
forgive those taxes. Forgive them, and 
they won’t be getting a surprise tax in-
crease if we do that. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
just very briefly in response, I think 
everyone knows what is going on here. 
This is a very simple proposal. If you 
want 
to 
participate 
in 
President 
Trump’s deferral, you can continue to 
participate in the deferral program. 
But if you are in the Armed Forces or 
are a Federal employee and you are 
being required to do that right now and 
you don’t want to, we should let them 
opt out. That is all this is about, and I 
am really surprised that our Repub-
lican colleagues would block members 
of our Armed Forces and Federal em-
ployees from making a simple choice 
which they believe is in their best in-
terest. 
So I am disappointed with the objec-
tion and will continue to pursue this. 
Thank you.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
RECOGNIZING THE STAFF OF 
SENATOR ALEXANDER 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
here is my view of serving in the U.S. 
Senate: It is hard to get here, it is hard 
to stay here, and while you are here, 
you might as well try to accomplish 
something good for the country. Ac-
complishing something good in the 
U.S. Senate means working with a su-
perior staff. 
Today, I want to pay tribute to the 
270 men and women who have served on 
my staff since I came to the Senate in 
2003, in my personal office, both here in 
Washington, DC, and in the six Ten-
nessee offices; in the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee; the Senate Rules Committee; 
the Senate Appropriations Committee; 
and at the Senate Republican con-
ference. 
Some who started with me in 2003 are 
still working for me after 18 years, and 
some have moved on to other opportu-
nities, but each has played a major role 
in the Senate, whether they were help-
ing to pass laws, serve our constitu-
ents, or answering the front-office 
phone. 
We have some important traditions 
here in the Senate, including the maid-
en speech, which I delivered 17 years 
ago, in my case, and the farewell 
speech, which I delivered yesterday, 
but for me, something is missing. Usu-
ally staff is acknowledged in the fare-
well address, which either makes the 
address way too long or at least too lit-
tle time to properly acknowledge their 
contributions. I am here today to make 
a ‘‘Salute to the Staff’’ speech. I know 
my colleagues agree that their own ac-
complishments are the result of work-
ing with superior staff, so perhaps, if I 
may not be presumptuous, a ‘‘Salute to 
the Staff’’ speech might become an ad-
ditional Senate tradition. 
When I say ‘‘superior staff,’’ here is 
what I mean: superior in being what 
Senator Howard Baker used to call an 
eloquent listener—that the constituent 
on the phone might be right or even 
the staffer in the other office might be 
right; superior in courtesy to the Ten-
nesseans for whom we work; superior 
in insight; superior in resolving com-
plex issues and wrapping up the result 
in a nice package with a ribbon tied 
around it, ready to be passed and 
signed into law whenever the moment 
came that it could be passed, which 
would usually be a surprise and at an 
inconvenient time; and superior in 
writing and speaking plain English in 
order to persuade at least half the peo-
ple we are right; and superior in work-
ing well together—something you are 
supposed to learn in kindergarten—so 
we have a good time while we are 
working. 
Unlike almost every other Senate of-
fice, at the suggestion of my chief of 
staff, David Cleary, we created a single 
team composed of personal office staff 
here and in Washington, DC, and the 
committee staff, with David in charge 
of all of that. I originally thought that 
was a big mistake. I didn’t see how 
anyone could be in charge of all of 
that, but I was wrong about it because 
what it did was break down barriers 
and eliminate jealousy, improve com-
munication, and create a much happier 
and effective working condition. 
The results have been exceptional. 
For 18 years, I have gotten up every 
morning thinking I might be able to do 
something good to help our country, 
and I have gone to bed most nights 
thinking that I have. That couldn’t 
have happened without the privilege of 
working with an exceptional staff. 
The truth is—we all know this—that 
there is just no physical way for any 
U.S. Senator to see every single one of 
our constituents every time we want to

see them or talk to them on the phone, 
although we all make our best efforts 
to do that. And you learn pretty quick-
ly that constituents expect and deserve 
to be treated not just with courtesy 
but promptly. For example, Senator 
Estes Kefauver held this seat that I 
now hold when I was a high school stu-
dent. 
One day, Maude from Madisonville, 
his 
hometown, 
called 
Senator 
Kefauver’s office and said: ‘‘I want to 
speak to Estes.’’ 
The staffer said: ‘‘I’m sorry but Sen-
ator Kefauver is tied up on the floor.’’ 
There was a long silence. Maude said: 
‘‘Well, you go down and untie the son 
of a gun and get him up off the floor 
and tell him Maude’s on the phone and 
wants to speak to him.’’ 
So our constituents expect to talk 
with us when they want to. 
My first visit to the Senate was when 
I was a junior in high school. It was 
part of the American Legion Boys Na-
tion Program. I was invited to visit 
Senator Kefauver. I was 17 years old. I 
was reluctant to do that because I was 
sure he had many more important peo-
ple to see than a 17-year-old boy from 
Maryville, TN. I was even more sure of 
that when I arrived at his office be-
cause his office was just filled with 
people 
who 
looked 
important 
and 
looked like they had come from all 
over the world to see him. But his as-
sistant came out and swished me in 
through all the important people, 
doing her best to make me feel com-
fortable. Kefauver had a reputation for 
being accessible, and it was because his 
staff made it appear that he always 
was. 
I remind my staff that there are 
many people who want to see us who 
suspect that we feel we are too impor-
tant to see them, and we should do ev-
erything we can to help them under-
stand that we know that they are the 
important ones. 
The staff and I have done our best to 
try to do that. With all of the Senators 
with whom I have served from Ten-
nessee, we have what we call Tennessee 
Tuesday, which are breakfasts where 
any Tennessean can come and visit 
with both Senators, have a little 
breakfast, and have their photograph 
taken. 
In 18 years, 270 people have worked 
on my Senate staff—as I mentioned, in 
Jackson, Nashville, Tri-Cities, Knox-
ville, Memphis, Chattanooga, or in 
Washington, DC, on my personal staff 
or the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions staff or the Rules Committee 
or Appropriations Committee or at the 
Senate Republican conference. There 
are a lot of places to have a lot of 
staff—153 women, 117 men. 
Our staff has also benefited from the 
work of 433 interns. These interns usu-
ally stay with us 1 to 3 months, and 
they have some real work experiences 
while they are here, and they are pret-
ty good. In fact, 30 staff members—that 
is 11 percent of our staff—began their 
work in our office as interns. 
Our staff has experienced some great 
personal joys. We celebrated the birth 
or adoption of 30 babies over those 18 
years. Just as I met my wife Honey 
while we were both working in the Sen-
ate, some of our staffers met their 
spouses while working on my staff, in-
cluding: Mackensie Burt and Paul 
McKernana, Will Patterson and Kath-
erine Knight, Virginia Heppner and 
Bobby McMillin, Laura Lefler and John 
Herzog, Will Campbell and Victoria 
Souza, and Patrick Jaynes and Jill 
Salyers. They are all married now. 
We also have experienced some pro-
found sorrows. Some have lost parents, 
nursed seriously injured children, or 
been through their own health emer-
gencies. 
In November 2007, Trey Lefler, a very 
special staffer and friend, was involved 
in a serious car accident and died as a 
result of his injuries. 
Many staff members have stayed. We 
have worked together for a long time. 
Some have been a part of our team— 
meaning we worked together—since I 
became a Senator: Patrick Jaynes, 
State director; Lindsey Seidman, dep-
uty staff director on the HELP Com-
mittee; Jane Chedester, field represent-
ative in Knoxville; Kay Durham, con-
stituent 
services 
representative 
in 
Nashville; 
Charlotte 
Jackson, 
who 
knows more about how to help people 
with a visa problem than anybody in 
the world; Matt Varino, field represent-
ative in Jackson; Gina Parkerson in 
Tri-Cities; Stephanie Chivers, a senior 
adviser in Nashville. 
It is pretty remarkable. It is not so 
easy to be on the staff of a U.S. Sen-
ator in the State they represent. Ev-
erybody knows who you are. Every-
where you go, you are likely to be 
sought out by people who need help, 
people who are hurting. It is easy to 
get burned out. It is hard to stay in a 
job like that for that long. 
Patrick Jaynes says that while these 
might be jobs in politics, the politics 
end when you start the job. You have 
to work with everyone and help every-
one. 
Our Tennessee field representatives 
have 
traveled 
thousands 
of 
miles, 
meeting 
with 
mayors, 
businesses, 
schools, hospitals, and other organiza-
tions across our 95 counties. 
Caseworkers 
have 
handled 
about 
20,000 cases over the years, like getting 
disability benefits, helping a World 
War II veteran get a medal, helping a 
family stranded overseas get home. 
For example, Laura Ray Goodrich is 
a staffer in Jackson. She heard of a sin-
gle mother having desperate issues get-
ting her tax refund. The mother needed 
the money to help pay rent and the 
rest of her bills. Laura got to work and 
reached out to the IRS. She discovered 
the mother’s returns had been wrong 
for 
several 
years 
and 
helped 
the 
thrilled single mother recover far more 
money than she was expecting. 
Keith Abraham, who works in the 
Knoxville office, heard from a Ten-
nessee company about an employee 
with a grim cancer diagnosis. The em-
ployee’s parents lived in China. They 
were unable to see the employee be-
cause of COVID–19 restrictions. Long 
and short, Keith worked it out so they 
could receive the appropriate paper-
work and fly here to be with their 
daughter. 
One story that I got to see in person 
was about Wilbur ‘‘Bill’’ Hoffman from 
World War II. Mary Wooldridge, in our 
Memphis office, was asked if there was 
some way he could be recognized for 
his World War II service. She worked 
with the service and discovered that he 
was not only eligible for a Purple Heart 
after he had been wounded at Pointe du 
Hoc on D-Day in 1944, he had also 
earned the Bronze Star and the Ranger 
Tab awards. In 2012, he was presented 
with these awards by our State’s high-
est ranking military officer, General 
Haston at a ceremony I attended. He 
died a year later. 
Each fall, Kay Durham in our office 
works through about 150 Tennesseans’ 
applications to attend our Nation’s 
service academies. She has worked 
with over 2,500 candidates applying for 
those academies. 
There is no better State director 
than Patrick Jaynes. He also served as 
deputy chief of staff. He worked to cre-
ate a smooth relationship between 
what happens in Tennessee and what 
happens here. I have traveled thou-
sands of miles with Patrick. He has not 
run into anybody, but we have been 
through a lot of flat tires and some 
speeding tickets. Patrick and I have 
seen it all. He is full of insights. He al-
ways has energy for the next event and 
can always solve a problem. 
During my time in the Senate, the 
conference elected me three times as 
chairman of the Senate Republican 
conference. That is a little bit of a po-
litical job. What you are supposed to do 
is come up with something that Repub-
licans can say to counter what Demo-
crats are saying. It is especially a chal-
lenge to do that for Republicans to get 
them to talk on a single message. 
All of the Senators—every one of us— 
are experts in politics or we wouldn’t 
have gotten here. And Republican Sen-
ators are especially independent-mind-
ed. Republicans and Democrats will 
often all do things together as a cau-
cus, but we do it differently than they 
do. Democrats will all hold hands and 
jump off the cliff together. Republicans 
will also all jump off the cliff at the 
same time, but one will do a somer-
sault, one will do a back flip, one will 
do a dive, and so forth. 
The goal was to come up in the cau-
cus with a catchy phrase. For example, 
on energy, ‘‘Find more, use less,’’ or 
about ObamaCare, ‘‘step by step,’’ in-
stead of ‘‘comprehensive.’’ 
To persuade Senators to say the 
same thing, staff would record clips of 
them saying what I thought they 
should say, and then we would show 
that back to them at lunch. I found 
that Senators paid a lot more atten-
tion to watching themselves say things

than they did to watching me suggest 
to them what to say. 
It wasn’t me doing all that; it was 
staff doing it. They came up with 
catchy phrases, many of them. They 
made sure we communicated them at 
the conference. 
While I was on the Rules Committee, 
I had a chance—I worked with Senator 
SCHUMER on that. We were ranking— 
really, like this year, we didn’t know 
who would be the new President. I had 
an opportunity to speak at President 
Obama’s 
inauguration. 
We 
talked 
about the peaceful transfer or the reaf-
firmation of power as a conspicuous 
symbol of our democracy. There is no 
possible way to organize a Presidential 
inauguration without a superior staff. 
Mary Jones and Lindsey Seidman were 
the ones who were in charge of all that 
for us. 
Then, in 2012, on the Senate HELP 
Committee—as the senior Republican 
for 2 years, then 6 years as chairman— 
the staff grew a lot. Senator Ted Ken-
nedy used to say that the HELP Com-
mittee had about one-third of the juris-
diction of the Senate. It certainly does 
a lot of work, and it needs a lot of tal-
ented staff members. During my 8 
years as the senior Republican, the 
staff helped organize 209 hearings, 752 
witnesses, mostly bipartisan—meaning 
that I agreed with Senator Harkin 
first, then Senator MURRAY for the last 
6 years, on whom the witnesses would 
be. We produced 90 bills that have be-
come law. 
That is a lot of work—weeks of work 
by the staff. Securing each witness 
often takes a host of conversations 
with Democratic committee staff, nu-
merous phone calls with experts. 
Every bill that becomes law takes ef-
forts that are hard to comprehend out-
side the walls of Congress, from the 
consultations with constituents and 
experts to the drafting of the legisla-
tion, to the work with other members 
and outside groups, to consulting, to 
trying to soothe bruised feelings, to 
working with other committee mem-
bers, bring it to the attention of the 
majority leader, try to find an oppor-
tunity for it to be on the Senate cal-
endar, then bill support, then remove 
holes. There is a lot of work to do in 
passing a bill and making a law, and 
staff does most of the work. Senators 
do a lot, but they can’t do it all. 
Here are some of the achievements 
worth highlighting. I mentioned many 
of them yesterday in my farewell ad-
dress, so I won’t go into great detail 
about them today; for example, the 
Every Student Succeeds Act. This was 
the bill to fix No Child Left Behind. It 
affects 50 million children in 100,000 
schools. President Obama called it ‘‘a 
Christmas miracle.’’ The Wall Street 
Journal said it was the largest devolu-
tion of power from Washington to the 
States in 25 years. I will never forget 
what, to me, was a truly emotional mo-
ment, when every Senator on our com-
mittee—this is from RAND
PAUL
to 
ELIZABETH
WARREN—voted 
to 
rec-
ommend the bill to the Senate. This 
law was the result of complicated and 
nimble work by Peter Oppenheim, 
Lindsay Fryer, Matt Stern, and David 
Cleary. 
FAFSA Simplification. Twenty mil-
lion Americans fill out this ridicu-
lously complex form for Federal aid for 
Pell grants and student loans. You 
have seen me hold it up on the Senate 
floor. Everyone agrees it can be 33 in-
stead of 108 questions. Almost everyone 
agrees it is the major obstacle to low- 
income students getting Federal aid to 
go to college because they are intimi-
dated by it. Bob Moran, Lauren Davies, 
and Andrew LaCasse have worked hard 
with Senator MURRAY’s staff. We have 
it about half done. We would like to get 
it across the finish line before the end 
of the year. 
Head Start. In 2007, we came up with 
the idea. Sarah Rittling was the staff-
er. It was to establish 200 centers of ex-
cellence for the Head Start Program. 
Then, in 2005, Katrina came and Rita 
came, 
two 
big 
hurricanes. 
Kristin 
Bannerman was critical to legislation, 
where we worked with Senator Ken-
nedy, Senator Dodd, and Senator Lan-
drieu for voucher funding to assist with 
the cost of educating 150,000 public and 
nonpublic school students in grades K– 
12 displaced by the hurricane. 
Then, reauthorizing the Perkins Ca-
reer and Technical Education Act. Edu-
cation Week said it was ‘‘a watershed 
moment.’’ Staffer Jake Baker worked 
on that. Senator ENZI did a lot of the 
heavy work. 
I have been fortunate to have two ex-
traordinary women whom I work with 
on the team of staff on the HELP Com-
mittee who handle family health pol-
icy: Mary-Sumpter Lapinski and Grace 
Graham. 
Before they started, Melissa Pfaff, 
Page Kranbuhl, and Marguerite Salee 
Kondracke were instrumental in pass-
ing the PREEMIE Act in 2003, getting 
the bill well written and signed into 
law, working with the March of Dimes 
to help give more babies a chance to 
live long and healthy lives. 
Once I became senior on the HELP 
Committee, we began to work on the 
21st 
Century 
Cures 
Act. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL said it was the most impor-
tant law of that Congress. It helps 
speed medical innovations to patients 
in doctors’ offices. Margaret Coulter, 
Andy Vogt, Melissa Pfaff, Brett Meeks, 
and others spent countless hours get-
ting ready for that. 
FDA user fees. This showed Grace 
Graham’s ability to be a traffic cop 
working with Senator MURRAY’s staff 
and with House committees. We had a 
really fairly seamless effort to take 
these complicated pieces of law to col-
lect user fees from drug and device 
makers and include significant new 
provisions to speed those drugs and de-
vices into doctors’ offices. 
The most popular bill that never be-
came a law was called Alexander-Mur-
ray. I even bought a case of Scotch 
called Alexander-Murray to give out to 
everybody when it passed, but it never 
was passed. The result of the immense 
efforts—the whole goal—was to reduce 
the cost of healthcare premiums in the 
individual insurance market. President 
Trump worked well with us on that. 
Virginia McMillin and Liz Wroe did 
countless 
hours 
of 
work, 
but 
we 
couldn’t quite get it across the finish 
line. 
Then, this year, there was the shark 
tank. With the support of Senators 
BLUNT and SHELBY, we worked together 
with Francis Collins, of the National 
Institutes of Health, to create an ini-
tiative of $2.5 billion to produce 50 mil-
lion more COVID diagnostic tests a 
month than current technologies would 
do. Grace Graham, Melissa Pfaff, and 
Laura Friedel on Senator BLUNT’s staff 
worked on that. 
During all of this, Grace Graham was 
in her third trimester—not during all 
of it. During the latter part of this, she 
was in her third trimester. She was 
working on design policies and being a 
traffic cop between here and the House. 
To date, she and Stash, her husband, 
have had their first child, Penn. She is 
back at work, and the country is better 
off for everything that she has contrib-
uted. 
Our committee leadership positions 
are often considered the plum posi-
tions, but you can do a whole lot with 
a talented personal staff. Ours has put 
in long hours and has met expecta-
tions. For example, on the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, Anna Newton and 
Lindsay Garcia did yeoman’s work. 
This is a bill that good people have lit-
erally been trying to pass since the Ei-
senhower years. It was the most impor-
tant piece of outdoor legislation in 
that period of time. 
With the Music Modernization Act, 
we worked with Senator Hatch and his 
staff. We eventually got 85 cosponsors, 
but this one nearly ran off the road 
several times. Lindsay Garcia and Paul 
McKernan made sure it became law. 
The America COMPETES Act was 
back in my early years as a Senator, 
when I was very junior, so I got the Re-
publican leader and the Democratic 
leader to cosponsor it. It passed with, I 
think, more than 60 cosponsors to im-
prove our competitive position in the 
world. 
Matt Sonnesyn and David Cleary 
were the key staffers on that. They 
were not just working with staff people 
around here. For example, with the 
America COMPETES Act, the bill 
wouldn’t have passed if it had not been 
for 800 outdoor recreation environ-
mental groups outside of Congress who 
supported the bill and encouraged Sen-
ators to get off planes and come back 
here to cast crucial votes. We are 
grateful 
for 
that. 
Matt 
Sonnesyn 
worked with the Iraq Study Group rec-
ommendations that we made during 
the George W. Bush years, and Erin 
Reif and Lucas DaPieve have been ex-
perts on foreign affairs and appropria-
tions. 
While I have been chairman of the 
Energy and Water Appropriations, we

have had 5 straight years in a row— 
hopefully, we will have 6—of funding 
the Office of Science, which supports 
our 17 National Laboratories. We have 
also stepped up funding for all of the 
inland waterways, like Chickamauga 
Lock, and for supercomputing in order 
to keep us first in the world. Tom 
Craig, Tyler Owens, Meyer Seligman, 
Jen Armstrong, and Adam DeMella all 
played key roles in that. 
I met every week with what I called 
my Energy Working Group. I found the 
intersection of energy and environment 
to be, really, the most fascinating new 
subject for me during my time as a 
Senator, and we did a lot of work on 
that both on the Committee on Appro-
priations and with other Senators. 
Meeting with that energy policy staff 
helped to get the America COMPETES 
Act passed. It stopped the Road to No-
where in the Smokies. It pushed back 
on the efforts to promote Big Wind on 
our mountain ridges, and it resulted in 
record funding for energy and water de-
velopment. 
Sharon 
Segner, 
Jessica 
Holliday, Conrad Schatte, and Lindsay 
Garcia all led those teams. 
We spend a lot of time working with 
staff to get the policy right and trying 
to get the message right. You have to 
be able to persuade at least half the 
people that you are right in this busi-
ness. Words matter. We spend a lot of 
time on headlines so that we convey 
what we are trying to do. The individ-
uals who have led our communications 
unit include Alexia Poe, Harvey Valen-
tine, Lee Pitts, Jim Jeffries, Brian 
Reisinger, 
Margaret 
Atkinson, 
Liz 
Wolgemuth, Ashton Davies, and Taylor 
Haulsee. 
You can’t run an effective office 
without a good office manager. We 
have had the best—Trina Tyrer and 
Debbie Paul. Misty Marshall came to 
us from the White House, where she 
was the director of correspondence for 
Laura Bush. 
One of the toughest, most important 
jobs in the Senate office that people 
outside the Senate don’t really appre-
ciate as much is the job of scheduling. 
It requires constant changes, great dis-
cretion, enormous promptness, and at-
tention to detail. Every day is a mis-
match of meetings and calls. There is 
no schedule, really, in the U.S. Senate. 
You just kind of keep up with what is 
going on, and you put it down on a 
piece of paper. Suddenly, everything 
can get wiped out by an emergency 
call. Bonnie Sansonetti, Sarah Fair-
child, and Alicyn York have been the 
very best. 
The legislative director conducts the 
office orchestra. I have been very fortu-
nate that Allison Martin has been our 
conductor. She used to work for Bill 
Frist and Fred Thompson. She is a 
West Tennessean, but the whole State 
is what she cares about as well as the 
country. If you were to look for some-
body with her skill and talent, you 
would be looking for a very long time. 
David Cleary, Richard Hertling, Matt 
Sonnesyn, and David Morgenstern were 
also legislative directors. 
One thing I know is I wouldn’t be 
very good as a chief of staff, so I needed 
a very good chief of staff to do some 
things that I don’t do as well. My first 
one was Tommy Ingram, whom I have 
known since 1966 when he was a Ten-
nessean reporter, and I was working for 
Howard Baker in his second campaign. 
We have been friends ever since. He was 
my campaign manager and chief of 
staff as Governor. He did the same 
thing. He is really responsible for much 
of my success in politics. 
David Morgenstern joined my staff in 
2005 as legislative director, and he be-
came chief of staff in 2009. 
Matt Sonnesyn came to me from the 
Harvard Kennedy School of Govern-
ment. He was initially a senior policy 
adviser. He was one of the few Repub-
lican students in the Harvard Kennedy 
School of Government, so he was well 
trained in defending his views. 
Ryan Loskarn served as chief of staff 
starting in 2007. 
Then, in my personal office, David 
Cleary has been the chief for the past 7 
years. You can see him somewhere in 
an outrageous red and black suit on 
the Senate floor. David and I have 
worked together for almost 15 years. 
First, he served as staff director for the 
HELP Subcommittee on Children and 
Families. He used to work for John 
Boehner in the House. 
In 2014, after becoming the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
HELP 
Committee, 
David suggested, as I said earlier, that 
he be both chief of staff and staff direc-
tor of the committee. I recounted how, 
at first, I thought that was a bad idea, 
but it was one of the best ideas sug-
gested to me because it made our staff 
so much more effective and work so 
much better. It was the key to our suc-
cess, really, and I do not know of a 
more effective chief of staff of the Sen-
ate than David Cleary. He led our ef-
forts to fix No Child Left Behind, the 
21st Century Cures, the reauthorizing 
of Perkins, and the FDA user fees legis-
lation. I appreciate how much time 
Marci, his wife, and Maria, their 
daughter, have given to our team. 
To close, I would like to thank all 270 
staff members who have given time and 
energy to our office. One of those, Rey-
nard Graham, has been my administra-
tive right hand for many years. His 
bigger job is that he is a minister on 
the weekends. There isn’t time to rec-
ognize the accomplishments of each 
one by name, but there are many, and 
I am grateful to every single indi-
vidual. 
It has been a tremendous gift to work 
with a skilled and dedicated staff. Each 
person who has served in this office 
should be proud of what we have ac-
complished. I have been so fortunate to 
have been on the same team with each 
of you for the last 18 years. 
In a farewell address yesterday, I said 
that I wake up every day thinking I 
might be able to do something good for 
our country and that I go to bed most 
nights thinking that I have. It has been 
a great privilege to be a U.S. Senator. 
It has been a great privilege over these 
18 years to work with such an excep-
tional staff. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD a list of the 
names of my staff.

rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
first, let me join with so many of my 
colleagues in wishing our distinguished 
friend and Senator from Tennessee best 
wishes. 
Thank you, Senator ALEXANDER, for 
your incredible leadership and working 
across the aisle. So many good things 
that you have talked about are so 
meaningful to all of us. I appreciate 
the way you have conducted yourself 
with the committees and with Mem-
bers, and I have enjoyed the oppor-
tunity to work with you. Electric vehi-
cles didn’t quite get across the line this 
year with what we wanted to do in 
terms of tax cuts, but I appreciate the 
chance to have been able to partner 
with you. Certainly, I wish you the 
best in your next steps in work as you 
end the year with your family. In 
whatever you do, I know you will be 
very successful. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
it might be hard to believe it is actu-
ally December. In normal times, a lot 
of families in Michigan would be fo-
cused on getting ready for the holi-
days, and while Michigan children 
might still be counting down the days 
until Santa arrives, their parents have 
a lot bigger issues weighing on their 
minds. 
A Michigan dad has been out of work 
for months and is wondering how long 
his family will be able to keep scraping 
by in the new year after his unemploy-
ment runs out. 
A Michigan single mom whose hours 
have been cut and who has been unable 
to pay the rent for months is won-
dering just how long it will be until her 
family will be out on the street. 
The owner of a Michigan small busi-
ness is wondering if he will see enough 
of a holiday boost to keep the doors 
open and his three employees on the 
payroll. 
A Michigan retiree who struggles to 
buy enough groceries is wondering if it 
is safe to wait in a long line at her 
local food bank or if that is where she 
will get sick. 
Michigan families who have seen al-
most 9,300 of their grandparents and 
neighbors and uncles and cousins and 
friends and community leaders get sick 
and die from this horrible virus are 
wondering who is going to be next. 
The truth is that we are not just fac-
ing a health crisis right now—we are 
facing an economic crisis; we are fac-
ing a housing crisis; and we are facing 
a hunger crisis all at the same time. 
Coronavirus 
cases, 
hospitalizations, 
and deaths keep rising, and we haven’t 
even seen the effects of Thanksgiving 
gatherings yet. We are seeing unem-
ployment claims tick up, and those are 
expected to get worse after seasonal 
jobs will be cut in January. 
Some studies have estimated that 
about 40 million renters in the United 
States are at risk of losing their 
homes. There are already 10,000 evic-
tion actions that have been filed in a 
number of States. Those are 10,000 fam-
ilies who need to find new places to live 
right now, in the winter, in the middle 
of a health pandemic. 
We have all seen the massive lines of 
cars at food banks across the country. 
In a normal year, the Food Bank of 
Eastern Michigan helps about 14 per-
cent of the population in 22 counties 
get enough food to eat. This year, it is 
helping 40 percent to put food on the 
table. Before COVID–19, the South 
Michigan Food Bank provided food to 
about 80 families a week. Now it is 
helping more than 500 families a week. 
This is an emergency. These families, 
businesses, community organizations, 
and seniors can’t just wait around, hop-
ing for a Christmas miracle. They need 
help now, and it is our responsibility to 
do it now. 
That is why I am so pleased that law-
makers on both sides of the aisle have 
been working to come together on ad-
ditional help. There are still a lot of 
details to work out, but I am hopeful, 
in being part of the process on the 
workings of the details, that we are 
going to be able to come together on an 
agreement that will help families and 
businesses 
and 
communities 
get 
through these tough times. 
Whatever agreement we reach won’t 
be perfect. We know that. It won’t be 
everything everybody wants. Yet we 
can’t wait because time is quickly run-
ning out. On December 26—only 23 days 
from now—vital unemployment pro-
grams will expire, cutting off benefits 
that millions of workers will need to be 
able to provide for their families. 
If you are self-employed, if you are a 
contract worker, if you are a gig work-
er, suddenly you will have zero help— 
zero. 
Five days after that, on December 31, 
the Federal Reserve’s emergency lend-
ing program ends. That will cut off cru-
cial credit that is keeping businesses 
open and helping State and local gov-
ernments provide necessary services. 
Also on December 31, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s evic-
tion moratorium expires, and the Fed-
eral foreclosure moratorium and some 
opportunities for forbearance expire. 
Imagine what it would be like to 
begin a new year with no roof over 
your head or your family’s, no place for 
your children to sleep, and no place to 
stay clean in the middle of a raging 
pandemic. 
And on January 1, millions of student 
loan borrowers will have to resume 
their payments whether they can af-
ford them or not. 
These programs have been, literally, 
a lifeline for families, for communities, 
for businesses during the pandemic. 
And while vaccines are on the horizon 
and we are so happy to hear the 
progress, this pandemic is far from 
over. Cutting off this vital help now 
would be like an ambulance driver 
stopping 2 miles short of the hospital 
and making the accident victim get 
out and walk the rest of the way to the 
emergency room. 
We need to face this health crisis, 
this economic crisis, this housing cri-
sis, this hunger crisis with seriousness 
and boldness. People in Michigan and 
across the country are crying out for 
help. It is time for this body to listen. 
It is time for Congress to lead. 
We should not go home until we have 
passed at least a short-term survival 
package to help Americans through the 
next few months. That is our job. That 
is our job, and we should not go home 
until that job is done. 
We are the United States of Amer-
ica—United States of America. Nothing 
is holding us back from helping our 
citizens other than people’s unwilling-
ness to do it. Nothing. 
We are the United States of America. 
There is no reason we are not coming 
together, and shame on the Congress 
and the White House if we don’t act 
now to help our citizens. 
There is nothing holding us back but 
the political will to do it, and it needs 
to get done. There are many of us now 
on both sides of the aisle working to do 
that, and we need to make sure that 
people lean in together and get this 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
West Virginia. 
f 
REMEMBERING OFFICER CASSIE 
JOHNSON 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk of one of West Virginia’s 
very own—Police Officer Cassie John-
son. 
Officer Johnson was a member of her 
hometown of Charleston’s police de-
partment, where she joined less than 2 
short years ago. 
She was a devoted daughter, sister, a 
loyal friend, and a lover of animals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7204 
December 3, 2020 
She had three dogs. She was formerly a 
humane officer, as well, in our commu-
nity. And, boy, did she have a bright 
future ahead of her. 
On Tuesday, the Charleston Police 
Department received a call about a 
traffic complaint. Officer Johnson an-
swered that call and responded accord-
ingly, just as she would have any other 
call. 
Shortly after arriving at that loca-
tion, she was shot in the chest. The 
bullet hit her badge and deflected into 
her neck, where it eventually struck a 
main artery. 
She was rushed to the hospital, and 
every effort was made to save her life. 
She was 28. She was 28 years old. 
Sadly, we learned yesterday that the 
decision was made to remove her from 
life support, and she will not be able to 
pull through. 
We also learned that Officer Johnson 
is an organ donor, which means she 
will be able to share the gift of life 
with others. 
I had the opportunity to speak with 
Officer Johnson’s mother Sheryl just 
this morning, and she expressed to me 
her daughter’s commitment to organ 
donation. She said that her daughter 
felt very strongly about giving this gift 
to others in the event that something 
like this could happen. She was very 
clear about her wishes, and I think 
that is a testament to the kind of per-
son Officer Johnson was. 
As former Charleston Police Depart-
ment Lieutenant Paul Perdue said, 
‘‘The end of her life will be the second 
beginning for others and that’s just 
who she was.’’ 
As you can imagine, our community 
is hurting, and all of our law enforce-
ment across the country is hurting 
today for our community and Officer 
Johnson’s family. 
But the outpour of support has just 
been incredible to witness. Throughout 
this week, West Virginians have been 
honoring Officer Johnson’s life in so 
many ways, such as in Charleston, 
where our beautiful coliseum and civic 
center has been lit in blue in honor of 
her and our law enforcement. 
There has been a great money-raising 
effort to help Officer Johnson’s family 
meet what is going to be a financial 
challenge. And what do we do with her 
pets? There has been an effort to have 
her pets adopted. I just read before I 
came in here that the GoFundMe page 
for Officer Johnson had already exceed-
ed its goal, and, hopefully, it will con-
tinue to grow. 
Last night a candle vigil was held 
outdoors to honor her life and legacy, 
where the community leaders spoke 
and Officer Johnson’s mother Sheryl 
spoke. It is a tough duty, a tough as-
signment for any mom. 
During the vigil, her mother spoke 
about Officer Johnson’s love for her 
community, about her desire to protect 
everyone she was surrounded by. 
You know, when I talked to her 
mother this morning, she echoed those 
same sentiments in the phone con-
versation that we had, and she said 
that hundreds of West Virginians had 
reached out to her personally. Many 
had stopped by the hospital, wanting to 
say goodbye to Officer Johnson. These 
gestures have just been so touching, 
and I could tell it really helped her 
family and, in particular, her mother 
Sheryl. 
Charleston Police Chief Tyke Hunt 
told Officer Johnson’s mother that she 
raised her right, and that Officer John-
son was ‘‘a good-hearted soul who had 
to pay the ultimate sacrifice.’’ 
Chief Hunt is right. It is a bitter pill. 
In a local interview following her 
swearing-in, Officer Johnson said: ‘‘I 
am really happy to finally getting to 
follow my dreams in working with 
Charleston PD.’’ 
She continued by saying: ‘‘I’ve grown 
up and lived in Charleston my whole 
life. I just wanted to help make my 
city a better place—and be there and to 
be able to help the citizens of this 
city.’’ 
This job was a dream come true for 
Officer Johnson. She loved her commu-
nity, and our community loved her 
back. Like all of our law enforcement, 
Officer Johnson cared for us and was 
fiercely dedicated to protecting her 
community—and that is my commu-
nity. When I think of Officer Johnson, 
I think of her protecting my family 
and my neighbors, my community, the 
larger community of Charleston. 
Police officers like Officer Johnson 
selflessly put their lives on the line 
every day for the safety of our commu-
nities. They never know what is around 
the corner. They never know. She 
thought she was going for a parking 
violation. It is a hard job and one that 
is rarely appreciated enough. 
I ask—if you have heard this today or 
if you have read about this—that we all 
take a minute today and every day to 
thank our law enforcement and recog-
nize the sacrifices that they make to 
ensure that our communities are safe 
and protected. 
I would also ask you to keep the 
Johnson family in your hearts and 
prayers—our chief, Chief Hunt of the 
Charleston Police Department, and all 
of her brothers and sisters in the police 
department and the first responders. 
Our mayor, Mayor Amy Goodwin, has 
done a wonderful job of bringing the 
community together and showing a 
wonderful show of support for Officer 
Cassie Johnson and her family, and I 
thank her. 
The entire city of Charleston is hurt-
ing, so please keep them in your hearts 
and prayers as well. 
With that very difficult time, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the leg-
islative year is quickly drawing to a 
close, but the lights on the 116th Con-
gress haven’t gone out yet. Before the 
House and the Senate gavel out for the 
final time this Congress, we still have 
a lot of work to do. 
Headlines have focused on the large, 
‘‘must-pass’’ legislation, which will re-
quire a good amount of debate and 
compromise 
in 
the 
coming 
days— 
things like government funding, the 
National Defense Authorization bill, 
and another COVID–19 relief package. 
But there are actually countless other 
bills that have already passed the Sen-
ate with broad bipartisan support and 
continue to linger in purgatory on the 
House’s legislative calendar. 
After weeks, months, and, in some 
cases, more than a year of waiting, the 
Speaker and the House leadership 
refuse to let these commonsense bipar-
tisan bills have a vote on the House 
floor. Just to give you an idea of the 
type of legislation they are holding up, 
let’s start with the Jenna Quinn Law. 
This legislation carries the name of an 
inspiring young Texan who is a sur-
vivor of child sexual abuse and who has 
made it her mission in life to end the 
cycle of abuse that harms our children 
in communities across the country. 
Jenna was the driving force behind a 
2009 Texas law requiring training for 
teachers, caregivers, and other adults 
who work with children on how to pre-
vent, recognize, and report child sexual 
abuse. You can imagine the teachers, 
in particular, who spend—at least be-
fore COVID—day after day after day 
with children. They are actually in the 
best position, sometimes, to identify 
symptoms of sexual abuse, if properly 
trained. 
Since 2009, a number of other States 
have passed similar laws, but the train-
ing often lacks adequate funding, and 
that is where our Federal legislation 
comes in. I introduced this bipartisan 
bill with Senator HASSAN from New 
Hampshire to finally back that train-
ing 
with 
Federal 
funding 
through 
grants from the Department of Health 
and Human Services. At a time when 
the experts believe that abuse is on the 
rise as families are isolated at home 
due to COVID–19 mitigation efforts, 
this legislation could not be more ur-
gent. 
Despite the fact that this bill will de-
liver real change for the most vulner-
able in our communities and that it 
passed the Senate with unanimous sup-
port, the House refuses to even vote on 
it. House Democrats have chosen to 
hold this lifesaving legislation hostage 
in order to advance a partisan bill that 
they know has no chance of becoming 
law. 
Unfortunately, those are the types of 
games that, sadly, we have had to be-
come accustomed to when it comes to 
House Democrats. But, as I said, this is 
only one of a long list of bills that they 
are sitting on. 
Over the summer, the Senate passed 
legislation that had taken aim at an-
other crisis harming our children, 
which is e-cigarettes. Prior to COVID– 
19, headlines were dominated by stories

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7205 
December 3, 2020 
about mysterious vaping-related ill-
nesses and healthy teenagers being ad-
mitted to emergency rooms with symp-
toms usually associated only with dec-
ades-long smokers. 
Well, to state the obvious, the most 
effective way to prevent children from 
becoming addicted to these devices is 
to stop them from getting their hands 
on them in the first place. If the 16- 
year-old went to a gas station or con-
venience store and attempted to buy an 
e-cigarette, they would be turned away 
because that sale could not take place 
without a proper ID, but those same 
age-verification 
requirements 
don’t 
apply to online purchases. Devices can 
be ordered and delivered without any 
proof of age or an ID. 
Senator FEINSTEIN, the senior Sen-
ator from California, and I introduced 
legislation to change that and ensure 
that online purchases are subject to 
the same age verification requirements 
as those made in person. Once again, 
this legislation passed the Senate 
unanimously, but the House has re-
fused to take any action. 
And here is another one. Last month, 
we passed a bill to provide mental 
healthcare to those transitioning out 
of the criminal justice system. More 
than half of the individuals in the 
criminal justice system have experi-
enced a mental health issue, and our 
justice system too often fails to pro-
vided adequate diagnosis and treat-
ment. 
But even when these individuals do 
receive treatment while incarcerated, 
they are rarely given the tools they 
need to succeed upon release. Approxi-
mately 80 percent of the people are un-
insured after being released, making it 
nearly impossible for them to continue 
mental health treatment without addi-
tional safety net provisions. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL, our colleague 
from Connecticut, and I introduced leg-
islation to support those who have be-
come part of our criminal justice sys-
tem who have decided to turn their 
lives around and to provide them stable 
treatment if they suffer from a mental 
illness as they transition out of incar-
ceration. That is not only in their best 
interest, but it is in the best interest of 
the larger community, because these 
people, rather than being a danger to 
the community, can contribute to the 
community. 
This legislation passed the Senate 
with unanimous support, but, once 
again, no movement in the House, and 
the list goes on and on and on. 
We unanimously approved legislation 
to provide justice to families of human 
smuggling victims and assistance to 
local communities battling the prob-
lem, to help State and local govern-
ments strengthen their cyber security 
and safeguard their elections, and to 
increase cross-border economic and 
educational partnerships with Mexico. 
Those half dozen bills I just named 
are only a handful of the ones I intro-
duced that have passed the Senate but 
are collecting dust on the House cal-
endar. Add in the long list of bills led 
by our Republican and Democratic col-
leagues, and we have a major legisla-
tive logjam in the House. 
As I understand it, next week is set 
to be the House’s last workweek of the 
116th Congress. That means that, un-
less Speaker PELOSI and House Demo-
cratic leadership allow movement on 
these compromise, commonsense bipar-
tisan bills, we are going to have to 
start from square one. We are going to 
have to start all over again in the next 
Congress. 
Now, I know it is not unusual for a 
Member of Congress to take legislative 
hostages to advance their own agenda, 
but this is not a time to play those 
kinds of politics, particularly on these 
kinds of subjects. These aren’t con-
troversial bills. We are talking about 
grants to prevent child sexual abuse, 
reform to stop kids from buying e-ciga-
rettes online, a lifeline of hope for 
folks who suffer from mental illness 
and are transitioning from our crimi-
nal justice system, and so much more. 
As I said, these bills are just one step 
away from heading to the President’s 
desk for his signature, so it is time for 
Speaker PELOSI and the leadership of 
the House to quit playing games and 
allow the House to vote on these life- 
changing bills. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ENZI 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, we know we have a lot of 
lawyers in Congress, and we have some 
former businessmen. We even have peo-
ple who are lawyers and businessmen 
who serve in our midst. They are doc-
tors, educators. We have a few farmers. 
But we have only two accountants, to 
my knowledge, one of whom is our 
friend MIKE ENZI. 
For those of us who have long fought 
to rein in spending and to get our na-
tional debt in check, MIKE’s contribu-
tion to those efforts has been invalu-
able. But that is only part of the rea-
son we are sad to say farewell to such 
an incredible colleague. 
Long before Senator ENZI’s career in 
politics or even accounting, he joined 
the family shoe business, cleverly 
named ‘‘NZ Shoes’’—that is capital 
‘‘N,’’ capital ‘‘Z,’’ Shoes. It wasn’t long 
before our friend MIKE, at the young 
age of 30, was lured into a life of public 
service and elected mayor of Gillette, 
WY. His career would lead him to the 
Department of the Interior, the Wyo-
ming State House and Senate, and 
eventually here to the U.S. Senate. But 
Senator ENZI still holds on to the les-
sons he learned in those early days 
selling shoes. 
A few years ago, he said: 
Legislating is like selling shoes. You have 
to know your market, what they want, and 
who’s willing to buy what you’re [selling]. 
Well, I don’t know how effective 
MIKE was as a shoe salesman, but I can 
tell you that he has been a master 
broker here in the Senate. I still re-
member when I came to the Senate, 
the liberal lion of the Senate, Ted Ken-
nedy, was serving with MIKE ENZI on 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. They were enor-
mously productive—one of the most 
conservative Members and one of the 
most liberal Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate. So I asked MIKE, our friend Sen-
ator ENZI: How do you do it? 
He said: It is simple. It is the 80–20 
rule. You take the 80 percent that you 
can agree on, the common ground, and 
you get it done, and you leave the 20 
percent that you can’t agree on to an-
other day and another fight. 
That is the kind of common sense we 
need more of here in the U.S. Senate 
when it comes to solving our Nation’s 
problems. 
When there are big debates on policy 
or high-stakes negotiations, Senator 
ENZI is not one to share his opinions 
with reporters in the hallways or, 
thankfully, to air his grievances on na-
tional television, but he does work be-
hind the scenes, settling disagreements 
with private phone calls and meetings 
rather than fiery speeches and press re-
leases. 
There is no question he has had to 
settle a lot of disagreements during his 
24 years in the Senate, especially, as I 
said, during his time on the HELP 
Committee and as chairman of the 
Budget Committee. We have 100 indi-
viduals in the Senate from all across 
this big and diverse Nation of ours who 
have very different ideas about what 
should be done and opinions on how to 
get it done, but part of what makes 
him so successful is settling those dif-
ferences—look past the areas where we 
disagree, and look at common ground. 
Besides the 80–20 rule that has for-
ever stuck in my mind as a great for-
mula for solving problems and getting 
things done, MIKE has a great attitude 
about life—one that I find very positive 
and inspiring, even. He says: ‘‘You have 
to have an attitude of gratitude.’’ 
That is another thing I will remem-
ber about MIKE ENZI—always grateful 
for his ability to serve his fellow Wyo-
ming citizens, for his family, his won-
derful family, and for this great coun-
try that we live in. I know he is eager 
to spend more time enjoying the great 
outdoors. MIKE has said he wants to ac-
tually go fishing in all 50 States. I 
don’t know how many States he has 
not yet fished in, but after he leaves 
the U.S. Senate, hopefully he will ac-
complish his goal of going fishing in all 
50 States of the Union. 
We will miss him here in the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS VACCINE 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the Pre-
siding Officer and I are here, and we 
have been meeting today in Wash-
ington at, really, a groundbreaking 
moment as we continue this battle for 
our health, for our economy, and 
against the virus. What makes this 
such a critical moment are the devel-
opments we have seen in the last 10 
days regarding a vaccine. 
Public health experts around the 
world have agreed, almost from day 
one, that the way to really find the end 
of this pandemic—the ultimate weap-
on—would be to develop a vaccine that 
worked. Less than a year ago, which 
was in January and February of this 
year, we were hearing that 2 years 
would set a record for developing a vac-
cine and that sometimes a vaccine that 
has been developed on a new disease 
like this has taken 3 and 5 and even 10 
years or more. Yet here we are, less a 
year from the discovery of COVID–19, 
with not just one vaccine but two vac-
cines that have already applied for 
their use permits. Both vaccines have 
shown an effectiveness of more than 90 
percent, and a third vaccine with a 
similar response is about to get to the 
place at which it, too, can apply for 
use. 
These are incredible numbers. It 
wasn’t that many months ago that 
healthcare experts were saying, if we 
get a vaccine that is effective 50 per-
cent of the time or more, that the gov-
ernment 
should 
consider 
accepting 
that vaccine and making it available to 
people, and here we are with a 90 per-
cent effective vaccine. I had the mea-
sles, and my kids had the measles shot, 
which seemed to pretty much elimi-
nate the measles. It was 90 percent ef-
fective. This is the kind of vaccine that 
has been the most effective among the 
most effective vaccines we have ever 
had. 
Pfizer and Moderna have both come 
forward and asked for their emergency 
use authorizations. The emergency use 
doesn’t really mean they have cut any 
corners. The only thing we have failed 
to do is to watch the 30,000 or so people 
for another 2 or 3 years who were in 
both of these trials. That is why we 
can’t say with certainty if this vaccine 
will last for a lifetime or if this vaccine 
will be a 3-year vaccine or even a 1- 
year vaccine. What we can say with 
certainty is that, about 95 percent of 
the time, it will prevent you from get-
ting the disease. Of course, if people 
are prevented from getting the disease, 
they can’t spread the disease, and that 
is why a 90 percent effective vaccine, 
like the measles vaccine, was basically 
100 percent effective as long as people 
took it. 
So we need to step back, really, I 
think, and look at the unconventional 
way we got here. How did we get from 
3 to 5 to, maybe, 10 years to less than 
a year of discovering a virus for the 
very first time to our having a vaccine? 
The way that researchers have been 
able to move forward with this and the 
way that Congress and the Trump ad-
ministration have responded to this 
pandemic has been extraordinary. In 
our country, Operation Warp Speed has 
accelerated the development of this 
new vaccine through a fast-track proc-
ess that could be described, really, in 
one word—unprecedented. Normally, 
vaccines take years. Researchers have 
to go out and secure funding, get ap-
provals, and study results step by step 
to get to where we are today. Only then 
would a vaccine be determined to be 
safe and effective, and only then would 
manufacturing begin. 
Normally, with a vaccine, the day 
the vaccine is approved is the day you 
start manufacturing. We know that 
this is not what is happening here. In 
fact, in just a few minutes, I am going 
to mention that the head of distribu-
tion is saying, on the day the vaccine 
is approved, we will start shipping mil-
lions of copies of that vaccine all over 
the country. 
This 
all 
really 
started 
with 
Congress’s deciding, as we put these 
COVID relief packages together from 
the very first couple of packages, that 
when it came to a cure, we were not 
going to let funding stand in the way 
nor were we going to let it stand in the 
way of investing some money some-
where that just simply didn’t work be-
cause, by investing money where it 
didn’t work, it allowed us to invest 
money where it did work. Congress ap-
propriated $18 billion for vaccines and 
testing. About $12.5 billion has gone 
into the vaccine side. Most of the rest 
has gone into testing, with some going 
into therapy. This is a decision Con-
gress made. With this vaccine, we are 
going to become partners in developing 
how we fight back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7207 
December 3, 2020 
There was a risk that some of the 
vaccine 
candidates 
we 
supported 
wouldn’t make it, but there was never 
a risk that the vaccine candidates that 
did make it wouldn’t be as safe as any 
vaccine has ever been. In fact, many of 
these vaccines have had more people 
involved in the studies than ever be-
fore. Because of the virulence of the 
virus, the people in the studies, frank-
ly, were more likely than not to be ex-
posed to COVID, and a bunch of them 
were more likely than not to catch it. 
Of course, that is the moment when 
you decide if the group that caught the 
virus was the group that had the 
virus—the group that had the vaccine 
in these studies—or if it were the group 
that didn’t have the vaccine. What we 
found out was, 95 percent of the time, 
it was the group that didn’t have the 
vaccine, which is where you get that 95 
percent number. 
Congress provided that we would 
take some risk. We so often hear that 
failure is not an option. In this case, if 
you didn’t fail, you were not trying 
hard enough. If all you wind up with 
are things that have gotten approved, 
then you probably have left some 
things on the table that you should 
have tried. 
The Presiding Officer is a great busi-
nessman, and he knows, if you are in a 
business that is growing, you are going 
to have some failures. If you have 
never had failures in your business, 
you have not tried anything new, 
which means you probably haven’t 
grown. So we would have failures not 
in a vaccine that we would give to peo-
ple but by thinking: This would appear 
like it would have a good chance of 
being approved, so let’s put it in the 
group of vaccines that we are working 
on. 
President Trump and Operation Warp 
Speed stepped up and decided they were 
going to move at a faster pace than 
ever before but with more safety than 
we have had in most vaccine develop-
ments in the history of the country. So 
we decided to support several vaccines 
that, again, we thought had a better 
chance of being approved than not. 
Now, you take some risk in that be-
cause all of the vaccines won’t be ap-
proved, but you take no risk if you are 
going to support a vaccine that is ap-
proved but that is not safe. Yet that is 
not what happened at all. You just put 
a lot of racehorses in the race. 
The dean of the National School of 
Tropical Medicine at Baylor University 
says, if you are racing to get a vaccine 
quickly, one way to do it is to put as 
many horses in the race as you can, 
and that is exactly what we have done. 
We have invested in several potential 
vaccines and, I think, three different 
paths to a vaccine, which means that 
all of the vaccines that are approved 
will not be exactly the same in how 
you have to store them, in how you 
have to transport them, and whether 
you have to have one shot or two to 
have the full vaccine. 
And we have signed contracts with 
six leading candidates already. We 
have invested $2.5 billion to help de-
velop and purchase 100 million doses of 
the 
vaccine 
being 
developed 
by 
Moderna. That was jointly developed 
by the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases and the com-
pany. 
We have dedicated $2 billion in a dif-
ferent pattern to purchase 100 million 
doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and we 
have done that with that investment in 
a way that allows us to shorten the 
processing time, combining various 
study phases and clinical trials going 
on at the same time and moving for-
ward in a way that also allowed us to 
be manufacturing vaccines while we 
were still studying and moving toward 
final approval by the FDA. 
So we have two vaccines standing 
and ready now for final approval, an-
other one to join them soon, and an-
other one to join them quickly after 
that. But all of them are already in the 
stage of manufacturing. 
So what is the worst thing that could 
have happened to taxpayers? We invest 
in a vaccine that turns out not to 
work, and, at that point we step in, 
meet our commitment—in essence, buy 
the vaccine that didn’t work—be sure 
that it is effectively destroyed, and re-
alize that that was a chance that we 
took that didn’t produce a result. But 
the other vaccines that did work had a 
result and had vaccine available as 
soon as they were approved. 
In fact, General Perna, Operation 
Warp Speed’s chief operating officer, 
said the government would begin vac-
cinations within 24 hours after a vac-
cine secures FDA approval. In the past, 
I would say you would be closer to say-
ing it will be 12 or 24 months after ap-
proval before the first vaccine is ready 
to go to the first person, but now we 
are saying 24 hours, and we are on the 
edge of that 24 hours. 
I talked today with the Governor of 
my State, the Governor of Missouri, 
Mike Parson, and the head of the Mis-
souri Department of Health and Senior 
Services, Dr. Randall Williams, about 
what they were doing. They submitted 
a plan early. I was with the Governor— 
I think it was in mid-August—when the 
Centers for Disease Control told all the 
Governors: We want to have a plan by 
the end of October of how you are 
going to distribute this vaccine when 
you get it. 
I said at about that same time that if 
we failed in our effort to get the vac-
cine effectively distributed after the ef-
fort we made to get it, it would be one 
of the great government failures of all 
time. 
But Governor Parson, Dr. Williams, 
and others who have worked hard on 
this in our State put a plan in and put 
it in pretty early and now are ready to 
execute that plan as soon as they have 
the vaccine available to them. 
About 2 percent of the population of 
the country lives in Missouri, and so 
about 2 percent of every distribution 
will go to Missouri as vaccines are 
ready. 
Pfizer will have about 25 million vac-
cines 
to 
distribute 
almost 
imme-
diately. Moderna will have about 20 
million to distribute almost imme-
diately. And we know that others are 
standing right behind them. 
Another thing that Congress asked 
the Centers for Disease Control to do 
was to come up with a recommendation 
on who the vaccine should be given to. 
And just this week the CDC advisory 
committee made their recommenda-
tion to the Centers for Disease Control. 
Either today or sometime soon after 
today, the CDC, in all likelihood, will 
adopt those recommendations as they 
have in this past. 
The recommendations go something 
like this: First, you want to prioritize 
healthcare workers and people most 
likely to have the worst result if they 
catch the virus. So if you take all the 
healthcare workers in America and all 
the people in a senior living kind of 
condition in America, you are talking 
about around 15 percent of the popu-
lation. 
Somewhere in there, either in that 
group or the next group, you include 
all the first responders and police offi-
cers in the country, who come into sit-
uations so often that they have no con-
trol over, and then you go to the other 
essential employees in America—the 
childcare center worker, the school-
teacher, the busdriver, the grocery 
store clerk, the food processing person 
who is out there making this happen. 
I think there has been some decision 
made on the healthcare workers that 
we 
should 
include 
clergy 
in 
the 
healthcare workers because they are so 
often present in hospitals and with peo-
ple in circumstances where they would 
like to see someone from their faith 
present, but that person also is a 
healthcare provider in the healthcare 
network and, just like others working 
in the hospital, will be able to get that 
early vaccination. 
But let’s go back to the essential 
workforce. The essential workforce of 
the groups we have talked about and 
others who come into lots of contact 
with people are often least able to 
make arrangements in their own time 
to even get a vaccine if it is for free. 
They are going to be a big priority. 
When I go to the grocery store and I 
ask someone for help, which I often 
need to do to find the one thing on my 
list I don’t know how to find, or when 
I go by to check out with the grocery 
store clerk, if the grocery store clerk, 
no matter how big the shield is be-
tween them and me, if they couldn’t 
possibly get it from the person who 
checked out 2 days earlier or early that 
day, they can’t possibly give it to me. 
So every step of the way, the whole 
country becomes safer until, hopefully, 
by the end of April or so, we are at a 
place where everybody has access to 
the vaccine. 
By the way, by the time you do the 15 
percent of the population that is most 
likely to have a bad result if they get 
the virus and healthcare workers and

add that to the 35 percent of the popu-
lation that is the essential workforce, 
that is 50 percent of the population 
that could have the vaccine if they 
chose to have it. 
I think most people think that we 
are there, in our State and other 
places, by sometime in April. In fact, 
Dr. Fauci said that Americans deter-
mined to be at the highest risk— 
healthcare workers, frontline workers, 
seniors, those with underlying condi-
tions—could be vaccinated by the end 
of the year. 
Certainly, if there is a second shot, it 
might be by the end of January, and 
you have 15 percent of the whole popu-
lation vaccinated by the end of Janu-
ary or sometime in January, and an-
other 35 percent would have the vac-
cine available to them by sometime in 
April. 
Then we look at the rest of the popu-
lation. But in each step of the way—let 
me say again—every time you take 
somebody off the playing field of where 
contact with the virus could success-
fully occur, everybody else gets safer 
too. 
If a person who has been vaccinated 
is where the germs happen to land in-
stead of the person standing beside 
them who wasn’t vaccinated, the life of 
that particular germ is gone, and even-
tually that is how you emerge from a 
pandemic. There just aren’t enough 
people left for this to land on that ei-
ther haven’t had it or haven’t had the 
vaccine to prevent it. 
It is a critical time. It is an impor-
tant time. I think we have written two 
new chapters in pandemic response, 
both in testing and in vaccines. 
Operation Warp Speed has done in 
months what typically can take 10 to 
15 years and, even in an expedited way, 
can take 2 to 3 to 5 years. 
Given the urgent need to beat this 
virus, I think Operation Warp Speed, 
with the great scientific community—a 
lot of this is built on research that was 
funded by NIH. One of the priorities of 
the Congress for the last 5 years has 
been to increase NIH funding, at a time 
when we know more about genetics. 
Two of these vaccines are basically 
based on the molecular code that is 
sort of the software for genetics. It is a 
different way than vaccines have been 
developed before and would not have 
been developed without government- 
encouraged research. 
Having a diverse selection of vac-
cines means there are different people 
producing vaccines at the same time in 
different places, and we will have, more 
likely, a quick and fair distribution of 
any FDA-authorized vaccines. 
Certainly, I have been frustrated, as 
many of us have, to think that we have 
not been able to reach an agreement on 
what money we might need to finish 
this vaccine effort, the distribution ef-
fort. 
Hopefully, we can come to the next 
round of COVID relief sooner rather 
than later. 
As I said earlier this week, a targeted 
funding package now will have a lot 
more impact than a much bigger pack-
age would have 4 or 5 months from 
now. There is no reason we shouldn’t be 
able to find common ground. This is a 
time when we can make that effort to 
finish the job. The pandemic is affect-
ing Americans every day. I have talked 
to a lot of people who have seen greater 
numbers of drug dependency and huge 
declines in mental health because that 
support network is gone and isolation 
has taken over, and worry about fam-
ily, finances, and health has become a 
big part of that. 
Let’s show the people we work for 
that we are going to be able to con-
tinue this job, and let’s praise the 
great researchers in our country and 
others who stepped forward in incred-
ible ways to do things that just 9 
months ago nobody thought could pos-
sibly be established in the timeframe 
we are working on right now.

REMEBERING CHARLES CARROLL 
SMITH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a few moments to say fare-
well to a friend and a public servant 
who served my State of Illinois and our 
Nation well. His name was Charles Car-
roll Smith, but his friends called him 
Charlie. He died on the day after 
Thanksgiving. Our paths crossed often 
over the years. 
Charlie served as Illinois’ deputy sec-
retary of state under then-Secretary of 
State Alan Dixon. When Alan Dixon 
was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980, 
Charlie came to Washington with him. 
He was a key member of the Dixon 
staff, serving as both legislative direc-
tor and senior national security ad-
viser. When Alan Dixon left the Senate, 
Charlie joined the staff of Kentucky 
Senator Wendell Ford, then the Sen-
ate’s Democratic whip. Charlie was 
Senator Ford’s legislative staff direc-
tor and a trusted adviser to Senator 
Ford on matters involving national se-
curity and foreign relations. 
He helped craft and pass many impor-
tant pieces of legislation, including the 
1990 law establishing the Defense Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission 
in 1990. He went on to serve as execu-
tive director of the 1995 Defense Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission- 
a massive task to try to realign Amer-
ica’s military bases with the realities 
of the post-Cold War world. 
The work of the Base Closure Com-
mission was necessary, complex, and 
historic, and Charlie’s intricate under-
standing of both the Defense Depart-
ment and the security needs of Amer-
ica and our allies was critical to the 
commission’s success. Despite the gar-
gantuan task, Charlie was never too 
busy to listen. I and all of the Members 
of the Illinois congressional delegation 
appreciated his willingness to always 
consider fairly our explanations about 
the national security importance of the 
military bases in our State. He never 
put his thumb on the scale for Illinois, 
but he made sure that we received a 
fair hearing. The day the commission 
announced 
its 
recommendations 
in 
2005, Charlie called me to explain in 
layman’s language just what the rec-
ommendations meant for Illinois and 
for America. I have never met anyone 
with a greater understanding of the 
workings of the Defense Department 
and the ability to translate that 
knowledge into plain English. He was a 
rare one. 
Charlie came by his political and leg-
islative skills the old-fashioned way. 
He inherited them. He grew up in an 
Irish Catholic Democratic family on 
the North Side of Chicago. His father 
was in politics; his mother was a pro-
fessor. Charlie was the first-born and 
only son in the family of three chil-
dren. 
The Smith family took politics and 
democracy seriously. Charlie and his 
father were both named Charles Carroll 
Smith, senior and junior. Family leg-
end has it that they were descended 
from Charles Carroll, one of the signers 
of America’s Declaration of Independ-
ence and a member of the Continental 
Congress. Whether it was true or not—

this was before at-home DNA testing— 
the Smith family strove to live up to 
Charles Carroll’s patriotic example. 
When Charlie was about 11, his father 
decided that the Smith family home 
should be a laboratory of democracy. 
They would discuss important events 
at the dinner table, and once a week, 
they would have a meeting to vote on 
matters involving the family. After 
just one or two of these family meet-
ings, Charlie had an epiphany. He told 
his sister Sheila: ‘‘You know, if we 
three kids stick together, we can out-
vote Mom and Dad.’’ He said: ‘‘I want a 
bike. What do you want?’’ Charlie fig-
ured out what both of his sisters want-
ed and how to deliver it. At the next 
family meeting, the girls supported 
Charlie’s proposal to buy him a bike. 
The kids won, and Charlie got his bike. 
The Smith family never held another 
family vote, but Charlie would go on to 
use his coalition-building skills in the 
interest of public service for the rest of 
his life. 
In 1968, Charlie joined the U.S. Army 
and served as an intelligence officer in 
Vietnam during the Tet offensive. 
He left public service in 1999 and 
began his second career as a lobbyist. 
He was respected by members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle as a 
straight shooter and a good man. 
Besides his family, politics, and pub-
lic service, Charlie loved the Chicago 
Bears and the Cubs and playing golf. 
Every Christmas season, Charlie hosted 
a party for his friends at the Army 
Navy Country Club in Arlington, VA. It 
was always a great, bipartisan celebra-
tion. This Friday, Charlie’s friends will 
gather by Zoom to remember him on 
what would have been his 26th annual 
Christmas party. He will be missed 
there, and he will be missed in the 
halls of Congress, in his old neighbor-
hood in Chicago, and many other 
places. 
Loretta and I send our condolences to 
Charlie’s wife Patti Turner; his sisters, 
Sheila Smith and Catherine Wilson; 
and his many, many friends.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA NOWLIN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Laura Nowlin of Teton County for her 
compassion and dedication to her com-
munity. 
Since 1986, Laura has devoted her 
time to working at the Teton County 
Food Pantry as both a volunteer and a 
member of the executive board. Over 
the course of her 33 years at the food 
pantry, she ensured families in the 
community had healthy and hearty 
groceries with no exceptions. Rain or 
shine, Laura was always there to help 
the people of Teton County get the nu-
trition they needed. 
Recently named a board member 
emeritus of the pantry, Laura will be 
dearly missed by her colleagues. Her 
unwavering selflessness was an incred-
ibly valuable asset to both the pantry 
and her community. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Laura for her tireless service to the 
people of Teton County. Her kindness 
and charitable approach to work serves 
as an inspiration to all Montanans who 
serve our communities.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ROY LEE LINDSEY 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to recognize Mr. Roy Lee 
Lindsey for his 22 years of service at 
the Oklahoma Pork Council. Since 
1998, he has served as a steadfast advo-
cate for pork producers and the agri-
culture industry in Oklahoma and we 
are grateful for his years of service. 
Over the years, I have had the experi-
ence of working directly with Roy Lee 
on a number of issues, and I have 
greatly valued his insight, partnership, 
and dedication to ensuring the hard-
working pork producers in the State of 
Oklahoma have access to the Federal 
resources they need. Anyone who has 
had the pleasure to meet and work 
with Roy Lee can attest for his love of 
the state of Oklahoma and the pork in-
dustry. His unwavering passion and 
dedication have enabled him to be an 
extraordinary ambassador for Okla-
homa, both regionally and nationally. 
From sharing producers’ perspectives 
on multiple farm bill reauthorizations 
to engaging in workforce development 
initiatives to educate our future gen-
eration of farmers, Roy Lee has always 
provided a judicious, thoughtful, and 
considerate perspective on Federal pol-
icy. His understanding of the chal-
lenges of agriculture production and 
appreciation for the producers he rep-
resents has consistently been apparent 
in his advocacy efforts and instru-
mental in the pork industry’s growth 
and prosperity in Oklahoma. 
I know I join his family and all that 
know him in thanking him for his 
years of service and contributions to 
Oklahoma and our entire agriculture 
community.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BRENT HILL 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, along 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
MIKE 
CRAPO, I rise today to recognize Idaho 
State Senate President Pro Tempore 
Brent Hill’s 19 years of service to the 
State of Idaho. 
In 2001, Brent Hill was appointed to 
lead Idaho’s 34th District as a State 
senator. He quickly developed a reputa-
tion as a legislator who led with integ-
rity, civility and kindness—character-
istics that earned him reelection to 
serve nine consecutive terms in the 
Idaho State Senate. 
In the Idaho Senate and throughout 
the 34th District, Brent was known as a 
stalwart supporter of small businesses, 
family values, natural resources, and 
public education. Brent’s expansive 
knowledge of the Federal and State tax 
codes from his experience as a CEO, 
CPA, and a financial planner allowed 
him to shape Idaho’s tax policy and 
communicate complex tax legislation 
to fellow legislators and constituents. 
He considered tax dollars sacred and 
took great care in spending them re-
sponsibly. 
As he climbed the ranks of leadership 
to 
become 
president 
pro 
tempore, 
Brent never forgot the people he served 
in Madison and Bonneville Counties 
and always demonstrated true concern 
for their challenges and concerns. De-
spite the demands on his time, he con-
tinued to serve his community on the 
board of the Citizens Community Bank 
and as president of the Rexburg Cham-
ber of Commerce and Rexburg Kiwanis 
Club. He never stopped advocating on 
behalf of his constituents, regularly 
contacting our offices to secure assist-
ance for those needing help with Fed-
eral agencies. 
Senator Brent Hill leaves behind a 
legacy of service and integrity, and we 
wish him and his wife Julie, their chil-
dren and grandchildren the best as he 
transitions back to private life. His 
steadfast leadership will be missed in 
the Idaho Senate, but we know his 
community and our State will continue 
to be blessed by his influence for years 
to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAYOR JOHN PAUL 
CHRISTENSEN 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, we rise 
to congratulate John Paul Christensen 
on his lifetime of service to the State 
of Utah and Sanpete County and most 
recently 
his 
service 
as 
mayor 
of 
Mayfield, UT. John’s service also in-
cludes a career in law enforcement, as 
an emergency medical responder and as 
a city councilman. 
As 
a 
sixth-generation 
native 
of 
Sanpete County, John has dedicated 
his life to the betterment of his com-
munity. By virtue of his stewardship as 
mayor, the people of Mayfield have 
John to thank for dramatic improve-
ments to the city’s infrastructure, in-
cluding its culinary water and drainage 
systems, streets, roadways, cemetery, 
and 
Mayfield 
Park. 
Mayor 
Christensen’s 
accomplishments 
are 
made possible in large part by the in-
dustrious community of volunteers and 
spirit 
of 
friendship 
that 
Mayfield 
boasts. 
The residents of Mayfield know John 
as a man of great character and com-
passion. In law enforcement and as an 
emergency medical responder, the com-
munity trusted John with protecting 
their lives and livelihoods, an often 
thankless duty that requires mental 
fortitude and dedication to serving the 
greater good. His long tenure in public 
service is evidence of his success. 
Although he is leaving public office, 
we know that John will continue to 
serve his community and family with 
heart. As a devoted husband to Julie, a 
father of 9, and a grandfather of 19, 
John’s legacy and example will endure. 
The great people of Mayfield, Sanpete

TRIBUTE TO RALPH OKERLUND 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, we wish 
to congratulate State Senator Ralph 
Okerlund on a remarkable career dedi-
cated to the relentless advancement of 
prosperity for the great State of Utah. 
For the many Utahns lucky enough to 
know him personally—from the hills of 
Monroe to the halls of the State legis-
lature—it is no surprise that Ralph has 
chosen to spend more time with his 
loving family following a consequential 
tenure in public life. Even for the many 
Utahns to whom Ralph is still un-
known, his influence on civic life 
through 
his 
statewide 
legislative 
achievements is significant and endur-
ing. 
Senator Okerlund’s success can be 
measured in tangible improvements in 
his district and across the State. His 
legislative efforts to facilitate invest-
ment in Utah’s infrastructure projects, 
with tax credit incentives and coordi-
nation with the State energy and eco-
nomic 
development 
offices, 
have 
brought billions of dollars to Utah—a 
massive boon to the State’s economy 
and its rural counties. In addition, his 
efforts through the legislative appro-
priations process delivered Snow Col-
lege a new building and higher pay for 
its employees. As a member of the leg-
islative leadership on Capitol Hill, Sen-
ator Okerlund kept his commitment to 
allocate tax dollars wisely and effec-
tively. 
Senator Okerlund’s success can also 
be measured by his family and by his 
fortitude. 
His 
professional 
journey 
began as a teacher, with degrees from 
Dixie College and the University of 
Utah. Ralph then returned to Monroe 
to help run his family farm and to be 
closer to his father, whose injury com-
pelled his return. Okerlund would ac-
quire and later sell the dairy but ran 
the farm for years until his election to 
the Monroe City Council. Apace with 
his subsequent ascensions to the may-
or’s office, Sevier County commission, 
State senate, and ultimately senate 
majority leader, is his family of chil-
dren and grandchildren beside him, in-
cluding his beloved wife Cindy, who 
call Monroe home. Ralph has persisted 
through hardship with the support of 
his family. 
A tireless champion for rural Utah, 
Senator Okerlund has represented the 
unique challenges and opportunities 
facing farmers, ranchers, and rural 
folks at the State and national level as 
president of the Council of State Gov-
ernments Western Association. In this 
role, he represented Utah’s interests 
among neighboring States with com-
peting ideas on how to manage critical 
issues like regional energy and land 
management. His successes in these ef-
forts is undoubtedly owed to his deep 
understanding of the issues as a man 
raised in Monroe. 
Few can boast the wealth of personal 
and professional experiences amassed 
by Ralph Okerlund in his long and dis-
tinguished career—from dairyman to 
senate 
majority 
leader—but 
every 
Utahn can admire and follow his com-
mitment to service. His record in gov-
ernment is not marked by expedience 
but, rather, by a willingness to rise to 
the occasion and answer the call of his 
neighbors and friends who seek his reli-
able judgement and sound leadership. 
Ralph Okerlund has led for 36 years as 
an elected official and will continue to 
serve his family, his friends, and his 
community with grace and humility.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–261. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana Congressional delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to defeat pas-
sage of the ‘‘Ocean-Based Climate Solutions 
Act of 2020’’ and to protect future opportuni-
ties for oil and gas exploration on the Outer 
Continental Shelf; to the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 38 
Whereas, Rau´ l M. Grijalva (D–Ariz.), Chair-
man of the United States House Committee 
on Natural Resources has unveiled legisla-
tion entitled the ‘‘Ocean-Based Climate So-
lutions Act of 2020’’ with the intent to in-
clude ocean impacts of climate change in the 
discussions of methods to address climate 
change mitigation; and 
Whereas, in an effort to restore coastal 
ecosystems, 
strengthen 
marine 
mammal 
conservation, reduce carbon emissions from 
shipping 
vessels, 
improve 
international 
ocean governance, and pursue other ocean- 
related solutions to the climate change cri-
sis, the legislation seeks to end the federal 
offshore oil-leasing program; and 
Whereas, although these pursuits sound 
laudable, it is important to remember that 
the Louisiana oil and gas industry supports 
nearly two hundred and fifty thousand jobs 
inside the state of Louisiana and more in ad-
joining states, it accounts for fourteen per-
cent of the state’s tax revenue, and supplies 
$73 billion of the state’s gross domestic prod-
uct; and 
Whereas, an analysis has found that such a 
proposal, if enacted, would cause the loss of 
nearly one million jobs nationwide in the 
first twelve to twenty-four months, forty- 
eight thousand of which are located here in 
Louisiana; and 
Whereas, this proposal would significantly 
reduce our domestic energy production, 
making our nation more dependent on less 
reliable, less safe foreign sources for energy 
produced under weaker environmental stand-
ards and a higher carbon footprint; and 
Whereas, with energy demand expected to 
continue to rise until at least 2040, Louisiana 
currently produces nearly twenty percent of 
our nation’s energy, refines approximately 
forty-five percent of the total United States 
petroleum, and processes fifty-one percent of 
the nation’s natural gas; and 
Whereas, while meeting this demand year 
after year, Louisiana energy producers are at 
the forefront of carbon emissions reduction 
technology development like carbon capture 
and storage that can capture ninety percent 
of carbon emissions from fossil fuels; and 
Whereas, in addition, the offshore oil and 
gas industry in the United States operates 
under some of the most stringent environ-
mental rules in the world and its infrastruc-
ture also supports some of the most abun-
dant fish habitat providing fishing opportu-
nities 
that 
have 
made 
Louisiana 
the 
‘‘Sportsman’s Paradise’’; and 
Whereas, protecting leasing and production 
in the Outer Continental Shelf will help 
combat climate change by helping our state 
combat coastal land loss and sustain oil and 
gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico critical 
to energy innovations needed to reduce car-
bon emissions; and 
Whereas, Louisiana and its local econo-
mies, especially communities reliant on en-
ergy development and production, have felt 
an outsized impact from the COVID–19 pan-
demic and are expected to face a slower re-
covery than many other states because of 
our large service sector employment; and 
Whereas, Louisiana already faces major 
budget shortfalls that will impact schools, 
emergency services, and other essential serv-
ices; and 
Whereas, under the provisions of the Gulf 
of Mexico Security Act, in 2019 alone energy 
production on the Outer Continental Shelf 
generated over $155 million to the state of 
Louisiana used for coastal restoration and 
hurricane preparedness; and 
Whereas, ensuring access to available leas-
ing acreage on the Outer Continental Shelf 
will protect offshore energy production as an 
essential part of our state’s budget when our 
state and local governments need it the 
most; therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the Louisiana Con-
gressional Delegation and the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to defeat passage of the ‘‘Ocean-Based 
Climate Solutions Act of 2020’’ and to pro-
tect future opportunities for oil and gas ex-
ploration on the Outer Continental Shelf; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana Con-
gressional Delegation.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 788—RECOG-
NIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
FOR THE JED FOUNDATION 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 788 
Whereas, 20 years ago, Donna and Phillip 
Satow set out to launch a blueprint for sui-
cide prevention with the founding of the Jed 
Foundation; 
Whereas Donna and Phillip tragically lost 
their son, Jed, 2 years earlier to suicide; 
Whereas they recognized the need for a 
uniform model for suicide prevention on col-
lege and university campuses and the need to 
address the stigma and secrecy associated 
with mental health in these communities; 
Whereas campus prevention programs at 
the time were limited in scope and priority, 
and the Satows are to be commended for 
their dedication to mental health and cre-
ating the Jed Foundation, a national non-
profit organization, to surmount those hur-
dles; 
Whereas, through their passion, vision, and 
dedication to the Jed Foundation, the 
Satows have worked tirelessly to transform 
the way teen and young adult mental health 
is understood and supported; 
Whereas, due to the commitment and vi-
sion of the Satows, the Jed Foundation is a 
recognized leader in transforming policies, 
programs, and systems to protect the mental 
and emotional health of, and prevent suicide 
for, teens and young adults; 
Whereas, 
through 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Satows, the Jed Foundation created JED 
Campus, a program which has helped imple-
ment a comprehensive approach to mental 
health for over 300 colleges and universities 
representing 
nearly 
3,700,000 
students, 
strengthening their mental health, sub-
stance use, and suicide prevention programs; 
Whereas, in the past 20 years, the Jed 
Foundation has provided programs and re-
sources that have helped more than 3,000 
high 
schools, 
colleges, 
and 
universities 
strengthen their mental health safety nets 
for teens and young adults throughout the 
Nation; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation has educated 
over 10,000 high school, college, university, 
and other mental health professionals in sui-
cide prevention through various educational 
initiatives; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation has partnered 
with over 1,600 college and universities to 
utilize the Foundation’s ULifeline.org online 
resource center to provide students with in-
formation about mental health and how to 
seek help if they are struggling; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation and the 
Satow’s vision have continued to address the 
mental health needs of diverse communities 
by ensuring that mental health resources are 
culturally responsive and providing key re-
sources in Spanish for Latinx teens, young 
adults, and their families; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation and the 
Satow’s dedication to mental health has led 
to in-depth research to help schools and com-
munities more effectively understand and 
support the mental health of LGBTQ+ teens 
and young adults; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation has created a 
national campaign, Seize the Awkward, to 
encourage teens and young adults to start a 
conversation with a friend who may be 
struggling with mental health issues; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation’s anonymous 
mental health self-evaluator has been used 
by students over 400,000 times to assess their 
symptoms and receive customized informa-
tion about how to seek help for their mental 
health needs; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation works toward 
a future where every high school, college, 
and university has a comprehensive mental 
health system that supports mental and

emotional health and reduces the risk of sub-
stance misuse and suicide for teens and 
young adults; 
Whereas the Jed Foundation, through the 
Satow’s vision and commitment, works to 
equip all teens and young adults with the 
ability to navigate mental health challenges, 
to seek and give help, and to emotionally 
prepare them to enter adulthood and fulfill 
their potential; and 
Whereas the Jed Foundation works to have 
mental health recognized as part of general 
health and wellness, and to reduce the 
shame, secrecy, or prejudice often associated 
with mental health: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the 
Jed Foundation; 
(2) commends Donna and Phillip Satow for 
their vision, continued commitment, and 
leadership; and 
(3) applauds the Jed Foundation for being a 
leading organization promoting the well- 
being of students, families, and schools and 
paving the way for more young people to find 
the resources and the support they need.

SENATE RESOLUTION 789—URGING 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND 
TO PROTECT AND UPHOLD DE-
MOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 
RULE OF LAW, AND RIGHTS TO 
FREEDOM OF PEACEFUL ASSEM-
BLY AND FREEDOM OF EXPRES-
SION, 
AND 
FOR 
OTHER 
PUR-
POSES 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, Mr. CARDIN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. MARKEY, Mrs. SHAHEEN, 
Ms. DUCKWORTH, and Mr. MURPHY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 789 
Whereas the Kingdom of Thailand and the 
United States of America first established 
relations in 1818 and entered into the Treaty 
of Amity and Commerce in 1833, formalizing 
diplomatic relations; 
Whereas Thailand was the first treaty ally 
of the United States in the Asia-Pacific re-
gion and remains a steadfast friend of the 
United States with shared values of democ-
racy, rule of law, universal human rights, 
and a free market; 
Whereas the United States and Thailand in 
1954 signed the Southeast Asia Collective De-
fense Treaty (Manila Pact), pledging to 
‘‘strengthen the fabric of peace and freedom 
and to uphold the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty and the rule of law’’; 
Whereas, through the Treaty of Amity and 
Economic Relations of 1966, along with a di-
verse and growing trading relationship, the 
United States and Thailand have developed 
strong economic ties; 
Whereas the United States recognizes 
Thailand as a founding member of the Asso-
ciation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
and host of the 35th ASEAN Summit in 2019, 
which reaffirmed that body’s commitment to 
‘‘a region of lasting peace, security and sta-
bility, sustained economic growth, shared 
prosperity and social progress’’; 
Whereas Thailand was designated a major 
non-NATO ally in 2003, and is one of the 
strongest security partners of the United 
States, a relationship that was recognized 
and expanded upon in the United States- 
Thailand Joint Vision Statement for the 
Thai-United States Defense Alliance in 2012; 
Whereas the Governments of Thailand and 
the United States hold numerous joint mili-
tary exercises, including Cobra Gold, the 
largest annual multinational military exer-
cise in the Indo-Pacific region, which is 
hosted by Thailand; 
Whereas the Government of Thailand con-
tinues to be a partner on humanitarian and 
refugee assistance, including support from U- 
Tapao Royal Thai Navy Air Field for multi-
national relief efforts following the 2004 In-
dian Ocean tsunami and 2015 Nepal earth-
quake; 
Whereas Thailand ended absolute mon-
archy and transitioned to a constitutional 
monarchy in 1932, and since then has revised 
its constitution seventeen times, including a 
1997 constitution that enshrined democrat-
ically elected representatives in a bicameral 
national assembly and the prime minister as 
head of government, and a 2007 constitution 
that largely retained that structure; 
Whereas cycles of coups and military rule 
have been a recurring feature of governance 
in Thailand for almost a century; 
Whereas the Royal Thai military con-
ducted a coup in 2014, abolished the 2007 con-
stitution, declared martial law, and replaced 
the civilian government with a junta under 
the leadership of Army Commander Prayuth 
Chan-ocha; 
Whereas the junta’s National Council for 
Peace and Order drafted a new constitution 
which was promulgated in 2017, and served to 
erode Thailand’s democracy and constitu-
tional protection of rights; 
Whereas, in March 2019, Thailand held elec-
tions that several independent monitoring 
groups declared as deeply flawed and heavily 
tilted to favor the military junta, whose 
party, headed by Prayuth, formed a new gov-
ernment with the support of the military-ap-
pointed and unelected Senate; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the opposition 
political party Future Forward was dissolved 
and banned on order of the Constitutional 
Court following a flawed legal process pre-
mised on spurious charges; 
Whereas the Government of Thailand has 
failed to properly investigate issues with re-
spect to violent assaults against democracy 
activists and government critics within 
Thailand, as well as enforced disappearances 
and killings of exiled Thai political dis-
sidents across Asia; 
Whereas, since February 2020, tens of thou-
sands of protesters across Thailand, largely 
students and youth, have peacefully called 
for democratically elected government, con-
stitutional reform, and respect for human 
rights; 
Whereas the Government of Thailand has 
responded to these peaceful protests with re-
pressive measures, including intimidation 
tactics, surveillance, harassment, arrests, vi-
olence and imprisonment; 
Whereas Prayuth declared a state of emer-
gency on October 15, 2020, and characterized 
the 
growing 
pro-democracy 
protests 
as 
threats to national security and public safe-
ty; 
Whereas more than 170 peaceful protesters 
have been arrested since February 2020, 
many of them charged with serious crimes, 
including sedition, that carry potentially 
long prison sentences; and 
Whereas UNICEF has expressed concern 
about the potential harm that children face 
amidst the ongoing protests in Thailand and 
called on all parties to uphold children and 
young people’s right to freedom of expression 
and peaceful assembly, and to protect them 
from all forms of violence and intimidation: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the strong relationship be-
tween the United States and Thailand based 
on shared democratic values and strategic 
interests; 
(2) stands in solidarity with the people of 
Thailand in their quest for a democratically 
elected government, political reforms, long- 
term peace, and respect for established inter-
national human rights standards; 
(3) urges the Government of Thailand to 
protect 
and 
uphold 
democracy, 
human 
rights, the rule of law, and rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and freedom of expres-
sion, as well as immediately and uncondi-
tionally release political activists and re-
frain from harassing, intimidating, or perse-
cuting those engaged in peaceful protests, 
with particular care for the rights and well- 
being of children and students; 
(4) calls on the United States Government 
to support the right of the people of Thai-
land to peacefully and democratically deter-
mine their future; and 
(5) unequivocally states that a military 
coup to resolve the current political crisis 
would be counterproductive and risk further 
undermining bilateral relations between the 
United States and Thailand.

790—SUP-
PORTING 
EFFORTS 
TO 
STRENGTHEN PROTECTION, AS-
SISTANCE, AND SOLUTIONS FOR 
VENEZUELAN WOMEN AND CHIL-
DREN 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, and Mr. DURBIN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 790 
Whereas over 5,400,000 Venezuelans have 
been displaced across Latin America and the 
Caribbean—the world’s second largest dis-
placement crisis—and at least 7,000,000 peo-
ple inside Venezuela are in need of humani-
tarian assistance as a result of the country’s 
ongoing political and economic crisis; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic is exacer-
bating the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, 
given the country’s weak health infrastruc-
ture, and posing particular risks for Ven-
ezuelan refugees and migrants such as evic-
tion, loss of livelihoods, border closures and 
other travel restrictions, lack of access to 
health care for those without documenta-
tion, and gender-based violence; 
Whereas it is well-recognized that displace-
ment crises— 
(1) exacerbate pre-existing violence against 
women and girls; 
(2) interrupt children’s education and in-
crease their exposure to violence and exploi-
tation; 
(3) cause major stress and trauma on indi-
viduals and families that can have profound 
effects on mental health and result in sig-
nificant needs for psychological and social 
support; and 
(4) disrupt family and community connec-
tions that mitigate against such violence 
and trauma; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2016, maternal 
mortality rates in Venezuela increased by 65 
percent and infant mortality within the first 
week of life increased by 53 percent, and the 
dire state of Venezuela’s public health sys-
tem has compelled women to flee the coun-
try in order to give birth; 
Whereas one-third of Venezuelan house-
holds are food insecure, with the greatest 
risk of adverse nutritional impacts on chil-
dren, pregnant and lactating women, and the 
elderly, according to the World Food Pro-
gram; 
Whereas the growing prevalence of crimi-
nal violence, especially intimate partner vio-
lence, and human trafficking, endemic cor-
ruption, and impunity in Venezuela has con-
tributed 
to 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
femicides;

December 3, 2020 
Whereas Venezuelan women and girls re-
port an increase in pregnancies of adolescent 
girls over the past 2 years, including many 
resulting from sexual violence and coercion; 
Whereas indigenous women and girls in 
Venezuela’s border communities face height-
ened risks of violence as a result of extreme 
poverty, discrimination, and the encroach-
ment of extractive mining industries on 
their land; 
Whereas women and girls fleeing Ven-
ezuela face grave threats of sexual violence, 
exploitation, 
and 
trafficking 
by 
armed 
groups operating in border regions, such as 
the Eje´rcito de Liberacio´n Nacional (ELN), 
and these threats have grown since COVID- 
related border closures have forced asylum 
seekers into unofficial border crossing routes 
(‘‘trochas’’); 
Whereas the trafficking of Venezuelan 
women and children is linked to organized 
crime and armed groups, which often kidnap 
girls into trafficking networks in other 
countries and, in addition, forcibly recruit 
boys and young men; 
Whereas, despite the generous policies of 
host countries, less than half of Venezuelan 
refugee and migrant children were attending 
school prior to COVID-related closures, be-
cause of lack of documentation to enroll, 
limited space in public schools, and lack of 
resources to pay fees; 
Whereas governments throughout Latin 
America and the Caribbean have partici-
pated in a series of technical meetings to co-
ordinate a regional strategy for the protec-
tion and regularization of Venezuelan refu-
gees and migrants—known as the ‘‘Quito 
Process’’—and issued a joint declaration in 
November 2019 that agreed to strengthen 
measures against human trafficking, gender- 
based violence, discrimination, and xeno-
phobia, and to establish a regional protec-
tion protocol for refugee and migrant chil-
dren and adolescents; 
Whereas the United States has committed 
to strengthen international protection of 
women and children through the U.S. Strat-
egy on Women, Peace, and Security, which 
aims to ‘‘promote the protection of women 
and girls’ human rights; access to humani-
tarian assistance; and safety from violence, 
abuse, and exploitation around the world’’, 
as well as through the U.S. Government 
Strategy on Advancing Protection and Care 
for Children in Adversity; and 
Whereas the international community has 
prioritized addressing the issue of gender- 
based violence in humanitarian contexts by 
establishing a Safe from the Start initiative, 
implemented by the Department of State 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses grave concern for the massive 
and growing humanitarian needs of Ven-
ezuelans, including over 5,400,000 Venezuelan 
refugees and migrants, with particular con-
cern for the impact of the displacement cri-
sis and the COVID–19 pandemic on women 
and children; 
(2) 
recognizes 
the 
many 
communities 
across Latin America and the Caribbean that 
continue to generously receive and host Ven-
ezuelan refugees and migrants while also 
fighting to recover from the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
(3) appreciates participation in the Quito 
Process by the Governments of Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Do-
minican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Mexico, 
Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, and 
encourages implementation of their commit-
ments to strengthen national processes of 
documentation and registration and to bol-
ster protections for Venezuelan refugees and 
migrants subject to gender-based violence, 
human trafficking, and xenophobia; 
(4) encourages governments hosting Ven-
ezuelan refugees and migrants, as well as 
international and nongovernmental organi-
zations providing assistance, to ensure that 
shelter, health care, food assistance, mental 
health and psychosocial support, and other 
basic services are accessible to women and 
children; 
(5) calls on the international community, 
including both humanitarian and develop-
ment actors, to focus greater attention and 
resources to address the violence, abuse, and 
exploitation suffered by Venezuelan women 
and children, including by disaggregating 
data by sex and age in needs assessments and 
program reporting; and 
(6) supports increasing United States diplo-
matic initiatives and humanitarian assist-
ance to strengthen protections for Ven-
ezuelan refugees and migrants and their host 
communities, with an emphasis on the pro-
tection of women and children.

SENATE RESOLUTION 791—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 2020 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL COLLEGE APPLICATION 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, Mr. CARPER, and Ms. 
ERNST) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 791 
Whereas equality of opportunity for all 
people is one of the noblest aspirations of the 
United States; 
Whereas data on the benefits of higher edu-
cation demonstrate that, in spite of ongoing 
barriers to access and student success, col-
leges and universities can still provide path-
ways to economic opportunity; 
Whereas the United States built a thriving 
middle class by funding colleges and univer-
sities to provide avenues to individual eco-
nomic opportunity and shared economic 
growth; 
Whereas higher education enhances the 
economic mobility of individuals, which is 
evidenced by— 
(1) a finding by the Brookings Institute 
that the median lifetime earnings of holders 
of an associate degree are uniformly greater 
than the median lifetime earnings of holders 
of solely a high school diploma; and 
(2) a finding by the Pew Economic Mobility 
Project that, for an individual born in the 
lowest income quintile, obtaining a 4-year 
degree or a higher degree is associated 
with— 
(A) an approximately 70 percent dif-
ference in the probability of that indi-
vidual earning an income outside the low-
est income quintile; and 
(B) a threefold difference in the prob-
ability of that individual going on to earn 
an income in the highest income quintile; 
Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics re-
ports that— 
(1) the unemployment rate of high school 
graduates in 2019 who did not immediately 
matriculate to an institution of higher edu-
cation the following fall semester was 18.2 
percent, which is significantly higher than 
the overall unemployment rate of the United 
States; 
(2) approximately 34 percent of high school 
graduates in 2019 did not immediately ma-
triculate to an institution of higher edu-
cation the following fall semester, which 
represents a decline from the prior year in 
the rate of immediate matriculation of new 
high school graduates to an institution of 
higher education; 
(3) the decline described in paragraph (2) 
was most notable among African American 
high school graduates, who faced a 20 percent 
decline from the prior year in immediate 
matriculation to an institution of higher 
education; and 
(4) the unemployment rate of adults with a 
bachelor’s degree and the unemployment 
rate of adults whose highest credential is a 
high school diploma differ by 20 percentage 
points, a gap that has grown larger as a re-
sult of COVID–19; 
Whereas the National Student Clearing-
house reports that undergraduate enrollment 
in colleges and universities is declining pre-
cipitously in the midst of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, particularly for nontraditional stu-
dents; 
Whereas the complexity of financial aid 
systems and rising college costs can serve as 
additional deterrents or barriers for students 
and families as they assess the viability of 
higher education programs as a postsec-
ondary option; 
Whereas many students struggle to iden-
tify and compare postsecondary options due 
to— 
(1) difficulties accessing school counseling 
services, which is evidenced by an esti-
mation of the American School Counselor 
Association that the student-to-counselor 
ratio in the United States is 430 to 1; 
(2) an absence of reliable programmatic 
and institutional outcome data; and 
(3) a lack of comparable and understand-
able college financial aid offers; 
Whereas, in addition to expanding out-
reach and support to recent high school 
graduates, colleges and universities must 
also expand outreach and support to all un-
dergraduate students; 
Whereas the Digest of Education Statistics 
for 2019 of the National Center for Education 
Statistics and the 2015–16 National Postsec-
ondary Student Aid Survey found that, of 
undergraduate 
students 
in 
the 
United 
States— 
(1) approximately 27 percent are older than 
25 years of age; 
(2) 38 percent are enrolled part-time; 
(3) 24 percent are parents; and 
(4) 86 percent live off-campus; 
Whereas the National Center for Education 
Statistics highlights that completion of the 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid is 
one of the best predictors of immediate col-
lege enrollment, as high school seniors who 
complete the form are 84 percent more likely 
to begin postsecondary education in the fall 
following high school graduation; 
Whereas applications for State-based fi-
nancial aid are available in many States for 
students who do not qualify for Federal stu-
dent aid; and 
Whereas the ongoing impact of the COVID– 
19 pandemic on communities, families, and 
educational 
systems 
across 
the 
United 
States underscores and reinforces the value 
of ensuring that all individuals, including 
students enrolled in high school and working 
adults— 
(1) understand their postsecondary options; 
(2) understand college financing opportuni-
ties; and 
(3) have support to navigate the college ap-
plication and financial aid processes: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2020 as ‘‘National 
College Application Month’’; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to— 
(A) evaluate options for pursuing higher 
education; 
(B) submit a Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid or an appropriate application 
for State-based financial aid in order to re-
ceive college financing opportunities; and 
(C) support every student, regardless of the 
background, age, or resources of the student,

FREIN V. DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and

agreed to: 
S. RES. 792 
Whereas, Senator Dianne Feinstein has 
been named as a defendant in the case of 
Chad Michael Frein v. Dianne Feinstein, Civil 
Action No. 20–CV–0252–LJV, currently pend-
ing in the United States District Court for

Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(1), the 
Senate may direct its counsel to defend 
Members of the Senate in civil actions relat-
ing to their official responsibilities: Now 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is 
authorized to represent Senator Feinstein in

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
behalf of myself and the distinguished

send to the desk a resolution author-
izing representation by the Senate 
Legal Counsel and ask for its imme-
diate consideration. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
resolution concerns a civil action pend-
ing in New York federal court against 
Senator FEINSTEIN. In this lawsuit, the 
pro se plaintiff asserts a jumble of con-
fusing allegations claiming that local 
government officials in California have 
assaulted him and taken his property. 
He appears to sue Senator FEINSTEIN 
because he wrote to her for assistance, 
and she did not take sufficient action 
to satisfy plaintiff. Plaintiff’s suit is 
subject to dismissal on jurisdictional 
grounds and failure to state a claim. 
This resolution would authorize the 
Senate Legal Counsel to represent Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN in order to seek dis-
missal of this suit. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 793—REMEM-
BERING THE DECEMBER 6, 2019, 
TERRORIST ATTACK AT NAVAL 
AIR STATION PENSACOLA AND 
COMMEMORATING 
THOSE 
WHO 
LOST THEIR LIVES, AND THOSE 
WHO 
WERE 
INJURED, 
IN 
THE 
LINE OF DUTY 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of 
Florida, Mr. PERDUE, Mr. JONES, Mr. 
SHELBY, and Mrs. LOEFFLER) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 793 
Whereas December 6, 2020, the 1-year anni-
versary of the terrorist attack at Naval Air 
Station Pensacola (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘terrorist attack’’), is a day of 
commemoration for those who lost their 
lives, and those who were injured, during the 
terrorist attack, including— 
(1) Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson of Enter-
prise, Alabama; 
(2) Aircrewman Third Class Mohammed 
Sameh Haitham of St. Petersburg, Florida; 
and 
(3) Aircrewman Third Class Cameron Scott 
Walters of Richmond Hill, Georgia; 
Whereas the 3 servicemembers who died in 
the terrorist attack were posthumously 
awarded the Purple Heart; 
Whereas the terrorist who committed the 
terrorist attack was a Saudi Arabian foreign 
military student who had been radicalized 
and established contacts with Al Qaeda 
operatives prior to attending flight training 
at Naval Air Station Pensacola; 
Whereas Naval Air Station Pensacola secu-
rity forces and Escambia County, Florida, 
law enforcement officers took decisive ac-
tion to end the terrorist attack and have 
rightly earned the praises and awards be-
stowed upon them; 
Whereas 2 civilians were awarded the De-
partment of the Navy Superior Civilian 
Medal for Valor for their heroic actions dur-
ing the terrorist attack; 
Whereas 7 individuals were awarded the 
Purple Heart, or the law enforcement equiva-
lent, for injuries sustained during the ter-
rorist attack; 
Whereas 9 military personnel were awarded 
the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for their 
heroic actions during the terrorist attack; 
Whereas 8 military personnel were awarded 
the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation 
Medal for their heroic actions during the ter-
rorist attack; 
Whereas 8 law enforcement officers were 
awarded the Medal of Valor for their actions 
taken during the terrorist attack; and 
Whereas December 6, 2020, marks 1 year 
since the lives of 3 military personnel were 
tragically cut short by the egregious act of 
terrorism at Naval Air Station Pensacola: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the December 6, 2019, ter-
rorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola 
(referred to in this resolution as the ‘‘ter-
rorist attack’’); 
(2) 
commemorates 
in 
sorrow 
the 
servicemembers and civilians who lost their 
lives, or who were injured, and the harm 
caused to the surrounding community, as a 
result of the terrorist attack; 
(3) remembers Ensign Joshua Kaleb Wat-
son, Aircrewman Third Class Mohammed 
Sameh Haitham, and Aircrewman Third 
Class Cameron Scott Walters, who were 
killed in the terrorist attack; 
(4) expresses gratitude for the heroic ac-
tions that the civilians, uniformed per-
sonnel, and law enforcement performed in 
the aftermath of the terrorist attack; 
(5) lauds the decision to give medals and 
awards to the law enforcement officers, uni-
formed servicemembers, and civilians who 
responded heroically on the morning of De-
cember 6, 2019; and 
(6) commends the efforts undertaken by 
the Department of Defense to enhance secu-
rity at military installations to ensure that 
the tragedy represented by the terrorist at-
tack is never repeated.

COMMISSION ON TRUTH, RACIAL 
HEALING, 
AND 
TRANS-
FORMATION 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. COONS, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, Ms. WARREN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. BROWN, and Mr. 
DURBIN) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 50 
Whereas the first ship carrying enslaved 
Africans to what is now known as the United 
States of America arrived in 1619; 
Whereas that event 400 years ago was sig-
nificant not only because it ushered in the 
institution of chattel slavery of African 
Americans, but also because it facilitated 
the systematic oppression of all people of 
color that has been a devastating and insuffi-
ciently understood and acknowledged aspect 
of our Nation’s history over those past 400 
years, and that has left a legacy of that op-
pression that haunts our Nation to this day; 
Whereas the institution of chattel slavery 
in the United States subjugated African 
Americans for nearly 250 years, fractured our 
Nation, and made a mockery of its founding 
principle that ‘‘all men are created equal’’; 
Whereas the signing of the Constitution of 
the United States failed to end slavery and 
oppressions against African Americans and 
other people of color, thus embedding in so-
ciety the belief in the myth of a hierarchy of 
human value based on superficial physical 
characteristics such as skin color and facial 
features, and resulting in purposeful and per-
sistent racial inequities in education, health 
care, employment, Social Security and vet-
eran benefits, land ownership, financial as-
sistance, food security, wages, voting rights, 
and the justice system; 
Whereas that oppression denied oppor-
tunity and mobility to African Americans 
and other people of color within the United 
States, resulting in stolen labor worth bil-
lions of dollars while ultimately forestalling 
landmark contributions that African Ameri-
cans and other people of color would make in 
science, arts, commerce, and public service; 
Whereas Reconstruction represented a sig-
nificant but constrained moment of advances 
for Black rights as epitomized by the Freed-
man’s Bureau, which negotiated labor con-
tracts for ex-enslaved people but failed to se-
cure their own land for them; 
Whereas the brutal overthrow of Recon-
struction failed all individuals in the United 
States by failing to ensure the safety and se-
curity 
of 
African 
Americans 
and 
by 
emboldening States and municipalities in 
both the North and South to enact numerous 
laws and policies to stymie the socio-
economic mobility and political voice of 
freed Blacks, thus maintaining their subser-
vience to Whites; 
Whereas Reconstruction, the civil rights 
movement, and other efforts to redress the

S7220 
December 3, 2020 
grievances of marginalized people were sabo-
taged, both intentionally and unintention-
ally, by those in power, thus rendering the 
accomplishments of those efforts transitory 
and unsustainable, and further embedding 
the racial hierarchy in society; 
Whereas examples of government actions 
directed against populations of color (re-
ferred to in this resolution as ‘‘discrimina-
tory government actions’’) include— 
(1) the creation of the Federal Housing Ad-
ministration, which adopted specific policies 
designed to incentivize residential segrega-
tion; 
(2) the enactment of legislation creating 
the Social Security program, for which most 
African Americans were purposely rendered 
ineligible during its first 2 decades; 
(3) the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 
1944 (commonly known as the ‘‘G.I. Bill of 
Rights’’; 58 Stat. 284, chapter 268), which left 
administration of its programs to the States, 
thus enabling blatant discrimination against 
African American veterans; 
(4) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
which allowed labor unions to discriminate 
based on race; 
(5) subprime lending aimed purposefully at 
families of color; 
(6) disenfranchisement of Native Ameri-
cans, who, until 1924, were denied citizenship 
on land Native Americans had occupied for 
millennia; 
(7) Federal Indian Boarding School policy 
during the 19th and 20th centuries, the pur-
pose of which was to ‘‘civilize’’ Native chil-
dren through methods intended to eradicate 
Native cultures, traditions, and languages; 
(8) land policies toward Indian Tribes, such 
as the allotment policy, which caused the 
loss of over 90,000,000 acres of Tribal lands, 
even though two-thirds of that acreage was 
guaranteed to Indian Tribes by treaties and 
other Federal laws, and similar unjustified 
land grabs from Indian Tribes that occurred 
regionally throughout the late 1800s and into 
the termination era in the 1950s and 1960s; 
(9) the involuntary removal of Mexicans 
and United States citizens of Mexican de-
scent through large-scale discriminatory de-
portation programs in the 1930s and 1950s; 
(10) the United States annexation of Puer-
to Rico, which made Puerto Ricans citizens 
of the United States without affording them 
voting rights; 
(11) racial discrimination against Latino 
Americans, which has forced Latino Ameri-
cans to fight continuously for equal access 
to employment, housing, health care, finan-
cial services, and education; 
(12) the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to execute 
certain treaty stipulations relating to Chi-
nese’’, approved May 6, 1892 (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Chinese Exclusion Act’’; 22 
Stat. 58, chapter 126), which effectively halt-
ed immigration from China and barred Chi-
nese immigrants from becoming citizens of 
the United States, and which was the first 
instance of xenophobic legislation signed 
into law specifically targeting a specific 
group of people based on ethnicity; 
(13) the treatment of Japanese Americans, 
despite no evidence of disloyalty, as suspect 
and traitorous in the very country they 
helped to build, leading most notably to the 
mass incarceration of Japanese Americans 
beginning in 1942; 
(14) the conspiracy to overthrow the King-
dom of Hawaii and annex the land of the 
Kingdom of Hawaii, without the consent of 
or compensation to the Native Hawaiian peo-
ple of Hawaii; and 
(15) the United States history of colo-
nialism in the Pacific, which has resulted in 
economic, health, and educational dispari-
ties among other inequities, for people in 
United States territories, as well as inde-
pendent nations with which the United 
States has treaty obligations; 
Whereas those discriminatory government 
actions, among other government policies 
that have had racially disparate impacts, 
have 
disproportionately 
barred 
African 
Americans and other people of color from 
building wealth, thus limiting potential cap-
ital and exacerbating the racial wealth gap; 
Whereas research has shown that the per-
sistent racial wealth gap has had a signifi-
cant negative impact on other racial dispari-
ties, such as the achievement gap, disparities 
in school dropout rates, income gaps, dis-
parities in home ownership rates, health out-
come disparities, and disparities in incarcer-
ation rates; 
Whereas United States civic leaders and 
foundations have spearheaded critical efforts 
to advance racial healing, understanding, 
and 
transformation 
within 
the 
United 
States, recognizing that it is in our collec-
tive national interest to urgently address 
the unhealed, entrenched divisions that will 
severely undermine our democracy if they 
are allowed to continue to exist; 
Whereas many of the most far-reaching 
victories for racial healing in the United 
States have been greatly enhanced by the in-
volvement, support, and dedication of indi-
viduals from any and all racial groups; 
Whereas at the same time, much of the 
progress toward racial healing and racial eq-
uity in the United States has been limited or 
reversed by our failure to address the root 
cause of racism, the belief in the myth of a 
hierarchy of human value based on super-
ficial physical characteristics such as skin 
color and facial features; 
Whereas the United States institution of 
slavery, as well as other examples enumer-
ated in this resolution, represent intentional 
and blatant violations of the most basic 
right of every individual in the United 
States to a free and decent life; 
Whereas the consequences of oppression 
against people of color have cascaded for 
centuries, across generations, beyond the era 
of active enslavement, imperiling for de-
scendants of slaves and other targets of op-
pression what should have otherwise been 
the right of every individual in the United 
States to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness; 
Whereas more than 40 countries have reck-
oned with historical injustice and its after-
math through forming Truth and Reconcili-
ation Commissions to move toward restora-
tive justice and to return dignity to their 
citizens; 
Whereas for 3 decades there has been a 
growing movement inside and outside Con-
gress to have the Federal Government de-
velop material remedies for the institution 
of slavery, including through a Commission 
to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals 
for African-Americans described in H.R. 40, 
116th Congress, as introduced on January 3, 
2019; 
Whereas the formation of a United States 
Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and 
Transformation does not supplant the forma-
tion of a Commission to Study and Develop 
Reparation Proposals for African-Americans, 
but rather complements that effort; and 
Whereas contemporary social science, med-
ical science, and the rapidly expanding use of 
artificial intelligence and social media re-
veal the costs and potential threats to our 
democracy if we continue to allow unhealed, 
entrenched divisions to be ignored and ex-
ploited: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) affirms, on the 400th anniversary of the 
arrival of the first slave ship to the United 
States, that the Nation owes a long-overdue 
debt of remembrance to not only those who 
lived through the egregious injustices enu-
merated in this resolution, but also to their 
descendants; and 
(2) urges the establishment of a United 
States Commission on Truth, Racial Heal-
ing, and Transformation to properly ac-
knowledge, memorialize, and be a catalyst 
for progress toward— 
(A) jettisoning the belief in a hierarchy of 
human value; 
(B) embracing our common humanity; and 
(C) permanently eliminating persistent ra-
cial inequities.

IIN HONOR OF DR. ANN ALBRIGHT 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Ann Albright, and to cele-
brate her extraordinary contributions to the di-
abetes community in light of her retirement. 
While I am saddened to see Dr. Albright 
leave the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, I know we are all eternally grateful 
for the time she has spent—both at the CDC, 
and throughout her career—as a national 
leader in the fight against diabetes. 
While at the CDC, she led the development 
and implementation of the National Diabetes 
Prevention Program—the nation’s top program 
working to prevent and delay the onset of type 
2 diabetes. 
Dr. Albright’s innovative approach to diabe-
tes prevention translated a well-established 
preventative care study into a successful, na-
tionwide program. Her work to expand access 
to diabetes care was unparalleled—she also 
spent time working with the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services to establish and im-
plement Medicare coverage for the National 
DPP lifestyle intervention program. 
Prior to her time at the CDC, Dr. Albright 
served as Chief of the California Diabetes Pro-
gram for the California Department of Health 
Services. She also served as President of 
Health Care and Education for the American 
Diabetes Association, Senior Health Policy Ad-
visor in the Office of the United States Sur-
geon General and led the Secretary of 
Health’s Diabetes Detection Initiative. 
I’m among the countless people who have 
been lucky enough to work alongside Dr. 
Albright as we search for innovative ways to 
treat and prevent diabetes. We appreciate her 
compassion and dedication in all her profes-
sional and community roles. Her spirit and en-
ergy have helped thousands of people across 
our country, and I know she will be sorely 
missed. 
I join with Dr. Albright’s colleagues, peers, 
and all those she has served throughout her 
career to thank her for her outstanding efforts 
to better the lives of others, and I wish her 
many happy years of retirement.

RECOGNIZING ALBERT GEORGE 
SIPKA 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. Albert George Sipka, of Warren, 
Ohio, who will soon celebrate his 100th birth-
day on December 12th. 
Albert was born to George and Susan Sipka 
in Duquesne, Pennslyvania in 1920. Albert 
was raised in Newton Falls, Ohio, which is lo-
cated in my Congressional District. He grad-
uated from Newtown Falls High School in 
1938. 
Mr. Sipka enlisted in the Navy on October 
16, 1942 and served until November of 1945. 
During his service, he served as a cook on a 
ship in the Pacific. Four of the six Sipka broth-
ers bravely served during World War II. Taking 
advantage of the GI Bill, Albert graduated from 
Kent State University in 1951 with a degree in 
Business Administration. 
Shortly before enlisting, Albert married the 
love of his life, Theresa Novak. They married 
on February 8, 1942 and had two children, Al-
bert and Elaine. He also has four grand-
children—Jessica, Donna, Albert, and Allison. 
Albert also took care of his dear Theresa dur-
ing her 15-year battle with Alzheimer’s. This 
show’s how serious Albert was to the vows of 
his marriage, his character, and his dedication 
to family. 
The majority of Albert’s working life was with 
General Motors, Packard Electric Division. 
During one period, when he was laid off from 
General Motors, he purchased a Dairy Queen 
in Windham, Ohio, and operated it for several 
years. 
Mr. Sipka is a great supporter of the Boy 
Scouts of America, having been active in 
scouting and taking numerous canoe trips to 
Canada over the years. Albert’s Christian faith 
is a deep aspect of his life. He has also en-
joyed traveling, snorkeling, canoeing, and gar-
dening. 
Albert contributes his long life to his family, 
having good and hard-working parents and 
five brothers that always got along. There is 
no doubt that Albert is a hard-worker and has 
enlisted this trait to his children and grand-
children. Mr. Sipka’s daughter-in-law, Diane, is 
my neighbor, and I am honored to wish him 
the happiest of birthdays. Please join me in 
congratulating Albert and his family for this 
milestone and thanking him for his service to 
our country.

OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ryan Bates and his years 
of distinguished service with Michigan United. 
His leadership and community impact are wor-
thy of commendation. 
Ryan Bates is the founding director of Michi-
gan United, a statewide coalition of 100 orga-
nizations that work together to achieve eco-
nomic, social, and racial justice in Michigan. In 
this capacity, Ryan has led the coalition to ex-
tend its mission statewide, encouraging all to 
use their voices to advocate for a just, equi-
table, and sustainable future. As a Michigan- 
native and graduate of the University of Michi-
gan, Ryan deeply understands the needs of 
the state community and has dedicated his ca-
reer to effecting positive change throughout 
the state. Previously, Ryan has been an orga-
nizer for the Michigan Raise the Wage Coali-
tion, Environment Michigan, and the Gamaliel 
Foundation. In addition, Ryan has overseen 
four successful Michigan State House races 
and worked with Reform Immigration for 
America across the Midwest. 
Throughout Michigan, Ryan Bates is recog-
nized as a humble, compassionate, and effec-
tive leader who strives to make a difference. 
He seeks to build bridges that unite commu-
nities and draw people together, and he has 
committed himself to fighting for a brighter fu-
ture for all. Ryan has been a strong voice for 
communities across Michigan and has brought 
critical awareness to significant issues affect-
ing the state. His leadership has made a last-
ing difference, and we are grateful for his 
years of dedicated service.

Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise

chael Crabtree, who passed from this Earth

Mike was a staple of the community, a dedi-

commitment to bettering our community were 
indisputable. 
Michael Crabtree was a true patriot who 
served in the US Army with the 82nd Airborne 
Division, then stayed engaged in many civic 
organizations, ultimately serving 18 years as 
County Commissioner. 
While Mike’s earthly mission is complete, 
his impact on Scioto County and all that knew 
him will be felt for generations as his legacy 
lives on. 
We are all forever grateful for his service 
and I will miss working with him. 
I ask for everyone to join me in praying for

HON. ANDY KIM

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Officer Sally Landrum. She is one of 
just twenty-three officers in our nation to re-
ceive the U.S. Attorney General’s Award for 
Distinguished Service in Community Policing. 
I, and the town of Willingboro, cannot be 
prouder of her. 
The Attorney General Award for Distin-
guished Service in Community Policing is 
given to exceptional officers who have gone 
above and beyond their call of duty to protect 
their communities, implementing ‘‘innovative 
community policing strategies, criminal inves-
tigations, and field operations that have prov-
en effective in enforcing our laws.’’ The Attor-
ney General could not have picked a better of-
ficer than Officer Landrum, who exemplifies 
good community policing. 
Officer Landrum has been a stalwart of the 
community. Throughout her time at the 
Willingboro 
Police 
Department, 
Officer 
Landrum has organized story times, toiletry 
drives for the homeless, a resiliency program 
for officers in distress, and elderly training pro-
grams. I commend Officer Landrum for her 
work, and I know I speak on behalf of my con-
stituents across Burlington and Ocean County

COMMEMORATING 
COMMISSIONER 
ED 
HUMPHREY’S 
SERVICE 
TO 
CLERMONT COUNTY 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to recognize Commissioner Ed Hum-
phrey for his years of tireless service and 
dedication to the Clermont County community 
as he is set to retire at the end of the year. 
Commissioner Humphrey has been a fixture of 
Clermont County for his entire life, and his 
service to our community has been felt for 
generations. 
Mr. Humphrey’s early volunteer work as a 
firefighter with the Miamiville Fire Department 
led to the development of the Life Squad on 
which he served as EMS Chief for 12 years. 
He went on to serve as Fire Chief from 1987 
to 1989 before transitioning to elected official 
to serve on the Miami Township Board of 
Trustees. 
During his time as trustee, Mr. Humphrey 
helped facilitate profound change in Miami 
Township. He improved Fire and EMS serv-
ices, police services, established a first-class 
park system, and more. 
Beyond his government roles, Mr. Hum-
phrey devoted countless hours to a variety of 
community programs: coaching youth sports, 
serving as President of the Clermont County 
Township Association and Chairperson of the 
Clermont County Health District Advisory 
Council, and joining his local masonic lodge, 
Milford Lodge 54 F. & A.M. 
It is a privilege to know Mr. Humphrey, not 
only because of his incredible service to our 
community, but also as a friend. He has led a 
life of service devoted to his commitment to 
leave his community better than he found it. 
I wish Mr. Humphrey the best on his well- 
deserved retirement. I know I can speak on 
behalf of myself and the Clermont County 
community when I say we are grateful for his 
many years of service.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. RUPERT 
LEWIS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Rupert Lewis as he de-
livers the keynote speech at The PuLSE Insti-
tute Literary Circle Forum. Dr. Lewis’s signifi-
cant academic achievements are worthy of 
commendation. 
Dr. Rupert Lewis is Professor Emeritus of 
Political Thought in the Department of Govern-
ment at the University of the West Indies, Ja-
maica. He is a scholar of the Garvey move-
ment and Caribbean radicalism in the twen-
tieth and twenty-first centuries, and he holds 
years of experience lecturing political science, 
political thought in the Caribbean, and African 
and global politics. Currently, Dr. Lewis is a 
research fellow in the PJ Patterson Centre for 
Africa-Caribbean Advocacy at the UWI, work-
ing alongside Jamaican Prime Minister PJ 
Paterson to strengthen the relationship be-
tween the Caribbean and Africa. 
Dr. Lewis is recognized globally as a lead-
ing academic in political thought. He has pub-
lished a host of essays and biographies that 
have propelled the academic discipline for-
ward and have been formative in scholars’ un-
derstanding of politics in the Caribbean. Be-
yond academics, Dr. Lewis is an activist for 
reparative justice and has earned the Order of 
Distinction, Commander class honor from the 
Government of Jamaica for his efforts. Dr. 
Lewis’s selection to deliver the keynote 
speech underscores his wide expertise and 
exemplifies his commitment to enhancing 
awareness of the Caribbean’s impacts on the 
global community. As the United States cele-
brates the election of Vice President-elect 
Kamala Harris, the first Black woman of Ja-
maican descent to assume the vice presi-
dency, Dr. Lewis will provide valuable insight 
of the Caribbean’s many contributions to 
United States politics and how it continues to 
shape American political life today. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Rupert Lewis as he deliv-
ers the keynote speech at The PuLSE Institute 
Literary Circle Forum. Dr. Lewis’s academic 
expertise continues to make a difference, and 
his testimony will enhance our community’s 
understanding of the role the Caribbean has 
played within our own nation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
ZACHARY JACOB ‘‘ZAC’’ PLANTZ 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of my dedicated staff member 
and friend, Zachary Jacob ‘‘Zac’’ Plantz. His 
life was tragically taken in a car accident on 
November 26th at the age of 27. Zac was an 
incredibly gifted young man who had immeas-
urable potential and the ability to bring joy to 
others. He loved his family, served his com-
munity, and was passionate about helping 
people. 
A Frankfort native and lifelong Chicago loy-
alist, Zac was a proud graduate of Providence 
Catholic High School and the University of 
Notre Dame where he played for the Fighting 
Irish rugby team. After college, Zac began his 
career as a successful consultant, but found a 
new sense of purpose in pursuing his true 
passion for public service. In 2018, Zac began 
his political career by coordinating a Chicago 
mayoral campaign for Jerry Joyce, Jr. Last 
year, I brought Zac into my campaign and 
quickly learned what a gifted young man he 
was. Before long, he became my Campaign 
Manager. After the campaign, Zac joined my 
congressional staff as a Senior Policy Advisor. 
During his time in my office, he demonstrated 
a great ability to bring people together and 
make a difference in the lives of constituents 
in Illinois’s 3rd Congressional District. Zac’s 
contagious energy and ability to lift people up 
was nothing short of remarkable. 
Though Zac had many career accomplish-
ments in his short life, he also demonstrated 
his exceptional character through charitable 
endeavors. For the past six years, Zac ran 
sixty miles in November to raise money for 
Movember, a charitable organization dedicated 
to improving men’s mental health. His efforts 
through this organization will have a lasting 
impact on countless lives. 
Zac was a friend to so many of us and I ex-
tend my heartfelt condolences to Zac’ s loving 
parents Ron and Laura, his siblings Logan, 
Tyler, and Abby, his longtime girlfriend Kath-
leen, and all of Zac’s family and friends. While 
his journey on Earth might be over, his legacy 
will live on in the advice he gave, the stories 
he told, and the people he brought together. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Zachary ‘‘Zac’’ 
Plantz. He was a man who lived his life for 
others and brought joy into the world. I know 
that Zac’s passion and commitment to his 
family, friends, and community will have a last-
ing impact on all of us.

TRIBUTE TO FORMER REPRESENT-
ATIVE ROBERT FREEMAN ‘‘BOB’’ 
SMITH 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life of former Representa-
tive Robert Freeman ‘‘Bob’’ Smith. 
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my 
friend and former colleague and offer my 
deepest condolences to his friends and family. 
I served with Bob in Congress for a decade. 
He spent his life serving Oregonians in various 
roles, including president of the Public Lands 
Council, and in the Oregon legislature as 
House Speaker and subsequently Senate Mi-
nority Leader. He dedicated his life to his com-
munity, his constituents, and all Oregonians. 
Growing up in Burns, he worked as a ranch-
er. His experiences provided a deep knowl-
edge of the needs and concerns of rural Or-
egonians, and he was one of their fiercest ad-
vocates. Bob was also a man of principle. He 
retired from Congress in 1995, yet ran again 
in 1997 because his successor, a member of 
his own party, had lied about his military serv-
ice, among many other problems. He won, 
and when he returned to Congress for what 
would be his last term, he was elected Chair-
man of the House Agriculture Committee, 
placing him in a powerful role championing 
policies important to rural communities. 
Make no mistake, Bob and I had policy dis-
agreements, but we were always friends and 
worked together often. One of my fondest 
memories is when Bob and I worked along-
side former Senator Mark Hatfield to designate 
the Newberry Crater as a Monument in order 
to protect the area from energy development. 
Though we came from different sides of the 
aisle, this designation effort was just one ex-
ample of how we were able to come together 
as Oregonians to protect the people, re-
sources, and great outdoors that make Or-
egon home. Bob is missed, but his life of serv-
ice and inspiring legacy lives on.
