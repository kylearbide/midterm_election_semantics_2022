PRAYER 
Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran 
Church of the Reformation, Wash-
ington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
God our shepherd, You provide all we 
need: green pasture, safe waters, and 
protected paths. Even though we move 
through the valley of the shadow of 
death, we shall fear no evil, You are 
with us, You protect and comfort us. 
Thank You for the shepherds among 
us, especially for healthcare workers 
whose care for others puts them at 
risk. Grant them wisdom, clarity and 
rest. 
When our anxiety about disease turns 
into fear of our neighbors, forgive us. 
When fear constricts our hearts and 
compassion dries up, renew us. When 
exhaustion and scarcity cloud our judg-
ment, lead us. 
Encourage us to protect those most 
vulnerable, especially those who are 
sick, isolated, imprisoned, unemployed, 
or without shelter. 
Shepherd the House of Representa-
tives. Guide the Members along right 
pathways. Always alert to the reality 
of the threats facing us, give our lead-
ers calm assurance and abiding trust in 
You. 
Amen.

March 23, 2020 
By Mrs. LOWEY: 
H.R. 6379. 
Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following: 
The principal constitutional authority for 
this legislation is clause 7 of section 9 of ar-
ticle I of the Constitution of the United 
States (the appropriation power), which 
states: 
‘‘No Money shall be drawn from the Treas-
ury, but in Consequence of Appropriations 
made by Law . . .’’ 
In addition, clause 1 of section 8 of article 
I of the Constitution (the spending power) 
provides: 
‘‘The Congress shall have the Power . . . to 
pay the Debts and provide for the common 
Defense and general Welfare of the United 
States . . .’’ 
Together, these specific constitutional pro-
visions establish the congressional power of 
the purse, granting Congress the authority 
to appropriate funds, to determine their pur-
pose, amount, and period of availability, and 
to set forth terms and conditions governing 
their use.

WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2020 
No. 57 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Heavenly Father, give our lawmakers 
wisdom and spiritual eyes to see You 
at work. Remind them that, in every-
thing, You are working for the good of 
those who love You. 
Guide our Senators to strive to 
please You by living blameless, holy, 
and disciplined lives. 
As they battle this coronavirus pan-
demic, 
may 
they 
not 
forget 
the 
marginalized. 
Lord, give our lawmakers a hunger 
for Your words and a desire to apply 
Your knowledge in their daily work. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
eyes of the Nation are on the Senate. 
For days now, we have been engaged in 
intense, bipartisan talks to build emer-
gency relief legislation on a historic 
scale, 
to 
push 
resources 
to 
our 
healthcare heroes and American work-
ers and families. 
Democrats and Republicans sat down 
together. We crafted this version of a 
proposal together. This compromise 
package would push tens of billions of 
dollars to hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders. It would send direct checks to 
millions of American households—di-
rect checks. It would massively expand 
unemployment insurance in this crisis. 
It would stabilize industries to prevent 
mass layoffs. And, crucially, it would 
deliver historic relief to small busi-
nesses to help Main Street employees 
from being totally crushed—crushed— 
by this pandemic. 
But, yesterday, when the time came 
to vote on these urgent measures, our 
Democratic colleagues chose to block 
it. So why are the American people 
still waiting? It is a good question to 
ask. I hear the markets are not doing 
well today. They would like to ask the 
question of us: Why not move? Why are 
Democrats filibustering the bipartisan 
bill they helped write? 
It is an appropriate question to ask 
this morning as the country waits on 
us. So let me give the American people 
a taste of the outstanding issues we 
woke up to this morning. Here are 
some of the items on the Democratic 
wish list over which they chose to 
block this legislation last night: tax 
credits for solar energy and wind en-
ergy, provisions to force employers to 
give special new treatment to Big 
Labor, and—listen to this—new emis-
sions standards for the airlines. 
Are you kidding me? This is the mo-
ment to debate new regulations that 
have nothing whatsoever to do with 
this crisis? That is what they are up to 
over there. The American people need 
to know it. 
Democrats will not let us fund hos-
pitals or save small businesses unless 
they get to dust off the Green New 
Deal. I would like to see Senate Demo-
crats tell New York City doctors and 
nurses who are literally overrun as we 
speak that they are filibustering hos-
pital funding and more masks because 
they want to argue with the airlines 
over their carbon footprint. 
I would like to see Senate Democrats 
tell small business employees in their 
States, who are literally being laid off 
every day, that they are filibustering 
relief that will keep people on the pay-
roll because Democrats’ special inter-
est friends want to squeeze employers 
while 
they 
are 
vulnerable—squeeze 
these employers while they are vulner-
able. 
I would like to see Senate Democrats 
tell all the American seniors who have 
seen their hard-earned retirement sav-
ings literally melt away, as the mar-
kets track toward their worst month 
since 1931, that they are continuing to 
hold up emergency measures over tax 
credits for solar panels—tax credits for 
solar panels. 
Even with the Federal Reserve an-
nouncing even further extraordinary 
steps today, the markets are tanking 
once again, as I said, because this body 
can’t get its act together, and the only 
reason it can’t get its act together is 
right over here on the other side of the 
aisle. 
So these are just a few of the com-
pletely nongermane wish list items 
that they are rallying behind, pre-
venting us from getting this emergency 
relief to the American people right 
now, eleventh-hour demands the Demo-
crats have decided are more important 
than Americans’ paychecks and the 
personal safety of doctors and nurses. 
So remember what one of Speaker 
PELOSI’s top lieutenants in the House 
said a few days ago—and this is a di-
rect quote: This is a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restrict things to fit our vi-
sion—to fit our vision. That was the 
Democratic whip in the House, just 
laying it out there. It reminds me of 
the definition of a Washington gaffe: 
when a politician in Washington tells 
you what he really means. 
We heard something similar here on 
the Senate floor last night—just last 
night. Here was one of our Democratic

S1920 
March 23, 2020 
colleagues: ‘‘How many times are we 
going to get a shot at a trillion-dollar- 
plus program?’’ Right here on the floor 
last night: ‘‘I don’t know how many 
trillion-plus packages we are going to 
have.’’ In other words, let’s don’t waste 
this opportunity to take full advantage 
and get our whole wish list done. 
They ought to be embarrassed. In 
fact, I have heard from some of them 
who are embarrassed, talking like this 
is some juicy political opportunity. 
This is not a juicy political oppor-
tunity. This is a national emergency. 
We had days of productive, bipartisan 
talks to get to this point. Senate 
Democrats sat down with Senate Re-
publicans and negotiated furiously to 
get to this point. The bill now contains 
a huge number of changes that our 
Democratic colleagues requested, in-
cluding major changes. We were this 
close—this close. 
Then, yesterday morning, the Speak-
er of the House flew back from San 
Francisco, and suddenly the Senate’s 
serious bipartisan process turned into 
this leftwing episode of ‘‘Supermarket 
Sweep’’—unrelated 
issues, 
left 
and 
right. 
I will tell you what would really 
lower our carbon footprint. If the en-
tire economy continues to crumble, 
with 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
more 
Americans laid off because Senate 
Democrats will not let us act, that will 
lower our carbon footprint all right. 
Every 
single 
American 
outside 
of 
Washington knows this is no time for 
this nonsense. 
A surgeon in Fresno, CA, says: ‘‘We 
are at war with no ammo.’’ ‘‘We are at 
war with no ammo.’’ That is a surgeon 
in Fresno. An intensive care nurse in 
New York City says: ‘‘If we don’t get 
the proper equipment soon, we’re going 
to get sick.’’ 
Democrats are filibustering more 
masks and aid for hospitals. Every day, 
more Americans wake up to the news 
that their jobs are gone—their jobs are 
gone. Democrats are filibustering pro-
grams to keep people on the payroll, 
and they are filibustering a huge ex-
pansion of unemployment insurance, 
which they themselves negotiated and 
put into the bill. Hundreds of dollars 
extra per week for laid-off workers on 
top of existing unemployment benefits, 
and Democrats are blocking it? 
This has to stop, and today is the day 
it has to stop. The country is out of 
time—out of time. When the Demo-
cratic House passed their phase 2 bill, 
even though Senate Republicans would 
have written it very differently, we 
sped it through the Senate and passed 
it quickly without even amending it. I 
literally told my colleagues to ‘‘gag 
and vote for it,’’ for the sake of build-
ing bipartisan momentum, because Re-
publicans understand that a national 
crisis calls for urgency and it calls for 
bipartisanship. 
It is time for that good faith to be re-
ciprocated. It is time for Democrats to 
stop playing politics and step up to the 
plate. The small businesses in their 
own States deserve it. Their own 
States’ emergency room doctors de-
serve it. Their own constituents who 
have lost their jobs deserve it. 
In my home State of Kentucky, the 
Governor has effectively paused com-
merce across the State, and our unem-
ployment system crashed due to de-
mand. Kentuckians need help now, and 
we aren’t alone. I have heard the pleas 
from healthcare workers in New York 
and Seattle. I have listened to the 
small business owners crying out in 
Brooklyn and Chicago. 
Why does only one side understand 
that this is urgent? Why are these 
hard-hit cities’ own Senators happy to 
keep this slow-walking going on indefi-
nitely? Is that really something these 
folks on the other side are comfortable 
with—indefinitely slow-walking all of 
this? How can half the Senate not rise 
to the occasion? At a time when every-
body else in the country is pulling to-
gether, they are pulling us apart. 
The examples are all over the coun-
try 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
look 
to: 
healthcare heroes, to neighborhood vol-
unteers, to national industries. Every-
body is unifying and pitching in. What 
about here in the Senate? 
It is time to get with the program. It 
is time to pass historic relief that we 
have 
built 
together. 
The 
country 
doesn’t have time for these political 
games. They need progress. 
So we are going to vote in just a few 
minutes, and I assure you the Amer-
ican people will be watching. 
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

jection is heard.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, every 
time we hear the majority leader come 
out, it is a partisan screed. I am in my 
office with the President’s Secretary of 
Treasury, the President’s congressional 
liaison, getting things done. We Demo-
crats are trying to get things done, not 
making partisan speech after partisan 
speech. 
In the past 24 hours, we got word that 
a Member of this Chamber, Senator 
PAUL, 
has 
tested 
positive 
for 
coronavirus, and the husband of an-
other Member, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
also tested positive. He is in the hos-
pital. I want to let them know—both of 
them—that the Senate is thinking of 
them and praying for their speedy re-
covery, as we are for tens of thousands 
of American families who are con-
fronting the same situation right now. 
Whether you are afraid for a sick 
family member, an older relative in the 
hospital, or struggling without work, 
income, or the knowledge of when your 
isolation might end, our thoughts are 
with you right now. These are trying 
times for all of us, but the scourge of 
this disease will pass. The American 
people, as always, will prevail. 
As the number of confirmed COVID– 
19 cases in the United States eclipses 
35,000, the Senate continues to nego-
tiate what will likely be the largest 
emergency funding bill in American 
history. As I have mentioned, we have 
had 
almost 
continuous 
discussions 
with Secretary Mnuchin. He left my of-
fice at about 12:15 last night and was 
there at about 9 o’clock this morning. 
The White House congressional liaison, 
Eric Ueland, has been in and out of the 
office as well. We are very close to 
reaching a deal—very close. Our goal is 
to reach a deal today, and we are hope-
ful, even confident, that we will meet 
that goal. 
We have been working on a few out-
standing issues that are no surprise to 
everyone. From the very beginning, 
Democrats have insisted on a Marshall 
Plan for our medical system, more 
money for hospitals, community health 
centers, nursing homes, and urgent 
medical supplies, such as gloves and 
masks, ICU beds, testing kits, ventila-
tors, and PPE. Since our negotiations, 
the numbers have gone up dramatically 
because 
the 
hospitals 
and 
our 
healthcare workers need the help. 
We are fighting hard and making 
progress on funding for State and local 
governments. They are propping up 
local healthcare networks virtually on 
their own. Their revenues are dramati-
cally declining. Many towns and vil-
lages across America—the smaller ones 
in particular—might go broke pretty 
soon if we do nothing. If we can help 
the big corporations, we can help our 
local towns and villages and the tax-
payers they represent. 
On unemployment insurance, the bill 
has moved in the direction we have 
outlined. The original bill has the 
unexpanded employment benefits last 
only 3 months. We need to make it 
longer because the dislocation caused 
by this crisis will not be over in 90 
days, and people who lose their jobs 
need help. It says to every American 
who loses his or her job—the Demo-
cratic plan that is now in the bill: You 
will get your full pay from the Federal 
Government. You can be furloughed by 
your employer. That means you will 
keep your benefits, health and other-
wise. And it means that you will be

able to come back, and the business 
you had to leave can reassemble itself 
quickly after, God willing, this crisis 
ends. 
The bill still includes something that 
most Americans don’t want to see: 
large corporate bailouts with almost 
no strings attached. Maybe the major-
ity leader thinks it is unfair to have 
protections for workers and labor to 
companies that are getting hundreds of 
billions of dollars. We think it is very 
fair to ask for those. Those are not ex-
traneous issues. That is a wish list for 
workers—nobody else. 
We are looking for protection. We are 
looking for oversight. If this Federal 
Government is making a big loan to 
someone—to a big company, we ought 
to know it and know the details imme-
diately. The bill that was put on the 
floor by the Republican leader said no 
one would know a thing about those 
loans for 6 months at least. In those so- 
called bailouts, we need to protect 
workers—the workers those industries 
employ. 
We have been guided by one plan: 
workers first. That is the name of our 
proposal. The bill needs to reflect that 
priority. 
We are working on all of these items 
in good faith as we speak, and we hope 
and expect to conclude negotiations 
today. This vote the Senate—it is no 
surprise—is about to take is merely a 
repeat of the vote that failed last 
night. Leader MCCONNELL continues to 
set arbitrary vote deadlines when the 
matter of real importance is the status 
of the bipartisan negotiations. 
Let me be clear. The upcoming proce-
dural votes are essentially irrelevant. 
The negotiations continue no more 
than 30 feet away from the floor of the 
Senate in our offices, where the real 
progress is taking place. Once we have 
an agreement that everyone can get be-
hind, we are prepared to speed up the 
consideration of that agreement on the 
floor. So I am going to get back to ne-
gotiations. 
We all know time is of the essence. 
The country is facing twin crises in our 
healthcare system and in our economy. 
We have an obligation to get the de-
tails right and get them done quickly. 
That doesn’t mean blindly accepting a 
Republican-only bill. That was the bill 
we were given. There were lots of 
things we didn’t even know about on 
Saturday. That means working to 
make this bill better—better for our 
small businesses, better for our work-
ing families, better for our healthcare 
system. 
Democrats—Democrats—will 
not 
stop working with our Republican 
counterparts until we get the job done. 
I will continue to update the Senate on 
the progress of our negotiations. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the quorum 
call be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I object. I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader’s objection is heard. 
Ms. COLLINS. This is unbelievable. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senator from Maine 
be allowed to speak for a few minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is in a quorum call. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I object.

Mr. CASSIDY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I would simply like 
to know for the sake of the Members— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is in a quorum call. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak for 30 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. RISCH. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is in a quorum call. 
Is there an objection to removing the 
quorum call? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to removing the quorum 
call? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
no right to reserve the right to object. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I have the floor. I 
would ask— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, you 
do not. 
The Senate is in a quorum call. You 
have to ask that the quorum call— 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I would simply like 
to ask the leader—before we have these 
speeches, because we were supposed to 
vote for the next time after he and I 
spoke—what is the schedule for the 
rest of the day? 
Will he respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it is 
my understanding that they are going 
to let us voice vote this. 
Mr. SCHUMER. We have no objection 
to voice voting the first two and then 
would like to vote, if the leader wants, 
now on the third, and then we can have 
the speeches. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. What you are pro-
posing is that we voice vote two, and 
then the cloture vote occurs automati-
cally? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 
correct. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Parliamentary in-
quiry: Does the cloture vote occur— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The 
cloture vote pops and occurs third 
automatically. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I propose we voice 
vote the first two and then pause so 
that there are some speeches allowed 
by Members—up to an hour of speeches 
allowed by Members before the cloture 
vote. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I have no objection 
to that. As long as we have a schedule, 
I have no objection to that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The un-
derstanding of the Chair is that there 
will be voice votes on the first two mo-
tions, and then there will be an hour of 
debate equally divided. There will be 
an hour of debate prior to a vote on the 
cloture motion upon reconsideration. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Equally divided? An 
hour on both sides? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. That is fine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The un-
derstanding of the Chair is that the re-
quest is that the hour of debate would 
be equally divided prior to the cloture 
vote on the motion to proceed. 
The majority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1922 
March 23, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The vote will be 30 minutes in length. 
It is so ordered. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are 
in the midst of a crisis in our country— 
a crisis caused by the coronavirus. I 
cannot believe that the answer to this 
crisis from our friends on the other 
side of the aisle, as we move to address 
the economic consequences that are so 
severe for the people of this country, is 
delay, delay, delay; no sense of ur-
gency; no hurry. 
I will tell you, I have had the honor 
to serve in this body for many years. 
Never—never—have I seen Republicans 
and Democrats fail to come together 
when confronted with a crisis. We did 
so after 9/11. We did so with the finan-
cial meltdown in 2008. Here, we are fac-
ing an enemy that is invisible but 
equally devastating to the health of 
our people and to the health of our 
economy. Yet, unbelievably, the Demo-
cratic leader objected to my even being 
able to speak this morning. Is that 
what we have come to? The Democratic 
leader objected to our convening at 9 
o’clock this morning so that we could 
begin working in earnest. Is that what 
we have come to? 
The fact is, we have been working on 
a bipartisan effort through task force, 
with both Republicans and Democrats, 
making very good progress and putting 
together a comprehensive package— 
the third package we have dealt with. 
This one is to address and prevent the 
economic devastation that is being 
caused by this virus. 
We don’t have another day. We don’t 
have another hour. We don’t have an-
other minute to delay acting. I have 
talked with businesses all over my 
State—small mom-and-pop businesses, 
like a diner, a third-generation diner 
operated by the Simones family in 
Lewiston, ME. For the first time ever, 
they have had to close their doors. As 
Linda Simones told me through tears 
yesterday: This is the first time ever 
we have been unemployed. Our son is 
unemployed. Our friends who have 
worked with us at this diner for years 
are unemployed. 
We have a very good plan that we 
worked on in a bipartisan way—Sen-
ator MARCO RUBIO and I on the Repub-
lican side and Senators BEN CARDIN and 
JEANNE SHAHEEN, in very good faith, on 
the Democratic side—that would help 
these small businesses and keep their 
employees paid. It would keep their 
employees getting paychecks. How can 
that possibly be controversial? 
How can any of us want to see mil-
lions of Americans lose their pay-
checks, their health insurance, their 
contributions 
to 
their 
retirement 
plans? We have a package that is part 
of this broader legislation. 
As the majority leader pointed out 
just yesterday, had we invoked cloture, 
that is not the end of the process. 
There still could have been 30 hours for 
us to refine this package. 
Keep in mind that every single one of 
these task forces have been bipartisan. 
Do we agree on everything? Of course 
not, but surely, surely, in this time of 
extreme crisis for our country—when 
people are getting sick, when people 
are dying from the coronavirus, when 
we are facing unemployment rates 
which could go as high as 20 percent, 
according to the Treasury Secretary— 
surely, we ought to be able to pull to-
gether and work quickly to respond to 
the needs of the American people. 
I cannot believe the objections to 
proceeding to this package. Is this 
package perfect? No. That is why nego-
tiations are still going on. 
Don’t we want to act quickly to pro-
vide relief to the American workers? 
This is disgraceful. We do not have 
time. Time is not on our side. Let’s get 
the job done for the American people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
because my dear friend, I can tell, is 
very upset. I am upset that we are at 
this point. I really am. I am working 
with you on so many things in a bipar-
tisan way. I always have and always 
will. 
With that being said, let me make 
sure of this. I haven’t been here as long 
as you have and haven’t the experience 
that you have. The way I understand 
it, voting for cloture takes a 60-vote 
threshold, except for the judges, which, 
basically, the previous leader, Senator 
Harry Reid from Nevada, changed. I 
was opposed to that. We are in a situa-
tion now where, if you vote yes on clo-
ture and then you are not in agreement 
with the bill, it only takes 51 votes. 
That seems to be the reason everyone 
is saying: Wait a minute. Let’s get an 
agreement so we can move it through. 
That is what I always heard and that 
is what I understand. They are afraid, 
basically, that if you vote for cloture— 
even though it is not the things you 
want or have been negotiated on—then 
the vote is 51, even with the 30 hours of 
curing. Then, it goes from there, and, 
then, we are back to where we have not 
had any negotiations because the ma-
jority has the control with 51 votes. 
That is what I think the fear is here. 
The problem we have in West Vir-
ginia right now is that you can throw 
all the money at Wall Street that you 
want to. You can continue to put tril-
lions upon trillions there. People are 
afraid to leave their home. They are 
afraid because they are afraid of the 
healthcare. I have workers who don’t 
have masks. I have healthcare workers 
who don’t have gowns. I have hospitals 
that will not be open another 60 days 
because they don’t have cash flow. It 
looks like we are worried more about 
the economy than the healthcare and 
well-being of the people. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Will the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Yes, sir. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Even if cloture 
were invoked, there are 30 more hours. 
Mr. MANCHIN. We know about the 30 
more hours. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask the Senator 
from West Virginia, in what way would 
your side be disadvantaged by that? 
The American people are waiting for 
us to act today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Senator COLLINS 
has laid it out. We don’t have time for 
this. We don’t have time for it. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Let me ask you a 
question. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I have a question. 
In what way would the Democratic mi-
nority be disadvantaged? 
Mr. DURBIN. Who has control of the 
floor? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia has the floor. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Sir, anything I am 
saying—30 hours or 30 days—as long as 
you have the majority, 51 votes rule. 
The final vote is going to be on pas-
sage, whether you have to negotiate or 
not with us. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. By firming a deal, 
we have to get cloture again once we 
got on the bill. In other words, this is 
cloture on the motion to proceed to the 
bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Let me explain it 
to my good friend from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I understand. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Here is the way it 
works, colleagues. We have been fid-
dling around, as the Senator from 
Maine pointed out, for 24 hours. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia has the floor. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I know where you are 
coming from on this. We have a little 
difference of opinion about this. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I thank the Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Colleagues, here is 
an understanding of where we are. We 
have been fiddling around for 2 days on 
the motion to proceed. 
Mr. MANCHIN. If I could make my 
remarks. 
Mr. DURBIN. Who has the floor? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. My friend, if that 
were invoked, there are still 30 more 
hours postcloture on the motion to 
proceed. 
Once you get on the bill, you have to 
go through it again. There is no way in 
which— 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. We should be able to 
get a bill that we can move forward on 
with unanimous consent. We really 
should. That is what I am hoping for. I 
think we can do it. 
Let me go back to where I am coming 
from. My whole thing is based on the

March 23, 2020 
healthcare right now. You can’t throw 
enough money to fix this if you can’t 
fix the healthcare. If you can’t give my 
people in West Virginia and across this 
country the feeling that we have a 
treatment and we are moving forward 
on a vaccine, they are not leaving their 
homes. My restaurants aren’t going to 
open up. 
The most important thing is, How do 
we take care of the workers who have 
lost their jobs through no fault of their 
own because businesses have closed? It 
is the same in my State as in your 
State—through no fault of their own. 
That is the package we have to get out. 
We have $160 billion moving right 
now—moving right now. 
I am saying this: It looks like things 
are weighted toward the Wall Street 
corporations’ side. True or false? 
We are not in the frontlines. We are 
not one of the big four. 
Many of us—100 of us—are not there 
negotiating at the table. Our staffs are 
all having input, and we are working 
on that. But sitting there and making 
the final decisions comes down to this: 
Can we give the confidence that we can 
rise to the occasion to keep the people 
healthy in our States? My hospitals 
need to stay open. My healthcare work-
ers need to be healthy. They need to be 
protected. 
It seems like we are talking about 
everything else about the economy 
versus the healthcare. That doesn’t 
make any sense to me whatsoever. 
For the people who aren’t getting a 
check right now, we can get a check to 
them. We should. 
It seems like we are more focused on 
the big corporations and the healthcare 
of Wall Street than we are on the 
healthcare of the people in rural Amer-
ica and Main Street. That is the prob-
lem I have had on this. That is the 
problem we have been talking about. 
We want to fix this. I am not talking 
about all the regulations you are talk-
ing about. I don’t know anything about 
that. I will find out if it is buried in the 
bill and it is not what I would approve 
right now if we don’t need it. But if you 
are giving all of the preferences to the 
large corporations, they can shill and 
hide and do buybacks and everything 
else. Don’t you think the American 
worker ought to get something or be 
protected in some way? That is what it 
is like. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as 
the majority leader said, all this vote 
is about is, Shall we get on the bill? 
Can we debate the issue? Can we get to-
gether to decide what to do about what 
is the most significant healthcare cri-
sis in a century in this State? Can we 
get on the bill? We are saying yes; they 
are saying no. 
The distinguished Senator from West 
Virginia says: What about the people 
who need help? I have a friend who 
emailed me last night and said: It is 
too late; I am closing five small busi-
nesses. 
These are little businesses. 
Well, why did we not vote last night 
on this, because in this bill is the pro-
posal by Senator COLLINS—Senator 
COLLINS, Republican; Senator CARDIN, 
Democrat; Senator RUBIO, Republican; 
Senator 
SHAHEEN, 
Democrat—that 
would loan money to small businesses 
of less than 500 people so they can pay 
their employees in West Virginia and 
Tennessee. And then, if they did that, 
it would be forgiven. In other words, it 
is a grant. They could keep working. 
That is for the employees. Every day 
we wait, they don’t get paid. 
Pass this bill and the laid-off employ-
ees would be available for sick leave, 
which they weren’t when the bill came 
over from the House. Pass this bill 
today and the employee who was laid 
off last week could be available for 2 
weeks of sick leave at today’s salary. 
Pass this bill and most Americans 
would get $1,200 per person, $2,400 a 
couple, $500 more for a child. They 
would get it one day sooner if you 
passed this bill last night. 
These are not controversial pro-
posals. On the Collins-Rubio-Cardin- 
Shaheen proposal, I happened to be 
watching Robert Reich, the former 
Labor Secretary for President Clinton, 
who is about as far to the left as any-
body goes, and someone asked him: 
What would be the single best thing 
Congress could do to help workers get 
their money and be paid? 
He said it is exactly what the Collins- 
Rubio-Cardin-Shaheen proposal would 
do—loan money to those with 500 or 
less and let them keep working. 
As for this business about big cor-
porations, Darden is a big corporation. 
It owns lots of restaurants. Gaylord is 
a big corporation. It owns Opryland. If 
it has a credit problem and the Federal 
Reserve Board can make sure that it 
has enough money to stay in business, 
all the people who work at the Grand 
Ole Opry can continue to have jobs. If 
they don’t, they will be out of work. 
What is wrong with that? 
I mean, that is the goal. Whether you 
work for a big company or a little com-
pany, you are still an American cit-
izen—whether you work for FedEx or 
the local diner. 
And as far as solving the problem of 
the disease—and then I will let others 
speak—pass this bill and 1 day sooner 
we would have $10 billion to accelerate 
treatments. Treatments are what we 
need. We could accelerate vaccines. 
Vaccines are what we eventually need. 
Pass this bill and we would have $75 
billion for hospitals and $10 billion for 
those diagnostic treatments I just 
mentioned. We would have $1.7 billion 
to buy more masks. 
All of that could happen 1 day sooner 
if the other side wasn’t trying to at-
tach its political agenda to a crisis bill. 
This is no time to be running a polit-
ical campaign. 
As the majority leader said, the 
House—dominated by Democrats—sent 
us their ideas. We passed it through 
without a single amendment, even 
though we didn’t agree with many of 
their ideas. We worked for days with 
our counterparts on the Democratic 
side and proposed a bill with their 
ideas, such as unemployment com-
pensation, at $600 per person. That is 
twice as much as you get in unemploy-
ment compensation without this bill in 
Tennessee. 
Finally, I would say this: Pass this 
bill and 1 day sooner a Tennessee work-
er, instead of getting $326, would get 
nearly $1,000 if he or she has been laid 
off. There is no excuse for delaying get-
ting on this bill. It is outrageous that 
it will happen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think 
we all know what is happening here. 
The leader pointed out in his opening 
remarks that everything was going 
really quite well. There were a lot of 
working groups that were meeting. 
There was great bipartisan coopera-
tion. Both sides were getting ideas in-
cluded in a plan. Then, yesterday, the 
Speaker of the House showed up with 
an agenda and, all of a sudden, it got 
taken over at the leadership level. 
Now, instead of talking about helping 
workers, we are talking about the 
Green New Deal and all kinds of other 
things, including the demands unions 
and other special interest groups want 
to see in this deal. 
Yet the throwaway line in this is 
about bailouts for big corporations. 
Really? Are we going to do that again? 
Are we going to do this again? You 
guys are going to come over here and 
block votes and use the line that this is 
a bailout for big corporations? 
You heard what Senator ALEXANDER 
just said. This has money in here for 
workers. This has money for families. 
This has money for small businesses. It 
has lots of money, and $300 billion is 
going to go to checks: $1,200 per person, 
$2,400 per couple, and $500 per child, for 
everybody. There is up to $75,000 for a 
single and $150,000 for a married couple 
who is filing jointly. There is $250 bil-
lion in here for unemployment insur-
ance, as the Senator from Tennessee 
pointed out, in order to plus up and top 
off those unemployment funds that the 
States have, and we will add $600 per 
person, per week for the next 3 months. 
That is going to help unemployed peo-
ple in this country. 
The Small Business Loan Program, 
which was just alluded to and which 
Senators RUBIO, COLLINS, CARDIN, and 
SHAHEEN have worked on, is a $350 bil-
lion program that allows small busi-
nesses to pay their employees, to keep 
them employed so they keep their jobs 
and so those jobs don’t go away. Right 
there, that is $900 billion that will go 
to workers. 
As Senator ALEXANDER pointed out, 
there is over $242 billion in this bill 
that 
is 
going 
to 
help 
out 
with 
healthcare, and we all know we have to 
help our hospitals.

spending in this particular provision

and the $25 billion or more that is 
going to be part of the Medicare provi-
sions, that will be $100 billion for hos-
pitals; 
$20 
billion 
for 
veterans’ 
healthcare; $11 billion for vaccines, 
therapeutics, diagnostics, and other 
preparedness needs; $4.5 billion for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention; $1.7 billion for the Strategic 
National Stockpile; $12 billion for the 
military; $10 billion for block grants to 
States; $12 billion for K–12 education; 
$6 billion for higher education; $5 bil-
lion for the FEMA Disaster Relief 
Fund; $10 billion for the airports; and 
$20 billion for public transportation 
emergency relief. 
All told, there is $242 billion—$186 
billion, I might add, which will go to 
the States. Everybody talks about 
helping out the States. There is $186 
billion of the $242 billion in this part of 
the bill that will go to the States. 
So there is $900 billion and another 
$250 billion. You are looking at $1.2 
trillion to $1.3 trillion, roughly, of this 
bill that will be going to healthcare 
workers, hospitals, medical providers, 
families, employees, and unemployed 
people. That is where it will go. 
Yes, there is $500 billion in here to 
keep industries afloat that are failing, 
and they are failing by the day and 
shedding jobs by the day. These aren’t 
grants—although, the Democrats did 
want some grants in here, I might add. 
These are loans. These have to be paid 
back. Bailouts usually apply to those 
who did something dumb on their own, 
who 
made 
bad 
business 
decisions. 
These companies aren’t in trouble be-
cause of something they did on their 
own. This is no fault of their own. They 
are in trouble because they have been 
shut down, and they all hire millions of 
employees in this country. So, yes, we 
probably need to do something to help 
businesses in this country so they can 
keep working and keep their employees 
working. 
This was put together with a lot of 
bipartisan input. The leader appointed 
task forces, and the Democratic leader 
assigned people to task forces. I ob-
served those meetings and the discus-
sions that went on. They were bipar-
tisan. I participated in some of those. 
They were bipartisan, and we came to-
gether. All of these things that have 
been put together in this plan were de-
veloped with an idea toward getting 
help to workers, employees, small busi-
nesses, healthcare professionals—the 
people who are fighting the crisis on 
the 
frontline. 
Yet 
here 
we 
are, 
dillydallying around, and we can’t even 
get on the bill. 
As the leader pointed out, there is 
another 60-vote threshold that comes 
later. If you want to block it then, you 
can block it then. We can’t even get on 
the bill. The country is burning. The 
country is burning, and your side 
wants to play political games. 
It is time to get this done. The Amer-
ican people expect us to act. They need 
action. We need to work together to 
get this done for the American people. 
Do not come out here and say over and 
over and over again that this is a bail-
out for big corporations. This bill is 
about workers. It is about people. It is 
about families. It is about people who 
are hurting out there economically, 
and we need to do something about it. 
We are in a position to do something 
about it, and it is high time that we 
did. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to suggest to my friends on both 
sides of the aisle that we first assume 
the appropriate distance and then, sec-
ondly, that we take a deep breath. The 
emotions we have seen on the floor on 
both sides of the aisle are reflected in 
homes across America, where families 
are very emotional at this moment as 
we face this public health crisis. It is 
no surprise that it is reflected on the 
floor of the Senate. We are going to 
solve this problem, and we are going to 
do it in a timely way, which the Amer-
ican people expect of us. 
We have had two measures now that 
have come before us—one for $8 billion 
and another for $100 billion—that were 
addressed on a bipartisan basis with an 
agreement. This will be as well. 
Now, as for this argument that we 
can’t spare 1 minute, that we can’t 
spare 1 day, I understand the sense of 
urgency. 
The House of Representatives passed 
the second bill, the $100 billion bill, in 
the early morning hours of Saturday. 
When did the Senate pass the bill? It 
passed it on Wednesday—more than 4 
days later. 
With regard to this $100 billion bill, 
which included medical leave, acceler-
ated access to unemployment com-
pensation, food, new Medicaid pay-
ments to States, a guarantee that you 
would never have to pay for a test, the 
Republican leader waited 4 days to call 
that bill. His argument was, Wait a 
minute; the paperwork is not here. 
Well, I checked on that because the 
Senator from Idaho raised it on the 
floor, and it turns out that, as we have 
many, many times—and we were pre-
pared here—by consent, you can move 
on a measure before the paper actually 
comes across from the other body. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Illinois yield for an in-
quiry? 
Mr. DURBIN. I will yield. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, isn’t it a 
fact, when the Senator was up here 
talking and demanding that we pass 
that bill, that the bill wasn’t here? I 
have spent 40 years in the Senate, and 
I have never been able to convince a 
Parliamentarian that we should vote 
on a House bill that wasn’t here. It 
wasn’t here. The Republicans aren’t in 
charge of the House; it is the Demo-
crats. NANCY PELOSI is in charge of the 
House. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader has the 
floor. 
The assistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I might 
say to my friend from Idaho that it is 
not unusual for us to move on a meas-
ure before the bill, the paper, has come 
across the rotunda. We do it by con-
sent. Yes, it happens here, and we were 
prepared to do it again. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader has the 
floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if time 
remains on the Republicans’ side, they 
can use it as they wish. 
Mr. COTTON. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will 
not yield at this moment. I want to fin-
ish my comment as I allowed the Sen-
ator from South Dakota to finish his. I 
hope the Senator from Arkansas will 
show me that respect. Thank you. 
Measures that have been raised this 
morning are important measures, and 
for the most part, my colleagues are 
pushing an open door. 
The Rubio-Cardin plan is one that I 
support. It is supported on a bipartisan 
basis. I think it is an excellent idea for 
dealing with the challenges of res-
taurants and small businesses. I sup-
port it. There is no issue in terms of 
whether that will be included in the 
final package. I believe it will, and I 
certainly hope it will. 
As for the notion of cash payments 
that was brought to us by the White 
House, I don’t hear any objection what-
soever on the Democratic side of the 
aisle to it. 
With regard to the notion of extend-
ing unemployment insurance and pro-
viding additional benefits within un-
employment insurance, I guess we are 
going to argue as to who came up with 
the idea first, but both sides agree on 
that basic idea. 
So these proposals that have been 
brought before us are not in con-
troversy, as I understand it, in the ne-
gotiations that are underway. The 
thing that I was concerned about and 
that Senator SCHUMER addressed—and 
Senator 
MANCHIN
raised 
the 
same 
issue—was 
really 
focusing 
on 
the 
threshold issue of the capacity of our 
healthcare system to deal with this 
public health crisis. 
When we heard the Governor of New 
York this morning suggest that the 
hospitals of that State will have to in-
crease their capacity by 50 percent and 
that it will still not be enough, it is a 
suggestion to all of us that we need to 
start with healthcare and hospitals. It 
was our feeling that the bill Senator 
MCCONNELL tried to move yesterday 
was not adequate. It didn’t provide the 
necessary resources for that. When we 
return to this measure—it has been 
said by Senator SCHUMER and others 
that it could be today, and I pray that 
it will be—I think you will find addi-
tional 
resources 
for 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare. In my State, that is a crit-
ical element. 
Let me also talk about the fact that 
we are dealing with a bill of great im-
portance and great magnitude. Reflect

S1925 
March 23, 2020 
for a moment that the amount of 
money we are talking about in this bill 
is roughly equivalent to the entire Fed-
eral Government’s domestic discre-
tionary budget in 1 year. We are deal-
ing with this bill, as we should, on an 
urgent basis. We should take care to 
make sure we do the best we can but to 
not wait for the perfect. Let’s make 
sure we have something that is good 
and responsive to the needs we have. 
I also think that the measure yester-
day 
that 
was 
pushed 
by 
Senator 
MCCONNELL did not provide adequate 
resources to State and local govern-
ments. When I talk to my Governor in 
Illinois, Governor Pritzker, they are 
spending money in ways they never 
dreamed of in order to deal with this 
public health crisis. They are also see-
ing 
more 
unemployment 
insurance 
benefits being claimed than we ever 
have in our history. We need to help 
the State and local governments, and 
that was one of the objections we had 
to the bill yesterday. We didn’t feel 
that it was adequate. 
When it comes to corporations and 
providing help to businesses, large and 
small, count me in. I am one of those 
Democrats who stood for the stimulus 
package that President Obama brought 
before us because I thought it was nec-
essary. I still believe we did the right 
thing in passing that stimulus package 
when many on the other side of the 
aisle did not. Part of that package 
helped larger corporations, and so be 
it, for I thought that was necessary. 
Yet we learned a bitter lesson. Many 
times, the benefits being given to those 
corporations and the tax breaks being 
given to them translated into stock 
buybacks, 
whereby 
they 
took 
the 
money and ran. We don’t want that to 
happen again. 
Arguing for transparency and ac-
countability on the money that goes to 
any business, large or small, is not un-
reasonable, and it used to be bipar-
tisan. We are arguing over that, debat-
ing over that, and negotiating over 
that at this minute. 
Let me also say that I continue to be 
amazed at the references to the Speak-
er of the House, NANCY PELOSI. She 
really unnerves a lot of people on that 
side of the aisle. She is the Speaker of 
the House, you know, and the meas-
ure—whatever we do here—will be 
headed over there for consideration. 
The fact that she would want to be 
party to that negotiation is not an out-
rageous idea. It happens to be con-
sistent with the bicameral system of 
government that we have. 
The Senator from Kentucky got up 
and talked about how she came into 
the meeting and ruined the whole 
meeting by asserting herself as the 
Speaker of the House. It is reasonable 
for her to do that. In fact, the sugges-
tion by Senator SCHUMER at the outset 
was that we have the four corners—the 
four leaders, the Democrats and Repub-
licans—and a representative of the 
White House for this negotiation. That 
approach was rejected by the Senator 
from Kentucky. We will do our own, he 
says. We will get back to you when we 
have a Republican plan. It was not bi-
partisan from the start, and it should 
be all the way. It is the only way it 
will work. 
Let me say for a moment that if and 
when we have reached an agreement— 
and I pray that it will be done under 
the circumstances—and if and when we 
vote for cloture on the motion to pro-
ceed, at that point, the Senator from 
Kentucky can offer any amendment he 
wishes. At that point, I hope that we 
will have an agreement and that we 
will all agree to do it in a quick fash-
ion. Yet this idea that it is going to be 
instantaneous as soon as we vote for 
the motion on cloture on the motion to 
proceed is not a fact, and it hasn’t been 
for a long time. 
Let me just conclude by making an 
observation on something related to 
our meeting here today and what is 
going on in the United States of Amer-
ica. Five of our Members did not vote 
yesterday on the Republican side of the 
aisle. One has been diagnosed as having 
COVID–19, and the other four are self- 
quarantining because of the concern 
about their own health, which is nat-
ural. It is naive for us to believe this 
will be the end of this challenge to our 
membership. 
I implore Senators to consider the bi-
partisan 
measure 
that 
Senator 
PORTMAN and I have offered for remote 
voting. We should not be physically 
present on this floor at this moment. 
We know better, and our staff is sub-
jected to whatever we bring on the 
floor in terms of viral load. Let’s think 
about this in human terms. Too many 
of our colleagues and their families are 
falling prey to this disease. We should 
change the rules of the Senate to re-
flect humanity and reality. It is the 
21st century. Voting in a remote fash-
ion, as I have suggested with Senator 
PORTMAN, is the best way, I think, to 
protect us and our families from fur-
ther problems from a health viewpoint. 
Let me close by saying a final word 
on this. Senator SCHUMER came to the 
floor and didn’t say, with arms crossed, 
we are stonewalling. He said he had to 
leave the floor to go back and nego-
tiate. With whom? He left the floor to 
negotiate with the Republican leaders 
from the White House and, perhaps, 
from other places. That is the way it 
should be. 
We are going to get this done today. 
Take a deep breath. Everybody is emo-
tional at this moment on both sides of 
the aisle, but we have a job to do, and 
we are going to get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
TILLIS). For the information of the 
Members, the majority has approxi-
mately 14 minutes, and the minority 
has 15 minutes. 
Which Member seeks recognition? 
The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I have 
been here for 5 years. I came from an-
other world, one in which, to get any-
thing done, you had to compromise. 
The problem we have today is that I 
can’t find any partners with whom to 
compromise. 
This bill has been characterized as 
another bailout for large corporations. 
Really? That is the most amazing char-
acterization I could hear today. 
When I look at this, what this bill is 
focused on is the American worker, 
who, in the time we have been debating 
this morning here, thousands have had 
phone calls given to them today by 
their employer to say: We are sorry, 
but because of the liquidity situation 
we have, there is no demand for our 
products or services. We need you to go 
home. 
That has been going on now for 
weeks, while we sit up here and talk 
and blame each other for things. 
The time for action is right now. 
This bill gives us an opportunity to 
bring over almost $2 trillion of liquid-
ity to the American people who are in 
need. This is not about Big Business. 
As a matter of fact, I don’t see any 
grants in here. What I see are liquidity 
opportunities so employers can keep 
their relationship with the employees. 
We have already heard the details 
today: direct payments of $300 billion 
directly to individuals, $250 billion for 3 
months of unemployment insurance— 
unprecedented—$350 billion going di-
rectly to small businesses. Why? So 
that they can keep their employees 
employed, even if they are furloughed. 
There are $500 billion being made 
available for loans through our bank-
ing community. This is federally guar-
anteed loans. These are not grants. 
These are not moneys that are going to 
go to the boards and the executives and 
all that. This is money that is going 
for the purpose of getting directly to 
payroll. 
There are $517 billion of tax deferrals 
on withholding taxes on the corporate 
side. That is a 1-year deferral. That is 
not a guarantee; it is not a grant. 
There are $250 billion of other mon-
eys, 180 of which is going to cities and 
municipalities and States. 
And I agree with the assistant leader 
of the Democratic Party that we might 
need to do more for our States, and 
let’s get to it, if that is the biggest 
issue here, but that is not the biggest 
issue. There are so many of these other 
things that are being thrown in this 
bill because it is a big bill; it is unprec-
edented. 
But let me just say this: What we 
have done is try to make this a situa-
tion where we can avoid a liquidity cri-
sis causing an insolvency crisis, and 
that is the most damaging thing we 
can do to the American worker. 
At the end of the day, the American 
worker has something that they all 
have in common. They have an em-
ployer. That employer is made up of in-
vestors, just like you and I, who invest 
in those companies who employ these 
people. 
This is not a government employing 
150 million people in our workforce.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1926 
March 23, 2020 
This is about getting the American 
economy a bridge—and that is all this 
is, is a bridge to weather this medical 
crisis that we have. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the comments from the Senator 
from Georgia. There are plenty of nego-
tiations going on. I don’t know what he 
means when he says he doesn’t have 
anybody to negotiate with. I just spent 
2 hours with Secretary Mnuchin talk-
ing about provisions of this bill. 
We spent hours on Friday and Satur-
day talking within our committees. I 
applaud Senator RUBIO, what he and 
Senator CARDIN did. There has been bi-
partisanship but not from the majority 
leader, and that has really fundamen-
tally been the problem—the Republican 
leader. 
Let’s back up. Let’s back up 10 days. 
I stood on this floor—Senator DURBIN 
was here, a bunch of us—when Senator 
MCCONNELL on a Thursday night, we 
were this close to agreement with the 
House on the second package, the one 
that had sick leave policy. We were 
that close. 
Senator MCCONNELL decided he had 
to go back to Kentucky to go to a po-
litical event with a Justice of the Su-
preme Court—a political event with a 
Justice of the Supreme Court. 
Mr. COTTON. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. BROWN. Of course. 
Mr. COTTON. When did the Senate 
receive that bill from the House? 
Mr. BROWN. That is not the point. 
The point is that— 
Mr. COTTON. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. BROWN. Certainly. 
Mr. COTTON. Will you answer my 
question? When did we receive that 
bill? 
Mr. BROWN. I don’t know the day, 
but I know it was a day or two later. 
Mr. COTTON. Where has the House 
been for the last week? 
Mr. BROWN. I am not yielding now, 
Senator COTTON. I know you always 
want to do Trump’s—the President’s 
bidding. I have the floor, and I will 
keep the floor. 
The fact is, we were in negotiations 
with Speaker PELOSI, I assume with 
Leader MCCARTHY. In the Senate, we 
were this close to legislation. 
Senator MCCONNELL went home. Sen-
ator COTTON is not disputing the fact 
he went home for a political event with 
a Justice of the Supreme Court, for 
gosh sakes—went home. 
We didn’t vote Friday. We didn’t vote 
Saturday. We didn’t vote Sunday. We 
didn’t vote Monday. We didn’t vote 
Tuesday. We didn’t vote until Wednes-
day. So we have tried to be bipartisan. 
Senator MCCONNELL then dispatched 
all of us just a few days ago to do nego-
tiations within our committees. I sat 
with— 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. BROWN. Well, I would like to 
sort of explain the details, but if the 
time comes out of your time, I would 
be glad to. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. My question will 
be short. 
Is it not true that the bill to which 
the Senator refers was still being writ-
ten over the weekend, and it would 
have been impossible for the U.S. Sen-
ate to vote on it before Monday? 
Mr. BROWN. No. The answer to that 
question is no. It would have been pos-
sible. We can always suspend the rules 
and move if it is in the national inter-
est. 
But we didn’t vote—you know this, 
Senator ALEXANDER—we didn’t vote 
until Wednesday. 
But let me back up. This weekend 
Senator CRAPO and I and Banking Com-
mittee Members were making progress 
on Friday and Saturday. Then Satur-
day night, Senator MCCONNELL decided 
that he would take everything back 
and write a partisan bill. So don’t tell 
us that this has been a bipartisan ef-
fort. 
Again, Senator RUBIO and Senator 
CARDIN had some bipartisan efforts. We 
attempted that, but the fact is, we 
need to learn from 10 years ago. The 
same people came to us and said: We 
need this bailout. They promised that 
it would help people stay in their 
homes. They promised it would be 
money in the pockets of workers. 
The banks have done well, the execu-
tives have done well, but since then, 
wages have basically remained flat. 
The American people don’t want an-
other corporate bailout. They don’t 
want a bailout for Wall Street. They 
don’t want a bailout for the airlines. 
They want money—if we are going to 
do a relief package, the money needs to 
go in the pockets of workers. 
We know that hundreds of people, 
thousands of people in each of our 
States are faced every day with this 
situation: Do I go to work? I am sick 
today. Do I go to work and possibly in-
fect somebody else in the workplace or 
do I stay home and lose the pay I need 
in order to pay my mortgage or in 
order to pay my rent? 
This plan is all about a corporate 
bailout. The money—$425 billion that 
the Secretary of Treasury can decide is 
a slush fund or where to direct that 
money instead of money going to work-
ers, to food banks, to unemployment 
insurance, to sick days policy, to all of 
the things that we need to do to keep 
businesses going and people in their 
homes. 
We have a prohibition that so far 
Senator MCCONNELL has objected to on 
foreclosures and evictions. You all 
know the statistics—40 percent of 
Americans 
don’t 
have 
$400 
discre-
tionary money in their pockets that 
they can use in an emergency to fix 
their car or whatever. 
If they go several weeks without pay, 
they will be evicted; they will be fore-
closed on. We need Senator MCCONNELL 
to actually agree to that. 
And when it comes to the $425 billion 
slush fund, we want to help these busi-
nesses, especially small businesses. We 
want to help the airlines, but we need 
to make sure that this money passes 
through to employees. That means no 
corporate bailouts without investing in 
the dignity of work; it means if you are 
taking 
taxpayer 
money, 
no 
stock 
buybacks, no sending jobs overseas, no 
outsourcing your jobs to independent 
contractors, no golden parachutes for 
executives, no using taxpayer dollars 
to bust unions, no wage cuts for these 
employees, no healthcare or pension 
cuts. 
If we put money into these busi-
nesses, this money is there not for the 
executives; it is there for the workers, 
and it is there for the community. It 
means actually helping people stay in 
their homes. 
If you love this country, you fight for 
the people who make it work. We have 
to show the people we serve that we 
have learned from Congress’s mistake 
10 years ago when the banks did very 
well, thank you. And Wall Street again 
will do very well, thank you, under the 
McConnell plan. 
We have to come together to put 
money in people’s pockets. We need to 
help people stay in their homes. We 
need to invest in healthcare workers 
who are on the frontlines. We need to 
mobilize American manufacturers. 
The partisan McConnell plan doesn’t 
do this. The bipartisan work we are 
trying to do could do this. We know we 
can get through this together, put this 
partisanship aside, and come together 
for the people whom we serve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would 
defer to the Senator from Tennessee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from North Dakota. 
I have a parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator will state the inquiry. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the 
discussion we just heard was about 
when the Senate could have voted on 
H.R. 6201, which was the bill that came 
over from the House. 
When did that bill from the House of 
Representatives arrive in the U.S. Sen-
ate? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It came 
to the Senate on Tuesday, the 17th. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. On Tuesday, the 
17th. 
And my second question is, Could the 
U.S. Senate have voted on that bill be-
fore it arrived from the House of Rep-
resentatives? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would 
take consent. The Senate has done it 
on several occasions. In one case, H.R. 
3630, the Middle Class Tax Relief & Job 
Creation Act; another case, H.R. 2194, 
Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Ac-
countability, and Investment Act. It 
would take consent. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Did anyone ask 
consent that it be voted on before 
Wednesday?

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair does not have any record of a re-
quest for consent. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I be-
lieve I have the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want 
to talk about the bill that we want to 
vote on right now and why it is so im-
portant that we pass it. 
For my part, what I work on is sup-
port for our farmers and our ranchers, 
and that is exactly what we have put in 
this bill is help and support for our 
farmers and ranchers, for rural Amer-
ica. 
And yet, my understanding is that 
Democrats are objecting to the help 
and support that we have put in this 
bill for our farmers and ranchers. 
Last week, the Department of Home-
land Security recognized that agri-
culture—our supply of food, fiber, and 
feed—is one of our Nation’s critical in-
dustries. Our country has been blessed 
with an abundant, affordable, and safe 
food supply that we rarely stop to no-
tice but that we depend on every single 
day and we certainly depend on at this 
time with this pandemic. 
The good news is, our farmers and 
ranchers, our ag sector, are out there 
working every day, carrying on this 
critical work of ensuring that we have 
the 
food 
on 
our 
grocery 
shelves 
throughout this pandemic. 
The bad news is, the farm economy, 
already facing a number of years of de-
clining income, has taken a further 
nosedive on account of the coronavirus. 
So we have put forward assistance to 
make sure we address that. 
Let me just give you one example, 
though, of the difficulty faced in farm 
country, in rural America. 
The cattle industry has lost between 
$7 billion and $9 billion over the last 2 
months—over the last 2 months—and 
that is just one sector of our ag econ-
omy. 
Congress needs to act, and we need to 
act now, to ensure that farmers, ranch-
ers, 
and 
rural 
America—farmers, 
ranchers, and rural America—receive 
the relief they desperately need. 
Why would Democrats object to that? 
Why would they object to that? 
We included two important provi-
sions to ensure that rural America and 
our farm and ranch families receive as-
sistance. 
First, we replenish the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, making sure that 
the CCC has the funding necessary to 
carry out the farm bill, including the 
farm safety net, conservation pro-
grams, trade programs, as well as 
emergency and ad hoc programs like 
the Market Facilitation Program. 
Second, we increase CCC authority to 
ensure 
that 
we 
can 
meet 
the 
coronavirus 
impact 
on 
agriculture 
head-on. That makes sense. That is in 
the bill. They are objecting to it. They 
are objecting. This is our food supply. 
This is our food chain. 
We also included an important provi-
sion that enables USDA to provide crit-
ical support to ranchers during this 
market downturn—to ranchers. How-
ever, the Senate Democrats are object-
ing to that provision. Congressional 
Democratic leadership has objected to 
helping our farmers and ranchers in 
this relief package. 
The bill also includes an additional 
$15.5 billion for the SNAP program—for 
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, for food stamps—to provide 
nutrition assistance for those affected 
by this economic downturn. 
I urge my colleagues to get on board 
and support our farmers, our ranchers, 
and our food supply. Support rural 
America. Quit objecting to rural Amer-
ica. Quit objecting to our farmers and 
ranchers. We can’t let that happen. We 
have talked about the importance of 
the bill. It is important for our entire 
country, and it is certainly important 
for our farmers and for our ranchers 
and for the food supply—the lowest 
cost, highest quality food supply that 
they provide every single American 
every single day. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. 
Mr. TILLIS. The majority has 5 min-
utes. The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
Do you know what the American peo-
ple are thinking right now? They are 
thinking that the brain is an amazing 
organ. It starts working in a mother’s 
womb, and it doesn’t stop working 
until you get elected to Congress. 
Do you know what the American peo-
ple are thinking right now? They are 
thinking that this country was founded 
by geniuses, but it is being run by a 
bunch of idiots. 
Do you know what the American peo-
ple are thinking right now? They are 
thinking, Why do the Members of the 
U.S. Senate continue to double down 
on stupid? This is not a Republican 
bill, Mr. Chairman; this is a bipartisan 
bill. We have spent hours and hours 
and hours negotiating these provisions 
with our Democratic friends. 
This is not a slush fund. This a bill to 
help people and businesses in America. 
This bill is going to increase unem-
ployment insurance. This bill is going 
to send $1,200 to every man and woman 
in America—taxpayers who make less 
than $75,000 a year—and $500 for each of 
their children. 
This bill is going to help every small 
business in this country. It is not a 
bailout. It provides up to $350 billion 
for small businesses for the next 8 
weeks to keep them going, and if they 
don’t lay anybody off, the bill provides 
that the loans are forgiven. 
We have some businesses in this 
country that are bigger than 500 em-
ployees. This bill has a provision to 
help them, too, as well. In the America 
I was raised in, growing your business 
and becoming as large as possible was 
something we aspired to. 
This bill does not create a slush fund 
for the Treasury Secretary. It provides 
$75 billion to help some of our indus-
tries hardest hit in a collateralized 
loan, not a bailout, and then provides 
another $425 billion to the Federal Re-
serve under section 13(3) of the Federal 
Reserve Act, which the Federal Re-
serve will make available to all busi-
nesses, including those that don’t qual-
ify as a small business. It is not a gift. 
We can negotiate warrants; we can ne-
gotiate stock options; we can take a 
piece of their company in stock. 
I don’t understand it. I get politics; I 
have been around it my whole life. But 
there comes a time when we have to 
stop thinking about the next election 
and start thinking about the next gen-
eration. 
What are we going to leave to our 
children if we allow this economy to 
crash? And it is happening as we speak. 
I mean no ill will toward my Demo-
cratic friends. I like and respect every 
one of them. But let’s pass this bill. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion by the Senator from Connecticut 
is heard. 
There is less than 10 minutes remain-
ing. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, you 
can’t keep on saying it is a bipartisan 
bill when it clearly is not. If it were a 
bipartisan bill, you wouldn’t have this 
level of angst from the Democrats who 
were shut out of the process. 
Let’s be clear about what we are 
talking about here. We don’t think 
your bill works. We don’t think the bill 
that has been drafted by the majority 
party is going to fix the problem. This 
is a policy disagreement, and I have an 
obligation as a representative of my 
State to stand up and say when I don’t 
think a $2 trillion bill is going to fix 
the problem. It may make a lot of peo-
ple rich, but it doesn’t have the re-
sources in it today to take care of the 
most vulnerable in this country, and it 
is not going to do the primary job at 
hand, which is to stop the virus. 
Remember, there is no amount of 
economic stimulus we can pass—$1 tril-
lion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion—that will 
solve this problem if we don’t get seri-
ous about the public health crisis that 
exists today. When you shortchange 
States, when you don’t provide enough 
money to help my State and my mu-
nicipalities manage testing, move con-
gregate populations apart from each 
other, and try to manage the crisis, 
then you aren’t serious about stopping 
the virus. Yes, one of the outstanding 
issues in this bill is that we think we 
need more funding for the States and 
municipalities 
that 
are 
on 
the 
frontlines of fighting the virus. Yes, we 
don’t think this bill will work—will 
work—at job No. 1, which is stopping 
the public health crisis, unless we pro-
vide ample funding. And, yes, we are 
worried about the lack of condition-
ality on funding to big businesses, to

Wall Street. Yes, we are worried about 
the fact that this is going to make rich 
people much richer and, at the same 
time, not actually stop the public 
health crisis. 
These are policy differences. Instead 
of coming down here and having show-
boat after showboat, we should be sit-
ting together trying to resolve dif-
ferences that, frankly, I don’t think 
are so large that they can’t be solved 
within the next several hours. 
I just hope we understand that we are 
down here very frustrated because we 
worry that we are about to vote on a 
bill that is not going to solve the prob-
lem. That is a policy disagreement but 
a policy disagreement that can be re-
solved. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how 
much time is remaining on our side? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
51⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator 
from Montana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, during 
the past couple of weeks, I have been 
talking to Montanans about their 
needs as we deal with this coronavirus. 
Healthcare officials tell me that folks 
on the frontlines need more masks, 
more protective equipment, and, quite 
frankly, this bill does not get that 
done. It helps, but it doesn’t get it 
done. Small businesses and their em-
ployees are telling me that they need 
immediate access to relief. This bill 
doesn’t do that because, quite frankly, 
we need more on the front end on 
bridge loans. Tax credits are great, but 
you have to be in business to be able to 
take advantage of those. Mayors and 
local city officials are worried that if 
they can’t keep up with the mounting 
needs their communities are facing, 
this bill fails them. Tribal leaders 
across Montana have made it clear to 
me and to other folks in this body that 
they are largely and unfortunately ig-
nored in the bill before us. 
This bill is nearly $2 trillion. One of 
the things it does do, and I know there 
are folks on the floor right now who 
disagree, but the fact is, massive cor-
porations through that $500 billion 
slush fund, which, I might add, has 
very little, if any, transparency or ac-
countability—it goes to those folks. 
Look, I think all of us agree that $2 
trillion is a lot of money. It is all bor-
rowed money, and if there is ever a 
time to borrow money, it is in eco-
nomic times like these, but this needs 
to be a targeted, temporary support to 
keep our economy going. 
As the Senator from Connecticut 
said, the fact is that this bill, particu-
larly this slush fund, is not a good use 
of taxpayer money. It would allow an 
unelected official with no account-
ability to the American people to dole 
out $500 billion while hiding the re-
ceipts for months, if not longer. 
I know there are Senators who say: 
Well, they can get warrants for these 
loans. They must get warrants for 
these loans. 
These companies can take advantage 
of hundreds of billions of dollars of this 
money and continue to lay off some of 
those same taxpayers who are sup-
porting them through their taxes. 
Montanans know we can do better, 
and they expect better. Working to-
gether, I am going to tell you, we can 
get this done. There isn’t a person in 
this body who hasn’t filled a leadership 
position outside of their service to the 
U.S. Senate. You know that you need 
to negotiate and you need to com-
promise. If that is done and it is done 
in good faith, we will have a bill before 
the day is done. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I can 
give you a very long list to describe ev-
erything we are doing here to help 
small business people in this country, 
our 
hospitals, 
personal 
protective 
equipment. 
Let me say this. This bill was written 
by both Democrats and Republicans in 
good faith. It is time to get over our 
differences and put our country before 
ourselves. Let’s come together and 
vote this bill out of the Senate now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how 
much time remains on our side? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
2 minutes 40 seconds. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me 
just say, strike a responsible distance 
and take a deep breath. We are going to 
pass this bill—not the one that Senator 
MCCONNELL brought before us yester-
day but a version of that, which I think 
is a dramatic improvement. 
My prayer is that bill is going to in-
clude even more money than the 
McConnell bill when it comes to deal-
ing with the healthcare crisis we face 
and 
the 
challenge 
we 
face—more 
money for hospitals, more money for 
providers, and more money for equip-
ment, and we are going to have to 
come back again, I am sorry to say, if 
this continues, to make sure we put 
even greater investment in the men 
and women who will save our lives 
across this country. 
Secondly, we want to make certain 
that this McConnell bill is improved 
when it comes to accountability for the 
taxpayer dollars given to the largest 
corporations in America. Some of us 
feel burned by what has happened with 
some of those corporations in the past 
when we trusted their leadership to 
build their companies and help their 
employees, but, instead, they built up 
their own bank accounts at the expense 
of their employees. We don’t want to 
return to those days. I am sure the Re-
publicans don’t either. We want lan-
guage in this bill that moves this in 
the direction of accountability and 
transparency when it comes to spend-
ing taxpayers’ dollars by major cor-
porations. 
Third, never overlook the need of 
State and local governments. They 
have been waiting, begging, and plead-
ing with the administration in the 
White House to give national leader-
ship. Absent that, they have taken on 
the responsibility themselves. They are 
asking us to stand behind them as they 
make these difficult decisions, State 
by State by State, because the White 
House refuses to make these same deci-
sions. We need to provide the resources 
to do that. State and local govern-
ments need that help, and I believe the 
McConnell bill could be improved by 
providing more resources in that re-
gard. 
There are so many bipartisan things 
that we do agree upon in this bill. Let’s 
get these things right. As Senator 
MURPHY
of Connecticut said, if we 
don’t get it right in terms of dealing 
with the coronavirus, we can’t put 
enough money on the table for eco-
nomic recovery. Let’s do it. 
I am sorry we are going to this roll 
call. It is not an indication of the 
progress that I believe has been made 
since yesterday in negotiating a bipar-
tisan 
approach 
to 
improving 
the 
McConnell bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
Mr. DURBIN. I think it is time to 
recognize that. 
Thank you.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019—Motion 
to Proceed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 748, which the clerk 
will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 157, 
H.R. 748, a bill to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of our colleagues on 
both sides, as a result of this proce-
dural obstruction, let me explain where 
we are. 
By refusal to allow us to take this 
first step, which would have still given 
them plenty of time to negotiate, we 
have put the Senate in the following 
position: If any 1 of the 100 of us choos-
es to object, we can’t deal with this 
until Friday or Saturday at the ear-
liest. If any 1 of the 100 of us objects to 
some of the procedural hurdles we have 
to overcome as a result of this mind-
less obstruction—absolutely mindless 
obstruction going on on the other side, 
while the public is waiting for us to 
act, while people are losing their jobs, 
losing their income, and shutting down 
the economy, which we have had to do 
to deal with this public health crisis, 
they are fiddling around with Senate 
procedure that could, if 1 Senator ob-
jected, take us all the way to the end 
of the week to solve this problem. 
I am beginning to think our Demo-
cratic colleagues don’t understand the 
procedure in the Senate. I am not sure 
you understand the position your lead-
er has put you in. He loses nothing— 
nothing—in terms of negotiating lever-
age by letting us get through these 
procedural hoops sooner rather than 
later—sooner rather than later. 
The 
American 
people 
have 
had 
enough of this nonsense. They wonder 
where we are. They are looking to us to 
solve this problem. 
The Secretary of the Treasury keeps 
going into the Democratic leader’s of-
fice, and the list keeps getting longer 
and longer and longer. The bazaar is 
apparently open on the other side. 
Never let a crisis go to waste, one 
former President’s Chief of Staff fa-
mously said. 
So, look, I hope my colleagues will 
come out here and express themselves 
in the course of the afternoon. The 
American people would like to hear 
from us. They would like to know what 
is going on here. So let’s tell them. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SASSE. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are at an odd spot right now not just as 
a Senate but as a nation. We have mil-
lions of people who are gathered in 
their own homes, trying to figure out 
what is going to happen next, waiting 
for a virus to die down. We have people 
in a hospital who are afraid because 
there is no tested treatment yet. We 
have firefighters; we have law enforce-
ment; we have hospital workers all 
with not enough personal protection 
equipment because they do not know 
who is a citizen without the virus and 
who is a citizen with the virus. 
The most basic elements of decision 
making of how you take care of your 
neighbor have become a distraction 
across the country as Americans have 
become afraid of a stranger and of a 
friend. This is a huge shift in where we 
are as a country. What this demands is 
immediate action. Three weeks ago, 
the Senate and the House passed $8.3 
billion, and we did it with an over-
whelming bipartisan support, to add 
additional funding for diagnostics, for 
testing, and for rapid work on a vac-
cine. All of that work is advancing 
quickly. We have human trials on a 
vaccine happening right now because 
we came together, and there weren’t 
extra things added to it. We focused in 
on the problem, which is the virus. 
This body has a lot of things we dis-
agree on, there is no question. There 
are lots of moments to debate the 
things we disagree on, but this is a 
time we need to focus in on what is the 
problem, and the problem is dealing 
with COVID–19. There was a bipartisan 
bill that was put together in the Sen-
ate. 
A week ago today, Senator SCHUMER 
released a 10-page list of—here are the 
things the Democrats would like from 
the Senate. It was a 10-page, very de-
tailed list. Twenty-eight of those items 
on that list are included in this bipar-
tisan bill—28 items from it, of that 10- 
page list of items. So much of that list 
that was released a week ago is in-
cluded in this bipartisan bill. 
Republican chairmen and Democratic 
ranking members of the committees of 
jurisdiction met and talked about this. 
The chairman and the ranking member 
of Appropriations worked together on 
an appropriations package for a quar-
ter of a trillion dollars on just that one 
section that they worked on together 
to get resolution. Put all of those 
items together, and let me tell you 
what I mean by that: $250 billion deal-
ing with things as distant to believe as 
things like getting Peace Corps volun-
teers back home, away from where 
they are now. We have to get them 
back home and away from harm’s way. 
There is funding in there for that as 
well as $88 billion for hospitals, trying 
to help them through this; help for 
nursing homes; help for individual fire-
fighters and their departments; $10 bil-
lion for community development block 
grants to help cities as they are rapidly 
trying to work through this process— 
$250 billion allocated just to things like 
that to help people get testing, per-
sonal equipment, travel and additional 
expenses, teleworking capabilities that 
have to be done for cities and commu-
nities and Federal entities. All of those 
things were put together and agreed 
upon. 
There is a lot of work on the medical 
side, rightfully so. Testing makes a 
world of difference on this. Getting ac-
cess to a vaccine—there are billions of 
dollars in that particular area. All of 
that is included in this proposal. 
In addition to that, there are direct 
payments that we had agreed upon to 
send out, literally, to every American. 
We had set up $1,200 for every Amer-
ican to receive. That is a stopgap 
method to help folks who are having 
trouble with their utilities or whatever 
it may be, or extra expenses so they 
will have something. 
It was not just that for the individ-
uals. It was also unemployment insur-
ance. This is something the Repub-
licans and Democrats had worked on 
together, to do a plus-up of unemploy-
ment insurance because we have mil-
lions of people suddenly unemployed 
with no advanced warning at all. 
There is a significant increase of un-
employment insurance that is built

into this, about $250 billion additional 
that is put into that amount. Small 
businesses—the goal is not to have peo-
ple on unemployment; the goal is to 
have people employed. A very creative 
thing was built into this that I happen 
to be a part of in the design, and that 
was small businesses—a business with 
500 or fewer employees—could actually 
apply for a rapid loan. That loan would 
be given to them quickly. If they used 
it for payroll, it would be forgiven en-
tirely. If they used it for their lease, it 
would be forgiven entirely. The goal 
was to not have small business go out 
of business and to keep employees cur-
rently connected to their company, not 
to put them out on unemployment but 
to keep them employed so they have 
the same system. So when we get 
through this virus, which we hope we 
do soon—they still have the same job, 
they are not on unemployment and 
later looking for a job. They are able to 
keep their same job. We thought that 
was very significant. It is a brandnew 
strategy for how to do this. It is a 
much better idea than just pushing 
people 
on 
unemployment—although, 
we do have great aid for unemploy-
ment. That program is $350 billion. 
As 
I 
have 
already 
laid 
out: 
healthcare, hospital, first responders— 
that is the first piece of this—working 
on testing, vaccines. The second piece 
is direct payments to individuals, di-
rect payments for unemployment in-
surance, and then assistance for small 
businesses to stay in business and help 
their employees stay connected to 
their business, and then, on top of that, 
loans for the largest businesses in 
America. It is not a bailout—loans for 
the largest businesses in America. 
My Democratic colleagues keep say-
ing over and over again that this is a 
bailout for the biggest companies. It is 
loans for the largest companies be-
cause—you know what—they employ a 
lot of people, and we would like those 
businesses to also stay in business. 
All of that seemed to be going well 
and negotiating well until the last 36 
hours when it suddenly blows up. Here 
is what I heard first: It is not enough. 
It is $2 trillion. It is $2 trillion. It is 
suddenly: Well, it is not enough. We 
need to plus this up to be even bigger. 
And then suddenly it has become this 
whole transition into the most random 
of things: Well, if a corporation gets a 
loan from the Federal Government, 
then someone here in Washington, DC, 
should determine how that corporation 
is run. We should have a member on 
their board or a union representative 
on their board. We should have some 
kind of stake in their board to do that. 
This was my favorite one. We should be 
able to tell the board, if they are con-
sidering layoffs, someone here in DC 
should be able to go to the company, 
evaluate the rest of their portfolio and 
tell them other ways they can do their 
business besides laying people off. Are 
you kidding me? We are now going to 
create a whole new Federal bureauc-
racy that goes to every company, and 
if they take out a loan in this program, 
they are able to tell them how to man-
age the day-to-day operations of their 
company. 
There was a requirement that every 
company had to do a $15 minimum 
wage for their company. There was a 
requirement they couldn’t do stock 
buybacks. By the way, I have no prob-
lem with prohibiting the use of these 
loan dollars to use for stock buybacks, 
but that is not the concept. The con-
cept was for the next 10 years, you 
can’t ever do stock buybacks on any-
thing, regardless if it is with these loan 
funds. 
It became this bizarre shift into—oh, 
we have an opportunity to run every 
company in America and tell them how 
to operate, and that became the goal. 
Then it became—we need to also add 
solar grants. The latest proposal that 
just came out today was $600 million 
for the National Endowment for the 
Arts and the National Endowment for 
Humanity—$600 million. It is not con-
nected to anything COVID; it was just 
that they need a plus-up of an addi-
tional $600 million for the National En-
dowment for the Arts, National Endow-
ment for the Humanities. 
The other one was that we need to 
have a forgiveness of all debt for the 
post office, ever—all post office debt. 
That was just released today. 
The list is going on and on. My frus-
tration is that I have people at home 
who are suffering, with small busi-
nesses teetering on the edge, about to 
go out of business, trying to figure out 
if there is going to be a proposal to 
come out of the Senate while folks are 
discussing whether we need to do more 
solar grants and if we are going to take 
over corporate boards and require a $15 
minimum wage at the end of this. 
Can we just deal with COVID–19? Can 
we just deal with one thing, with 
COVID–19, to say, Let’s help businesses 
and workers and families who are 
struggling? That is what I thought we 
were trying to do with this bill, but 
now suddenly it seems to be everything 
but. Let’s just do that, and then there 
is plenty of time to argue about the 
other issues. We can do those in the fu-
ture. We will have the debate on solar 
panels, I promise, but let’s deal with 
COVID–19 and the families and individ-
uals who are struggling and stop hold-
ing everything up, trying to add one 
more thing in to say: It is a really big 
bill. I am going to try to get my one 
piece. 
One thing we worked on in a bipar-
tisan way—Senator COONS and I—was 
this one area of not-for-profits. The 
not-for-profits are part of our social 
safety net. Our communities are put 
together by our families, and the peo-
ple who walk alongside our families are 
local nonprofits. When those can’t 
meet the needs, then government steps 
in to meet the needs. Our nonprofits 
are teetering on the edge right now. 
This bill allows the nonprofits to be a 
part of this whole focus on small busi-
nesses being able to get a loan and sus-
tain their personnel. It also allows in-
dividuals who want to donate to local 
nonprofits to write that off as an in-
centive for folks to be more engaged in 
that. This is a reasonable proposal on 
how to help. It is a bipartisan solution 
that Senator COONS and I have, but we 
can’t get to it and vote on it because 
we being held up by some bizarre new 
thing that is thrown in every couple of 
hours that is unrelated to COVID–19 or 
the perpetual statement of: It is only 
$2 trillion. It is not enough. 
This government is not even set up 
to distribute $2 trillion. Let’s get this 
out the door. Let’s get something 
started, and let’s keep the battle going 
for the other things. But for the sake 
of our nonprofits, for the sake of our 
small businesses, for the sake of people 
who want to stay employed, the people 
who are small business and restaurant 
owners and coffee shop owners and re-
tailers—for the sake of them, why do 
we not just go ahead and get this vote 
on and stop delaying it, trying to add 
one more special interest something 
into it? 
I move that we get going and get this 
done. I encourage my colleagues on the 
other side to stop trying to renegotiate 
everything we have already negotiated 
and to stop adding one more thing. 
Let’s make the one more thing a vote. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, earlier, 
I was on the floor and talked about 
how important it is—along with my 
fellow colleagues—that we move this 
bill and get it done now. I mean, it is 
very important that we get it done 
now. We talked about a lot of different 
things, but one of the points I wanted 
to make—I work with it so much, as do 
some of my colleagues who are going to 
join me here—is making sure we are 
also addressing rural America: our 
farmers, 
our 
ranchers, 
agriculture, 
rural America. That is the food supply 
everyone depends on every single day. 
It is so critically important all the 
time but particularly at a time like 
this when we are faced with a pandemic 
that we keep that food supply working 
and moving—the whole food chain—all 
the way from the farmer and rancher, 
all the way up to the consumer. 
As a result of what our farmers and 
ranchers do, every single American 
benefits from the lowest cost, highest 
quality food supply in the history of 
the world, and they can count on it. 
They can count on it. 
As we pass this phase 3 bill, which is 
now, I think, about $1.8 trillion, we 
cannot leave the farmers and ranchers 
of America out of the bill. It is that 
simple. Every single American depends 
on them every single day—and not just 
Americans but people around the globe. 
It is so important that we include agri-
culture in this bill. That is what we 
have worked to do. We have worked to 
make sure there is a provision in there 
so whether it is our cattle producers or 
whether it is our farmers raising crops

across this great Nation, they can con-
tinue to do what they do every day on 
behalf of all Americans. 
I talked about that a little bit ear-
lier, but some of my colleagues want to 
join in, emphasizing how critically im-
portant it is that our farmers and 
ranchers and rural America are part of 
this legislation. You see on television 
the cities every day and what is going 
on in the cities. 
In New York or San Francisco or 
wherever it may be, we get it. There 
are a lot of people there, and they are 
close together. It is a huge challenge. 
Yet the food, the sustenance—the 
food, fuel, and fiber—they get every 
day comes from the heartland. It 
comes from the rural areas. It doesn’t 
just come from the grocery store. It 
comes from rural America, and we have 
to be there for them and keep them 
going so that they can supply people 
across this Nation in communities 
large and small. 
I would like to turn to my good 
friend, the Senator from the State of 
Kansas. Clearly, it is a State known as 
part of the breadbasket of this Nation. 
I would ask that the good Senator from 
Kansas be allowed to make some com-
ments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the leadership of my colleagues 
and, 
particularly 
today, 
Senator 
HOEVEN, on his efforts. He chairs the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Agri-
culture and Rural Development. 
We are joined here by the Senator 
from Nebraska, Senator FISCHER, and 
the chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, my colleague from Kansas, to 
highlight something that is particu-
larly going to be absent from this legis-
lation. 
Earlier this month, I asked Secretary 
Perdue in a letter in which I was joined 
by many of my colleagues—both Re-
publicans and Democrats—to look for a 
way to be helpful, particularly to live-
stock producers. The men and women 
who raise cattle and who feed cattle 
are the backbone of the ag economy 
and are certainly a huge and critical 
component of how we earn a living in 
Kansas. 
Both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
signed the letter asking that Secretary 
Perdue take steps. The reason this is 
necessary, at least according to Kansas 
State University research, is that since 
the arrival of corona, since January, $8 
to $9 billion in lost income has oc-
curred for livestock producers in this 
country. That is a huge and significant 
amount of money and one that is hard 
to recover from. 
The chairman of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee, Senator HOEVEN, indi-
cated about the importance of rural 
America. This is absolutely about feed-
ing not only the rest of our country but 
the globe in its entirety. 
Before I return to this conversation 
about agriculture, I would highlight 
how difficult it is in rural America to 
recover from an economic challenge. 
Certainly, our cattlemen and our live-
stock 
producers, 
our 
farmers 
and 
ranchers, recognize that we have seen 
instance after instance in which farm-
ers are going out of business. I would 
put on top of this that, since 2013, the 
farm income in Kansas is down 50 per-
cent. 
You add this crisis to the challenge, 
and many of my farmers and ranchers 
may not—probably will not—survive 
this crisis. 
We are asking the Secretary of Agri-
culture to come to our aid. What we 
discovered is that the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, or the CCC, needed 
to be replenished. Money had been 
spent from the CCC. We proposed in 
this bill that is being debated now that 
the CCC be replenished—that $20 bil-
lion be restored to the Commodity 
Credit Corporation. 
We were told by our Democrat col-
leagues that they wanted to make cer-
tain the money couldn’t just be spent 
on the livestock side. So the provision 
in this bill, which is a bipartisan agree-
ment, shows there is certainly agree-
ment on the side of all of us that we 
care about farmers as well as ranchers. 
We changed the language to make cer-
tain the Secretary of Agriculture used 
CCC funds not only for livestock pro-
ducers but also for the cultivation side, 
or the crop side, of agriculture. 
Incidentally, my colleagues on the 
Democrat side asked that their names 
be removed from the letter. I don’t un-
derstand what happened in a manner of 
just a day or two, in which they de-
cided they were not interested in agri-
culture producers—livestock producers, 
in particular. Then, within the last 
couple of days, we now learned that the 
Democrats—I am not in the room. So I 
can’t verify this. But I am told by 
those 
who 
presumably 
know 
that 
Democrats are opposed to this provi-
sion being included in the bill at all. 
We cannot forget livestock producers 
and agriculture as we try to deal with 
the economic consequences of COVID– 
19. It is a huge challenge. I would say 
to my Democrat colleagues—those who 
signed the letter and others who vis-
ited with me and my colleagues about 
trying to solve this problem—that I 
don’t know what is going on in the 
room that I am not a part of, but we 
need to make certain that the end re-
sult is where we started, which is tak-
ing care of those who produce the food 
and fiber of our Nation. 
While I have the floor, let me point 
out the challenges of rural America 
and why it is so important to get this 
done today, now. 
Community hospitals. There are sig-
nificant resources in this bill to try to 
keep the doors of our hospitals open, to 
keep our physicians practicing medi-
cine, and to keep the pharmacy on 
Main Street. They are in this bill. 
The dentist is a pretty important 
person in a small town in Kansas—and 
the optometrist. They are all a huge 
component 
in 
how 
we 
deliver 
healthcare. These are very small busi-
nesses. Many are sole practitioners, 
and they employ just a handful of peo-
ple. 
This bill will help them. Yet it is sty-
mied. I would say that even if you are 
not a healthcare provider, this bill is 
important to every small business in 
Kansas. It is important to the business, 
not for the business’s sake but for the 
people who work for that business. We 
want that sole proprietor. We want 
that business that employs 5, 10, 50 peo-
ple. 
A lot of small manufacturers in Kan-
sas produce agriculture equipment. 
They are on the cusp of being put out 
of business, and what is so dramatic in 
rural America is, if we lose a business, 
the chances of reviving it in the future 
disappears. 
Almost all of our businesses in small 
towns across Kansas and around the 
Nation are hanging on already by a 
thread. This is the factor now that may 
put them out of business—is likely to 
put them out of business—and the 
chances of them coming back into 
business when this is over are virtually 
none. 
Our businesses are run by small fami-
lies. They are run by families, by indi-
viduals, by people who often run a busi-
ness for the sole purpose of making cer-
tain their community has a business. 
We can linger no longer and expect 
that it will get better if we don’t take 
action to help them preserve their 
business and the people who work for 
them. We need to do it now, not later. 
I yield to the Senator from North Da-
kota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank 
the Senator from Kansas for his re-
marks and his strong work on behalf 
of, not just the livestock industry and, 
of course, Kansas, which, obviously, 
has a huge role in the cattle industry, 
but for all of agriculture. You are al-
ways there, and I deeply appreciate it. 
Before I recognize our next colleague, 
I do want to make a little change in 
the order here. If I could, I would like 
to recognize our colleague from Michi-
gan who is the ranking member on the 
Ag Committee. She had some thoughts 
she wanted to interject. I would be 
willing to defer to her. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
wanted to share some thoughts, and I 
appreciate this discussion, obviously. 
As you know, Senator ROBERTS and I 
have basically coauthored the last two 
farm bills, and we all care deeply about 
rural America. I grew up in rural 
America. We have to get things done 
that are going to help small towns in 
rural America. The distinguished Sen-
ator from North Dakota and I have 
been talking about what we need to be 
doing in a number of ways. 
I just wanted to indicate that, when 
we talk about the needs that have been 
addressed through the market facilita-
tion with payments and so on, I think 
we have a joint interest in making sure

S1932 
March 23, 2020 
all of agriculture that has been hurt 
will be benefited by this. 
I understand the concerns about live-
stock. About half the cash receipts of 
the country are what we broadly call 
specialty crops. I can tell you that as 
the No. 1 producer of tart cherries in 
the 
country—maybe 
the 
world—we 
have been hit so very hard by unfair 
practices with Turkey that we could 
lose the industry. 
We have received no help so far from 
the CCC. If we are going to move for-
ward, I have supported and will con-
tinue to support doing things we need 
to do for farmers, but we have to recog-
nize all of the needs. I am certainly 
willing to work with you on that be-
cause that has to happen. 
I would finally say this. On the one 
end, we have our farmers. On the other 
end, we have all of us who eat. We have 
a lot of folks in between who think the 
food comes from the grocery store—a 
lot of kids. One of the reasons I support 
having school gardens is for children to 
understand that there actually is a lot 
of hard work involved and food comes 
from our farmers. 
Part of all of this, when we look at 
this large package, is that I know there 
is concern about not leaving farmers 
out, but we can’t leave out people who 
are at this point struggling to eat, as 
well. 
We have done a SNAP increase in 
every other crisis. In every other crisis, 
we had a temporary increase in SNAP 
funds. We desperately need to do that 
as well. We know that one of the best 
economic stimuli is to provide people 
with food assistance, who immediately 
have to spend that at the grocery 
store. Our grocery store owners, large 
and small, are challenged and are going 
to be challenged. This all goes right 
back to the farmers. 
I thank you for yielding some time. I 
want to say that there are many of us 
on both sides of the aisle who certainly 
care deeply about agriculture. We had 
the largest vote, Mr. Chairman, and 87 
of 100 Senators voted for the last farm 
bill. I think every Democrat did. We 
want to make sure we are supporting 
our farmers. 
We want to make sure that families 
are lifted up who are struggling. I am 
getting calls from churches and food 
banks and those who are desperately 
concerned about families right now. We 
can’t leave our families behind either. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank 
the Senator from Michigan. There is no 
question that she has been a strong ad-
vocate for agriculture. I appreciate 
that and her willingness to work on 
this. It is imperative that we include 
our farmers and ranchers in this pack-
age. I look forward to working with 
you. We do need to get to something we 
can approve and include in the pack-
age. 
Thank you for your comments. 
I turn to my colleague from Ne-
braska. By way of turning to her, I 
want to say that the cattle industry 
has lost between $7 and $9 billion over 
the last 2 months. I know the cattle in-
dustry is important in the Presiding 
Officer’s State. The cattle industry lost 
between $7 and $9 billion the last 2 
months. That is why this is very ur-
gent, and we need to act. 
I turn to the Senator from Nebraska 
for her comments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I wish 
to thank my colleague from North Da-
kota for really being a leader and rec-
ognizing the needs that we have across 
rural America, the needs that we are 
facing in the heartland for farmers, 
ranchers, rural communities, and rural 
hospitals. 
When we are looking at this pan-
demic and the effects it has all across 
this country, we need to be cognizant 
of the fact that we are a very diverse 
nation. We are a nation of condensed 
urban areas, and we are a nation with 
extreme vastness. 
I happen to live in a county that is in 
the middle of cattle country here in 
the United States, where we have less 
than one person per square mile and 
there are over 6,000 square miles in my 
county. We understand what being 
rural means. We understand the dif-
ferences that exist, not just within the 
State of Nebraska but that exist here 
in this country. We believe that diver-
sity needs to be recognized when we are 
talking about providing relief to fami-
lies, relief to small businesses, and re-
covery. 
First, we have to get to the relief. We 
can’t get on this bill right now. What I 
hear from my constituents, and I know 
all of you do—it doesn’t matter if you 
are a Republican or a Democrat. I 
know all of you are hearing from your 
constituents about how ridiculous we 
look because we can’t get on a bill for 
political reasons. 
I hope that, as we move forward, we 
are able to provide relief to families. 
People are in need. People are hurting. 
People are scared. And we are here 
talking—which is a good thing, if we 
come to a positive outcome—but we 
don’t have much time. We have small 
businesses across this country that are 
hurting. 
I have heard from my dentist. I have 
heard from my neighbors who are very 
concerned about what is going on and 
whether they are going to be able to 
provide for their employees, their fami-
lies and have a business to come back 
to. 
Yet, when you talk about livestock, I 
think Nebraskans have a good under-
standing of that because livestock is 
the economic engine in the State of Ne-
braska. It is the biggest revenue pro-
vider in agriculture in the State of Ne-
braska. It is a part of that ag economy 
that drives our State’s economy, which 
is why working on provisions that are 
going to help producers will help every 
single person in my State. 
My office reached out to numbers of 
my friends and neighbors who are fam-
ily ranchers and family farmers, and 
we asked them what is going on. The 
Senator from North Dakota talked 
about the losses—the extreme losses— 
that we are looking at. When I talk 
about farmers and ranchers, I am talk-
ing about family farmers and family 
ranchers and how people are looking at 
their families, their neighbors, and 
their communities. The coronavirus is 
adding another dimension to an al-
ready battered agriculture economy. 
This disease has been driving down 
crop and livestock prices. Therefore, I 
am adamant that, in this bill, we have 
to provide relief to address that. 
As for my colleague from North Da-
kota, who has led on this and come up 
with a solution that will help families, 
neighborhoods, communities, and my 
State, I thank him, for we have seen ag 
futures that have been dropping since 
February. Prices that have been offered 
for ranchers’ cattle have been drop-
ping. Ethanol plants are starting to 
idle, and they are starting to close 
down across the country. There is a lot 
of unsold grain that is sitting out in 
the countryside or that is in farm stor-
age right now. 
As for the cattle—and I can speak to 
this—we have seen large volumes of ne-
gotiated cattle being procured at lower 
prices. We have seen a sharply rising 
boxed beef market both in volume and 
in price. As of last Thursday, cattle 
volume at live auctions declined by 75 
percent, which is due to the folks who 
are practicing social distancing. That, 
in turn, has caused a $10 to $15 drop in 
the market price. 
Feeder cattle sales have slowed down. 
If you drive around counties in my 
State, where we see a lot of fed cattle, 
you will see empty pens. Feeders are 
getting hit twice and, arguably, the 
hardest. Suppliers, which include eth-
anol plants, are telling feeders that 
they have, maybe, 1 to 2 weeks max in 
which they can provide feed to them, 
and then those family farms are going 
to be in trouble because those ethanol 
plants are going to idle or they are 
going to shut down, which is going to 
cause feeders to worry about supply. 
The panic buying that we are seeing 
in the news can be correlated back to 
that high volume of beef that is being 
sold. We can see packers that are sell-
ing large volumes of beef with out-
standing consumer demand. As a cattle 
rancher, you want to see that con-
sumer demand but not in these times 
that are so uncertain. We have had 
packers communicate that they are 
going to continue to ramp up produc-
tion. We are grateful for that, and it is 
needed to meet that high demand. 
Beef sales are increasing, as are 
boxed beef prices, and producers need 
to be able to share in the price gains of 
this unexpected surge in demand. In re-
ality, the opposite has been happening. 
I have been working with my col-
leagues on measures that are in the 
CARES Act that will provide some re-
lief to people in my State and across 
the heartland who are working to keep 
the world fed during this pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1933 
March 23, 2020 
The provision that we have in this 
current version of the bill will help to 
provide relief to cow-calf producers and 
feeders through the Commodity Credit 
Corporation, the CCC, which we have 
talked about, so we can have that in-
crease so that livestock—beef, pork, 
poultry—can be included, which can 
also assist other commodities. This 
provision is needed. These dollars are 
the vehicle that we can use to help our 
producers get the relief they need dur-
ing these tough times. 
There are so many times I hear from 
my neighbors that we leave agriculture 
out all the time; that we don’t think 
about rural America. We do. We always 
do. Yet to listen to colleagues on the 
other side put off a vote is appalling. 
People are suffering, and people must 
be helped. We need to be here to pro-
vide relief and to have a plan for recov-
ery. We have that. We worked in a bi-
partisan way to have it. Agriculture 
must be a part of that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Nebraska for her very 
powerful and heartfelt comments. I 
have to say she knows of what she 
speaks. In her coming from Nebraska 
and being in agriculture, nobody sees it 
out there more directly or understands 
more what our farmers and ranchers 
are going through than she does. I real-
ly do appreciate her comments. I think 
she brings home very clearly how we 
need to make sure that our farmers 
and ranchers are part of this important 
effort as we seek to battle this pan-
demic. Again, I can’t thank her enough 
for her heartfelt comments. 
I turn now to our colleague from the 
State of Mississippi for her comments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as 
we continue to navigate this unprece-
dented position we find ourselves in be-
cause of this extremely contagious 
virus, I want to bring one issue to the 
attention of all of my colleagues. 
Anyone who has been on social media 
has seen the empty shelves in the gro-
cery stores throughout the country. 
The last shortage we need right now is 
with our American farmers. We are 
going to be able to feed this country 
but only if we keep the farmers in busi-
ness. With virtually every restaurant 
in this country now being on shutdown, 
we have never found ourselves here. 
They are not ordering the food they 
normally order because they are on 
shutdown. We are here, in the city of 
Washington, DC, and have every res-
taurant closed except for a few for 
takeout, which is one market our farm-
ers have just lost with our being in the 
position that we are in. We don’t need 
to be. We have to make sure our food 
production continues. 
As the former agriculture commis-
sioner of the wonderful State of Mis-
sissippi, I can speak to this firsthand. 
When this market slows down, it 
doesn’t move the needle a little bit; it 
moves the needle a lot. The emergency 
supplemental appropriations portion— 
division B of the phase 3 coronavirus 
legislation—provides that critical sup-
port for American farmers and ranch-
ers who are truly being impacted by 
this virus. It is an important provision 
that the Democrats seem to oppose but 
that is just a no-brainer for me. 
Firstly, it reimburses the USDA’s 
CCC that we have referred to, which is 
the Commodity Credit Corporation, in 
order to prevent any delays in program 
funding that is vital to U.S. agri-
culture. 
The second thing it does is to tempo-
rarily raise the CCC’s borrowing au-
thority to ensure that the USDA has 
the resources it needs to assist pro-
ducers during this COVID–19 emer-
gency. This is just basic economics. 
People come to the floor, and they 
talk about all of these programs that 
we need to be increasing right now. 
The Democrats want billions for do-
mestic food programs, but what hap-
pens when those who are supplying our 
food go out of business? This is a $1 
trillion-plus package, and as the dear 
Senator from Nebraska stated, we can-
not leave our farmers and ranchers 
out—the backbone of rural America. 
I look at the Democrats’ bill, and 
they are calling for the workers first. 
There is nobody working any harder 
right now to feed this country or to 
feed those medical workers who are 
being pushed beyond restraints to 
which they should never have to be 
pushed but who are willing to step up 
because they are within the medical 
community that is willing to take care 
of these patients. Every small business 
has employees, and they are going to 
have to be fed. We have to ensure that 
we continue to have the safest food 
supply—and cheapest, I might add—of 
anywhere in the entire world. 
I appreciate the work of Chairman 
HOEVEN and others of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Agriculture for 
including this in this bill—this provi-
sion that is very vital. It has to remain 
in there. 
I just want to stress the importance 
of making sure the farmers and ranch-
ers can continue to do what they were 
born to do, including those wonderful 
farmers and ranchers in the State of 
Mississippi and throughout this coun-
try, and that is to produce our ag prod-
ucts in order to make sure this country 
will continue to sustain itself. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Mississippi, who un-
derstands agriculture, is a strong advo-
cate for agriculture, and recognizes 
how critically important it is. 
At this point, I turn to our chairman 
of the Ag Committee. He is somebody 
who has been around agriculture for a 
long, long time. He has worked on 
many, many farm bills, and whether it 
is livestock or crops or specialty 
crops—across 
the 
board—he 
under-
stands. 
I say that for this reason: The provi-
sion that we have put in here helps all 
of ag. It is designed for all of agri-
culture. Certainly, it is absolutely 
vital for our cattle ranchers to help 
them in their working with the USDA, 
but it is for all of these other crops, 
too, across this great country, and 
there is incredible diversity in agri-
culture. What we have tried to do here 
is to make sure we have something 
that enables our Department of Agri-
culture and this body to help all of our 
producers. Without this, we are not 
able to do that, and that is why it is so 
vital that it is part of this package. 
With that, I turn to our committee 
chairman. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. 
ROBERTS. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
thank the Senator for yielding to me. 
As has been aptly pointed out by 
Senator HOEVEN, who, by the way, does 
an outstanding job as our protector on 
the all-powerful Senate Appropriations 
Committee, we are in a tough place. We 
really are—rural, smalltown America— 
given the rural healthcare delivery sys-
tem with regard to this virus. 
I thank Senator FISCHER, who is in 
the business and always does a good job 
of telling the story of the beef producer 
and of always trying to tell me that 
Nebraska’s beef is more tender or deli-
cious than the beef in Kansas, but that 
is her right. 
As Senator HYDE-SMITH
has just 
pointed out and what we have been try-
ing to point out—and Senator STABE-
NOW, who just recently spoke on the 
floor—we on the Ag Committee like to 
say we are the least partisan com-
mittee in the Congress. I think that 
was evident by the time we passed the 
farm bill. It took us a year to do it—a 
little over that—but we got 87 votes. It 
was truly bipartisan. I deeply regret 
that we have reached a point here in 
the Senate where that is not the case 
with regard to the whole Senate. 
If you talk to any agriculture com-
modity group, any farm organization, 
or just up and down Main Street 
throughout Kansas—as a matter of 
fact, I talked to the chamber of com-
merce, Senator MORAN, who just gave 
some very pertinent comments to our 
situation out in Kansas, about the sec-
ond question in: Chairman PAT, what 
about our rural areas? 
Well, at that time, we were having 
trouble with regard to the testing, and 
some rural hospitals were having to 
drive a great deal of miles to Topeka. 
That 
was 
the 
only 
source. 
That 
stopped. In other words, it hasn’t 
stopped, it has gotten a heck of a lot 
better, with Quest and LabCorp and 
other folks who are now making these 
tests available. 
But I want to get back to agri-
culture, and the Senator from North 
Dakota is exactly right—we have been 
hit pretty hard. Two thousand thirteen 
was the last time we had our prices 
above the cost of production, and that 
involves everybody involved in agri-
culture, along with Senator THUNE.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1934 
March 23, 2020 
I am going to try to wind this down 
here pretty quick so we can get to you, 
Coop, and I thank you for your help, 
and I thank you for your overview of 
what is in this bill, what isn’t in this 
bill, and why on Earth we can’t get to 
it. 
So I think probably the best thing to 
do for our beef industry is to continue 
to work with our Secretary of Agri-
culture, Sonny Perdue. If there is any-
body who is more knowledgeable about 
what we are facing, I don’t know who it 
is. And I think possibly there could be 
a CCC payment that would help us out 
in the beef industry in particular be-
cause that is where we are really in 
trouble. But you could go down every 
commodity, and you would see the 
same thing. People from all of their or-
ganizations are coming forward to all 
of us on the Ag Committee and saying: 
Why can’t you help? 
I am going to leave that subject. I 
think we can work on that. I think we 
can get some more help from CCC, and 
that would be a direct payment that 
would be immediate and that could be 
of help to people who are really in 
trouble. 
I want to say something else with re-
gard to Senator MANCHIN, who is sit-
ting over here by his lonesome on the 
other side of the aisle. I really like this 
guy. We are good friends. We hit it off 
right from the first. Both of us want 
the same thing. In particular, his com-
ments this morning were about the 
rural healthcare delivery system in 
West Virginia going through the same 
tribulation that we are going through 
nationwide with regard to our rural 
areas. 
I want to point out that there is $75 
billion in this bill for our rural hos-
pitals to pay doctors and nurses who 
are dealing with the virus. Well, we all 
are doing that. 
It lifts the 2-percent sequester that 
happens all the time. You have to go 
back to 2013, and under the Budget 
Control Act that was passed at that 
particular time—not in force but at 
least was—what is the word for it? Re-
ferring to President Obama, he would 
always be under the Budget Control 
Act, finding the necessity that—no 
matter what we got from the CMS, the 
Centers for Medicare Services, which is 
lovingly called in our rural areas ‘‘It’s 
a Mess’’—not under Seema Verma, 
though. I think she is doing a good job. 
But every time we would convince CMS 
to raise the Medicare reimbursement 
to critical access hospitals, of which we 
have over 80 in Kansas, there was, 
again, that 2-percent cut. So we waived 
that cut for the first time since 2013. 
In addition, let me say that there is 
special funding called for by all of the 
community 
healthcare 
centers 
and 
rural health centers—of which I know 
there are a lot in West Virginia, as 
there well are in Kansas—for telemedi-
cine. That was something back in the 
day 
that 
we 
couldn’t 
even 
have 
thought would be feasible, but it is 
now. There is a 15-percent reimburse-
ment increase for these folks who are 
using telemedicine. 
So it is not like we haven’t put to-
gether something we think will be ap-
proved. We could do more. We could do 
more, and the Senator from West Vir-
ginia has certainly indicated a strong 
interest in doing that. My point is, we 
could do that if we would just vote to 
get on the bill, and we would have 30 
hours. I know that Senator MANCHIN 
and Senator ROBERTS, working to-
gether, could accomplish darn near ev-
erything. 
I see the Senator rising. I am not 
quite through. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Would the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, if you have to. 
You are my distinguished friend. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Well, truly, we are 
friends, and there is not a person over 
there I don’t consider my dear friend. A 
lot of times, that is used in a very col-
loquial way, but I mean it. 
The Senator from Nebraska, let me— 
from Kansas—let me just say this. Ex-
cuse me for pronouncing the wrong 
State here. You don’t have a problem 
on this side with the 30-hour wait. That 
has never been. We very seldom object 
on anything. That is not where the 
problem comes from. So everyone 
thinking that we are going to make ev-
erybody stay here for 30 hours—that is 
not going to happen from the Demo-
crats objecting. We will not. There is 
not a person I have spoken to who is 
going to stop it. What they want to do 
is, in good faith, get to the bill. Once 
we get to that bill—and in the mean-
time, they said: Well, let’s get on the 
bill. Can’t we at least get on it and 
work on it? Usually we don’t move to 
that unless there is good faith in the 
beginning. Right now, there is very lit-
tle good faith there from the top end of 
the food chain. That is the sad scenario 
we are in. 
But I can assure you, as soon as there 
is an agreement, we are moving, unless 
somebody on your side would object. 
There are no objections on this side. So 
I would hope that you all you would 
not use that 30-hour obstruction be-
cause it is not here. 
I will have a chance to speak about 
this more, but I just thank you because 
I know rural—your State is rural, my 
State is rural, and it is the same. These 
people are out there, and they are de-
pending on us, and we have to get to-
gether here as Americans. 
Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate your 
comments. I guess it is OK to call you 
Joe. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Please. 
Mr. ROBERTS. And I appreciate your 
friendship. 
You did mention something else 
about, there is no objection on your 
side. Well, about 2 hours ago, when we 
got this whirlwind or this dustup going 
again, when our distinguished leader 
pointed out that we have a good bill, 
and it is a bipartisan bill, and now we 
are talking about the footprint that 
the airlines—the carbon footprint, that 
we have to take a look at that, and on 
the boards of these corporations, we 
want to investigate whether they are 
truly diverse, et cetera, et cetera, and 
something about the Green New Deal. 
That is not pertinent to this particular 
situation, to say the least. 
Then when you said an objection, 
here is what I am worried about: We 
had the Democratic leader, whom I 
have known from his House days—we 
used to play basketball together, for 
goodness’ sake, both of us very slow. 
What I was doing on the court at my 
age, I have no idea. My job was to set 
blind-side picks on Democrats, which I 
enjoy, one of whom was CHUCK SCHU-
MER. 
But here we have the Democratic 
leader—SUSAN
COLLINS, sitting right 
here, stood up to be recognized, and 
there were three objections to her even 
talking? That is going back to the days 
we really don’t want to go back to. 
This is not the Senate I came to 24 
years ago or, for that matter, the 
House 16 years ago or as a staff direc-
tor for 12 before that and 2 before that 
in the Senate. I mean, I have been 
around here for quite a while. And 
these are not the worst of times. I 
mean, Washington was on fire when we 
had the horrible assassination of MLK. 
Then we went through Watergate, and 
then we went through the Vietnam 
war. Actually, it was the Vietnam war 
before Watergate. And that tore the 
country apart. Here in this Senate, we 
were able to come together to try to 
reach bipartisan agreement. 
I am telling you that this blanket of 
comity and respect is pretty thread-
bare right now. We are right there—for 
a lot of reasons. I could go back to the 
Kavanaugh hearings or the impeach-
ment hearings, where one of the House 
Members—I was sitting right here, he 
was talking right here, looking right at 
me, and said: You are on trial, and if 
you do not vote for this, it is treach-
ery. I said: What? Me? I mean, what 
was that all about? 
At that time, by the way, we could 
have taken first steps with regard to 
this virus. 
I know that the assistant or the dep-
uty leader there on your side said: Ev-
erybody take a deep breath. We don’t 
want to take a deep breath anywhere 
now. But I will tell you that I hope we 
can come together on this and see if we 
can’t reach some agreement. Let’s get 
on the bill. We have got 30 hours to do 
it. 
The Senator from West Virginia said 
that if we could just come to an agree-
ment—I suppose he is meaning beyond 
those two doors. We have been meeting 
along and along and along. 
I would ask the Senator, the distin-
guished Senator who is sitting right 
down here, who is about ready to do a 
speech, how many workshops have we 
had? I thought there were three. I 
guess there are five. But each one of 
them worked with our Democratic 
counterparts, and they got—I mean, 
they produced a bipartisan agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1935 
March 23, 2020 
I really don’t understand why we 
can’t get to at least vote for cloture, 
and then we have 30 hours to—and 
maybe we could cut back that 30 hours. 
I would hope that is the case if we fi-
nally come to an agreement. But with 
some of the things that I have heard 
that you want put in this bill, A, they 
don’t fit, and two, they are counter-
productive. 
Let me just say this. There is a say-
ing out in Dodge City, KS: There is a 
lot of cactus in the world; you don’t 
have to sit on every one of them. And 
it appears to me that is what we are 
doing. 
I have a nice square saying that is in 
an 8-by-10 right next to my desk, and it 
is a quote from Lyndon Baines John-
son: ‘‘Sometimes you just have to hun-
ker down like a jackass in a hailstorm 
and just take it.’’ Well, I am tired of 
just taking it. I am tired of the par-
tisanship. I am tired of all of this work 
that we have put together to address 
what everybody understands is a na-
tional pandemic—a world pandemic— 
and here we are, messing around, try-
ing to say: Oh, no, we can’t vote for 
cloture and address some of these 
things with the now five working 
groups who have worked together to 
produce a product. That is wrong. That 
is really wrong. 
So I plead with my colleagues. I don’t 
do this. I don’t come down to the floor 
and make partisan speeches. You do 
that to introduce an amendment; half 
of your folks won’t vote for it. The 
same thing the other way around. 
When they say ‘‘Senator Roberts,’’ I 
hope they remember that I am chair-
man of the Ag Committee, and I work 
very well with Senator STABENOW, and 
we produced a great farm bill. So I 
don’t like doing this. But I have to 
warn my colleagues, this so-called 
blanket of comity that we always have 
here in the Senate is pretty thread-
bare. I hope we can get past this, and I 
hope we can vote to get to cloture and 
then get to a bill as soon as we can. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I want to thank the 
senior Senator from Kansas for his 
comments and for his long service on 
behalf of agriculture, and I want to 
thank all of my colleagues who have 
spoken here. These are people who are 
working every day on behalf of our 
farmers and ranchers and on ag and on 
the Agriculture Committee. 
We fashioned something here that 
works for agriculture. Our message is 
very simple: We need to make sure our 
farmers and ranchers are included in 
this bill, and we need our colleagues 
across the aisle to work with us to 
make sure it is in the bill, and we need 
to get this bill passed now. 
With that, I would like to turn to our 
assistant majority leader—also from ag 
country—for concluding remarks. I ap-
preciate the patience of our colleague 
from West Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from North Dakota for 
his great leadership on this issue and 
all over here. 
Senator 
ROBERTS—the 
longtime 
chairman of the Senate Ag Committee 
and before that, the House Ag Com-
mittee—was very instrumental in our 
getting a farm bill in late 2018—a farm 
bill which provides a safety net and 
provides a little bit of stability in agri-
culture, which, as he pointed out, has 
been just in the tank literally since 
2013. 
Our producers, farmers, and ranchers 
across the country and in South Da-
kota have been operating with negative 
cash flows, eating into their equity, 
and trying to keep their operations 
viable, and that was before COVID–19. 
Now we have COVID–19, and we saw the 
bottom fall out of the cattle market in 
this country. 
I don’t have to tell the Presiding Of-
ficer that agriculture is important. It 
is the lifeblood of our economy in 
South Dakota. It is our No. 1 industry. 
But that ripple effect is felt all across 
the country. It is our food supply. Sen-
ator HOEVEN talked earlier today about 
the importance of ensuring that we 
maintain a safe, quality, predictable, 
and affordable food supply for people in 
this country, particularly when people 
are concerned in a time of crisis. We 
need to maintain that food supply. So 
I want to thank him and all of our col-
leagues here from farm country for 
working together to provide some as-
sistance in this particular bill, which 
would hopefully give some relief for 
those who are out there, day in and day 
out, grinding it out to make sure we 
have the food and fiber to keep this 
country going and, for that matter, to 
feed the world. 
Unfortunately, again, Senate Demo-
crats don’t seem willing to do that. I 
was encouraged to hear just a little bit 
ago from my friend from West Virginia, 
who is an advocate for agriculture. We 
also had the ranking member of the Ag 
Committee down here earlier, saying 
she is willing to work with us. But, un-
fortunately, we don’t have time to 
waste. We don’t have time to waste. 
This isn’t something that can be put 
off to another day. We have producers 
that, if we don’t do something, we are 
going to leave them behind, and we 
need our Democratic colleagues to step 
up and help get this bill passed. 
As Senator HOEVEN mentioned, the 
bill would provide $30 billion to replen-
ish the Commodity Credit Corporation, 
and it has a temporary funding in-
crease of an additional $20 billion in 
CCC funding to address the impact of 
the outbreak of COVID–19. This fund-
ing would allow the Department of Ag-
riculture to quickly get assistance to 
farmers 
and 
ranchers 
throughout 
America who are facing market vola-
tility and declining pricing in the wake 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. Farmers 
and ranchers, I might add, as I already 
mentioned, were already dealing with a 
weak ag economy well before this 
emergency hit. 
I spoke with the Secretary of Agri-
culture a couple of days ago and con-
veyed to him the incredible amount of 
hardship and economic pain that is 
being created across the farm belt 
these days, particularly with our cattle 
ranchers, and the pain they are feeling 
as a result of these declining prices and 
what it might mean to their oper-
ations. 
So I would simply say, in supporting 
all of my colleagues in what they said 
today, that we don’t know the full im-
pact of this outbreak across the agri-
cultural industry, but we do know this: 
Our producers are doing their part to 
keep the grocery shelves stocked and 
food on our tables, and we need to do 
our part in providing the resources nec-
essary to support them, which is why it 
is so important for many of the reasons 
we talked about earlier today to get on 
this legislation and get it moving. 
The national economy is melting 
down, and, of course, as I said, in the 
economy out in farm country, it was 
happening well before the national 
economy. But if we don’t do something 
to stop the bleeding and do it soon, 
there is going to be a whole world of 
hurt. Let’s get this bill across the fin-
ish line. We need help from our Demo-
cratic colleagues to do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank all of my colleagues, who 
truly are all my friends, who are here 
expressing their concerns. I think we 
are all on the same side. I think that 
for every one of you and me and every-
body within the House and Senate, we 
have this disease in our States and we 
have it in our neighborhoods and back-
yards. This COVID–19 doesn’t know 
whether you are a Democrat, a Repub-
lican, or an Independent. People are 
scared right now. 
We have States that are sheltering in 
place. My State just announced that at 
12 or 1 p.m. today, they are going to 
shelter in place, and I have a very vul-
nerable population I am concerned 
about. 
I 
have 
a 
very 
vulnerable 
healthcare system I am very much con-
cerned about, because if they are not 
able to provide the services we are 
going to need and that we need now, 
then, Good Lord, help us all. We will be 
in trouble then. We are going to pro-
tect them, and that is what we are 
fighting for. 
I know they are talking about this: 
Why are the Democrats stalling just to 
get on the bill? If we just got on the 
bill, everything would be fine. 
How can we? For people to under-
stand how this process works, we usu-
ally have an agreement before we get 
on a vote to pass something. If there is 
not an agreement, then, there is polit-
ical posturing. That is what is hap-
pening. The political posturing is going 
on because they know there is a dif-
ference. So where can the pressure be 
put? 
I have been here for 10 years, and I 
have never seen the place work at all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1936 
March 23, 2020 
So I appreciate those of you who give 
me some historical values on how it 
used to work. I wish it did. I always 
thought that when there was good 
faith, whether I agreed or not, you 
could have a chance to amend the bill 
or change the bill or do something to 
it. We don’t get that chance here. So if 
we start moving before we have an 
agreement, then there is going to be no 
conciliatory movement toward some-
thing to then make it happen. 
Where are we at right now? Let me 
state something with regard to the $500 
billion in that bill. I don’t know wheth-
er it is $1.3 trillion or $2 trillion, but I 
know it is moving up rapidly. But in 
$500 billion of it that we can basically 
identify, this is where I have had some 
problems in what I understand. 
First of all, there is no strong lan-
guage 
that 
prohibits 
the 
stock 
buybacks. I know they keep saying cor-
porate bailouts. OK, forget about the 
bailouts, but you tell me if this is not 
pretty favorably slanted to one side. 
There is no strong language to prohibit 
stock 
buybacks. 
As 
written, 
the 
buyback limitation can be waived by 
Secretary Mnuchin. Secretary Mnuchin 
can direct funds to whom he sees as 
necessary but with very, very little 
oversight. 
There is no restraint on taking the 
assistance and firing employees at a 
later time, as employers only have to 
keep employees ‘‘to the extent pos-
sible,’’ which is in the language. These 
are the concerns. 
The bill allows for a 6-month delay 
on releasing the names of businesses. 
Tell me why we would put a 6-month 
delay on releasing the names of busi-
nesses that take advantage and get 
this 
economic 
opportunity. 
Why 
shouldn’t we be transparent? 
There is only a 2-year prohibition on 
increasing executive compensation. We 
have seen what happens when it runs 
amuck. Those are the concerns we 
have. Those are the concerns I have. 
With that, let’s take the measures we 
agree on. We agree we should be pro-
tecting the healthcare industry. We 
have agreed on $100 billion. We were 
way off from that, but, finally, by not 
agreeing to move on to the bill, it is 
now up to $75 billion. I think when we 
come out this afternoon, there will be 
$100 billion to take care of our hos-
pitals, our rural and other healthcare 
systems, so they can survive, making 
sure that all of our healthcare pro-
viders are protected. These are the 
things that we are talking about and 
the things we have asked for. 
So they start saying: Oh, just get on 
the bill. Yes, just get on the bill. 
And then what happens? Nothing else 
happens, because then it is out of our 
jurisdiction, if you will, because we 
have little chance to intervene. The 
rules are that, basically, the majority 
has the rule. They can rule, and that is 
exactly how it works. So, we are trying 
to get a bill. 
There is no need for us to take a vote 
today because we are still working on 
it. I know the Secretary of Treasury is 
in there working on it. They are all sit-
ting there working on it. Why would 
we have a vote when we knew we didn’t 
have an agreement? But we are getting 
close to one, and if we get an agree-
ment, I will state that every Democrat 
will vote to suspend the rules, and we 
will move immediately, unless there is 
an objection from my friends on the 
Republican side. 
That is what we are talking about. 
Please, let’s quit blaming each other. 
People are depending in my State on 
our taking care of healthcare workers, 
taking care of people laid off and who 
don’t have a paycheck through no fault 
of their own. Businesses have had to 
close through no fault of their own. 
Those are the people on the frontlines. 
I have people scared and sheltered in 
place right now, an elderly population. 
So there are things we have agreed 
on. I heard Senator LANKFORD from 
Oklahoma, who was speaking on the 
things that I agree on 1,000 percent 
with him. Why can’t we be on that? If 
we can’t get anything else done, let’s 
vote today on the things we can agree 
on. Let’s move on the healthcare, take 
care of COVID–19, and take care of the 
healthcare industry and the workers 
and take care of the people who lost 
their jobs and businesses. 
We are worried about a $500 billion 
payout with very little oversight and 
transparency. That is truly the prob-
lem in a nutshell, and all we are asking 
for, basically, is, Shouldn’t the people 
and the taxpayers of this country un-
derstand where their money is going 
and the people who are going to be able 
to use it? Add some transparency and 
oversight to it. That is all we ask for, 
and that is all I ask for. 
About all those other things that 
have been thrown in, I am not for that, 
and I think you all know that. I am not 
for the green deal, and I think you all 
know that. I think there has to be an 
all-in energy policy approach. I think 
we all have to have common sense, and 
we have to produce affordable, depend-
able energy and use everything we 
can—renewables and using fossil fuels 
in the cleanest possible way. So who is 
throwing that stuff in? I have no idea, 
but I can guarantee I wouldn’t vote for 
it. But what I will vote for is exactly 
what we should agree on and what I 
think we do agree on. 
Let’s come together as Americans 
and 
forget 
about 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats and get this place working 
again. If we had the amendment proc-
ess—I was totally opposed when Sen-
ator Reid basically kind of shut things 
down and we weren’t able to have 
amendments. You all were, too. We 
were promised that no matter who 
takes over leadership, by golly, the 
system is going to open up, and we are 
going to have amendments and debates 
on the floor. And guess what. It got 
worse. It didn’t get better. It got worse. 
If you want to know why people are 
throwing everything but the kitchen 
sink into a piece of legislation, it is be-
cause they have very little opportunity 
to do anything here. There is too much 
power in the two basic leaderships. 
This much power should not be in so 
few people. All of us should be in-
volved. 
I believe—and I have said this—that 
we all have that better angel inside of 
us. I hope you let her fly. I hope you let 
her fly today. She needs to get out and 
go a little bit. We need her. We need 
the better angels in all of us to start 
looking out and taking care of each 
other. There are a lot of people hurting 
and a lot of people with uncertainty 
right now, and I want to make sure 
that we fix it. I will stay here all day 
and all night to make sure it gets 
fixed—whatever it takes. 
With that, I ask all of my good 
friends—and I mean that, all my good 
friends—let’s work together for the 
sake of this great country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I just 
heard my friend and colleague from 
West Virginia say there is no reason to 
vote today. There are a lot of reasons 
to vote today. There is a country af-
fected by disease. People are waking up 
anxious, scared, afraid of the disease 
and the economic consequences that 
are there. There are a lot of reasons to 
vote today. 
Every Member of this Senate needs 
to stand up and be counted, and for the 
Senator from West Virginia to say: I 
wouldn’t be for this, and I don’t know 
where that is coming from—well, just 
read the papers that are coming out of 
the Democratic House. Just read the 
papers of the demands by the Demo-
crats to muck up the bill that is de-
signed as a rescue operation for the 
American people. That is where the 
problem is. We need to vote today, 
again and again and again, until we 
provide the relief, the rescue that the 
American people need. 
That is why we have a dozen Repub-
licans on this side ready to speak, 
standing at podiums ready to speak, 
and there hasn’t been a single Demo-
crat on the floor to defend their posi-
tion because it is indefensible. That is 
where we are. 
We have NANCY PELOSI flying back 
from California because she sent the 
House home a week ago—they are not 
here—to defeat the work that we have 
done in a bipartisan way, and to say: 
Well, all of you have done nice work. 
Now look at our laundry list of things 
we are demanding: tax credits for solar 
panels, wind turbines, a bailout of the 
Postal Service. And when you go 
through this list, there are portions of 
the Green New Deal. 
I am a doctor. I have been on the 
phone with doctors around the country, 
with my colleagues at the Wyoming 
Medical Center. They are working dou-
ble time, through the weekend, day and 
night—the nurses, the doctors, the 
healthcare providers—and they need 
help. They are looking to us for help.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1937 
March 23, 2020 
They need tests, they need masks, they 
need respirators, and they need hope— 
hope that there will be a vaccine, hope 
that there will be a treatment. Those 
are the things that are in this bill that 
the Democrats voted to block last 
night and the Democrats voted to 
block again today, and that is only the 
healthcare component of it. 
Our economy cannot be unleashed 
again until after we get the healthcare 
component behind us. But our col-
leagues, our friends, our neighbors, 
people we know in our home States 
woke up today not being able to go to 
work, not being able to know if they 
are going to have a paycheck, not 
being able to pay their bills, not being 
able to know if they are going to feed 
their families, not being able to know 
that they are going to get food, if it is 
available, if they could have the money 
to pay for it. Yet we are not ready to 
provide relief. 
They need it immediately. They 
don’t need it after the Democrats block 
it again and again and again. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia said: I don’t 
know why we voted today. 
That is why we voted today, and that 
is why we need to keep voting, because 
the American people need relief and 
they need it now. 
This is our duty station, and I am 
prepared to stay here until we get this 
done—but to go through this. 
I talked to a small business owner 
who has a restaurant and has been 
there for 37 years. She doesn’t know 
how she is going to make payroll. She 
never closed the doors except for snow-
storms in Wyoming. It is a successful 
restaurant. She doesn’t know how she 
is going to pay for the food that was 
delivered last week. She doesn’t know 
how she is going to pay for healthcare. 
This bill takes care of so much of that. 
It was blocked by the Democrats 
today. 
We have a good program for small 
businesses. It is really good. It was 
worked on in a bipartisan way, but yet 
it is being blocked by the Democrats. 
They blocked even the motion to pro-
ceed to the bill. 
Businesses all across the country em-
ploy people, regardless of the size. It is 
the people who need the jobs, the peo-
ple. A job is part of somebody’s iden-
tity. It is who they are. The people who 
work realize how important it is to 
who they are. They feel a sense of pro-
ductivity. People I know aren’t looking 
for a check. They just want a job. They 
want to work. They are ready to 
produce, and they can’t. Why? Because 
a disease has struck America, and the 
government—not 
the 
economy—the 
government has said ‘‘We are going to 
shut down this economy,’’ and the gov-
ernment has the responsibility to pro-
vide relief—to rescue those people and 
to provide immediate relief. Every 
Democrat came to the floor and voted 
against doing that last night and again 
this morning. We need to continue to 
vote. 
This bill is about our healthcare sys-
tem. It is about our economy. It is 
about money in the pockets of people 
who, through no fault of their own, are 
finding themselves in a position they 
have never been in before—ever—where 
they can’t go out and knock on the 
door and say: Will you hire me? I am 
ready to go to work. 
Whether it is a farmer or a rancher— 
anyone—they can’t do that today be-
cause the government says: You may 
not. You stay home. You might have 
had a good job, a job you love, and you 
can’t go to it today. Monday—we want 
everyone to work on a Monday but not 
in America on this Monday. 
So there is a role and responsibility 
for us to step in and do what the role 
of government ought to be in this case 
of crisis, a crisis caused by both a dis-
ease and the economy, the govern-
ment’s action to shut down the econ-
omy. Yet Democrats, one after an-
other, continue to block it. 
They are not blocking it for things 
that have to do with actually helping 
the American people. It is a wish list— 
a liberal wish list. It is astonishing 
that they are delaying direct assist-
ance so they can play to their liberal 
left—the 
extremists, 
the 
environ-
mental extremists, the labor special in-
terests. We are here trying to fight for 
the men and women in the street and 
our hometowns, yet they are fighting 
for the Green New Deal. BERNIE SAND-
ERS may have lost to Joe Biden, but 
the Green New Deal of BERNIE SANDERS 
and ELIZABETH WARREN and that entire 
crew is alive and well in the Demo-
cratic cloakroom and is controlling the 
actions today on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. 
They want to put up an entire cap- 
and-trade system for the airline indus-
try. That is a worthy debate to have, 
but not on this bill. They want to ex-
pand tax credits for wind and for solar 
power. That is a debate that is worthy 
of being held, but not on this bill 
today. That is not going to help one 
person who is having problems breath-
ing to get a respirator that they need. 
That is what is holding this up. 
We know NANCY
PELOSI
has been 
pushing this extreme environmental 
agenda from the moment she cut the 
deal to remain as Speaker and said to 
the liberals: I will do what you want if 
you just allow me to be Speaker again. 
And, now, through a letter that she has 
written to the Democrats, she is brag-
ging that she is carrying the flag for 
the Democratic agenda. The Speaker is 
pushing for diversity on corporate 
boards, for collective bargaining, and 
for election reform. There are pro-
posals here in her proposal—she said: I 
am going to go write the bill requiring 
early voting and requiring same-day 
voter registration. Where does that fit 
into a bill to rescue the American peo-
ple who, right now, find themselves in 
the throes of a disease that may kill 
them and in an economy that has been 
shut down? That is why the Democrats 
aren’t on this floor, because what they 
are doing cannot be defended. 
So, I would just say and I would ap-
peal to my colleagues: Let us do the 
work of the Senate. It is time for ev-
eryone to stand up and be responsible. 
Let us get this done. Let us get this 
passed. The days for political games 
are now behind us. 
Everyone who is watching should un-
derstand the House of Representatives 
is not in town. They have been gone for 
a week. Only NANCY PELOSI just flew 
back from California to throw a mon-
key wrench into the works, and we 
need to get this done. 
We failed the cloture vote last night, 
blocked by the Democrats, and at that 
time, we found that one of our col-
leagues 
had 
tested 
positive 
for 
coronavirus. We failed a cloture vote 
today, 
blocked 
by 
the 
Democrats 
again, when we learned that the spouse 
of one of our colleagues is hospitalized, 
on oxygen, with this same disease that 
is hitting the entire country. 
We can litigate the Green New Deal 
another day. Americans’ lives and live-
lihoods are at stake. That is the situa-
tion we are in today for the Nation. We 
can litigate election reform another 
day. We can debate diversity on cor-
porate boards and airline fuel stand-
ards; we can do all of that another day. 
We can talk about cap and trade an-
other day. 
America needs now to know how we, 
as a nation, will survive from the 
standpoint of our health and our econ-
omy. We need immediate relief. The 
bill on the floor accomplishes that. We 
need to make sure that, when Ameri-
cans wake up tomorrow, they don’t 
have that same fear and trepidation 
about the disease, as well as their fami-
lies’ well-being. We need to take that 
decisive action today. The time for pol-
itics is beyond us. We need to vote 
today, and we need to pass this today. 
I know my colleagues are on the 
floor. I know Senator PORTMAN is here 
after me and Senator COTTON
after 
him. We have a dozen who are ready to 
speak, but I thank you for your indul-
gence. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Wyoming, 
and I think he has made it very clear 
what is at stake here. We are in a cri-
sis. Our economy is in a free fall. The 
people we represent and families are 
suffering. The healthcare system is 
under tremendous stress. 
I spent the morning on the phone, 
talking to Ohioans and small business 
owners, people who are out of a job and 
worried and nervous. We all know 
somebody who has lost a job. We all 
know somebody who has tested posi-
tive for this virus. Some of us, includ-
ing me, know somebody who has died 
from the coronavirus. 
We need to pull together as Repub-
licans and Democrats, as Americans, 
and address this crisis. I got to listen 
this afternoon to colleagues of mine on 
the other side of the aisle talk about 
the legislation that is before us, and I 
have to tell you, it was like they were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1938 
March 23, 2020 
talking about another bill, not the one 
that we actually are asking Democrats 
to allow us to vote on. 
The one we are asking them to allow 
us to vote on is the product of a bipar-
tisan process. The majority leader set 
up five different task forces. Each task 
force is represented by Republicans and 
Democrats. I was in one of them—two 
Republicans and two Democrats. We 
sat down, and we hammered out de-
tails. We took Democratic ideas, and 
they are represented in the legislation. 
This process we have gone through— 
very different, by the way, from what 
happened in the House with regard to 
the first bill. We got an $8.3 billion 
healthcare bill. We also had a phase 2 
bill, which is about $200 billion, that 
provided free testing and health insur-
ance and healthcare and paid leave. 
Now we have this bill that is $1.8 tril-
lion—$1.8 trillion. That is about as big 
as our entire domestic discretionary 
spending, which we approve here every 
year. Yet Democrats are saying that it 
is not enough money. 
So the most charitable way to de-
scribe what the Democrats are asking 
for now—although Senator BARRASSO 
did a good job of laying out some of the 
outrageous demands that have come up 
that 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
coronavirus—but the most charitable 
way to say it is that they want more 
money. They want more money for 
States. They want more money for hos-
pitals. They want more money for so 
many things. 
Guess what. There is $1.8 trillion in 
this bill, including billions of dollars— 
hundreds of billions of dollars—for 
those purposes. If we find out in 3 
weeks, in 6 weeks, or in 2 months we 
need to do more, we will. But that is 
not an excuse for stopping the progress 
of this legislation now when it is so 
badly needed. 
One of the calls I got this morning 
was from a small business owner. Do 
you know what he said to me? He said 
the same thing I am sure all of my col-
leagues are hearing, which is this: I am 
watching; I am waiting; I don’t want to 
pull the trigger and let my employees 
go. I started this business. I started it 
from scratch, and now I have to see the 
prospect of these people, whom I know 
and love, losing their jobs. I am wait-
ing. I am waiting to see what you do 
today. 
The country is waiting. The markets 
are waiting. People are hurting. They 
are suffering, but they are waiting to 
see if we can get our act together and 
actually come up with something that 
helps them. And do you know what? 
This legislation does exactly what all 
of us, I thought, wanted to do. 
There are three things it does. One, it 
helps keep people at work. We want 
people to stay with their employer, 
have a job, have their healthcare, and 
have their retirement. Two, it helps 
workers who, through no fault of their 
own, lose their jobs. This legislation 
does that. And, three, let’s get this 
healthcare crisis under control. Let’s 
slow the spread of the coronavirus. All 
three of those things are precisely 
what is in this legislation. 
Last night, I went through in detail 
and described every detail of how it ad-
dresses that and where the bipartisan 
ideas came from. I won’t do that now 
because I see the majority leader on 
the floor, and I want him to have an 
opportunity to speak. But I will tell 
you, those three objectives are in this 
legislation—specifically laid out in this 
legislation. 
On the healthcare side, which is so 
important, we need more masks; we 
need more gowns; we need more ven-
tilators; we need more respirators; and 
we need to have more testing and a 
system to track that. That is in this 
legislation. There is over $4 billion to 
CDC to do exactly that. We need to 
have some data, some metrics, some 
measurements to know how we are 
doing and to be able to get out of this 
crisis because, until we deal with the 
healthcare crisis, we will continue to 
have this failure of our economic sys-
tem because we are letting people down 
right now. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Will the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. PORTMAN. I will yield. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, be-
yond what the Senator is accurately 
pointing out, they put us in the fol-
lowing procedural position. By refusing 
to jump over some of these procedural 
steps along the way—it would not dis-
advantage their negotiating one bit— 
they have put us in a position where 
one Senator 1 of 100—1—could keep us 
here until Friday or Saturday. 
Our constituents are saying to act 
now—as the Senator from Ohio was 
pointing out—minus procedural road-
blocks in a time of national emer-
gency. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, re-
claiming my time, that is added to the 
absolutely inaccurate descriptions I 
have heard from the other side as to 
what is in this legislation. 
In other words, they are blocking us 
from moving forward, creating the pro-
cedural hurdles that the majority lead-
er just talked about, but also doing so 
by telling the American people, for in-
stance, there is not enough in here for 
small businesses. My gosh, this is an 
unprecedented program for small busi-
nesses, something we have never done 
before. We are telling businesses: If you 
are paying your employees to stay 
there, you not only get a loan, you get 
a grant. 
They say there was not enough in 
here to help people who are falling be-
tween the cracks. It is an unprece-
dented unemployment insurance sys-
tem that we are setting up here. 
By the way, if you look at the unem-
ployment insurance side, look at it this 
way. What we are saying is that we 
want to increase by eight times the 
cost of the national unemployment in-
surance system. That is how I look at 
it. It is an additional $600 per week, per 
person. It is a broader employment sys-
tem because we are going to bring in 
people who are self-employed, people 
who run the gig economy—something 
that we should be doing as a matter of 
reform, perhaps, but in this case we 
have to do it. These people are hurting 
too. This is unprecedented to provide 
people who are low- and moderate-in-
come Americans the ability to have 
wage replacement through unemploy-
ment insurance. That has never been 
done before. That is in this legislation. 
This is a rescue package. It is to help 
people weather the storm. It is to en-
sure that we have the ability to say to 
the people who are calling us and say-
ing ‘‘Please help us’’ that help is on the 
way. 
Are we going to solve every problem 
in this one bill? No, although $1.8 tril-
lion goes a long way toward solving the 
problem. But we will be back here 
again. We will be back here to ensure 
that we can fine-tune this legislation. 
And if we need to react to other chal-
lenges, we have to do that because our 
constituents need it. This is a crisis. 
But in the meantime, let’s pass this 
legislation. It does help small busi-
nesses and keep people at work. It does 
protect those workers who lose their 
job through no fault of their own. It 
does take our healthcare system, which 
is under such tremendous stress, and 
improve it in every respect to deal with 
this coronavirus, to slow the spread 
and ensure that we can tell the Amer-
ican people: Not only are you going to 
be safer and healthier if this legislation 
passes, but guess what, you have a fair 
chance of keeping your job and being 
able to take care of your family. 
With that, I yield to my colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, let me 
just make clear what happened over 
the course of the last couple of days, 
because I heard many of my colleagues 
come down to the floor today and 
claim that this is a bipartisan bill that 
is on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
today, which would strike a lot of 
Americans as curious because the votes 
are not bipartisan, so how could that 
be? How could it be a bipartisan proc-
ess, as has been claimed by my Repub-
lican colleagues, yet there is not bipar-
tisan agreement? 
Well, let’s start from the beginning. 
Instead of deciding to write this legis-
lation from the beginning, with Repub-
licans and Democrats in the room, the 
leader decided to write the bill ini-
tially, bringing together a consensus of 
Republican Senators and then bringing 
Democrats to the table. And there was 
a period of time—for about 24 hours—in 
which Democrats were in the room, 
and we were making progress, and that 
was a great 24 hours. And then, on Sat-
urday night, all of a sudden, Democrats 
were let out of the room. And on Sun-
day morning, lobbyists on K Street 
sent a draft of legislation to chiefs of 
staff here that Democrats had no part 
in writing. So you can’t call it a bipar-
tisan piece of legislation if Democrats

weren’t involved in the beginning, and 
then they were let out of the room at 
the end. 
We appreciate having some input in 
the middle, but we clearly ended up 
with a product that doesn’t have bipar-
tisan buy-in, and much of that is be-
cause of the process that led us here. 
The decision could have been made to 
include both parties at the table from 
the very beginning because, guess 
what. We do have differences of opin-
ion. We do have different ways of look-
ing at this crisis. 
And our objections, our policy objec-
tions—I mean, spare me the righteous 
indignation about Democrats trying to 
settle outside political scores in the 
context of this legislation. Let me tell 
you what I care about. 
What I care about is making sure 
that if we are going to spend $2 trillion, 
we spend it wisely. And if you spend $2 
trillion, and you don’t stop the virus, 
then you haven’t done anything mean-
ingful in the long run because this is, 
first, a public health crisis that is caus-
ing an economic crisis. 
So, yes, one of the things that is an 
open issue in negotiations right now is 
whether we are putting in enough 
money for healthcare providers, nurs-
ing homes, hospitals, States, and mu-
nicipalities to give them the resources 
to stop this virus in its tracks. We 
don’t believe that this bill, today, has 
enough resources in it for States, mu-
nicipalities, hospitals, nursing homes, 
and healthcare providers to stop the 
virus. 
We don’t think that this Congress is 
serious enough about the crisis in the 
medical supply chain today, in which 
our States and our hospitals and our 
healthcare providers are engaged in a 
‘‘Lord 
of 
the 
Flies’’ 
environment, 
where they are trying to bid against 
each other for scarce medical supplies. 
We think this bill shortchanges the 
people who are actually going to stop 
this virus in its tracks. 
So, yes, we don’t think it is wise to 
rush to spend $2 trillion if the bill 
doesn’t stop the public health epi-
demic. That is a policy disagreement 
we have. It is a policy disagreement we 
have. And had Democrats been in the 
room with Republicans at the begin-
ning, middle, and end, we wouldn’t be 
here today. 
As many Republicans who want can 
come down to the floor and say that it 
is one party who is responsible for this 
impasse, but had Democrats not been 
ushered out of the negotiations on Sat-
urday night, had Democrats been there 
from the beginning, we likely wouldn’t 
be here. 
Second, yes, we do have policy dis-
agreements over how we spend the 
enormous amount of money that is 
going to end up in the hands of cor-
porations. And for those of us who were 
here in 2008, for those of us who voted 
for that bailout bill, we have regrets 
and reservations about how that went 
down because much of that money 
ended up in the pockets of CEOs and 
shareholders. 
Now, I get it. We want to get the 
money out fast, and you are not going 
to be able to account for every single 
dollar, but what we are talking about 
here, which is applying very minimal 
conditions for job retention to literally 
hundreds of billions of dollars of my 
taxpayer money, is not wise policy. 
If we don’t have assurances that the 
billions of dollars that we are going to 
hand to big companies is used to pre-
serve jobs, then I am going to tell you 
that my constituents don’t want to 
spend that money unless they know 
that it is going to hold on to jobs, and 
we have policy disagreements about 
that right now. 
I take my Republican friends at their 
word that they believe that the restric-
tions in the bill are good enough. We 
don’t think they are. We don’t think 
they are. And so we think we should 
work together throughout the day to 
get this right, to make sure that every 
dollar is there that is necessary to stop 
this virus, to stop looking at it as an 
economic crisis first and a public 
health crisis second, and that we 
should make sure that there are real 
requirements on this $2 trillion to 
make sure that it doesn’t end up in the 
hands of people who don’t need it; that 
it ends up protecting jobs—not just in 
the hope of protecting jobs but the ac-
tual result is protecting jobs. 
These are policy disagreements we 
have, but they are disagreements that 
we are still fighting over today because 
of the process—because of the process. 
So you are angry, and we are angry. 
We are angry for being shut out at the 
beginning, and we are angry for being 
shut out at the end. Our Republican 
colleagues knew they couldn’t pass 
anything without 60 votes. They knew, 
as they were developing this legisla-
tion, that they needed to get bipartisan 
buy-in. And yet there was a limited op-
portunity for us to have input here, 
and now we are engaged in a series of 
votes that are forgone conclusions 
until we get on the same page. 
And we can because, from what I un-
derstand—and I admit, I am not one of 
the negotiators in the room, but from 
what I understand, these are not 
unbridgeable differences. These are not 
unbridgeable differences. We can figure 
out a way to put tighter controls on 
the funding that is going to companies 
and corporations. Let’s just make sure 
that if we are going to spend $2 trillion, 
we spend it right and make sure we 
aren’t shortchanging our States and 
our hospitals. 
There are provisions in the first draft 
of this bill that would limit which kind 
of providers get Medicaid dollars and 
which will not. Our belief is that that 
language actually leaves a whole bunch 
of healthcare providers out in the cold. 
Now, some have said that was inten-
tional. That was because Republicans 
didn’t want Medicaid dollars to go to 
abortion providers. That sounds like 
politics to me, but that is just some-
thing I read in the paper. I don’t know 
that that is true. 
What I do know is that, whether or 
not that decision was about politics— 
the 
politics 
of 
reproductive 
healthcare—it still is just not good pol-
icy 
to 
leave 
a 
whole 
bunch 
of 
healthcare providers outside when it 
comes 
to 
the 
additional 
Medicaid 
money that is absolutely necessary to 
make sure we have what it takes to 
stand up defenses against this virus. 
That is a policy difference. 
I could sit here making accusations 
that Republicans are bringing outside 
political issues into this process, like 
Senator BARRASSO
made accusations 
about Democrats, but aside from that 
question, it just still is not good policy 
to limit the number of healthcare pro-
viders who can get this additional Med-
icaid money when everybody is in this 
together, when we know that every sin-
gle healthcare institution, by the end 
of this week, is going to be dealing 
with patients who have positive tests 
for COVID–19. 
These are policy differences but pol-
icy differences that didn’t have to be 
outstanding today had the process, run 
by the majority party, been different 
and been more inclusive. 
I agree that back home my constitu-
ents do not care about who takes credit 
for this and who drafts it. They want a 
bill done. They want assurances that 
money is on the way. 
I think we have agreement on big 
pieces of this. I may not love the small 
business provision of this bill. I put a 
different concept on the table that I 
think is better than the one my Demo-
cratic and Republican colleagues have 
come up with. But do you know what? 
On that front, I will not let the perfect 
be the enemy of the good. 
I think we have made tremendous 
progress on employment compensation 
insurance. There are big titles of this 
bill that I think are in good places. We 
should be working out the details of 
those outstanding issues right now 
rather than spending all of our time on 
the floor casting broadsides against 
each other. 
I understand my Republican col-
leagues are complimenting themselves 
on how many of them are down here on 
the floor blaming Democrats. You are 
right. There are not as many Demo-
crats here levying the same charges 
against Republicans, but it would be 
better if we were all spending time try-
ing to work out these final differences 
because we can get there. We can get 
there. 
I think we can get there by the end of 
the day if Republicans are committed 
to making sure that we attack the 
virus first, that we don’t shortchange 
the public health response, and that we 
make sure our taxpayers don’t end up 
subsidizing the profits and pocketbooks 
of people who don’t need any more help 
from this government. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.

try is facing a crisis. Maybe I don’t

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1940 
March 23, 2020 
need to whisper that. Our country is 
facing a crisis. 
I have served many times over— 
many times over—in crisis: floods, hur-
ricanes, and war in a slightly different 
suit. 
We are facing a crisis. We have three 
States that have had National Guards-
men 
activated 
in 
support 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. We are in a cri-
sis. And right now, right here in Con-
gress, we have the ability—the duty— 
to act and to provide additional, much 
needed relief to the American people. 
Last night, and, unfortunately, yet 
again today, have been very, very dis-
appointing displays of putting partisan 
politics ahead of the immediate needs 
of the American people. Now, some 
would call this righteous indignation. I 
say, no, it is fighting for the American 
people. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle delayed—no, let’s say it the way 
it is. They blocked—they blocked—this 
package to move to cloture to further 
debate this bill, this bipartisan relief 
package. 
Let me make this clear. The votes we 
have been taking haven’t even been on 
the final bill. It is simply a way for us 
to continue negotiating and debating 
on a path forward on a bipartisan relief 
package—a package that, again—I am 
going to echo what my colleague from 
Ohio said—was written in a bipartisan 
way, two Republicans and two Demo-
crats from those lead committees as-
signed to these task forces. 
Folks, Iowans deserve better than 
this. All Americans deserve better than 
this. This is no time for political games 
and partisan wish lists—and, yes, there 
are partisan wish lists out there—of 
things that have nothing to do with the 
immediate needs of this pandemic. 
This is a time for action, folks, and it 
is a time for leadership. 
Look, folks, the Senate took up a 
House-led phase 2 package that many 
of us considered not perfect. Phase 2, 
now, let’s keep that in mind. There are 
many phases going on during this pan-
demic. Phase 2, we didn’t feel that was 
perfect. Well, what happens when a 
phase 2 is not perfect? You move to a 
phase 3 because we need relief. We put 
our differences aside here in the Sen-
ate, and we supported—we supported 
the phase 2 package and provided the 
second round of immediate relief for 
our workers, our families, our seniors, 
and our businesses across the country. 
Why? Folks, gosh, darn it, it is the 
right thing to do. Why can’t my Demo-
cratic colleagues do the same? 
We need to be working in the most 
efficient and effective way possible to 
get immediate relief to the men, the 
women, and the children across this 
country. We need to give them what 
they need. 
I have spoken directly with Iowans 
by 
phone 
all 
week: 
the 
small 
businessowners, the members of our ag 
community, many workers at our hos-
pitals and in our healthcare industry, 
these moms and dads, the employees 
and employers, the grandmas and the 
grandpas, nurses and doctors, small 
businessowners, farmers, and veterans; 
you name it. They are all in crisis at 
this very moment. I can’t tell you how 
many of those Iowans were crying on 
the phone with me. They keep saying: 
We need it now. We need relief now. 
Maybe you don’t think, across the 
aisle, that phase 3 is perfect, but—you 
know what—the longer we delay this, 
the more Iowans I am going to hear 
crying on the other end of the phone. 
Not one of them has told me: Don’t 
pass this bill. Not a single one of them. 
What they have said is it needs to be 
done today. 
Again, I will remind you that there 
are States where we have mobilized Na-
tional Guard soldiers. The President 
and those Governors don’t just mobi-
lize National Guard soldiers because it 
is a fun thing to do. They do it because 
we are a nation in crisis. 
Just overnight in Iowa, we had 15 
more cases, and that is a total of 105 
cases of coronavirus in my home State. 
That is not a lot compared to other 
States, but—you know what—Iowa is 
not populated a lot like other States. 
In Iowa, 105 is a lot. 
Just a couple hours ago, I was on a 
call with Iowa’s State leaders who were 
at the State Emergency Operations 
Center. Let me say that again—Emer-
gency Operations Center, an EOC. You 
don’t just set those up for fun, folks. 
You set them up when your State is in 
crisis. 
They gave us a picture of what is 
going on with our workers and our 
small businesses on the ground in Iowa. 
Within 3 hours, the State received over 
11,000 calls for unemployment insur-
ance, and 2,000 of them are self-em-
ployed. They will not qualify for unem-
ployment insurance. You know what 
would relieve their hurt? This package, 
phase 3. 
Meanwhile, 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues are holding this bill up that 
would actually deliver the relief that is 
necessary for these workers whom I 
just mentioned for things that have 
nothing to do with a crisis. Senate 
Democrats are stalling funding for hos-
pitals and small businesses until they 
get to jam through their Green New 
Deal. You tell me: What does placing 
emissions standards on airlines have to 
do with getting Iowa families and 
workers the relief they need right now? 
The Green New Deal was brought up 
on this very floor last year. How many 
of them voted for it? None. None. Big 
zero. Big zero. They didn’t believe in it 
then, so why are they trying to jam it 
through now? 
Americans from every corner of this 
Nation are looking to the Senate for 
more help. This is an extraordinary sit-
uation, folks, and it requires an ex-
traordinary response. This is, arguably, 
the biggest bill ever—nearly $2 trillion 
of funding. But is that enough? If we 
were offering up $3 trillion, would it be 
enough? If it were $4 trillion, would it 
be enough? 
I guarantee you that our friends on 
the other side of the aisle would say: 
Oh, that is not enough. We need the 
Green New Deal. We need XYZ—which 
has nothing to do with the COVID–19 
crisis. 
We are better than this. Let’s come 
together in a bipartisan way, as we 
have done through much of this proc-
ess. We took up phase 2. We supported 
it. I was glad to support it because it 
was the right thing to do. Let’s deliver 
for the American people. It is our duty. 
We do not have time to delay. We must 
pass this additional relief now. 
Again, it is phase 3. There may be 
many more phases to go. And if the 
Democrats believe it is the right thing 
to do, they will get this package done 
today, and we will move on and have 
discussions for yet another phase. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
America is in crisis. Time is of the es-
sence, and the Senate needs to work on 
a bipartisan basis to get the job done 
and get it done today, without delay. 
We see our fellow Americans all 
across this country uniting at this 
time 
of 
crisis—neighbors 
helping 
neighbors, people helping throughout 
their communities. We are watching 
our 
healthcare 
workers 
on 
the 
frontlines of fighting this virus, true 
heroes who are putting themselves at 
risk every day in order to help patients 
coming in the door. 
They are facing extreme shortages in 
personal 
protective 
equipment. 
We 
need to rush that out in much greater 
volumes to protect them. We still have 
a huge shortage of tests in this country 
and got caught way behind the curve, 
and we are having to catch up. We are 
trying to manufacture ventilators to 
help those who are sick and those who 
may get sick. 
In doing that, Americans are coming 
together. We have seen stories of no-
tices going out to dentists’ offices and 
others who have important personal 
protective equipment like masks but 
aren’t needing them right now, to try 
to rush those to local hospitals. 
We have seen nurses and doctors and 
other healthcare workers on the front-
line coming together, and that is ex-
actly what this Senate and House need 
to do. We need to do what Americans 
around the country are doing, uniting 
to help one another and help our coun-
try. 
We did that on rounds 1 and 2. We 
worked very quickly to put together an 
$8.3 billion package for round 1. What 
did that include? More resources for 
our public health infrastructure, more 
resources to try to accelerate the de-
velopment of a vaccine and thera-
peutics. That was all good work. 
On round 2, what did we do? We said 
we want to make sure that tests for the 
coronavirus are free because we don’t 
want Americans not going to get tests 
because they can’t afford them. We had 
to fight for that on the Democratic

March 23, 2020 
side, but it became bipartisan in the 
end. We worked to provide more paid 
sick leave because we don’t think it is 
a good idea for workers who are living 
paycheck to paycheck to feel like they 
have got to go to work when they are 
sick even if it means they are going to 
potentially spread the virus. We want 
to make sure that they can pay the 
bills at home and stay home and not 
spread the virus. 
The provision in round 2 regarding 
paid sick leave was good. There are 
still big gaps in it. So how did rounds 
1 and 2 come to pass? I hear talk over 
here that this is all a House initiative. 
Actually, it was a bipartisan initiative. 
The White House sat down with Speak-
er PELOSI, Secretary Mnuchin with 
Speaker PELOSI, and they hammered 
out rounds 1 and 2 in a bipartisan fash-
ion. They came to the U.S. Senate, and 
they were passed with big bipartisan 
votes. 
We need that same bipartisan spirit 
now. I have been listening in to some of 
the conversation on the floor. First of 
all, I keep hearing there aren’t Demo-
crats on the floor. Well, we are coming. 
The other thing I keep hearing is 
let’s blame Speaker PELOSI. I mean, 
this is pretty amazing. This bill is in 
the U.S. Senate. We are having discus-
sions right now, Democrats and Repub-
licans. We are having discussions right 
now, Democratic Senators and Repub-
lican Senators and the White House— 
again, 
primarily 
with 
Secretary 
Mnuchin—yet I am listening to people 
on the floor blaming Speaker PELOSI. 
Well, guess how rounds 1 and 2 actu-
ally happened? They happened because 
Speaker PELOSI
sat down with the 
Trump administration and they ham-
mered it out on a bipartisan basis and 
came over here. This time—this time— 
the majority leader, Senator MCCON-
NELL, wanted to start the process in 
the Senate. So let’s get it done. Don’t 
go pointing fingers at Speaker PELOSI. 
She is not here. 
I keep hearing about the House want-
ing a Green New Deal as part of this 
emergency package. That is a total red 
herring. I even looked at the list of 
ideas that the House put out, including 
Speaker PELOSI’s. There is no Green 
New Deal on this thing. 
So let’s get real. So why can’t we 
vote today, again, except for by unani-
mous consent? It is not because of the 
Democrats’ vote. It is because the lead-
er, the Republican leader, chose to 
bring up that vote. That was a motion 
to proceed to the cloture vote. It was a 
cloture vote—a motion to proceed to 
cloture on the motion to proceed. That 
is what it was. 
So what did the leader know? He 
knew that we are still engaged in nego-
tiations. They are going on right now. 
Hopefully, when all of us on the floor 
leave here, we will continue to engage. 
But the leader knew that the votes 
were not there for that motion, that 
cloture motion. Yet he burned the one 
opportunity he would have today on 
that vote, knowing it wouldn’t succeed. 
He could have waited 1 hour. He 
could have waited 2 hours. He could 
have waited 3 hours. He chose to hold 
that vote knowing it would fail. That 
is a self-inflicted wound on the U.S. 
Senate and on the American people at 
this moment. 
Because of that decision, we will 
have the earliest opportunity to vote 
again on Wednesday. That was the de-
cision Leader MCCONNELL made when 
he decided to hold that vote today, 
knowing he did not have 60 votes, 
knowing that the negotiations were 
going on right now. 
So he is right. If we want to have a 
vote between now and Wednesday, we 
have to do it by unanimous consent. I 
hope we get to that point, but—make 
no mistake—the vote that was held 
earlier could have waited until later 
today. It could have waited until we 
got closer to an agreement. 
And here is the tragedy of it. We are 
getting pretty close on a lot of impor-
tant issues. We are still far away on 
some, but we are getting close on some 
very important issues: unemployment 
insurance. As we speak, people are los-
ing their jobs. We know that. Small 
businesses are shutting their doors. 
They started days ago having to shut 
their doors in the case of restaurants 
and bars and many other establish-
ments. 
We need to attack that from two an-
gles. One is the unemployment insur-
ance system, and we have made great 
progress in these discussions on that. 
What do we have to do when it comes 
to unemployment insurance? Well, we 
should work to make sure that some-
body who is losing their job through no 
fault of their own because of the 
coronavirus—because they are working 
for an establishment like a restaurant 
that has to shut its doors—has 100 per-
cent wage replacement for the period 
of time of this emergency. We wanted 6 
months. Republicans wanted 3 months. 
I think we have got right now, in the 
draft, 4 months. OK. That is a com-
promise. 
We also wanted to make sure UI 
could cover people who are not part of 
the traditional UI system: part-time 
workers, 
the 
self-employed, 
inde-
pendent contractors, gig workers. So 
we have worked together on a bipar-
tisan basis to make sure that we try to 
get those people help through UI as 
well, even though they are not part of 
the traditional system. We are trying 
to streamline the process by which 
they can demonstrate that they have 
been making an income so that they 
can get help through UI in this emer-
gency moment. 
We are pretty close on that. We have 
worked together on small and even 
midsized businesses because they are 
getting hammered right now across the 
country. We are all hearing from them, 
and they have had to let off their em-
ployees, in many cases, under very 
painful 
circumstances. 
They 
don’t 
want to let their employees go, but no 
customers in the door means no sales, 
means no income. You still have to pay 
your rent, if you are a small business, 
or your mortgage. You have other fixed 
costs. 
So we have come together to work to 
try to provide a small business plan 
that would provide funds to those 
small businesses so that they can keep 
people on their payroll and, if they 
have already had to let them go, rehire 
them and also meet their fixed costs. 
And if they spend the money the way 
it is directed—meaning for necessary, 
fixed costs and for employees—then, at 
the end of the day, that loan can be 
forgiven because we don’t want small 
businesses to have to go through 3 
months with no money through the 
door and just have a huge pile of bills 
they can’t repay at the end of the day. 
We have also tried to expand that to 
include midsized businesses. 
We are making progress on impor-
tant things. Those conversations are 
going on as we speak, but there are 
some areas where we need to reach 
final agreement. One of them is proper 
oversight and safeguards on the $500 
billion fund to help some of the biggest 
businesses in the country. 
We need to make sure we don’t allow 
this economy to go into free fall, but I 
hope we would all agree that we don’t 
want a major corporation getting tax-
payer dollars and going and doing an-
other stock buyback or for big em-
ployee compensation. There is some 
language in there, but then there are 
waiver provisions. 
I hope we would at least put the safe-
guards in this provision that we did in 
TARP, which was the rescue package 
in 2008. That was much maligned. For 
many good reasons, there were not ade-
quate protections to make sure that 
moneys were spent in an accountable 
way. 
Don’t we want to make sure the $500 
billion is spent in an accountable way? 
I don’t know why it is taking us so 
long to come to an agreement on that. 
I don’t think our Republican colleagues 
would want to give any administration 
a blank check to spend $500 billion 
however they want, without any clear 
safeguards or some process for account-
ability. 
That is what we are talking about 
now. Maybe we could resolve that in 2 
hours; maybe we could resolve it in 3. 
Then we could have had the vote. But 
the majority leader burned that vote. 
He burned that vote by having it when 
he knew the votes weren’t there and 
when he knew conversations were still 
going on. 
I was in my office listening to this 
discussion on the floor of the Senate 
with the majority leader all upset. He 
brought that on this body by holding 
that vote as negotiations were going 
on. 
What else do we need to work on 
still? We all got a letter from the Na-
tional Governors Association, bipar-
tisan—Republicans 
and 
Democrats— 
saying: Hey, we are the States; we are 
on the frontlines of this; we need some 
help.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1942 
March 23, 2020 
I don’t know if all my colleagues on 
the floor know it, but just about 48 
hours ago, the position of the Repub-
lican Senate leadership was: No, we are 
not going to deal with those big issues 
now. We will do it another day. 
Those are issues pressing right now. 
We are hearing that from Republican 
and Democratic Governors. We are 
hearing it from mayors. We heard it 
from the National League of Cities. 
Don’t you think it is worth spending a 
couple of hours so that we can hash all 
that out before you call a vote where 
you know the outcome in advance? 
FMAP—these are Republican and 
Democratic Governors pointing out 
they need more Federal help on the 
healthcare and medical front as more 
and more people are coming in the 
doors. Don’t you think we can work 
that out in the next couple of hours? 
Why hold a vote that you know is 
going to fail and means you can’t hold 
the next one until Wednesday without 
unanimous consent? I hope my Repub-
lican colleagues will ask the majority 
leader that question. 
We have made a lot of progress on 
some very important parts of this bill, 
but we also have a fair distance to go. 
But a fair distance in terms of getting 
to an agreement doesn’t mean it has to 
take all day. We should be able to come 
to an agreement on many of these 
things. 
The administration took an appro-
priate action, saying that they don’t 
want landlords to be able to foreclosure 
on certain mortgages. I think we 
should all work together to make sure 
that people don’t get thrown out of 
their homes through foreclosures—or 
evicted from their homes if they are 
renters—during this period of time if it 
turns out they don’t have the income 
to pay those bills. I hope we can work 
that out too. I hope there will be agree-
ment on that measure. 
Instead of playing political games on 
the floor of the Senate and calling a 
vote where the outcome was predeter-
mined because we are still negotiating 
on a bipartisan basis—instead of doing 
that, let’s get this job done. 
To listen to Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate who are negotiating this here try 
to blame the House of Representatives 
and Speaker PELOSI—come on, that is 
just 
political 
rhetoric. 
The 
House 
passed rounds 1 and 2; they did it on a 
bipartisan basis, speaking with the ad-
ministration and Secretary Mnuchin. 
They did that. It is the Senate right 
now that can’t get its job done. 
Let’s stop playing games—procedural 
games. Let’s hammer this out, as we 
have been trying to do. We have made 
progress. We can close the distance, 
and then if we can get all that done, we 
could actually bring it up by unani-
mous consent anytime. 
Let’s do what the American people 
are doing: Let’s unite at this time of 
crisis; let’s unite for the good of the 
country. We did it on rounds 1 and 2. 
Let’s do it to help save our economy 
and fight the healthcare fight against 
the coronavirus. I am confident—I am 
confident—if we put our minds to it, we 
can get the job done for the American 
people. 
Let’s go back to work. Let’s com-
plete these negotiations, and maybe we 
can come back in a couple of hours 
with a proposal that gets the consent 
and support of this entire body. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, the 
health and livelihoods of the American 
people are at risk; they are in danger. 
We cannot afford to keep squabbling 
and arguing in the U.S. Senate. Time is 
not on our side. Each day matters. In 
fact, every hour matters. 
As we look at the stats coming in 
terms of those who have been infected 
with COVID–19, it is literally hour by 
hour. This is a logarithmic kind of 
scale. This is a doubling-every-day 
kind of scale that is going on. Hours 
matter; minutes matter. 
Like many of my colleagues in the 
U.S. Senate, I have been talking to 
Montanans around the clock to get 
their feedback—hospital leaders, ag 
groups, Tribal leaders, small business 
leaders, construction workers. 
We are in a public health and an eco-
nomic crisis. I have not sensed fear like 
this from the American people anytime 
in my life. I remember 9/11. I remember 
the crisis of 2008. I remember the 1987 
crash. Those pale in comparison to 
what we are seeing today at this very 
moment in our country. 
This is a time that we need to come 
together. This is a time we must get 
this done for the good of our country. 
Neither side is going to be happy with 
the final product. That is part of nego-
tiations. It is give, and it is get. The 
Senate bill before us provides relief for 
workers, for families, for small busi-
nesses, 
and 
for 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals. 
I have heard some things said today 
on the U.S. Senate that are flatout not 
true. Let me set some of the facts 
straight—what this bill before us does 
do. It provides $250 billion of unemploy-
ment insurance for those who have lost 
their jobs during the coronavirus out-
break—$250 billion. What that means in 
Montana is $600 a week. That is twice 
as big as what is currently paid per 
week. It is $4 billion for masks, for 
gowns, for gloves, ventilators. It is the 
PPE discussion I just had a couple of 
hours ago with some of my hospital 
leaders and doctors and medical lead-
ers across Montana. They are scared. 
There is a shortage of PPE. This bill 
provides $4 billion to CDC to address 
that. I will tell you what: By dinking 
around here over this today, we lost 
another day when we could be moving 
forward to get it in the hands of our 
healthcare professionals. 
It provides $350 billion to allow our 
small businesses survive and rebound. 
We have had some very healthy, pros-
perous, good small businesses employ a 
lot of people in Montana. These are 
good jobs. Now they are not just wor-
ried about liquidity; they are worried 
about insolvency. These are ranchers. 
These are restaurant owners. 
It provides $10.5 billion for drug de-
velopment to treat and prevent the 
virus. Listen, we will not stop the 
panic we see right now in our country 
until we stop the pandemic. We will 
not stop this pandemic until we have 
drugs available for the American peo-
ple that will provide immunity to 
them. 
There is great hope on the horizon. 
There are amazing vaccines. There are 
amazing 
monoclonal 
antibodies 
through incredible ingenuity and inno-
vation that we can provide to the 
American people before the second 
wave hits this fall. 
You talk to the doctors, our best 
leaders at NIH, at the FDA, at the 
CDC; they are telling us there is prob-
ably a second wave pandemic coming 
in the fall of 2020 if we don’t act now 
because, as is true with most of the 
world, we don’t have the immune sys-
tems here to combat this virus—this 
coronavirus—that produces COVID–19. 
You either get the immunity from 
catching the disease or getting a vac-
cine or these other drugs that can pro-
vide the antibodies. 
There is good news on the horizon. 
What did we do in this bill? We are 
going to allow the acceleration of man-
ufacturing so we can get this into a 
widespread distribution for the Amer-
ican people to protect them in the next 
flu season when most scientists believe 
we will probably get hit with this 
again. 
We just lost another day here in the 
U.S. Senate. Every day matters. We 
have vaccine trials going on, as we 
speak, in Seattle. They started on 
Monday. There are 45 individuals who 
received a vaccine that we believe can 
protect you from the coronavirus. Can 
you imagine the good news for the 
American people if we found out we 
have a vaccine that will protect us; we 
have a drug that will protect us; we 
have therapeutics that will help us if 
we contract the coronavirus. We just 
lost another day that could be a day we 
could have been closer to getting that 
into the hands of the American people. 
We are in a race for time. We are now 
into the end of March. We have to get 
this available by September to the 
American people. This is literally an 
all-of-government, Manhattan Project 
kind of approach. And we just lost an-
other day here because we couldn’t get 
this passed in the U.S. Senate. 
This also provides $75 billion for our 
hospitals and our healthcare providers. 
Those are the men and women on the 
frontlines right now, saving lives. God 
bless them—$75 billion for them. 
If you heard the Democrats talk 
about this bill, you would think there 
is nothing here for the average, hard- 
working person in this country. That is 
absolutely false, and we can lay it all 
out. 
There are parts of the bill that I 
don’t like. There are parts of this bill

that I would change. But we have to be 
satisfied now with a good 80 for 20 be-
cause speed matters. It matters to get 
something done. The American people 
are looking here. The dysfunction in 
Washington they don’t understand. 
Frankly, I don’t either. 
This bill before us was written by Re-
publicans and Democrats. I will tell 
you why I know that—because I was 
part of helping negotiate to get $10 bil-
lion for this acceleration of vaccines 
and drug program. I went in this week-
end. 
We 
were 
sitting, 
looking 
at 
spreadsheets that said here is the Re-
publican ask; here is the Democrat ask. 
There are spreadsheets. We can show 
them to you. We were going back and 
forth in a bipartisan way to try to craft 
a bill that we could pass in the Senate 
last night. 
In fact, the American people are 
watching, both sides, in this ping pong 
match where one side says one thing, 
and the other side says the other. 
Sometimes I look to people like 
SUSAN COLLINS and LAMAR ALEXANDER 
at moments like this. I think few 
Americans, few Senators, would claim 
that 
either 
LAMAR
or 
SUSAN
are 
hyperpartisan Senators. They have a 
pretty good temperature of the Senate. 
They have a good sense of finding ways 
to make things work. When you hear 
Senator SUSAN
COLLINS
outraged at 
what happened when Senator SCHUMER 
and Speaker PELOSI basically put the 
brakes on the discussions, we lost an-
other day—maybe two—by demanding 
that this bill include an ideological 
wish list. SUSAN COLLINS is outraged. 
LAMAR ALEXANDER was shocked. 
Let me tell you something: When 
SUSAN COLLINS is outraged and LAMAR 
ALEXANDER is shocked about what is 
going on around here, that tells you 
something. You can discount what I 
am saying here—and many Republican 
Senators and Democratic Senators— 
but those two Senators are viewed as 
some of the most bipartisan Senators 
here, and when they are outraged and 
shocked, that tells you what is going 
on in terms of one of the low levels of 
partisanship we have achieved in the 
U.S. Senate over the course of the last 
couple of days. This obstruction will 
create a devastating impact on Amer-
ican workers, on families, and small 
businesses. They are pushing for things 
that have nothing to do with the public 
health and economic crisis we are fac-
ing today. The issues they are pushing 
have nothing to do with overcoming 
this pandemic. 
In a global pandemic, some have 
tossed aside bipartisanship to push for 
airline emissions standards. 
I was told there is no such thing as a 
House bill. That is false. Here is NANCY 
PELOSI’s House bill. She is part of the 
discussions. Why? Because we need 
something that can pass the Senate 
quickly now and then go to the House 
even more quickly. 
Let me tell the American people 
something else. The House is not here 
this week. I was just speaking with a 
Montanan on the phone off the floor of 
the Senate a few minutes ago. I was de-
scribing what is going on. He was de-
spondent, by the way, fearing both the 
pandemic and also the economic panic 
because he is losing his business. 
I said: Do you realize the U.S. House 
is not even in town right now? 
He said: I didn’t know that. 
They are not. They left town last 
week. They are not here. At a moment 
when the country needs us, the House 
left town. They are not here as we 
speak. I think that has been lost in the 
discussion. 
We can debate some of their ideolog-
ical requests another time down the 
road. I mean, here is one from Pelosi’s 
bill: the full offset of domestic airline 
emissions by 2025 for airlines that need 
assistance. This is section 1 of the 
Pelosi bill. It is right here. We can 
have a debate another time whether 
they should have part of this New 
Green Deal to offset emissions. Now is 
not the time for that debate. Now is 
the time to save the American people 
both 
economically 
and 
with 
their 
health. 
We 
need 
to 
get 
our 
priorities 
straight. 
That 
means 
putting 
the 
American people first. This is not a 
stimulus package. That is the wrong 
name for it. This is not a recovery 
package. That is the wrong name for it. 
This is a rescue package. What we are 
debating right now is a rescue package. 
We must come together on both sides. 
The coronavirus is not partisan. It 
crosses party lines. It crosses country 
boundaries. This is a global challenge 
on the shores of our country. It was 
time for both sides to come together 
and vote this bill out of the Senate yes-
terday, but that didn’t happen. The 
next best time is today. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides to 
set aside the perfect and move forward 
with this to restore the confidence of 
the American people for their health 
and their economic well-being. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the 
United States is in the middle of a 
global pandemic, probably the worst 
public health crisis in over 100 years 
this country has faced. Every minute 
matters, every hour, every day. I have 
been saying this for 2 months now. Yet 
where are the Democrats? There is not 
a single one of them down here right 
now. Where have they been all after-
noon? There was maybe one, two, or 
three. Probably every Republican over 
here has spoken because twice in less 
than 24 hours, the Democrats have re-
fused to even start debate on legisla-
tion that would help the American peo-
ple and our economy survive this cri-
sis; that would provide over $3,000 to 
your average working family in just 
the coming weeks; that would provide 
extra unemployment benefits to the 
millions of Americans who already lost 
their jobs and regrettably are going to 
lose their jobs; that would provide 
loans to our small- and medium-size 
businesses so they won’t have to lay off 
those Americans as they struggle to 
pay the bills; that would help indus-
tries that have been devastated, like 
the hotel industry. Thousands and 
thousands of hard-working Americans 
clean the rooms, make the beds, cook 
the food—all of whom desperately need 
help. The Democrats won’t even start 
debate on that legislation. That is 
what they have done twice. They have 
not voted to defeat any legislation; 
they have voted to not even start de-
bate. 
In fact, earlier today, SUSAN COL-
LINS—probably the kindest, most de-
cent, most bipartisan Senator—took 
the floor to speak, and CHUCK SCHUMER 
blocked her. He refused to allow her to 
speak, probably because he was scared 
of what she had to say and probably, 
just like there are no Democrats here 
right now, because they know they 
don’t have anything to say. They have 
no case to make. 
Earlier today, SHERROD BROWN was 
accusing us of not acting quickly 
enough on NANCY PELOSI’s legislation 
that the House passed, popped smoke, 
and left town for more than a week. I 
asked a simple question: When did the 
House bill arrived in the Senate? He re-
fused to answer. I asked him again that 
simple question. He refused to answer 
and rather engaged in ad hominem at-
tacks, which is his weak and sad way of 
saying he has no answer, which is so 
often the case with the Senator from 
Ohio. 
They come down here and they at-
tack the Republicans for wanting cor-
porate bailouts. They say we want to 
bail out corporations. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Any large com-
pany that borrows money from the 
Treasury or takes advantage of Federal 
Reserve programs will have onerous 
terms attached to it and will have lots 
of strings as well. We insisted that only 
loans be available, not grants, not cash 
handouts. 
Do you know what the Democrats are 
advocating for behind closed doors? Be-
hind closed doors, the Democrats are 
demanding free cash handouts for the 
airlines. Right through that door right 
there is CHUCK SCHUMER’s office. They 
are demanding free cash giveaways for 
major corporations, and they have the 
nerve to come down here and accuse us 
of bailouts? Go right through that door 
and ask CHUCK SCHUMER what he is de-
manding in secret behind closed doors. 
Don’t forget about all of their cities 
and all their States. DICK DURBIN rep-
resents one of the most bankrupt 
States in America and the most bank-
rupt city in America—Chicago. Behind 
those closed doors, they are demanding 
straight cash bailouts for States and 
cities that have been fiscally irrespon-
sible for years. Yet they come down 
here and accuse us of bailouts. We are 
willing to help these cities and States. 
They are overwhelmed by this pan-
demic. Yet we simply say they have to 
repay the money on the back end. That 
is not what the Democrats are asking

for behind those closed doors over 
there. They want straight cash pay-
ments. 
You ask yourself, why would they 
not even start debate? Remember, that 
is all we have been talking about here 
over these last 18 hours. Why would 
they risk your life and your loved ones’ 
lives and your job and your lifetime of 
retirement savings? Now we know. 
NANCY PELOSI is circulating a 1,400- 
page bill that she wants Congress to 
pass that she claims will help save this 
Nation from this terrible crisis. It is 
1,400 pages. It is almost three times 
longer than our legislation, by the 
way. 
To give you a sense of what might be 
in that bill, because, let me tell you, 
she is not hiding the good stuff in her 
bill—I don’t have 1,400 pages here, but 
I have a few pages. Let’s just go 
through what is a priority for NANCY 
PELOSI and the Democrats as they dith-
er while Americans die. 
Corporate 
board 
diversity. 
The 
Democrats want to impose quotas for 
race and sex on corporate boards. I 
know they have wanted to do that for 
a long time. Is that going to stop any-
one 
from 
getting 
sick 
from 
the 
coronavirus? 
Here is another one: bailing out the 
Postal Service, wiping all the debts 
that the post office has towards the 
Treasury. That is another issue we 
have been debating for a long time. The 
Postal Service needs relief. I greatly 
respect and praise the hard work of the 
men and women who are still deliv-
ering the mail, but is a survival pack-
age for the coronavirus the right time 
to be talking about Postal Service debt 
to the Treasury? 
Here is another one: a $10,000 min-
imum 
of 
student 
loan 
forgiveness 
across the board. That is another ideo-
logical wish-list item for the Demo-
crats. What does it have to do with 
stopping a pandemic, especially when 
Donald Trump has already waived stu-
dent loan payments for Americans who 
are affected by this terrible pandemic? 
Early voting mandated in every sin-
gle State. That is the same kind of 
early voting that almost doomed the 
Democrats’ favorite Presidential can-
didate, Joe Biden, for whom NANCY 
PELOSI
and CHUCK
SCHUMER
worked 
tirelessly to beat their colleague BER-
NIE SANDERS. 
Combine that with same-day reg-
istration. Every single State has to 
register voters on the same day. Now 
they want to pile election rules on a 
bill that is designed to stop a pan-
demic. Let me remind you, these elec-
tion rules were written by the same 
partisan geniuses who couldn’t even 
count their own votes in the Iowa 
Democratic caucuses. 
Here is a good one too: airline carbon 
emission offsets. Every airline that 
benefits from these programs—which is 
probably going to be all of them—has 
to go carbon neutral by 2025. Gee, it is 
going to be a pretty amazing feat of en-
gineering to get jet engines you can 
plug into the wall and fly across the 
continent. Democrats have a lot of 
faith in American ingenuity. I wonder 
if that will apply, by the way, to the 
private planes that NANCY PELOSI and 
her family fly in or all their buddies in 
Hollywood. 
What about this one: Every airline 
has to tell you on every single flight 
what the greenhouse gas emissions of 
that flight are. You get your departure 
time and your seat number and your 
gate number and, oh, by the way, how 
many greenhouse gas emissions your 
plane will have. What will that do to 
help a vitally important and dev-
astated industry get back on its feet? 
Subsidizing 
retirement 
plans 
for 
community 
newspaper 
employees. 
Look, this has been a longstanding de-
bate in Congress. It almost sank the re-
tirement reform bill last year, and here 
it is again in a bill designed to stop a 
pandemic. Are you kidding me? 
There is a $15-an-hour minimum 
wage. Unfortunately, millions of Amer-
icans are learning that the true min-
imum wage is zero when you lose your 
job because of a global pandemic that 
is killing your fellow citizens and our 
elected leaders won’t even have a de-
bate on the bill. 
Here is a beauty too: mandating that 
Federal public employee unions get 
paid for the union work they do. That 
means you, as a taxpayer, will pay Fed-
eral bureaucrats when they are doing 
work not for you, the taxpayer, but for 
their unions. Again, is that going to 
stop the pandemic? 
I could go on and on and on. The 
Democrats’ bill is 1,400 pages, after all. 
But the point is this: There is a good 
bill that was negotiated in good faith 
over the weekend with many Demo-
crats—no matter what they say—that 
they are now blocking, that they will 
not even start debate on because of ide-
ological wish-list items like those. It is 
disgraceful and it is dangerous to the 
lives of our people and to their eco-
nomic well-being. It is time for the 
Democrats to get serious and to do 
their job. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, 
may I just add to what Mr. COTTON 
from Arkansas just said. It is dan-
gerous. I think it is disgraceful. It is ir-
responsible, and it is not going to 
work. We are not going to do this. 
I think people on our side are willing 
to go big. For Republicans, it is not so 
easy in 1 day to spend all we are going 
to spend in a single year. We are going 
to spend in 1 day about $1.8 trillion— 
probably closer to $2 trillion when it is 
over with. That is as much as we would 
spend in an entire year for discre-
tionary spending. That is big. I would 
like to go smart. If you are going to go 
big, you need to be smart, right? You 
don’t need to go crazy. 
The only reason we are not voting on 
this bill is because the House hijacked 
this process. NANCY
PELOSI
tried to 
control impeachment. She tried to set 
the terms of the debate for the U.S. 
Senate in the impeachment trial before 
she would send over the impeachment 
articles. Do you remember that whole 
debacle? And as we were dealing with 
this impeachment garbage, China was 
on fire. You will hear more about that 
later in the year. 
I guess what I would say is that we 
need to get on with it. You are not 
going to be successful. We are not 
going to let this happen to the Amer-
ican people. 
Rahm Emanuel, whom I actually 
like, said: For every crisis is an oppor-
tunity. This is not your opportunity to 
impose same-day voting. In the House 
bill, they are requiring every State in 
the Union, whether you like it or not, 
to allow same-day registration and vot-
ing. I personally would like to do that 
in South Carolina but not to combat 
the coronavirus. That is a dream they 
have. This is not the time to enact that 
dream. 
If you are on a ventilator or if you 
are a nurse at a hospital and are wait-
ing on medical supplies, please tell 
them you can’t get your stuff until the 
Republicans agree to same-day voting. 
They are literally holding hostage the 
relief for doctors and nurses, for towns 
and cities, and for businesses that have 
had to lay off their workers for same- 
day voting, for corporate diversity, for 
$15-an-hour minimum wage. If you get 
a dime of money in your business under 
the House bill, you will have to pay 
your employees $15 an hour. 
Literally, they are using this sad day 
in America to enact policies that 
wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in 
hell of getting through the U.S. Sen-
ate. They see this as a moment for 
them. We see this as a moment for you. 
They see this as an opportunity to do 
things they couldn’t do without the 
country’s being on fire. 
To my Democratic colleagues, I will 
work with you to make sure that the 
money going to American corporations 
goes to the right people. All of us don’t 
want stock buybacks. All of us want to 
make sure that the money is lent and 
not given as a grant to the big compa-
nies in this country. All of us are will-
ing to do more to help the States. We 
are willing to work on the problem. We 
are willing to take your legislative 
wish list and allow you to use this mo-
ment of crisis to turn the country up-
side down. 
I don’t know why you want to do 
this, but I know this: If we were doing 
this, the media would be eating us 
alive. If there were a House bill that 
the Republicans were writing that did 
away with the right to unionization, 
every major paper and TV station in 
this country would be talking about 
how the Republican Party is going nuts 
in its trying to take an ideological 
agenda and attach it to a national cri-
sis that we haven’t seen since World 
War II. 
So two things are going to happen. 
We are not going to give in, because it 
is wrong. It corrupts everything about

why we are here. We worked with the 
House-passed bill that we didn’t like 
because we needed to get something 
done that was relevant to the problem. 
To the Speaker of the House, you see 
this as an opportunity to do things you 
couldn’t do otherwise. The Republicans 
see this as an opportunity to do things 
that have to be done now in order to 
save lives. 
I have never been more disgusted 
since Kavanaugh. You tried to destroy 
a good man’s life just to keep the seat 
open. Close friends of mine in the 
House have publicly said that this is an 
opportunity to reshape the country in 
‘‘our image.’’ It is not going to happen. 
We 
didn’t 
let 
you 
destroy 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s life to keep the seat open, 
and we are not going to let you turn 
the country upside down to shape it in 
your image. We will work with you, in 
a very generous fashion, to help people 
who have lost their jobs and to help 
doctors and nurses who have run out of 
supplies. 
Shame on you. Shame on you for 
coming in at the eleventh hour and 
taking good faith negotiations and 
throwing them in an ideological ditch. 
To the American people, they are 
going to give in because what they are 
wanting to do should make you as mad 
as hell. If you have a family member 
who is suffering, do you really think 
now is the time to impose same-day 
voting? 
With regard to student loans, a 
$10,000 loan forgiveness for every stu-
dent loan in the country is a debate we 
will have but not on this bill. Let me 
tell you what it would cost to forgive 
$10,000 on every student loan in this 
country—about $500 billion. Here is the 
question: If you are going to spend $500 
billion, wouldn’t you want to spend it 
on the virus? Wouldn’t you want to 
spend it on hospitals that are under 
siege? Wouldn’t you want to spend it 
on businesses that are shut down and 
have no hope of opening up anytime 
soon? 
So we are going to hold our ground to 
focus on the people who need the help 
the most. We are going to say no to an 
ideological agenda. I can’t believe that 
we are having to do this. What the hell 
has happened? How could we get here 
as a nation? We have come a long way 
from ‘‘we are all in it together’’ to this. 
To my colleagues on the other side, I 
am more than willing to work with you 
on unemployment insurance and on all 
of the things that are in this bill. I am 
not going to give in to the hijacking of 
the legislative process by the most par-
tisan people in the country at a time 
when people are dying. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know 
there are a number of Senators here 
who wish to speak. So I will not be 
long. 
It makes me angry that we are here, 
talking about a bill that will not only 
help to defeat this virus but that will 
also put money in the hands of people 
who are wondering: How am I going to 
pay the rent? How am I going to buy 
groceries? How am I going to buy food 
for my children? 
We have our Democratic colleagues, 
who, on a party-line vote, blocked the 
very help for the people I am talking 
about. They are not worried about 
from where their next rent checks are 
coming or how they are going to pay 
their mortgages. They are getting paid. 
They are not worried about ending up 
like hourly workers or people who are 
working for tips, who are scared to 
death about how they are going to 
make ends meet. 
First of all, they are worried about 
getting sick. Secondly, if you work for 
a restaurant or a hotel or are in some 
other service industry—heck, if you 
work for an airline and have been fur-
loughed and are wondering how you are 
going to make ends meet—it should 
make all of us angry that our Demo-
cratic colleagues are using this na-
tional emergency in order to leverage 
their ideological wish list. 
You have heard it talked about here 
many times, but let me just make a 
couple of points. 
In addition to having the money go 
to individuals, there is enhanced unem-
ployment compensation because people 
don’t know how long this is going to 
last, and they will need to be able to 
sustain themselves. There is the assist-
ance to small businesses so they can 
maintain their payrolls, perhaps, and 
keep their businesses alive for the du-
ration of this crisis. People want to 
know how they are going to make ends 
meet today. They want to make sure 
there will be jobs waiting for them 
after we get on the other side of this 
coronavirus. That is what our help for 
the small businesses is designed to do. 
The third part, which really makes 
me angry, is to hear them talk about 
this bill as containing a slush fund for 
Big Business. In my State and in Sen-
ator CRUZ’s State, some of these busi-
nesses employ hundreds of thousands of 
people. I have never understood how 
you can claim to love the workers but 
hate the very person or the business 
that provides them with jobs. You 
can’t separate those two. You need to 
have workers and those who have in-
vested, who have created something, so 
they provide jobs. 
This ideological division is designed 
for no other purpose than to mislead 
people into thinking this is some sort 
of bailout. This isn’t a bailout. What 
we are talking about are businesses 
that, through no fault of their own, are 
going to have to lay off workers and 
try to make sure that, when we get on 
the other side of this virus—when we 
beat this virus—there will be jobs still 
available so our economy can come 
roaring back, as it will do, unless we 
mishandle our work here. So I am 
angry, and I am frustrated. I am not 
the only one. 
I think about the mom and dad who 
are thinking: Hey, I work at a res-
taurant. The government shut the res-
taurant down. I don’t have a paycheck. 
How am I going to provide for my fam-
ily? 
It is our Democratic colleagues, by 
their complete and unequivocal devo-
tion to their ideological agenda, who 
are basically turning their backs on 
them, our fellow citizens. This is not a 
time for us to engage in partisan divi-
sion. This is a time for us to give help 
where help is needed as soon as we pos-
sibly can. 
As I said, I know the other Senators 
wish to speak. So I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
have been here a little over a year and 
have dealt with several issues that tell 
me how this place works. I never 
thought we would come to the point at 
which we have actually choked down 
the real economy with the valid effort 
of trying to get rid of a disease, and the 
American public—caught in the cross-
fire—is already suffering. The ones who 
had to shutter their businesses early 
were hoping that, when they woke up 
today, they were going to see some-
thing. You can see that it is not going 
to happen. 
Many others here have kind of gone 
after the other side, and I think that it 
is a valid argument. Yet what I am 
going to talk about here this evening 
are two things. If we do not get some-
thing done through unanimous consent 
and have to wait until Wednesday, we 
will all be held accountable, and we 
will have done what this place nor-
mally does—it doesn’t work for the 
people who sent us here to do the busi-
ness. 
A hotel owner in Indianapolis called 
me earlier in the week. Last week, he 
had 2-percent occupancy. A number of 
small businesses across the country, 
not only in Indiana, have had employ-
ees leave, and they have had to shutter 
their businesses by government edict. 
The toll and the carnage is going to be 
great. 
I want to stress what we might get 
done. I had four or five Democratic 
Senators tell me this, and I want to 
throw the gauntlet out and do it pub-
licly. Obviously, a list like this does 
not make sense, and how you would 
even bring that up at a time like this 
boggles my mind. Four or five different 
Democratic Senators said that, if we 
would come together on three areas, 
they would have enough people to get 
it across the finish line even through 
unanimous consent. 
No. 1—and I think most of the folks 
on my side of the aisle would agree—is 
shoring up what State and local gov-
ernments need to effectively handle 
this crisis. That is Main Street. That 
sounds OK with me. 
Next is helping the frontline industry 
that is responsible for fighting the dis-
ease—hospitals and providers. We are 
really close. We are not far away. 
The one that we hear the most about 
would be the transparency associated

with what could be the most important 
part of the package. It is the Emer-
gency Stabilization Fund, which would 
help all of those businesses that need 
liquidity in order to keep employees on 
their payrolls. I am going to be for full 
transparency. As for the airlines and 
their practices and what they did at 
the time that ate up all of their cash, 
I think there needs to be account-
ability. 
Senator MANCHIN said earlier that it 
needs stronger language to prohibit 
stock buybacks—check. Most of us 
would be for that. Secretary Mnuchin 
could not have full latitude on where 
to direct the funds. I am a Main Street 
guy. I would go for that too. 
We don’t have enough restraints on 
the assistance in firing employees at a 
later time, as employers might do. Any 
of us who care about our employees 
would be for that as well. There are a 
couple other things. 
So I throw the gauntlet out to the 
leadership, who I think trotted out a 
lot of this other stuff, confused the 
process, and now we are here to where 
we have to do it with unanimous con-
sent. 
I feel good that our side comes along 
on three key areas: helping State and 
local governments, helping the front-
line of defense, hospitals, and holding 
the big companies accountable that are 
going to get the benefit of government 
assistance. And we need to keep in 
mind: This isn’t 2008, where you are 
looking at bailing out and helping 
some of the people who caused the 
problem. 
Even these larger businesses have 
been impacted by government edict to 
flatten the curve, and what we have to 
make sure is that we get this out the 
door so that, in the process of flat-
tening the curve, we do not flatten the 
economy. We owe it to every wage 
earner, to every small business, and to 
Americans in general. 
Let’s take those three areas that 
many Democrats told me today if we 
just get them freed up, we will get it 
across the finish line. That is the 
gauntlet I throw at the leadership on 
the other side. Let’s get it done. The 
American public expects us to. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this is a 
time of extraordinary crisis for our Na-
tion. 
In this time of crisis, I call upon each 
of our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to rise above—rise above paid par-
tisanship, rise above the bickering that 
so often consumes Washington, rise 
above and put first the priorities of the 
millions of Americans who are hurt. 
Look, there is a time for political 
disagreements. There is a time for pol-
icy disagreements. I am no stranger to 
robust political and policy disagree-
ments. But we are in this midst of a 
global pandemic. People are dying. 
People are suffering. 
Last night, when this Senate voted 
on whether to move forward with emer-
gency relief legislation for the millions 
of people being devastated by the eco-
nomic disaster we are seeing as a result 
of the coronavirus epidemic, every sin-
gle Democrat in this body voted to 
block consideration of this bill. 
Now, for those of you at home who 
are not poring over a Senate proce-
dural matter, what does it mean to 
vote to block consideration? It doesn’t 
mean they voted against the bill. It 
means they voted against even starting 
to take it up. 
The New York Times headline, mo-
ments 
afterward, 
said: 
Democrats 
block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill. Of 
course, that headline had the fault of 
being accurate, and so within minutes, 
the New York Times changed it to: 
Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus 
bill citing worker concerns. That was 
headline No. 2. 
But then apparently the partisan 
leanings of the New York Times were 
too strong for that, and so they revised 
it a third time to say: Partisan division 
halts discussion of the bill. 
No, it wasn’t partisan division. It was 
one party—the Democratic Party—say-
ing to this Chamber and the American 
people: Hell, no. We will not even take 
this up and discuss it. 
At a time of crisis, at a time when 
people are dying, that is wrong. That is 
shameful. 
When we awakened this morning, fol-
lowing the Democrats’ obstruction, 
worldwide there were 372,563 reported 
cases of the coronavirus. In the hours 
since then, just today, there have been 
an additional 23,352 cases reported 
today. While the Democrats are block-
ing the bill, 23,000 new cases today. 
In the United States, when we start-
ed this morning, there were 35,224 
cases—this morning. Right now, as of 
the latest numbers, there are 41,708 
cases in the United States today. That 
means we have had an additional 6,484 
cases today while the Democrats are 
blockading—and by the way, where are 
the Democrats? 
C–SPAN doesn’t show this whole 
Chamber often, but it would be nice if 
they did because that entire side of the 
Chamber is empty. They are not show-
ing up for work. They are not doing 
their job. 
In Texas this morning, there had 
been 668 cases. As of right now, there 
are 722—54 more cases today while the 
Democrats are blocking consideration 
of this bill. 
How about deaths? Look, as we look 
at this crisis, there are people right 
now gasping for breath. You and I, we 
have friends who have been diagnosed 
with this disease. We have read stories. 
We have talked to people who have 
struggled under it. 
I heard from one individual who is 
hospitalized right now that breathing 
felt like a belt strapped across his 
chest; that he could barely breathe. 
As of this morning, worldwide, there 
had been 16,381 deaths. I am sorry— 
that is the number now. This morning 
it was only 15,308. That means today, 
while the Democrats have been block-
ing this bill, 1,073 additional people 
died. 
In the United States, as of this morn-
ing, there were 471 deaths reported due 
to coronavirus. As of right now, it is 
573. That means today 102 Americans 
died while the Democrats were block-
ing consideration of this bill. 
In Texas as of this morning, there 
had been eight deaths. Now there are 
nine. One Texan died while half this 
Chamber refused to show up and do 
their job. 
Now, this morning when we voted 
again, we saw the first signs of cracks. 
There was one Democrat, a Senator 
from Alabama, who had voted no yes-
terday, decided this morning, well, 
maybe we should take up the bill. One. 
One Democrat. Where are the rest? 
There are a lot of Democrats who 
like to hold themselves out as mod-
erate Democrats. Where are they? 
Right now, what the Democratic 
leadership is doing is they are playing 
games. They are playing games in a 
way that is irresponsible. 
Listen, this bill has a lot of impor-
tant elements for a lot of people who 
are hurting. You have not only the peo-
ple who are hospitalized, the people 
who are suffering, but you also have 
economic devastation, as much of this 
country has ground to a halt. 
We have people who work in res-
taurants, waiters, waitresses, bellboys 
who haven’t gone to work in over a 
week. We have people in hotels. I have 
spoken to business owner after busi-
ness owner after business owner for the 
last week. 
One hotel owner described how he 
currently had 6 percent occupancy 
rates. You can’t keep a hotel running 
with 6 percent occupancy rates. 
I talked to one hotel owner who de-
scribed how he had made 5,000 layoffs 
in the last week. Another hotel owner 
had made 6,000 layoffs in the past week. 
I talked to an oil and gas business 
owner who had laid off 5,000 workers in 
the past week. I talked to another oil 
and gas business owner who had laid off 
5,000 workers in the last week. 
You know, today I am thinking about 
people like my friends, the Republic 
Country Club. Now, Republic Country 
Club is a bit of a misnomer. It is a bar-
becue joint outside of Houston. It is 
owned by my friend Michael Berry. It 
is often the venue of country-western 
concerts. The venue is sometimes for 
comedy shows. 
I went and took my dad to Larry the 
Cable Guy at Republic Country Club. I 
have had multiple election night par-
ties at Republic Country Club. It is a 
big old honky-tonk. You have never 
seen so many confused national report-
ers as they walked in and looked 
around and didn’t know what to make 
of the place. 
Father’s Day a year ago, I did a Fa-
ther’s Day party at Republic Country 
Club. My dad—we roasted up two whole 
pigs. The cook staff at the barbecue 
place, they made them up and had a big

party. We invited people there. It is a 
Cuban tradition to roast a whole pig. 
Now, why am I telling you about Re-
public Country Club? Because yester-
day, which happened to be my father’s 
81st 
birthday—yesterday 
Republic 
Country Club announced they are clos-
ing their doors. 
Yesterday Michael Berry sent out a 
tweet telling first responders, telling 
police officers and firefighters and ev-
eryone on the frontline, he said: Drive 
by Republic Country Club today— 
March 23—drive by during the day, and 
we will give you free barbecue. We are 
going to cook everything we have, and 
we are just going to give it away and to 
go. You can’t come in, but we are going 
to give you to-go boxes. 
And he went on to say they are 
emptying out all of the liquor from the 
storeroom and from behind the bar, 
and they are giving it to the employees 
because the employees are all being 
laid off. And he said he doesn’t know if 
he will open again. 
Now, I will tell you, those employ-
ees—the bartenders, the bouncers— 
many of them are veterans. Many of 
them are big guys, covered with tats. 
They are salt of the earth, and right 
now they don’t know where the rent 
check is coming from next week. 
That is happening all across this 
country. That is happening not just at 
one barbecue place in Houston. That is 
happening at bars. That is happening 
at nail salons. It is happening at movie 
theaters. 
You know, I love Sunday night to go 
with a buddy of mine and go watch a 
movie. Movie theaters are shut down 
all over this country. 
Retail stores—people laid off. Nobody 
is going to the mall right now, and for 
the people who are hurting, they are 
scared. They don’t know, No. 1, if they 
are going to get sick, but No. 2, they 
don’t know how they are going to 
make ends meet. 
This is a time of crisis, and we ought 
to be coming together. 
Now, listen, this bill that we were 
moving to, I don’t necessarily agree 
with every word of it, but there are a 
number of elements in this bill that are 
designed to provide real help to people 
who are hurting. 
One element of this bill is to give 
cash—an immediate check for $1,200— 
to every person in this country, every 
adult in this country earning under 
$75,000 a year, $2,400 for every couple 
earning under $150,000 a year, plus $500 
for every child they have. 
Now, you want to talk about real re-
lief for people who are scared and they 
say: What do I do next? Those are 
checks that are coming in the mail. 
And what have the Democrats said? 
No. Halt the checks. 
Right now, those checks aren’t com-
ing, and they aren’t coming for one 
reason: because the Senate Democrats 
are blocking taking up that bill. 
In many circumstances, that would 
not be the right policy outcome, to just 
send checks to people, but at a time of 
crisis, where you need people just to be 
able to make it to tomorrow, putting 
some resources in their hands makes a 
big difference. 
Another element of this bill that is 
being blocked by Senate Democrats is 
$350 billion in emergency loans to 
small businesses—to small businesses 
like Republic Country Club, to small 
businesses like restaurants and bars, 
and small businesses like nail salons 
and barber shops and movie theaters 
and dress shops and hardware stores, 
small businesses that are right now 
putting up the signs saying: ‘‘Closed 
for coronavirus.’’ 
Those emergency loans are designed 
to be given with the condition that 
they keep their employees on payroll. 
A lot of these small business owners 
want to keep their employees on pay-
roll, but they don’t have the cash. 
Under the terms of this bill, those 
loans are forgiven if—if—if they keep 
their employees on payroll. 
By the way, the Democratic talking 
point is, oh, this is just cash to busi-
nesses. Tell that to the owner of the 
barber shop who takes an emergency 
loan to not fire all of her employees. 
That loan, under the terms, is forgiven 
if the employees stay on the payroll. 
The Democrats are blocking that right 
now. 
What about unemployment insur-
ance? The job numbers coming out 
shortly I expect to be massive in terms 
of the job losses. I think we will see 
north of 2 or 3 million people who lost 
their jobs, and the numbers are getting 
worse. Every phone call I have is with 
more people who are losing their jobs. 
It is bad. It will come back, but it is 
bad right now. We need emergency sup-
port to get people through this dark 
time. 
This bill has $250 billion for addi-
tional unemployment insurance. What 
does that mean? That is an additional 
$600 per week for an additional 13 
weeks. If you are one of the waitresses 
right now who have just been told their 
jobs have gone away and you applied 
for unemployment insurance, if this 
bill passes, you get an extra $600 imme-
diately. But you know what—you don’t 
right now because Senate Democrats 
are blocking this. If they have reason-
able concerns, they are welcome to 
raise them. 
By the way, this bill was drafted with 
the participation of nearly a dozen 
Senate Democrats who were actively 
part of the task force’s submitting sug-
gestions. One of the suggestions the 
Democrats submitted during the draft-
ing was to plus-up those unemploy-
ment insurance numbers, and they got 
agreement. This was drafted in a bipar-
tisan manner. 
What happened? I will tell you. Yes-
terday, Sunday, most of us thought we 
were going to move with this, but then 
NANCY PELOSI decided it is time to play 
politics, decided to throw a grenade 
into this whole process. She had a list 
of demands—an over 1,000-page bill she 
drops out of nowhere—and the demands 
she is pushing, I ask you, do these have 
anything to do with the coronavirus 
epidemic? 
A number of people have cited the 
famed quote of Rahm Emanuel: ‘‘Never 
let a good crisis go to waste.’’ Sadly, 
we are seeing the embodiment of that 
cynical approach right now because all 
of the people out of jobs, the Demo-
crats are using to push—what are they 
pushing for? Changing the emissions 
standards for airplanes. What the hell 
do the emissions standards for air-
planes have to do with millions of peo-
ple out of work during the coronavirus 
epidemic? Don’t treat this bill like a 
partisan Christmas. 
Republicans have things we would 
like to advance, too, things I believe in 
deeply. You want to talk about what I 
would like to do? I would like to abol-
ish the IRS. I campaigned all over the 
country for that. I will continue fight-
ing for that, but I am not standing here 
with an amendment, saying: As part of 
this emergency relief, let’s abolish the 
IRS. There is a place for that political 
and policy discussion. 
The Democrats are pushing wind and 
solar tax credits. What in the hell does 
a windmill have to do with this crisis, 
other than some Democratic lobbyists 
getting fat and rich, and they are will-
ing to extort a crisis to try to advance 
their political agenda? 
There are mandates on corporate 
board diversity. So these are Demo-
crats who want to social-engineer. Lis-
ten, I actually have a lot of problems 
with corporate boards. We have far too 
many corporate boards that are docile 
and do what management wants. That 
is a serious problem. There is a lot of 
discussion about stock buybacks. I tell 
you, what I am concerned about with 
stock buybacks is when you have com-
pensation agreements in place that the 
executives get rich if they get a short- 
term boost in share price, and it ends 
up hurting the shareholders. I would 
love to see more vigorous boards of di-
rectors that make sure you are not cre-
ating incentives to gain a stock price. 
That is a reasonable question. But they 
want to mandate, effectively, quotas 
on boards of directors. What in the hell 
does that have to do with this crisis? 
The Pelosi wish list wants to restruc-
ture the debt of the post office. Last 
time I checked, our postal workers go 
through wind and rain and snow, but 
they haven’t been laid off. 
I call upon both sides—don’t play 
games with this. This crisis isn’t going 
to end tomorrow. It is not going to end 
the next day. It is going to last for a 
considerable time. It is going to re-
quire adults to step up and lead. 
On the pandemic, we need to follow 
the science. We need to listen to the 
doctors. We need to listen to the physi-
cians. We need to take the steps we are 
taking to keep people safe. 
On the economy, we need to give peo-
ple who are hurting immediate relief, 
and we need to make sure a liquidity 
crisis doesn’t become a solvency crisis. 
It is interesting—many Democrats 
are saying they don’t want corporate

bailouts. I agree. I am passionately op-
posed to corporate bailouts. One of the 
things I was gratefully relieved about 
as far as how this bill was structured is 
that it is structured as loans and not 
condition-free grants. It is structured 
primarily so that it is not picking fa-
vored companies that happen to have a 
big lobbying presence in Washington. 
What does it mean to not have a li-
quidity crisis become a solvency crisis? 
Let’s take, for example, the airlines. I 
have spoken with every major airline 
CEO in the past 2 weeks. The airlines 
are losing billions of dollars every 
month. They didn’t cause this problem. 
Unlike the financial crisis in 2008, this 
crisis was not caused by misconduct of 
one industry or another. It is not the 
airlines’ fault that the Federal Govern-
ment has shut down flights to Asia and 
to Europe. That is not their fault. It is 
not the fault of the owner of a res-
taurant in downtown Houston that the 
city of Houston has shut down the res-
taurant. It is not the small business 
owner’s fault. 
What we don’t want is, when the bills 
come due for all of those businesses, for 
them to have to sell their assets in a 
fire sale. We don’t want the restaurant 
owner who has a pizzeria, who has 
saved to buy this fantastic pizza oven, 
to have to sell the pizza oven for pen-
nies on the dollar because a liquidity 
crisis has become a solvency crisis. We 
don’t want our U.S. airlines to put up 
a garage sale effectively to sell all 
their airplanes because they are going 
bankrupt in the midst of a crisis. We 
want to come out of this with a strong, 
robust commercial airlines sector. We 
want to come out of this with small 
businesses thriving. We want to come 
out of this with a thriving energy sec-
tor. We want to come out of this with 
jobs. 
I will close this the way I started—by 
calling on Democrats and calling on 
Republicans to rise above petty par-
tisan games. The Democratic leaders 
are playing these games to every one of 
you Democrats. Listen to the men and 
women in your States. Don’t give in to 
the games. Most of the Democratic 
Senators say they don’t even know 
what their side wants. But it is just 
their leadership that is willing to hold 
the American people hostage for unre-
lated, political, partisan objectives. 
By the way, one of the reasons I 
think Senate Democrats are so willing 
to engage in this is they expect the 
media to be utterly complicit in their 
cynical gamesmanship. So we stand 
here this afternoon—and it is not only 
the Democratic side of the Chamber 
that is empty, but as I look up to the 
press, nobody is there. There is not a 
single reporter sitting in the Chamber. 
I have seen the New York Times—actu-
ally, nobody is sitting in the Chamber, 
so they may have closed the Chamber, 
in which case that may have been an 
unfair assault. But it is not an unfair 
assault to say that the New York 
Times is changing its headline to give 
political cover to Senate Democrats. 
This is a time of crisis, not a time to 
play games. It is time to rise above. It 
is a time to stand for the American 
men and women. It is a time to stand 
for jobs. It is a time to help protect 
people’s lives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we 
have heard a lot of passion here on the 
Senate floor this afternoon, a lot of 
anger, a lot of frustration. It stems 
from the anxiety, the anger, and the 
frustration that are being felt across 
the country right now as Americans 
from Alaska to Arkansas are faced 
with the reality of this new day—a 
Monday that they thought they could 
just never imagine. Last week, they 
had a healthy business and going con-
cern, and now that business has been 
ordered shut down. It is a Monday 
where we thought the kids were going 
back to school after spring break, and 
now it has been announced that not 
only are they not going back after a 
longer spring break, but right now in 
my State, it has been extended until 
May 1, the kids go back to school. I un-
derstand today from my assistant that 
in Virginia, schools are not going to be 
going back in. They will not go back in 
before the end of this school year. That 
is pretty shocking. Here we are on a 
Monday that nobody could have imag-
ined. 
About 4 hours ago, we were here on 
this floor to conduct a vote on a mo-
tion to proceed to cloture—a motion to 
get on to a bill that had been worked 
through by good men and women on 
both sides for days now. It hit bumps. 
We do that around here. That is the na-
ture of legislating. But this is not a 
time for the bumps to derail us. This is 
not time that we have that is unlim-
ited to extend debate, to extend a proc-
ess when we have folks back home 
whom we answer to who are angry, 
frustrated, and anxious. At the end of 
that vote, you heard anger from col-
leagues saying this was a type of polit-
ical gamesmanship, brinksmanship— 
call it whatever you will. This is not 
what the American people deserve, and 
this is not what we should be doing as 
a Senate. 
Our leader asked us: So where are 
we? Where are we right now? I think he 
was speaking more of where are we in 
the process. We can ask that question 
in this body and say: Are we mere 
hours away from being able to reach 
agreement here? Where we are in the 
views of so many who are watching 
this right now, where the Republicans 
are saying ‘‘We must move on this now. 
We don’t have time to wait. Daylight is 
a-wasting’’ to a response that ‘‘We are 
still working. We are still working. We 
are going to try to get this done’’—no, 
we can’t just try to get this done. 
I was asked about what I thought 
about the failure to come together on a 
vote last evening, and I said failure is 
not an option. Plain and simple, failure 
is not an option. So we are continuing 
to work, but as we work, let’s think 
about where the people we work for are 
right now. 
We may say that we are stuck on 
some matters. We have people who are 
stuck in places that they never could 
have imagined on this Monday. We 
have about 19 Alaskans who are stuck 
in Peru, trying to get out of a country 
that has literally gone on lockdown. 
We were in a long conversation yester-
day with the folks at the State Depart-
ment, trying to figure out how to help 
them and how to help their families 
who are back home in Alaska, who are 
calling my office every day—some-
times multiple times a day—saying: 
What are you doing to help? What are 
you doing to help not only those 19 
Alaskans get out of a place like Peru 
but the pregnant woman with several 
children, the minor exchange student, 
and the families who are over there. 
Many of my colleagues were part of 
that call who were not only interested 
in those who were stuck in Peru but 
those who were in Guatemala and Hon-
duras and El Salvador and other parts. 
We got a good group out of Morocco. 
We are getting calls from Alaskans 
who were seeking to leave the State for 
other services. They get on the Alcan 
Highway, and they are dealing with the 
reality of a Canadian border closure to 
all nonessential traffic. So we get the 
calls: What happens if we are going 
down to Seattle for medical? Is the vet-
eran who is in the car, who is going 
down for medical purposes—is this an 
essential trip for him? They are saying: 
What about the spouse in the car? 
Maybe. We don’t know. The uncer-
tainty then comes to those individuals 
about being stuck. 
We are not stuck here. Those are the 
people you think about. What are we 
doing to help them? This talk doesn’t 
help them. It is not giving them any 
degree of certainty or any degree of re-
lief or any belief that we can get any-
thing done. They are looking to us to 
help them. 
Right now, my hometown, Anchor-
age, is under a hunker-down order. Our 
mayor decided he didn’t want to call it 
a stay-at-home order or just a stand- 
down order. It is a hunker-down order, 
and that hunker-down order went in 
place last night. It will go through the 
end of the month here. 
Last week—last Monday—I got a call 
from the mayor, who said: I am going 
to be closing down all the bars, all the 
restaurants, and the entertainment fa-
cilities. We have to work on contain-
ment because, here in Alaska, we are 
kind of at the end of the supply chain, 
and it is a pretty scary place to be 
right now. So what defense do we have? 
We are going to be really aggressive on 
this shelter in place. 
My son is a small businessman who 
provides to the restaurants in town, so 
when the order comes out that the res-
taurants are shut down, what does a 
small businessman, like my 26-year-old 
son—where does he go? How does he 
move forward from that Monday to 
this Monday? It is pretty scary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1949 
March 23, 2020 
We went from a situation on Monday 
of last week, when it was just one mu-
nicipality that ordered the closure of 
restaurants and bars, to the following 
day—the entire State has a full-on clo-
sure. We are a State that is isolated 
from everybody else in the continental 
United States. We fly to get home. It is 
a fact of our lives. 
We had a letter signed by multiple 
emergency 
room 
doctors 
just 
last 
week, urging the Governor to ban non-
essential air travel. Think about what 
that means. It is pretty debilitating for 
a State like mine. You might say: Well, 
that is not going to happen. 
Well, let me tell you what is hap-
pening. Right now, nonessential travel 
is—there is a strict advisory against 
nonessential travel to the State and 
within the State. We have villages in 
the interior part of the State, predomi-
nantly, that are banning outsiders 
from coming into the village by air-
plane. So that might mean visitors 
coming in; this time of year, it is pret-
ty tough to have a big tourism indus-
try in the interior part of the Alaska, 
but the reality is, that also means 
those planes that would be bringing 
your supplies—now, if there is a med-
ical emergency, they would ask for re-
lief. 
This is how extreme the actions are 
because, in Alaska, we fully felt the 
impact of the Spanish influenza that 
took out whole villages a century ago. 
Our Native communities, as remote 
and isolated as they are, are absolutely 
fearful that we will see a repeat of that 
Spanish influenza. So if we have to 
shut off all economic activity, we are 
doing that. 
This weekend, a huge effort was 
made to move our homeless popu-
lations out of the crowded shelters into 
the shut-down sports arena and hockey 
arena so that we can put them in an 
area and a place where there is, hope-
fully, sufficient 6-foot distancing. 
The hotels around the State—I have 
listened to our colleagues. We are all in 
the same situation with the impact 
that is happening to our businesses as 
we are shutting down, and these busi-
ness owners are making the difficult 
decisions that they are. 
This morning, the faxes that I got— 
the Quality Inn in Kodiak, AK, is lay-
ing off 13 jobs. This is from the Baranof 
hotel in Juneau—most of us who have 
ever spent any time talking to our leg-
islators know this is our most signifi-
cant hotel in our capital city—laying 
off 45 hotel positions. 
This is a reality that for them, as 
they are watching what is happening 
here in the Senate—or perhaps the in-
action that is happening here before 
the cameras—they are saying: Do I 
have alternatives to these layoffs? Will 
there be the level of support for me to 
keep my employees retained and to 
keep our community moving forward? 
I received a text from a friend who 
owns Chena Hot Springs Resort. He has 
owned that resort now for 22 years. It 
has never closed since he has had it in 
operation, but he is in a position now 
where he has told all 90 of his employ-
ees: You can stay here; we are not 
open; we will feed you. 
My hope is that Bernie is going to be 
able to keep those 90 employees and 
that he is going to be able to pay them 
through the proposal that we have 
built into this legislation that we have 
an opportunity to move, if we can only 
do so. 
His ask to me in that text was not 
‘‘Make sure that it is a $150 billion’’ or 
‘‘It has to be at $1.5 trillion.’’ Do you 
know what he ended his text to me 
with? He said: We need to make Amer-
ica kind again. He wants to take care 
of his family, his work family, and he 
wants to know we are going to be re-
sponsive to that and that we will show 
that kindness that we would all hope 
would come. 
I am so discouraged as I listen to the 
nature of the partisan words that are 
on this floor today because that is the 
last thing this body needs. That is the 
last thing this country needs. They 
need assurance from us. They need to 
have confidence that we get the ur-
gency, that we hear their cries, and 
that we are not just sitting back here 
bickering because I haven’t got my No. 
1 project or if we are going to make 
this even-steven—if there needs to be 
one Republican priority, then there 
needs to be another Democratic pri-
ority over there. 
Do you know what? We all represent 
people of different political persua-
sions. My job as a Senator from the 
State of Alaska is to represent all 
those Alaskans, and I would like to 
think that all Alaskans think protec-
tive equipment for our medical pro-
viders is a priority for all of us. I would 
like to think that it is a priority for all 
of us, for all Alaskans, that we say it is 
best to keep those employees as part of 
your business, to keep that held in 
place until we can get on the other side 
of the immediacy of the health crisis 
so that we can work together to avoid 
a further economic crisis. 
But, instead, this Monday, the Amer-
ican public and Alaskans who are 
counting on me back home—instead of 
being able to see this hope from their 
elected leaders that we have it and 
that we understand the urgency, what 
they see are the partisan words. What 
they see is an empty Chamber. What 
they hear is as much a measure of dys-
function as everything they see in 
their world around them right now. 
One of the things our Governor has 
done—and, man, he has made some 
hard choices in the past week to 10 
days. He has made some decisions that 
will have significant and serious eco-
nomic impact on a State that is al-
ready on its knees. 
One of the things he did was put to-
gether what he is calling the Alaska 
economic stabilization task force. This 
conservative Republican Governor has 
appointed two cochairs. One cochair is 
a former Republican Governor, Sean 
Parnell, and the other one is one many 
of my colleagues here in the Senate 
know, former Senator Mark Begich. 
Politically, you couldn’t have two 
more different guys who are at the 
head of this task force, but it sent a 
signal to Alaskans: Look, we are all in 
this together. There are no Republican 
solutions; there are no Democrat solu-
tions. They are just solutions, and we 
better figure them out. The State of 
Alaska is working really hard to do 
that. 
I was just visiting with some of our 
Alaska labor leaders, and in addition to 
the issues we are talking about, they 
are telling me their members are out 
making personal protective equipment. 
They are getting the sewing machines 
out; they are getting the fabrics at 
JOANN Fabric, and they are just mak-
ing things. They are doing what needs 
to be done. 
We are reminded that so much good 
can come together if we just kind of 
lay down our partisan arms and say: 
What do we need to do for this coun-
try? What do you want for Arkansas? 
What do we need for Alaska? What do 
we need for one another? Right now, we 
don’t need the words that just further 
separate us as Americans. 
I haven’t talked about the contents 
of the bill that we have in front of us 
because so many before me this after-
noon have. I think we all share the de-
sire—I hope we all share the desire to 
get this done readily and to get it done 
quickly 
because 
right 
now—right 
now—Americans are losing hope. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, growing 
up, my dad used to tell me on a regular 
basis: ‘‘You should never speak up un-
less you can improve upon the silence.’’ 
I tried to take that to heart in my per-
sonal life and in my professional life. 
Today I feel like I can improve upon 
the silence. I have a deep conviction 
that the U.S. Senate is not living up to 
the expectations of the American peo-
ple. The American people deserve a 
U.S. Senate as good as the American 
people. They deserve a U.S. Senate 
that is responsive when they need gov-
ernment most. 
I suppose it is fashionable these days 
to use so many of our institutions in 
society to elevate ourselves. Well, 
folks, this institution—this institu-
tion—its credibility is at stake. The 
American people need this institution 
to function. 
I was a U.S. marine after graduating 
from college, and I never saw a war. I 
never saw a national emergency or a 
major crisis. I am very straightforward 
about that, but I have to say, I was 
ready for a war. I was prepared for that 
big day when the United States of 
America really, really needed me, and I 
made sure all of my marines were pre-
pared. We were prepared to do our duty 
when it mattered most. 
As it relates to this pandemic, I have 
to say that the American people are 
ready. Look around. It makes you 
proud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1950 
March 23, 2020 
Are we not a unified people? Are we 
a Tribal people? There is a lot of con-
versation about that among political 
circles. Spend some time in my neigh-
borhood. Spend some time back home 
in Indiana right now. Maybe it took 
some 
separation, 
some 
social 
distancing. Maybe it took some time 
away from work, some time away from 
social gatherings. Maybe it took can-
cellation, 
unfortunately, 
of 
March 
Madness, the NCAA tournament, to re-
mind us all that we are deeply con-
nected with one another. And we long 
for those connections, regardless of po-
litical philosophy and regardless of the 
fact that we have an election going on. 
That is not what is real important to 
regular people. 
Americans 
are 
coming 
together. 
They are ready for this emergency, and 
this is, indeed, an emergency. Make no 
mistake, look across the country at all 
the National Guards who are being mo-
bilized. 
This is an emergency that people in 
my home State have been responding 
to favorably. The Senate needs to as 
well. Folks in my neighborhood are 
putting bags of groceries on people’s 
doorsteps who are unable to go out and 
get groceries themselves. I know this 
from my own family. They are calling 
senior citizens they know who they 
think are probably lonely at this time. 
They are coming together. 
Back 
in 
Evansville, 
one 
of 
my 
friends, J.P., who is a business owner 
and very active in the community, and 
I were on the phone the other day. I 
think, like other Members, I have had 
countless phone calls in the last week 
or so with businessowners, not-for-prof-
it leaders, healthcare providers, and 
rank-and-file citizens. This active cit-
izen, this community leader, J.P. in 
Evansville, says that he was on the 
phone with the mayor, local business 
leaders, local healthcare leaders, and a 
bunch of others from Southern Indiana, 
and they were all on the same page. 
They have figured out how to come to-
gether, how to solve local problems to-
gether. They were all ready to tackle 
this because they sensed what we 
should all sense: The sooner you can 
tackle these challenges, the sooner the 
pain will end, and the sooner we will 
reduce anxiety among our neighbors. 
They are all determined to work to-
gether. In fact, he said he had not seen 
such unity within the community of 
Evansville, IN, since 9/11. It says a lot. 
Well, the Senate must be ready. This 
package, the CARES Act, was nego-
tiated in a bipartisan way—two Demo-
crats, two Republicans, in consultation 
with each of the varying working 
groups. They put together a package. 
It all came together, and it was intro-
duced. It was all bipartisan until it 
came time to vote on a procedural vote 
yesterday. 
You know, this virus may seem to 
many small because it has impacted a 
small percentage of our population di-
rectly, but I have to say that its im-
pact is growing rapidly. The longer it 
takes us to come together, the more 
damage that is going to be done. This 
is an emergency. 
It is time, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, to take yes for an an-
swer and not play games. 
So what does this bill do? It is noth-
ing controversial. It provides addi-
tional assistance for healthcare needs. 
This is a pandemic. We need more 
masks. We need more PPEs. Our hos-
pitals are swamped. They can’t conduct 
elective surgeries anymore. Their fi-
nances are out of whack. We need to 
help them out. 
What else does it do? It helps indi-
vidual Americans. Folks are resource- 
constrained right now. They can’t go 
to work. So 1,200 bucks, at least for 
starters, per American; $2,400 per mar-
ried couple; and an additional $500 if 
you have dependents—that is really 
going to make a difference in Hoosiers’ 
lives. 
We need to make sure that people 
have lives to go back to once we get 
through this, as well, and that is why 
this legislation is designed to provide 
much needed liquidity for these busi-
nesses. They still have debts to pay. 
They still have debts. They want to 
make payroll. 
I can’t tell you—I mean, I have 
talked to so many small businessmen 
in tears. I have talked to leaders of our 
largest corporations as well. I will tell 
you, I talked to a lady who didn’t 
think things looked real good. We 
didn’t really have a whole lot of time 
to respond to this. Meeting payroll, 
paying for rent, paying your leases, 
paying for mortgages, these are the es-
sentials, folks. 
And this is not 2008. That was a hor-
rible crisis. But we are coming off of 
the best economy, arguably, in five 
decades. And because the economy was 
so good, people were optimistic about 
the future. And through no fault of 
their own, businessmen did sort of the 
rational thing. They invested in the fu-
ture, the property, the plant, and the 
equipment that is required to grow. 
They were working on taking market 
share. All of those who believe in the 
free enterprise system can associate 
ourselves with what they were trying 
to accomplish. 
But 2008 was a little different. The 
economy was lethargic. The bottom 
fell out of the economy. In sort of an 
ironic twist, when the economy is 
down, people are paying down their 
debts. They are bolstering that balance 
sheet. They are maintaining some liq-
uid assets in anticipation of further 
tough times. We don’t have that ben-
efit right now. We can measure the 
prospects of our employers in days. For 
many of them, it is too late. 
The U.S. Senate needs to treat this 
like an emergency because it is an 
emergency. 
So what else does this legislation do? 
Well, there is a category—let me just 
group it together. Let me call it, incon-
trovertibly, emergency funding. There 
is $20 billion for veterans’ healthcare; 
$11 billion for vaccines, therapeutics, 
diagnostics, and other preparedness 
needs, masks, gloves, and ventilators; 
$75 billion for hospitals; $4.5 billion for 
the Centers for Disease Control; $12 bil-
lion for America’s military as it helps 
respond to this pandemic, and so on. 
That is what the bill is all about. That 
is what we are fighting about. 
So what happened? How did things go 
off track? Well, it may surprise some 
folks, but I have a very positive rela-
tionship with the Democratic leader. 
We just happen to have a lot of prin-
cipled disagreements. And at the very 
end of a bipartisan process, when he 
and other Members of his caucus try 
and insert provisions pertaining to the 
Green New Deal and other far-left pri-
orities into this package, then, that, of 
course, disrupts our emergency re-
sponse. 
So now we have Speaker PELOSI, 
seemingly, hijacking the process. That 
is right. She is over in the House of 
Representatives. She is not even part 
of this body, and her folks are all 
home. The House isn’t in session, but 
Speaker PELOSI wanted to remain rel-
evant. She decided she wanted to get 
some TV time, I suppose, and so her 
proposal involves federalizing voting. 
We can have an honest debate about 
whether it is appropriate to federalize 
the voting system, to mandate early 
voting, or same-day voter registration. 
That is something that should be de-
bated in the U.S. Senate because I 
know it is a priority for so many of my 
colleagues. 
Again, there are elements of the 
Green New Deal. We can debate wheth-
er or not there has to be a full offset of 
airline emissions by 2025 some other 
time. We can debate whether or not 
greenhouse gas statistics for individual 
flights should be widely available. 
Let’s work on that separately after we 
help the American people. Let’s not 
work on pet priorities. We can debate 
permanent paid leave—permanent paid 
leave granted by the Federal Govern-
ment some other time. This is a pan-
demic. It is an economic emergency, a 
public health emergency. The Amer-
ican people want a response. They 
don’t want us to focus on this right 
now. 
I made a lot of phone calls in recent 
days back home. None of this is pos-
sible without the wherewithal, without 
the hard work of sturdy Americans, 
and without great American innova-
tion, none of the resources that are re-
quired to actually sustain our govern-
ment, to feed our families. People need 
places to work. 
Here is what is happening in Indiana, 
a little snapshot. The RV industry, the 
global headquarters of the recreational 
vehicle industry, is in Elkhart, IN. We 
are seeing RV companies temporarily 
shutting down in Indiana, and I know 
we are seeing it across the country. 
The hotel industry, today, the two 
largest hotels in Indianapolis had to 
shut their doors. I am not just talking 
about buildings shutting their doors;

March 23, 2020 
this closure is going to mean the loss 
of employment for about 780 full-time 
workers. Think of all of the family 
members who depend on those workers. 
This is an emergency. 
The auto industry—Hoosiers proudly 
manufacture the components for the 
auto industry. They assemble those 
components into finished automobiles. 
That industry has been brought to a 
halt on account of this unique crisis, 
and the worst, we hear, is yet to come. 
Airlines, they are feeling the most 
immediate impact. I flew the other day 
from my home in the Indianapolis area. 
I flew out of the airport to Washington, 
DC. It wasn’t a chartered flight. I was 
the only passenger. I was the only pas-
senger on the aircraft. We know that is 
not a sustainable business model when 
you are paying for the fuel, you have a 
pilot, a copilot, a flight attendant, and 
me. This is an emergency. St. Elmo 
Steak House is one restaurant of the 
restaurants across Indiana that have 
had to close their doors. St. Elmo just 
had to do it. It is the first time it has 
had to do it since 1902. They were even 
able to keep their doors open in the 
midst of the 1918 flu pandemic. 
This is bad. This is an emergency. 
The Senate needs to act. 
We have Sanjay Patel. He is the 
president of an Indianapolis-based com-
pany, and he and my team spoke re-
cently. He said that he had to lay off at 
least 100 workers just last week, with 
another 150 layoffs likely this week. 
These are families. These are individ-
uals who take pride in their work. 
They want to go back to work. 
Here is what Sanjay said: 
We’re thinking of closing a few of them 
here—it’s just deteriorating every day. It 
was worse last night than the night before, 
and it was worse the night before than 2 days 
ago. It’s just deteriorating and I think it’s 
just a matter of time [until] we close down. 
It is an emergency. It is not time for 
NANCY PELOSI’s priorities. It is time for 
the American people’s priorities. 
We have a baking shop with locations 
in Carmel and Indianapolis that had to 
lay some workers off. Their owner said: 
My heart goes out to my Cake Bake fam-
ily, whom I was forced to lay off during this 
horrible virus. I am working with my banks, 
my insurance company, my accountant and 
the government to try and create some sort 
of relief support for my team. I am doing ev-
erything in my power to help all 170 of them. 
All tips received at both of our bakery 
counters will be divided and shared with our 
servers. Hoping to get through this difficult 
time together, coming out on the other end 
with the safety and health for our families. 
I heard from a small optometry prac-
tice in North Vernon. They have 12 em-
ployees. The owner says: 
We simply don’t have the cash to fund 
their wages while they are off work. I am 
saving what cash I have to pay them, their 
vacation and personal day time. We are in 
trouble and need help. 
This isn’t somebody who is used to 
asking for help. This is the time to give 
them help. Let’s not allow this legisla-
tion to be hijacked. Let’s live up to the 
high standards of the American people. 
At this difficult moment, let’s come to-
gether like we did in 9/11, like our 
country has so consistently when the 
chips are really down. 
Let’s all take part in this effort. I en-
courage all of my constituents and 
anyone else around the country to en-
courage 
your 
Senators—Republicans 
and Democrats alike. Stand up. Speak 
out. Send emails. Tell your neighbors. 
It is time for this body to move. It is 
time for us to deal with this crisis once 
and for all. We will make America 
great again from the bottom up. It 
doesn’t have to take that long. We can 
bounce back, but the longer we wait, 
the harder it will be. Let’s do our jobs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are 
getting a lot of redundancy around 
here, but it is worth it. I have been sit-
ting here for several hours now listen-
ing to my colleagues. I don’t recall, in 
the 25 years I have been here, seeing 
this happening, over and over. And ev-
erything that is said is so significant. 
The Senator from Alaska talked 
about the fact that we are all in this 
together. We are, and things were 
going well for a while. I am actually 
going to, I think, end with a little bit 
of optimism right now. I may be the 
only one doing that, because I think 
something is going to happen tonight. I 
think it has to happen tonight. We 
don’t have the luxury of waiting. 
Now, I have never seen a crisis like 
this. We are not used to dealing with 
crises. Gosh, we have been through 
wars. We have been through things 
that we have considered to be crises. 
This is a different dimension. We are 
talking about people who are dying. 
As for the coronavirus, we all know 
where it came from: Wuhan in China. It 
has caused global panic. By the way, 
they call it a pandemic. There is a rea-
son for that, because this isn’t just 
something happening in the United 
States of America. This is happening 
all over the world—everywhere. No one 
is immune. This is something that we 
don’t have a cure for right now. 
The Senator from Indiana kept using 
the word ‘‘emergency.’’ This is an 
emergency. It is an emergency unlike 
any that we have seen so far. It is 
something that is highly contagious, 
something that we can’t do anything 
about. No one is immune. 
As of Sunday, according to the World 
Health Organization, there were 292,000 
cases globally and almost 13,000 deaths. 
Let me put that in a different perspec-
tive because I have had the honor, in 
the last several days—and I am talking 
about including the weekend—of talk-
ing to people in Oklahoma. 
I think, this morning, we talked to 
every single radio, television, and 
newspaper in the State. I always start 
my speeches, to make sure everyone 
understands, with why this is not any-
thing we have done before, why it is so 
significant. I explain to people: Today 
is the 23rd. Let’s take the 22nd and the 
21st. If you go back to the 21st—or let’s 
say March 20, which was last Friday— 
we had, at that time, 210,000 cases that 
were known. They have been infected. 
Two days later, it was 322,000. 
Now look at the ones who have died. 
On March 20, it was 8,800 people died. 
But 2 days after that, it was 13,714. 
Now, that is globally. 
Look at here in the United States of 
America. On March 20, there were 
10,500 people who contracted it, and 
then, just 2 days later, it was 31,000. It 
tripled in 2 days. That is what we are 
facing right now. On the deaths, they 
tripled—the same thing: 150 deaths on 
March 20, and 390 deaths on the 22nd, 2 
days later. 
Now, that puts it in a different cat-
egory. We have never had anything like 
that to talk about. The reason I do 
that, when I am talking to people in 
Oklahoma, is that, like a lot of people, 
I have been in this position before, 
when it looks like we are overreacting 
and we look like we are creating a cri-
sis—something that hasn’t happened 
before. But, in this case, this is a crisis. 
So it is important. There are a lot of 
people around who are thinking: Well, 
you know, this is kind of manufac-
tured. It is not that big of a deal. 
In this case, it is. So, at the same 
time, we have thousands of Americans 
who are losing their jobs. We have been 
listening to this on the floor for a long 
period of time, and sometimes it is im-
portant to be redundant, to talk about 
these things, about people who are 
being forced to shut down without any 
sense when they might reopen. 
You are spared probably 15 minutes 
or so of the examples that I had in my 
State of Oklahoma—bakeries and oth-
ers. The Senator from Indiana did a 
good job, and I think it would be un-
necessary to go over all of that. We all 
have those stories. There is not a Mem-
ber—Democrat or Republican—in this 
body who has not had these experiences 
and who could talk about the experi-
ences. 
So we started working. This is going 
to sound pretty phony when I say this, 
but I was so proud, and I talked about 
how proud I was of the Democrats be-
cause, until just yesterday, we were all 
working together. We were having our 
meetings. I was with MITCH MCCON-
NELL, and he was showing the progress 
we were having. The Democrats were 
cooperating. We really thought really 
good things were going to happen. We 
really believed that. 
So we have been working around the 
clock in bipartisan negotiations, and 
we believed that this weekend substan-
tial progress was being made on a com-
prehensive phase 3. 
Now, let’s keep in mind that this is 
phase 3 that we are talking about now. 
This is the one that I anticipate to-
night we will vote successfully on. We 
have to do that. If we don’t do it, peo-
ple are going to die. This is not like it 
is going to cost so much money or 
some people are going to be inconven-
ienced. People are dying. 
So we had these bipartisan negotia-
tions, and I thought we were doing

March 23, 2020 
great work. While the Senate has been 
working here on solutions to this cri-
sis, the Democrat House has been on 
recess. I am not really concerned. If 
they feel they can do that, that is fine. 
But that didn’t stop the Speaker of 
the House, and this is where the prob-
lem came in. See, everything was great 
until last night, up until the vote time. 
We were going to vote at 6 last night, 
and we thought we were going to be 
successful in that vote at 6 last night. 
What we didn’t know is that the 
Speaker came back, even though they 
are on recess, and she threw a wrench 
into everything that we are doing, all 
the bipartisan talks. She came to town 
and decided to make this a partisan ex-
ercise. House Democrats are now de-
manding that the far-left wish of rad-
ical policies be included in what is oth-
erwise a bipartisan agreement. 
I think their feeling was this: We are 
going to spend all this money. We have 
to get everything in there. If it has 
nothing to do with the crisis, if it has 
nothing to do with the virus, then, this 
is the time to do it. So the idea was 
that they wanted to spend more. 
I think the Senator from Indiana did 
a good job of talking about some of the 
provisions that we are talking about, 
but I want to ask: Is there anybody out 
there right now who is a conservative? 
Is there anyone out there who has real-
ly kept track of what kind of spending 
we are talking about here? 
We have never seen anything like it. 
Remember phase 1. That was the $8.3 
billion emergency supplemental. That 
was for State and local response and 
testing kits, and that is fine. People 
understood that. That was $8.3 billion 
in phase 1. 
Phase 2 came along. By the way, I 
have to admit that this was the one 
phase I voted against for this reason: 
Oklahoma is a little different than a 
lot of other States. We have a larger 
number of small businesses in Okla-
homa than most other States have, and 
they are the ones we have been talking 
to. We have been talking to them be-
cause they are going to be recognizing 
that, after all the efforts they have 
made in their careers and what they 
have done, they are going to go out of 
business. 
So one of the things they said that 
had to be corrected was found in phase 
2. In phase 2, it says there that, when 
they mandate small business do things 
like paid leave and other expenses, it is 
fine for them to go ahead and do that 
if the Federal Government is going to 
refund the expenses for that. And they 
were going to do it, but not for several 
weeks. So our position was—those of us 
who had a lot of small businesses—that 
we want to make sure that, when phase 
3 comes, we have a provision in there 
that will change that, in the event that 
you end up having to pay for mandated 
things—paid leave and other things for 
your employees. That is great. It is 
great that you are doing it because 
there is no other way in this crisis we 
are in the middle of that they can do 
it. But they are going to change it. So, 
in this thing that we are going to be 
voting on, hopefully, tonight—and I 
think we are—it is going to change it 
so that they will be reimbursed when 
that time comes. 
Now, those who are conservatives out 
there, I want you to keep track of what 
we are talking about here. Get a pencil 
and paper out. Write these things 
down. I want you to know what we are 
talking about. 
The total amount of this phase 3 is 
going to be somewhere around $1.6 tril-
lion. That is a ‘‘t’’ we are talking 
about—not billion. This is a trillion. 
If you look at the things that are in 
there, like the major problems and the 
corrections that were made in phase 2, 
that is a part of this that is going on. 
For small businesses it is $350 billion. 
Write it down and add it up as we go 
along here—$350 billion. That is to take 
care of some of the problems that came 
out that weren’t addressed in phase 2. 
We are talking about loans up to $10 
million to individuals through 2020. All 
employers with up to 500 employees are 
eligible for this. The repayment of 
that—these are loans, but that is going 
to be delayed for 1 year. They don’t 
have to pay back a portion of the loan, 
but most of that would have to be paid 
back. That is $350 billion. 
Healthcare provisions. We have $75 
billion that goes to hospitals and 
healthcare providers throughout the 
country. These are mostly for the larg-
er hospitals. You have a smaller 
amount—$275 million—that would ex-
pand services to rural hospitals. 
In the State of Oklahoma, we have a 
lot of rural hospitals. A lot of our rural 
hospitals have gone under. 
I can remember one time, back when 
Bill Clinton was the President, we had 
this great thing, and all my conserv-
ative friends were voting to support 
this. This was a budget balance amend-
ment that would bring down the def-
icit, but it was doing it on the backs of 
rural hospitals. At that time, I was 
ranked as the most conservative Mem-
ber in the U.S. Senate, and I voted 
against it. All of my conservative 
friends said: Wait a minute; how can 
you do that? We can do that because in 
the State of Oklahoma, we have to 
take care of our rural hospitals. 
That is in there—$275 million. Add it 
up. Write it down. 
There is $3.5 billion for vaccine devel-
opment. That has to be done. We have 
to find a cure for this. Every day, you 
hear new ideas coming along. Is it the 
same thing that can be done for ma-
laria? Is it the same thing that can be 
done for other problems? Again, the 
cost is there. We are going to have to 
do that. That is $3.5 billion. 
There is a $2 billion item for a na-
tional security stockpile. How many 
people know that there is such a thing 
as a national security stockpile? They 
don’t know. I am a Member of the U.S. 
Senate, and I can’t even tell you where 
it is. The reason I can’t is because it is 
classified. People are not supposed to 
know where it is. Nonetheless, there 
are things like masks, gowns, ventila-
tors, and that type of thing. It is a 
smaller amount—only $2 billion—but 
write it down, and put it in there. 
There is $500 billion for support of in-
dividuals. This is the one I hear mostly 
about from conservatives. Conserv-
atives, listen carefully. There is going 
to be a cash payment to individuals of 
$1,200—$1,200. Here is a check for $1,200. 
That would be for people in categories 
where they—they are not wealthy peo-
ple. If they are married, it wouldn’t be 
$1,200; it would be $2,400. That is per in-
dividual. If they have kids, for each 
kid, it would be $500 additional. 
That is out there, and that is a part 
of this thing that a lot of people and 
particularly conservatives look at and 
don’t like. This is different. This is dif-
ferent from anything else we have done 
before. We are trying to survive right 
now. People are dying every day. I hope 
I don’t have to go out and repeat what 
we started out with on how many peo-
ple are dying every day. 
Unemployment benefits. Think of the 
cost of that—39 weeks of unemploy-
ment benefits for the coronavirus job 
losses. In addition to that, they have 
benefits that increase by $600 a week. 
Usually, it is the States that pay for it. 
The States can’t do it. 
My State of Oklahoma—we have a 
great Governor in Oklahoma, Kevin 
Stitt. Yet he is not able to do that. We 
never anticipated the expenses we are 
going to have. We never anticipated 
what has happened to our income—the 
revenues that come into the State that 
we have always expected since state-
hood in Oklahoma, which was not that 
long ago compared to other States. 
That is something we know the cost of, 
and we have never had to have the loss 
of revenue in the State of Oklahoma 
like we are having today. 
Unemployment benefits. There is 39 
weeks of unemployment benefits for 
the job losses on coronavirus. We are 
talking about, on unemployment bene-
fits, $600 a week. As I said, normally 
that is paid for by the State but not in 
this case. 
Emergency loans for distressed in-
dustries in States: $500 billion in total. 
People are talking about it. The speak-
er before me talked about coming here 
in an empty airplane. I came in on 
Monday, a week ago today, and there 
were only 14 people on a 737 airplane. 
Obviously, that is something that can’t 
continue. We also have to take care of 
the cargo people. It is $50 billion for 
passenger air and $8 billion for cargo 
air. 
I say this because I want you to keep 
adding this stuff up. 
Then you have another figure: $17 bil-
lion for national security firms. 
That leaves about $425 billion for the 
Treasury if they determine something 
has been overlooked, so they can take 
care of that. 
I started out with saying that I want 
the conservatives in America to be lis-
tening because as of now, GovTrack

S1953 
March 23, 2020 
had me down as the most conservative 
Member of the U.S. Senate. So I want 
people who have been adding this up to 
realize that even I, with that back-
ground, am saying we are dealing with 
something we have never dealt with be-
fore. 
As we look and we see the tax credits 
for solar and some of these things that 
were a part of the liberal agenda, this 
is something that is going on, and that 
is what we are dealing with right now. 
Everything 
was 
great 
until 
last 
night, and we were making great head-
way. I was complimenting the Demo-
crats on the cooperation we had, and 
we can get that back again. But this 
temporary thing came in where all of a 
sudden you have the Speaker of the 
House looking at her liberal agenda 
and saying: Hey, there is a lot of 
money out there. I have to get mine. 
Let’s get in line and do that. 
They 
want 
money for emissions 
standards. What has that got to do 
with the virus? It means nothing. It 
has nothing to do with it. It is not 
what Americans want, and these things 
have nothing to do with the crisis. 
I have to say that PELOSI is going to 
have to wake up and take this seri-
ously and stop playing political games. 
It has to happen now. It has to happen 
tonight. Stop and calculate, every day 
we take, how many people are dying 
during that time. We have never been 
faced with this before. It is time for the 
political games to quit. They want us 
to work together on this package. I 
think this is what we are going to be 
doing. 
For the last few weeks, I have been 
complimenting the Senate Democrats 
for the efforts they are making, and all 
of that came to a halt last night. I 
have been saying that this is a crisis 
where Democrats and Republicans need 
to put politics aside. That is what is 
going to have to happen. It has to hap-
pen—not, if we are lucky, next week; it 
has to happen tonight. It was until 6 
o’clock last night that Senate Demo-
crats were fully cooperating. That 
came across pretty quick. 
Let me make one comment. I know 
there are a lot of ‘‘hate Trump’’ people 
out there. I see them all the time. I 
love the guy. He has done a great job. 
When you stop and think about what 
he has done in this country—and a lot 
of people are trying to build a case to 
some of the ‘‘hate Trump’’ people that 
he didn’t move on this quickly enough. 
Well, he did. This thing happened in 
January. The first thing he did was 
stop the traffic coming into this coun-
try from China. He didn’t sit around 
and wait; he did it immediately. And 
then he declared an emergency. All of 
these things he did immediately. He 
had the daily press conferences. I hope 
people are watching those. He is sitting 
back and having the top medical people 
in America talking about the problems 
we are having. 
This is kind of good news because we 
started this thing with the best econ-
omy we have had in my lifetime. Even 
those individuals who are the ‘‘hate 
Trump’’ people have to realize that the 
economy is the best economy we have 
had. There are a couple of ways that he 
did it. First of all, there was the big 
tax cut. There are two things that 
caused this. One was the tax cut. 
I have a reason for bringing this up 
right now, at the conclusion of my re-
marks; that is, when we had the tax 
cut, it wasn’t a Republican idea, it was 
a Democratic idea. That was John Ken-
nedy. He was President in 1964. What 
did he say? He said: You know, with 
the Great Society coming on, we have 
to get more revenue. We have to get 
more revenue, and the best way to in-
crease your revenue is to decrease the 
marginal tax rates. He did it, and it 
worked. Unfortunately, he died and 
could not reap the benefits of that suc-
cess. The revenues came in rapidly at 
that time. 
Other efforts for reducing taxes have 
been successful too. President Trump 
coupled that with doing away with 
overregulation. I can remember mine. I 
was very happy that mine was the first 
bill he signed. It was a regulation. It 
was put together back during the pre-
vious administration. It said: If you are 
a domestic oil or gas company and you 
are competing for business with China 
or somebody else, you have to give 
them your whole playbook on how you 
calculated your—well, that was giving 
a distinct advantage. It was part of the 
war on fossil fuels that the President 
had at that time. When this new Presi-
dent was elected, we went ahead and 
passed a bill to repeal that regulation. 
So the overregulation—that is what 
made it very successful. 
He has appointed, right now, 190 new 
conservative judges. People who are 
not conservatives, people who don’t 
really feel that strongly about the Con-
stitution, are not excited about that— 
190 
new 
conservative 
judges. 
We 
haven’t had that many judges in the 
first term of a President in the history 
of this country—including, of course, 
two Justices to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Pro-Israel. A lot of people don’t like 
Israel. They are sympathetic with oth-
ers. But how many Presidents have 
said: We want to move the capital of 
Israel to Jerusalem. He is the one who 
has done it. 
We have rebuilt the military. How 
many people know this? I chair the 
committee. It is called the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. I had the 
responsibility of trying to get it rebuilt 
because we lost during the Obama 
years. The last 5 years of Obama, he ac-
tually reduced the amount of money 
for our defense by 25 percent. It had 
never happened before. 
I say this because we now have a 
great advantage. We are going to cor-
rect this. I think it is going to happen 
tonight. I am really optimistic it will 
because if it doesn’t, people are going 
to die. People are dying right now. 
When that happens, when we get this 
rebuilt and get beyond the crisis that 
we have all talked about today that we 
are in the middle of right now, we are 
going to go back, and we will be thank-
ing God we started this whole thing 
with one of the best economies we have 
ever had. 
When we are looking at what is hap-
pening every day—and I am not going 
to go back and repeat it, but we know 
it is happening—the number of people 
who are dying on a daily basis, every 
day we put this off, people are dying. 
For that reason, I really think that 
right now, somewhere in the Capitol, in 
a room, we have Democrats and Repub-
licans who are going to come to some 
sort of an agreement. I don’t care when 
it is—it can be midnight; it can be any-
time—it has to happen. We are out of 
time. This is a crisis. We don’t have the 
luxury of time. It is going to have to be 
done. It is going to have to be done to-
night. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is so interesting to sit here and listen 
to our colleagues because the thing 
that touches me the most is that we 
are all talking to, talking with, and lis-
tening to our constituents, and cer-
tainly Tennesseans are talking with us 
and expressing some of their fears. 
Earlier today, I had a call from a 
small business owner who is in Ten-
nessee, and she said: I am going to 
throw one of your lines back at you. 
I said: Well, what is that? 
She said: I have heard you say before 
that sometimes so-and-so was on your 
last nerve. 
I said: Yes, you have heard me say 
that. 
She said: Well, you people in Wash-
ington now are on my last nerve. 
I said: Really? 
She said: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You know, 
I don’t want my children to know that 
I am afraid. I don’t want them to hear 
me be fearful. But inside, I am scream-
ing in silence because I need you all to 
get something done. 
See, this is a typical small business 
owner. She and her husband started a 
business. They struggled until the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act came along. What 
happened? They saw growth. This Main 
Street business became their embodi-
ment of the American dream. They 
were excited. Things were good. Today 
she is saying: I don’t know if we should 
hang on to our employees. I don’t know 
if we should close the doors. I don’t 
know what we should do, and you all 
can’t make a decision. 
I told her I fully understood where 
she was because it makes me anxious 
too. It disappoints me tremendously. I 
think there is a lot to be said about ne-
gotiating in good faith and exercising 
good faith and honesty with the people 
whom you want to work with. And cer-
tainly, the majority leader and the 
task forces felt that they were working 
in good faith. What they had struc-
tured sounded really good to a lot of 
Tennesseans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1954 
March 23, 2020 
You had a bill that basically was 
healthcare assistance, food assistance, 
and 
financial 
assistance—different 
pockets. But most importantly, they 
were components that would meet the 
needs. We discussed some of these. For 
small businesses and independent con-
tractors and sole proprietors and the 
self-employed—and I do thank MARCO 
RUBIO and SUSAN COLLINS for working 
with me on making certain that we in-
cluded those entities. You are talking 
about $250 billion that would be there 
through 
unemployment 
insurance. 
These sole proprietors and small busi-
nesses would be able to go into that 
and stand themselves up by drawing 
that money down, keeping people em-
ployed, and then having it serve as a 
grant. 
Also for our rural communities, for 
telehealth and for our hospitals, there 
is $75 billion. It was a good thing. Let’s 
take healthcare to the person instead 
of the person having to move to the 
healthcare. Great. That is the common 
sense in this bill that our friends 
across the aisle walked away from. 
They walked away from it. They said 
no to the unemployment benefits, no to 
small business, no to telehealth. 
There were also additional funds that 
would be there for employers to keep 
people working so that these jobs 
would be there. 
I will tell you this. Most folks, like 
the small business owner whom I 
talked about today, are offended when 
they hear about backroom negotiations 
and private negotiations. What they 
want to see is action. They want to see 
us on this floor. They are probably a 
little bit amused that there is not one 
single Democrat coming down here to 
defend their vote—not one. They are 
not down here. They are not speaking 
up as to why they do not want to help. 
What are they willing to do? The 
House is gone. They have been gone 
now for 10 days. They are not here. 
They are not working. Speaker PELOSI 
came back. NANCY
came right back 
into town and threw a grenade into the 
negotiations. She wants to write her 
own bill. 
That bill is something. I have to tell 
you, I looked through it before I came 
down here because I thought, surely, 
they are not as far off the reservation 
as I was beginning to hear. Yes, they 
are. They want tax credits for solar en-
ergy and wind energy, which has no 
place in negotiating a package to ad-
dress the issues from COVID–19. It has 
zero connection to that. Tax credits for 
solar energy is one of their big wishes 
in the Green New Deal. They have been 
all about it. This is where they are 
going to put their emphasis. 
They had one of their Members of 
leadership say the global coronavirus 
pandemic is a ‘‘tremendous oppor-
tunity to restrict things to fit a pro-
gressive vision.’’ There they go. There 
they go again. Don’t let this crisis go 
to waste. Let’s load this up. This is the 
vehicle that is moving. Here we go. 
This is a way we can get the Green New 
Deal. This is how we can realize our so-
cialist dreams. This is how we go for 
government control. You got it, baby. 
This bill is moving. Let’s load this up. 
Also, they have provisions in here to 
force employers to give special treat-
ment to Big Labor. That has nothing to 
do with solving this crisis that we face 
right now. It has nothing to do with 
the small business owner figuring out 
if they are going to lay people off or 
they are going to be able to meet pay-
roll. 
Since I have been down here on this 
floor, I have had two phone calls. One 
was from somebody in the hotel busi-
ness and another from somebody with a 
real estate firm saying: Help me. Help 
me with this. Should we lay them off? 
Are you all going to get something 
done? Is this going to be something 
that will help us? 
Another of her dreams is early vot-
ing. She wants to have early voting 
and day-of voting. Yes. Let’s pack the 
ballot box. Here we go. 
And all these States, by the way— 
California, Illinois, New York—States 
that 
cannot 
manage 
their 
affairs; 
States that are running up their State 
income tax; States that have more debt 
than revenue—come on, let’s bail them 
out. This is the vehicle. We can go 
ahead and help these blue States. Send 
them the money because they have 
been reckless with the taxpayers’ dol-
lar. Bail them out. 
New emission standards for the air-
lines. Let me tell you something. 
Wanting to make the airline industry 
carbon neutral by 2025 is a debate to 
have another day. I want to tell you 
something right now. You have heard 
people talk about being the only person 
on the plane or 1 of 14 on the plane, 1 
of 5 on the plane. Right now, keeping 
the planes flying is the issue because 
until we have answers for this health 
crisis, people are not going to go back 
to work and planes are not going to fly. 
Common sense would go a long way in 
these discussions. 
They also want to micromanage cor-
porate boards. They want total and 
complete 
student 
loan 
forgiveness. 
They wanted $20 billion to bail out the 
Postal Service. I could go on and on. 
It is the socialist progressive wish 
list. Throw it all out there and then 
blame it on us when they don’t get it. 
Try to force some of it onto the bill. 
There were Democratic Senators that 
helped to negotiate this bill. They got 
many provisions in this bill that they 
wanted. 
I didn’t get everything I wanted. I 
thought, my goodness, I prefer to see 
that we would refund all of the income 
tax you paid this year for individuals 
and businesses. The system is set up, 
and money could be backed out. 
I like the payroll tax holiday. That is 
something that, as a conservative, I 
have supported for quite a while. Why 
should anybody have to pay the Fed-
eral Government for the privilege of 
hiring somebody and why should an 
employee have to pay the Federal Gov-
ernment for the privilege of working? 
It is common sense. 
I also would have liked to have seen 
us use the employment security system 
for getting money to employees. It is 
set up. It is coordinated with the 
States. 
These are all things I would have 
liked to have seen. I knew I wasn’t 
going to get everything I wanted. 
But I will tell you this. When I read 
that there is a letter, a ‘‘Dear Col-
league’’ letter that has gone out in the 
House from Speaker PELOSI, and she 
has boasted that the majority leader 
had to postpone the vote on the motion 
to proceed and thanks to the minority 
leader, they didn’t get the 60 votes re-
quired—I look at that, and I think, 
what kind of joy do you take in that? 
Here was a measure that had bipar-
tisan support in the Senate. It was a 
measure that would bring relief to 
small businesses and to families and to 
friends who are receiving a diagnosis— 
a positive test for COVID–19—and peo-
ple who are worried about how they are 
going to be payrolled this week, work-
ers who are worried if they are going to 
have a job, small business owners who 
are crying inside because they do not 
know what we are going to do. Yet our 
colleagues across the aisle are absent 
from the floor and the colleagues on 
the other side of the Dome have been 
away for 10 days, and they are not of-
fering a rational solution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President: ‘‘This 
is a tremendous opportunity to re-
structure things to fit our vision.’’ 
This is an opportunity to fit our vi-
sion. 
That is a quote—not from some Com-
munist activist leader somewhere in 
the United States, not from some Third 
World general. No, that is from the 
third ranking Democrat in the House 
of Representatives. Let that sink in for 
a minute. 
Read it again: ‘‘This is a tremendous 
opportunity to restructure things to fit 
our vision.’’ 
I thought a bogus impeachment was 
shameful enough but clearly not. Peo-
ple in this country are dying. They are 
dying, literally. People are losing their 
jobs every day, literally. More and 
more people are getting sick every day. 
And that is why Senators rushed back 
here. We rushed back here to pass the 
House bipartisan legislation that was 
negotiated between the President and 
Speaker PELOSI. 
Then we let both sides work on the 
next steps. We passed that bill within 
less than 24 hours of receiving it from 
the House. As imperfect as it was, we 
passed it with 90 Senators voting for it. 
That is how bipartisanship works. We 
worked around the clock to craft a 
plan, and we succeeded. 
Here we sit, listening to our Demo-
cratic colleagues pretend this is a par-
tisan plan, as if they weren’t sitting in 
the room as it was being negotiated, 
and many of their ideas are in this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1955 
March 23, 2020 
Why are they doing that? I will tell 
you why they are doing it. When we see 
a rising body count, they see a political 
opportunity. Shame on them. The 
Trump derangement syndrome is accel-
erating the coronavirus. They should 
be ashamed of themselves. They see a 
chance to impose their vision—their 
leftwing, radical vision on our country 
because they think they can force it 
past us during this crisis. Their ex-
treme partisan obstruction has blinded 
them. 
What has happened to this place? 
Why are they even here? 
Attempts to work across the aisle— 
honest attempts, attempts by rank- 
and-file Republicans and rank-and-file 
Democrats—have 
resulted 
in 
our 
Democratic colleagues having created 
a revisionist view of what we have been 
doing, and it has resulted in blind, po-
litical opportunism just to advance 
their 
extreme 
leftwing 
agenda—an 
agenda that includes things like the 
Green New Deal, which is something 
that actually had a vote on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. Guess how many of 
them voted for it—none. It was that 
nutty—none. Yet, now, that is the 
agenda. That is their vision. That is 
the opportunity they see. 
How about socialism for the entire 
economy? It was not enough just for 
the energy sector. It was not enough 
just for the healthcare sector. It was 
not enough just for the manufacturing 
sector. Let’s just have socialism. Let’s 
debate which Democratic Presidential 
candidate is the best Socialist. How 
about hurting our farmers, our ranch-
ers, our oil workers, our truckdrivers, 
our restaurant owners, our manufac-
turers, or our welders—everybody? 
We are not even asking them to vote 
on this plan. The vote last night was 
not on the bill, and the vote this after-
noon was not on the bill. It was simply 
a procedural vote to begin the debate, 
to continue the negotiations on the 
bill. Not one moment would have been 
lost. Guess what. Now over a day has 
been lost while we have dithered. We 
are asking—when we do finally agree 
to help the American people—that in-
stead of killing the economy and the 
jobs, as they have been doing, that we 
be ready to act on the bill. No, that is 
not good enough for them. 
Many of my colleagues have talked 
about what is in the bill. There is $4 
billion for the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. Do you think it 
could use it? 
How about $9 billion for child nutri-
tion? Do you care, Democrats, about 
child nutrition? We have often heard 
you talk about it. Where is it now? 
How about $20 billion for veterans? 
Do they not care about that? 
How about $50 billion for our farm-
ers? I spoke about it. How about $75 bil-
lion for our healthcare providers? Do 
you think your healthcare providers 
could use a little more assistance, 
Democrats? I think they could, and 
they need it now. They needed it yes-
terday. 
How about $350 billion for the small 
businesses that employ all of those 
people who are now getting fired be-
cause they can’t keep their doors open? 
Yet that is not even worth a debate to 
our Democratic colleagues. Oh, no. 
Apparently, it is now all back open 
for debate. The reports today are that 
the minority leader is holding the $50 
billion for farmers hostage so they can 
get more of the opportunity to restruc-
ture things to fit their vision. 
Apparently, the majority leader ei-
ther forgot or he never knew that food 
doesn’t come from the deli. 
Mr. Minority Leader, food comes 
from the farmer. There is no sandwich 
in the New York deli without the farm-
ers’ growing the grain. There is no 
meat in that sandwich without the 
ranchers’ raising the livestock. No, 
they don’t make that food in the deli, 
Mr. Minority Leader. 
Who started all of this? It was not he. 
He tried to be helpful for a while or at 
least it appeared so. No, it was not he. 
It was not even an uprising of the 
rank-and-file Democrats who have been 
filing in, occasionally, into this Cham-
ber. It wasn’t even the breakdown in 
negotiations between the Republicans 
and the Democrats. It was the House 
Speaker, NANCY PELOSI, who flew in 
here on an airplane that was powered 
by fossil fuels. Maybe those fossil fuels 
were even made by some oil from Alas-
ka or North Dakota or Texas. She de-
manded an expansion of—what?—the 
renewable energy tax credits and other 
parts of her extreme leftwing, radical, 
partisan agenda. 
What in the hell does that have to do 
with the coronavirus? 
The absurdity of it speaks for itself. 
That is what we have learned to expect 
from the majority of our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and in the 
other Chamber of Congress—ever since 
the freshman Democrat from New York 
became the de facto Speaker of the 
House. That is the House. We are not 
the House. We are the Senate. We are 
supposed to be the adults in the room. 
Some of our colleagues are here, acting 
like petulant children when there are 
people who are suffering and who don’t 
know what to do or where to turn for 
help. They are turning to us. We are it. 
We are the help. We are driving the am-
bulance. All the while, the Speaker of 
the House tries to steer us into the 
ditch while the minority leader of the 
Senate hangs on for dear life in the 
passenger’s seat. 
Why would those people come to us 
for help anymore? The House Speaker 
doesn’t care about them. For crying 
out loud, she cares about renewable 
fuel tax credits. Where is rural Amer-
ica supposed to go? The Democratic 
leader sees them as, simply, political 
pawns. Being held hostage is $50 billion 
for farmers. Let’s hold that one up. 
Maybe we could get more of what fits 
our vision, our radical agenda. 
Apparently, 
helping 
these 
people 
doesn’t matter to them. Well, I have 
news for him. I have news for the mi-
nority leader. While the Democrats 
dither, Americans are dying. That is a 
real fact. Let’s get back in here to-
night, and let’s pass this legislation. 
Let’s get it done and get the money to 
the people who need it the most. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, once 
again, I stood at this podium yesterday 
and called on the Senate to put politics 
aside and deliver critical relief to the 
American people, many of whom are on 
the frontlines of this war. Yet CHUCK 
SCHUMER
and the Senate Democrats 
have turned their backs on them, hav-
ing been encouraged by NANCY PELOSI. 
People are getting sick. They are 
worried about their families. They are 
losing their jobs. Schools are closed. 
Small businesses are days away from 
shutting their doors, and hospitals are 
running out of equipment, cash, and 
room. Doctors and nurses are working 
around the clock, and they are our first 
line of defense. People are suffering. 
A hospital in Tifton, GA, faces such 
severe equipment shortages that it is 
forced to wear trash bags as protection. 
Many rural hospitals in Georgia only 
have days of operating cash left. Also, 
in rural Georgia, children go to the bus 
stops to pick up their local papers. 
That is their education for the day 
while their schools are closed. 
In Cartersville, GA, Table 20 was 
forced to lay off nearly all of its staff 
just to remain open, like too many oth-
ers. 
In Athens, GA, the virus has turned a 
college town into a ghost town, and the 
virus is devastating its economy, like 
too many others. 
All over the State, waiters, wait-
resses, car salesmen, mechanics, farm-
ers, and shopkeepers wonder: How will 
I possibly care for my family? 
For the last 2 weeks, I have been con-
tinuously talking with the people of 
Georgia: with cancer patients whose 
procedures have been canceled; with 
families whose entire livelihoods have 
been wiped out; with people in busi-
nesses who can’t pay the rent, the 
mortgage, the car payment, get gro-
ceries, or get lifesaving tests and pro-
cedures; and with families who have 
been forced to cancel weddings and fu-
nerals. 
While the effects of this disease tear 
through our country, thousands of 
Americans are infected, and millions 
face layoffs. They are fighting with all 
they have. Yet what are SCHUMER and 
PELOSI doing? Nothing. The Democrats 
continue to politicize this rescue. How 
many people must be hurt for them to 
leave their selfish partisanship behind 
and get relief to our fellow Americans? 
While the rest of America comes to-
gether, like the Savannah Salvation 
Army that holds church services out-
side or like Meals on Wheels that deliv-
ers meals to seniors, the Democrats are 
playing games and holding hostage des-
perately needed relief. America does 
not deserve this. NANCY

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1956 
March 23, 2020 
CHUCK SCHUMER are putting solar pan-
els ahead of people. Meanwhile, Presi-
dent Trump and his administration are 
working around the clock to address 
this crisis while the Democrats are 
continuing the resistance. 
I know the folks at home see it for 
what it is—politicians who will not 
miss their own paychecks or their own 
benefits or who will not miss their 
home payments or their car payments. 
They are safely tucked away behind 
their coffee carts in their offices and 
are taking advantage of the moment— 
pushing ideas that could never pass in 
Congress. 
A bipartisan bill was ready to go this 
weekend. This delay is entirely on 
their backs. It is the worst of Wash-
ington, and it is disgusting. The Amer-
ican people must hold the Democrats 
to account. I will keep fighting for 
Georgians and all Americans with my 
colleagues, and I will not leave here 
until our work is done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 24 
hours ago, we thought we would have 
this legislation passed and that it 
would be on its way to the House of 
Representatives and, soon this week, 
on its way to the President for his sig-
nature so we could respond to the crisis 
we are in. This legislation about which 
you have heard several speeches to-
night is the answer to the crisis—the 
economic crisis—just like two other 
pieces of legislation we passed in the 
last 2 weeks that were signed by the 
President and that responded to the 
public health crisis. 
America is suffering. I don’t have to 
tell you the stories of personal hard-
ship and the loss—particularly eco-
nomic but now real life loss—because 
of this virus. This serious health crisis 
is quickly becoming a serious economic 
crisis. Through no fault of their own, 
Americans have been sidelined to fight 
the virus, and the economy is unravel-
ing as a result of the public health cri-
sis. Every hour, more people are being 
laid off. Every hour, more businesses 
are closing their doors. Every hour, 
families are being forced to figure out 
how they are going to pay their bills. 
Without a doubt, this is a crisis. Hun-
dreds of thousands of people this week 
are going to the unemployment office, 
but you wouldn’t know it by watching 
the Senate Democrats as they drag 
their feet on much needed relief for 
Americans. It is not just for Ameri-
cans; it is to get the entire economy 
moving. 
So how has this evolved to the point 
that it has now? 
No. 1, last night and not once today 
but twice today—so three times—we 
tried to get this bill up on the U.S. 
Senate floor just for debate. We have 
been filibustered on procedural votes 
just to allow us to debate this relief 
package. It is a package that we have 
been working on in a bipartisan way 
for several days now. 
This sort of activity by the Demo-
cratic Senators is outrageous. They are 
blocking a bill that includes relief that 
we all agree is needed for the American 
people. They say this wasn’t a bipar-
tisan effort. That is what we have 
heard all day. Really? Well, I have had 
very good working relationships, very 
good dialogue, and some disagreement 
but a coming together with several of 
my Democratic colleague on the Com-
mittee on Finance in meetings on Fri-
day and Saturday to work out a bipar-
tisan bill that we could be voting on 
now. So they say it was not a bipar-
tisan effort. Really? Then who were all 
of those people who were sitting in the 
same room I was, negotiating around 
the clock for multiple days? 
The fact is, we have worked with the 
Democrats on this bill, and we have 
worked in good faith together—both 
sides. We have included many provi-
sions the Democrats want because we 
started with what the Republicans 
thought was a good bill in order to 
solve these economic problems. We had 
to change some Republican issues, and 
we had to add some Democratic issues. 
In fact, they don’t want to admit it of 
the legislation, but many of my col-
leagues on the other side, on just this 
very day, have come to the Senate 
floor to brag about the areas on which 
we agree. These are provisions in this 
bill. But in the same breath, they call 
this a partisan bill. That makes no 
sense. Why would they want to say 
that a bill that we worked on for sev-
eral days, working out differences be-
tween Democrats and Republicans, is a 
partisan bill? 
They also claim that this bill con-
tains so-called corporate bailouts and 
not enough funding for workers and 
healthcare providers. 
Well, let me say that loaning money 
to small business and big business that 
has to be paid back—in the case of 
small business under this bill, I have to 
admit that if they have fewer than 500 
employees and they get benefit from it 
and they don’t lay anybody off, it will 
be a forgiven loan. But for really large 
corporations—let’s say like getting the 
airlines flying again because the public 
depends on them and because there are 
millions of jobs connected with the air-
lines—giving them loans is a bailout? 
No, it is not. It is a jobs bill so those 
millions of people working for the air-
lines can continue to work and the fly-
ing public can fly when they want to 
fly. 
That is my response to the fact that 
this is not a corporate bailout like 
they want you to believe. 
And no help for individuals? Let’s 
look at the facts for helping individ-
uals. 
This bill would send $1,200 to almost 
every American immediately; couples, 
$2,400; and families would get $500 for 
each child. It is meant that this money 
would be out to these families who 
need this help just as fast as the IRS 
can get it out. And it is no different 
from what we did in 2008 with the great 
recession that we were going into at 
that particular time. 
This bill also responds to what Demo-
crats asked us to do: Beef up the unem-
ployment insurance program, bene-
fiting those people laid off. 
Now, all 50 States have a different 
figure for what unemployment pays un-
employed people in that particular 
State. But whatever that figure is, our 
bill would add $600 per week for a pe-
riod of 3 months. And if somebody says 
‘‘Well, that is not long enough,’’ well, 
if we don’t get this economy turned 
around in 3 months, we are going to be 
here doing it all again anyway. 
But it beefs up the unemployment by 
$600 in each of those States on top of 
what those States are already paying 
out. The unemployment part of this 
bill 
makes 
unemployment 
benefits 
available to more Americans than ever 
before. 
Now, I am chairman of the Finance 
Committee. These are just the provi-
sions in the Finance Committee bill. 
There were three other bipartisan 
groups of people working on other 
parts of the economy to get this bill 
put together to help unemployed peo-
ple. 
Our bill, though, in the Finance Com-
mittee also includes assistance for 
businesses of all sizes. It keeps them 
afloat so that folks have a job to go 
back to when they come out of this 
pandemic. So don’t try to say that this 
bill doesn’t help workers. 
The bill also includes about $100 bil-
lion for healthcare workers and helps 
to speed up delivery of treatments and 
helps to get potential vaccines devel-
oped a lot faster. This bill also helps 
health professionals. 
But it helps nobody—nobody gets any 
help—as long as the Congress sits on 
its thumb, and that is what we have 
been doing all day, when this bill could 
have been passed and sent to the 
House. 
My colleagues complain that this un-
precedented aid package is not suffi-
cient. I don’t know what the exact fig-
ure is at this point because there are 
still some negotiations going on, but 
the last I heard it was fast approaching 
$2 trillion. Somehow, that is not 
enough. 
They are saying it is not enough 
help. So while they are saying it is not 
enough help, nobody is getting any 
help. I don’t understand it. 
As I have already alluded to, we 
passed phase 1 legislation to help 2 
weeks ago; we passed phase 2 last week; 
we are working on phase 3. So if we 
need more help down the road, we will 
have that opportunity when we know 
for sure what the situation is. We don’t 
have to address the next 10 years in 
what they are trying to negotiate now. 
We can address these problems if we 
don’t get the pandemic under control 
by then. 
So there is no excuse for not deliv-
ering what we can do this very day. In-
stead, the Democrats are playing poli-
tics while the rest of the country suf-
fers, while there is great anxiety out

there, while they are looking to their 
leaders for help and not getting it. 
If you don’t think this is political, 
just look at the political wish list that 
PELOSI has put out. The scholar of the 
U.S. Senate, Senator SASSE, is going to 
speak about that, I think, coming up 
here, and you will see a picture of this 
great big bill that she put forward. But 
just let me name two or three things 
that I know about because I haven’t 
read an 1,100-page bill like he probably 
has. 
They want to erase the Postal Serv-
ice debt. What does that have to do 
with hundreds of thousands of people 
going to the unemployment office 
today? 
They want to require same-day voter 
registration. What does voter registra-
tion have to do with the crisis of unem-
ployment and the pandemic that we 
are facing today? 
They want to saddle the airlines with 
crippling 
new 
emission 
standards. 
What does that have to do with the un-
employed today, the people who are 
suffering, the anxiety that is out there 
that people have because they don’t 
know how bad this situation is and 
they know they are losing their job? 
This legislation also wants to resur-
rect the Green New Deal at the same 
time families are losing their income. 
My colleagues, now is just not the 
time for this sort of horseplay. There 
will be plenty of opportunities to de-
bate these policies later, not when we 
have a crisis on our hands—in other 
words, not now. 
Just a few days ago, our bipartisan 
talks were going very well. We made 
incredible progress over the course of 
the few days that we put this together, 
so we have a bipartisan bill. 
So to my Democratic colleagues, 
please put your swords away. Please 
focus on the task at hand. Please stop 
the delaying tactics and the poli-
ticking. America needs us to deliver. 
Now is not the time for more foot-drag-
ging and procedural delays. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, my chair-
man on the Finance Committee, Chair-
man GRASSLEY, who just left the floor, 
called me a scholar, and I think he 
meant it as a compliment, but it 
doesn’t feel like that today. 
It actually feels like the fact that I 
have been reading this this afternoon is 
a sign of the fact that this institution 
is broken in significant ways, and there 
are not a lot of productive things hap-
pening outside a group of four people 
who are renegotiating a car deal again 
and again and again and again. 
I did spend a good chunk of my after-
noon reading these 1,119 pages. You 
might wonder what this is. This is 
NANCY PELOSI’s last-minute additional 
Christmas wish list of progressive 
items that she wants added to the 
coronavirus relief bill that has been 
being negotiated here over the course 
of the last 96 or so hours. 
I wanted to read this because I think 
we owe it to our constituents to know 
what is in bills before people pass 
them. And I want to say, in full disclo-
sure, the wish list keeps growing so 
rapidly and radically that this thing 
could be like 50 percent obsolete since 
3 or 4 hours ago when I started digging 
into it. There may be another bill that 
is another 1,200 pages thick. 
But this is the one that I have been 
reading today, and the Speaker has ob-
viously decided that she doesn’t want 
to waste any crisis. 
The American people face two un-
precedented emergencies. We face a 
public health emergency that is genu-
inely disastrous, and we face a con-
sequent resultant economic emergency 
that puts at risk lots and lots of fami-
lies’ livelihoods, lots of dinner tables 
around the country. 
There are 5,997,000 firms in the 
United States—so just a hair shy of 6 
million firms in the United States. And 
lots and lots and lots of those—the 
overwhelming majority of firms—and 
47 percent of all employment are small 
businesses in America. These are firms 
of 500 or fewer employees. These are 
family businesses. These are corner 
stores. Lots and lots and lots of these 
people live on an average—their busi-
nesses live on an average—of 16 days of 
cash. 
So when the country is shut down in 
the 
midst 
of 
something 
like 
the 
coronavirus crisis, there are lots of 
businesses that have only about 2 
weeks before they may cease to exist 
and just go poof or go down some other 
pathway that leads them to become de-
pendencies of the State. 
So we have two massive crises in this 
country—one public health and one 
economic. And this place often lies and 
pretends that there is some piece of 
legislation that can solve every prob-
lem on Earth. That isn’t true, but in 
this case, both of these emergencies 
need lots and lots of help and bandaids 
and salve and lifelines, life preservers 
from this institution, and that is why 
so many people around here have been 
working all night overnight 3 or 4 days 
in a row. 
A number of us have been in this 
Chamber until midnight or 1 a.m. mul-
tiple nights. I am a 4 a.m. wake-up guy, 
so I am usually in bed by 9 p.m. When 
I am here at midnight or 1 a.m., it is 
well past a period of coherence. So 
when we are working around the clock, 
it is because there is an emergency. 
Lots and lots and lots of stuff in this 
1,119-page additional bid from NANCY 
PELOSI have nothing to do with the 
coronavirus emergency. 
So I want to take us through some of 
what is in this piece of legislation, but 
I am going to pull up for a minute as I 
recognize that the majority leader, 
who is at the center of this negotia-
tion, has entered the Chamber. So I am 
going to yield to him and let him make 
whatever updates he wants to give us 
in this Chamber, and then I will return 
to this piece of legislation after the 
majority leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
say to my friend from Nebraska that I 
will be very brief. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
send a cloture motion to the desk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clo-
ture motion having been presented 
under rule XXII, the Chair directs the 
clerk to read the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the mo-
tion to proceed to Calendar No. 157, H.R. 748, 
a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 to repeal the excise tax on high cost em-
ployer-sponsored health coverage. 
Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, Pat 
Roberts, Ben Sasse, Deb Fischer, Cindy 
Hyde-Smith, John Hoeven, Tom Cot-
ton, James E. Risch, Lamar Alexander, 
Bill Cassidy, David Perdue, Marco 
Rubio, John Cornyn, Thom Tillis, 
Steve Daines, Michael B. Enzi. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the mandatory quorum 
call for the cloture motion be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, just 
one further observation, we will not be 
having any votes tonight. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I want to 
be clear. This negotiation has been 
messy. There is lots and lots in this 
bill that I don’t like. There is lots in 
this bill that is also critically impor-
tant and urgent for the American peo-
ple. 
There are a bunch of things in here 
that I think stink. I don’t like firm- 
specific money in legislation. So I 
don’t like much of the airlines section 
of this bill. The airlines didn’t do any-
thing wrong at this moment when all 
their travelers fall off because of the 
pandemic before them, but there are 
pieces of the way any legislation like 
this is written, when it has specific 
firms in it, that I dislike and I think 
should be done more effectively over 
time. But this is following a model of 
how these portions of legislation have 
been written around here in the past. 
I don’t like the direct payments that 
Washington is going to try to renew 
long after the American people have 
defeated the coronavirus. There is a lot 
in this legislation that I don’t like. 
But there are things we should all be 
applauding. This legislation tries to 
turbocharge vaccine development. We 
need what our friend, the Senator from 
Montana, called the Manhattan Project 
for the vaccine accelerator. We need to 
go lots faster figuring out how to re-
move barriers to enable companies at 
this time that seek to be effective over 
efficient in ways that pluralize lots and 
lots of pharmaceutical firms competing 
all at once and taking three or four 
steps of the vaccine development proc-
ess and trying to run them in parallel

S1958 
March 23, 2020 
instead of in sequence, because the 
American people and the world need 
this vaccine. There are things to be 
proud of in that part of the legislation. 
I like the fact that this legislation— 
not the Pelosi legislation, but the com-
posite compromise bill that the Senate 
has been working on over the last four 
days—tries to help small businesses 
stay alive during this period of zero 
revenue with well-structured loans. I 
think that Senators RUBIO and COLLINS 
and their two Democratic colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle have done 
a really good job. It is a crazy, eye-pop-
ping pricetag at about $350 billion, this 
small business loan program, but it is a 
necessity at this moment, and it is leg-
islation that people should be proud of. 
I like the fact that this bill works in 
the appropriations section—not the 
whole bill, not the whole draft text, as 
I wish it would. But in the appropria-
tions section, it works hard to get 
more than 51 percent of the appropria-
tions section of the money to Gov-
ernors to allow them to make differen-
tiated spending decisions, which they 
can make more effectively than we can 
make in Washington, DC, where we 
look out across 325 million people in an 
undifferentiated way. Our Governors 
are better at building public-private 
partnerships than the Congress is. 
In my State, Omaha and Lincoln 
have different economics than the 
rural parts of the State, but Omaha 
and Lincoln are different than Nash-
ville and Memphis. And National and 
Memphis are different than L.A. and 
Seattle. So this bill works hard to try 
to take a big chunk—a majority of the 
appropriations section of the legisla-
tion—and drive it back to Governors. 
There are things that are good in this 
bill. There are things that I think are 
weak and clunky in this bill, but it was 
negotiated in a bipartisan way in good 
faith on topics and issues that were re-
lated to the coronavirus emergency. It 
wasn’t a Republican bill. It wasn’t a 
Democratic bill. It certainly isn’t my 
favorite bill or piece of legislation 
around here, but it was a good-faith, 
bipartisan attempt that people were 
negotiating on all weekend. 
But, instead of taking that legisla-
tion—urgent, necessary legislation— 
and passing it quickly, Democrats have 
now decided to allow Speaker PELOSI 
to block it through proxies here in the 
Senate so she can rewrite the bill with 
a ton of crap that has absolutely noth-
ing to do with the public health emer-
gency that we face at this moment. 
So I have been reading the legislation 
this afternoon. We have families suf-
fering and small businesses that are 
closing literally by the hour. We have 
doctors fighting to prevent their hos-
pitals from being oversurged and over-
whelmed, and what is Speaker PELOSI 
trying to do? She is trying to take hos-
tages about her dream legislation—all 
sorts of dream legislative provisions 
that have nothing to do with this mo-
ment—and say: The American public 
can’t get access to the public health 
piece of legislation or the economic re-
lief pieces of legislation unless she gets 
hostages that are entirely unrelated to 
this moment. 
We are better than that. Democrats 
in the Senate are better than that. 
Many of them are privately embar-
rassed about this. I don’t understand 
how they voted today to filibuster this 
bill for a second time when in private 
many of them tell us: Well, this is just 
part of the negotiation and our leaders 
want us to vote this way, but I am real-
ly uncomfortable with it because I 
don’t think we should be dealing with 
unrelated issues. 
I had multiple Democrats today tell 
me they don’t think they should be 
dealing with unrelated issues, things 
that are not about the health and eco-
nomic emergencies before the Nation. 
Here is why we stopped. Here is why 
the bill that is before us, again, is not 
my favorite piece of legislation—not 
Republicans, not Democrats—but a bi-
partisan, good-faith piece of legisla-
tion. The reason we are not voting on 
it is because 1,119 pages of new NANCY 
PELOSI demands that we should con-
sider. 
I promise you that every Wash-
ington, DC, lobbyist right now has been 
combing over these 1,200 pages this 
afternoon because they wonder what 
goodies they can claim credit for or 
what goodies that are against their 
sector they should go against. 
We shouldn’t be debating anything in 
an emergency moment like this with 
another 1,119 pages being dropped in at 
the last minute with other demands. 
So I decided to start digging through 
it. 
Let me give you a few highlights—or 
low lights. Here is page 421, line 22: 
(1) MINIMUM STUDENT LOAN RELIEF 
AS A RESULT OF THE COVID–19 NA-
TIONAL EMERGENCY.—Not later than 270 
days after the last day of the COVID–19 
emergency period. . . . 
Think about what this means. Not 
later than 270 days—that is 9 months 
after the emergency is over. Then the 
Secretary of Education has to do all 
this new stuff. 
Nobody who wants student debt loan 
forgiveness 
should 
pretend 
this 
is 
about getting emergency cash into the 
economy for liquidity or solvency, be-
cause the NANCY PELOSI demand about 
loan forgiveness says here that this is 
for something 9 months after the emer-
gency. 
This is something that many Demo-
crats want. As a former college presi-
dent, I actually think this is a bad 
idea, but there are intellectually defen-
sible reasons to argue for it. There are 
reasonable cases to be made, but they 
have tried to make them in the past 
and not been able to pass the legisla-
tion, and it has nothing to do with the 
coronavirus. 
Not later than 270 days after the last day 
of the COVID–19 emergency period, the Sec-
retaries concerned shall jointly carry out a 
program under which a qualified borrower, 
with respect to the covered loans and private 
education of loans of such qualified bor-
rower, shall receive in accordance with para-
graph (3) an amount equal to the lesser of 
the following: 
(A) The total amount of each covered loan 
and each private education loan of the bor-
rower; or 
(B) $10,000. 
So what this says is you can feel the 
Bern with a $10,000 public and private 
loan cancellation project a year in the 
future, or depending on how long this 
emergency goes, this emergency could 
be with us through a trough in the late 
summer and another peak in the fall 
and winter. We may be in the emer-
gency for more than a year. So Speaker 
PELOSI says: Well, the Cabinet officials 
in the executive branch shouldn’t prob-
ably be burdened with this now because 
it obviously has nothing to do with the 
coronavirus, but in the future we want 
to bake into law a $10,000 loan forgive-
ness program that has nothing to do 
with coronavirus. 
That is wrong. This institution has 
been bleeding public trust for a long 
time. When we pass a $2 trillion piece 
of legislation in the middle of an emer-
gency, there are going to be lots of 
things wrong with it. There are going 
to be lots of reasons why the public 
looks back and says: Why aren’t you 
all more competent? Why couldn’t you 
have done this better? Why wouldn’t 
you have done that better? Boy, this 
feels clunky. Why would these people 
be included in the direct payments, but 
those people wouldn’t? You have to 
earn $2,500, but we are using the 2018 
tax returns to be able to determine 
whether or not you earned your $2,500 
to be able to qualify for the $1,200 per 
family, and it phases out from 75 to 
$95,000? There are a lot of hard-policy, 
mechanical, technical issues that need 
to be navigated, and some of them will 
be imperfect. 
And later, the public will say: Why 
did you do it this way instead of this 
way? And those will be fair questions. 
We will have to defend the members of 
the task forces who wrote that part of 
the legislation—a bipartisan task force 
that worked on that piece of legisla-
tion all weekend. 
But what will be completely impos-
sible is to tell the public: Well, the rea-
son we did the loan forgiveness pro-
gram, which had nothing to do with 
coronavirus, this way rather than that 
way was because—why?—because it 
was a northbound train and people 
could load it with a whole bunch of 
swampy stuff. 
You may believe in loan forgiveness. 
Make the case and win an argument for 
loan forgiveness. Don’t do it on the 
backs of a national emergency, when in 
Nebraska I have families calling me 
from Omaha where spouses have just 
been put in new institutions in the last 
2 or 3 weeks because of declining de-
mentia, because of Alzheimer’s. And as 
soon as they got put in an institution, 
that institution got put on a quar-
antine lockdown, and a husband is only 
in his late sixties, but he is losing his 
entire mind and memory. He doesn’t

understand why he is there, and his 
wife and kids can’t visit him anymore, 
and he doesn’t know what the heck is 
going on. 
That is a genuine tragedy. That is 
not an occasion for NANCY PELOSI to 
try to get a loan forgiveness program 
done that she couldn’t get done by reg-
ular legislation. It is wrong, and the 
Democrats in this body, most of them, 
know it is wrong. None of them are 
going to come down here and make an 
argument. None of the 47 Democrats in 
the Senate are going to come to the 
floor of the Senate and say: You know 
what we ought to do during this na-
tional emergency? We ought to do a 
student loan forgiveness program right 
now. 
Someone might mention it in a long 
list, implying that the program may 
have to do with liquidity. But if you 
actually read what happens in the leg-
islation, there is no loan forgiveness 
until 270 days after the coronavirus na-
tional emergency is over. 
Page 570. Not even a coronavirus can 
put a pause on our culture wars. Line 
14: 
The Congressional COVID–19 Aid Oversight 
Panel in conjunction with SIGTARP— 
I don’t know what that acronym 
means— 
shall collect diversity data from any cor-
poration that receives Federal aid related to 
COVID–19, and issue a report that will be 
made publicly available no later than one 
year after the disbursement of funds. In addi-
tion to any other data, the report shall in-
clude the following: 
(1) 
EMPLOYEE 
DEMOGRAPHICS.—The 
gender, race, and ethnic identity (and to the 
extent possible, results disaggregated by eth-
nic group) of [all] the corporation’s employ-
ees, as otherwise known or provided volun-
tarily for the total number of employees 
(full- and part-time). . . . 
I am just going to skip ahead a cou-
ple of paragraphs. 
(3) PAY EQUITY.—A comparison of pay 
amongst racial and ethnic minorities (and to 
the extent possible, results disaggregated by 
ethnic group) as compared to their white 
counterparts and a comparison of pay be-
tween men and women for similar roles and 
assignments. 
(4) CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY.— 
Corporate board demographic data, including 
total number of board members, gender, race 
and ethnic identity of board members. . . . 
Et cetera, et cetera—I am skipping 
ahead here. 
Page 572, the next page: 
(e) DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF-
FICES.—Any corporation that receives Fed-
eral aid related to COVID–19 must maintain 
officials and budget dedicated to diversity 
and inclusion initiatives for no less than 5 
years after. . . . 
Blah, blah, blah—none of this has 
anything to do with the coronavirus. 
There are all sorts of real racial issues 
in America that need to be addressed, 
but none of this has anything to do 
with the coronavirus. If you want to 
argue for this legislation, argue for 
this legislation once people in nursing 
homes in Nebraska aren’t being locked 
out of being able to visit their family 
members with Alzheimer’s and demen-
tia.

‘‘SEC. 325. SAME DAY REGISTRATION.

‘‘(2) 
EXCEPTION.—The 
requirements 
under paragraph (1) shall not apply to a 
State in which, under a State law in effect 
continuously on or after the date of the en-
actment of this section. . . . 
You see, what this is about is same- 
day voter registration, because Novem-
ber 3 is just 225 days away, and if there 
is anything the American people are 
worried right now about, it is that they 
would like Washington, DC, to take 
away the authority of 50 secretaries of 
State and determine how you conduct 
local elections in America. 
This has absolutely nothing to do 
with coronavirus—absolutely nothing 
to do with coronavirus. This isn’t a Re-
publican v. Democratic scream. This is 
nonsense. This is where 99 percent of 
the American public, if they were in 
this Gallery, would be shaking their 
head and rolling their eyes and saying: 
What? You guys are trying to decide 
that the Federal Government should, 
for the first time in U.S. history, 
change the way local elections are con-
ducted by Secretaries of State in 
America? By the way, there is no one 
in the Gallery for a reason—because 
the Gallery is shut down because we 
are in the middle of a pandemic. 
So this probably isn’t the time to be 
having a debate about whether the 
Federal 
Government 
should 
micro-
manage the way our 50 States conduct 
their elections. I think this is a bad 
idea. But if you want to argue for this 
idea, let’s do it as soon as the pandemic 
is over. Come and actually make an ar-
gument. Quit trying to exploit the cri-
sis. 
Page 725—there is almost no section 
of American life for government that 
can’t be touched in an emergency if 
you want to play exploited politics.

Because, of course, in the middle of a 
pandemic, do you know what the 
American people want? They want to 
have a labor fight about the Postal 
Service.

BORROWING 
AU-
THORITY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law— 
(1) any outstanding debt of the United 
States Postal Service owed to the Treasury 
pursuant to sections 2005 and 2011 of title 5, 
United States Code, on the date of the enact-
ment of this Act is hereby canceled; and 
(2) after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the United States Postal Service is au-
thorized to borrow money from the Treasury 
in an amount not to exceed— 
I have got to count all these num-
bers— 
$15,000,000,000 to carry out the duties and 
responsibilities of the Postal Service, includ-
ing those under title 39, United States Code, 
and the Secretary of the Treasury shall lend 
up to such amount at the request of the 
Postal Service. 
(b) REPEAL OF FISCAL YEAR BOR-
ROWING LIMIT.—Section 2005(a)(1) of title 
39, United States Code, is amended by strik-
ing ‘‘In any one fiscal year,’’ and all that fol-
lows through the period. 
Please, Senate Democrats, you don’t 
believe that this is good governance. 
Somebody please come to the floor and 
defend why we are doing a Postal Serv-
ice bailout in the middle of an emer-
gency. 
I know that BERNIE SANDERS believes 
in Postal Service reform. I don’t agree 
with Senator SANDERS on this, but he 
is actually pretty thoughtful about it. 
He spent a lot of time thinking about 
how you might bail out the Postal 
Service. So if BERNIE SANDERS wants to 
argue for a Postal Service bailout, he 
should make that case. I haven’t been 
here all day, but I have presided a cou-
ple of hours. I haven’t heard a single 
Democrat come to the floor and argue 
for a Postal Service bailout. 
Somebody please come back to the 
floor and at least stand in the light of 
day before the American people and 
say the stuff NANCY PELOSI is voting 
for you think is a good idea to do in 
the middle of this national health 
emergency. 
Page 768, line 7: 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, subject to the re-
quirements of this subsection, the wage rate 
in effect under section (a)(1) with respect to 
an employee of an employer described in 
paragraph (2), or any individual who provides 
labor or services for remuneration for such 
employer, regardless of whether the indi-
vidual is classified as an independent con-
tractor or otherwise by such employer, shall 
be not less than $15.00 per hour. 
So while businesses are struggling to 
make ends meet—and we are seeing 
lots and lots of small businesses go 
bankrupt in all 50 States in America 
today. Businesses are going bankrupt 
in America today in all 50 of the States 
that we represent. Speaker PELOSI 
wants to raise the minimum wage to 
$15 an hour. 
I used to be a professor. I am a busi-
ness guy by background, but I was a 
history professor for a long time, and 
when I would teach, I taught the So-
cratic method when I taught a sem-
inar. In a lecture class, it is different, 
but in a seminar, if I had 12 students or 
I had 15 students in a class, I would 
regularly try to frame up a given week-
ly seminar, and I would try to figure 
out how to map a debate where you 
could get about half the people in the 
class on each side of a debate. 
If it ended up that the debate was off- 
weighted and there was a minority 
group and a majority group, I would 
tend to join the minority group, re-
gardless of what was the issue, and I 
would try to fight for the minority po-
sition just to help spice up the debate 
and make it more interesting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1960 
March 23, 2020 
I think a $15 minimum wage is really 
bad economics, but I have argued for it 
many, many times in class because 
there are intellectually coherent rea-
sons to argue for it. I don’t think it 
works. And if we weren’t dealing with 
the pandemic in King County, WA, one 
of the things we might talk about in 
this body is how the $15 minimum wage 
has worked out in Seattle. Their public 
was overwhelmingly in favor of it a 
couple of years ago, and now there is a 
huge move against it because people 
realized what a $15 minimum wage ac-
tually 
does. 
It 
accelerates 
the 
marginalization and the capitalization 
and the layoffs of people making be-
tween $9 and $14 an hour. That is what 
it actually does. It speeds automation. 
So I would love it if anybody who was 
a primary breadwinner in the house 
was earning way more than $15 an 
hour. I would love that to be reality in 
American life. But here are two facts 
you need to know. 
Fact No. 1, last time I checked the 
data, 89 percent of everybody who made 
the minimum wage in America wasn’t 
a primary wage earner. They were a 
high school kid; they were a college 
student getting their first job; they 
were working part time while they 
were in school; or they just graduated 
high school, and they hadn’t figured 
out their long-term path. Maybe they 
were in trade school, but they were 
working a minimum-wage job and still 
lived at mom and dad’s house or maybe 
they were a 65-year-old aunt who lived 
with a family that the rest of the house 
was self-sufficient, but her wages aug-
mented the family’s income. Eighty- 
nine percent of the people who make 
the minimum wage in America are not 
the primary wage earner or bread-
winner in their family, but of the 11 
percent who are, the idea that you can 
just raise the minimum wage to any 
amount—I mean, if you just think good 
intentions are sufficient, then why $15? 
For heaven’s sake, $15 an hour on a 
2,000-hour work year, 40 hours a week 
times 50 weeks, that makes $30,000 
year. It is really hard to get by on 
$30,000 a year. If you think good inten-
tions are enough, $15 isn’t enough. Why 
not have a minimum wage of $25? Why 
not $30 an hour? The reason is because 
it doesn’t actually work. If you just 
raise the minimum wage to a different 
level than the marginal contribution 
value of that job, what happens is the 
firms either cease to exist or people 
automate more rapidly. 
There are reasonable arguments to be 
made—certainly there are emotional 
and humanitarian arguments to be 
made—for wanting a $15 minimum 
wage. But wanting a $15 minimum 
wage is an argument you should make. 
It is not something you do in the midst 
of a public health emergency, and it is 
certainly not something you do in the 
midst of a public health emergency 
where lots and lots of small businesses 
are ceasing to exist because the $15 
minimum wage will just drive more 
people out of business. 
So it would be better to have a 15- 
dollar-an-hour job than an 11-dollar-an- 
hour job, but it would be better to have 
an 11-dollar-an-hour job than no job. So 
if you are going to debate a $15 min-
imum wage, please do it in the light of 
day. What Speaker PELOSI
is doing 
here is wrong. 
Page 803. This one goes on for a 
bunch of pages, so I will jump across. 
Line 10: 
SEC. 704. AIRLINE CARBON EMISSIONS 
OFFSETS AND GOALS. 
(a) CARBON OFFSETTING PROGRAM— 
(1) IN GENERAL—Not later than 90 days 
after the enactment of this Act, the Admin-
istrator of the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion shall require each air carrier receiving 
assistance under section 101, to fully offset 
the annual carbon emissions of such air car-
riers for domestic flights beginning in 2025 
. . . 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of 
the Federal Aviation Administration shall 
require each air carrier receiving assistance 
under section 101 to— 
(A) make and achieve a binding commit-
ment to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions 
attributable to the domestic flights of such 
air carrier in every calendar year, beginning 
with 2021, on a path consistent with a 25 per-
cent reduction in the aviation sector’s emis-
sions from 2005 levels by 2035, and a 50 per-
cent reduction in the sector’s emissions from 
2005 level to apply by the year 2050. 
This is like something out of the 
Green New Deal for the age of COVID– 
19, but it is just the technocratic piece 
for airline emissions—and here we are 
dealing with the part about airline 
emissions from the year 2035 to the 
year 2050. 
If you have been looking at the data 
this afternoon, one of things that Scott 
Gottlieb has been talking a lot about 
today is we see that the hospitalization 
rates and the case fatality rate for the 
45- to 54-year-old hospital admissions, 
COVID–19 
patients 
in 
the 
United 
States, look a lot worse than we 
thought they were a week ago. There 
are some things on the Italy curve that 
are scary and ugly. There are some 
pieces of it where we might think there 
are a little bits of hopeful signs that as 
we have a lot more positive tests—but 
we know we simultaneously have com-
munity transmission problems but we 
also have a lot more testing. If you get 
more positive tests, some of that is be-
cause you have more positive con-
firmation of the disease, but some is 
because you are doing more testing. 
There are some things that might be 
mildly good news, but Gottlieb, who 
has been talking today—former FDA 
Commissioner—has been talking about 
some really bad news, which as we 
talked about, this disease is particu-
larly bad for people over 60, but there 
have been a lot of hopeful signs, besides 
our love of neighbor obligations not to 
be transmitting the disease to our 
grandmas and to our parents and to the 
elderly, among others, but it looks like 
among 45- to 54-year-olds, the death 
rate does look to be—we don’t know, 
but on some preliminary data, it looks 
to be between five-tenths and seven- 
tenths of 1 percent compared to flu at 
one-tenth of 1 percent across the whole 
population. That would be a stunningly 
high case death rate among the 45- to 
54-year-olds. 
Do you know what none of those peo-
ple care about right now? They care 
about it, but they don’t think that we 
should be legislating on it without any 
long debate. None of them are talking 
about airline emissions between the 
years 2035 and 2050. NANCY
PELOSI 
shouldn’t be talking about it either.

my colleagues waiting to talk. Page 
911, line 3: 
SEC. 404. MODIFICATION OF SPECIAL 
RULES FOR MINIMUM FUNDING STAND-
ARDS 
FOR 
COMMUNITY 
NEWSPAPER 
PLANS. 
Do you want to know what is going 
to stop the public health crisis? We 
should talk about the business model 
of local newspapers right now rather 
than get the American people the relief 
they need. 
(a) AMENDMENT TO THE INTERNAL 
REVENUE CODE OF 1986.—Subsection (m) of 
section 430 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as added by the Setting Every Commu-
nity Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 
2019, is amended to read as follows: 
(m) SPECIAL RULES FOR COMMUNITY 
NEWSPAPER PLANS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—An eligible newspaper 
plan sponsor of a plan under which no partic-
ipant has had the participant’s accrued ben-
efit increased (whether because of service or 
compensation) after April 2, 2019, may elect 
to have the alternative standards described 
in paragraph (4) apply to such plan. 
(2) ELIGIBLE NEWSPAPER PLAN SPON-
SOR.—The term ‘eligible newspaper plan 
sponsor’ here means— 
And then there are like four or five 
different definitions of what an eligible 
newspaper plan sponsor would mean. 
If the American people wonder why 
Congress hasn’t passed a coronavirus 
emergency health and emergency eco-
nomics relief plan, I think it would be 
great if Speaker PELOSI went out and 
stood before a gaggle of reporters be-
fore the cameras and started talking 
about the newspaper sponsor alter-
native plan definition provisions of her 
bid in this negotiation on page 911, sub-
section (b). 
One more for now. On page 931: 
TITLE V—REHABILITATION FOR MUL-
TIEMPLOYER PENSIONS 
Line 16: 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is estab-
lished in the Department of Treasury an 
agency to be known as the ‘‘Pension Reha-
bilitation Administration’’. 
By the way, there is no such thing. 
This doesn’t exist. It is being created of 
whole cloth here. So in the middle of a 
national health pandemic emergency, 
we are creating now bureaucracies to 
deal with insolvent pensions. 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF POSITION.— 
There shall be a head of the Pension Reha-
bilitation Administration a Director, who 
shall be appointed by the President. 
(2) TERM.—In General, the term of Direc-
tor shall last 5 years. 
I am going to stop. This is wrong. 
This ought not to be happening. It is 
not being done in good faith. Basically,

S1961 
March 23, 2020 
none of this stuff is really going to be 
considered in any negotiation. It is a 
guise and a rouse to try to move the 
goalpost. 
When people play nine innings of a 
baseball game in a negotiation and 
somebody decided to use a whole bunch 
of their pitchers, then the decision was 
made, hey, let’s add five more innings 
to the baseball game—the American 
people are waiting for this relief act, 
and it has gone on for another 36 hours 
here for no reason that is honorable 
and sincere. There are a whole bunch of 
big and real debates that could be had 
inside the four corners of the four, kind 
of five task forces that helped write 
this piece of legislation. There are lots 
of reasonable debates to be had inside 
that. Throwing in a laundry list of 
Christmas list lighting is why this 
place bleeds public trust. 
The Democratic whip in the House 
said it explicitly: ‘‘A tremendous op-
portunity exists [in this crisis] to re-
structure things here to fit our vision.’’ 
None of these things—none of these 
1,119 pages are about solving the crisis, 
none of the nine paragraphs that I de-
cided to read, beat the virus, none of 
these things keeps small business alive. 
I get it. Expenses. Speaker PELOSI is 
a liberal progressive from San Fran-
cisco. I am a conservative from Ne-
braska. We have a different political 
philosophy. That is fine. It is com-
pletely reasonable for us to debate pol-
itics and policy and ideology when we 
are not in the middle of a crisis. 
Speaker PELOSI could bring her lib-
eral wish list to the House floor for a 
vote any time she wants. Unlike most 
of us, she controls an agenda, but she 
ought to have the decency to vote on 
her ideologically driven wish list after 
this emergency legislation has been 
passed. 
We are better than this. This is not 
the way to restore the public trust. We 
should do better. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
know we are talking about the unprec-
edented times that we are facing in our 
Nation, but I want to talk about some-
thing that we have in common, some-
thing that is pretty remarkable and 
that I think we all need to remember 
that we have in common. We represent 
incredible people, the American people, 
who are doing so much right now—in 
Alaska, in Colorado, in Nebraska, in 
Montana, and in Connecticut—to help 
each other so much. 
I frequently tell my constituents, as 
we are talking about getting through 
this crisis, that everyone has a role to 
play—young, 
old, 
business 
leaders, 
elected leaders, union members—and 
everybody is playing a role. So I am 
very proud of my constituents in Alas-
ka, and I know that everybody in this 
body is proud of what their constitu-
ents are doing right now, the best of 
our Nation is doing right now. 
We talk a lot about how we are tele-
working. I would like to remind folks 
that there are some Americans, a lot of 
Alaskans—thousands, 
millions—who 
can’t telework. Our healthcare profes-
sionals who are on the frontlines, our 
first responders, our truckdrivers, port 
workers, Alaskans who are stocking 
the grocery store shelves, picking up 
our refuse, parents who are teaching 
their children at home, local res-
taurants who are working day and 
night to continue to provide takeout 
food—so many people are doing such 
good work. 
There is an incredible outpouring of 
generosity from all of our citizens, all 
Americans, and we are hearing about 
it, from our small businesses donating 
their time and services to help people 
in their communities, to volunteers, 
and to our nonprofits. That is what 
Alaskans are doing, and that is what 
Americans are doing around the coun-
try at this very moment, despite this 
enormous adversity and the challenges 
we are facing—one of the most unprec-
edented challenges in our history. 
These are extraordinary and precar-
ious times right now. People are obvi-
ously concerned about their health. 
People are obviously concerned about 
their economic health, their jobs, los-
ing jobs, retirement accounts, life sav-
ings. People are being told to stay at 
home. They are hard-working Ameri-
cans, Alaskans who have worked their 
whole lives, who don’t even know how 
they are going to pay for their gro-
ceries or rent. And they are taking 
these actions at a difficult time be-
cause local and State governments all 
across the country are making tough 
decisions, working with their commu-
nities to help make sure that the col-
lective whole of our societies, whether 
in Anchorage or Fairbanks or other 
places in America, are going to get 
through this health crisis. The bottom 
line is that they are coming together 
in a shared sacrifice. 
I am so proud of the people I rep-
resent, and I know my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle are as well. It is 
something we have in common. 
There was an article in the Wash-
ington Post just the other day, like 2 
days ago. It said something like, you 
know, America has gotten through a 
lot of challenges before: World War II, 
the Civil War. But this article went on 
to say: But perhaps the American peo-
ple don’t really have the mettle or the 
resiliency to get through this one. 
That was kind of the gist of this arti-
cle—classic, clueless, inside-the-belt-
way reporting—that we are not the 
same America that got through other 
challenges; that we don’t have the met-
tle. Well, I would suggest that these 
Washington Post reporters need to get 
out of DC. Maybe they should go to 
Alaska. Maybe they should go some-
where else in America. Come to my 
State. I guarantee you, we have the 
mettle—Alaskans 
and 
other 
great 
Americans—to get through this crisis. 
I always say that my constituents 
are some of the most resilient people in 
the world. Let me just give you a cou-
ple of examples. Our Alaskan Native 
communities have been thriving for 
thousands of years in some of the 
harshest conditions anywhere on the 
planet. We are a State full of the ances-
tors of rugged pioneers who came to 
Alaska looking for promise and stayed 
to build a great State. 
Throughout our history in my State, 
we have had extreme challenges before. 
Earthquakes have flattened our build-
ings. Tsunamis have wiped out cities. 
Floods have swept away our homes and 
entire communities. Wildfires have 
singed our cities. Volcanic eruptions 
have dimmed the Sun. The price of oil 
and the market have dropped before, as 
we are seeing now. And now we have 
another unprecedented challenge, a 
pandemic facing my beloved State and 
my beloved country. 
As I mentioned, we have a lot in com-
mon here, and I think a lot of us—all of 
us—take pride in what our constitu-
ents, our fellow Americans, are doing 
to come together to fight this. And we 
will fight it. We will emerge stronger 
and more resilient, and those Wash-
ington Post reporters who doubted the 
will of Americans, maybe in a couple of 
years, will be writing a story about 
how wrong they were. 
Until about a day ago, I was actually 
proud of the work of this body in re-
sponding to this crisis. For the past 3 
weeks, we have come together, putting 
together bold, bipartisan pieces of leg-
islation to address this pandemic in a 
quick amount of time. There is what 
we are calling phase 1 just 2 weeks ago, 
where Congress passed an $8.3-billion 
package—I will not go into all of the 
details—to 
address 
the 
healthcare 
needs that we are starting to see with 
the spread of this pandemic. That was 
phase 1. 
Phase 2—just last week, again, Mem-
bers of this body came together. It 
wasn’t a perfect bill, that is for sure, 
that came over from the House that 
provided Federal funds so that individ-
uals exposed to the virus could get 
healthy and so that our hospitals have 
more resources to combat this health 
crisis. The President passed it the day 
we passed it here in the Senate. That 
was just last week. 
It was bold, bipartisan work. For ex-
ample, this legislation expanded emer-
gency food assistance, including for 
children who rely on free and reduced 
lunch, lunches from school cafeterias 
where they could no longer access 
those meals because schools are clos-
ing, new paid sick leave—100-percent 
dollar for dollar—that would be paid 
and reimbursed by the Federal Govern-
ment. So we acted. We acted. 
These weren’t perfect pieces of legis-
lation. I didn’t like every provision in 
them, but we got together—Democrats 
and Republicans—and we acted quickly 
and boldly. And that is what our con-
stituents want us to do. 
But we knew we had to do much, 
much more—much, much more—be-
cause every day, there is a new devel-
opment we are seeing, not just on the 
health side but on the economic side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1962 
March 23, 2020 
So what did we do? Last week, every-
body here rolled up their sleeves and 
worked around the clock. Again, I was 
proud of the work that we started on. 
By the way, this was bipartisan work. 
I was talking to Democratic Senators 
all weekend. When you listen to the 
chairman of the Finance Committee, 
he talked about the task force that we 
had—Democrats and Republicans—put-
ting together legislation—big, bold leg-
islation—coming together like we had 
on phase 1 and phase 2 to really focus 
in on four key areas: putting cash di-
rectly in the hands of hurting families 
in Alaska and throughout the country, 
delivering rapid relief to the small 
businesses that are being crushed by 
this pandemic and laying off their 
workers, stabilizing key industries to 
avoid massive layoffs that are now 
very quickly coming on the horizon 
and starting to happen in America, and 
sending new resources to medical pro-
fessionals who are on the frontlines. 
Those were our goals, and we needed to 
do it in a big way. 
We completed this, the Senate—Re-
publicans and Democrats—in less than 
a week. Why? Because all of us knew 
the people we represent were hurting 
and are hurting. They need hope, and 
they are looking to us for that hope. 
Again, it wasn’t perfect. This bill 
isn’t perfect, but it is pretty remark-
able work to do in less than a week. 
This bill represents a huge and massive 
effort to help the people we represent. 
Now, a lot of my colleagues have 
been coming down on the floor talking 
about what this bill will do for the peo-
ple we represent. I am not going to go 
into all of the details, but let me just 
name a few because some of them were 
ideas from our Democratic colleagues. 
Where we had certain amounts in the 
bill, they came and said: No, we want 
more. 
We said: OK, all right, we will work 
with you, just like we did on phase 1 
and phase 2. 
I will just mention a few. I have been 
talking to a lot of the elected leaders 
throughout my State, making a lot of 
calls and asking: What do you need? 
What is happening? How can we help? I 
had a phone conversation just a few 
days ago with the mayor of Anchorage. 
That is my hometown. Everybody is 
working hard. The mayor is. The Gov-
ernor is doing a good job, a really good 
job, and his team. We are all working 
together. The mayor is a Democrat. 
The Governor is a Republican. I am 
reaching out to everybody. It doesn’t 
matter the party at this moment, that 
is for darn sure. 
What did the mayor say to me? He 
said: The priority has to be that people 
need cash, Senator, to pay the rent, to 
buy food, and to make their car pay-
ment. There is so much uncertainty. 
Can we do that? Yes, we can do that. 
We did it. It is in the bill. There is 
$2,400 per couple and $500 per additional 
child. That is going to help. That is 
going to help families who need cash. 
That is one thing. 
Another thing is we had a massive in-
crease to the unemployment insurance 
program, a quarter of $1 trillion—$250 
billion. Why? Because we are seeing 
massive layoffs. 
Now, I am going to give credit to my 
colleagues. A couple of Democratic col-
leagues, friends of mine, are on the 
floor right now. This was a big idea 
that they wanted to push. It is big 
number. It is a big number—a quarter 
of a trillion dollars. This is going to 
significantly expand the number of in-
dividuals who are eligible to receive 
benefits. This is really important for 
my State, particularly the self-em-
ployed—the fishermen, who have never 
been covered under the UI programs in 
the past. 
And, once more, the bill provides a 
flat increase in benefits, $600 per week 
to all State programs in the next few 
months. So workers who are forced to 
file unemployment—unfortunately, we 
are 
seeing 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
across the country—have the financial 
security to pay their bills and stay 
afloat. So this is another big element 
of this bill. 
Let me provide one more that I think 
is one of the most important. And I 
think there is really strong bipartisan 
agreement on this one. I know it be-
cause I talk to my friends who are 
Democrats. It is a small business res-
cue package and relief package of 
about $350 billion to enable small busi-
nesses to access credit and have the li-
quidity to stay afloat and weather this 
storm, not creating a new bureaucracy 
but an expansion of the Small Business 
Administration’s 7(a) loan program so 
you can do it through local banks in 
your State. The idea here is to make 
sure the worker and the employers of 
our small businesses stay connected. 
Small businesses can take out a loan 
of up to $10 million under this program, 
and if they use that loan to pay for 
payroll and rent and other fixed costs, 
this loan is going to be completely for-
given. 
Whenever I describe this to my fellow 
Alaskans, they say: This is exactly the 
kind of thing we need, Senator, right 
now, as businesses are closing. 
So that is in. That is in the bill—cash 
in the hands of small businesses so 
they can keep workers employed and 
be ready to get back up and grow and 
prosper again when we get through this 
pandemic. That is in the bill. Every-
body agrees with that. 
Finally, another element—and I am 
just describing some of the elements, 
but I wanted to highlight some of these 
things—is getting more resources to 
the men and women on the frontlines 
of this pandemic who are, every day, 
out there in the healthcare industry 
trying to keep Americans and Alaskans 
healthy and alive. 
How much? There is a lot in it, but 
the number is $100 billion for hospitals, 
for healthcare providers. Let me say 
that again: $100 billion. 
The minority leader was on the floor 
the other day. I was kind of stunned 
when he said something along the lines 
of this partisan bill—and, by the way, 
it is not partisan, OK; this was written 
by Republicans and Democrats, and a 
lot of these ideas are from both sides— 
doesn’t do anything to help hospitals. 
We need a Marshall Plan to help them. 
Well, I think $100 billion is a pretty 
good start. That is in the bill. 
So, as I mentioned, I have been proud 
of the work of this body. I have been 
proud of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. No one has wisdom on how to 
fix all this. No one knows what is com-
ing in the future. But I think all of us 
know that we need to act, and we need 
to act boldly, and we need to act in a 
bipartisan way. And we did it. We did 
it, again, in less than a week. 
It is not a perfect bill—that is for 
sure—but it is going to provide help to 
my fellow Alaskans, to Americans. It is 
massive. It is bold. It is bipartisan. It 
is timely. And, as of yesterday, I 
thought we were going to get another 
bill out to the American people quick-
ly. Hope—that is what they need. Yes, 
the Senate is working. 
Then, for whatever reason—and I am 
not going to point fingers—the wheels 
started to come off on this one, the one 
that we really need. And the bill has 
been filibustered. That means we can’t 
even get on the floor to debate it. We 
can’t start debating it. 
Now, look, I have been listening to 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. There has been a lot of anger on 
this floor, a lot of back-and-forth. My 
good friend from Nebraska just talked 
about this idea that somehow my col-
leagues on the other side filibustered 
this bill that the Senate has been 
working on to make room for Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill. I really, really, really 
hope that is not true. I really hope that 
is not true. I don’t think there is one 
Member of this body, Republican or 
Democratic, who could defend now 
what Senator SASSE just read on the 
floor. 
Then there started to be talk about, 
well, the bill that we had, that we are 
focused on, is all about bailouts. That 
is a charged term. But you could talk 
about the 2008–2009 Tart bill—I wasn’t a 
Member of the Senate then, during the 
financial crisis—as a bailout. I think 
that is a good description. 
Why was that a bailout? Because you 
had people on Wall Street taking risky 
actions that eventually cratered the fi-
nancial system—by the way, they made 
a ton of money doing it—and cratered 
the economy. Then they had to be 
bailed out because the banks were 
going to go under, and it was going to 
ruin the U.S. economy. That is a bail-
out. That is a classic bailout. 
What we are seeing right now is 
much more like a natural disaster, 
much more like a war. There is no one 
to be blamed right now. The airlines 
shouldn’t be blamed for what is hap-
pening right now. This is a pandemic. 
So this term being thrown around of, 
oh, it is a bailout—what we are trying 
to do is help the American worker, help 
the American family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1963 
March 23, 2020 
It is not a perfect bill, but we are 
dealing with a natural disaster. Some-
thing came over from overseas onto 
our shores, and we are now all trying 
to deal with it. 
I am going to conclude by saying: I 
am on this side of the aisle. I am a Re-
publican with principled views on cer-
tain issues. I certainly have strong 
views about protecting my State. But I 
have also tried to work, throughout my 
time in the Senate, with my colleagues 
on both sides. Some of my closest 
friends are my Democratic friends. I 
am proud of that work. That is how 
you get things done in this body. Some 
I have been working with all weekend. 
This issue should not be about par-
tisan politics, so my point was not to 
come down here on the floor and make 
this a partisan speech. We are facing 
one of the most unprecedented chal-
lenges in the history of the United 
States of America. We certainly need 
to move beyond politics. If you looked 
at what was going on in the Senate 
until yesterday, that is exactly what 
we have been doing for the past 3 
weeks. 
Are there areas of compromise in this 
bill that hopefully can unlock things? 
Sure. Two that I have been working on 
and supporting, again, with my Demo-
cratic colleagues, pressing my col-
leagues on: Could we have more trans-
parency on this Federal facility pro-
gram? Sure. Absolutely, I would be 
very supportive of this. Are there ways 
to help shore up distressed pensions for 
the great working men and women who 
build things in America? Yes. But we 
are running out of time. We are run-
ning out of time. We need to pass this 
bill now. Why do we need to pass this 
bill now? Because it is going to help 
the people we represent. It is going to 
help people in Connecticut and Vir-
ginia and Colorado and Montana and 
Alaska. And they need hope. They need 
hope right now. 
Again, this bill isn’t perfect. It has 
got a lot of hope. Once we pass it, then 
all of us are going to need to do the 
hard work of making sure that the im-
plementation of this bill goes as effec-
tively and as smoothly as possible. 
Then, when we see mistakes in it, 
which there will be, we need to come 
back here and act to correct this. That 
is what we need to do. 
These are exceptional times for our 
country. We had an influenza outbreak 
in 1918 that ravaged the world, and it 
particularly ravaged my State. As Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI said earlier today, one 
of the things that has got a lot of us 
troubled in Alaska is, 100 years ago 
when the influenza came through, it 
did finally get to some of our Alaska 
Native villages. I have over 200 commu-
nities, not connected by roads, with 
very limited healthcare facilities. Dur-
ing the Spanish influenza, many of 
these communities were completely 
wiped out. 
It is a scary time—a scary time—but 
we are going to get through it. We are 
going to get through it stronger, more 
resilient, and the way we are going to 
do it is if we are all working together, 
which we had been until about 24 hours 
ago. 
So I think the provisions outlined in 
this bill, while not perfect, are what 
the American people are looking for. 
They can help minimize the damage 
done by this pandemic. And I certainly 
hope we come together the way we 
have been for the last 3 weeks, in a bi-
partisan way, to get this voted on and 
passed as quickly as possible because 
every hour of delay imperils the in-
credible American people whom we rep-
resent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to follow my friend and col-
league and fellow Marine from Alaska. 
We are separated by about as far a geo-
graphical distance as there can be in 
this Nation: Alaska and Connecticut. I 
am also pleased to be followed by a col-
league from Colorado who is almost 
smack in the middle. And we are 
united despite our geographic dif-
ferences and despite our political dif-
ferences. 
I want to assure the American people 
that the contention they have seen on 
this floor in no way reflects the reality 
of our hope and desire to move quickly 
and to move big to address this unprec-
edented, historic crisis—a healthcare 
emergency and an economic emergency 
in this country. 
The reality is that right now, less 
than 25 yards from us, the minority 
leader, the Democratic leader, CHUCK 
SCHUMER; and perhaps the Secretary of 
the Treasury or his representatives; 
and also representatives of the White 
House are literally working on a better 
bill, a bill that better protects workers. 
Workers and families should come 
first, not corporate interests. Small 
businesses should be a priority. They 
are the economic backbone and major 
employer in our country. 
It will be a better and a bigger bill in 
addressing the medical surge that this 
country must confront: the imminent 
soaring of numbers of cases; the poten-
tially fatal infections that are about to 
deluge our hospitals and healthcare fa-
cilities; and the need for ventilators, 
masks, tests, gowns, all kinds of equip-
ment that will help to save lives. 
I think all of us could do well by lis-
tening to the American people about 
the need for a bigger, better, bolder 
bill. 
I have been inspired by how resolute 
and resilient the people of Connecticut 
have been. Over the last 2 or 3 weeks, I 
have talked to them around the State 
of Connecticut before we were re-
stricted in our meetings, and then by 
talks on the telephone, by telecon-
ferences, and conversations. 
I have spoken within the last few 
days to the Greater Danbury Chamber 
of Commerce and small businesses that 
they assembled and large ones, the 
Northwestern Chamber of Commerce, 
meetings of small businesses from the 
Hartford area, the Federally Qualified 
Health Centers of Connecticut, hospital 
executives, doctors, and professionals 
who are dealing with this crisis now on 
the frontlines, and, of course, local of-
ficials. 
Just today, I spoke with the South 
Central Council of Governments, with 
mayors and local officials from up and 
down the coast of Connecticut, great 
nonprofits like Americare and food 
banks like Food Share. 
What they are telling me is do it ur-
gently, do it big, but do it right. We 
need to do it quickly, but we need to 
get it right. That is why this addi-
tional time is absolutely the right 
thing when we are talking about al-
most $2 trillion in taxpayer money and 
a crisis that demands careful and delib-
erate thought. 
I was a critic of the last bailout be-
cause it insufficiently protected work-
ers and consumers. We know that we 
can do better than they did then, and 
we will because we are putting workers 
first. 
What I have heard, in listening to the 
people of Connecticut, talking to small 
businesses who are fearful about clos-
ing their doors and going broke, work-
ers who are scared about losing their 
jobs, and nonprofits who are frightened 
about failing in their missions for lack 
of resources—they are hurting and are 
fearful about being crushed by this 
healthcare and economic crisis. 
That is why we need to work to-
gether to protect the men and women 
who own those small and medium-sized 
businesses with a generous loan and 
grant program. We should take care of 
their workers with an expanded unem-
ployment compensation program and 
guarantee that those small businesses 
will, in fact, maintain their payrolls. 
If we are going to provide money to 
big industries like the airlines, we 
must include conditions, strings at-
tached, that put workers first—no lay-
offs, no salary cuts for workers or sal-
ary increases to the corporate execu-
tives and no stock buybacks, and treat 
consumers fairly. That should be the 
set of principles. 
Right now, all across America and in 
Connecticut, working families are wor-
ried about whether they are going to 
see another paycheck. They are wor-
ried about how they are going to pay 
their rent and utility bills, put food on 
the table, clothe their children. Small 
businesses are watching years of hard 
work—years of risk-taking and entre-
preneurial energy—potentially teeter 
on the brink of absolute collapse. We 
face calamity and catastrophe—not the 
fault of any of them or workers or 
large or small executives, but we must 
respond to the magnitude of this mo-
ment. 
I spoke on a radio program this 
morning, Chaz and AJ on WPLR, and I 
was asked: Will it be bipartisan? Can 
you be bipartisan? The answer is, clear-
ly, yes. We have been on two relief 
packages, and we will be on this one, as

early as tomorrow or the next day be-
cause no partisan plan will pass as a 
creation of one party or another. 
Storefronts and inventory lists aren’t 
the backbone of our economy; it is the 
millions of men and women who go to 
work every day and, even tomorrow, 
will do their job, even in the face of the 
uncertainty and the fear that they con-
front. Doing right by our economy 
means doing right by them—the work-
ing families of America. 
There is much the President could do 
if he uses, for example, the Defense 
Production Act or similar kinds of 
power that, so far, he has resisted in-
voking. He could provide the medical 
tools we will need to confront the com-
ing crisis by taking advantage of the 
offers he has received from GM and 
other major companies to produce the 
ventilators or the private protective 
gear that will help to save lives. 
There is much that we all must do in 
continuing to observe the restrictions 
that will help save lives—not only re-
strictions physically in our homes but 
also the perspective we must have that 
we are in for a long fight against this 
invisible foe. And it will be much 
longer than 15 days. It will be a matter 
of months, not weeks, and we must 
have the resilience and resoluteness 
that I have heard from the people of 
Connecticut in their voices as I have 
spoken to them. 
We live in no ordinary time, as Elea-
nor Roosevelt said about her era. We 
must muster the same kind of deter-
mination, grit, and courage to face it. 
I know there is that transcendent 
sense of urgency to do it quickly and to 
do it right and a shared sense of pur-
pose that ultimately will get us to the 
other side of this crisis. We will be bet-
ter and stronger and a bigger nation, 
not only in our economy; we will be a 
bigger nation because we have come to-
gether in meeting this crisis. 
Shared sacrifice must mean truly 
sharing the benefits with workers, with 
families, and with small businesses 
that will ultimately help us to save our 
Nation and our economy. My hope is 
that we will do it quickly, but we will 
do it right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank my colleague from Con-
necticut for his remarks tonight and 
for the hopefulness that he has ex-
pressed. I have been here now for 11 
years, and I can’t predict success here, 
and I can’t say it is assured, but I 
think it is very likely that we are 
going to come together in a deal. I 
hope we come together in that deal 
today, and I think the American people 
are going to be able to assess the 
progress that has been made for work-
ers as a result of taking a little bit of 
extra time, for hospitals as a result of 
a little extra time, for State and local 
governments that are going to benefit 
mightily because of the work we have 
done. 
I rise tonight not to get into this 
back-and-forth about this because I 
think we are going to address it, and I 
think we are going to address it in a 
way that is meaningful and in a way 
that is bipartisan and in a way that 
can help give the American people a 
measure of confidence that we are 
doing our job. For those of you who 
have heard me over the years on this 
floor, I don’t always come here with a 
report that optimistic. But tonight, 
given everything I have heard over the 
course of the day, I want to say that 
this is a serious problem. It is an un-
precedented challenge. We have to rise 
to this challenge together, and I be-
lieve that when the votes are counted 
on this bill, it will have been a better 
bill for the work that has been done, 
and the vote will be a big bipartisan 
vote, which will be a shot in the arm 
for the country and for the American 
people. 
I want to talk not about this back- 
and-forth, but I want to talk about 
something that is confronting us; that 
is, the worst pandemic in a century. 
Just a month ago, just 30 days ago, no-
body here would have imagined—30 
days ago we had 30 confirmed cases in 
the United States. Today, there are 
over 41,000 cases, the most anywhere 
outside of China and Italy. 
The President is right. He goes out 
and says that there are 140-some coun-
tries that have this. That is true. We 
are in the top three of those countries. 
There are 379 Americans who have died 
as we are here tonight. In the middle of 
the worst public health crisis in a cen-
tury, our medical community doesn’t 
have the basic supplies and equipment 
they need to respond. 
This matters because if we don’t get 
our doctors and nurses protective gear, 
they are going to get sick. If they get 
sick, they can’t help everyone else who 
is sick. That is a huge problem, and our 
medical professionals in Colorado, as in 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and all 
across this great country, have been 
begging for us to pay attention to this 
for months—for months. 
The chief medical officer at Denver 
Health—which is our fabulous public 
hospital in Denver, one of the leading 
hospitals in this country—says that 
they do not have enough tests or swabs 
to keep pace, and the turnaround time 
for tests is taking much too long. ‘‘Our 
ICU right now is full of patients await-
ing test results,’’ she said. ‘‘We need 
faster testing.’’ Hopefully that is com-
ing, but it has been a long time getting 
here. 
And 
every 
single 
healthcare 
worker who is tested in this country 
but does not get a result for 5 or 6 or 7 
or 8 days—even if they don’t have the 
coronavirus—can’t go back to work. 
As a result of that, we face a severe 
shortage of healthcare workers in this 
country. At Denver Health, they say: 
‘‘We are burning through our personal 
protective equipment to the point that 
we are on short supply, as is every 
other health care institution in Denver 
and likely in Colorado.’’ 
If this continues, she said they are 
going to have to put two patients on a 
single ventilator. That is not how it is 
supposed to work. 
In Colorado, our nurses are sewing 
masks because they don’t have masks. 
My wife was sewing a mask at our 
home in Denver yesterday—in the 
United States, in the 21st century. 
We have doctors who are getting just 
a single mask and being told to use it 
indefinitely. I was on the phone this 
evening with doctors and administra-
tors from our hospitals who are telling 
me that they are having to ration 
swabs for tests. It is a two-swab test, 
but they are only using one swab be-
cause they don’t have enough swabs to 
do it properly. There are doctors who 
are having to use the same mask pa-
tient after patient when the mask is 
designed for it to be only one patient; 
that is the way it is supposed to work. 
They are violating protocols of the 
Food and Drug Administration and the 
Centers for Disease Control because 
they are rationing equipment. There is 
no excuse in this country—the richest 
country—that they should be rationing 
in this public healthcare crisis. Gowns, 
masks, 
shields, 
clothes—America’s 
healthcare workers don’t have any of 
it. And do you know what they spent 
today 
doing? 
They 
spent 
today 
scrolling through ads—not all of them, 
not the ones with patients, but the 
ones who have to equip our medical 
professionals. 
They 
were 
scrolling 
through ad after ad after ad—from 
where? China—saying that their masks 
are for sale in China. They have no idea 
whether these are fly-by-night organi-
zations. 
These companies are requiring Den-
ver Health and other hospitals to put 
the money upfront and say: You will 
get the masks 3 or 4 weeks from now. 
They don’t even know whether those 
masks will come. They don’t know 
what the quality of those masks will 
be. We were told yesterday by the 
President that China was sending us 
masks, and now all of those seem to be 
being sent to Italy. 
I saw a quote from a doctor in Cali-
fornia who said it is like ‘‘We are at 
war with no ammo.’’ That is not their 
fault. That is not their fault. They are 
on the frontlines of this war. We should 
be ashamed. We should be ashamed. I 
am. 
The question is, How are we going to 
make sure our medical community has 
the supplies and equipment they need? 
Perhaps it would be useful to be honest 
about where we are, to start with. 
The 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services estimates that we are 
going to need 3.5 billion masks to fight 
this pandemic this year. When you 
hear me tonight use the word ‘‘mask,’’ 
in your own mind add the word 
‘‘gown,’’ add the word ‘‘glove,’’ add the 
word ‘‘shield’’ because they need all of 
that—3.5 billion masks to fight this 
pandemic this year. The administra-
tion came with their first supplemental 
requesting $1.8 billion; today we are at

$2 trillion in just the last month. They 
came and said 1.8 billion. We said we 
need 350 million masks. We need 3.5 bil-
lion masks—billion masks—this year. 
Today in America, we have exactly 35 
million masks. That is 1 percent of 
what we need—not 80 percent but 1 per-
cent of what we need. 
Nationwide tonight, our hospitals 
have 160,000 ventilators among all the 
hospitals we have in the greatest coun-
try in the world. Johns Hopkins esti-
mates that we are going to need an-
other 40,000 ventilators by the time 
this is done. 
In Colorado tonight, I heard—this 
might be of interest to the other Sen-
ators who are here tonight because 
New York represents half of the cases 
in this country right now. The concern 
from Colorado, and I am sure from 
your States as well, is that all those 
ventilators are going to go to New 
York, as they should right now because 
that is where the greatest need is. 
What is going to be left for the rest of 
us? What is going to be left for the rest 
of us in 7 days or 10 days or 20 days? 
How can we be this foolish? How can 
we be this blind? The administration 
hasn’t 
taken 
this 
crisis 
seriously 
enough from the beginning. 
When it comes to the equipment that 
people on the frontline need—the ‘‘am-
munition,’’ to use their word, that the 
people on the frontline need—they are 
being ignored or dismissed with a 
bunch of happy talk about how we are 
going to solve this problem—if we can 
even admit that there is a problem. 
The 
result 
is 
something 
I 
never 
thought I would see in the United 
States of America, the country I grew 
up in. States like New York and New 
Jersey are literally being forced to out-
bid—States like New York are being 
forced to outbid New Jersey and Cali-
fornia to secure critical supplies while 
they are fighting through the worst 
public health crisis in a century. 
Yesterday, during his press con-
ference in the White House, the Presi-
dent said: We want them to be on that 
open market because we might lose 
money if we are not on that open mar-
ket. 
Exactly the opposite of what he 
thinks is happening, is happening. Gov-
ernors like Andrew Cuomo are being 
forced to pay $7 for surgical masks that 
just a week ago cost 85 cents. My doc-
tors in Colorado told me tonight that 
stuff yesterday that was five times the 
cost of what it ordinarily is, today is 
seven times the cost of what it ordi-
narily is. In Colorado, our children’s 
hospital is paying 70 cents a mask. 
That is 10 times what they were spend-
ing a month ago. Ventilators that used 
to cost a few thousand dollars now cost 
up to $40,000 because the President 
won’t act. He will not provide the na-
tional leadership that we need. 
Ten days ago, when talking about the 
test, he said: ‘‘I don’t take any respon-
sibility at all.’’ That is what he said. 
He may think that he doesn’t have the 
blame for everything that has gone 
wrong—and I am sure he doesn’t—but 
he does have a very profound responsi-
bility now that only Presidents of the 
United States have. 
When Governors from across the 
country raised the supply shortages 
with him last week, he told them to 
‘‘get it yourself.’’ He told them that 
the Federal Government is not ‘‘a ship-
ping clerk.’’ 
He said: 
The governors, locally, are going to be in 
command. We will be following them, and we 
hope they can do the job. . . . We are there 
to back you up should you fail. 
We are failing, Mr. President. We are 
failing to address the seriousness of the 
public health crisis this country is fac-
ing. And we are going to rue the day 
that we said it was the hospitals’ prob-
lem to solve, that it was the Gov-
ernors’ problem to solve, that it was 
the States’ problem to solve. 
I want to say this to the American 
people tonight because it is really im-
portant that you know what the facts 
are. It is important for you to know 
that we don’t need tens of thousands of 
masks or millions of masks. We need 
billions of masks and all the other 
equipment that I talked about earlier— 
gowns, shields, swabs, the elements of 
tests, the reagents that are necessary 
to take those tests. When I say ‘‘we,’’ I 
am talking about the healthcare pro-
fessionals we are relying on to be the 
frontline in this effort. 
What is the President’s response to 
this? He has touted about the ship-
ments coming out of our national 
stockpile. I am coming to think this 
national stockpile must be more like a 
really small national warehouse. 
Colorado received that shipment yes-
terday. We are grateful for it. We are 
grateful for the shipment we got from 
the national stockpile. I want my col-
leagues to hear me. The Department of 
Public Health in Colorado estimates 
that those supplies will last for a single 
day of statewide operation—1 day. 
Then the President comes out and 
talks about the tens of thousands of 
masks that are going to New York or 
California, as if that can make the dif-
ference. It won’t make a difference 
when you need millions of masks. 
Then, at the press conference yester-
day, he suggested that the new com-
mitments by private businesses will 
somehow be enough. He said: The num-
bers are quite large, and we have tre-
mendous numbers of companies mak-
ing equipment. We have respirators. We 
have ventilators. We have a lot of 
things happening right now. We have 
millions of masks that are coming. 
Millions of masks, not billions. 
They will be here soon, he said. They 
will be shipped directly to the States. 
He failed to mention that soon actu-
ally means 18 months from now. That 
is not going to help us. We don’t have 
18 months. It is literally life and death. 
It is for all of these reasons that we 
ask the President to invoke his au-
thorities under the Defense Production 
Act, which gives him and him alone the 
ability to mobilize private industry so 
we can ramp up production in a coordi-
nated and coherent way, so we can 
have a national approach to fixing this 
broken supply chain, to fixing the 
empty storerooms, and to putting 
these critical supplies and equipment 
on the frontline. 
I was so pleased that he invoked 
those authorities 5 days ago, but in-
stead of using them, he has equivo-
cated. He said things like we have the 
act to use ‘‘just in case we need it. But 
we have so many things being made. 
. . .’’ He didn’t finish the sentence, but 
he meant this voluntary effort—which 
I deeply appreciate, by the way. Don’t 
get me wrong. Every single mask and 
every single gown and every single 
shield that can be manufactured and 
every single respirator that can be 
manufactured and lent to the people on 
the lines—that is important, but it is 
not going to solve this crisis. It is not 
going to keep us in a position where we 
can actually flatten the curve. 
He said yesterday: ‘‘We’re a country 
not based on nationalizing our busi-
nesses. Call a person over in Venezuela, 
ask them how did nationalization for 
their businesses work out?’’ 
As every Senator here knows, the De-
fense Production Act doesn’t nation-
alize businesses. It is our tool. It is a 
mechanism to create a coherent strat-
egy for our public sector and our pri-
vate sector to produce goods based on 
an urgent national need. The govern-
ment pays market value for those 
goods and has a strategy for how those 
goods will be distributed around the 
country as the epidemic moves from 
place to place. 
It is unacceptable that we are in a 
situation where States are having to 
bid against each other, where the hos-
pitals in Colorado are having to bid 
against each other. They said to me to-
night: Michael, if you could just get us 
5 million masks and send them to Colo-
rado, we can distribute them. But it 
makes no sense for us to be looking up 
the yellow pages in China to buy 
masks. 
I said to them: I wish that were 
enough. I wish that would be enough. 
But as long as Colorado is going to 
have to compete with New York, which 
is going to have to compete with New 
Jersey or compete with Florida or com-
pete with Texas, it won’t work. 
It is not just the price, although that 
is shocking. The fact that there are 
people gouging at a moment like this is 
appalling. It is not just the price; it is 
the availability. The nurses and doc-
tors in Denver, CO, or in any city in 
this country tonight should not be 
using one swab for a test. It takes two. 
They should not be wearing one mask 
all day long—a mask that is designed 
to be worn with just one patient. 
The President said yesterday that he 
looked into this as a businessman. He 
was shocked at all the masks being 
thrown away. We ought to be able to 
sterilize the masks. 
There are important reasons why we 
have 
those 
rules—to 
protect 
our

healthcare workers and so we don’t 
spread disease. 
By the way, I asked: Does it solve 
your problem that the President has 
said we can use construction masks 
now in our healthcare facilities? 
They said: We are grateful for the ad-
ditional masks that we are getting, but 
it is not remotely helping fix the scale 
of the problem, and a lot of these 
masks actually aren’t appropriate in a 
healthcare setting. 
They will do anything. They are not 
looking down their noses at it. I had 
somebody say to me today—one of the 
people on the call said that they had 
gotten masks from a finger nail salon 
and that they had no idea what quality 
the masks were. There was Asian writ-
ing on the outside of the package. They 
don’t know what it is, but those masks 
will be there when they run out of all 
the other masks. That is what they are 
going to use. That is what we are using 
in the United States of America to-
night? That is what we are telling the 
people we are asking to save our lives, 
to save our parents’ lives? That is what 
we are saying? 
I am sure the other Senators have 
had the same experience that I have 
had, which is I have been in touch with 
companies all over my State that stand 
ready to help produce supplies and 
equipment. 
The President said yesterday that 
one of the problems he had or one of 
the 
challenges 
he 
had 
was, 
you 
wouldn’t have any idea where to begin. 
I don’t know who makes ventilators. 
Maybe they made them a long time ago 
and they have forgotten how to do it. 
Surely he doesn’t believe that we 
couldn’t figure that out in a split sec-
ond, where the manufacturing capacity 
is in this country to do what needs to 
be done. Yet these companies have said 
to me that nobody in the administra-
tion has been in touch to tell them 
what to make, how much to make, or 
where it should go. 
I say thank you to my colleagues for 
their indulgence, but the truth is—and 
the truth needs to be understood—that 
I think this is a moment in time when 
we have to get this done, but we are 
getting it so wrong. The truth is, as 
much as we welcome all of the citizens 
and businesses that are stepping up on 
their own, it will not be enough. 
Hanes 
can’t 
produce 
3.5 
billion 
masks. It is a great company. As the 
President said yesterday, it is involved 
in cotton products, but it can’t make 
3.5 billion masks, and it can’t do it in 
the time we need it done. GM and Tesla 
can’t manufacture 40,000 ventilators. 
As for the 2 million masks the Vice 
President trumpeted yesterday from 
Apple, we appreciate it, but it is an in-
finitesimal amount. It sounds like a 
big number. That is why the President 
actually said yesterday that the reason 
he came out and read those big num-
bers was so that you would know they 
were sending out lots of stuff. He said 
that, and I think that gives a complete 
misimpression that, somehow, this is 
being handled or that we have it to-
gether. 
We are one nation under God for a 
reason, and that is to respond to a 
challenge just like this one. It cannot 
be one hospital at a time, one State at 
a time, or one business at a time. That 
will not work. It is not a strategy. In 
fact, it is making matters worse be-
cause not only are we not fixing the 
supply chain, but the pricing is getting 
completely distorted, and people are 
competing with an incredibly scarce 
number of goods. 
This is not a substitute for a coher-
ent national strategy to figure out how 
we are going to meet these critical sup-
ply and equipment shortages across the 
country, and every single day, it gets 
worse. You can hear the panic in the 
Governors and in the people who are 
working in our hospitals and in the 
people who are working with people 
who are having to go into unsafe condi-
tions, who are willing to do it. They 
are on the frontline of this war with no 
ammunition. 
As much as the President may not 
want to make these hard decisions, for 
whatever reason—because he hopes for 
the best; because maybe the medical 
thing will work itself out; because 
maybe, instead of 18 months, it will be 
shorter for a vaccine; because maybe 
the hot weather will make things bet-
ter—he is literally the only one with 
the authority to call America to this 
challenge. The President is portraying 
himself as a wartime President, but he 
is leaving it up to Hanes to plan D-day. 
It will not work. He needs to give the 
frontline of this war the ammunition it 
needs, and he is the only one who can 
do it. No one else can do it. This Sen-
ate can’t do it. 
There has been a lot of back-and- 
forth today about a brief delay in pass-
ing this economic package. As I said, I 
hope very much it will pass. I hope 
very much we will have a deal soon. I 
hope very much it will be bipartisan. 
We should do our work, and we should 
get that done. Yet I beg of you—I beg 
of you, my colleagues in the U.S. Sen-
ate—for every Member of this body to 
call on the White House and ask why, 
after weeks, there is still no plan to 
make sure our doctors and nurses have 
the gear to protect themselves; why 
our hospitals still don’t have the ven-
tilators they need to treat people; why 
it is not obvious where those ventila-
tors are going to come from; and why 
we still don’t have a clear strategy 
from this administration to arm the 
frontline that is waging this war while 
we are here tonight. 
This is, perhaps, the greatest chal-
lenge our country has faced since the 
Second World War. It probably is, and 
it is scary. We have risen to challenges 
before, and I think we can rise to this 
one. I may not have voted for the 
President, and I may not agree with 
much of what he does, but I urge him 
to act. I urge him to use the authority 
that is granted to him uniquely in 
America. Out of 330 million Americans, 
only the President of the United States 
has that authority. He won that elec-
tion. He has that authority. We can’t 
do it without him. Lives are literally 
at stake in Colorado and across the 
country. 
We need him to lead, and I beg of all 
the Members of this Chamber to do 
whatever they can, if they have influ-
ence on him, to get him to understand 
the gravity of the situation we are fac-
ing, the scale of the situation we are 
facing—the scope that we are facing— 
and the lack of preparedness that needs 
to be addressed by his invoking his au-
thority under that statute. 
I thank my colleagues for their pa-
tience and their indulgence. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague for his impas-
sioned words that were right on the 
money. 
The Senate is going to adjourn short-
ly, but that doesn’t mean negotiations 
are slowing down one bit. Secretary 
Mnuchin just left my office. We have 
had some very good discussions, and, in 
fact, the list of outstanding issues has 
narrowed significantly. We are going to 
work on into the night. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I had not 
intended to speak today. Yet, in my of-
fice, as I was alternately talking to 
Virginians and colleagues about our 
goal to find an economic package that 
will backstop workers and the Amer-
ican economy, I had the TV on. I was 
watching what was happening on the 
floor, and I decided I would come and 
just speak for a few minutes. 
Frankly, I think that what has been 
happening on the floor today has sort 
of been artificial and hasn’t really 
shown the American public what is 
truly going on. There were a lot of 
speeches that were taking place where-
in it was sort of a blame game, and I 
don’t think that is what Americans 
wanted to see today. Just as there was 
yesterday, there was another vote 
today that failed, a vote that was des-
tined to fail. I don’t think that is what 
Americans deserved to see today. What 
Americans didn’t see yesterday and 
today is the intense dialogue and de-
bate and discussion around the third 
coronavirus response bill—by far, the 
largest. 
It is important to get the details 
right. We spent time getting the de-
tails right, in a bipartisan way, to pass 
an $8 billion supplemental appropria-
tion just 2 weeks ago. We spent time 
getting the details right to pass an ex-
tension of paid childcare and unem-
ployment insurance that had a cost of 
about $100 billion. We are now talking 
about an economic stimulus package 
that could be as high as $2 trillion. The 
American public wants us to get the 
details right. 
As I look at the stimulus discussions, 
there are sort of five pillars, and this is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1967 
March 23, 2020 
the way I describe it to Virginians. It 
is the workers and their families; it is 
small business; it is the large business 
and industry sectors; it is State and 
local 
governments; 
and 
it 
is 
our 
healthcare network. 
As for the workers, we are all hearing 
from people in our States who are so 
significantly affected. They are with-
out salaries and wages. How are they 
going to pay their rents or their mort-
gages? They are in danger of eviction 
and foreclosure. How are they going to 
pay childcare and other expenses? This 
has to be the heart of this bill. I think 
the White House accepts that and that 
we should too. 
This package has to be right for 
working people, and the details matter. 
Only about 26 percent of American 
workers are covered by the unemploy-
ment insurance system. We can’t just 
rely on that old system if we really 
want to backstop all of the people who 
have lost income and be able to protect 
them and their families. 
I saw, over the week, that the Gov-
ernment of the United Kingdom de-
cided to just make a guarantee to all 
working people that they will backstop 
you for 80 percent of your lost earnings 
during the time period of this national 
emergency. We should hold ourselves 
to that standard and try to provide a 
package that backstops workers and 
their families, those who are of low and 
middle income. That is pillar 1. 
Pillar 2 is small businesses, and I 
think there is huge agreement on this. 
Small businesses are the engine of the 
American economy, the employer of 
first resort for Americans. Yet those 
small businesses—including nonprofits, 
cultural, and service organizations— 
have significant challenges, and we 
need to get them through this tough 
time. If we get them through the tough 
time, primarily with loans and then if 
we come out of this public health chal-
lenge into a challenged economy and 
they just have more debt on their 
books, we are not really going to help 
them. So the small business pillar of 
this is very important in order to get 
them through this challenging time 
and to do it in a way that does not just 
saddle these small businesses with 
more debt. 
The third is the large business and 
industry sectors. Of course, we need to 
provide protection for them. That is 
not the issue. Frankly, the issue is not 
even, really, the amount of the protec-
tion that must be provided. It must be 
significant. 
However, 
we 
learned 
through the stimulus package in 2009 
and through the tax bill in 2017 that 
dollars given without conditions to 
many of the large businesses can be 
spent in very economically unproduc-
tive ways, so it is important to get 
those details right. There are limits on 
using these Federal funds for executive 
compensation. There are limits on 
using the funds for stock buybacks. We 
can get the details right so that the 
dollars that are provided to our large 
industry sectors and businesses are 
used to protect their employees. 
As for States and local governments, 
we are all on the phone with our Gov-
ernors and with our mayors and with 
county health officials. We have all 
watched them close down school sys-
tems, close down universities, deal 
with extra healthcare challenges, and 
deal with skyrocketing unemployment 
insurance applications in every juris-
diction in the country. We should pro-
vide them with the resources to deal 
with those challenges. 
My hope as a former Governor—and 
we have other former Governors in the 
Chamber—is that, when we provide as-
sistance to State and local govern-
ments, we will do it in a way with max-
imum flexibility so they can use those 
funds in ways they see fit to meet the 
local needs they have experienced. 
The last pillar is the key, important 
one—I will close here, and this is to 
continue my colleague from Colorado’s 
passion and plea on behalf of our 
healthcare industry—which is the ap-
propriate level of resources to our 
healthcare infrastructure. There won’t 
be any amount of economic stimulus 
that will work if we don’t handle the 
public health crisis in a very smart 
way going forward. We could make it $3 
trillion, or we could make it $4 trillion, 
but we would be pouring the money 
away if we were not to get the public 
health crisis right. If we get it right, 
that will be the single most important 
thing toward restarting the economy. 
So the last pillar of the five pillars 
that we are spending time on is in the 
support 
for 
hospitals, 
community 
health centers, other health clinics, 
healthcare 
professionals, 
and 
sup-
porting childcare for them. We have to 
keep our frontline healthcare workers 
at work, but many of them have chil-
dren in schools that have now been 
closed. We don’t want them having to 
stay home with their kids because 
there is no childcare when we want 
them at hospitals and clinics. So part 
of that fifth pillar has to be to protect 
these healthcare workers, not only 
their physical health but their ability 
to go to work every day. 
I believe we are close on the negotia-
tion. I don’t like watching stem-wind-
ing speeches from the floor, blaming 
who one thinks is responsible for not 
being able to pass a vote, when I know, 
20 yards away, the White House is sit-
ting down with the Democrats, and we 
are getting closer and closer and closer 
to coming up with a package that can 
gain bipartisan acceptance as it should. 
The American public needs action. 
The American public needs big action. 
But if we are going to spend $2 tril-
lion and we spend it the wrong way, we 
will regret it for years. If we spend it 
the right way, we could get through 
this crisis in a way that will do min-
imum damage to our economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina). The Senator 
from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, first let 
me say thank you to my colleague, the 
former Governor of Virginia, the Sen-
ator from Virginia now. As a former 
Governor, we have a real interest in 
making sure that there is a good, coop-
erative spirit between the Federal Gov-
ernment and State governments. 
But this evening, as we have gone 
through an entire day—which is rather 
unusual in the Senate to have one Sen-
ator speaking after another with oth-
ers here—at a time in which we should 
be exercising separation, as they say, 
to have had so many colleagues on the 
floor shows just how seriously the U.S. 
Senate is taking this issue. 
Perhaps the frustration laid out by 
Members of my conference is that we 
really want this to move forward as 
quickly as possible, and we understand 
that it is very difficult to put together 
the resources in order to buy those ad-
ditional pieces of equipment that our 
friend from Colorado laid out unless we 
have a long-term plan here in which to 
also pay for it. 
So what I would like to do is to share 
a little bit of what is in this just in 
terms of a summary of what is in the 
proposal right now and that we believe 
is an appropriate, major step in taking 
care of funding to respond not just to 
the medical emergency but also to the 
economic emergency that we have in 
front of us right now for men and 
women who are worried about where 
they are going to get the next pay-
check. 
First of all, under the appropriations 
section, we have $75 billion for hos-
pitals that is included in the proposal; 
$20 billion additional for veterans’ 
health that is included; $11 billion 
more 
for 
vaccines, 
therapeutics, 
diagnostics 
and 
other 
preparedness 
needs. 
There is an additional $4.5 billion for 
the CDC—the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, or CDC. The reason we have put 
that in there is we want to be ahead of 
the game when it comes to making 
sure they have the resources to take 
care of the emergency needs that we 
know are showing up right now. 
There is also an additional $1.7 bil-
lion to add new medical equipment to 
the strategic national stockpile. As my 
colleague 
from 
Colorado 
was 
sug-
gesting, this is an area where we need 
to beef it up, and we need to be able to 
provide 
that 
additional 
equipment. 
That is included in this bill that, right 
now, has been here for 2 days. 
Also, we understand that at the State 
level there are other needs as well. 
There is $20 billion in here for public 
transportation emergency relief. There 
is $10 billion built into the bill right 
now for block grants to the States. 
That is the broadest type of resources 
that we provide to the States today. 
There is an additional $5 billion to be 
added to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. 
Remember that FEMA is now at a level 
1, which is basically their highest level. 
They are coordinating now on a 24-hour 
basis with every single State in the Na-
tion directly, back and forth, to pro-
vide an avenue of communication and

logistics so that when parts are found 
or equipment is found in one area, it 
can be coordinated to get to an area 
where it is needed—not so much be-
cause we always have all the supplies 
that we need available right now but 
because we want the supplies that we 
do have to get to where they are need-
ed as quickly as possible. That is in op-
eration today. 
Now, there are other pieces to this 
that are also really important. One of 
the reasons you have seen the frustra-
tion on the Republican side of this dis-
cussion is that there are men and 
women right now who don’t have a pay-
check coming in; they have been laid 
off through no fault of their own. They 
are being laid off because of COVID–19 
and because their businesses have been 
asked—or in some cases, directed—to 
close. And when that happens, we feel 
an obligation to try to at least allow 
them the opportunity to make it 
through the next few months, to get 
ready for the recovery that we are con-
vinced can happen if we properly man-
age the emergency before us. 
I would like to just go through them 
briefly so that after an entire day of 
discussion, there is at least an under-
standing of what is in the bill today 
just for men and women who are hurt-
ing today. 
On a per-person basis, we are offering 
about $250 billion in additional re-
sources. For a child, there is $500 for 
every child in a family, but that is on 
top of $1,200 for a mother and a father. 
What we are suggesting with that is, it 
doesn’t mean that you have to have 
made that much. This is a refundable 
tax credit, and it is available to indi-
viduals regardless of if they even made 
that much or paid taxes on that in the 
last couple of years. 
This is really important because this 
is an immediate, upfront payment from 
the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, 
back to individuals. And the sooner we 
pass this legislation, the sooner those 
dollars can get out to people who, right 
now, are hurting, and they need this 
additional assistance at this time, not 
a month and a half or 2 months from 
now, but as soon as we can get it to 
them. 
Additionally, we have an unemploy-
ment 
proposal 
that 
increases 
the 
amount of money that goes into the 
unemployment funds in the amount of 
about $250 billion as well. 
How does that break out and what 
does that mean to an individual? If an 
individual is on unemployment today, 
what we are offering, besides what they 
are getting from the State is, first of 
all, first dollar coverage with no 1- 
week wait period. Second of all, we are 
adding an additional $600 per week—per 
week—for the first 9 weeks that they 
are eligible for. 
Now, that doesn’t mean that unem-
ployment stops at that point, but there 
is $600 additional during that 9-week 
period of time. This is very important 
for individuals who have no place else 
to go and have already been laid off of 
work because we have told those busi-
nesses that they have to shut down. 
Another piece of this product right 
now I think is an excellent piece, one 
that not only offers emotional support 
for men and women who are struggling, 
but it also shares through small busi-
nesses an amount—about $350 billion— 
that goes to small businesses, busi-
nesses that are under—that are under— 
500 employees in size. When we define 
an employee, we are talking about an 
FTE or full-time equivalent of 40 
hours. So if you have two half-times, 
you have one FTE. 
But what we have offered to small 
businesses in this is a very simple loan 
and loan forgiveness program for which 
they can go down to their local lender 
and apply. The local lender is the per-
son who puts the papers together and 
so forth, but what it allows them to do 
is to go down and say: Look, I have just 
been told that my business is shut 
down. I don’t want to lose my employ-
ees. What they can do is borrow the 
money to continue to pay the payroll 
and benefits for those individuals they 
would be laying off otherwise. And if 
they keep them on for a period of up to 
8 weeks, we forgive the loan. It be-
comes a grant. But the reason for that 
is if we don’t do that, those same indi-
viduals are going to be on the unem-
ployment rolls, so why make them go 
through that emotional distress and 
why have them in such a position that 
they may not get the benefits back 
that the small business is offering 
today. 
We have done something else as well. 
We have said for that small business 
owner: We know many of you have 
mortgages; you have ongoing pay-
ments. So we will also let you include 
your mortgage payments, as well, and 
your ongoing rent, lights, and so forth. 
And if you keep open, you can also 
apply to have that part forgiven, as 
well, up to a grand total of $10 million 
per business. Why? Because we want 
stability in the marketplace, and we 
think that is what a lot of employees 
want. 
We would like to have that out this 
week. That is one of the reasons you 
see the frustrations and the irritation 
on the Republican side of the aisle 
here—because we really thought we 
were negotiating on these items in 
good faith with Members of the other 
side in working groups that had both 
included in such a fashion that we 
could move through this fairly quickly. 
In fact, I think you have heard Mem-
bers on the other side of the aisle talk 
about the fact that they are not dis-
agreeing with those things. 
There is another part too. There are 
the larger businesses, over 500 in size. 
When we have businesses that are big-
ger than 500 in size, what we have said 
is: Look, we are not going to give you 
a grant program. We are not going to 
be in the position of bailing you out. 
But what we do want to do is to make 
liquidity and loans available to you— 
loans that you can afford. 
We are going to ask for some condi-
tions on that, yes, but the idea here is 
to allow them to survive and to be 
ready to go back into business. 
This seems to be the place where we 
have the most dissension and disagree-
ment between the two parties because, 
while we are proposing that they can’t 
use this to buy stock back, I think 
some of our Democratic colleagues 
thought we had to strengthen it. Fine. 
That shouldn’t take 2 days to work 
out. They think we should have some 
more 
guidelines. 
Fine. 
But 
that 
shouldn’t take 2 days to work out. 
The goal here is to keep as many peo-
ple employed and to keep those busi-
nesses operational so that as we move 
through this health emergency, those 
businesses continue to do business in 
the future. 
There is a larger portion in this that 
we also talk about, which is for the air-
lines and so forth. We have a frustra-
tion, as well, with our Democratic col-
leagues because of some of the sugges-
tions that have been made. We don’t 
think they should have to remake their 
board of directors if they are going to 
get a loan. 
We think the airlines are critical— 
not just to save the airlines but be-
cause business relies on airlines and 
people rely on airlines now to get from 
one place to another throughout the 
United States. 
We have also included about $17 bil-
lion to take care of those separate in-
dustries on which we have national de-
fense-specific issues. We think this has 
been well thought out. 
It doesn’t mean that there isn’t room 
for more negotiations, but time is of 
the essence. As we sit here this 
evening, more people will die; more 
people will get sick; more men and 
women will find themselves wondering 
where they are going to get their next 
paycheck. Every single day matters. 
So our request to the Members on the 
other side of the aisle, who have twice 
now said ‘‘No, we don’t want to take 
the first procedural step to get onto 
the bill,’’ what we say is: Look, you 
have to push hard on your leadership to 
come to a consensus. And, please, this 
is emergency legislation. This should 
not be a Christmas tree. It should not 
be a piece of legislation that, since it 
needs to pass, we can now put a wish 
list of other things that one party or 
the other has been trying to get into 
law but does not have consensus on. 
This is where the areas of contention 
are this evening. 
So to the men and women who are 
out there and are concerned, I can 
share with you that I think we have a 
very good plan, one that will come 
close to $1.9 trillion dollars in terms of 
what we are offering. But at the same 
time, it needs to get out as quickly as 
possible, and it has to be as simple as 
possible for those men and women to be 
able to apply for in an unemployment 
line or the businesses to apply through 
a local bank so that they can keep peo-
ple employed or for that larger busi-
ness to understand that liquidity is

available to get them through a very 
difficult time, but it is not going to be 
a grant; it is going to be a loan. 
Finally, there is an area which is im-
portant that perhaps can have some ad-
ditional thought put into it, and that is 
that not just the hospitals at the local 
level need our support and our assist-
ance right now because they can’t do 
this by themselves, but we are going to 
find that State after State is going to 
be knocking on our door, saying: You 
shut down businesses in our State. You 
have told us that we need to in order to 
quell this emergency, but in doing so, 
the revenues that were generated be-
cause of those business activities we 
don’t have. 
So you are going to find State reve-
nues that are down significantly, and 
they are going to be coming in, and 
they are going to be visiting. I am con-
vinced that between this package and 
perhaps the next package we have to 
also recognize the impact to State gov-
ernments that provide so many of the 
services that men and women rely on 
on a daily basis. 
So I would like to thank you for your 
time, Mr. President. I think this is im-
portant, and I think the message that 
we have to have as responsible individ-
uals, Members of this body in which 
today we truly did have debate and dis-
cussion on the floor—we have to finish 
this, and we have to do it in such a 
fashion that it reaches men and women 
who are counting on us as soon as pos-
sible. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. PERDUE submitted the fol-

to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 550 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
has created an unprecedented health crisis 
that has caused significant economic risks 
and harm to the well-being of the United 
States; 
Whereas the United States is racing to ad-
dress the uncertainty caused by that crisis 
while ensuring that people have access to 
critical care and the essential items they 
need; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, the Department of 
Homeland Security, other Federal agencies, 
and State and local governments are tire-
lessly leading the United States through 
that unprecedented crisis; 
Whereas health workers are on the front 
lines leading the charge to solve the crisis, 
flatten the curve, and protect the United 
States; 
Whereas first responders show bravery and 
courage by putting themselves at risk while 
providing critical care to those who have 
COVID–19 and other infectious diseases and 
conditions; 
Whereas the brave members of the Na-
tional Guard are always ready and always 
available to respond in times of need; 
Whereas truck drivers, delivery persons, 
airline workers, and supply chain specialists 
are transporting critical medical goods be-
tween hospitals, essential items to stores, 
and food and delivered goods to the homes of 
people throughout the United States; 
Whereas the energy industry is helping the 
United States by providing the power nec-
essary for hospitals, governments, and busi-
nesses to work day and night responding to 
the crisis; 
Whereas farmers and grocery store workers 
are feeding communities and helping fami-
lies across the United States put food on the 
table; 
Whereas educators in the United States 
have adapted quickly to distance and online 
teaching and continue to provide the chil-
dren of the United States with a high-quality 
education under uncertain circumstances; 
and 
Whereas janitorial-services businesses and 
staff are keeping buildings and businesses 
across the United States safe by providing 
the critical cleaning services necessary to

necessary additional shares cannot be ob-
tained.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RENTAL 
EVICTION MORATORIUM ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 23, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Rental Eviction 
Moratorium Act along with my colleague, BAR-
BARA LEE. 
No one should lose their home because of 
this public health crisis. That’s why I’m intro-
ducing this bill, which will prohibit the eviction 
of rental tenants for the duration of the 
COVID–19 public health emergency. 
This bill prohibits landlords from initiating 
eviction proceedings due to a tenants’ failure 
to pay rent or other causes, and sunsets 6 
months after FEMA terminates the emergency 
declared by the President. 
More than a third of U.S. residents rent their 
homes, and that proportion is even higher in 
communities I represent in Chicago. As busi-
ness closures, reduced hours and layoffs in-
crease throughout the country, working class 
people, immigrants and people of color are 
hardest hit and many will miss rent payments. 
But when our public health officials are telling 
us all to stay home, this common-sense bill 
will ensure that more people can do so even 
as we enter into what may be a deep reces-
sion. 
I urge this body to advance this legislation. 
SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4,
