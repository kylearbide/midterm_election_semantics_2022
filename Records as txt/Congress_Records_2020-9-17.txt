QUINTIN WASHINGTON 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, 
good local journalism builds the foun-
dation of a strong community. In the 
Lowcountry, we are blessed with some 
fantastic journalists, and I would like 
to 
highlight 
one 
of 
them 
today: 
Quintin Washington. 
Through his independent web series, 
called Quintin’s Close Ups, Quintin has 
kept his finger on the pulse of our com-
munity by doing literally thousands of 
interviews with the Lowcountry’s most 
influential people. From Presidential 
candidates to Members of Congress to 
business officials, you would be hard 
pressed to find an elected official in 
South Carolina who has not sat down 
with Quintin on camera. 
Mr. Speaker, Quintin doesn’t do this 
for money or notoriety, but a genuine 
love for our community and a desire to 
make sure that everyone is informed. 
His interviews are invaluable to the 
Lowcountry, and we are incredibly 
grateful for his service. 
I know that I speak for everyone in 
the Lowcountry when I wish Quintin 
Washington many more years of first- 
class journalism. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MARK 
SERTICH 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mark 
Sertich. 
A hockey legend and leader in the 
Duluth community, Mark passed away 
last month at 99 years old. 
Upon 
graduation 
from 
Duluth’s 
Denfeld High School in 1939, Mark 
served his country in World War II as a 
radio operator under General Patton. 
When he returned home from the war, 
Mark dedicated his time and efforts 
into growing the game of hockey in the 
Duluth community because he knew 
the true power of hockey was its abil-
ity to bring people together. 
Mark helped build hockey rinks, 
coached youth teams, and served as the 
head of the Duluth Amateur Hockey 
Association—all helping to ensure his 
passion would pass down to the next 
generation. 
Mark’s love for the game of hockey 
lasted his entire life. In fact, he holds 
the Guinness World Record as the old-
est hockey player, and he continued to 
play with my former colleagues in the 
Duluth Fire Department for over 30 
years. I had the great honor of playing

with Mark during some of those games, 
and I am thankful to everyone at the 
Fire 
Department 
who 
made 
those 
games possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I know that Mark 
Sertich is already missed by his family, 
friends, and all of the Duluth commu-
nity, but I hope they are comforted in 
knowing that his life as a hockey leg-
end, community leader, World War II 
veteran and a member of the greatest 
generation will be long remembered 
and celebrated. 
f 
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES 
(Ms. ESHOO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, it is won-
derful to see the gentleman in the 
Chair. 
Mr. Speaker and colleagues, a month 
ago yesterday, a siege of lightning 
strikes ignited the CZU Lightning 
Complex fire in my congressional dis-
trict, and it is now the 10th most de-
structive wildlife in California’s his-
tory. 
Over the past month, the fire has de-
stroyed nearly a thousand homes in my 
district and forced 77,000 of my con-
stituents to evacuate. Thanks to the 
extraordinary—and I mean, extraor-
dinary work—of thousands of first re-
sponders, the fire is now over 90 per-
cent contained. 
As we work toward recovery, much of 
the Bay Area and the entire western 
United States is still breathing the 
toxic smoke from these fires, which 
can have lasting effects and worsen 
chronic heart and lung diseases and 
have a terrible impact on children 
whose lungs are still developing. 
Congress should immediately pass 
my legislation, the Smoke Planning 
and Research Act to help local govern-
ments address this public health crisis. 
I am also calling on Congress to pass 
the WIRED Act to allow States to re-
quire wireless companies to deploy in-
frastructure that is resilient enough to 
support cell phone networks during dis-
asters. 
f 
NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION 
DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize 
tomorrow, September 18, as National 
POW/MIA Recognition Day. 
This important day of respect, reflec-
tion, and recognition was established 
through a 1979 proclamation by Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter. To date, more than 
83,000 Americans are still missing from 
World War II, the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, and more. 
The brave Americans who rose to the 
occasion to protect and defend our 
country are the bravest among us. 
Many return home. Far too many do 
not. We owe it to those individuals and 
to the families of those individuals to 
continue the search. The pain that 
these families endure due to uncer-
tainty is unfathomable. 
To ensure that these men and women 
are never forgotten, a flag, that I am 
sure all of us recognize, was designed in 
consultation with Evelyn Grubb, wife 
of an Air Force POW, and Mary Helen 
Hoff, wife of a Navy man deemed miss-
ing in action. 
Today, that flag is displayed in the 
U.S. Capitol rotunda, serving as a re-
minder that we must continue our 
work on behalf of military families and 
continue the search for our POW/MIA 
servicemembers. 
f 
HEROES ACT FOR THE PEOPLE 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, nearly 200,000 
Americans have tragically died from 
COVID–19 in the United States. In Riv-
erside County, California, 1,136 have 
died and 56,201 people have been in-
fected. 
We have record-breaking unemploy-
ment in our Nation, with 13.7 percent 
unemployment in Riverside County. 
They are our family, our neighbors, 
our friends. My constituents are strug-
gling, and they urgently need relief. 
The Senate must get their act to-
gether. Their delay in stalling is a 
shame, and to make matters worse, 
their skinny-aid excuse of a proposal is 
much worse than a day late and a dol-
lar short. 
In fact, it has been 125 days since the 
House passed the HEROES Act. They 
must meet the HEROES Act at least 
halfway to provide another round of 
stimulus checks, extend unemploy-
ment benefits, small business support, 
and money for local and State govern-
ments to pay for essential services, 
like for police, firefighters, and teach-
ers. 
The Senate must act. The Senate 
must step up and bring this legislation 
for a vote. Meet us halfway to slow the 
spread and save lives as quickly and 
safely as possible. We need the HE-
ROES Act for the people. 
f 
ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, for our 
friends and allies in Israel, the Abra-
ham Accords are the first agreement 
with a neighboring Arab country since 
1994. Peace agreements between Israel, 
Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates 
bring a significant shift in the balance 
of power in the Middle East, and 
strengthens 
the 
American 
position 
against Iran, which is a leading sponsor 
of terror in the world. 
Thanks to President Trump’s bold vi-
sion for American foreign policy, we 
have rebuilt trust with our regional 
partners and show a united front 
against 
the 
oppressive 
regime 
in 
Tehran. 
After decades of division in the Mid-
dle East, the Abraham Accords will lay 
the foundation for peace and prosperity 
in the region for decades to come. Nor-
malized relations across the region will 
accelerate growth by expanding diplo-
matic, economic, and financial ties. 
Mr. Speaker, there is much to be op-
timistic about, these recent historic 
Abraham Accords will bring a new 
wave of peace and prosperity in the 
Middle East. 
f 
HEROES ACT AND THE PEOPLE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, more 
than 4 months ago, the House passed 
the HEROES Act, legislation that pro-
tects our HEROES on the front line of 
this pandemic, our police officers, fire-
fighters, healthcare workers, sanita-
tion workers, it provides stimulus pay-
ments for up to $6,000 per family, ex-
tends unemployment benefits of $600 
per week through January, and gets 
hazard pay and much-needed resources 
to frontline workers. 
This bill has sat on my MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s desk since then. 
In the meantime, tens of millions of 
Americans are out of work with unem-
ployment levels four times higher than 
they were before this pandemic. More 
than a million layoffs and State and 
local budget cuts that are crippling 
services for those who need them the 
most. A total of 6.3 million Americans 
have been infected and nearly 200,000 
have died. 
Mr. Speaker, instead of voting on the 
HEROES Act, the Senate Republicans 
put forward their own bill that didn’t 
come close to addressing the problems 
we face: The economic catastrophe and 
the public health crisis. 
The American people deserve better. 
They need help. They deserve a Senate 
and Republicans in the Senate that 
work for them, and a President who 
tells them the truth. 
Rest assured, Democrats are going to 
continue fighting for all those that our 
Republican colleagues in the Senate 
and that President Trump have left be-
hind. 
f 
WE THE PEOPLE 
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a special day in which we pause to 
cherish the bedrock of our union that 
is the Constitution. 
The great experiment that is this Na-
tion rests upon the spirit that Madison 
enshrined in this document. It is the

unwavering commitment to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness, the 
American ethos that sustains us to this 
day. 
The essence of our democratic repub-
lic lies in the words, ‘‘We the People.’’ 
This creed is the glue that holds our 
United States together, and it ought to 
be revered. When held close, our Nation 
will continue to prosper through gen-
erations to come. As Henry Clay once 
said, ‘‘The Constitution of the United 
States was made not merely for the 
generation that then existed, but for 
posterity-unlimited, 
undefined, 
end-
less, perpetual posterity.’’ 
Unique to the world is our tireless 
belief in a better tomorrow. If we are 
to sustain this hope, we must maintain 
an enduring commitment to the ideals 
of the Constitution. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
encourage 
every 
American, young and old alike, to 
study the framework and celebrate the 
greatest Nation that this world has 
ever known. Let this day serve as a re-
minder of everything that was and ev-
erything that can be so long as we re-
main united under the articles of the 
Constitution.

CONDEMNING ANTI-ASIAN 
SENTIMENT 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H. Res. 908, condemning 
all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as re-
lated to COVID. 
I cast my ‘‘yes’’ vote today in mem-
ory of Vincent Chin. The anti-Asian 
racism and hate that led to his murder 
in Highland Park, Michigan, in my dis-
trict, is alive today, and it is what led 
to the June 9 horrific attack in 1982. 
I am proud to stand with my sister in 
service, 
the 
first 
Asian-American 
woman in the Michigan Legislature, 
State Senator Stephanie Chang, to say 
that the disgusting wave of hate 
against our Asian-American friends 
and neighbors we are witnessing in our 
country will not stand. 
In this moment, I think of one of our 
Nation’s 
greatest 
heroes, 
Detroiter 
Grace Lee Boggs. While she would be 
proud of our vote here today, she would 
remind us that our work is not done. 
We must commit, as she did for over 
100 years, to the revolutionary struggle 
to liberate our world from hate, em-
brace all humankind with love, and 
grow our own souls in the process. 
I thank so much Congresswoman 
MENG for her leadership, and I urge my 
colleagues to please vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
f 
SUPPORTING HYPERBARIC 
OXYGEN THERAPY FOR VETERANS 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to bring impor-
tance to a treatment issue that faces 
our Nation’s veterans suffering from 
traumatic brain injury, TBI, and post- 
traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. 
In line with National Suicide Preven-
tion Month, I am introducing the Vet-
erans National Traumatic Brain Injury 
Treatment Act today. This bill will 
help so many of our veterans who are 
suffering from TBI and PTSD by cre-
ating a pilot program, increasing their 
access to hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 
HBOT. There are presently many treat-
ments for PTSD and TBI, but they do 
not work for everyone. 
As a physician for over 30 years, I 
have long been a strong advocate for 
HBOT, since I was in the North Caro-
lina legislature. This type of treatment 
has restored the lives of so many of our 
veterans when all else failed. But the 
Department of Veterans Affairs has re-
fused to use this treatment despite 
many requests by Members of Con-
gress. 
This is a bipartisan issue. It is time 
for Congress to authorize this treat-
ment option by the Department of Vet-
erans 
Affairs. 
Charitable 
organiza-
tions—donations, not taxpayer funds— 
will pay for this program. My pilot pro-
gram should show how efficacious this 
treatment truly is. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, as we owe our veterans and 
their families this treatment option for 
those who have lost all hope to help 
their lives return to some sense of nor-
malcy.

CONDEMNING 
ALL 
FORMS 
OF 
ANTI-ASIAN SENTIMENT AS RE-
LATED TO COVID–19 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 1107, I call 
up the resolution (H. Res. 908) con-
demning all forms of anti-Asian senti-
ment as related to COVID–19, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1107, the resolution is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 908 
Whereas 23,000,000 Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the 
Nation’s population in the United States; 
Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders are working on the 
frontlines of this COVID–19 pandemic in 
health care, law enforcement, first respond-
ers, transportation, supermarkets, and other 
service industries; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the 
‘‘Chinese 
Virus’’, 
‘‘Wuhan 
Virus’’, 
and 
‘‘Kung-flu’’ 
have 
perpetuated 
anti-Asian 
stigma; 
Whereas since January 2020, there has been 
a dramatic increase in reports of hate crimes 
and incidents against those of Asian descent; 
Whereas according to a recent study, there 
were over 400 cases related to COVID-19 anti- 
Asian discrimination between February 9, 
2020, and March 7, 2020; 
Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian 
rhetoric has resulted in Asian Americans 
being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated 
for the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas in March 2020, anti-Asian violence 
includes: a woman wearing a mask was 
kicked and punched at a New York City sub-
way station; two children and two adults 
were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in Mid-
land, Texas; a couple was assaulted and 
robbed by a group of attackers in Philadel-
phia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the 
hospital after being attacked by bullies in 
Los Angeles, California; 
Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian 
rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American 
businesses being targeted for vandalism; 
Whereas there are approximately 2 million 
Asian American-owned businesses that gen-
erate over $700 billion in annual revenue and 
employ nearly 4.5 million workers; 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
(WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) recognize that naming 
COVID–19 by its geographic location or link-
ing it to a specific ethnicity perpetuates 
stigma; 
Whereas in 2015, the WHO issued guidance 
calling on media outlets, scientists, and na-
tional authorities to avoid naming infectious 
diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing 
groups of people; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services stated 
‘‘ethnicity is not what causes the novel 
coronavirus’’ and that it is inappropriate and 
inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ‘‘Chinese 
virus’’; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch 
Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC 
said, ‘‘Stigma is the enemy of public 
health’’; 
Whereas, on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert 
Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified 
that use of the term ‘‘Chinese coronavirus’’ 
is wrong and inappropriate; and 
Whereas the Secretary General of the 
United Nations called for international soli-
darity and an end to any ill-founded dis-
crimination of the outbreak’s victims: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on all public officials to condemn 
and denounce any and all anti-Asian senti-
ment in any form; 
(2) recognizes that the health and safety of 
all Americans, no matter their background, 
must be of utmost priority; 
(3) condemns all manifestations of expres-
sions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, 
anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and eth-
nic or religious intolerance; 
(4) calls on Federal law enforcement offi-
cials, working with State and local offi-
cials— 
(A) to expeditiously investigate and docu-
ment all credible reports of hate crimes and 
incidents and threats against the Asian- 
American community in the United States; 
(B) to collect data to document the rise of 
incidences of hate crimes due to COVID–19; 
and 
(C) to hold the perpetrators of those 
crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and 
bring such perpetrators to justice; and 
(5) recommits United States leadership in 
building more inclusive, diverse, and toler-
ant societies— 
(A) to prioritize language access and 
inclusivity in communication practices; and 
(B) to combat misinformation and dis-
crimination that put Asian Americans at 
risk.

olution shall be debatable for 1 hour,

chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
908. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H. Res. 908, a resolution con-
demning all forms of anti-Asian senti-
ment as related to COVID–19. 
Among other things, the resolution, 
introduced by my colleague from New 
York, Representative GRACE
MENG, 
calls upon all public officials to con-
demn and denounce anti-Asian senti-
ment, and it calls on Federal law en-
forcement officials to investigate and 
document all credible reports of hate 
crimes against Asian Americans, to 
collect data on the rise of hate crimes 
incidents due to COVID–19, and to hold 
perpetrators accountable. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is an ongo-
ing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 mil-
lion Americans have been infected, and 
almost 200,000 have died from COVID– 
19. It has upended the lives of almost 
every American in some way, and it 
will continue to do so for some time as 
we brace for a potential second wave of 
infections. 
On top of bearing the burdens that 
the pandemic has imposed on all Amer-
icans, Asian Americans have been 
forced to carry the added anxiety of 
confronting racial prejudice, including 
racially motivated harassment and vio-
lence stemming from the stigma that 
has unfairly associated them with 
COVID–19 because of the virus’ origin 
in China, a stigma that has been rein-
forced by rhetoric suggesting such a 
link. 
According to the Asian Pacific Policy 
and Planning Council, since March 19, 
there have been almost 2,600 cases of 
anti-Asian discrimination related to 
COVID–19. 
According to the resolution, at the 
pandemic’s earliest stage in this coun-
try, between February 9 and March 7, 
there were over 400 such incidents. 
These include the stabbings of an 
Asian-American father and two young 
children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas. 
Public health entities, including the 
World Health Organization and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, have recognized that labeling 
a virus by geographic or ethnic terms 
unfairly stigmatizes certain commu-
nities and ultimately harms public 
health. For this reason, Secretary of 
Health and Human Services Alex Azar 
rightly condemned the use of the 
phrase ‘‘Chinese virus’’ in testimony 
before the Ways and Means Committee, 
stating that: ‘‘Ethnicity it is not what 
causes the novel coronavirus.’’ 
It is incumbent on all public figures, 
including elected officials like us, to 
publicly condemn bigotry and the stig-
matization of racial or ethnic groups 
unfairly targeted for blame. We must 
speak out clearly against such atti-
tudes and acts of hate whenever they 
occur, but particularly in the face of 
public panic or fear during a national 
emergency, when society can be espe-
cially vulnerable to racist appeals and 
prejudices. 
While many public figures have ad-
mirably sought to end COVID–19-re-
lated animosity, some, unfortunately, 
appear not to share the same sense of 
moral duty. Rather than using their 
bully pulpits to confront prejudice and 
racial hatred, they have instead chosen 
repeatedly to use derogatory and preju-
dicial phrases and remarks, reinforcing 
the exclusion and stigmatization of 
Asian Americans in the face of a na-
tional crisis, a tactic that sadly has a 
long and ugly history in our country. 
Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric 
has, in the past, led to grave injustices 
like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the 
internment of Japanese Americans dur-
ing World War II. 
In the year 2020, condemning bigotry 
and racial scapegoating should not be 
hard for any Member of this House to 
do. It is long past time to leave the 
days of yellow peril hysteria and un-
justified blame of the other behind. 
The House can take an important 
step in that direction by passing H. 
Res. 908 unanimously. I urge strong 
support for this resolution, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, we 
oppose 
this 
legislation. 
Everyone 
knows racism is wrong, but that is not 
what this legislation is about. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS). 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, let’s be clear. There is no de-
nying where the virus originated. It 
was China. 
There is no denying the Chinese Com-
munist Party has done everything in 
its power to cover up their role in the 
ongoing pandemic, intentionally mis-
leading the global community and forc-
ing their friends in the World Health 
Organization to do their bidding. 
That being said, how is that Demo-
crats are still refusing to acknowledge 
China’s role in the coronavirus pan-
demic? Just recently, a Chinese virol-
ogist 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
coronavirus was released from a Chi-
nese lab in Wuhan. Are we just to pre-
tend that didn’t exist or is not even a 
possibility? 
It seems like the route the Demo-
crats would like us to take is to pre-
tend that the Communists in China ab-
solutely played no role in the global 
pandemic and blame it all on the Presi-
dent. 
To be clear, Madam Speaker, all 
forms of racism and discrimination are 
abhorrent, including anti-Asian senti-
ment. If that is what we were talking 
about today, that would be even better. 
But this is not what we are talking 
about today. 
The underlying tone, even from the 
chairman, is discussing how we deal 
with this in words. I have stood on this 
floor several times over the past year- 
and-a-half in denouncing all forms of 
hatred on both sides. 
But let’s be honest. That is not what 
this bill is really about. This bill is ex-
actly what this entire Congress has 
been about the entire time: Democrats 
ignoring the real issues plaguing Amer-
icans, just for the opportunity to criti-
cize President Trump. 
Despite their overwhelming failure 
to undermine the Trump administra-
tion through the Russian collusion 
hoax and the sham impeachment, the 
Democratic playbook has not changed 
at all. 
Now, a little over 6 weeks from the 
election, Democrats are leaning on the 
global crisis to continue their admoni-
tions, all at the expense of American 
families and businesses desperate for 
relief. 
Democrats have taken no issue in ig-
noring the coronavirus’ effects on the 
ground in favor of criticizing the Presi-
dent, and no criticism is more dynamic 
than their collective offense at Presi-
dent Trump calling the virus the 
‘‘China virus’’ or the ‘‘Wuhan virus.’’ 
Democrats would love for the Amer-
ican people to forget the work that the 
administration has done to tackle the 
virus, including shutting down travel 
for China in the early days of the virus. 
Instead of applauding the move, Demo-
crats and Joe Biden accused the Trump 
administration and President Trump of 
fanning the flames of hate, fear, and 
xenophobia, when his actual actions 
kept others from getting it and kept it 
from spreading because it was coming 
from China. 
For the last 3 years, Democrats have 
repeatedly claimed that Russia must 
have something on Donald Trump. The 
real question is, frankly, during a pres-
idential election, what does the Chi-
nese Communist Party have on Joe 
Biden? 
Democrats would also love for the 
American people to forget that many 
viruses are named for where they origi-
nated. Take the Spanish flu, the Middle 
East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and 
German measles. Because the Demo-
crats seem to be so bankrupt on this 
floor of bringing bills and real solu-
tions forward, maybe the next 2 weeks 
we are up here, we are going to have 
one on the German measles and the 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. 
That is all we are doing, wasting the 
people’s time with this right here. If 
you want to work on politics, go out-
side the Capitol, not here on the floor 
of this House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4497 
September 17, 2020 
President Trump and Republicans 
have made it clear where the blame of 
this virus begins. It begins and ends 
with the Chinese Communist Party and 
their refusal to acknowledge the prob-
lem they had and let it go into all the 
world. Refusing to acknowledge that 
fact is wrong, and failing to address it 
in the House, in favor of political mes-
saging bills like this, is nothing more 
than political attempts to take down 
this President. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, last 
March, as the COVID–19 pandemic first 
began to affect our day-to-day lives, 
the FBI warned that we could soon see 
a 
rise 
in 
hate 
crimes 
committed 
against Asian Americans. 
In this moment, President Trump 
could have tried to bring Americans to-
gether. That is not the path he chose. 
Instead, the President has poured 
gasoline on the fire, using terms like 
‘‘kung flu’’ and ‘‘China virus.’’ The 
White House has stoked racial tensions 
and fed into our country’s worst 
xenophobic impulses. 
From March until June of this year, 
our country saw more than 2,100 re-
ported hate crimes targeting Asian 
Americans. More than 3 in 10 Asian 
Americans now say that they have 
been the subject of slurs or racist jokes 
since the start of this pandemic. 
These slurs and jokes aren’t just 
words. They are actions designed to 
make Asian Americans feel less than 
equal, and they have no place in this 
country. But that is the reality of life 
in Donald Trump’s America. 
This administration has tried to turn 
back the clock on racial equality. This 
administration has demeaned, belit-
tled, and ostracized nearly every mi-
nority community. 
Today, the House is saying no more. 
We will not stand by as this adminis-
tration attacks innocent men, women, 
and children of Asian descent. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this excellent resolution. 
b 0930 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I was 
hopeful that this resolution would lead 
us to common ground. None of us here 
believes in discriminating against our 
fellow Asian-American neighbors. 
On March 23, President Trump said 
the Asian-American community ought 
to be ‘‘totally protected’’ in light of 
the xenophobic attacks during the 
coronavirus pandemic. ‘‘It is very im-
portant that we totally protect our 
Asian-American 
community 
in 
the 
United States and all around the 
world,’’ President Trump tweeted. 
‘‘They’re amazing people, and the 
spreading of the virus is not their fault 
in any way, shape, or form,’’ he said. 
‘‘They’re working closely with us to 
get rid of it,’’ the President added. ‘‘We 
will prevail together.’’ 
I have restauranteurs in my district 
who suffered from bullies because of 
their heritage, so I asked my staff to 
prepare a resolution to echo the Presi-
dent’s sentiments. My staff reported to 
me that such a resolution already ex-
isted, H. Res. 908, ostensibly to protect 
Asian Americans. 
On April 7, I signed onto what I con-
sidered to be a good faith effort to pro-
tect Asian Americans. I am more than 
saddened to see that this resolution 
and today’s debate is being used for 
nothing more than to malign and vilify 
the President of the United States, just 
as the President and congressional Re-
publicans have been called domestic 
enemies in the last couple of days. I 
would hope for more, but, sadly, this 
body has chosen to take the low road. 
This debate has devolved into finger- 
pointing, name-calling, and scoring po-
litical points. Rather than reaching a 
high watermark for bringing us all to-
gether, it has further ripped apart the 
fabric of America. I am deeply dis-
appointed and will not be a party to to-
day’s partisan exercise that is more 
about scoring political points than re-
building America. 
We should be working together to 
help all Americans recover, to inves-
tigate COVID–19, which has resulted in 
hundreds of thousands of deaths around 
the world, trillions lost and trillions 
more spent responding to COVID. Lives 
and dreams have been shattered. 
We have a duty to all Americans to 
find a cure, to get to the bottom of just 
how this pandemic started, and to do 
what we can to prevent it from hap-
pening ever again in the future. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise in support of H. 
Res. 908, condemning all forms of anti- 
Asian sentiment related to COVID–19. 
Since this pandemic began, there 
have been thousands and thousands of 
reports 
of 
discrimination 
and 
xenophobic 
attacks 
against 
Asian 
Americans in the United States, in-
cluding in my district, which has one 
of the highest concentrations of Asian 
Americans in the country. 
As an Asian American myself, this is 
deeply personal and offensive to me. 
When people, including those in the 
White House, refer to COVID–19 as the 
Chinese virus or the kung-flu, they en-
courage 
bigotry 
or 
discrimination 
against Asian Americans. 
To put it simply, promoting anti- 
Asian-American sentiment or anti- 
Asian sentiment as related to COVID– 
19 is un-American, which is why I am 
proud to cosponsor this resolution and 
encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, again, we all know 
racism is wrong, but that is not what 
this is about. This is just another ef-
fort of the Democrats to attack the 
President. 
The third whereas in the resolution, 
the gentlemen just spoke about this. 
The third whereas in the resolution 
says you perpetuate anti-Asian bias if 
you use the terms ‘‘Chinese virus’’ or 
‘‘Wuhan virus.’’ Well, someone should 
have told the media this. 
CNN called it the Wuhan virus. 
MSNBC 
called 
it 
the 
Chinese 
coronavirus. ABC and CBS called it 
China’s coronavirus. CNBC called it the 
China coronavirus. So someone should 
have told the media that you couldn’t 
use these terms. 
Frankly, someone should have told 
the Democrats a few months ago that a 
few months later the mob, the cancel 
culture, would say this is a term you 
can’t use, because the Democrats used 
it on their committee notice. 
In the January 29, 2020, committee 
notice, House Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee on Asia, the Pacific, and 
Nonproliferation, 
Congressman 
BARRett, the chairman, says in the sub-
ject line of the hearing for the fol-
lowing week: ‘‘Subject: The Wuhan 
coronavirus.’’ 
Someone should have told the Demo-
crats you can’t use that term, but in 
the new woke world you can’t state the 
truth. 
And as Mr. COLLINS pointed out: 
Did the virus start in China? Yes. 
Did the virus start in Wuhan, China? 
Yes. 
Did China lie to the United States 
about the severity and the origins of 
this virus? Yes. 
Did China lie to the world about the 
virus? Yes, they did. 
Did the World Health Organization 
lie to the United States? Yes, they did. 
Did the World Health Organization 
lie to the rest of the world? 
The answer to every single one of 
those questions is yes. But you can’t 
say that, not in this world, not in the 
politically correct cancel culture. You 
can’t state the truth. 
You can’t state that the Chinese 
Government launched a disinformation 
campaign to cover up its role in exacer-
bating the spread of COVID–19. 
You can’t say the coverup included 
punishing doctors, limiting the access 
of journalists, censoring the internet, 
spreading disinformation, and with-
holding information from the entire 
international community. You can’t 
say that. 
You can’t say a Chinese Government 
official publicly and falsely claimed 
that the United States Army brought 
it to Wuhan, the Chinese Government 
failed to institute a full-scale public re-
sponse, and underreporting of COVID– 
19 cases and deaths propelled the virus 
on the course that it has been on. You 
can’t say all that. You could a few 
months ago. You could have a few 
months ago, but you can’t today. That 
is the cancel culture world. That is 
how the mob operates today. 
You used to be able to say, as Mr. 
COLLINS
pointed out, the West Nile 
virus, the Zika virus, German measles, 
Spanish flu. Not today. Not today. 
They will attack you if you don’t say it

the way they want you to say it, and 
this is dangerous. You can’t say China 
virus today, and tomorrow who knows 
what it will be. 
But, like I said, a few months ago, 
even the Democrat committee chair-
man used the very term that is in their 
resolution they are saying you can’t 
use today because somehow it is anti- 
Asian bias. I think it has more to do 
with the fact that we are 7 weeks be-
fore an election, and this is one more 
way to go after the President. 
But we should all remember, this is 
dangerous when you start saying cer-
tain things can’t be said. If you don’t 
say it the way we, the politically cor-
rect, the cancel culture mob wants you 
to say it, you have to be quiet. 
Silence is the biggest threat to the 
First Amendment, and that is what we 
are seeing. And they want to just say— 
this is broader, this is bigger. 
I would say look at the sports world. 
Look at the sports world. Drew Brees 
says you should stand for the national 
anthem; he gets attacked. 
Mike Gundy, football coach at Okla-
homa State, goes fishing with his kids 
and wears what the mob says is the 
wrong T-shirt; he almost loses his job. 
He wore a T-shirt that had a conserv-
ative news outlet on the T-shirt. Oh, 
my goodness. 
You can’t coach football if you wear 
the wrong T-shirt with your kids, ac-
cording to the mob. You can’t say a 
term today that just a few months ago 
they used on their committee notice. 
You can’t say it today because that is 
what the mob says. 
James Harden says ‘‘Back the Blue’’ 
on a mask. He has to answer for that. 
Last week, two high school football 
players—on 9/11—ran on the field with 
a Back the Blue flag and a flag sup-
porting our firefighters, and they get 
suspended because today the mob says 
that is not okay. 
We need to understand the cancel 
culture restricting, limiting, telling 
you what you can and can’t say is so 
darn dangerous, and it will never stop, 
because the mob never—it never quits. 
You don’t believe me? Two weeks 
ago—2 weeks ago—the mayor of this 
city, our Nation’s Capital, has a pro-
posal to remove and relocate the Wash-
ington Monument and the Jefferson 
Memorial. This is how ridiculous—this 
is how ridiculous it gets. 
And maybe I will just finish with 
this. Maybe the most ridiculous thing 
is the last clause, the last page of their 
resolution. The last page says: ‘‘recom-
mits United States leadership in build-
ing more inclusive, diverse, and toler-
ant societies . . . to combat misin-
formation. . . .’’ 
Now, think about this for a second. If 
you state the truth, the virus started 
in China, you are a bad guy. You are 
not allowed to state the truth. This 
resolution says that is misinformation. 
The very misinformation that hap-
pened was China misinforming the 
world, lying to the world. You are not 
allowed to talk about that. You have 
to do what—this resolution says you 
have to do it the politically correct, 
the woke way, the cancel culture way, 
and that is why this is so darn wrong, 
so darn wrong. 
I hope we don’t continue to travel 
down this road. This is scary where the 
left wants to take the country, so dan-
gerous for the First Amendment and 
free speech rights. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of this resolu-
tion and in strong opposition to the 
rise of hate crimes and acts of racism 
toward Americans of Asian descent. 
We all know that these are divisive 
times. They are tough times. Hateful 
language, petty name-calling, and acts 
of violence are not the way for us to 
get through these tough times. This 
resolution allows Congress to come to-
gether to speak with one voice, that 
hate targeted at the Asian-American 
community has no place in this coun-
try and must be condemned. 
I am especially proud to speak here 
today with so many of my AAPI col-
leagues. Many of us have been the vic-
tims of these hateful and harmful ac-
tions. We have seen firsthand the vit-
riol of racism. We have felt the sting of 
the distrustful look or a harsh word. 
I hope you will join me today in ac-
knowledging the impact of racism and 
forcefully renouncing it. I hope you 
will join me here today in calling on 
unity and calling out division. And I 
hope you will join me here today in 
passing a resolution that can remind us 
that even in the darkest times we are 
strongest when we reject hate and em-
brace America’s diversity. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), the chairman of 
the Freedom Caucus. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I join in con-
demning racial discrimination of all 
kinds. It should never be tolerated. I 
wish we had the perfect society and ev-
erybody recognized everybody in a col-
orblind way, but what this bill does 
today is it doesn’t address that. 
When I heard the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee just refer to calling 
the virus that originated in China the 
Wuhan prefecture, when I heard him 
say that this is somehow equivalent to 
the Chinese Immigration Exclusion Act 
or somehow equivalent to the Japanese 
internment camp experience that we 
had where over 100,000 Japanese were 
removed from their homes and taken 
to camps, I said: This really is the 
woke culture on steroids. This has gone 
beyond. 
If this would have been a condemna-
tion of anti-Asian discrimination, I 
probably would have been right there 
signing this. I lived in northeast Asia 
for 2 years. I speak Japanese. I have 
traveled extensively in Asia. This 
doesn’t address that. What it does is 
says: You know what, we want to do 
something when we are about 6 weeks 
out from an election. That is what this 
resolution is about. You can’t tell the 
truth here. 
Let’s just recite some of the things 
we know: 
The West Nile virus, that is because 
that virus emerged from the West Nile 
district of Uganda, 1930. 
The Saint Louis encephalitis virus 
broke out around St. Louis in 1933. 
The 
Japanese 
encephalitis 
virus 
broke out in Japan in 1870. 
b 0945 
Coxsackie, New York State; Marburg, 
Germany; Hendra, Australia, all have 
viruses named after them. 
You will always have the ignorant 
who act out on racial animus. We con-
demn that. But let’s tell the truth. The 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
virus in 2012. We call that ‘‘MERS.’’ 
This week we learned from Chinese 
virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan that not 
only did this virus originate in China, 
but it may have been manufactured 
and released intentionally by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
So when the media refers to this as 
the ‘‘Wuhan virus’’ or the ‘‘China 
virus,’’ and other officials, including 
folks from this party over here, it is 
not because they have an existing rac-
ist sentiment, but it is rather to de-
scribe its origination as has been done 
historically. 
This resolution today is even more 
than a measure to appease the woke 
and tolerant and politically correct 
leftists. It is an attack on President 
Trump and all who support President 
Trump. 
It is a crying shame that you can’t 
take the actual issue that you want to 
address and address it. You have to ex-
pand it that way for political purposes. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and also for his tremendous 
leadership. And also, I acknowledge 
Representative MENG for spearheading 
this important resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H. Res. 908 to condemn all 
forms of anti-Asian hate speech related 
to COVID–19. 
Now, this pandemic is leading to an 
alarming rate of hateful speech di-
rected at people of Asian and Pacific 
Islander descent in the United States. 
And the truth is, as an African Amer-
ican, I know what hate and racism is 
and I know the violence that results. 
And the facts are: Since March, there 
have been over 2,500 reported cases of 
anti-Asian discrimination related to 
COVID–19, including over 1,100 cases in 
my home State of California. 
At the same time, by no accident or 
coincidence, the White House con-
tinues to refer to COVID–19 as the

‘‘China virus’’ and ‘‘kung flu’’ trying to 
shift attention and blame away from 
this administration’s inadequate re-
sponse and poor leadership. They would 
rather scapegoat Asian Americans, ex-
acerbating anti-Asian hate and vio-
lence. 
Congress needs to send a clear mes-
sage that we will stand with our AAPI 
community, especially during these 
challenging times, to fight bigotry and 
racism within our country. 
Hate speech does lead to violence and 
discrimination. That is the truth. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to condemn the xenophobic anti- 
Asian rhetoric that President Trump 
and his allies have been using to dis-
tract us from their woefully inadequate 
response to COVID–19. 
By referring to COVID–19 almost ex-
clusively as the ‘‘China virus,’’ the 
President is fueling racism and inspir-
ing violent attacks on Asian Ameri-
cans and Asian immigrants. Rather 
than condemning this divisive lan-
guage and unifying our Nation in re-
sponse to the pandemic, my Republican 
colleagues are blindly following suit. 
This partisanship is so pervasive that 
Congresswoman MENG’s simple resolu-
tion condemning this anti-Asian senti-
ment could not be passed unanimously 
out of this Chamber. This is a disgrace. 
A disgrace. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has become 
a defining moment in our Nation’s his-
tory. Instead of unifying to confront 
this disease head-on, Republicans have 
instead weaponized this to revive the 
racist blemishes of the past. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KELLY
of Illinois). Members are re-
minded to refrain from engaging in 
personalities toward the President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Was it a disgrace a few months ago 
when the Democratic chairman called 
it the ‘‘ Wuhan coronavirus,’’ or is it 
just a disgrace now when we are less 
than 7 weeks before an election and 
you guys want to continue to attack 
the President? Which is it? Because it 
can’t be a disgrace just now when you 
used the exact same language that the 
Democrat 
chairman, 
the 
Democrat 
staff used for their subcommittee hear-
ing. 
So you can get all fired up and start 
yelling at us, but the truth is you guys 
used it, the same terms you are now 
saying, oh, are so bad in this resolu-
tion. 
The hypocrisy from the left and the 
mob of what you can say today and 
can’t say tomorrow is ridiculous, and 
the American people see it. They see it. 
They know this is complete BS. They 
know it is completely about the elec-
tion, which is 7 weeks away. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, my dear friend 
from Ohio, for yielding. 
I am listening to my colleagues and 
the recent speaker. Where is that pas-
sion, where is that indignation over the 
violent mobs that are terrorizing our 
communities, that are assaulting our 
law enforcement officers? 
People are being killed in cold blood 
in once great American cities, and not 
nigh a word is said in this great Cham-
ber about what is happening to our fel-
low Americans whose rights are being 
trampled. 
Instead, 
they 
want 
to 
hyperventilate over this pettiness. 
We know what it is about, and the 
American people know what it is 
about, Madam Speaker. They know 
good and well this is about scoring po-
litical points. They have seen it over 
and over, day in and day out for the 
last 2 years under the Pelosi leadership 
of this great representative body; ob-
struction, more political theater, and 
just dividing us. 
This is dividing our country. This is 
opportunism like I have never seen be-
fore. You can’t refer to a virus by its 
place of origin? We have been doing 
that for time immemorial. And now we 
can’t call it the ‘‘Chinese virus,’’ some-
how that is offensive? 
This is about dividing our country. 
This is about stoking the flames of ra-
cial dissension. It is un-American. It is 
unacceptable for our leaders to do what 
is happening today. I trust the Amer-
ican people; they are watching this. 
This is the stark contrast in leader-
ship that we have been talking about. 
Do you want more of this, America? 
Do you want more resolutions to con-
demn calling the virus the ‘‘Wuhan 
virus?’’ Or do you want to condemn 
what is happening in Portland, in Se-
attle, and the rise in crime and the 
mass exodus by our police officers, who 
feel that they have jeopardized their 
livelihoods and their lives? We have 
disrespected them. We have demonized 
them. 
What are we doing in this Chamber? 
God save the Union. God have mercy 
that we can’t just come together, solve 
a few problems, I don’t know, like the 
unprecedented crisis that we are facing 
to get our fellow American citizens and 
families back on their feet. To hold 
China accountable for what they have 
done. 
There are real problems to solve, and 
I want to work with my colleagues. 
And they know we condemn racism. 
They know we don’t stand for making 
light of something so serious. But they 
are seizing on this political opportun-
istic moment. It is the wrong time. 
They are on the wrong side of history 
here, Madam Speaker. And the ulti-
mate judge of what happens today in 
this Chamber and what has happened 
over the last 2 years will be in the 
hands of we the people. And that is my 
faith, that is my confidence. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, and back 
to the subject of the resolution on the 
floor, which is discrimination against 
any and all Americans on the basis of 
their race. 
As the proud Representative of the 
State and district with the highest per-
centage of Asian Americans in this 
country, I rise today in strong support 
of H. Res. 908 to condemn any and all 
forms of anti-Asian discrimination dur-
ing and beyond this terrible pandemic. 
Our country confronts not only the 
novel coronavirus but also a virus of 
racism and hate. We cannot allow the 
one to feed off the other. 
On behalf of all Americans, we have a 
moral responsibility to call out and 
condemn this wave of racist hate 
speech, 
harassment, 
discrimination, 
and physical violence driven by fear, 
disinformation, and even purposeful ex-
ploitation. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this resolution 
without reservation and speak out 
against racism against any group in 
any form at any time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
after 9/11, President Bush never once 
called terrorism a Muslim virus or an 
Arab virus or a Saudi virus. He made 
clear that the enemy was not the place 
where the terrorists came from or the 
people who lived there, but terrorism 
itself. He did that because it was right 
and because he knew that equating the 
evil of al-Qaida with an entire faith or 
nationality or country was exactly 
what our enemies wanted. 
So today, when prominent people in 
our country, whether they are Repub-
licans or Democrats, or anybody in the 
media, encourage Americans to call 
COVID the ‘‘China virus,’’ language 
that seems to blame this pandemic on 
a country and a people, they are not 
only doing something wrong, some-
thing that has already encouraged vio-
lence and discrimination against Asian 
Americans, they are playing right into 
the hands of a Chinese Communist 
Party that wants Asian Americans to 
feel unwanted and unsafe in America. 
Now, if you want to blame this on the 
Chinese Government, sign me up. If 
you want to blame them or anybody 
else for lying to the American people, 
sign me up. But if you are going to give 
this virus a nationality, you are doing 
something wrong. And if you don’t see 
the 
difference 
between 
those 
two 
things, then you don’t understand what 
is going on in this country in this mo-
ment of division, this moment of dan-
ger that we face. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port this resolution condemning anti-

Asian rhetoric in any form. I ask my 
colleagues to vote for it, and I urge 
them to live up to it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CISNEROS). 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of this resolution 
condemning all forms of anti-Asian 
sentiment related to COVID–19. 
The AAPI community in the 39th 
District has been an integral part of 
fighting the coronavirus. They are first 
responders, 
essential 
workers, 
edu-
cators, and small business owners. 
Yet there have been too many stories 
in my district and across the country 
of racism, discrimination, and physical 
and 
verbal 
assault 
towards 
Asian 
Americans. 
I had the opportunity to hear some of 
these stories during one of my town 
halls, including the emotional encoun-
ter of a constituent from Brea, Cali-
fornia. This young woman was unable 
to pick up her mother’s prescription 
drugs due to racist aggressive remarks 
she received that were directed towards 
her. She left, running away in tears. 
This resolution will assure that cases 
like hers are justly investigated and re-
ceive the attention they deserve. 
I thank my colleague Representative 
MENG for her leadership, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote in support of this 
resolution to ensure protection, safety, 
and respect for our AAPI community. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, on this Constitution 
Day we will do well to heed the words 
of Dr. King when he reminded us that 
the ultimate measure of the person is 
not where the person stands in times of 
comfort and convenience, but where do 
you stand in times of challenge and 
controversy? 
Where do you stand when racism and 
anti-Semitism and anti-Asian senti-
ments are emanating from the highest 
office in the land? 
Where do you stand? 
b 1000 
I stand with the business owner who 
is losing business, and some have gone 
out of business because of this kind of 
hateful 
violence 
emanating 
from 
words. 
I stand with the mother who has to 
console her child who comes home 
from school and who has been bullied. 
I stand with the child who has been 
bullied who comes home crying. 
I stand with the people of my con-
gressional district and across this land 
who happen to be of Asian ancestry. 
I stand against racism. 
It is easy to say: ‘‘I am against rac-
ism. I condemn racism.’’ But when will 
you condemn the racist? When will you 
condemn the racist when it is ema-
nating from the highest office in the 
land? 
This is Constitution Day. 
I close with these words from Emily 
Dickinson. The truest measure of the 
person, I have reminded you, but Dick-
inson reminded us that: ‘‘A word is 
dead when it is said, some say. I say it 
just begins to live that day.’’ 
These words live; they take on mean-
ings; they impact people; and they 
cause harms. 
It is time for us to take a stand. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the import of this 
resolution could not be more clear. 
Anti-Asian sentiment will not be toler-
ated. Anti-Semitism will not be toler-
ated. Discrimination against anyone 
will not be tolerated. 
When language comes consistently 
from the White House, from other 
places that stoke anti-Asian senti-
ment, that stoke racism, this cannot 
be tolerated. And this House must de-
clare that we will not tolerate it. 
This House must be on record against 
the use of language designed to stoke 
racism, against the use of language de-
signed to pick out a particular ethnic 
group—in this case Asians, but it is the 
same as if it picked out a different eth-
nic group. 
No ethnic group should be the target 
of such obloquy, of such racism, of such 
opposition 
from 
the 
White 
House. 
None. 
It is unconscionable that we have to 
stand here and oppose the White House 
stoking anti-Asian sentiment. It is un-
conscionable that the White House 
would do such a thing. But if it does 
such a thing, then it is incumbent on 
this House to denounce it. 
It is incumbent on this House to 
make sure that the American people 
know that we do not stand with any-
one, whether in the White House or 
anyplace else, who stokes deliberately 
anti-Asian sentiment. 
We cannot abide, we must not abide, 
the use of public office, the use of pub-
lic facilities, the use of the public 
microphone to stoke anti-Asian senti-
ment, no more than we would tolerate 
it if it were stoking anti-Black senti-
ment or anti-Semitic sentiment. 
None of this is tolerable. We must 
not permit this. 
So, I say again, it cannot be allowed 
that, on the floor of this House, we do 
not denounce the use of public re-
sources, the use of the White House, 
the use of public resources to stoke 
anti-Asian sentiment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Will the gentleman 
yield for a question? 
Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio for a question. 
Mr. JORDAN. Was The Washington 
Post on January 26, 2020, to use your 
words, stoking anti-Asian bias when 
they 
used 
the 
word 
‘‘Chinese 
coronavirus’’? 
Was 
The 
New 
York 
Times on February 20, 2020, stoking 
anti-Asian bias when they used the 
term ‘‘Wuhan coronavirus’’ in their 
headline? 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. 
They learned their lesson. 
They 
stopped using such terms. They learned 
their lesson. 
They understood what this House 
should understand. They understood 
that the use of such terms stokes rac-
ism, stokes anti-Asian sentiment, and 
they stopped using the term because 
they learned the lesson. 
All we are saying is the White House 
should learn the same lesson, and they 
should stop using the term. And for 
that matter, Members of this House 
should stop using the term because it 
deliberately stokes anti-Asian senti-
ment. 
The Washington Post learned that 
lesson and ceased using such terms. 
The Washington Post learned the les-
son. 
We are not saying that everyone 
knew this initially, but it is clear. It is 
now clear. 
The Washington Post learned its les-
son and stopped using such terms. The 
New York Times learned its lesson 
when they realized that it was stoking 
anti-Asian 
sentiment 
and 
stopped 
using this term. 
We are saying that the White House 
and Members of this House and anyone 
else should learn the same lesson and 
not stoke anti-Asian sentiment by con-
tinuing the use of terms that we know 
stoke anti-Asian sentiment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
BERA). 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 908, led by 
my colleague Representative GRACE 
MENG. 
I do feel compelled, though, to re-
spond to my colleague on the other 
side of the aisle, Mr. JORDAN. I was 
that subcommittee chairman. We held 
the first coronavirus hearing in this 
new pandemic addressing the issues. 
Yes, we did identify it by its geo-
graphic 
origin 
as 
the 
Wuhan 
coronavirus. We also learned that as 
soon as we started to see instances of 
racism, violence against Asian Ameri-
cans, that was a mistake. We stopped 
using that term. That is what we do as 
adults. 
We are not here to instigate racism. 
We are not here to instigate violence 
against any ethnic group. 
What we are here to do is actually 
defeat this pandemic. 
In that hearing, what we talked 
about is it is fine doing a travel ban 
from a country. That would buy us 
some time. But we also rightfully iden-
tified that that travel ban wasn’t going 
to prevent the virus from coming to 
the United States. It wasn’t going to 
protect us. We had to get ready. 
We squandered that time.

H4501 
September 17, 2020 
Look, this is a virus. It doesn’t un-
derstand a country of origin. It doesn’t 
know whether you are a Democrat or 
Republican, what religion or God you 
worship. It is a virus. 
It is shameful for Members of this 
body or anyone to continue to use lan-
guage that potentially incites violence 
against any of our fellow citizens. That 
is what this resolution is about. Let’s 
actually learn from that. 
I don’t call it by its geographic ori-
gin. It now has a name. At that time, 
it didn’t have a name. It is called 
SARS-CoV2 or COVID–19. 
We ought to call it by its name. We 
should not willfully or intentionally 
use language that potentially incites 
violence against any of our fellow citi-
zens, that incites racism. We should be 
better than that. 
Let’s show the American public that 
we can actually learn, and let’s lead by 
example. That is what we should be 
doing in the House of Representatives. 
Again, we called it by its area of ori-
gin because the virus didn’t have a 
name. We have learned from that. We 
don’t do that. And we shouldn’t inten-
tionally use terminology that would 
incite violence against any ethnic 
group, religious group, or any of our 
fellow citizens. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I might con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, what we should also 
do is denounce violence, all the vio-
lence, we see in our urban areas. 
The Democrats were given that op-
portunity just 2 months ago when the 
Attorney General of the United States 
asked them: Why won’t you speak out 
against the violence in our cities? Why 
won’t you speak out against what the 
mob is doing in our cities? 
Guess what we got from them? We 
got silence. 
Let’s speak out against the violence 
we have seen for over 100 days in Port-
land and so many of our other great 
cities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the minority leader, the 
leader of our great Conference. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The gentleman makes a very good 
point. Are we here condemning two 
sheriffs from California getting shot 
while sitting in their car? No. 
Are we here talking about the inno-
cent lives that are being killed night 
after night in Chicago or other cities? 
No. 
Are we here, in the last hours before 
this body rushes to the airport to 
leave, to debate the help that we need 
for COVID, for those who are unem-
ployed, or the small businesses that are 
going to continue to lay off somebody 
or are wondering whether they can sur-
vive the next day, or for the schools 
wondering if they will have the re-
sources they need, or the States? No, 
we are not doing that. 
We are not doing any of that. But I 
will make this one promise to you: If 
the majority was on the other side, we 
would have already done that. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats are ne-
glecting the real issues. 
Month after month, they have re-
fused to end our dependence on China 
or even acknowledge that the Chinese 
Communist Party is a national secu-
rity threat. 
I have read it in the paper. We have 
heard it out in the public domain that 
the Communist Chinese Party wants to 
influence the election even. They have 
picked a side. 
Now, in January, Democrats were too 
busy impeaching the President to pay 
attention to what was happening in 
Wuhan. 
There is a common denominator 
here. Let’s just go through the cal-
endar. 
In January, they were too busy with 
impeaching. 
In February, they backed out of what 
should have been a bipartisan China 
Task Force. They actually said yes. 
The Washington Post actually had the 
article written. The members were al-
ready chosen. But the hour came, and 
the 
Democrats 
thought 
that 
was 
wrong. 
Then, let’s move to May. Speaker 
PELOSI said focusing on China is a di-
version. I look forward to hearing what 
the Speaker says about this resolution. 
Is that a diversion from solving the 
COVID relief that we need? 
In June, Chairman SMITH of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services on this very 
floor, just over at that mic, said this 
about China: It is not actually their 
job to tell the American people about 
the coronavirus. 
Seriously? Those were the words that 
were spoken by the chair of the Armed 
Services Committee. 
In July, Chairman SCHIFF—remember 
who he is and what role he has. He is 
the chairman of the Committee on In-
telligence. He said it was an escalation 
for the Trump administration to close 
down the Chinese consulate that was, 
according to the Secretary of State, 
the hub of spying and IP theft in Hous-
ton. He was the only one who thought 
that. 
And now, today, while Democrats 
deny the real threat of Communist 
China, they are delaying a coronavirus 
relief package because they despise the 
President. 
I heard a Member here, Madam 
Speaker, who said we are adults, so we 
think differently. You know what 
adults do? They give adult supervision, 
and they focus on things that are im-
portant. 
We only have a few hours left before 
people leave. I know Madam Speaker 
told us before August that we will not 
leave unless we get a COVID relief 
package. 
I am not sure if I should believe her 
then or believe her now, because I 
know people are going to leave in a few 
short hours. 
I know, as the majority, you have the 
power to schedule what comes to the 
floor. That was one of my jobs. So this 
is what they picked? This is what we 
are doing? Seriously? 
My question to the Democrats is sim-
ple: Is debating a nonbinding resolu-
tion the best use of our hour? Appar-
ently, you have made that decision. 
You thought long and hard long before 
we came to this moment in time. You 
spent hours on this. 
I will promise you this: There is no 
kitchen in America that thinks this is 
the priority. 
What makes today’s resolution so 
harmful is it does not stop discrimina-
tion. It simply spreads disinformation. 
At the heart of this resolution is an 
absurd notion that referring to the 
virus as the Wuhan virus or the China 
virus is the same as contributing to vi-
olence against Asian Americans, which 
I will tell you nobody on this side of 
the aisle supports. 
In fact, we have heard time and 
again—I just heard from my colleague 
on the other side. The Democrat-led 
Foreign Affairs Committee held a hear-
ing titled ‘‘The Wuhan Coronavirus’’ in 
February. 
b 1015 
Should we put an ethics complaint? 
Are Democrats saying that their own 
committee members are encouraging 
discrimination against Asian Ameri-
cans? 
Likewise, 
CNN, 
The 
Washington 
Post, NPR, The Guardian, all other 
major media outlets were referring to 
COVID–19 as the Wuhan coronavirus 
long before most Americans knew what 
it was. 
Now, let’s put this in contrast, be-
cause you are wasting our time; you 
are spending hours on it. You think it 
is the most important thing, when 
someone is sitting there in the unem-
ployment line or a small business is 
questioning whether they can stay 
open. So let’s take this moment in 
time on this floor talking about it. 
Republicans condemn crime and dis-
crimination in all forms. Listen to 
what the President said in March: 
‘‘spreading of the virus is not their 
fault in any way, shape, or form.’’ But 
I guess you can’t take his word for it, 
so let’s waste another hour on this 
floor on a nonbinding resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I wonder—because 
every Member who comes here works 
hard to get here, I wonder the number 
of times Members in a debate said they 
would take their time to have non-
binding resolutions on the floor. I won-
der the number of promises they made. 
Because I listened, Madam Speaker, to 
the Speaker up there when I handed 
her the gavel on what they said they 
would focus on. 
I have spent a lot of time trying to 
wonder what one problem this Demo-
crat majority has solved. I have actu-
ally asked Democrats: Name me one 
that you solved. 
I haven’t read a tweet from probably 
the most prominent of the new party’s 
chief of staff. They had the same ques-
tion. They couldn’t answer it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4502 
September 17, 2020 
The President’s words express what 
every good and decent American has 
known 
from 
the 
beginning: 
Asian 
Americans are not responsible for 
COVID–19. 
Let me be very clear. Let me state 
that again. The President’s words ex-
press what every good and decent 
American has known from the begin-
ning: Asian Americans are not respon-
sible for COVID–19. 
Now, let me tell you everything else 
every American understands. We have 
an economic problem. We have people 
unemployed. We have small businesses 
questioning whether they can stay 
open. We have schools that are won-
dering could they have the money to be 
able to open again. 
But you chose an hour of this time on 
the last day before we leave to debate 
a nonbinding resolution. Congratula-
tions. Well done. You fought hard for a 
majority, and this is what you decided. 
Unfortunately, 
while 
Democrats 
waste an hour of the House’s time on 
this ridiculous resolution, the oppor-
tunity costs of the inaction are rising. 
And do you know who is paying the 
price? The American people. 
For months, every reasonable Amer-
ican has understood that America must 
end our dependency on China; we must 
move our supply chain out of China for 
critical needs like medicine. 
Do you realize we don’t make peni-
cillin? We don’t make vitamins here, 
personal protective equipment that we 
strive so hard to get, and technology. 
The American people want safety and 
security. They want to return to the 
American way of life. 
I am not sure what this nonbinding 
resolution does, but I know we have 
done a lot of them since you have 
taken the majority. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Chinese 
Com-
munist Party is trying to hack our 
vaccine research at this very moment. 
That is why I introduced legislation 
earlier this summer to sanction these 
cybercriminals. My bill had real con-
sequences. 
And you know what is so unique? I 
introduced the bill because there were 
reports out there that Russia, China, 
Iran wanted to hack our universities, 
our businesses to get that vaccine, not 
to work with us, but to steal it. 
Do you know what happens when 
they do that? It slows the process 
down. 
Do you know what happens when it 
slows the process down? It takes longer 
before people have a safe vaccine that 
would cure this virus. 
It is very interesting. That moment 
on the floor, the day after I introduced 
it, we actually—the FBI found two Chi-
nese who were doing this, coming into 
our country, slowing the process down. 
We had the opportunity to have a 
motion to recommit on this floor. No-
body in America thought that bill 
would be partisan. It would only sanc-
tion those people who were caught, 
about right and wrong, about the safe-
ty, the security, a safe and effective 
vaccine being slowed down because of a 
foreign country coming in. So, as one, 
we had an opportunity to do something 
about it. 
Do you know what happened? The 
Democrats voted against it and de-
feated it. Not only did they defeat it, 
let me tell you, again, what the chair-
man of the Armed Services Committee 
said about it. He stood up at that 
microphone. He literally said it is not 
actually their job to tell the American 
people about the virus, referring to 
China, while they are hacking our own 
companies working to provide a safe 
and effective vaccine. 
You wouldn’t spend 1 minute on that, 
but you are spending an hour on this. 
Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. 
Madam Speaker, the majority won’t 
even work with the Republicans to pro-
tect our vaccine research from hackers, 
and they will attack the very compa-
nies that are working around the clock 
to provide that safe and effective vac-
cine for the American people. 
They won’t work with Republicans to 
restore American manufacturing to re-
build the American medical supply 
right here, but they will call the House 
back into session to debate conspiracy 
theories about the post office. 
And while we were here in that emer-
gency meeting—and, Madam Speaker, I 
should probably talk about it, because 
there were a lot of Democrats who 
didn’t come even though it was an 
emergency 
meeting 
called 
by 
the 
Speaker. I think it was one-third of all 
of them did not come. 
But while we were here, that one mo-
ment, the one opportunity that the Re-
publicans had, we offered a motion, a 
motion to recommit, to put up funding 
for COVID relief. Once again, the 
Democrats did the exact same thing. 
Instead of stopping the hackers from 
China, what they said no to, instead of 
giving another COVID relief bill that 
opportunity—because we were in an 
emergency, it was the only time we 
were 
coming 
back, 
even 
though, 
Madam Speaker, the Speaker said we 
would not leave—they voted it down. 
They voted it down, the only window 
that we had. 
They won’t even work with Repub-
licans on what was supposed to be a bi-
partisan China task force, but they 
wasted an hour on a nonbinding resolu-
tion. 
Is this how you expect to manage the 
Chamber? Is this why you took the ma-
jority, to waste the American people’s 
time? 
Madam Speaker, it is time for us to 
stop acting like the House of resolu-
tions and start acting like the House of 
Representatives. 
Make no mistake: China aims to dis-
place America as the world’s economic 
superpower. If they succeed, we will 
have more than viruses to worry about. 
The stakes are too high for petty par-
tisanship. If we want safety, if we want 
independence, we know what we have 
to do. We have to rebuild our economy, 
bring back our supply chain, protect 
our vaccine research and, yes, end our 
dependency on China. 
Our President is doing that. House 
Republicans have made a commitment 
to America to do just that. We have 
done it time and again, bringing the 
idea to the floor. Unfortunately, the 
majority has thought otherwise. 
Madam Speaker, I make this promise 
to you: If the sides change, if we have 
the opportunity and the privilege to 
determine what comes to this floor, we 
will not waste America’s time in a 
time of crisis. We will not tell people 
they will not leave and then let them 
go. We will not have Members call it an 
emergency meeting and let them stay 
home. 
We believe Congress is essential. We 
believe the American public expects 
that. 
Madam Speaker, we have a COVID 
crisis. We have an economy crisis. We 
have a dependency on China that 
harms us when it comes to our health 
issues. We have hackers from foreign 
nations trying to slow a safe and effec-
tive vaccine. We have schoolkids that 
continue to learn from home, not in 
school. We have veterans who want to 
be able to pick their own doctors. We 
have an infrastructure that is crum-
bling, but a 5-year plan to make a dif-
ference. These are all the problems 
that, if the majority would switch, 
would be addressed. 
But no, today, on our last day this 
week, we will once again have a non-
binding resolution. 
I hope you fought hard for this ma-
jority. I hope you spent a lot of time 
and a lot of hours deciding what would 
come to the floor. But if this is what it 
is, you have fallen well short of what 
America expects of this Chamber. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for the recogni-
tion, but I also thank Mr. NADLER, as 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
for bringing this important statement 
of our American values to the floor of 
the House. I thank him and our col-
leagues from the Senate, Senators 
KAMALA
HARRIS, TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, 
and MAZIE HIRONO, three Asian-Amer-
ican Members of the United States 
Senate who were so instrumental in ad-
vancing this important, as I said, 
statement of American values. 
And yes, it is a good use of time for 
us in the House of Representatives to 
state our values, to remove all doubt 
that people in our country are re-
spected, and that we are not using a 
pandemic to have people—I will go into 
that in a moment. 
But let me just say this. Before the 
distinguished leader spoke, the gen-
tleman on the other side said: Where 
are you when you are talking about vi-
olence, this or that?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4503 
September 17, 2020 
We are there. We support peaceful 
demonstrations. 
We 
participate 
in 
them. They are part of the essence of 
our democracy. That does not include 
looting, starting fires, or rioting. They 
should be prosecuted. That is lawless-
ness. I am very proud that Joe Biden 
has presented the clarity of that, mak-
ing a distinction that I don’t think our 
colleagues quite understand but the 
American people do. 
In a poll released today, it said that 
the American people support congres-
sional 
Democrats 
over 
President 
Trump in terms of dealing with the 
issue of crime in our country, for all of 
their misrepresentation. 
It is interesting to hear the revi-
sionist history that the distinguished 
leader put on the floor of this House 
when he asked us what have we done. It 
is a very long list, and I will go into 
some of it. 
But I want to say to him, when you 
had the majority and the Presidency, 
the one thing that you did was pass a 
tax bill that put $2 trillion of debt onto 
our children and giving 83 percent of 
the benefits to the top 1 percent in our 
country. And yet you resent the fact 
that we want to invest more money in 
making it safe for our children to go 
back to school; more money into crush-
ing the virus, which is what we do in 
the HEROES Act; and that we want to 
help our heroes. That is why it is called 
that. 
Our State and local employees, our 
State and local governments that pro-
vide services to the American people, 
our healthcare workers, our first re-
sponders, our police and fire, our trans-
portation, our sanitation workers, our 
food providers, all of those people 
working make life go on for us; with-
out them, we couldn’t. And our teach-
ers, our teachers, our teachers, the 
custodians of our children for a good 
part of their day and of their lives. 
b 1030 
Yet the disdain that the Republicans 
have for our heroes is clear because 
that is the obstacle to our bringing the 
coronavirus legislation to the floor 
that is so needed. I hope that we can 
reach agreement on that. 
So when they talk about accomplish-
ment, you had a President and you had 
two Houses of government. What did 
you do but take care of the top 1 per-
cent to the tune of 83 percent of the 
bill that would put $2 trillion of debt to 
our children and their future? 
In terms of China, I have taken sec-
ond place to no one in this body in my 
opposition to China for three decades. 
Sometimes I take pride in being called 
the most disliked American in China 
for my opposition to China; their trade 
policies which have been a rip-off of 
the American worker, and have fought 
them for decades, whether it is stealing 
our intellectual property, barriers to 
our products going into China and 
other violations; trying to stop their 
proliferation of weapons technologies 
of mass destruction to rogue countries, 
and delivery systems to make delivery 
possible of those weapons; to their 
human rights policies in Tibet and 
Hong Kong and now with the Uighurs 
and, again, all over China. So I have 
been on it every single day for over 30 
years. 
I need no pontificating from the lead-
er on the other side who seems to have 
newly arrived at this issue in order to 
deflect attention from the fact that the 
Russians are trying to, once again, in-
filtrate and jeopardize the security of 
our elections. Whoever interferes with 
our elections must be dealt with, what-
ever country it is; but all of a sudden it 
is all about China and not about Rus-
sia. I think the American people should 
decide who the next President of the 
United States is, not Vladimir Putin. 
So we come here today, and I say this 
about the legislation: We have had four 
bills that have been overwhelmingly 
bipartisan on COVID. Our first one on 
March 4 was testing, testing, testing; 
and still we do not have a commitment 
from this administration that we can 
crush the virus by testing, tracing, 
treatment, mask wearing, sanitation, 
ventilation, and separation—still. The 
solution is as plain as the nose on your 
face, which should be covered with a 
mask. 
Yet the President said he didn’t want 
to cause panic, but he doesn’t mind 
causing panic that will result in some 
terrible things happening to the Asian- 
American community in our country. 
He has brought about great angst as 
he shines a bright light on the injus-
tices experienced by so many, includ-
ing the surge of violence and discrimi-
nation being experienced by the Asian 
American/Pacific Islander community. 
So I thank the Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Caucus Chair, JUDY CHU; the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus Chair, JOA-
QUIN
CASTRO; and the Congressional 
Black Caucus Chair, KAREN BASS, for 
their leadership on this important res-
olution and this very necessary use of 
our time to condemn and combat anti- 
Asian sentiment. GRACE MENG has led 
this drumbeat for justice for a genera-
tion. Together with the other leaders 
she has brought this legislation to the 
floor, and I salute her. 
As the resolution states—and we 
have all seen—at the same time that 
the coronavirus pandemic has broken 
out, so too has a disturbing epidemic of 
hate and discrimination against the 
AAPI community erupted. You may 
not have noticed it. You may have 
tried to ignore it, but it, in fact, exists. 
According to the Stop AAPI Hate Re-
porting Center, more than 2,500 re-
corded incidents of anti-Asian hate 
have been perpetrated against the 
AAPI community since March. These 
include both physical and verbal at-
tacks, commuters spat on, racial slurs 
lobbed at passersby, community mem-
bers shunned, store owners having 
businesses vandalized, and even little 
children being pushed and shoved, and 
families insulted in places of business. 
Many of these incidents represent civil 
rights violations, and that is a value 
for us to protect. 
It is particularly unconscionable that 
more than 2 million members of the 
AAPI community are fighting on the 
front lines against the COVID–19 virus, 
yet instead of being celebrated as he-
roes, they are fighting violence and 
bigotry. 
In February, during one of my visits 
to San Francisco’s Chinatown—which I 
am 
overwhelmingly 
proud 
to 
rep-
resent—I was heartbroken to witness 
the devastating impact that fear, stig-
ma, and misinformation are continuing 
to have on its families and businesses. 
Nearly half of recorded incidents of 
anti-Asian hate, according to the Stop 
AAPI Hate Reporting Center, have oc-
curred in California. 
For many of the bay area who re-
member the systemic injustices and 
discrimination 
perpetrated 
against 
generations of Asian Americans, this 
resurgence is a traumatic reminder of 
the lingering specter of xenophobia. 
Sadly, this bigotry is being fueled by 
some in Washington, D.C.—I thought 
there would be almost unanimous con-
sent to condemn violence against Asian 
Americans—even from the White House 
itself, which uses dangerous, false, and 
offensive 
terms 
to 
describe 
the 
coronavirus. 
The World Health Organization and 
the CDC, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, have explicitly warned against 
linking infectious diseases to a specific 
ethnicity because of the stigmatizing 
effects which have serious impact on 
health and defeating the virus. As the 
CDC chief medical officer said, stigma 
is the enemy of public health. 
Anti-AAPI bigotry violates our bed-
rock American values and undermines 
our fight against the coronavirus, and 
it must end. 
That is why we must do our part to 
combat hate, and that is why I am 
proud to support this resolution and 
am proud to bring it to the floor as an 
appropriate and excellent statement of 
values and good use of our time, in-
stead of giving tax breaks to the 
wealthiest people in our country at the 
expense of our children and their fu-
ture. 
It calls on public officials to con-
demn and denounce any and all anti- 
Asian sentiment in any form, and it 
recognizes that the health and safety 
of all Americans, no matter their back-
ground, must be of the utmost priority. 
We are none of us safe until all of us 
are safe. 
It condemns all manifestations of ex-
pressions of racism, xenophobia, dis-
crimination, 
anti-Asian 
sentiment, 
scapegoating, and ethnic or religious 
intolerance. 
It calls on Federal law enforcement 
officials working with State and local 
officials to investigate and collect data 
on hate crimes and bring perpetrators 
to justice. 
It recommits our leaders to diversity 
and inclusion, including in our re-
sponse to COVID–19.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4504 
September 17, 2020 
This resolution has the support of 
hundreds of organizations, including 
from the medical and scientific com-
munities. 
Now I know science doesn’t mean 
much to you because you are anti- 
science, but the scientific community, 
the American College of Physicians, re-
cently wrote a letter of support for this 
resolution, stating: 
It is an essential step to support the health 
and safety of our Nation during a national 
crisis. 
Hate crimes directed against individuals 
based on individuals’ race, ethnic origin, an-
cestry, primary language, cultural back-
ground or nationality are a true public 
health threat. 
He goes on to say: 
It is imperative that physicians, and all 
people, speak out against hate and discrimi-
nation, especially during this national crisis 
caused by COVID–19. 
At this challenging time, our Na-
tion’s focus should be on respecting the 
dignity of everyone. That should al-
ways be the case. We cannot allow prej-
udice and discrimination to divide us. 
So let me just close by adding this: 
we had a tremendous opportunity, as I 
said, we passed four bills that were 
overwhelmingly 
bipartisan. 
The 
CARES Act has done some good things 
for our country. It also gave an enor-
mous, practically $150 billion, tax 
break to the wealthiest in our country 
and made it retroactive. 
What did that have to do with the 
coronavirus, making a tax break for 
the wealthy retroactive? 
They can’t pass a bill without doing 
something at the high end and then 
worrying when we want to help work-
ing class families in our country. 
Anyway, our counter to that bill was 
called the Take Responsibility Act. 
Those two bills came together. We were 
able to find our common ground, even 
though we had to swallow some bitter 
pills in order to help America’s work-
ing families as well as small businesses 
in our country. 
Why does it have to be so hard? 
Because there is an anti-science atti-
tude in this Congress and in this ad-
ministration. There is an anti-govern-
ance; there is contempt of science; and 
there is disdain for State and local gov-
ernment which does so much for our 
country. 
Don’t take it from me. The chairman 
of the Fed is saying that it recognizes 
that State and local government are an 
important part of our economy. 
Don’t take it from me that we cannot 
open our economy unless we crush this 
virus. That is exactly what the Fed 
chairman said yesterday: it is essential 
to do this. 
But it takes money, it takes respect 
for science, and respect for the advice 
of scientific leaders in our country that 
has been absent. Instead, they play a 
blame game. 
Who pays the price? 
The Asian-American community in 
our country. 
That is why it is essential for us to 
follow GRACE MENG’s lead and that of 
the Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, and Black 
Caucus leadership today. 
I thank, again, the chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee for his leadership 
in bringing this important legislation 
to the floor. It is one of many. 
We have many bills that we have 
taken up and we will take up next 
week as we try to work together to 
find our common ground. One thing 
that we are working on right now is to 
keep government open, because while 
they may have an anti-governance at-
titude, we know that we have to make 
our compromises to keep government 
open. 
So, Madam Speaker, I thank you for 
the opportunity to use my Speaker’s 1 
minute to salute the leadership and 
thank the sponsors of this legislation. 
You bring luster to the House of Rep-
resentatives when you enable us to as-
sociate ourselves with the great values 
of our country and to respect the dig-
nity and worth of everyone in our 
country. It has never been more impor-
tant than in this time of great crisis in 
our country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. I want 
to remind all Members to address their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Speaker of the 
House said that the Russians are trying 
to jeopardize the security of our elec-
tion. So are the Democrats. 
Democrats are trying to win the elec-
tion after the election. Democrats in 
Pennsylvania have filed a lawsuit that 
says you can fix errors on absentee bal-
lots after the ballot has been returned 
to the Board of Elections. I don’t even 
know what this means. 
Can you vote in a race you didn’t 
vote in? 
Can you change a vote? 
What does that mean, you can fix er-
rors after you have already submitted 
the ballot? 
In Nevada, Democrats passed a law 
that says you can accept mail-in bal-
lots 3 days after the election, even if 
the postmark date on the ballot on the 
envelope can’t be distinguished. 
They are trying to win the election 
after the election. That is scary. 
The Speaker said that the White 
House is using dangerous and offensive 
language. The premise of the resolu-
tion in front of us is language can 
cause people to take action, and if you 
use the term ‘‘China virus’’ or ‘‘Wuhan 
virus’’, somehow that will lead to bias 
against Asian-American people; even 
though they used the terms ‘‘China 
virus’’ and ‘‘Wuhan virus’’. Everyone in 
the mainstream media used it. They 
used it in the committee hearing no-
tice. 
Even though all that is there, they 
now say, oh, if you use those terms it 
will lead to anti-Asian bias. 
But they don’t talk about the lan-
guage they use and the left uses, the 
language the Speaker uses and how 
that may create an environment that 
will lead to violence. The Speaker of 
the House called the President of the 
United States an enemy of the state 
and said his supporters in Congress— 
Republicans—are enemies of the state. 
They don’t talk about that. No. 
China virus can lead people to take ac-
tion, but, no, not when the Speaker of 
the House calls the President of the 
United States and Republican Members 
of Congress enemies of the state. 
Two years ago a Democrat Member of 
Congress, the chair of a committee said 
this 2 years ago this summer: If you see 
somebody in the Trump Cabinet, you 
create a crowd, you push back on them, 
you tell them they are not welcome 
anymore anywhere. 
She encouraged her constituents to 
approach people in the Trump adminis-
tration, harass them, and tell them 
they are not welcome anymore any-
where. 
She encouraged direct action. That is 
far different from using the term 
‘‘China virus’’ which they used and 
which they had in a committee notice. 
b 1045 
This individual Member of Congress 
said, ‘‘Go harass people in the Trump 
Cabinet.’’ 
The Speaker of the House calls Re-
publicans ‘‘enemies of the State.’’ And 
that is all fine by them. 
But, oh, you say, ‘‘the virus started 
in Wuhan, China,’’ and somehow you 
are terrible. 
This is the crazy world the left is in 
today. The crazy world they are in 
today. 
And, again, as said earlier by the 
gentleman from Texas and by others, I 
think the American people see right 
through this baloney, see right through 
it. This is ridiculous. 
I hope we get our senses and start— 
as the Republican minority leader 
said—I hope we would actually start 
spending more of our time on issues of 
more value to the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank our distinguished chairman of 
the Committee on the Judiciary, and I 
thank and applaud the gentlewoman 
from New York for her outstanding 
leadership and championing the rights 
of all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, from the unwar-
ranted, 
unwanted 
allegations 
of 
hysterectomies in immigrant women 
around the Nation in detention cen-
ters, to the President of the United 
States taking to the bully pit to be 
able 
to 
call 
COVID–19 
and 
the 
coronavirus the ‘‘China virus,’’ we are 
finding ourselves in the midst of confu-
sion that is hurting the American peo-
ple—hurting them in two ways: 
One, over 6 million COVID–19 infec-
tions in the United States, and now, 
predictions of upwards of 250,000 dead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4505 
September 17, 2020 
Every one of them we, as Members of 
the United States Congress, should 
mourn because families, sadly, are hav-
ing to bury family members having not 
seen them in their last days. 
What good is it to use that word—the 
‘‘Wuhan’’ virus? That is not the sci-
entific term. And out of that, we have 
created a hostile situation for our 
Asian-American 
friends, 
for 
Asian 
Americans who have been at the front 
lines fighting on behalf of this Nation. 
The use of anti-Asian terminology 
and rhetoric related to COVID–19, such 
as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, 
kung flu have perpetrated anti-Asian 
stigma and is reminiscent of dark and 
shameful chapters in America’s past 
where Asian Americans were labeled as 
the ‘‘yellow peril’’ and interned in relo-
cation camps. 
Madam Speaker, more than 23 mil-
lion Asian American and Pacific Is-
landers account for 7 percent of the Na-
tion’s population in the United States, 
but over 2 million Asian American and 
Pacific Islanders are working on the 
front lines of this COVID–19 pandemic 
in healthcare, law enforcement, first 
responders, 
transportation, 
super-
markets, and other service industries. 
They feel threatened. 
For example, in March 2020, an Asian 
woman wearing a mask was kicked and 
punched at a New York City subway 
station by individuals; two children 
and two adults were stabbed at a 
wholesale grocery store. This was anti- 
Asian rhetoric. Finally, let me say, my 
own constituent, Coco Ma, in Houston, 
was afraid to go into a grocery store. 
Madam Speaker, include an article 
describing her concern. 
[From houstonchronical.com, Apr. 17, 2020] 
IN
HOUSTON’S
NEW
NORMAL, A
DIFFERENT 
CURVE EMERGES: OUTWARD RACISM TOWARD 
ASIAN AMERICANS 
(By Olivia P. Tallet) 
Coco Ma knows it’s risky to leave her 
house amid the coronavirus pandemic, as the 
number of Houston area confirmed cases in-
creases and the peak is yet to come. 
The Rice University MBA student, how-
ever, doesn’t even do the occasional run to 
the supermarket because, for her, the risk 
comes not only with battling against the 
virus but also against the vitriol aimed at 
Asian Americans like her, stereotyped as 
culprits of the pandemic. 
‘‘I have that fear . . . I ask my husband, 
who is white, to pick up the food we order. 
I’m afraid to go inside myself,’’ said Ma, 
aware of the scapegoating impacting Chinese 
Americans and Asians in general who are 
mistaken as people from China, where the 
COVID–19 pandemic was first detected. 
Almost 1,500 hate incidents against Asian 
American and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. 
have been reported to the STOP AAPI HATE 
initiative since it began tracking incidents 
March 19. 
‘‘We know that (that) number is only a 
drop in the bucket. We know that this is 
really 
ubiquitous 
now,’’ 
said 
lawyer 
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the 
Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council 
and founder of the tracking hate initiative, 
headquartered in California. 
Although the tracking isn’t well known 
around the country, it has already received 
reports of incidents in 46 states, including 
Texas, said Kulkarni. The majority of the at-
tacks are verbal, but some are also physical. 
TO REPORT INCIDENTS 
Hate and racist incidents against Asian 
Americans related to the COVID–19 pan-
demic can be reported to: Hate is Con-
tagious: racismiscontagious.com; Stop AAPI 
Hate: 
asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/ 
stop-aapi-hate. 
In West Texas, a man stabbed and cut 
members of a family from Burma, at a super-
market in Midland on March 14. The father 
and one of his two small children were se-
verely wounded before a store employee sub-
dued the attacker. The man allegedly said he 
did it because he thought the family was 
from China and infecting people with the 
virus. Local media outlets reported that the 
FBI is investigating the case as a hate crime. 
In Houston, a city known for its diversity 
and tolerance, a woman verbally attacked 
the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant 
Vietopia earlier this month in a parking lot 
in front of the business, screaming expletives 
and, ‘‘You, get out of our country.’’ 
‘‘I felt unwanted here. We were very of-
fended,’’ said Sammi Tran, co-owner and wife 
of the victim, who videotaped the incident. 
‘‘My husband was born here in America. We 
don’t harm anybody, but this is happening 
now. I’ve never felt like this before.’’ 
‘‘We go to the supermarket and they look 
at us as if we were ugly people,’’ Tran said. 
‘Racism Is Contagious’ 
At over half a million people, Asians make 
up 8 percent of the population in the Houston 
metro area. Residents with Chinese heritage 
represent the third largest subgroup after In-
dian and Vietnamese. Roughly 70 percent of 
Asians in the city are U.S. born or natural-
ized citizens, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. 
Statewide, about 1.5 million residents iden-
tify as Asians, or 5.2 percent of the popu-
lation. 
In 
Houston’s 
Chinatown, 
the 
novel 
coronavirus hit businesses hard in January, 
well before residents were ordered to stay at 
home. Rumors spread on social media falsely 
claiming that an Asian supermarket in the 
area was shut down by the government due 
to coronavirus infections. 
Although there wasn’t a single COVID–19 
case in the state at the time, the rumors 
quickly propelled a fear of contagion and 
customers avoided the area, driving losses 
that reached 70 percent overnight for many 
Asian American businesses. 
Not long afterward, President Donald 
Trump called the agent of the pandemic ‘‘the 
Chinese virus,’’ stirring outrage and concern 
among Asian Americans. 
‘‘The community feels under siege. There 
is a genuine, palpable sense of fear in the 
Asian American community, they feel that 
they’re being targeted,’’ said Texas Rep-
resentative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Hous-
ton. ‘‘And this is not a Democratic or Repub-
lican issue. I’ve heard this from Democratic 
and Republican’’ Asians. 
Trump recently said he was not going to 
use ‘‘Chinese virus’’ anymore, but some of 
his supporters do. 
‘‘China poisoned our people. President 
Trump has the courage to call it as it is: The 
Chinese Virus,’’ the narrator’s voice says 
over a sinister music clip in a campaign ad 
currently running on local television sta-
tions for Kathaleen Wall, who is in the GOP 
runoff for the 22nd District of Texas, rep-
resenting the Sugar Land area. 
Asked if she didn’t consider that her ad 
could negatively impact Asian Americans, 
she answered in an email: ‘‘Leave it to Texas 
Democrats like Sri Preston Kulkarni to de-
fend the Chinese Communist Party while ten 
thousand Americans have died because of the 
Coronavirus.’’ Kulkarni is the Democratic 
candidate running in the November general 
election for District 22. 
Wea H. Lee, chairman of the Asian South-
ern News Group and the business organiza-
tion International Trade Center in Houston, 
said attempts to diminish Asian people and 
their cultures overlook their success and in-
tegration in the country, such as having 
higher levels of income and education than 
the U.S. population overall. 
‘‘These politicians, the people making this 
kind of statement, it’s so stupid, they are so 
nave that they don’t see really what our 
community looks like,’ said Lee. 
The Anti Defamation League warns that 
online forums and posts, some from white su-
premacist groups, are ridiculing Chinese peo-
ple in relation to COVID–19 and portraying 
them as a dirty culture. 
A national campaign called ‘‘Racism Is 
Contagious’’ is using data to raise awareness 
about the issue and collect reports of abuses. 
It shows photos of Asians wearing a mask 
with the message ‘‘I am not a Virus,’’ which 
has become a viral hashtag. 
INVISIBLE STORIES 
For many Chinese Americans, the real 
story buried under the vitriolic noise is that 
their network of connections with China, 
Asian doctors and business people is pre-
cisely what has helped them help others dur-
ing the coronavirus crisis. 
The North Houston Chinese American com-
munity, for example, acquired part of its do-
nation of masks and medical supplies to 
local healthcare providers via their connec-
tions in China, said Yanbo Wang, one of the 
organizers. They raised over $14,000 in dona-
tions from 98 families and have helped seven 
nonprofit health providers and organiza-
tions. 
‘‘We paid for shipments to bring masks 
that people in China donated to us,’’ said 
Wang. The shipment arrived right when 
those supplies were difficult to find. 
Similarly, The Pearland Chinese Associa-
tion collected and donated masks and other 
products from many Asian Americans who 
bought them earlier in the year. Hearing 
from their families in China about the epi-
demic gave them an edge to prepare and ac-
quire products before the pandemic was well 
known in America. 
Jie Wu, a board member of the association, 
said many Asian Americans who work in the 
Texas Medical Center also let them know 
early about concerns with medical supplies. 
She said they mobilized and raised thousands 
of dollars plus masks, gloves and protective 
gowns, in what the organization calls ‘‘The 
Love for the Community Initiative.’’ 
Masks were collected among school par-
ents, many of whom worry that the stigma 
can hurt Asian American children born in 
the U.S. Some reports nationwide have al-
ready pointed to hateful incidents against 
minors. 
Coco 
Ma, 
the 
co-founder 
of 
#SnacksForMedStaff initiative, is also con-
cerned about the stereotyping. 
‘‘But I also want people to understand that 
I wanted to start the campaign not to prove 
who I am (and that) people should not get 
mad at me’’ as an Asian person, said Ma. 
‘‘We Asians are doing this because we care.’’ 
The idea of sending food to medical teams 
working in hospitals with COVID–19 cases 
came to Ma while talking on the phone with 
her mother, who is an administrator at a 
hospital in China dealing with the pandemic. 
Initially, she sent snacks to a few healthcare 
providers, but the initiative grew with peo-
ple sending her money for a GoFundMe cam-
paign.

and program partner Kathleen Harcourt,

who is Asian American, have now created a 
website to make all the #SnacksForMedStaff 
activities transparent to donors. They have 
raised around $12,000 of a $20,000 goal and 
have sent food packages to hospital teams in 
Texas and other four states among the hard-
est hit by the pandemic. 
‘‘We are getting very good feedback from 
doctors,’’ Ma said. ‘‘They feel appreciated.’’ 
As the coronavirus is soon expected to 
peak locally, adding pressure to medical 
teams, Ma said her initiative will raise the 
funding goal and provide more packages. 
‘‘People are so polarized,’’ said Ma. ‘‘For-
get about politics, especially during this 
pandemic. Forget about race. Focus on what 
is the problem and coming up with a solu-
tion. This is about humanity first.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I support this legislation because we 
have to stand to cure, to fix COVID–19, 
not to stigmatize and destroy the op-
portunity of saving America and doing 
the right thing by science. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, 
and the Budget Committee, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 908, which condemns anti- 
Asian sentiment in all its forms and manifesta-
tions, from whatever quarter, and from whom-
ever, from the ordinary citizen up to and in-
cluding the President of the United States. 
Since January 2020, there has been a dra-
matic increase in reports of hate crimes and 
incidents against those of Asian descent and 
the danger accelerates as the number of 
deaths attributable to COVID–19, which cur-
rently stands at 197,000, continues to increase 
and is expected to exceed 250,000 by Elec-
tion Day on November 3, 2020. The use of 
anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to 
COVID–19, such as the ‘‘Chinese Virus’’, 
‘‘Wuhan Virus’’, and ‘‘Kung-flu’’ have perpet-
uated anti-Asian stigma and is reminiscent of 
dark and shameful chapters in America’s past 
where Asian-Americans were escaped as the 
‘‘yellow peril’’ and interned in relocation 
camps. 
Madam Speaker, more than 23,000,000 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders ac-
count for 7 percent of the Nation’s population 
in the United States and over 2,000,000 Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders are working 
on the frontlines of this COVID–19 pandemic 
in health care, law enforcement, first respond-
ers, transportation, supermarkets, and other 
service industries. Madam Speaker, there are 
approximately 2 million Asian American owned 
businesses that generate over $700 billion in 
annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million 
workers. 
According to a recent study, there were over 
400 cases related to COVID–19 anti-Asian 
discrimination just between February 9, 2020, 
and March 7, 2020 with Asian Americans 
being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated 
for the COVID–19 pandemic. For example, in 
March 2020, anti-Asian woman wearing a 
mask was kicked and punched at a New York 
City subway station; two children and two 
adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in 
Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and 
robbed by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; 
and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital 
after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles, 
California. 
According to a report in the Houston Chron-
icle, during this pandemic a different curve has 
emerged in the Harris County metroplex, one 
of outward racism toward Asian Americans, 
where the increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric 
has also resulted in Asian-American busi-
nesses being targeted for vandalism. 
Madam Speaker, the Secretary General of 
the United Nations called for international soli-
darity and an end to any ill-founded discrimi-
nation of the outbreak’s victims. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
counsels against that naming COVID–19 by its 
geographic location or linking it to a specific 
ethnicity because such linkage perpetuates 
stigma. For this reason, in 2015, the WHO 
issued guidance calling on media outlets, sci-
entists, and national authorities to avoid nam-
ing infectious diseases for locations. 
On February 27, 2020, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services stated ‘‘ethnicity 
is not what causes the novel coronavirus’’ and 
that it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call 
COVID–19 the ‘‘Chinese virus.’’ On February 
28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical 
Officer of the CDC said, ‘‘Stigma is the enemy 
of public health’’ and on March 10, 2020, Dr. 
Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testi-
fied 
that 
use 
of 
the 
term 
‘‘Chinese 
coronavirus’’ is wrong and inappropriate. 
So, I am proud to be an original cosponsor 
and to strongly support H. Res. 908 intro-
duced by my friend, the gentlelady from New 
York, Congresswoman MENG. The resolution 
calls on all public officials to condemn and de-
nounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in 
any form and recognizes that the health and 
safety of all Americans, no matter their back-
ground, must be of utmost priority. The resolu-
tion condemns all manifestations of expres-
sions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, 
anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic 
or religious intolerance and calls on Federal 
law enforcement officials, working with State 
and local officials to expeditiously investigate 
and document all credible reports of hate 
crimes and incidents and threats against the 
Asian-American community in the United 
States. 
The resolution also calls upon federal, state, 
and local authorities to so, collect data to doc-
ument the rise of incidences of hate crimes 
due to COVID–19; and to take action when-
ever appropriate to hold the perpetrators of 
those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable 
and bring such perpetrators to justice. Finally, 
and importantly, H. Res. 908 recommits 
United States leadership in building more in-
clusive, diverse, and tolerant communities and 
combatting misinformation and discrimination 
that put Asian Americans at risk. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H. Res. 908 and I thank Congresswoman 
MENG for introducing this important resolution. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H. Res. 908. I 
rise today in support of my constitu-
ents of Asian descent. 
Central Virginia is the proud home to 
a strong and vibrant Asian-American 
community. 
And 
since 
COVID–19 
began, we have seen a disturbing in-
crease in hate crimes directed at the 
Asian-American community across the 
country, including in Virginia. 
Our neighbors, our fellow Americans, 
should never be the victims of dis-
crimination, violence or derision. And 
today, I am proud to stand with them 
and support this resolution on the floor 
of the House. 
We should all actively and forcefully 
condemn these acts of hate directed at 
our friends and our neighbors, at home, 
across our communities. And today, I 
am proud to do so with my vote on the 
floor of the House. A vote that affirms 
the following: 
That we call on public officials to 
condemn and denounce anti-Asian sen-
timent; 
That we recognize that the health 
and safety of all Americans of any 
background should be our priority; 
That we condemn the manifestation 
and the expression of racism, xeno-
phobia, and anti-Asian sentiment; 
That we call on Federal law enforce-
ment officials working with State and 
local officials to expeditiously inves-
tigate hate crimes; and 
That we recommit the United States’ 
leadership to build a more inclusive, 
tolerant society. 
Madam Speaker, to my colleagues 
who agree with these principles, I urge 
them to vote ‘‘yes’’ in support of this 
resolution and in support of our neigh-
bors. I, for one, will proudly vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the resolution for all the reasons we 
have articulated here this morning. I 
think it is important to go back and 
just remember, this is not about people 
of Asian-American descent. This is not 
about the Chinese people. 
It is about the Chinese Communist 
Party. It is about the Chinese Govern-
ment, a government that lied to us 
about the origins of this virus, lied to 
the world, used the World Health Orga-
nization to continue to mislead the 
United States and the world. That has 
been where the criticism has been tar-
geted by the President. 
But, again, 7 weeks before an elec-
tion, Democrats don’t care about the 
facts. They care about attacking the 
President, calling his supporters, as 
the Speaker of this House did, ‘‘en-
emies of the state,’’ bringing a resolu-
tion to the floor of this nature, but not 
being willing to condemn the violence 
and the mobs in the streets of our cit-
ies and certain places for over 100 days 
straight, looting and violence and riot-
ing and attacks on our law enforce-
ment officers. Nope, can’t. We can’t 
bring a resolution. We can’t talk about 
that. When the Attorney General of the 
United States asked, the Democrat 
members of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary won’t even speak up then. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we defeat 
this resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is an important 
resolution that will put the House 
firmly on record against the insidious

September 17, 2020 
form of racism and racial scapegoating 
that we have seen since the COVID–19 
pandemic began. 
It is completely unacceptable to use 
derogatory and prejudicial terms, like 
‘‘Chinese virus’’ or ‘‘Wuhan virus,’’ as 
if they merely describe the factual re-
ality of where the novel coronavirus 
that causes COVID–19 originated. 
First, this logic does nothing to jus-
tify the use of the term ‘‘kung flu,’’ an-
other term often used by some to de-
scribe COVID–19, a term clearly de-
signed to mock Asians and to associate 
them unfairly with this disease. 
Madam Speaker, the need for this 
legislation is clear. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as millions 
across our nation continue to be impacted by 
the coronavirus, many continue to live in fear 
following the dramatic increase of threats and 
attacks against those of Asian descent since 
the COVID–19 outbreak. 
Since January 2020, there has been a sig-
nificant number of reports of anti-Asian inci-
dents; wherein, due to scapegoating Asian 
Americans for the spread of COVID–19, many 
are being threatened, harassed, or assaulted, 
or have had their businesses vandalized. The 
upsurge of racial discrimination against Asian 
Americans has been fueled by misinformation 
about the coronavirus and usage of anti-Asian 
rhetoric and terms like ‘‘Chinese virus’’ and 
‘‘Kung-flu.’’ All of our nation’s leaders must 
stop using these racist phrases that instigate 
hatred and violence. In the midst of the 
COVID–19 crisis, Asian Americans are left 
fighting an additional front—that of hate and 
bigotry. 
That is why I introduced a resolution con-
demning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as 
related to COVID–19. We, as leaders of this 
nation, must coalesce and condemn all mani-
festations of expressions of racism, xeno-
phobia, discrimination, and anti-Asian senti-
ment and scapegoating. We must denounce 
any and all anti-Asian sentiment of any form. 
Madam Speaker, during this time of height-
ened anxiety and fear surrounding COVID–19, 
we cannot lose sight of protecting the health 
and safety of every single person—no matter 
their race, ethnicity, religion, or background. 
The House must take a strong stand against 
the sickening intolerance, bigotry, and violence 
that is leaving a terrible stain on our nation’s 
history, especially during this moment of an 
unprecedented public health crisis. The adop-
tion of this resolution is a necessary step to 
confront the second pandemic of racism and 
discrimination in this country. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in this effort to keep all 
Americans safe. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of House Resolution 908— 
Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment 
as related to COVID–19. I praise my distin-
guished colleague, Congresswoman GRACE 
MENG, First Vice-Chair of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), for 
her exemplary leadership on this Resolution 
on behalf of Asian-Americans and Asian and 
Pacific Islander communities all over the 
world. 
With this Resolution, I am reminded of the 
talented and brave Asians and Asian-Ameri-
cans who have helped lead us through 
COVID–19. I think of my district’s University of 
Toledo Medical Center’s molecular specialist, 
Dr. Ji-Youn Yeo, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow 
of South Korean descent. Dr. Yeo’s expertise 
helped the Center’s coronavirus pathology lab 
modify its test to keep employees safe during 
the testing process. First Lady of Maryland, 
Yumi Hogan, was instrumental in obtaining 
500,000 testing kits for Maryland by working 
with the South Korean Ambassador to the 
United States, Lee Soo Hyuk. The people of 
South Korea were able to minimize the devas-
tation of COVID–19 on its own shores and be-
came an example to the world by imple-
menting lessons and procedures learned from 
its MERS outbreak. These efforts are a signifi-
cant representation of how Asian communities 
are helping to combat the corona virus. 
To incite anti-Asian sentiments through rac-
ism, discrimination, or religious intolerance, 
especially related to COVID–19, is an insult to 
the very people who have helped shape our 
country. At this difficult time as we experience 
a resurgence of this troubling discrimination, I 
am reminded of my trailblazing colleagues as 
they continue the fight against discrimination, 
and through their efforts, are making our na-
tion a fairer and more just society. One such 
trailblazer is the distinguished Chairwoman of 
CAPAC, Congresswoman JUDY CHU, the first 
Chinese American woman elected to the 
United States Congress. She has served with 
great dignity and has been a fierce leader and 
advocate for Asian Americans. Former Con-
gressman and CAPAC Chair Emeritus, Mike 
Honda, a statesman who was forced into a 
Japanese internment camp with his family in 
Colorado and then thrived to become a Mem-
ber of the United States House of Representa-
tives. He experienced xenophobia firsthand, 
and we heartfully thank him for teaching all 
those who face oppression that they have the 
ability to overcome and achieve remarkable 
things. I also recognize our distinguished 
Chairman of the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, Congressman MARK TAKANO. 
He is a consummate educator and brave lead-
er who became the first openly gay person of 
color to serve in Congress. These are some of 
America’s finest patriots. 
I had the honor and privilege to serve with 
Congress’ first female Member of color, Patsy 
Mink. A third generation Japanese American, 
she achieved greatness through insurmount-
able barriers. A fighter for the fundamental be-
lief in equality, Mink co-authored Title IX to en-
sure that no person, regardless of sex, could 
be excluded from any education program or 
activity receiving federal financial assistance. 
She was ahead of her time and laid a great 
foundation for Asian Americans and women to 
follow. Congresswoman MENG’s efforts today 
proudly honor her memory. 
To the current and past Asian American and 
Pacific Islander Members of Congress, the 
current 74 bicameral members of the Con-
gressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, 
and the many Asian Americans who are work-
ing every day to make sure America stands 
tall during COVID–19, I salute them and their 
service to a grateful nation. I urge support for 
H. Res. 908. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker. I rise today to support H. 
Res. 908, which condemns all forms of anti- 
Asian sentiment as related to COVID–19. 
Since the beginning of this pandemic, the 
Asian American community in Philadelphia 
and nationwide has seen an alarming surge in 
anti-Asian bigotry and in hate crimes. There is 
no doubt that COVID–19 has resulted in the 
spread of hate, racism, and xenophobia to-
ward the Asian American community. 
As you may already know, the FBI warned 
at the end of March that they expected to see 
hate crime incidents against Asian Americans 
to increase suddenly as the general public as-
sociated the coronavirus with the Asian Amer-
ican population. At its peak, there were nearly 
100 hate incidents being reported each day. 
Yet, the President and his Administration 
failed to address this and fueled this mis-
conception with their rhetoric. 
Madam Speaker, words matter. This wide-
spread racism against Asian Americans during 
this public health crisis is a serious and de-
structive issue that negatively impacts the 
lives of millions in our nation. Congress has a 
duty to address the ongoing anti-Asian senti-
ment and break the silence, raise awareness, 
and change the public perception surrounding 
it. 
In my hometown of Philadelphia, we have 
witnessed far too many hate crimes. Back in 
February, a young man and woman were 
physically assaulted by a group of juveniles at 
a SEPTA station in what appeared to be a ra-
cially motivated anti-Asian attack. In March, 
several Asian American homes were harassed 
through letters. Later in April, an Asian Amer-
ican-owned restaurant in my Congressional 
district was vandalized with spray-paint graffiti 
that included a racial slur. Just last month, an 
Asian American pregnant mother was attacked 
on the streets by someone who deliberately 
mentioned her race during the attack. 
The Asian American community has en-
riched the city of Philadelphia, and our nation, 
and we must do more to protect them. The 
prejudice against the Asian American commu-
nity distracts us from finding real solutions to 
the pandemic at a time when they are much 
needed. 
Madam Speaker, now, more than ever, it is 
important to stand in solidarity with the Asian 
American community. We cannot let the rise in 
hateful rhetoric and discrimination go un-
checked. We must work together to build a 
more inclusive and diverse society, and this 
resolution is a step toward achieving that. urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
resolution to build on America’s diversity, 
which has proven to be one of our greatest 
strengths. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of House Resolution 908, 
which condemns the anti-Asian rhetoric that 
has arisen because of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Madam Speaker, our Asian friends, 
neighbors and family members have been un-
fairly targeted by bigotry in the wake of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Using terms like the 
‘‘China Virus’’ and ‘‘Kung Flu’’ is offensive to 
the communities I represent in the Lower East 
Side and Brooklyn. Our friends and neighbors 
in these communities are essential workers 
and small business owners who provided crit-
ical services to our community as the pan-
demic raged across New York City, and con-
tinue to play an essential role in our city’s re-
covery from the virus. Unfortunately, New York 
City has seen a spike in bias crimes. We can-
not let hate crimes go unpunished, let alone 
condone them. 
As the resolution states, there are over 2 
million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders

working on the frontline combatting against the 
pandemic. We must stand in solidarity with our 
friends and neighbors by denouncing the vitriol 
and anti-Asian sentiment. Our response to this 
pandemic should have been a unifying mo-
ment for our country. Instead, the administra-
tion has actively sought to inflame racial ten-
sions. Today, we say ‘‘no more’’ to the anti- 
Asian rhetoric from the White House. I am 
proud to cosponsor this bill and I want to 
thank my colleague from New York Rep-
resentative GRACE MENG, for her leadership 
on this issue and urge all my colleagues to 
support its passage. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of this resolution that 
condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment 
during this COVID–19 pandemic. This public 
health crisis has caused significant pain and 
suffering to communities across our nation, 
and we are especially concerned about an ap-
parent increase in verbal and physical attacks, 
as well as discrimination, against Asian Ameri-
cans. 
Our society must clearly state that this xen-
ophobia must not and will not be accepted. 
Asian Americans are not responsible for the 
spread of COVID–19, and yet they have been 
repeatedly harassed, discriminated, and even 
attacked by some who wrongly believe they 
are at fault. There are over two thousand re-
ported incidences of coronavirus-related dis-
crimination by the Asian Pacific Policy and 
Planning Council. We must better protect our 
vulnerable communities during times of tur-
moil, and it is even more egregious that many 
of these same victims are simultaneously 
fighting this pandemic as doctors, nurses, and 
other frontline providers. 
Therefore, I am proud to support this resolu-
tion that explicitly calls on all public officials to 
condemn and denounce all anti-Asian senti-
ment in any form. Additionally, I am pleased 
that this legislation recognizes that the health 
and safety of all Americans, no matter their 
background, must be our utmost priority. 
On behalf of the constituents of the 30th 
Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to 
support this resolution condemning anti-Asian 
sentiment during this pandemic, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NONDISCRIMINATION WITH REGARD TO 
REASONABLE 
ACCOMMODATIONS 
RELATED TO PREGNANCY. 
It shall be an unlawful employment practice 
for a covered entity to— 
(1) not make reasonable accommodations to 
the known limitations related to the pregnancy, 
childbirth, or related medical conditions of a 
qualified employee, unless such covered entity 
can demonstrate that the accommodation would 
impose an undue hardship on the operation of 
the business of such covered entity; 
(2) require a qualified employee affected by 
pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condi-
tions to accept an accommodation other than 
any 
reasonable 
accommodation 
arrived 
at 
through the interactive process referred to in 
section 5(7); 
(3) deny employment opportunities to a quali-
fied employee if such denial is based on the need 
of the covered entity to make reasonable accom-
modations to the known limitations related to 
the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical 
conditions of a qualified employee; 
(4) require a qualified employee to take leave, 
whether paid or unpaid, if another reasonable 
accommodation can be provided to the known 
limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, 
or related medical conditions of a qualified em-
ployee; or 
(5) take adverse action in terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment against a qualified em-
ployee on account of the employee requesting or 
using a reasonable accommodation to the known 
limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, 
or related medical conditions of the employee.

Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act. No one should have to choose 
between 
financial 
security 
and 
a 
healthy pregnancy. Unfortunately, our 
pregnancy antidiscrimination laws ur-
gently need to be updated to provide 
reasonable accommodations for work-
ers. 
Current Federal law does not clearly 
guarantee pregnant workers’ rights to 
reasonable 
accommodations 
in 
the 
workplace, such as water, seating, 
bathroom breaks, and lifting restric-
tions. These basic protections are crit-
ical to protecting pregnant workers 
from the tragic consequences of unsafe 
working conditions, and they are par-
ticularly important today, as early evi-
dence suggests that pregnancy leads to 
elevated risk of severe illness from 
COVID–19. 
In 2015, the Supreme Court allowed 
pregnant workers to bring claims for

reasonable accommodations under the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act in the 
landmark case of Young v. UPS. How-
ever, that decision set an unreasonably 
high standard for pregnancy discrimi-
nation. Under the Young standard, 
workers must prove that the accom-
modations they were denied were pro-
vided to other workers who were simi-
lar in their inability to work. 
This standard is onerous, in part, be-
cause it assumes that workers can ac-
cess their coworkers’ personal health 
information 
and 
establish 
a 
com-
parable group of workers. It also cre-
ates a perverse legal framework in 
which companies that treat all of their 
workers poorly can treat their preg-
nant workers poorly as well. 
Since the Young decision, courts 
have ruled against pregnant workers 
seeking accommodations most of the 
time. 
In the absence of Federal action, 
nearly three dozen States and local-
ities have filled the void by estab-
lishing their own protections for preg-
nant workers. This patchwork ap-
proach is bad for workers who are fre-
quently left without strong protections 
and bad for multistate employers who 
have to comply with different States’ 
workplace standards. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
is a bipartisan proposal that will fi-
nally establish clear, nationwide pro-
tections 
that 
guarantee 
pregnant 
workers the basic rights to reasonable 
accommodations. 
It will also grant victims of preg-
nancy discrimination the same rem-
edies as victims of discrimination on 
the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin under Federal civil 
rights laws. Similar to the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, employers are 
not required to make accommodations 
if it imposes an undue hardship on the 
employer’s business. 
This legislation has broad support 
across 
the 
political 
spectrum 
and 
across our communities. Labor unions, 
civil rights groups, and the business 
community, including the Chamber of 
Commerce, have all endorsed this pro-
posal. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter led by the nonprofit A 
Better Balance and over 200 worker ad-
vocacy organizations calling for Con-
gress to pass the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act. 
SEPTEMBER 14, 2020. 
Re Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: As organiza-
tions committed to promoting the health 
and economic security of our nation’s fami-
lies, we urge you to support the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act, a crucial maternal 
and infant health measure. This bipartisan 
legislation promotes healthy pregnancies 
and economic security for pregnant women 
and their families and strengthens the econ-
omy. 
In the last few decades, there has been a 
dramatic demographic shift in the work-
force. Not only do women now make up al-
most half of the workforce, but there are 
more pregnant workers than ever before and 
they are working later into their preg-
nancies. The simple reality is that some of 
these women—especially those in physically 
demanding jobs—will have a medical need 
for a temporary job-related accommodation 
in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy. 
Yet, too often, instead of providing a preg-
nant worker with an accommodation, her 
employer will fire her or push her onto un-
paid leave, depriving her of a paycheck and 
health insurance at a time when she needs 
them most. 
Additionally, pregnancy discrimination af-
fects women across race and ethnicity, but 
women of color and immigrants may be at 
particular risk. Latinas, Black women and 
immigrant women are more likely to hold 
certain inflexible and physically demanding 
jobs that can present specific challenges for 
pregnant workers, such as cashiers, home 
health aides, food service workers, and 
cleaners, making reasonable accommoda-
tions on the job even more important, and 
loss of wages and health insurance due to 
pregnancy discrimination especially chal-
lenging. American families and the Amer-
ican economy depend on women’s income: we 
cannot afford to force pregnant women out 
of work. 
In 2015, in Young v. United Parcel Service, 
the Supreme Court held that a failure to 
make accommodations for pregnant workers 
with medical needs will sometimes violate 
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 
(PDA). Yet, even after Young, pregnant 
workers are still not getting the accom-
modations they need to stay safe and 
healthy on the job and employers lack clar-
ity as to their obligations under the law. The 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will provide 
a clear, predictable rule: employers must 
provide reasonable accommodations for limi-
tations arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, 
or related medical conditions, unless this 
would pose an undue hardship. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is 
modeled after the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act (ADA) and offers employers and em-
ployees a familiar reasonable accommoda-
tion framework to follow. Under the ADA, 
workers with disabilities enjoy clear statu-
tory protections and need not prove how 
other employees are treated in order to ob-
tain necessary accommodations. Pregnant 
workers 
deserve 
the 
same 
clarity 
and 
streamlined process and should not have to 
ascertain how their employer treats others 
in order to understand their own accommo-
dation rights, as the Supreme Court’s ruling 
currently requires. 
Evidence from states and cities that have 
adopted laws similar to the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act suggests that providing this 
clarity reduces lawsuits and, most impor-
tantly, helps ensure that women can obtain 
necessary reasonable accommodations in a 
timely 
manner, 
which 
keeps 
pregnant 
women healthy and earning an income when 
they need it most. No woman should have to 
choose between providing for her family and 
maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would ensure 
that all women working for covered employ-
ers would be protected. 
The need for the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act is recognized across ideological and 
partisan lines. Thirty states and D.C. have 
adopted pregnant worker fairness measures 
with broad, and often unanimous, bipartisan 
support. Twenty-five of those laws have 
passed within the last seven years. These 
states include: Alaska, California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Ken-
tucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Massa-
chusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Caro-
lina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, 
West Virginia, Vermont, Virginia, and Wash-
ington. Lawmakers have concluded that ac-
commodating pregnant workers who need it 
is a measured approach grounded in family 
values and basic fairness. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is nec-
essary because it promotes long-term eco-
nomic security and workplace fairness. When 
accommodations allow pregnant women to 
continue to work, they can maintain income 
and seniority, while forced leave sets new 
mothers back with lost wages and missed ad-
vancement opportunities. When pregnant 
women are fired, not only do they and their 
families lose critical income, but they must 
fight extra hard to re-enter a job market 
that is especially brutal on the unemployed 
and on pregnant women. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is 
vital because it supports healthy preg-
nancies. The choice between risking a job 
and risking the health of a pregnancy is one 
no one should have to make. Women who 
cannot perform some aspects of their usual 
duties without risking their own health or 
the health of their pregnancy, but whose 
families cannot afford to lose their income, 
may continue working under dangerous con-
ditions. There are health consequences to 
pushing women out of the workforce as well. 
Stress from job loss can increase the risk of 
having a premature baby and/or a baby with 
low birth weight. In addition, women who 
are not forced to use their leave during preg-
nancy may have more leave available to 
take following childbirth, which in turn fa-
cilitates breastfeeding, bonding with and

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank Mr. NADLER 
and Mr. KATKO for their leadership on 
this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act. 
House Republicans have long sup-
ported protections in Federal law for 
all workers, but especially pregnant 
workers, and we believe employers 
should provide reasonable accommoda-
tions for pregnant workers, empow-
ering them to achieve their highest po-
tential. 
I speak not only as a concerned Con-
gresswoman on this issue but also as a 
mother and a grandmother. Discrimi-
nation of any type should not be toler-
ated, and no one should ever be denied 
an opportunity because of unlawful dis-
crimination. 
However, there are already impor-
tant protections under Federal law to 
prevent workplace discrimination, in-
cluding Federal laws that rightfully 
protect pregnant workers. 
Take the Pregnancy Discrimination 
Act and the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act, for example. These Federal 
laws ensure workers are not being un-
lawfully discriminated against and re-
ceive reasonable accommodations re-
lated to pregnancy, childbirth, or re-
lated medical conditions. 
My Republican colleagues and I agree 
with the underlying goal of H.R. 2694. 
That is why Republican Members on 
the Education and Labor Committee 
negotiated in good faith with Chairman 
SCOTT
to make important and nec-
essary improvements to the bill, and I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for his willing-
ness to do so. 
H.R. 2694, as introduced, did not re-
quire a pregnant worker, in order to be 
eligible for an accommodation, to be 
able to perform the essential functions 
of the job with a reasonable accommo-
dation. This is a sensible provision now 
included in the bill with additional lan-
guage that a temporary limitation, 
which prevents performance of an es-
sential function, may qualify for a rea-
sonable accommodation. 
Further, a definition of ‘‘known limi-
tations’’ related to pregnancy, child-
birth, or related medical conditions 
was also initially excluded, but the bill 
now includes such a definition and a re-
quirement 
that 
employees 
commu-
nicate the known limitation to the em-
ployer. This provision will help work-
ers and their employers understand 
their rights and responsibilities more 
clearly. 
Additionally, the original version of 
H.R. 2694 appeared to allow employees 
a unilateral veto over offered accom-
modations, but the bill now clarifies 
that reasonable accommodations will 
typically be determined through a bal-
ance and interactive dialogue between 
workers and employers, similar to the 
process implemented under the ADA. 
The bill also now includes a provision 
ensuring that if an employer makes a 
good faith effort to determine a reason-
able accommodation through the inter-
active process with the employee, the 
employer is not liable for damages. 
Finally, H.R. 2694, as introduced, did 
not limit its application to employers 
with 15 or more employees, as do title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act and the 
ADA. The bill now includes a 15-em-
ployee threshold. 
These bipartisan changes were con-
sidered and incorporated in the bill 
passed out of the committee in Janu-
ary. Unfortunately, despite the nec-
essary improvements made to the 
original bill, an important issue re-
mains unresolved. Namely, the legisla-
tion before us today does not currently 
include a longstanding provision from 
the Civil Rights Act that protects reli-
gious organizations from being forced 
to make employment decisions that 
conflict with their faith. 
To address this omission, Repub-
licans offered an amendment to include

this narrow but longstanding provision 
when the bill was considered by the 
committee. The Civil Rights Act pro-
tection, which already exists under 
current law, ensures religious organiza-
tions are not forced to make employ-
ment decisions that conflict with their 
faith. Unfortunately, committee Demo-
crats defeated this amendment on a 
party-line vote. 
The 
purpose 
of 
America’s 
non-
discrimination laws, and the agencies 
enforcing them, is to give all Ameri-
cans equal opportunities to succeed. 
That being said, overzealous govern-
ment intervention often causes more 
harm than good. In the case of H.R. 
2694, by failing to include a long-
standing Civil Rights Act provision, we 
are doing just that. As it is currently 
written, H.R. 2694 will create legal 
risks for religious organizations and 
their religiously backed employment 
decisions. 
Last year, a Democrat-invited wit-
ness at the committee hearing on H.R. 
2694 highlighted Kentucky’s recently 
enacted pregnancy accommodation law 
as a template for Congress to follow. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to read 
that again. Last year, a Democrat-in-
vited witness at the committee hearing 
on H.R. 2694 highlighted Kentucky’s re-
cently enacted pregnancy accommoda-
tion law as a template for Congress to 
follow. Kentucky’s law includes a reli-
gious 
organization 
protection 
very 
similar to the one found in the Civil 
Rights Act and incorporated in the Re-
publican-sponsored amendment. 
At least 16 States and the District of 
Columbia in their pregnancy discrimi-
nation or pregnancy accommodation 
laws also include a provision similar to 
the Civil Rights Act religious organiza-
tion protection. Even if certain Mem-
bers believe including such a provision 
in H.R. 2694 is somehow unnecessary, it 
would do no harm to include the pro-
tection and, in doing so, address the 
concerns I have raised. I remain per-
plexed why Chairman NADLER
and 
Chairman SCOTT
continue to oppose 
the current law protection. 
The First Amendment guarantees all 
Americans the freedom of religion, and 
for over 240 years, Supreme Court deci-
sions and laws written by Congress 
have maintained strong protections for 
religious liberty. H.R. 2694 should do so 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER), 
the sponsor of this legislation and the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, preg-
nancy is not a disability, but some-
times pregnant workers need an easy 
fix, such as a stool or an extra bath-
room break, to stay on the job. 
These accommodations are short in 
duration and typically cost very little 
to provide, but they can mean the dif-
ference between keeping your job or 
putting your pregnancy at risk. But for 
as long as women have been in the 
workforce, instead of being accommo-
dated, they have been fired or forced 
out on leave when they become preg-
nant. 
These policies have become even 
more pronounced during the COVID–19 
pandemic. We have seen a wave of em-
ployers firing pregnant workers rather 
than finding ways for them to safely 
return to work. 
These policies, as they too often do, 
are 
falling 
disproportionately 
on 
women of color and low-wage, hourly 
workers who suddenly find themselves 
without a paycheck, without health in-
surance, and pregnant in the middle of 
a global pandemic. 
The bipartisan Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act will fix how pregnancy ac-
commodation is treated under the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act. 
Courts have said that employers 
must provide an accommodation to a 
pregnant employee if they accommo-
date nonpregnant employees similar in 
their inability or ability to work. That 
means pregnant workers must have 
perfect knowledge of the medical and 
employment histories of every other 
employee in their workplace, which is 
nearly impossible. 
In fact, a recent study by A Better 
Balance found that in over two-thirds 
of cases, courts denied an accommoda-
tion because pregnant workers could 
not meet this test. 
I include in the RECORD a letter in 
support of this bill from A Better Bal-
ance. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
Re The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 
2694). 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of A Bet-
ter Balance, I write to express our strong 
support for the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act (‘‘PWFA’’; H.R. 2694). This legislation 
will ensure pregnant workers, particularly 
low-income workers and women of color, are 
not forced to choose between their paycheck 
and a healthy pregnancy. The bill will re-
quire employers to provide reasonable ac-
commodations for pregnant workers unless 
doing so would impose an undue hardship on 
the employer, similar to the accommodation 
standard already in place for workers with 
disabilities. 
Nearly forty-two years after the passage of 
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, pregnant 
workers still face rampant discrimination on 
the job and treatment as second-class citi-
zens, as I explained in detail in my Congres-
sional testimony before the House Education 
& Labor Civil Rights and Human Services 
Subcommittee in October 2019 as well as A 
Better Balance’s May 2019 report, Long Over-
due. We urge you to support healthy preg-
nancies, protect pregnant workers’ liveli-
hoods, and end the systemic devaluation of 
women of color and vote YES on the Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act and NO on any 
Motion to Recommit in connection with this 
legislation. 
A Better Balance is a national non-profit 
legal organization that advocates for women 
and families so they can care for themselves 
and their loved ones without sacrificing 
their financial security. Since our founding, 
we have seen day in and day out the injus-
tices that pregnant workers continue to face 
because they need modest, temporary preg-
nancy accommodations and have led the 
movement at the federal, state, and local 
level to ensure pregnant workers can receive 
the accommodations they need to remain 
healthy and working. As I wrote in my 2012 
Op-Ed in The New York Times ‘‘Pregnant 
and Pushed Out of Job,’’ which sparked the 
PWFA’s introduction in Congress, ‘‘For 
many women, a choice between working 
under unhealthy conditions and not working 
is no choice at all.’’ 
Through our free, national legal helpline, 
we have spoken with hundreds of pregnant 
workers, disproportionately women of color, 
who have been fired or forced out for needing 
accommodations, often stripping them of 
their health insurance when they need it 
most, driving them into poverty, and at 
times, even homelessness. Other women we 
have assisted were denied accommodations 
but needed to keep working to support them-
selves and their families and faced dev-
astating health consequences, including mis-
carriage, preterm birth, birth complications, 
and other maternal health effects. 
In the past few months alone, we have 
heard from women across the country who 
continue to face termination or are forced 
out for needing pregnancy accommodations. 
A retail store employee from Missouri who is 
pregnant and due in November 2020 called us 
after she was forced to quit her job because 
her employer refused to let her carry a water 
bottle on the retail floor even though she 
was experiencing severe dehydration due to 
hot temperatures in the store this summer. 
A massage therapist from Pennsylvania 
called us in June 2020 requesting to return to 
work on a part-time basis on the advice of 
her OB–GYN after experiencing cramping in 
her uterus. Her employer responded that 
they would not accommodate her and cut off 
all communication with her after that, forc-
ing her out of work just three months before 
she was due to give birth. A nurse we spoke 
with from Pennsylvania who was six months 
pregnant requested to avoid assignment to 
the COVID–19 unit. Though her hospital was 
not overwhelmed by the pandemic, had many 
empty beds, and other workers were being 
sent home, her employer refused her request 
and made heartless comments mocking her 
need for accommodation. She decided not to 
jeopardize her health and lost pay for miss-
ing those shifts as a result. She also worried 
about being called to the COVID unit shift 
constantly. 
Without the law on their side, these 
women had little legal recourse because they 
lived in a state without a state-level preg-
nant workers fairness law. On the other 
hand, when a pregnant worker in upstate 
New York—where a state pregnancy accom-
modation is already in place—requested to 
telecommute in June 2020 due to underlying 
health issues, she was quickly able to engage 
her employer in a good faith interactive 
process and her employer approved her re-
quest, allowing her to stay attached to the 
workforce and maintain a healthy pregnancy 
amidst the pandemic. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has certainly shone a spotlight on the 
critical need for clarity around pregnancy 
accommodations but let us be clear: the need 
for this law preceded our current public 
health crisis and will remain in place beyond 
the pandemic. 
CURRENT FEDERAL LAW IS FAILING PREGNANT 
WORKERS: THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS 
ACT IS THE SOLUTION 
Gaps in federal law mean many pregnant 
workers in need of accommodation are with-
out legal protection in non-PWFA states. As 
we explained in our report Long Overdue, 
‘‘While the P[regnancy] D[iscrimination] 
A[ct] bans pregnancy discrimination, it re-
quires employers to make accommodations 
only if they accommodate other workers, or

if an employee unearths evidence of dis-
crimination. The Americans with Disabil-
ities Act requires employers to provide rea-
sonable accommodations to workers with 
disabilities, which can include some preg-
nancy-related disabilities. However, preg-
nancy itself is not a disability, leaving a gap 
wherein many employers are in no way obli-
gated to accommodate pregnant workers in 
need of immediate relief to stay healthy and 
on the job.’’ 
Original analysis we conducted for Long 
Overdue found that even though the 2015 Su-
preme Court Young v. UPS case set a new 
legal standard for evaluating pregnancy ac-
commodation cases under the Pregnancy 
Discrimination Act, in over two-thirds of 
cases decided since Young employers were 
permitted to deny pregnancy workers accom-
modations under the Pregnancy Discrimina-
tion Act. That statistic, as devastating as it 
is, does not account for the vast majority of 
pregnant workers who do not have the re-
sources to vindicate their rights in court. 
Beyond being resource strapped, most preg-
nant workers we hear from do not have the 
desire to engage in time-consuming and 
stressful litigation. They want to be able to 
receive an accommodation so they can con-
tinue working at the jobs they care about 
while maintaining a healthy pregnancy. 
THE
PREGNANT
WORKERS
FAIRNESS
ACT
IS
A 
CRITICAL
ECONOMIC
SECURITY, 
MATERNAL 
HEALTH, AND RACIAL JUSTICE MEASURE 
Pregnant workers that are fired or pushed 
out for needing accommodations face signifi-
cant economic hardship. In addition to los-
ing their livelihood, many of these workers 
lose their health benefits at a time when 
they need them most, forcing them to switch 
providers, delay medical care, and/or face 
staggering health care costs associated with 
pregnancy and childbirth. We worked with 
one woman who was eight months pregnant 
and whose hours were cut after she needed an 
accommodation which meant she also lost 
her health insurance. As a result, she asked 
her doctor if they could induce her labor 
early so that she would not be left facing ex-
orbitant medical bills. In the long term, 
being pushed out for needing pregnancy ac-
commodations also exacerbates the gender 
wage gap, as it means losing out on many 
types of benefits such as 401K and retirement 
contributions, social security contributions, 
pensions, as well as opportunities for pro-
motion and growth. 
Most pregnant workers may not need ac-
commodations. However, for those who do, 
reasonable accommodations can avert sig-
nificant health risks. For instance, in a 
Health Impact Assessment of state level 
pregnant workers fairness legislation, the 
Louisville, Kentucky Department of Public 
Health and Wellness concluded, ‘‘Accommo-
dating pregnant workers, upon their request, 
is critical for reducing poor health outcomes 
. . . Improving birth outcomes makes a sus-
tainable impact for a lifetime of better 
health.’’ The report noted that those poor 
health outcomes can include miscarriage, 
preterm 
birth, 
low 
birth 
weight, 
preeclampsia (a serious condition and lead-
ing cause of maternal mortality), among 
other issues. According to the March of 
Dimes, in the U.S., nearly 1 in 10 babies are 
born pre-term and the preterm birth rate 
among Black women is nearly fifty percent 
higher than it is for all other women. 
Preterm birth/low birthweight is a leading 
cause of infant mortality in America. The 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a key 
measure to reduce poor maternal and infant 
health outcomes. 
Pregnancy accommodations are one of 
myriad solutions needed to address the 
Black maternal health crisis. Systemic rac-
ism has led to the shameful reality that 
Black women in this country are three to 
four times likelier to die from pregnancy-re-
lated causes than white women, and Black 
babies are more than two times as likely to 
die in the first year of life than white babies. 
At the same time, we know Black women 
also face devastating health consequences 
when they are unable to obtain needed preg-
nancy accommodations to maintain their 
health and the health of their pregnancies. 
When Tasha Murell, a Black woman who 
worked at a warehouse in Tennessee, re-
ceived a doctor’s note saying she needed a 
lifting restriction and complained of extreme 
stomach pain, she was forced to continue 
lifting on the job. One day, she told a super-
visor she was in pain and asked to leave 
early. Her manager said no. Tragically, she 
had a miscarriage the next day. Tasha was 
not alone. Three more of her co-workers, 
also Black, miscarried after supervisors dis-
missed their requests for reprieve from 
heavy lifting. As Cherisse Scott, CEO of 
Memphis-based Sister Reach, explained ‘‘It 
doesn’t surprise me that this is the culture 
of that workplace. I think it’s important to 
look at the fact that since we arrived here in 
chains, we [African-American women] were 
regarded as producers to fuel a labor force 
that couldn’t care less for us. . .’’ The Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act will ensure preg-
nant workers and their health are valued and 
that Black mothers, especially, are not 
treated as expendable on the job. 
THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS A BI-
PARTISAN BILL THAT HAS THE SUPPORT OF 
THIS COUNTRY’S LARGEST BUSINESS GROUPS 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is not 
a partisan bill. Not only does it have strong 
bipartisan support in Congress, but thirty 
states and five cities including Tennessee, 
Kentucky, South Carolina, West Virginia, Il-
linois, Nebraska, and Utah already have laws 
requiring employers to provide accommoda-
tions for pregnant employees. All of the laws 
passed in recent years are highly similar to 
the federal legislation, and all passed with 
bipartisan, and often unanimous, support. 
Many, 
including 
Tennessee’s 
and 
Ken-
tucky’s, were championed by Republican leg-
islators. 
Pregnant workers are a vital part of our 
economy. Three-quarters of women will be 
both pregnant and employed at some point 
during their lives. Ensuring pregnant work-
ers can remain healthy and attached to the 
workforce is an issue of critical importance, 
especially as this country faces an unprece-
dented economic crisis. That is why leading 
business groups like the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, Society for Human Resources 
Management, many major corporations, and 
local chambers around the country includ-
ing, Greater Louisville Inc., one of Ken-
tucky’s leading chambers of commerce, sup-
port this measure. The PWFA will provide 
much needed clarity in the law which will 
lead to informal and upfront resolutions be-
tween employers and employees and help 
prevent problems before they start. Further-
more, accommodations are short term and 
low cost. The Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act will help employers retain valuable em-
ployees and reduce high turnover and train-
ing costs. The reasonable accommodation 
framework is also borrowed from the Amer-
ican with Disabilities framework so employ-
ers are already familiar with the standard. 
Furthermore, keeping pregnant workers em-
ployed saves taxpayers money in the form of 
unemployment insurance and other public 
benefits. 
THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT USES A 
FAMILIAR
FRAMEWORK
THAT
PROVIDES
KEY 
PROTECTIONS
TO
PREGNANT
WORKERS
AND 
CLARITY TO EMPLOYERS 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has 
several key provisions that will address the 
inequality pregnant workers continue to face 
at work. Employers, including private em-
ployers with fifteen or more employees, will 
be required to provide reasonable accom-
modations to qualified employees absent 
undue hardship on the employer. Both the 
term 
‘‘reasonable 
accommodation’’ 
and 
‘‘undue hardship’’ have the same definition 
as outlined in the American with Disabilities 
Act. Similar to the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act, employers and employees must en-
gage in an interactive process in order to de-
termine an appropriate accommodation. In 
order to prevent employers from pushing 
pregnant employees out on leave when they 
need an accommodation, the bill specifies 
that an employer cannot require a pregnant 
employee to take leave if another reasonable 
accommodation can be provided. The bill 
also includes clear anti-retaliation language 
such that employers cannot punish pregnant 
workers for requesting or using an accommo-
dation. This is critical as many pregnant 
workers often do not ask for accommoda-
tions because they are afraid they will face 
repercussions for requesting or needing an 
accommodation. 
Critically, the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act is also very clear that a pregnant worker 
need not have a disability as defined by the 
Americans with Disabilities Act in order to 
merit accommodations under the law. Rath-
er, the bill indicates that pregnant workers 
with ‘‘known limitations related to preg-
nancy, childbirth, and related medical condi-
tions’’ are entitled to reasonable accom-
modations. ‘‘Known limitations’’ is defined 
as a ‘‘physical or mental condition related 
to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, 
childbirth, or related medical conditions 
that the employee or employee’s representa-
tive has communicated to the employer 
whether or not such condition meets the def-
inition of disability’’ as set forth in the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. This ad-
dresses two of the challenges the Americans 
with Disabilities Act has presented for preg-
nant workers: first, because pregnancy is not 
itself a disability under current disability 
law, a pregnant worker who has no complica-
tions but seeks an accommodation in order 
to avoid a complication, will not be able to 
get an accommodation under the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. Second, even though 
Congress expanded the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act in 2008, courts have interpreted 
the ADA Amendments Act in a way that did 
little to expand coverage even for those preg-
nant workers with serious health complica-
tions. As one court concluded in 2018, ‘‘Al-
though the 2008 amendments broadened the 
ADA’s definition of disability, these changes 
only have had a modest impact when applied 
to pregnancy-related conditions.’’ 
Now, more than ever, the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act is an urgent maternal 
health, racial justice, and economic security 
measure to keep pregnant workers healthy 
and earning a paycheck. We cannot delay 
justice and fairness for pregnant workers 
any longer. For the sake of this country’s 
pregnant workers and our nation’s families, 
we implore Congress to put aside its many 
differences and pass this legislation with a 
strong bipartisan vote. We ask every Member 
of Congress to vote YES on the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. It is long overdue. 
Sincerely, 
DINA BAKST, 
Co-Founder & Co-President, 
A Better Balance.

September 17, 2020 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, that 
is why the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act moves away from proving discrimi-
nation and creates an affirmative right 
to accommodation. Using the frame-
work and language of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, the bill requires 
employers to provide reasonable ac-
commodations to pregnant workers, as 
long as the accommodation does not 
impose an undue hardship on the em-
ployer. 
Courts know exactly how to interpret 
that language. Employers know ex-
actly what their responsibilities will 
be. But most importantly, women will 
have the certainty they can safely stay 
on the job. 
That is why over 200 organizations 
have endorsed the legislation and why 
30 States have passed pregnancy ac-
commodations laws similar to the 
PWFA. 
Providing 
reasonable 
accommoda-
tions to pregnant workers helps busi-
nesses, workers, and families. Passing 
this bill is long overdue. 
I thank Mr. KATKO for working with 
his Conference on this bill and Chair-
man SCOTT, Chairwoman BONAMICI, Eu-
nice Ikene, and the committee staff for 
shepherding the bill to the floor today. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO), 
the lead Republican sponsor of the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I am a 
Republican, and I rise in strong sup-
port of the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. 
I was proud to join Chairman NADLER 
and 
Representatives 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER, MCBATH, and SCOTT in intro-
ducing this bill. 
Simply 
put, 
no 
mother-to-be 
or 
mother in this country should have to 
choose between being a parent and 
keeping her job. 
Unfortunately, current Federal law 
lacks adequate protections to ensure 
pregnant workers are able to remain 
healthy in the workplace. With 30 
States having already passed laws to 
provide these protections, the need and 
support for a Federal standard is clear. 
This bipartisan bill provides preg-
nant workers with an affirmative right 
to reasonable accommodations in the 
workplace, while creating a clear and 
navigable standard for employees to 
follow. 
These accommodations, as simple as 
providing an employee with extra rest-
room breaks or a stool to sit on, should 
not be controversial. 
The arguments against this bill made 
by some Members of my own party are 
based on inaccuracies and wrongfully 
detract from the importance of this 
commonsense policy. 
Reflecting the widespread support for 
this legislation, the bill has received 
numerous endorsements from the busi-
ness community, as well as over 180 
women’s health, labor, and civil rights 
organizations. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter of support from a coa-
lition of business groups, including the 
Chamber of Commerce, the Society for 
Human Resource Management, and the 
National Retail Federation. 
SEPTEMBER 14, 2020. 
TO MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES: We urge Congress to pass the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). 
This bill would provide pregnant employees 
with important workplace protections while 
also making sure employers have clear and 
flexible options to ensure pregnant employ-
ees can remain at work for as long as they 
wish to do so. 
The 
Pregnant 
Workers 
Fairness 
Act 
(PWFA), as passed by the House Education 
and Labor Committee, is a balanced ap-
proach that clarifies an employer’s obliga-
tion to accommodate the known limitations 
of employees and job applicants that accom-
pany pregnancy. The PWFA uses an inter-
active, reasonable accommodation process 
similar to the Americans with Disabilities 
Act and specifies a pregnant employee may 
take leave only after the employer and em-
ployee have exhausted the possibility of 
other reasonable accommodations. 
This bipartisan bill is a strong reminder 
that through good faith negotiations, legis-
lative solutions to important workplace 
questions and problems can be found. We be-
lieve that Congress should pass the PWFA 
with no changes. 
Sincerely, 
H.R. POLICY ASSOCIATION, 
INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE 
ASSOCIATION, 
NATIONAL RETAIL 
FEDERATION, 
RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS 
ASSOCIATION, 
SOCIETY FOR HUMAN 
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, 
U.S. CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, an ex-
cerpt from that says that this bipar-
tisan bill is a strong reminder that 
through good faith negotiations, legis-
lative solutions to important work-
place questions and problems can be 
found. 
It is high time for our Nation to pro-
vide women in the workforce with the 
basic rights and respect they deserve. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
passage of this important legislation. 
b 1115 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, at the sole sub-
committee hearing on H.R. 2694 and at 
the 
committee 
markup, 
Democrat 
members encouraged the committee to 
follow the examples of States that had 
enacted 
pregnancy 
accommodation 
laws. However, the majority of these 
States have laws that are different 
from H.R. 2694 because they do include 
important protections for religious or-
ganizations. 
At least 16 States and the District of 
Columbia have pregnancy discrimina-
tion or pregnancy accommodations 
laws that include a religious organiza-
tion protection similar to section 702 of 
the Civil Rights Act. The States in-
clude Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, 
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
It is a broad range of States in the 
country. 
Our attitude is the States can do 
this, and we already have very, very 
good protections at the Federal level. 
Unless we are going to follow the ex-
ample of the States and include this 
very important section 702 of the Civil 
Rights Act, then maybe we should 
leave this up to the States. We should 
be following their example and put 
that provision in this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, section 702 is not re-
pealed by this law, and according to 
the Congressional Research Service, 
which studied this issue, all in all, 
State statutes providing for pregnancy 
accommodation generally incorporate 
generalized longstanding religious ex-
emptions. In most cases, exemptions 
allow religious institutions to favor co-
religionists. States typically do not 
enact separate or specialized religious 
exemptions for pregnancy accommoda-
tion laws. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Civil Rights and Human 
Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2694, the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
As a mom and a policymaker, I know 
how important it is to protect the eco-
nomic security of pregnant workers 
and working families; yet 41 years after 
the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimi-
nation Act, Federal law falls short of 
guaranteeing that all pregnant workers 
have 
reasonable 
workplace 
accom-
modations to protect their health and 
the health of their baby. 
Reasonable 
accommodations 
can 
range from providing seating, water, 
and light duty to excusing pregnant 
workers from tasks that involve dan-
gerous substances. But when pregnant 
workers do not have access to the ac-
commodations they need, they are at 
risk of losing their job, being denied a 
promotion, or not being hired in the 
first place. 
Unfortunately, pregnant workers suf-
fer workplace discrimination at alarm-
ing rates. According to a survey from 
the National Partnership for Women 
and Families, more than 60 percent of 
the women have experienced pregnancy 
discrimination on the job. Women of 
color are overrepresented in low-wage, 
physically demanding jobs and are, 
therefore, disproportionately harmed 
by a lack of access to reasonable ac-
commodation. 
Last year, I chaired an Education 
and Labor Committee hearing on preg-
nancy discrimination. We heard very

compelling testimony demonstrating 
that far too many pregnant workers 
are denied access to reasonable work-
place accommodations despite the ex-
isting Federal law providing for equal 
treatment on the job. 
Now my home State of Oregon is 
helping to lead the way by passing bi-
partisan legislation that requires rea-
sonable accommodations for pregnant 
workers. The new law has protected 
pregnant women and also provided cer-
tainty to the business community. But 
we need to make sure that all pregnant 
workers, regardless of where they live, 
can access the protections they need to 
stay safe and healthy in the workplace. 
The bipartisan Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act is our opportunity to ad-
dress pregnancy discrimination and 
protect the health, well-being, and eco-
nomic security of pregnant and par-
enting workers and their families. By 
clarifying the right of pregnant work-
ers to fair treatment in the workplace, 
we will finally guarantee that pregnant 
workers get the accommodations they 
need without facing fear of discrimina-
tion or retaliation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
SCOTT and Chairman NADLER for their 
leadership. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bipartisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a letter from the National 
Women’s Law Center in support of this 
legislation. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
the National Women’s Law Center, we urge 
you to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act (H.R. 2694) and vote no on any motion to 
recommit. The National Women’s Law Cen-
ter (‘‘the Center’’) has worked for over 45 
years to advance and protect women’s equal-
ity and opportunity—and since its founding 
has fought for the rights of pregnant women 
in the workplace. For the last eight years, 
the Center has been a leader in advocating 
for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and 
for pregnancy accommodation protections in 
states across the country. The Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act would clarify the law 
for employers and employees alike, requiring 
employers to make reasonable accommoda-
tions for limitations arising out of preg-
nancy, childbirth, and related medical condi-
tions, just as they already do for disabilities. 
Providing 
accommodations 
ensures 
that 
women can work safely while pregnant in-
stead of being pushed out of work at a time 
when their families need their income the 
most. 
Even before the COVID–19 pandemic, preg-
nant workers were all too often denied medi-
cally 
needed 
accommodations—including 
simple accommodations like a stool to sit on 
during a long shift or a bottle of water at a 
workstation. As the United States enters the 
sixth month of COVID–19 lockdown, the need 
for clarity regarding employers’ obligations 
to provide accommodations for pregnant 
workers has only increased. Across the coun-
try, as new information emerges about the 
risks COVID–19 poses during pregnancy, 
pregnant workers are urgently seeking, and 
far too often being denied, accommodations 
like proper personal protective equipment, 
telework, moving to a less crowded work 
area or changing start times so as not to risk 
riding public transit during peak hours. The 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act uses an al-
ready-familiar framework modeled on the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to 
ensure that when such a request is made, 
employers and employees can engage in an 
interactive process to determine whether the 
employee’s pregnancy related limitations 
can be reasonably accommodated without an 
undue hardship to the employer. This will 
help ensure that employees are not forced to 
choose between a paycheck and a healthy 
pregnancy. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will 
close gaps and clarify ambiguities in the law 
that have left too many pregnant workers 
unprotected for too long. The Pregnancy Dis-
crimination Act (PDA), passed in 1978, guar-
antees the right not to be treated adversely 
at work because of pregnancy, childbirth, or 
related medical conditions, and the right to 
be treated at least as well as other employ-
ees ‘‘not so affected but similar in their abil-
ity or inability to work.’’ Unfortunately, 
many courts interpreted the PDA narrowly 
and allowed employers to refuse to accom-
modate workers with medical needs arising 
out of pregnancy, even when they routinely 
accommodated other physical limitations. In 
Young v. UPS, the Supreme Court held that 
when an employer accommodates workers 
who are similar to pregnant workers in their 
ability to work, it cannot refuse to accom-
modate pregnant workers who need it simply 
because it ‘‘is more expensive or less conven-
ient’’ to accommodate pregnant women too. 
The Young decision was an important vic-
tory for pregnant workers, but the standard 
it set out still left many important questions 
unanswered and created uncertainty for em-
ployers and employees about when exactly 
the PDA requires pregnancy accommoda-
tions. In addition, the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (ADA) requires employers to 
make reasonable accommodations for em-
ployees with disabilities. However, courts 
have consistently held that pregnancy is not 
a disability. The Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act would fill the holes left in these protec-
tions with a common-ground and common-
sense approach that ensures pregnant work-
ers are accommodated when the accommoda-
tions they need are reasonable and do not 
pose an undue hardship to employers. 
Accommodating pregnant workers is not 
only good for working women and families, 
it is good for business. Moreover, today, 
women make up about half the workforce. 
More women are continuing to work while 
they are pregnant, through later stages of 
pregnancy. 
For 
example, 
two-thirds 
of 
women who had their first child between 2006 
and 2008 worked during pregnancy, and 88 
percent of these first-time mothers worked 
into their last trimester. When employers 
accommodate pregnant workers, businesses 
reap the benefits of avoiding the costs of 
turnover and keeping experienced employees 
on the job. And since pregnancy is tem-
porary, pregnancy accommodations are, by 
definition, short-term; many of these accom-
modations are low and no cost. 
The time is now to pass the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. Thirty states and the 
District of Columbia have enacted provisions 
explicitly granting pregnant employees the 
right to accommodations at work, from Mas-
sachusetts, New York, and California, to 
South Carolina, Utah, Nebraska, West Vir-
ginia and Tennessee. Millions of pregnant 
workers have benefited from these protec-
tions, but a pregnant employee’s ability to 
work safely should not depend on where she 
lives. 
We strongly urge you to support pregnant 
workers by voting for the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act and rejecting any motion to re-
commit. If you have any questions, please 
contact me. 
Sincerely, 
EMILY J. MARTIN, 
Vice 
President 
for 
Education & Work-
place 
Justice, 
Na-
tional Women’s Law

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, at the Rules Com-
mittee hearing on H.R. 2694 earlier this 
week, the bill’s sponsor, Chairman 
NADLER, said it is not necessary to in-
corporate into H.R. 2694 the Civil 
Rights Act’s provision that protects re-
ligious organizations. He stated that 
because H.R. 2694 does not repeal this 
provision, it will still be effective if 
H.R. 2694 becomes law. 
Color me skeptical; I strongly dis-
agree. H.R. 2694 will create legal jeop-
ardy for religious organizations, as I 
have previously stated. 
But for the sake of argument, let’s 
assume the provision is superfluous. 
What would be the harm in including 
the Civil Rights Act provision in H.R. 
2694? At worst, the provision will be du-
plicative with the Civil Rights Act, 
causing no harm to workers or employ-
ers. 
Let’s remember that the Americans 
with Disability Act of 1990, better 
known as the ADA, includes a religious 
organization protection similar to the 
one in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 
ADA provision has caused no harm. 
My conclusion is that the key spon-
sors of H.R. 2694 are saying the quiet 
part out loud in their opposition to the 
religious organization protection in the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
At the Rules Committee hearing this 
week, Chairman SCOTT said the reli-
gious organization protection should 
not be included in H.R. 2694 because it 
is overinclusive and would provide too 
much protection. Is the chairman say-
ing that the existing Civil Rights Act 
protection for religious organizations 
should also be repealed? Again, this is 
a provision that has been in law for 55 
years. 
As I have stated previously, the long-
standing Civil Rights Act religious or-
ganization protection should be added 
to H.R. 2694. At worst, it would do no 
harm, and, at best, it will prevent a re-
ligious organization from being re-
quired to violate its faith. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.

Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his incredible support as chair of

Madam Speaker, over 40 years ago, 
after the Pregnancy Discrimination 
Act provided civil rights protections to 
pregnant people, it is shameful that we 
still must address this issue today. 
Every year, roughly 250,000 people in 
America are denied basic accommoda-
tions to continue their work once preg-
nant; and when these simple temporary

adjustments in their work activities 
are denied, many face being fired or are 
forced to take unpaid leave simply to 
protect their health and the health of 
their pregnancy. 
This discrimination can take many 
forms, but its impacts can be deadly. 
And, of course, these burdens fall dis-
proportionately on people and women 
of color who are overrepresented in 
low-wage jobs that are physically de-
manding, lack adequate workforce pro-
tections, or both. This is also one of 
the key reasons why I founded the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus with 
Congresswoman 
LAUREN
UNDERWOOD 
last year. 
I am pleased that the House is taking 
up the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
today, which will create a clear set of 
rules for employers to follow that re-
quires them to provide accommoda-
tions for pregnant workers to continue 
to work and support their families. 
So today we are sending the message 
that nowhere in America—nowhere in 
America—should you have to worry 
about the health of your pregnancy be-
cause your employer won’t accommo-
date you. Today we will tell millions of 
Americans that pregnancy won’t pre-
vent them from taking their dreams as 
far as they can take them.

Health Coalition, a group of public

maternal health organizations out-
lining their support for this legislation. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: As organizations 
dedicated to ending racial injustice and sys-
temic racism, including dismantling the rac-
ism that contributes to this country’s Black 
maternal health crisis, we write in strong 
support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act (H.R. 2694). Congress must do all it can 
to end the prejudice Black pregnant workers 
and pregnant workers of color continue to 
face in the workplace. This includes making 
sure when pregnant workers voice a need for 
reasonable accommodations that those needs 
are met rather than penalized and that the 
workplace is an environment where pregnant 
workers of color do not fear asking for ac-
commodations. 
The Black Maternal Health crisis remains 
frighteningly persistent and requires imme-
diate attention and multi-faceted solutions. 
Black women experience maternal mortality 
rates three to four times higher than white 
women. The circumstances surrounding this 
alarming statistic can often be attributed to 
a lack of access to care, including due to in-
flexible workplaces, and deep biases in racial 
understanding. Various social determinants 
such as health, education, and economic sta-
tus drastically influence the outcomes of 
pregnancy for Black women leading to se-
vere pregnancy-related complications. As 
the Black Mamas Matter Alliance has point-
ed out ‘‘Health is determined in part by our 
access to social and economic opportunities, 
the resources and supports that are available 
in the places where we live, and the safety of 
our workplaces . . . however, disparities in 
these conditions of daily life give some peo-
ple better opportunities to be healthy than 
others.’’ Black pregnant workers along with 
Latinx and immigrant women are dispropor-
tionately likely to work in physically de-
manding jobs that may lead to workers need-
ing modest accommodations to ensure a 
healthy pregnancy. Too often, however, 
those requests are refused or ignored, forcing 
pregnant workers of color to disproportion-
ately contend with unsafe working condi-
tions. 
Black mothers have among the highest 
labor force participation rates in the country 
and 80 percent of Black mothers are their 
family’s primary breadwinner,’’ Yet, histori-
cally, Black women have been exploited in 
the workplace, and that exploitation con-
tinues to this day. Though Black women 
only comprise 14.3 percent of the population, 
nearly thirty percent of pregnancy discrimi-
nation 
complaints 
are 
filed 
by 
Black 
women.’’ This is because of the multiple 
forms of discrimination Black workers and 
other workers of color too often face in the 
workplace. As scholar Nina Banks has noted, 
‘‘The legacy of black women’s employment 
in industries that lack worker protections 
has continued today since black women are 
concentrated in low-paying, inflexible serv-
ice occupations ...’’ Black women in low 
wage jobs working during pregnancy face lit-
tle support from employers when safeguards 
do not address pregnancy related accom-
modations. Faced with the threat of termi-
nation, loss of health insurance, or other 
benefits, Black pregnant people are often 
forced to keep working which can com-
promise their health and the health of their 
pregnancy. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will 
positively impact Black women’s health and 
economic security. When Black pregnant 
people must continue working without ac-
commodations, they risk miscarriage, exces-
sive bleeding, and other devastating health 
consequences. Black women have the highest 
incidence of preterm birth and yet we know 
that workplace accommodations such as re-
ducing heavy lifting, bending, or excessive 
standing can help prevent preterm birth, the 
leading cause of infant mortality in this 
country. 
Black women are also at higher risk of 
preeclampsia, which is one of the leading 
causes of maternal mortality. We are still 
learning about how to prevent this dan-
gerous medical condition, yet we know that 
simply allowing workers to take bathroom 
breaks can prevent urinary tract infections 
which 
are 
‘‘strongly 
associated 
with 
preeclampsia.’’ Similarly, ensuring pregnant 
workers can drink a sufficient amount of 
water can also help pregnant workers main-
tain their blood pressure, which is critically 
important since hypertensive disorders (high 
blood pressure) are also a leading cause of 
maternal morbidity and mortality. By put-
ting a national pregnancy accommodation 
standard in place, the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act has the potential to improve 
some of the most serious health con-
sequences Black pregnant people experience. 
Furthermore, the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act will help remove one of the many 
barriers Black pregnant people face at work 
by ensuring they are afforded immediate re-
lief under the law, and not thrown into fi-
nancial dire straits for needing pregnancy 
accommodations. 
Congress has the opportunity to pass legis-
lation to support rather than subjugate 
Black pregnant workers and workers of 
color. We urge every member of the House of 
Representatives to support the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act and by extension, the 
health and economic wellbeing of Black 
pregnant workers and pregnant workers of 
color. 
Thank you for your time and attention.

DEAR
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS: Women’s 
labor force participation is critical to the 
strength of our companies, the growth of our 
economy and the financial security of most 
modern families. The private sector and our 
nation’s elected leaders must work together 
to ensure that working women and families 
have the protections and opportunities they 
need to participate fully and equally in the 
workplace. Twenty leading companies from 
across states and industries have come to-
gether in support of pregnant workers and 
their families by calling on Congress to pass 
H.R. 2694, the bipartisan Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act, without delay. 
More than 40 years ago, Congress passed 
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 
which made it illegal to discriminate against 
most working people on the basis of preg-
nancy, childbirth or related medical condi-
tions. Since that time, 30 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia now require certain em-
ployers to provide accommodations to preg-
nant employees at work. It’s now time to 
clarify and strengthen existing federal pro-
tections for pregnant workers by passing the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bill 
would ensure that pregnant workers who 
need reasonable accommodations can receive 
them and continue to do their jobs. 
As a business community, we strive to cre-
ate more equitable workplaces and better

Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, as a 
former lawyer who worked long hours 
during two pregnancies, it is out-
rageous to me that, in 2020, 100 years 
after women finally secured the power 
to vote, current law does not explicitly 
guarantee every pregnant worker the 
right to a reasonable accommodation 
at work. 
I had the luxury of a desk and chair 
and an office door that closed—not all 
workers do. 
Currently, in order to get an accom-
modation, a pregnant worker must 
show that other nonpregnant employ-
ees are similarly accommodated. It is 
beyond absurd. Because the challenges 
of pregnancy are so unique, it is often 
difficult to find comparable nonpreg-
nant workers who received similar ac-
commodations. 
Fatigue, vomiting, back pain, and 
frequent urination are more than just 
nuisances; these are symptoms that 
can make it impossible to work with-
out accommodation. And that is with-
out mentioning the more serious condi-
tions related to pregnancy. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
secures for women basic rights to earn 
a living without jeopardizing their 
health or the baby’s. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TORRES SMALL of New Mexico). The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, it pro-
tects workers with known limitations 
related to childbirth, because it is time 
that we recognize that mental health 
conditions like postpartum depression 
are real and tangible medical condi-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I thank leadership, 
the ACLU, and the Chamber of Com-
merce for endorsing this bill. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER), a distinguished member of 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I had 
a high-risk pregnancy, complicated by 
both advanced maternal age and 24 
years of type 1 diabetes. I worked until 
2 days before my C-section, and I am so 
grateful that my employer allowed for 
minor accommodations which allowed 
me to continue to work. 
Women are half of our workforce, and 
75 percent of those women will become 
pregnant at some point. Supporting 
women during their pregnancies is just 
as important as prenatal care, immuni-
zations, affordable childcare, and pub-
lic education. We can do that by pass-
ing this bill, as well as supporting pro-
grams like WIC that help new and ex-
pectant parents to provide the proper 
nutrition and developmental supports 
to their babies. 
We all benefit from healthy preg-
nancy outcomes. 
It costs us all when a baby is born 
prematurely and requires months in in-
tensive care. 
It costs us all when a fetus is exposed 
to toxins in utero because we couldn’t 
protect the mother from an unhealthy 
environment and that child then suf-
fers a lifetime of damage that will re-
quire public support. 
It costs us all when half of our work-
force may lose or leave their jobs be-
cause pregnant women and mothers are 
not welcomed or supported in the 
workplace. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from over 40 public 
health organizations, clinicians, and 
maternal health providers who support 
this bill. 
SEPTEMBER 14, 2020. 
Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned 
public health professionals, health care clini-
cians, and maternal health organizations 
dedicated to the health and well-being of 
mothers, infants, and families enthusiasti-
cally support the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act (H.R. 2694). Modeled after the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, the bill would require 
employers to provide reasonable, temporary 
workplace 
accommodations 
to 
pregnant 
workers as long as the accommodation does 
not impose an undue hardship on the em-
ployer. This bill is critically important be-
cause no one should have to choose between 
having a healthy pregnancy and a paycheck. 
Three-quarters of women will be pregnant 
and employed at some point in their lives. 
Most pregnant workers can expect a routine 
pregnancy 
and 
healthy 
birth. 
However, 
health care professionals have consistently 
recommended that some pregnant individ-
uals make adjustments in their work activi-
ties to sustain a healthy pregnancy and pre-
vent adverse pregnancy outcomes, including 
preterm birth or miscarriage. These medi-
cally necessary workplace accommodations 
can include allowing additional bathroom 
breaks, opportunities to stay hydrated, lift-
ing restrictions, or access to a chair or stool 
to decrease time spent standing. 
Unfortunately, too many pregnant work-
ers, particularly pregnant people of color, 
face barriers to incorporating even these 
small changes to their workdays. Workplace 
accommodations help safeguard a healthy 
pregnancy or prevent harm to a higher-risk 
pregnancy. Across the country, pregnant 
workers continue to be denied simple, no- 
cost or low-cost, temporary adjustments in 
their work settings or activities and instead 
risk being fired or forced to take unpaid 
leave to preserve the health of their preg-
nancy. Low-wage pregnant workers in phys-
ically demanding jobs, which are dispropor-
tionately occupied by people of color, feel 
the impact most acutely. This impossible 
choice forces many pregnant workers to con-
tinue 
working 
without 
accommodations, 
putting women and their pregnancies at risk 
of 
long-lasting 
and 
severe 
health 
con-
sequences. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a 
measured approach to a serious problem. As 
public health professionals, health care clini-
cians, and maternal health organizations, we 
understand the importance of reasonable 
workplace accommodations to ensure that 
pregnant persons can continue to provide for 
their families and have safe and healthy 
pregnancies. We collectively urge swift pas-
sage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, the 
bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act simply ensures that reasonable ac-

the economy is stronger, family out-
comes are better, and children can 
start life strong and healthy. Everyone

Mr.

Madam 
Speaker, can you advise how much 
time is remaining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 15 minutes

North Carolina has 181⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of

Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee 
on 
Labor, 
Health 
and 
Human Services, Education and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the bill, and I submit 
for the RECORD this letter from the Na-
tional Partnership for Women & Fami-
lies, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy 
organization committed to improving 
the lives of women and families by 
achieving equity for all women. 
SEPTEMBER 15, 2020. 
The National Partnership for Women & 
Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advo-
cacy organization committed to improving 
the lives of women and families by achieving 
equity for all women. Since our creation as 
the Women’s Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we 
have fought for every significant advance for 
equal opportunity in the workplace, includ-
ing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 
and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 
1993 (FMLA). We write today in strong sup-
port for H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act. This bipartisan legislation will 
support pregnant workers on the job, im-
proving women’s and families’ economic se-
curity and promoting healthier pregnancies. 
More than 40 years ago, Congress passed 
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 
outlawing discrimination on the basis of 
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical 
conditions. Yet pregnancy discrimination is 
still widespread and impacts pregnant work-
ers across industry, race, ethnicity and juris-
diction. Nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimina-
tion charges were filed with the U.S. Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission 
(EEOC) and state-level fair employment 
practice agencies between 2010 and 2015, and 
the reality of pregnancy discrimination is 
likely much worse than illustrated by EEOC 
charges. As a result of this discrimination, 
too many women must choose between their 
paychecks and a healthy pregnancy. That’s 
not a choice anyone should have to make. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would 
create a clear policy standard requiring em-
ployers to provide reasonable accommoda-
tions to pregnant workers. Support for a law 
like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is 
nearly universal and bipartisan. Eighty-nine 
perfect of voters favor this bill, including 69 
percent of voters who strongly favor it. Just 
this Congress, twenty-eight leading private 
sector employers endorsed the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act in an open letter to 
Congress. 
More than 85 percent of women will be-
come mothers at some point in their work-
ing lives. And sometimes, an accommodation 
is needed in order for a pregnant worker to 
continue performing their job. Those accom-
modations are often small changes to their 
work environment such as additional bath-
room breaks, a stool to sit on or the ability 
to have a water bottle at their work station. 
Although 
minor, 
these 
accommodations 
allow pregnant workers to stay in the work-
force and continue to provide for themselves 
and their families. When pregnant workers 
are fired, demoted, or forced into unpaid 
leave, they and their families lose critical 
income, and they may struggle to re-enter a 
job market that is particularly harsh for 
people who are currently or were recently 
pregnant. 
Pregnancy discrimination affects women 
across race and ethnicity, but women of 
color and immigrants are at particular risk. 
They are disproportionately likely to work 
in jobs and industries where accommoda-
tions during pregnancy are not often pro-
vided (such as home health aides, food serv-
ice workers, package handlers and cleaners). 
Black women are much more likely than 
white women to file pregnancy discrimina-
tion charges; they are also at a higher risk 
for pregnancy-related complications like 
pre-term labor, preeclampsia and hyper-
tensive disorders, making reasonable accom-
modations on the job even more important, 
and loss of wages and health insurance due 
to pregnancy discrimination especially chal-
lenging. 
To date, thirty-one states including the 
District of Columbia and four cities have 
passed laws requiring employers to provide 
reasonable 
accommodations 
to 
pregnant 
workers. But the ability to maintain a 
healthy pregnancy and keep a job should not 
depend on where a pregnant person works. 
Women are a crucial part of the workforce 
and their participation matters for the 
growth of our economy and for the stability 
and wellbeing of families nationwide. The 
Pregnant 
Workers 
Fairness 
Act 
would 
strengthen existing federal protections, en-
sure more equitable workplaces and allow 
women to remain in the workforce and main-
tain their economic stability while having 
the accommodations necessary for healthy 
pregnancies. It is time to clarify and 
strengthen existing federal protections for 
pregnant workers by passing the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. 
Sincerely, 
DEBRA L. NESS, 
President, National Partnership for 
Women & Families. 
Ms. DELAURO. The bipartisan Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act is vital for 
women like Regina Scates, a fire-
fighter in Connecticut. She was placed 
on unrequested, unpaid leave when she 
got pregnant, even though she was still 
capable of performing light duty work. 
She was left to ask: ‘‘How am I going 
to be able to feed my family?’’ 
Today, 88 percent of first-time moth-
ers work in the third trimester, yet an 
estimated 250,000 requests for reason-
able accommodations go unheard and 
unapproved. And women of color are 
disproportionately 
impacted, 
being 
overrepresented in low-wage jobs where 
accommodations during pregnancy are 
not often provided, like healthcare 
aides and food service workers. 
So we seek to build on the 1978 Preg-
nancy Discrimination Act, the first so-
cial policy ever to be enacted into law 
to provide protection to working moth-
ers. And we must. 
Decisions from the Supreme Court 
have made it exceedingly difficult for 
women to get reasonable accommoda-
tions under current law even when the 
adjustments could be as small as a 
chair and the stakes could be as enor-
mous as a miscarriage or preterm 
birth. 
It is modeled after the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. It establishes a 
clear-cut right to reasonable accom-
modations for all public sector employ-
ees and all private sector employees at 
companies with more than 15 workers. 
This is not just an economic ques-
tion. It is a moral question. Like many 
of you, I was horrified by reports that 
doctors at ICE detention centers per-
formed hysterectomies on women with-
out their consent. It is unimaginable. 
It is inhumane and diminishes, dehu-
manizes and disrespects women. 
To all who preach a culture of life, to 
all who champion the dignity of work, 
I say let us seize the opportunity be-
fore us to protect life. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, to 
all who preach a culture of life, to all 
who champion the dignity of work, I 
say, Let us seize this opportunity be-
fore us to protect life, to respect 
women, to protect pregnant women at 
work and to do so with the strength, 
not of just words, but with the strength 
of the law. Let us pass this bipartisan 
bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for bringing this vital legislation to 
the floor. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
will ensure that no woman is unfairly 
fired or forced to risk the health of 
themselves or their pregnancy just to 
earn a paycheck. Our mothers deserve 
these Federal protections. 
We want all to support our working 
mothers. Allowing them simple accom-
modations can ensure that they are 
able to continue working and provide a 
living for themselves and for their fam-
ilies. 
Twenty-seven States have already 
passed laws that require certain em-
ployers to provide accommodations to 
pregnant women. It is time for federal 
action to ensure that all pregnant 
women are protected from discrimina-
tion and continue to support their fam-
ilies. This legislation is supported by 
both women’s health groups and the 
business community. 
I have here a letter from the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce voicing strong 
support for this legislation, and I sub-
mit this letter for the RECORD.

will consider including votes on this legisla-
tion in our How They Voted scorecard. 
Employers currently face great uncer-
tainty about whether, and how, they are re-
quired to accommodate pregnant workers. 
The revised PWFA would clarify an employ-
er’s obligation to accommodate a pregnant 
employee or applicant with a known limita-
tion that interferes with her ability to per-
form some essential functions of her posi-
tion. 
The PWFA takes advantage of the widely 
known and accepted interactive process asso-
ciated with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) that is used to find reasonable ac-
commodations for employees covered by the 
ADA, and also carries forward the 15-or- 
more-employee threshold from the ADA. 
The Chamber worked extensively with ad-
vocates for this bill to find bipartisan agree-
ment. This important bill is a reminder that 
through good faith negotiations, legislative 
solutions to important questions and prob-
lems can be achieved. We urge the House to 
pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
Sincerely, 
JACK HOWARD. 
Ms. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
legislation. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY), the chair of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his lead-
ership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill. As a member of the New York 
City Council, I became the first woman 
in history to give birth while in office 
as a council member. There had been 
many men who had become fathers, but 
I was the first woman. So I know first-
hand how physically draining and 
stressful it is to work while pregnant. 
Some of the only good news coming 
out of the COVID–19 lockdown is that 
there has been a dramatic drop in the 
number of premature births. 
In Denmark, the rate of babies born 
preterm dropped by 90 percent during 
the lockdown. So the accommodations 
in this bill can keep mothers and ba-
bies safe. It is strongly pro-family. 
This bill is an incredible step in the 
right direction. Once we ratify the 
Equal Rights Amendment, we will have 
an anchor in the Constitution to pass 
even 
more 
robust 
protections 
for 
women and families. 
I urge a strong ‘‘yes.’’ It is long over-
due. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my

(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act, a bipartisan proposal that finally 
secures clear protections for pregnant 
workers. 
In the year 2020, Federal protections 
for pregnant workers are stuck in the 
1950s. 
Current law does not explicitly guar-
antee all pregnant workers the right to 
reasonable accommodations so they 
can work without jeopardizing their 
pregnancies. Reasonable accommoda-
tions like a glass of water or a place to 
sit. These are sensible and, quite frank-
ly, simple requests. 
I was pregnant with my twins and 
then again with my youngest daughter 
when I served in the State legislature. 
While there were obstacles, I could ask 
for accommodations and did so without 
fear, but it was still a struggle to se-
cure them, even for a State legislator. 
Unfortunately, this is the case for 
many pregnant workers. 
We know that COVID–19 has only ex-
acerbated 
health 
inequalities 
for 
women, especially women of color. In 
fact, the most common low-paid jobs 
for women, like nurses and home 
health aides, are on the pandemic front 
lines. 
Pregnant women across this country 
are literally putting their lives on the 
line. Yet, too often, instead of pro-
viding a pregnant worker with an ac-
commodation routinely given to other 
workers, her employer will fire her, de-
priving her of a paycheck and health 
insurance at a time when she needs 
them most. 
Pregnant workers must never have to 
choose between maintaining a healthy 
pregnancy and losing their jobs, espe-
cially now when both their health and 
economic security are crucial. 
The demand for the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act even stretches across 
religious, ideological and party lines. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a letter on behalf of faith- 
based organizations in support of this 
vital legislation. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
undersigned religious and faith-based organi-
zations representing a diversity of faith tra-
ditions and communities across the nation, 
we write today in support of healthy work-
place environments and conditions for preg-
nant workers. We urge you to pass the Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). Peo-
ple of faith across the ideological spectrum 
understand that prioritizing the health and 
safety of pregnant workers should not be a 
partisan issue. The Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act would ensure that pregnant workers 
can continue safely working to support their 
families during a pregnancy. The bill re-
quires employers to make the same sort of 
accommodations for pregnant workers as are 
already in place for workers with disabil-
ities. 
Our faith traditions affirm the dignity of 
pregnant individuals and the moral impera-
tive of ensuring their safety. We also affirm 
the dignity of work and the obligation to 
treat workers justly. It is immoral for an 
employer to force a worker to choose be-
tween a healthy pregnancy and earning a liv-
ing. By passing the bipartisan Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694), Congress 
will ensure that workers who arc pregnant 
will be treated fairly in the workforce and 
can continue earning income to support 
themselves and their families. Efforts to dis-
tract from the central goal of ensuring preg-
nant workers can maintain their health and 
the health of their pregnancies by inserting 
unnecessary, harmful, and politically divi-
sive language into this bill undermines our 
obligation 
to 
protect 
pregnant 
workers 
across our country. 
While many pregnant individuals continue 
working throughout their pregnancies with-
out incident, there are instances when minor 
accommodations are necessary at the work-
place to ensure the safety of the expecting 
mother and the baby. All too often, requests 
for simple workplace accommodations like a 
stool to sit, a water bottle, or a bathroom 
break are denied. Within the COVID–19 con-
text, such critical accommodations might 
include 
proper 
protective 
equipment, 
telework, or staggered work schedules that 
offer employees commute times which avoid 
crowded public transportation and increased 
exposure. Currently, pregnant workers may 
continue to work without necessary accom-
modations because they fear losing their jobs 
and need the income, thus endangering their 
health or the health of their pregnancy. 
Without these protections, it is not uncom-
mon for pregnant workers to be let go or 
forced out onto unpaid leave for requesting 
accommodations. Many others must quit 
their job to avoid risking the health of their 
pregnancy. 
Passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act is a moral and economic imperative; 
two-thirds of women who had their first 
child between 2006 and 2008 worked during 
pregnancy, and 88 percent of these first-time 
mothers worked into their last trimester. 
Keeping these women healthy and in the 
workforce is paramount to family economic 
security. Nearly 25 million mothers with 
children under 18 are in the workforce, mak-
ing up nearly 1 in 6 of all workers. And about 
3 in 4 mothers in the workforce are working 
full time. Millions of families rely on their 
earnings. In 2017, 41 percent of mothers were 
the sole or primary breadwinners in their 
families, while 23.2 percent of mothers were 
co-breadwinners. Whole families suffer when 
pregnant workers are forced out of a job. 
The undersigned religious and faith-based 
groups are united in support of the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. We strongly urge you 
to vote for the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act, and to vote against any motion to re-
commit that may be offered.

of

Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I sub-
mit for the RECORD a letter of support 
for this legislation from the March of 
Dimes. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
March of Dimes, one of the leading non-prof-
it organization fighting for the health of all 
moms and babies and promotes the health of 
women, children and families across the life 
course, we enthusiastically support the Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). Mod-
eled after the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, the bill would require employers to pro-
vide reasonable, temporary workplace ac-
commodations to pregnant workers as long 
as the accommodation does not impose an 
undue hardship on the employer. This bill is 
critically important because no one should 
have to choose between having a healthy 
pregnancy and a paycheck. 
Three-quarters of women will be pregnant 
and employed at some point in their lives. 
Most pregnant workers can expect a normal 
pregnancy 
and 
healthy 
birth. 
However, 
healthcare providers have consistently rec-
ommended that some pregnant women make 
adjustments in their work activities to sus-
tain a healthy pregnancy and prevent ad-
verse 
pregnancy 
outcomes, 
including 
preterm birth or miscarriage. Workplace ac-
commodations are medically necessary and 
can include allowing additional bathroom 
breaks, opportunities to stay hydrated, lift-
ing restrictions, or access to a chair or stool 
to decrease time spent standing. 
Unfortunately, too many pregnant work-
ers, particularly pregnant women of color, 
face barriers to incorporating even these 
small changes to their workdays. Workplace 
accommodations help safeguard a healthy 
pregnancy or prevent harm to a higher-risk 
pregnancy. Across the country, pregnant 
workers continue to be denied simple, no- 
cost or low-cost, temporary adjustments in 
their work settings or activities and instead 
risk being fired or forced to take unpaid 
leave to preserve the health of their preg-
nancy. Low-wage pregnant workers in phys-
ically demanding jobs, which are dispropor-
tionately occupied by people of color, feel 
the impact most acutely. This impossible 
choice forces many pregnant workers to con-
tinue 
working 
without 
accommodations, 
putting both mother and baby at risk of 
longlasting and severe health consequences. 
One of the main predictors of a healthy 
pregnancy is early and consistent prenatal 
care. Getting early and regular prenatal care 
can help ensure a healthy, full-term preg-
nancy. The costs of a healthy birth tend to 
be around $5,000, whereas the costs associ-
ated with a premature or complicated birth 
range closer to $76,000. Prenatal checkups 
are crucial and necessary, so that providers 
can answer any questions, check on the over-
all health of mom and baby, and spot com-
plications early when there is a greater 
chance to prevent them. If there is a possi-
bility of a loss of employment, it would im-
pact family resources and threaten the abil-
ity 
to 
afford 
vital 
prenatal 
care 
and 
healthcare costs when most needed. 
Pregnancy affects every system of the 
body, so pregnant workers may need work-
place accommodations to mitigate complica-
tions before they arise. During the second 
and third trimester, additional stress re-
quires that the lungs work harder to provide 
oxygen as the heart supplies blood through-
out the body and for the fetus. Some preg-
nant people have chronic health diseases, 
such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, 
and need to take extra precautions to man-
age the condition. Moreover, additional 
stress during pregnancy may be caused by 
physical discomfort and other changes in 
daily life. Some of this stress may cause seri-
ous health problems, like high blood pres-
sure, which could lead to problems like 
preeclampsia and premature birth, condi-
tions that impact Black women at far higher 
rates than white women and contribute to 
this country’s Black maternal health crisis. 
Therefore, it is imperative that pregnant 
workers are protected and provided the nec-
essary and reasonable accommodations, to 
ensure that they are able to continue work-
ing and maintain healthy pregnancies. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a 
measured approach to a serious problem. 
March of Dimes understands the importance 
of reasonable workplace accommodations to 
ensure that women can continue to provide 
for their families and have safe and healthy 
pregnancies. We urge swift passage of the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
Sincerely, 
ARIEL GONZA´ LEZ, ESQ., 
MA, 
Senior Vice President, 
Public Policy & Gov-
ernment 
Affairs, 
March of Dimes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act. 
In my district and across the coun-
try, pregnancy discrimination persists, 
especially against people of color and 
immigrant women. 
When companies refuse to accommo-
date for pregnancy-related needs, it 
doesn’t just hurt the person being dis-
criminated against, it hurts the entire 
family, especially when nearly half of 
working women are the sole or primary 
provider for their families. 
It is time to put families first over 
corporate greed. We must ensure that 
no pregnant person is forced to quit, 
coerced into taking unpaid leave, or 
fired because their employer refuses to 
accommodate them. 
We must protect the more than 85 
percent of women who will become 
mothers at some point in their working 
lives. 
On behalf of all the beautiful mothers 
in my district, #13DistrictStrong, I 
thank Chairman NADLER and Chairman 
SCOTT for their leadership, and I urge 
support for this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act. 
I thank Chairman NADLER for intro-
ducing this vital bill, and I also thank 
Chairman SCOTT for his incredible lead-
ership and his work in getting it to the 
floor. 
Ending discrimination against preg-
nant workers is a critical component in 
closing the economic divide between 
men and women in our country. 
Before coming to Congress, I ran 
Colorado’s Consumer Protection Agen-
cy, which included our State civil 
rights division, and I saw up close in 
the complaints that we adjudicated the 
unfortunate reality is that women are 
often denied even the simplest of work-
place accommodations because they 
are pregnant, and too often women are 
forced out or not considered for hire 
due to their pregnancy. This must end. 
And we have an incredible opportunity 
to do precisely that by getting this bill 
across the finish line today. 
I am a proud supporter of the Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act, and I 
would encourage every Member of this 
body to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this critical leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I submit for the 
RECORD a letter from the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, a 1.4 mil-
lion-member organization highlighting 
their support for this critical legisla-
tion. 
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 
OF TEAMSTERS, 
September 11, 2020. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.4 
million members of the International Broth-
erhood of Teamsters, I urge you to support 
H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act when it comes to the floor in the next 
week. The Teamsters Union is proud to sup-
port this important legislation which would 
promote healthy pregnancies and economic 
security for pregnant women. 
In the last few decades, there has been a 
demographic shift in the workplace. Women 
now make up almost half of the workforce. 
There are more pregnant workers than ever 
before and they are working later into their 
pregnancies. Yet, too often, instead of pro-
viding a pregnant worker with an accommo-
dation, her employer will fire her or push her 
onto unpaid leave, depriving her of a pay-
check and health insurance at a time when 
she needs them most. 
While pregnancy discrimination affects 
women across race, ethnicity and economic 
status, women of color and low-wage workers 
are disproportionately impacted. Women of 
color are more likely to hold certain inflexi-
ble and physically demanding jobs that can 
present specific challenges for pregnant 
workers, making reasonable accommoda-
tions on the job even more important. 
In 2018, the New York Times ran a front 
page article detailing the tragic loss experi-
enced by a number of women working at a 
Verizon 
fulfillment 
center/warehouse 
in 
Memphis, TN, operated by XPO Logistics 
and previously operated by New Breed Logis-
tics. New Breed and XPO should be quite fa-
miliar at this point, as they have garnered 
considerable press attention in recent weeks. 
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy was CEO of 
New Breed and served on the XPO Board dur-
ing the time at which these tragedies took 
place. 
The women who worked at the Memphis 
warehouse generally spent twelve hour shifts 
moving boxes full of Verizon cell phones and 
other devices. Upon becoming pregnant, all 
had asked for reasonable accommodations, 
including light duty. Three of the women 
said that they even brought in doctors’ notes 
recommending less-taxing workloads and

shorter shifts, but supervisors disregarded 
the letters. 
Certainly, some of these women considered 
leaving their jobs with New Breed/XPO, or 
taking unpaid leave to protect theirs and 
their unborn child’s health, but at an aver-
age hourly wage of $11/hr, unpaid leave and 
elective terms of unemployment are entirely 
unrealistic. 
In response to the New York Times article 
and additional coverage by the Los Angeles 
Times and the PBS Newshour, nearly 100 
members of Congress submitted a letter to 
the House Committee on Education and 
Labor urging investigation into the dis-
turbing treatment of workers at the Mem-
phis facility. With pressure mounting, XPO 
solicited the counsel of an outside expert to 
draft an internal policy to address the needs 
of pregnant workers. This was a step in the 
right direction, but it should not take con-
gressional action and national press cov-
erage to compel an employer to do the right 
thing. Make no mistake, this new XPO pol-
icy only exists because of the workers in 
Memphis who stood up and spoke out. 
Unfortunately, XPO’s new policy has zero 
chance of helping women at the Memphis fa-
cility. Two months after announcing the pol-
icy, XPO Logistics abruptly announced that 
it would shut down the warehouse where all 
of the women featured in the New York 
Times article had worked. This action cre-
ates a chilling effect on other workers who 
might choose to access reasonable accom-
modations at XPO. What pregnant worker is 
going to feel comfortable asking for reason-
able accommodation when the end result of 
speaking up might be job loss? Key among 
its many protections is that H.R. 2694 would 
prohibit retaliation against pregnant work-
ers who request accommodation. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will 
provide a clear, predictable rule: employers 
must provide reasonable accommodations for 
limitations arising out of pregnancy, child-
birth, or related medical conditions, unless 
this would pose an undue hardship. No 
woman should have to choose between pro-
viding for her family and maintaining a 
healthy pregnancy. The Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act would ensure that all women 
working for covered employers would be pro-
tected. 
The Teamsters Union is proud to stand 
with XPO workers and all pregnant workers 
demanding change. I urge you to stand up to 
unscrupulous employers like XPO and swift-
ly enact H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. HOFFA, 
General President. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
It is a great disappointment to me 
that I will be voting against this legis-
lation before us today. My Republican 
colleagues and I have long been com-
mitted to policies and laws that em-
power all Americans to achieve suc-
cess, and this includes protections in 
Federal law for pregnant workers. We 
agree that discrimination of any type 
should not be tolerated, and no one 
should ever be denied an opportunity 
because of unlawful discrimination. I 
will repeat that, Madam Speaker. We 
agree that discrimination of any type 
should not be tolerated, and no one 
should ever be denied an opportunity 
because of unlawful discrimination. 
After meaningful and necessary bi-
partisan improvements were made to 
H.R. 2694 during the committee mark-
up, it is unfortunate today’s legislation 
falls short in protecting one of our Na-
tion’s most treasured rights, freedom 
of religion, the first right mentioned in 
the Bill of Rights. 
Democrats’ refusal to include a com-
monsense provision that protects reli-
gious organizations from being forced 
to make employment decisions that 
conflict with their faith is short-sight-
ed, disappointing, and easy to fix. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SCOTT

Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of

Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter in support of the legis-
lation from the National WIC Associa-
tion, that is Women, Infants, and Chil-
dren Association, in favor of the legis-
lation, and another letter from the 
ACLU, the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
NATIONAL WIC ASSOCIATION LETTER IN SUP-
PORT
OF
H.R. 2694, PREGNANT
WORKERS 
FAIRNESS ACT 
On behalf of the National WIC Association, 
the 12,000 WIC state and local service pro-
vider agencies we represent, and the over six 
million mothers, babies, and young children 
our members serve, we enthusiastically sup-
port passage of the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act (H.R. 2694). The accommodations es-
tablished by this bill are urgently needed to 
assure healthy pregnancies for working 
mothers served by WIC. 
WIC providers serve approximately half of 
all babies born in the United States with nu-
trition support and counseling throughout 
pregnancy, the postpartum period, and early 
childhood. WIC’s nutrition intervention has 
successfully supported positive birth out-
comes by reducing preterm birth and other 
complications that can lead to lifelong 
health conditions and significant healthcare 
costs. Nutrition—including adequate hydra-
tion—is vital for the health of a pregnancy, 
but additional protections are needed to ad-
dress the factors that influence pregnancy 
and birth outcomes beyond nutrition. 
This bill wisely extends the workplace ac-
commodations framework—first developed in 
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)— 
to ensure that employers are taking reason-
able steps to minimize risks to employees’ 
pregnancies. Simple modifications to the 
workplace such as a stool to sit on, relief 
from heavy lifting, or a water bottle to carry 
can contribute to the health of the preg-
nancy without taking drastic action that in-
hibits the pregnant worker’s economic secu-
rity, such as unpaid leave or termination. 
This balanced and effective approach, al-
ready familiar to employers from the ADA 
context, will work in tandem with other 
medical and nutrition precautions to ensure 
positive birth outcomes and healthy infants. 
Women now constitute the majority of the 
American 
workforce. 
Three-quarters 
of 
working women are expected to be both preg-
nant and employed during their adult lives. 
Without a clear legal standard, pregnant 
workers may be forced to choose between 
keeping a roof over their head, putting food 
on the table, and the health of their preg-
nancy. This burden is even more acute for 
the approximately twenty percent of work-
ing woment—a total of 15.2 million women— 
who live in households that earn less than 
185 percent of the federal poverty line, which 
is the income threshold for WIC participa-
tion. Of these 15.2 million women, 59 percent 
(approximately nine million) are working 
part-time. 
No pregnant worker should have to choose 
between the health of their pregnancy and 
their livelihood. As direct-service providers 
that support almost two million pregnant 
and postpartum women, the WIC community 
strongly supports efforts that advance sen-
sible policy to safeguard the health of preg-
nancies. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
is a thoughtful solution that will com-
plement WIC’s tireless efforts to support ex-
pectant mothers as they seek a healthy start 
for their babies. We urge swift passage of 
this critical legislation. 
Sincerely, 
REV. DOUGLAS GREENAWAY, 
President & CEO, 
National WIC Association. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
Re Vote YES for the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act (H.R. 2694). 
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
the American Civil Liberties Union, and our 
more than 8 million members, supporters, 
and activists, we write to express our sup-
port for H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act. This critical legislation would 
combat an all-too-common form of preg-
nancy discrimination while also providing 
employers much-needed clarity on their obli-
gations under the law. We urge all members 
of the House of Representatives to vote in 
favor of this measured, bipartisan, and long- 
overdue legislation and to oppose the motion 
to recommit. 
The ACLU has long fought to advance 
women’s equality and opportunity by chal-
lenging laws and policies that discriminate 
against women in the workplace and by dis-
mantling the stereotypes that constrain 
women’s full engagement and participation 
at work. Although the Pregnancy Discrimi-
nation Act has played a critical role over the 
past 40 years in securing women’s place in 
the workforce, too many women continue to 
be marginalized at work because of their de-
cision to become pregnant and have children. 
This kind of discriminatory treatment has 
become most obvious when pregnant work-
ers—predominantly women in physically de-
manding or male-dominated jobs, low-wage 
workers, and women of color—request tem-
porary accommodations to address a medical 
need and instead are terminated or placed on 
unpaid leave, causing devastating economic 
harm. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
would address this problem by requiring em-
ployers with fifteen or more employees to 
provide reasonable and temporary accom-
modations to pregnant workers if doing so 
would not impose an undue hardship on the 
business. 
PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION, THE PDA, AND 
YOUNG V. UPS, INC. 
Pregnancy and childbirth are often locus 
points for discrimination against women in 
the workforce. Policies excluding or forcing 
the discharge of pregnant women from the 
workplace were common in the 1970s and re-
flected the stereotype that a woman’s pri-
mary or sole duties were to be a homemaker 
and raise children. The adoption of the Preg-
nancy Discrimination Act (PDA) in 1978, an 
amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, established that discrimination 
because of ‘‘pregnancy, childbirth, and re-
lated medical conditions’’ was a form of dis-
crimination ‘‘because of sex.’’ It was in-
tended to dismantle the stereotype, and the 
policies based on it, that viewed pregnant 
women’s labor force participation as contin-
gent, temporary, and dispensable without re-
gard to their individual capacity to do the 
job in question.

The PDA also required employers to treat 
pregnant workers the same as other tempo-
rarily disabled workers because Congress 
recognized that working women contributed 
to their families’ economic stability and 
should not have to choose between a career 
and continuing a pregnancy. Despite the 
PDA, pregnancy discrimination persists, and 
for many years courts routinely ruled 
against workers who brought pregnancy ac-
commodation cases where they alleged dis-
crimination when an employer provided a 
job modification to an employee temporarily 
unable to work but failed to do the same for 
a pregnant worker. 
In Young v United Parcel Service, Inc., the 
Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve 
a split in the Circuits and for the first time 
addressed the PDA’s application in the con-
text of an employee who needed an accom-
modation due to pregnancy. The Court con-
cluded that the statute’s mandate applied 
with equal force in these circumstances and 
articulated a modified analysis for failure- 
to-accommodate cases. The Court also of-
fered a new pretext analysis that plaintiffs 
may rely on when litigating claims under 
the PDA’s second clause. Since Young, the 
reflexive approval of employer policies favor-
ing workers with occupational injuries has 
largely disappeared. However, the bright-line 
deference to employer policies, and the 
overbroad reading of such policies as ‘‘preg-
nancy-blind,’’ has been replaced, in many in-
stances, with an unduly demanding standard 
for plaintiffs in making a showing of dif-
ferential treatment—even at the initial 
pleading stage, prior to having the benefit of 
discovery. This trend undermines Young’s 
intent of demanding that employers justify 
failures to accommodate pregnancy. Instead, 
they impose unwarranted—and often insur-
mountable—burdens of proof on pregnant 
workers that increasingly confer ‘‘least fa-
vored nation’’ status on the protected trait 
of pregnancy. The stories of clients the 
ACLU has represented—both as direct coun-
sel and as lead amicus—illustrate the harm: 
Lochren 
v. 
Suffolk 
County: 
Sandra 
Lochren and five other police officers sued 
the 
Suffolk 
County 
Police 
Department 
(SCPD) for refusing to temporarily reassign 
pregnant officers to deskwork and other non- 
patrol jobs, even though it did so for officers 
injured on the job. But for those officers who 
opted to keep working patrol, 
SCPD also failed to provide bulletproof 
vests or gun belts that would fit pregnant of-
ficers. Their only safe option was to go on 
unpaid long before their due dates. 
Cole v. SavaSeniorCare: When Jaimie Cole, 
a certified nursing assistant, was in her third 
trimester, she developed a high risk of 
preeclampsia, a condition that can lead to 
preterm labor or even death. Her doctor ad-
vised her not to do any heavy lifting. Cole’s 
job required her to regularly help patients in 
and out of bed and assist with bathing, so she 
asked for a temporary light duty assign-
ment. Instead, her employer sent her home 
without pay for the rest of her pregnancy. 
Myers v. Hope Healthcare Center: Asia 
Myers, a certified nursing assistant, experi-
enced complications early in her pregnancy 
and was told by her doctor that she could 
continue to work, but should not do any lift-
ing on the job. Although her employer had a 
history of providing light duty to workers 
with temporary lifting restrictions, Myers 
was told not to return to work until her re-
strictions were lifted. She was out of work 
for over a month with no income or health 
insurance coverage. 
Hicks v. City of Tuscaloosa: Stephanie 
Hicks, a narcotics investigator with the Tus-
caloosa Police Department in Alabama, 
wanted to breastfeed her new baby, but her 
bulletproof vest was restrictive, painful, and 
prone to causing infection in her breasts. 
She asked for a desk job but her employer re-
fused, even though it routinely granted desk 
jobs to officers unable to fulfill all of their 
patrol duties. Instead, it offered her an ill- 
fitting vest that put her at risk. 
Legg v. Ulster County: Corrections Officer 
Ann Marie Legg was denied light duty during 
her pregnancy, even though Ulster County 
gave such assignments to guards injured on 
the job. In her third trimester, Legg had to 
intervene in a fight, prompting her to go on 
leave rather than face future risks. 
Allen v. AT&T Mobility: Cynthia Allen 
lost her job because she accumulated too 
many ‘‘points’’ under AT&T Mobility’s puni-
tive attendance policy due to pregnancy-re-
lated symptoms such as nausea. The policy 
makes accommodation for late arrivals, 
early departures, and absences due to thir-
teen enumerated reasons, some medical and 
some not, but none due to pregnancy and 
pregnancy-related symptoms. 
Durham v. Rural/Metro Corp.: Michelle 
Durham was an EMT in Alabama whose job 
often required her to lift patients on stretch-
ers into an ambulance. When she became 
pregnant, her health care provider imposed a 
restriction on heavy lifting. Durham asked 
Rural/Metro for a temporary modified duty 
assignment during her pregnancy, but was 
rejected, despite the company’s policy of giv-
ing such assignments to others. She was told 
her only option was to take unpaid leave. 
It is indisputable that Young was an im-
portant step forward to combat pregnancy 
discrimination. Yet, too many pregnant 
workers continue to face insurmountable ob-
stacles in HR offices, where employers mis-
understand their obligations under the PDA, 
and in courtrooms across the country, where 
judges use Young to hinder access to needed 
accommodations. Despite the clear mandates 
of the PDA, the current legal landscape 
leaves exposed and unprotected those preg-
nant workers who want to continue working 
while maintaining a healthy pregnancy. 
Similarly, many pregnant workers have 
not found protection or recourse under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 be-
cause absent complications, pregnancy is not 
considered a disability that substantially 
limits a major life activity. This legal re-
ality means that many of the symptoms of a 
normal pregnancy that can disrupt a work-
er’s ability to do her job such as extreme fa-
tigue, morning sickness, or limitations on 
her mobility are not entitled to accommoda-
tion. Moreover, many pregnant workers seek 
accommodation precisely because they wish 
to avoid the conditions that might disable 
them or endanger their pregnancy. Yet be-
cause the ADA is so expansive with respect 
to other conditions that qualify as disabil-
ities, the population of non-pregnant work-
ers entitled to reasonable accommodation is 
exponentially larger than when the PDA was 
enacted more than 40 years ago. Accordingly, 
without such express entitlement to accom-
modation, pregnant workers face an unten-
able ‘‘least favored nation’’ status in the 
workplace. 
The simple solution to this no-win situa-
tion is the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
This legislation, modeled after the ADA and 
using a framework familiar to most employ-
ers, takes a thoughtful and measured ap-
proach to balancing the needs of working 
people and employers by requiring businesses 
with fifteen or more employees to provide 
workers with temporary, reasonable accom-
modation for known limitations related to 
pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical 
conditions if doing so would not place an 
undue hardship on business. It also prohibits 
employers from forcing a pregnant employee 
to take a leave of absence if a reasonable ac-
commodation can be provided; prevents em-
ployers from denying job opportunities to an 
applicant or employee because of the individ-
ual’s need for a reasonable accommodation; 
prevents an employer from forcing an appli-
cant or employee to accept a specific accom-
modation; and prohibits retaliation against 
individuals who seek to use PWFA to protect 
their rights. 
At a time when women constitute nearly 60 
percent of the workforce and contribute sig-
nificantly to their families’ economic well- 
being, passage of PWFA is a dire necessity. 
When a pregnant worker is forced to quit, co-
erced into taking unpaid leave, or fired be-
cause her employer refuses to provide a tem-
porary job modification, the economic im-
pact can be severe; if she is the sole or pri-
mary breadwinner for her children, as nearly 
half of working women are, her entire family 
will be without an income when they most 
need it. She further may be denied unem-
ployment benefits because she is considered 
to have left her job voluntarily. She may 
have few if any additional resources on 
which to rely. PWFA ensures that women 
would 
not 
face 
such 
devastating 
con-
sequences. Instead, it treats pregnancy for 
what it is—a normal condition of employ-
ment. 
PWFA promotes women’s health. Accom-
modations make a ’difference in physically 
demanding jobs (requiring long hours, stand-
ing, lifting heavy objects, etc.) where the 
risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight 
are significant. The failure to provide ac-
commodations can be linked to miscarriages 
and premature babies who suffer from a vari-
ety of ailments. This bill would be an impor-
tant contribution in the fight to improve 
maternal health and mortality. 
There is also a strong business case for 
PWFA. Providing pregnant employees with 
reasonable accommodations increases work-
er productivity, retention, and morale, and 
reduces health care costs associated with 
pregnancy complications. PWFA can also re-
duce litigation costs by providing greater 
clarity regarding an employer’s legal obliga-
tions to pregnant workers. In fact, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce stated that PWFA 
would establish ‘‘clear guidelines and a bal-
anced process that works for employers and 
employees alike.’’ Additionally, a group of 
leading private sector employers expressed 
their support for PWFA and noted ‘‘women’s 
labor force participation is critical to the 
strength of our companies, the growth of our 
economy and the financial security of most 
modern families.’’ 
Finally, 30 states across the political and 
ideological spectrum have recognized the 
benefits of providing reasonable accommoda-
tions to pregnant workers. Congress should 
ensure that all pregnant workers, not just 
some, have the protections they need. 
It is time for Congress to act and pass the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

accommodations to continue working 
safely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4523 
September 17, 2020 
As my colleagues have pointed out, 
most accommodations, which can in-
clude water, seating, and more fre-
quent restroom breaks, are not com-
plex or costly. Yet without these sim-
ple accommodations, health risks to 
pregnant workers can be significant 
and potentially tragic. 
The COVID–19 pandemic poses in-
creased risks for pregnant workers at a 
time when pregnant women comprise 
62 percent of frontline workers, includ-
ing more than 75 percent of healthcare 
workers. 
Passing the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act today, we can take a strong 
bipartisan step to guarantee that all 
pregnant workers have access to basic 
workplace protections. 
Madam Speaker, once again, I urge 
my colleagues to support the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, today we 
act so that women will no longer experience 
the fear of not knowing if they can maintain 
their family’s financial security while they are 
pregnant. 
As the number of women who work as the 
primary breadwinners in their households con-
tinues to rise, this financial insecurity rises as 
well. 
While growing up, my mother was forced 
out of the Navy because she was pregnant. 
Although times have changed, mothers are 
still being forced out of their employment due 
to the absence of reasonable accommoda-
tions. I know first-hand the pressures of being 
that single source of income for my house-
hold, and I have seen how Black and Latina 
workers are overrepresented in low-wage, 
physically demanding jobs that need preg-
nancy accommodations for them to stay safe. 
More than a decade ago, the Americans 
with Disabilities Act was amended to better 
implement the principle that physical or mental 
disabilities should be met with reasonable ac-
commodations. 
Pregnancy is not considered a disability 
under the ADA, however, enabling employers 
to deny reasonable accommodations like al-
lowing pregnant employees to sit on a stool 
rather than stand during a long shift. 
This bill would correct that, and I would like 
to include in the RECORD a letter from the 
Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities ad-
dressed to Chairman SCOTT
and Ranking 
Member FOXX in support of the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. 
New Mexico is one of thirty states that have 
enacted laws to protect access to reasonable 
accommodations for pregnant workers so they 
have safe working conditions and, if they are 
denied that, the right to receive lost pay and 
compensatory damages. 
Millions of pregnant workers in these states 
have benefited from these protections, but a 
pregnant employee’s ability to work safely 
should not depend on where in this country 
she lives. 
The Pregnant Workers’ Fairness Act, which 
is endorsed by nearly 200 worker advocates, 
civil rights groups and the business commu-
nity, will hold every employer in our country, 
across state lines, to these same standards. 
As we hear horrific stories of immigrant 
women forced to have hysterectomies and 
lose their ability to have children, we are re-
minded that the health, safety and wellbeing of 
all women is not something we can turn a 
blind eye to, whether those women work in 
boardrooms, on a factory floor, or in a hos-
pital. 
I support this legislation because no expect-
ant mother should have to risk her health or 
that of her unborn child to stay financially sta-
ble. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this his-
toric bill. 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2020. 
Re Support for Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act, H.R. 2694. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Education and 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: As co-chairs of the Consortium for 
Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights Task 
Force, we write in strong support of the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 2694. 
CCD is the largest coalition of national orga-
nizations working together to advocate for 
federal public policy that ensures the self-de-
termination, independence, empowerment, 
integration and inclusion of children and 
adults with disabilities in all aspects of soci-
ety. 
The 
Americans 
with 
Disabilities 
Act 
(ADA)’s mandate that covered employers 
make reasonable accommodations to ensure 
equal opportunity for applicants and employ-
ees with disabilities has been tremendously 
important in helping people with disabilities 
secure and maintain employment. While the 
ADA does not cover pregnancy itself as a dis-
ability, in light of the ADA Amendments 
Act, which lowered the standard for dem-
onstrating a disability from what the courts 
had previously applied, many pregnant work-
ers who experience pregnancy-related com-
plications should be covered as people with 
disabilities and entitled to reasonable ac-
commodations under the ADA. Yet many 
courts have continued to interpret the 
ADA’s coverage narrowly, and in practice, 
large numbers of pregnant workers are not 
offered reasonable accommodations. Fur-
thermore, a clear pregnancy accommodation 
standard will help prevent pregnancy-related 
complications before they arise. Such ac-
commodations should be provided to preg-
nant workers so that they can remain in the 
workforce and not lose their employment 
simply because they experience pregnancy- 
related limitations. 
The accommodation requirement of H.R. 
2694 is limited, as is the ADA’s accommoda-
tion requirement, to those accommodations 
that are reasonable and would not impose an 
undue hardship. That standard takes into ac-
count the needs of employers while also en-
suring that pregnant workers can stay on 
the job with reasonable accommodations. 
This protection is critical not only for preg-
nant workers but for our national economy. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is par-
ticularly important to people with disabil-
ities. Many people with disabilities who did 
not require accommodations before becom-
ing pregnant experience new complications 
due to how pregnancy impacts their disabil-
ities, and need accommodations once they 
become pregnant. These workers are some-
times told that they are not entitled to ac-
commodations because the employer views 
the need for accommodation as related to 
pregnancy rather than to the worker’s un-
derlying disability. 
We thank the Committee for moving the 
bill forward and urge all members of the 
House of Representatives to vote for the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and oppose 
any motion to recommit.

Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. This meaningful legislation will protect 
pregnant workers who have suffered because 
of insufficient workplace protections, a story 
far too familiar to many workers who call 
Memphis home. 
Two years ago, I was shocked to read of 
the disturbing workplace abuses in an XPO 
warehouse in Memphis. Warehouse workers 
were denied minor and reasonable accom-
modations like less taxing workloads and 
shortened work shifts. As a result, several 
women suffered miscarriages, some of which 
happened while they were still on the ware-
house floor. 
I, along with Congresswoman DELAURO and 
ninety-five of my colleagues, wrote to the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee to urge the 115th 
Congress to take decisive action and consider 
the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
The 116th Congress has rightly given this 
bill the attention it deserves, and this bill will 
give pregnant workers the protections that are 
past-due. No employee should be forced to 
choose between their job and their health. I 
appreciated the opportunity to participate in 
the Education and Labor Committee’s Sub-
committee hearing on this bill, and I am 
pleased to support the Pregnant Workers Fair-
ness Act’s consideration today. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary, Homeland Se-
curity, and Budget Committees, the Demo-
cratic Working Women Task Force, and as co-
sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2694, 
the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), 
which would ensure that pregnant workers can 
continue to do their jobs and support their 
families by requiring employers to make work-
place adjustments for those workers who need 
them due to pregnancy, childbirth, and related 
medical conditions, like breastfeeding. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would 
establish that private sector employers with 
more than 15 employees and public sector 
employers must make reasonable accom-
modations for pregnant employees, job appli-
cants, and individuals with known limitations 
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
medical conditions. 
Similar to the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, employers are not required to make an 
accommodation if it imposes an undue hard-
ship on an employer’s business. 
Pregnant 
workers 
and 
individuals 
with 
known limitations related to pregnancy, child-
birth, or related medical conditions cannot be 
denied employment opportunities, retaliated 
against for requesting a reasonable accommo-
dation, or forced take paid or unpaid leave if

another reasonable accommodation is avail-
able. 
Workers denied a reasonable accommoda-
tion under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
will have the same rights and remedies as 
those established under Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, including recovery of lost 
pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable 
attorneys’ fees. 
While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act 
(PDA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA) provide some protections for pregnant 
workers, there is currently no federal law that 
explicitly and affirmatively guarantees all preg-
nant workers the right to a reasonable accom-
modation so they can continue working with-
out jeopardizing their pregnancy. 
The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in 
Young v. United Parcel Service, 575 U.S. 
ll, No. 12–1226, 135 S.Ct. 1338 (2015) al-
lowed pregnant workers to bring reasonable 
accommodation discrimination claims under 
the PDA. 
But pregnant workers are still being denied 
accommodations because the Young decision 
set an unreasonably high standard for proving 
discrimination, requiring workers to prove that 
their employers accommodated non-pregnant 
workers with similar limitations. 
As a result, in two-thirds of cases after 
Young, courts ruled against pregnant workers 
who were seeking accommodations under the 
PDA. 
Providing accommodations ensures that 
women can work safely while pregnant instead 
of getting pushed out of work at a time when 
they may need their income the most. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is espe-
cially important considering that many preg-
nant workers hold physically demanding or 
hazardous jobs, and thus may be especially 
likely to need reasonable accommodations at 
some point during their pregnancy. 
Madam Speaker, research shows that preg-
nant workers are likely to hold jobs that in-
volve standing and making continuous move-
ments, which can raise specific challenges 
during pregnancy. 
Such physically demanding work—including 
jobs that require prolonged standing, long 
work hours, irregular work schedules, heavy 
lifting, or high physical activity—carries an in-
creased risk of pre-term delivery and low birth 
weight. 
Twenty-one (20.9) percent of pregnant 
workers are employed in low-wage jobs, which 
are particularly likely to be physically demand-
ing. 
Pregnant black and Latina women are dis-
proportionately represented in low-wage jobs, 
which means as a result, these workers are 
especially likely to stand, walk or run continu-
ously during work, and therefore may be more 
likely to need an accommodation at some 
point during pregnancy to continue to work 
safely. 
Three in ten pregnant workers are employed 
in four of the occupations that make up the 
backbone of our communities: elementary 
school teachers, nurses and home health 
aides. 
Employers 
can 
accommodate 
pregnant 
workers because pregnant women make up a 
small share of the workforce, even in the oc-
cupations where they are most likely to work, 
which means that only a very small share of 
an employer’s workforce is likely to require 
pregnancy accommodations in any given year 
since less than two percent of all workers in 
the U.S. are pregnant each year. 
Not all pregnant workers require any form of 
accommodation at work, so only a fraction of 
that small fraction will need accommodations. 
For example, pregnant women are most 
likely to work as elementary and middle school 
teachers but only three percent (3.2 percent) 
of all elementary and middle school teachers 
are pregnant women. 
But workers employed in four of the ten 
most common occupations for pregnant work-
ers—retail salesperson; waiter or waitress; 
nursing, psychiatric and home health aide; and 
cashier—who report continuously standing on 
the job would particularly benefit from this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, prolonged standing at 
work has been shown to more than triple the 
odds of pregnant women taking leave during 
pregnancy or becoming unemployed. 
Another four of the ten most common occu-
pations for pregnant workers—waiter or wait-
ress; nursing, psychiatric and home health 
aide; cashier; and secretaries and administra-
tive assistants—involve making repetitive mo-
tions continuously on the job which have been 
shown to increase the likelihood of pregnant 
women taking sick leave. 
Pregnant workers in low-wage jobs are par-
ticularly in need of this legislation granting 
them the clear legal right to receive accom-
modations because, in addition to the phys-
ically demanding nature of their jobs, they 
often face inflexible workplace cultures that 
make it difficult to informally address preg-
nancy-related needs. 
For instance, workplace flexibility—such as 
the ability to alter start and end times or take 
time off for a doctor’s appointment—is ex-
tremely limited for workers in low-wage jobs. 
Over 40 percent of full-time workers in low- 
wage jobs report that their employers do not 
permit them to decide when to take breaks; 
between two-thirds and three-quarters of full- 
time workers in low-wage jobs report that they 
are unable to choose their start and quit times; 
and roughly half report having very little or no 
control over the scheduling of hours more 
generally. 
The second most common occupation for 
pregnant Latinas—maids and housekeeping 
cleaners—is especially physically demanding 
because, according to the data, 80 percent of 
maids and housekeeping cleaners stood con-
tinuously, 38 percent were exposed to disease 
daily, and 70 percent walked or ran continu-
ously on the job. 
Occupations that have seen the most 
growth among pregnant women in the past 
decade expose many workers to disease or 
infection daily; depending on the disease, this 
can pose particular challenges to some preg-
nant workers at some points during preg-
nancy. 
When pregnant workers are exposed to 
some diseases, they face particular risks; 
pregnant women with rubella are at risk for 
miscarriage or stillbirth and their developing 
fetuses are at risk for severe birth defects. 
Madam Speaker, no one should have to 
choose between a paycheck and a healthy 
pregnancy, which is why they should have 
clear rights to reasonable accommodations on 
the job to ensure they are not forced off the 
job at the moment they can least afford it. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2694, the Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act, a critical effort that 
I have cosponsored. Despite almost four dec-
ades since the passage of the Pregnancy Dis-
crimination Act, women continue to face sig-
nificant challenges in the workplace during 
their pregnancies. 
This is especially concerning for those work-
ing jobs that require physical activity, for which 
temporary modifications to limit risks to ex-
pectant mothers should be considered. In-
stead, employers have often refused to ac-
commodate pregnant workers, forcing them to 
choose between their health or economic se-
curity. 
This 
is 
unacceptable—employers 
should not be permitted to discriminate against 
pregnant individuals who are requesting rea-
sonable workplace accommodations. 
Therefore, I am pleased to support the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which will re-
quire that employers make these reasonable 
accommodations for pregnant workers. This 
legislation will also benefit those who are em-
ployed and expecting, but it is especially crit-
ical for the more than 1 in 5 pregnant workers 
who are employed in a low-paid job with phys-
ically demanding work and minimal flexibility. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will make 
possible for accommodations that include the 
modification of no-food-or-drink policy to pre-
vent contractions from lack of hydration, reas-
signment of heavy lifting duties, and provision 
of additional personal protective equipment, 
staggered workplace schedules, or telework 
during COVID–19. 
As representatives of Americans from all 
corners of our country, we have a responsi-
bility to protect the health and economic liveli-
hood of our expectant mothers and the well- 
being of their families. On behalf of my home 
state of Texas, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, for 
far too long, pregnant workers in our country 
have lacked reasonable accommodations at 
their workplaces. They need to keep their jobs 
to ensure economic security for themselves 
and their families. Yet, without reasonable ac-
commodations they could risk their health and 
safety. I am proud to cosponsor the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act, which would right this 
wrong. This bill would require employers to 
make reasonable accommodations for preg-
nant workers who need them. Without this leg-
islation, some may continue to work in unsafe 
conditions. Currently, pregnant workers might 
be let go or forced into unpaid leave, just for 
asking for reasonable accommodations. Some 
may quit their job to avoid risking the health of 
their pregnancy. This is unacceptable. Preg-
nant workers deserve better. They deserve 
these commonsense protections. That is why 
I am proud to cosponsor and vote for this bill 
today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1107, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill.

Speaker, I am in its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Foxx of North Carolina moves to re-
commit the bill (H.R. 2694) to the Committee 
on Education and Labor with instructions to 
report the bill back to the House forthwith 
with the following amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NONDISCRIMINATION WITH REGARD TO 
REASONABLE 
ACCOMMODATIONS 
RELATED TO PREGNANCY. 
It shall be an unlawful employment prac-
tice for a covered entity to— 
(1) not make reasonable accommodations 
to the known limitations related to the preg-
nancy, childbirth, or related medical condi-
tions of a qualified employee, unless such 
covered entity can demonstrate that the ac-
commodation would impose an undue hard-
ship on the operation of the business of such 
covered entity; 
(2) require a qualified employee affected by 
pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical 
conditions to accept an accommodation 
other than any reasonable accommodation 
arrived at through the interactive process 
referred to in section 5(7); 
(3) deny employment opportunities to a 
qualified employee if such denial is based on 
the need of the covered entity to make rea-
sonable accommodations to the known limi-
tations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, 
or related medical conditions of a qualified 
employee; 
(4) require a qualified employee to take 
leave, whether paid or unpaid, if another rea-
sonable accommodation can be provided to 
the known limitations related to the preg-
nancy, childbirth, or related medical condi-
tions of a qualified employee; or 
(5) take adverse action in terms, condi-
tions, or privileges of employment against a 
qualified employee on account of the em-
ployee requesting or using a reasonable ac-
commodation to the known limitations re-
lated to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
medical conditions of the employee.

or related medical conditions who has in-
formed the covered entity that accommoda-

affected. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina (during 
the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to dispense with 
the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of her motion. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, this motion is the final oppor-
tunity to amend this legislation and 
would do so without any delay in pas-
sage. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans support 
protections in Federal law for pregnant 
workers, and we believe employers 
should provide reasonable accommoda-
tions for pregnant workers. 
I support the provisions in H.R. 2694, 
which were previously outlined during 
the general debate. I also recognize 
that improvements to the bill were the 
result of bipartisan negotiations, and I 
commend Chairman SCOTT for his out-
reach in this regard. 
Unfortunately, despite our agree-
ment on these changes, there remains 
an important outstanding issue that 
must be resolved. The bill before us 
today does not include a narrow but 
longstanding provision from the Civil 
Rights Act that protects religious or-
ganizations from being forced to make 
employment decisions that conflict 
with their faith. The motion to recom-
mit adds this important protection. 
This very limited provision is already 
in current law, and it allows religious 
organizations 
to 
make 
religiously 
based employment decisions. 
Without 
this 
longstanding 
Civil 
Rights Act provision, H.R. 2694 will 
create confusion and legal risk for reli-
gious organizations in their religiously 
based employment decisions. 
At least 16 States and the District of 
Columbia in their pregnancy discrimi-
nation or pregnancy accommodation 
laws also include a provision similar to 
the Civil Rights Act religious organiza-
tion protection. 
In fact, a Democrat-invited witness 
at a committee hearing highlighted 
Kentucky’s recently enacted pregnancy 
accommodation law as a template for 
Congress to follow. Kentucky’s law in-
cludes a religious organization protec-
tion very similar to the one found in 
the Civil Rights Act. 
At the Rules Committee hearing on 
H.R. 2694 earlier this week, the bill’s 
sponsor, Chairman NADLER, said it is 
not necessary to incorporate into H.R. 
2694 the Civil Rights Act provision that 
protects religious organizations. He 
stated that because H.R. 2694 does not 
repeal this provision, it will still be ef-
fective if the bill becomes law. 
At 
the 
same 
hearing, 
Chairman 
SCOTT said the religious organization 
protection should not be included in 
H.R. 2694 because it is overinclusive 
and would provide too much protec-
tion. 
I strongly disagree with both of these 
perspectives, and I am not sure Chair-
man NADLER’s explanation is in line 
with Chairman SCOTT’s position. 
Without the current law protection, 
H.R. 2694 will create legal jeopardy for 
religious organizations, as I have pre-
viously stated. But for the sake of ar-
gument, let’s assume the provision is 
superfluous. 
Madam Speaker, what would the 
harm be in including the Civil Rights 
Act protection in H.R. 2694? At worst, 
the provision would be duplicative with 
the Civil Rights Act, causing no harm 
to workers or employers. At best, it 
will prevent a religious organization 
from being required to violate its faith. 
By adding this simple reference to 
H.R. 2694 from the Civil Rights Act, we 
can ensure the protections in the bill 
are harmonized with the protections 
for religious organizations found in the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act, PDA, 
and the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, ADA. 
I would also briefly like to address 
recent claims made by the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce—a trade association 
which represents few, if any, religious 
employers—that, under this bill, re-
quired 
workplace 
accommodations 
would not come into conflict with a re-
ligious organization’s beliefs. 
The 
chamber 
acknowledges 
that 
leave, including paid leave, can be part 
of a reasonable accommodation under

September 17, 2020 
the ADA, from which H.R. 2694 incor-
porates the definition of reasonable ac-
commodation. Therefore, if a religious 
organization has a paid leave policy, 
H.R. 2694 could require the organiza-
tion to allow paid leave for purposes 
that conflict with its religious tenets. 
The chamber also contends that H.R. 
2694 is not a bill that addresses hiring, 
unlike the PDA and the ADA, which 
apply to hiring. This is false. H.R. 2694 
applies to both employees and job ap-
plicants, so it is indeed a hiring stat-
ute. 
Therefore, the religious organization 
protections in the Civil Rights Act and 
the ADA are just as relevant to H.R. 
2694 as they are to those statutes. 
Madam Speaker, to conclude, the 
motion to recommit includes H.R. 2694 
in its entirety, with one important ad-
dition related to religious organization 
protections. My amendment simply in-
corporates the title VII religious orga-
nization protection to ensure these or-
ganizations are not forced to violate 
their faith in making employment and 
accommodation decisions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this simple but im-
portant addition to the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, first, let me just restate what 
I said about the Congressional Re-
search Service that found that States 
typically do not enact separate or spe-
cialized religious exemptions for preg-
nancy accommodation laws. 
Madam Speaker, this MTR would 
jeopardize women’s health and risk 
their pregnancies in order to provide a 
religious exemption for employers, to 
exempt them from the requirement to 
provide just basic and reasonable ac-
commodations for the workforce. Ex-
actly who would want them to deny 
these basic accommodations? 
First, it is unnecessary. The Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act already ex-
empts small private employers, includ-
ing religious employers, with fewer 
than 15 employees. According to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 80 percent 
of religious organizations have fewer 
than 10 employees. 
Second, the underlying bill does not 
in any way amend or change the under-
lying exemptions in title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act or Americans with 
Disabilities Act or any other bill. It 
doesn’t affect the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act. But it would, if it is 
specified in this bill, give the employer 
the idea that they could deny reason-
able accommodations if they for some 
religious reason don’t agree with the 
pregnancy: women who are pregnant 
and divorced, women pregnant out of 
wedlock, pregnant in a same-sex rela-
tionship. 
What, you don’t have to give them a 
water break? 
This amendment is unnecessary. The 
other exemptions are there for legiti-
mate 
religious 
reasons, 
and 
this 
overbroad amendment would just cause 
mischief. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this political 
poison pill of an MTR. 
Corporations are a legal creation. 
They don’t have religious beliefs. Their 
officers might, but they do not. 
Let’s be clear about who inspired the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
It is women who have asked for ac-
commodations in lifting requirements 
because their doctors told them they 
were at high risk of miscarriage or 
preterm birth. 
It is women like the worker in Penn-
sylvania who was denied a schedule 
change and fired due to cramping in 
her uterus that landed her in the ER. 
This MTR invites discrimination. It 
emboldens those who would use reli-
gion as a basis to discriminate against 
people who are pregnant and not mar-
ried, workers in same-sex couples, 
women who used IVF to get pregnant, 
even people with partners of a different 
race. 
Something the proponents of this 
amendment aren’t saying out loud is 
that other religious exemptions would 
already apply to the Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act. 
This MTR frustrates the purpose of a 
good bill, a bill that is supported by 
the Chamber of Commerce and by 89 
percent of voters. 
Every year, an estimated quarter of a 
million women are denied requests for 
an accommodation because current law 
forces pregnant workers to find other 
nonpregnant employees who received 
similar accommodations to make a 
case. 
When pregnant women are denied ac-
commodations, they face health risks, 
miscarriage, premature births. 
Symptoms and conditions of preg-
nancy cannot be fully appreciated un-
less you have been pregnant yourself. 
So when you consider this vote on the 
MTR, remember that 80 percent of di-
rectors of ACWI Index companies are 
men. Men who have never experienced 
the struggles of pregnancy will be de-
ciding whether to invoke an exemption 
to deny an accommodation to a preg-
nant worker. That is not right. 
This bill is not some new burden on 
employers. They must already engage 
in a good faith interactive process over 
reasonable accommodations under the 
ADA. 
This bill, as written, takes employer 
concerns into account. Employers with 
fewer than 15 employees or those who 
would suffer undue hardship need not 
provide accommodations. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a resounding 
‘‘no’’ vote on this MTR because it di-
lutes the very protections for pregnant 
workers that the bill seeks to estab-
lish. Those protections are long over-
due. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for next 
week. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
to my friend, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the House ma-
jority leader. 
HONORING RETIRING PARLIAMENTARIAN THOMAS 
J. WICKHAM, JR. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Before we begin the colloquy, let me 
make some remarks about someone 
who has made a real difference in this 
House. 
Madam Speaker, every society that 
wants to be a successful society has to 
have rules. Thomas Jefferson, one of 
the great political thinkers of the cen-
turies, observed that there had to be 
both comity and fairness if we were 
going to come together and have a de-
mocracy that was operational. 
Dick Gephardt used to say that the 
legislative process was a substitute for 
armed confrontation, that the resolu-
tion of differences in a democracy 
needed to be done in a civil way, pursu-
ant to rules. 
Madam Speaker, we are losing, in a 
short period of time, a gentleman who 
has made a difference for this House, 
this Congress—House and Senate—has 
made a difference to the civility of this 
House, a gentleman who, by the way, is 
not responsible in any way for the lack 
of civility that, from time to time, 
breaks out in this House. 
b 1430 
I refer, Madam Speaker, to our Par-
liamentarian, Tom Wickham. I have 
had the privilege of knowing him all of 
his days in the House of Representa-
tives. He has been here for a significant 
period of time and has served as our 
Parliamentarian for essentially four 
Congresses, 8 years. 
He stands—or sits, at this point in 
time—a short, at least 6 feet, distance, 
with his mask on, which is a unique ex-
perience for him, from the Speaker’s 
rostrum. He is there to ensure that we 
play by the rules. He is there to ensure 
us that we do not take advantage of 
one another, but that we resolve, in 
pursuit of the rules, the differences 
that we may have and do so in a way 
that, for centuries, essentially, have 
governed how we process in the legisla-
tive arena. 
It is a nonpartisan role. Obviously, 
he served when there were Republican 
Speakers, and obviously, he is serving 
now with a Democratic Speaker. It is 
nonpartisan, 
but 
it 
is 
sometimes 
thankless, particularly when you have 
to make a ruling, particularly that the 
majority party does not like. 
I must say that there is probably not 
a Member among us who hasn’t at 
some point in time said either, ‘‘Gee, I 
am sorry Wickham made that ruling,’’ 
or, ‘‘I don’t agree with Wickham.’’ 
Therefore, it is a tough job because we 
are all pretty powerful people. We all 
think we are pretty smart people, and 
we know this, that, and the other. So, 
you have to have the courage of your 
convictions as well as the intellectual 
reasoning to go behind your decision. 
Tom Wickham has had that every day 
he has served in this House. 
It is hard to be a referee because the 
calls don’t always go the way people 
want. One of the hallmarks of the Par-
liamentarian’s 
Office, 
and 
Tom 
Wickham in particular, is they call 
them as they see them. No matter the 
effect of those rulings, they make the 
ruling that they believe is correct. You 
can disagree, but what you cannot dis-
agree with is that the Parliamentar-
ian’s Office prides itself on calling 
them as they see them. 
Now, it was difficult, I am sure, for 
every Parliamentarian, and the Parlia-
mentarian’s Office, to conduct this 
role. But they have done so in a man-
ner, all the time I have been here, 
which I am in my 40th year, that has 
been a credit to the House of Rep-
resentatives, a credit to our democ-
racy, a credit to Thomas Jefferson’s 
perception of trying to create rules and 
ways of doing things that credited de-
mocracy, that did not undermine it. 
Tom was also the Deputy Parliamen-
tarian and the Assistant Parliamen-
tarian, so he has had a lot of experi-
ence. He has spent a quarter of a cen-
tury working for this House. 
I will miss him. We will miss him. 
This Congress will miss him. 
He will be succeeded by somebody 
who has experience and depth and will, 
I know, in the tradition of all the Par-
liamentarians 
with 
whom 
I 
have 
worked over those 40 years, be fair and 
unflinching in calling it as he sees it. 
We will miss Tom’s good humor and 
kind nature. I know my staff will miss 
working closely with him every day to 
ensure the smooth and proper running 
of the floor. 
On behalf of Democrats, and I know 
Mr. SCALISE will speak on behalf of his 
party as well, I want to thank you, 
Tom, for your service, for your dedica-
tion to this institution, for the tem-
perate way in which you dealt with all 
of us, even when we were not tem-
perate. You were steady, thoughtful, 
fair. 
Also, as I said, I want to congratulate 
Deputy Parliamentarian JASON SMITH, 
who will succeed Tom as Parliamen-
tarian of the House. He will, as every 
Parliamentarian with whom I have 
served, be fair, be honest, and call 
them as he sees them. My staff and I 
look forward to working with him in 
his new role. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. 
Obviously, we will have an oppor-
tunity to continue, as we should, this 
tribute to Tom Wickham. 
So, Tom, congratulations on what 
you have done to preserve the integrity 
of this institution. 
We come here as Republicans, Demo-
crats, as Americans first, but people 
who all have their own views. Even if 
you are Republican, we don’t all think 
exactly the same way, as Democrats 
don’t always think the same way. But 
we come here to achieve certain things, 
to make this a more perfect Union in 
the ways in which our districts—our 
750,000, roughly, people elect us to 
come and be part of this democracy, 
the world’s greatest democracy. 
You come and work with other peo-
ple. Sometimes, you battle with other 
people in the arena of legislative ideas. 
It is not physical confrontation, as the 
majority leader pointed out. But some-
times, you have to persuade. Some-
times, you have to fight for your be-
liefs. 
But ultimately, if you are going to 
achieve the things you came here to 
do, you have to change legislation. It 
takes an act of Congress, as they say. 
When you do that, you have to follow 
the rules. 
The Jefferson Manual that goes back 
to 1801 are the rules that govern this 
great House. If there is a bill on the 
floor and you wish to make a change to 
that bill, you want to offer an amend-
ment to the bill, bring a motion to re-
commit on the bill, you have to work 
within the rules. Those rules are inter-
preted not by the majority, not by the 
minority, but by the Parliamentarian. 
The job you have done for 25 years in 
the Parliamentarian’s Office, but espe-
cially since 2011 as the House Parlia-
mentarian, you don’t always tell peo-
ple what they want to hear, but you 
tell people what is the right way to do 
something according to the rules that 
we have established so that there is a 
fair process. 
A lot of people don’t see this back 
and forth. If the Parliamentarian rules 
against you, it is not a personal thing. 
In many cases, a Member will go to the

Parliamentarian, Republican or Demo-
crat—I have done this myself—and 
said, ‘‘This is what I would like to 
achieve.’’ 
Sometimes, they tell you that you 
can’t do it on that bill because there 
are germaneness issues. But some-
times, there is that gray area where if 
you are trying to do it this way, it 
won’t work, but if you try to do it an-
other way, it actually would work. 
That is really the art of the ability of 
a Parliamentarian, to work with Mem-
bers of Congress to help them achieve 
the things they are trying to do. We 
still have to go and get the votes, but 
at least allowing a Member that oppor-
tunity to go fight it out and make 
their case. 
In many cases, that case wouldn’t be 
able to be made if the Parliamentarian 
wasn’t fair in offering that guidance to 
Members of Congress, whatever they 
are trying to achieve, whatever their 
background, whatever their district, to 
be fair and to at least give them that 
opportunity to come here on the House 
floor and fight that battle, hopefully 
right that wrong, and advance the 
things that they were elected to go do 
to make this a more perfect Union. 
So thank you, Tom, for that fairness. 
I know as Jason takes on this role in 
a few weeks, he will have a great leg-
acy to build upon and to look toward 
somebody who did the job right and 
served this country in a very proud and 
respected way. 
I know Heather is probably watching 
on C–SPAN. I am not sure how many 
other people are, but Heather, hope-
fully, is, your wife. She will have more 
time to work with you. I am not sure 
who the parliamentarian of your house 
is. I am the House Republican whip, 
but in my house, Jennifer is the one 
who plays that role. 
But in your house, hopefully, Heath-
er sees you more, because you are here 
when we are here, and sometimes those 
are late hours, and sometimes those 
are long weekends. 
We appreciate the sacrifices you have 
made. Hopefully, in this next role in 
your life, you will be able to enjoy 
more time with your wife, Heather, and 
your family. 
We truly do thank you for playing 
this part of your role in history and 
adding to what is great about this 
great democracy. 
Do you mind standing up so every-
body in the Chamber here can see you 
and pay the proper tribute? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
If I might wryly observe, Madam 
Speaker, that I have not seen the Par-
liamentarian pass you a note to in-
struct the gentleman to address the 
Chair. 
Tom, I am going to address you. 
Mr. SCALISE. As I was addressing it 
to the Speaker, of course. 
Mr. HOYER. Tom Wickham, for those 
who are watching, is a wonderful exam-
ple of the extraordinary patriotism, 
loyalty, and talent that has contrib-
uted to this House’s operation by all of 
our staff. He is one of the best, but we 
have the best. 
Tom, I know you treated all the 
staff, certainly on my staff—and I 
know all the staff—with great respect 
because you knew how important they 
were. We all know how important you 
have been to the operations of this 
House. 
I don’t know what you will be doing. 
But assuming that you, at this young 
age of yours—I told you that you were 
way too young for us to let you go, but 
you are going—you will be doing other 
things, and you will bring great value 
to whatever enterprise you pursue. 
We have been blessed for a quarter of 
a century with your service, and we 
thank you for that service. Godspeed. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. 
Madam Speaker, we all appreciate 
Tom’s service to our country and espe-
cially to this Chamber. 
Now, if I may inquire of the majority 
leader the schedule for next week, and 
I would yield. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on 
Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. 
for legislative business. No votes are 
expected in the House on Monday. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 
a.m. for morning-hour debate and 11 
a.m. for legislative business. 
I would remind Members that Mon-
day is expected to be a travel day fol-
lowing the holiday. So, Monday we will 
have business on the floor, but we will 
have no votes on the floor. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- 
hour debate and 11 a.m. for legislative 
business. 
On Friday, the House will meet at 9 
a.m. for legislative business. 
We will consider several bills, Madam 
Speaker, under suspension of the rules, 
a large number of suspension bills, in 
fact. The complete list of suspension 
bills will be announced by the close of 
business tomorrow. 
The House will consider, as well, next 
week a continuing resolution for fiscal 
year 2021. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
House 
has 
passed 10 of its appropriations bills of 
the 12 appropriations bills we have. 
Sadly, the Senate has not passed a 
single bill out of committee, has not 
voted on a single appropriations bill in 
its committee. As a result, clearly, we 
will not be able to conclude the appro-
priations process, and we will have to 
have a CR to make sure that govern-
ment stays serving the American peo-
ple. 
Hopefully, we can reach a bipartisan 
agreement, and there will not be a con-
troversial 
continuing 
resolution. 
I 
know Democrats and Republicans and 
the administration are working toward 
that end. 
I expect and hope a bill to be filed to-
morrow. That is our hope. But we do 
expect to consider that bill next week. 
The CR, as I said, is necessary to 
avert a shutdown that would only fur-
ther damage our economy and under-
mine our efforts on COVID–19. 
In addition, the House will consider 
H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and 
Innovation 
Act. 
This 
bill, 
Madam 
Speaker, is a package of legislation re-
ported out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee to 
invest in energy innovation and clean 
energy development. 
In addition, the House may consider 
H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Disclosure Act, and H.R. 6210, the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. 
Members are advised that additional 
legislative items are possible. 
I yield back to my friend, the Repub-
lican whip. 
b 1445 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman and appreciate 
the timeline, especially the comments 
about the negotiations that have been 
going on in a very constructive way re-
garding a continuing resolution. They 
have definitely been in good faith with 
Republicans and Democrats as well as 
with the White House. It is encour-
aging to hear that, potentially, tomor-
row that could be filed and we fully ex-
pect to be ready to take that up next 
week if that does, in fact, happen. 
I know the differences that we have 
been talking about in the last few days 
are minor in consideration of all of the 
factors that are included in a con-
tinuing resolution. So I think, as peo-
ple watch some of the bigger fights 
that are real between the two sides, to 
see that on something as important as 
properly and responsibly funding the 
government that we are making very 
good progress on at least a short-term 
mechanism that would stave off any 
kind of shutdown between now and 
September 30, I appreciate the work 
that has been done by the majority 
with the minority and with the White 
House and Senate to get to that point. 
Hopefully, we do get that legislation 
filed and are able to take it up next 
week. 
Unless the gentleman had anything 
else on that, there was another legisla-
tive issue I wanted to bring up. 
As we both know, there are conversa-
tions going on regarding a potential 
next relief package. We don’t know if 
there will be an agreement reached. 
These negotiations have been going on 
for weeks and weeks since the CARES 
Act, the multiple pieces of legislation 
that we filed both before and after that 
we have come to an agreement on, 
things like the Paycheck Protection 
Program that both sides worked very 
hard on, very successfully on. 
Reports have come out to show over 
50 million Americans’ jobs were saved 
by the work we did as a Congress work-
ing together to save millions of small 
businesses and over 50 million jobs as 
we are struggling through this pan-
demic. 
One of the things I would like to ask 
the gentleman to take a look at is that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4532 
September 17, 2020 
we may get an agreement, but we may 
not on a bigger relief package, and we 
see multiple bills that are out there. 
The Senate has been trying to advance 
something. The House has had a posi-
tion. Some House Democrats yesterday 
filed a separate bill with some other 
House Republicans to try to have a 
third way, and the White House has 
been talking about a different option. 
In the meantime, we clearly don’t have 
an agreement yet on that. 
I would ask if the gentleman would 
look at H.R. 8265. This is a bill by Rep-
resentative CHABOT of Ohio. He is the 
lead Republican on the House Small 
Business Committee. This is a bill that 
would specifically target those small 
businesses that were part of the Pay-
check Protection Program. This is not 
a new idea. This is taking the existing 
framework of a bill that we, both sides, 
came together to pass, a very success-
ful bill. 
As the gentleman knows, the Pay-
check Protection Program still has 
over $130 billion remaining in its ac-
count, money that wasn’t spent. We 
were able to help every business that 
asked. Every business that was eligible 
was able to go to their local bank, 
didn’t have to go to an SBA lender. 
Again, I want to thank our small 
community banks that played such an 
important role. We would not have 
been able to help all those small busi-
nesses stay afloat if our local commu-
nity banks didn’t participate in helping 
the customers that they usually see on 
a daily basis who are struggling. 
But as that money is sitting in that 
account, the program has expired, so 
the money can no longer be spent. We 
have appropriated this money. It is not 
new money and it is not a new pro-
gram. 
But 
what 
Representative 
CHABOT’s bill does is it would allow 
those small businesses that have shown 
a loss—we know there are some busi-
ness doing better today than they were 
before COVID; there are some that are 
doing dramatically worse after COVID. 
This would specifically be limited to 
those businesses that have experienced 
at least a 25 percent loss or more, that 
they would be able to go for a second 
round of Paycheck Protection loans, 
using existing money, not new money, 
the money that is locked in an account 
that can no longer be spent. 
So maybe we do get an agreement be-
tween now and then on a larger pack-
age, but if we don’t, at a minimum, I 
would just ask the gentleman—I would 
think this would be something that 
could pass on the suspension calendar 
to at least help small businesses using 
a program we already agree upon, that 
we already know has been successful. It 
saved small businesses in every single 
district of this country. It is not a Re-
publican or Democrat plan. It has been 
a plan that truly has been a lifeline for 
any of our small businesses. And, 
again, over 50 million jobs have been 
saved. 
I would just ask the gentleman if he 
would take a look at that, if we don’t 
get an agreement, to potentially bring 
something like that to the floor—that 
could be a suspension-type bill to 
pass—and, at least while we are negoti-
ating things that may or may not hap-
pen, help those businesses that we 
know need help. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Of course, the Paycheck Protection 
Program was a very, very important 
program. I was pleased that the com-
mittees came up with that program 
and we had bipartisan support for that 
program. 
I will tell the gentleman that that is 
an important effort for us to take, but 
I would also say it is very important 
for us to act on behalf of millions of 
people who still do not have a job or 
are on unemployment and need the 
supplemental unemployment that they 
were receiving to survive and keep 
their families going. 
We have millions of people who are 
suffering from food shortages, the in-
ability to keep their family fed. We 
need to pass, we believe, the supple-
mental nutrition program. 
We need to make sure that States, in 
my view, have the ability to function. 
They are hemorrhaging revenues be-
cause of COVID–19, because of the de-
crease in the economy. States, cities, 
municipalities, counties are suffering, 
and many other aspects, including test-
ing, which is one of the critical compo-
nents of us confronting COVID–19. 
So while I agree with the gentleman 
that the program that he talks about— 
of course, we created that program and 
we passed it in a bipartisan fashion, 
and it was very bipartisan in the Sen-
ate. I know Mr. CARDIN and Mr. RUBIO 
were both involved in that. It was very 
important to pass that. 
But I will tell the gentleman that I 
was pleased that the President indi-
cated that we need to invest very sig-
nificant sums, which he then said 
would come back to the U.S. or help 
the U.S. economy. I think that was a 
positive step forward. 
I would also observe, as the gen-
tleman observed, that Speaker PELOSI 
and Secretary Mnuchin reached four 
major deals, compromises—four. One 
was, we thought, very big at the time, 
$8.3 billion, which now looks somewhat 
small. But we reached four of those. We 
brought them to the House floor, the 
Senate floor, and they passed over-
whelmingly in bipartisan votes. 
Secretary Mnuchin and the Speaker 
have been discussing trying to get to, 
for 4 months now—now, Mr. MEADOWS 
is also in the room. Mr. MEADOWS and 
I have a very positive relationship, but 
my observation has been, through the 
years, Mr. MEADOWS
is more about 
stopping deals than making deals. 
But I agree with the gentleman, we 
need to act. I am hopeful that the ad-
ministration and the Senate and the 
House will reach agreement ASAP, not 
only on the PPP, which I agree with 
the gentleman on, not only on the 
PPP, but all the other programs that I 
mentioned and many more that are in 
the HEROES bill. 
The Speaker has indicated we are 
certainly prepared to negotiate what 
the expenditure is, and she has indi-
cated a willingness to come down very, 
very substantially to try to reach an 
agreement, which is what compromise 
is all about. That hasn’t happened yet, 
but I am hopeful that it will happen in 
the near term, because I agree with the 
gentleman, we need to act. I am urging 
the administration and all of us to 
come to an agreement. 
Unfortunately, in the Senate, their 
efforts have not been successful in 
passing a bill. So we have no alter-
native bill beyond the HEROES bill 
that passed, as I said, 4 months ago, so 
we have nothing to conference because 
there is no Senate bill. 
In fact, Mr. MCCONNELL went from a 
trillion down to a half a trillion, which 
almost every economist, either at a 
trillion or half a trillion, says is not 
sufficient for health reasons and eco-
nomic reasons and family reasons to 
confront the enormity of the challenge 
that still confronts us as a result of 
COVID–19. 
So I thank the gentleman for men-
tioning Mr. CHABOT’s legislation. He is 
right, of course, there is $130 billion in 
the pot. I think we ought to purpose 
that to either a continuation of PPP or 
a continuation of PPP and other 
things. But I think we ought to do it, 
and what we are trying to do is a com-
prehensive package that deals with all 
the challenges confronting American 
families, particularly the unemploy-
ment insurance. 
As of July 31, as the gentleman 
knows, 
the 
supplemental 
payment 
lapsed. To some degree, the President 
has tried to put additional sums in 
there. Some States are pursuing it and 
some States have effected it. 
But I hope that the bottom line is, in 
the next week, in the near term, and I 
think the President’s statement was 
helpful, and I hope, frankly, the Sen-
ators take that to heart, that we need 
to invest much more than they sug-
gested if we are going to meet the 
scope of the problem that exists. 
I thank the gentleman bringing to 
the House’s attention that particular 
bill, and certainly it will be under con-
sideration as well, I think, by those 
who are negotiating, mainly Secretary 
Mnuchin and Speaker PELOSI. Mr. 
MCCONNELL has chosen not to partici-
pate in those discussions, as you know. 
Mr. SCHUMER does, and I think Mr. 
MCCARTHY does—I am not sure all the 
time, but I am sure he does as well. 
We want to get an agreement. We 
want to do what we have done four 
times: reached an agreement, passed it 
overwhelmingly in both Houses for the 
people, because the people are hurting 
and we need to act and meet that chal-
lenge of their hurt and their need to 
support themselves, their families, and, 
as you point out, their businesses. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4533 
September 17, 2020 
As we look at the various topics that 
the gentleman from Maryland brought 
up on the negotiations, if you looked at 
the Senate bill—and, clearly, there are 
multiple bills out there—ultimately, it 
is going to take a bipartisan bill work-
ing with the administration. Mr. MEAD-
OWS has been here many times work-
ing, trying to meet, sometimes not 
being able to get meetings with some 
leaders. 
But at the same time, if you look at 
the Senate bill, they did include some 
enhanced 
unemployment. 
They 
in-
cluded more money for small busi-
nesses, for families, for testing. They 
had $16 billion for testing, $31 billion 
for vaccine, which I know—I want to 
bring that up. They had $20 billion for 
farmers, $15 billion for childcare. 
They did have liability protection, 
which continues to be a very big issue 
many small businesses bring up. They 
want to make sure that, if they open 
safely, they are not going to be shut 
down by frivolous lawsuits. That is 
something that there has been a lot of 
negotiation about as well. 
But, ultimately, when you look at 
those differences, we will hopefully get 
that resolved. In the meantime, if that 
can’t get broken, at a minimum, if we 
can look at some of the money that is 
unspent because, in addition to the 
PPP, I think the gentleman knows, we 
also put about $150 billion in the 
CARES Act toward our States to help 
all of our States, a formula that al-
lowed States and, in some cases, local 
governments get money to help them-
selves through these tough times. 
There is not one State that has spent 
all that money. And I know some peo-
ple want to talk about how much more 
money to give, but if they haven’t 
spent the money they have already 
gotten, maybe we can look there as an-
other way to help push more relief, in-
cluding with schools. 
If a school wants to reopen safely— 
and I would encourage all schools, the 
protocols have been out there. The 
Centers for Disease Control have put 
out very good, responsible safety proto-
cols for safely reopening schools, and it 
varies, depending on the kind of region 
you are in. If you have a spike, there is 
a way to handle that. If you are in an 
area that has not seen a prevalence of 
COVID, then there is a different way to 
handle it. But in every case, there is a 
way to safely reopen schools. The 
American Academy of Pediatrics has 
laid that out as well. It means fol-
lowing the safety guidelines, but it can 
be done and needs to be done. 
Unfortunately, in every case it is not 
being done, but it is not for lack of 
money. Any school system that needs 
more assistance, whether it is masks or 
screens for the teachers or whatever 
else they might need, sanitizer, the 
funds that we sent to the States, again, 
none of which have spent all of that 
money, can be used to help to safely re-
open schools as well. 
So those are all conversations we will 
hopefully have. 
I do want to then talk about where 
we are with a vaccine, because we have 
been seeing a lot more reports on the 
progress, the tremendous progress that 
has been made within the medical com-
munity. And we know from the very 
beginning of this disease that our 
frontline healthcare workers have been 
some of the heroes, probably the big-
gest heroes of all of this, those hospital 
workers, the nurses, the doctors, but 
also those people working in the labs. 
b 1500 
Almost instantly after China lied to 
us about the origination of the disease, 
lied to us about even whether or not 
the disease could be spread from person 
to person they corrupted the WHO. But 
ultimately as we started to find out 
what was coming out of Wuhan, I don’t 
know, even the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee of this House majority had a 
hearing 
titled: 
‘‘The 
Wuhan 
Coronavirus.’’ So clearly, we know 
where this started. It has been dis-
cussed. 
But at the same time, we have been 
working feverishly to find a cure, to 
find a vaccine. We have seen therapies 
emerge at a rapid pace. President 
Trump implemented Operation Warp 
Speed, which was a way to get red tape 
out of the way. Nobody is cutting cor-
ners on safety, but ultimately what we 
are all doing is focusing all the energy 
and the weight of this Federal Govern-
ment behind finding a cure and a vac-
cine, and what we are seeing now is re-
markable success in progress. 
Here are some of the companies that 
right now are in phase 3 of testing on 
an actual vaccine for COVID–19. These 
are all very respected companies, not 
only in America, but worldwide, glob-
ally respected. 
I am concerned by some of the com-
ments we are starting to see by some 
people trying to undermine the public’s 
confidence in a vaccine if it were to be 
approved by the FDA. And let’s keep in 
mind, the FDA would have to approve 
any vaccine. You have to get approved 
by the FDA to go to phase 2. You have 
to get approved to go to phase 3, and 
then ultimately after testing on tens of 
thousands of people at a pace we have 
never seen before—with money, by the 
way, that we helped pass, and again, 
the gentleman and I both were part of 
those coalitions, Republican and Demo-
crat, working to put money in place for 
that testing, for the work that is being 
done by these great companies to start 
now making the vaccine vials, a hun-
dred million vials possibly that could 
be made before the drug is approved if, 
in fact, it then gets that approval, so 
that you don’t have to wait to start 
mass producing after the approval. 
If the FDA does approve any or all of 
these drugs as a vaccine that would ac-
tually prevent COVID–19, I hope we 
would both encourage people, if they 
wanted to, to then go and get that vac-
cine. And this is, hopefully, not going 
to be a debate within the country. 
Hopefully, it is going to be a recogni-
tion that America has the best sci-
entific minds in the world. We have the 
most respected drug companies in the 
world, and they are working feverishly, 
not cutting a single corner on safety. 
These would have to be safe and ef-
fective drugs for the FDA to approve 
them, but if any one or all of them get 
approved, then I would hope we would 
encourage people to go and protect 
their families, if that is what they 
want to do. And I know a lot of people 
that would want to do it. I have heard 
from some people, as I am sure the gen-
tleman has, that they may want to 
wait a little while. But I also know 
that people want to be safe and secure 
in their homes. They want to have a 
confidence level that they are not 
going to be at risk of dying from 
COVID. And ultimately a vaccine and a 
therapy are the final answer that gets 
us over the hump, that gets us to where 
we can fully start reopening. 
We are seeing many States at ad-
vanced levels of opening their econ-
omy, but we also know that we are not 
where we need to be, and a vaccine is 
probably going to be that biggest de-
termining point that helps people re-
open in a much more effective way. I 
hope we can at least agree that if that 
approval comes by the FDA that it is 
something we can all embrace and en-
courage people to pursue, if that is 
what they feel is best for their family. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the 
whip 
mentioned 
undermining 
con-
fidence. I will tell the whip with all due 
respect; nobody has undermined con-
fidence in the healthcare system more 
than the President of the United 
States. No one has diverted more at-
tention from the experts; no one has 
denigrated the experts, which under-
mines confidence in their advice and 
counsel, than the President of the 
United States. And no one in the 
health 
community 
said 
that 
the 
coronavirus was a hoax. 
We have just seen that Mr. Woodward 
heard in late January that the Presi-
dent thought this was a very serious 
matter. And then, frankly, he conveyed 
to the American people, don’t worry 
about it, it is going to go away. In a 
few days, a few weeks, it is going to go 
away. 
No one has undermined the con-
fidence of the American people in the 
CDC or the FDA or the NIH more than 
the President of the United States. He 
said they are wrong. 
And I say that because confidence 
needs to be built by leadership. And if 
the vaccine can come out next month, 
hooray, if it can be done consistent 
with what the medical experts and the 
pharmaceutical experts tell us can give 
the American people confidence. 
But I will tell my friend Mr. Caputo 
substantially undermined confidence 
because he wanted to tell the experts 
what to say apparently consistent with 
what the administration’s policy was 
as opposed to what the scientific evi-
dence was.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4534 
September 17, 2020 
And so when you mention confidence, 
some people were trying to undermine 
confidence; we have had six, seven, 
eight months of undermining con-
fidence. 
And it is a shame. Because the gen-
tleman is absolutely right. People are 
going to need confidence. And they are 
going to have to take the vaccine be-
cause that is the only way this econ-
omy is going to get back to where it 
needs to be. People having confidence 
in the safety for themselves, their hus-
band, their wife, their children to be 
about the business of America and 
their own personal business. 
So I would hope that the President 
would leave it to the experts, not to his 
judgment, to the experts as to when a 
vaccine is ready to deliver to the pub-
lic. And then I think all of us ought to 
have that confidence to—I certainly 
am going to get the vaccine when the 
medical experts tell me this is safe to 
take, and I am going to urge my family 
to do the same. And I am sure you have 
just indicated you would do the same. 
I think we will, hopefully, do that. 
But the instilling of confidence, I 
would tell my friend, starts at the top 
and with all of us, as well, because peo-
ple respect us in some respects some-
times, and they think we have knowl-
edge that they may not have, and 
therefore, they want to have con-
fidence that, yes, this is good; no, it is 
not, don’t do it. 
So I would simply say to my friend, 
I hope that we get a vaccine. I hope we 
get it as soon as possible. And I hope 
that the election has nothing to do 
with the vaccine. I hope the decision 
has everything to do with science and 
medicine. And I think all Americans 
hope that, as well. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
would tell the gentleman it is not hope 
that you have to have. This is all about 
science. 
Name one of these companies that 
would put their name on a drug that 
would be injected into American people 
based on politics or based on a timeline 
that would have an impact on an elec-
tion? Not one of these companies would 
do it. I would challenge anyone to 
name a company that would do that, 
because they wouldn’t do that. So it is 
not a hope. 
If the FDA approves one of these 
drugs or all of these drugs, it is because 
they work, they save lives. And we 
can’t have an undermined confidence 
that they would save lives—because a 
vaccine is not something that a Presi-
dent or a candidate for President sits 
in a lab and figures out. It is a very se-
rious process that the FDA, who is the 
most respected agency in the world for 
drug approval, has to sign off on every 
step of the way. 
There are three phases. These are the 
companies that made it all the way 
through. There are other companies 
that are in earlier stages and may ac-
tually get to an FDA-approved vaccine, 
as well, and they are all very well re-
spected, too, but these are the only 
companies. There is no mystery com-
pany. These are the companies that are 
in competition, not with themselves, 
but they are trying to save lives. And 
from everything we are hearing, the re-
sults are tremendously successful. We 
should be applauding that. 
Operation Warp Speed has gotten us 
to this point, and while the President 
might not get credit—and I think it is 
an important point, as the gentleman 
talks 
about 
instilling 
confidence, 
where the President is on science. I 
have been in many of those meetings 
with Dr. Fauci, with Dr. Birx, with the 
whole team of the whole coronavirus 
task force. 
Mr. HOYER. How about Dr. Redfield? 
Mr. SCALISE. He has been in some of 
those meetings, too. And as the gen-
tleman knows, not all doctors agree. 
Mr. HOYER. Did you see what hap-
pened in the last 48 hours? 
Mr. SCALISE. There are some doc-
tors who will say this is the way to do 
it, and there are some doctors who say 
that is the way to do it. You get 10 at-
torneys in a room; you might get 10 
opinions. The saying ‘‘go get a second 
opinion,’’ that is because maybe not all 
doctors agree. 
But when you are President of the 
United States you don’t have the lux-
ury of waiting for every doctor to be in 
agreement. If there is an inflection 
point on a decision, and some doctors 
are over here, and some doctors are 
over there, guess what, it is the Presi-
dent who has to make that final call, 
not because he has ignored science, but 
because he has looked to the science, 
and ultimately, he has to make that 
decision. 
Dr. Fauci himself was in a committee 
hearing by the Select Subcommittee 
that the majority whip, Mr. CLYBURN, 
chairs. I am the lead Republican on 
that committee. We had Dr. Fauci in 
our committee. I asked him specifi-
cally, I went down the line on major 
decisions that had to be made by this 
President and whether or not science 
was used or not and whether or not it 
worked. I started, by the way, with the 
decision of whether or not to stop 
flights from China when we found out 
after China lied that they, in fact, did 
have this disease spreading widely in 
China, and President Trump made that 
decision to stop flights from China. 
I know the Democrat nominee for 
President was against that decision, 
but President Trump worked with the 
experts. Dr. Fauci was part of that. 
I asked him, I said, Was that the 
right decision by President Trump? 
He said, Yes, it was. 
I said, Did that decision save Amer-
ican lives? 
He said, Yes, it I did. 
And we went down the line on deci-
sion after decision, and they were all 
science-based. At no point was the 
President trying to undermine science. 
In fact, some people were trying to 
suggest that Dr. Fauci was being side-
lined, and yet, he was at the hearing, 
under oath, speaking on behalf of his 
role in the administration, and he said 
he has never been sidelined. He was ac-
tually asked that question, Have you 
been sidelined? He said, ‘‘no’’ under 
oath. 
Now, is he always in agreement with 
the other doctors in the room? No, he 
is not. Does that mean he is wrong? No. 
But maybe he is. But, again, doctors 
can disagree because that is what 
science is. It is not two plus two equals 
four every time because you are deal-
ing with some very complicated issues 
of a disease we knew nothing about less 
than a year ago. 
Fortunately, with Operation Warp 
Speed, President Trump put together 
the best scientists, not just in Amer-
ica, but I would argue in the world, to 
figure out how to solve this, how to 
come 
up 
with 
things 
like 
hydroxychloroquine, which some peo-
ple might say doesn’t work. I have 
talked to many doctors who use it suc-
cessfully to save lives even today. That 
should be the doctor’s decision. Some 
people want government to control all 
those decisions. I would rather the doc-
tor being the one to work with his pa-
tient. 
You look at the other drugs that are 
out there today, but again, now we talk 
about a vaccine, there is not one com-
pany on this list—these are the only 
companies right now in phase 3. And if 
any of them are approved by the FDA, 
I hope nobody would question the in-
tegrity of that drug. 
Do you think any of these companies 
would put their name on a drug that 
they don’t stand behind as a safe and 
effective vaccine for this disease? And 
that is really the point. 
It is all about science here. It is all 
about science and some people are try-
ing to undermine that. And we need to 
get away from that because that will 
cost lives. If somebody is reluctant to 
take one of these drugs because they 
heard somebody that said, well, don’t 
trust it if it comes from this President 
or that candidate, that is a dangerous 
game because lives would be lost if peo-
ple didn’t take that vaccine because 
they didn’t have that confidence. We 
all need to have that confidence. We all 
work with science. 
We have all had doctors who told us 
one thing, and maybe you wanted to go 
get that second opinion, but at the end 
of the day, you have got to make that 
choice, and you make it based on all 
the science that is available, and not 
all the time do all the scientists agree. 
In fact, many times on the complicated 
issues you get different opinions from 
different scientists. This President has 
worked with some of the best in the 
world. 
And according to Dr. Fauci himself, 
by and large, the President has fol-
lowed even Dr. Fauci’s advice and has 
made the right decisions up and down 
the line based on science. And most im-
portantly, President Trump’s decision 
following the science has saved Amer-
ican lives, starting with that very first 
decision, which Joe Biden himself was

against. How many American lives 
would have been lost if we didn’t ban 
the flights from China; if we didn’t ban 
the flights from Europe, when it was 
breaking out in Europe; if we didn’t do 
15 days to stop the spread, which Presi-
dent Trump did on the advice of his sci-
entist? After that they said we need to 
go another 30 days. President Trump 
did that, too. Every one of those deci-
sions was based on science. Every one 
of those decisions saved American 
lives. 
b 1515 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
This President doesn’t take responsi-
bility for anything other than good 
things. If anything bad happens, this 
President does not take responsibility. 
He points to somebody else. 
What I interrupted the gentleman on 
was he says, ‘‘the scientists.’’ Redfield 
is a scientist. He is a medical doctor. 
He is the head of the CDC. He made a 
comment, his best judgment as to when 
vaccines were going to be available, 
widely available. 
The President contradicted him on 
both points he made just a few days 
ago, as he has done with Fauci, as he 
has done with Hahn, as he has done 
with others. 
My confidence in those three compa-
nies is that they will come to the ref-
eree and will say: ‘‘Is this ready to 
go?’’ The referee, in this case the FDA, 
that the gentleman says is so respected 
has that responsibility. 
What I don’t have confidence in, 
what I think so many of the American 
people don’t have confidence in, is they 
will get a call from the White House 
that says: ‘‘This is the judgment you 
are going to make.’’ 
We have seen, over and over and over 
again, decisions modified because of 
White House direction. In fact, Caputo 
was there for exactly that reason at 
HHS, not CDC, but overseeing CDC. 
I tell my friend, Madam Speaker, yes, 
we need to have confidence, but we 
need to be truthful with them. We need 
to tell them the truth. We need to take 
direction from the experts, not sub-
stitute our judgment. 
The 
gentleman 
talks 
about 
hydroxychloroquine. Obviously, Fauci 
didn’t think that was a great rec-
ommendation to make. That was for 
doctors to make, but the President 
made it. In fact, most of the doctors 
thought that was not a good rec-
ommendation. 
Certainly, Clorox was even less than 
that, I say as an aside. Maybe it was 
tongue in cheek, but unfortunately, 
when the President speaks, people 
don’t necessarily think it is tongue in 
cheek, and it becomes dangerous. 
I will say to my friend, hopefully, 
that this vaccine issue will be resolved 
by the experts and give confidence to 
the American people that they can, in 
fact, rely on the experts and their doc-
tor to take the vaccine because, hope-
fully, it will be in a position where, in 
fact, it will give the confidence and the 
result that is promised. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
would just remind the gentleman, with 
all due respect to Dr. Redfield, he is 
not the head of the FDA. 
The FDA is the agency that approves 
drugs, and in fact, the FDA is the agen-
cy working every day with these com-
panies. There is a very strict protocol 
for going through phases of testing. 
Now, one thing that is important to 
point out on the testing, because, 
again, some people wonder because Op-
eration Warp Speed has gotten us to a 
point quicker, maybe in the history of 
the world, at finding a vaccine for a 
disease we knew nothing about 8 
months ago, but the reason they are 
doing it is not because they are cutting 
corners. No one in science that I have 
heard has suggested that they are cut-
ting corners because they are not. 
They have strict protocols. 
What they are doing, number one, 
the President put real money in place 
behind making sure that each of these 
drug companies has direct communica-
tion with the FDA every step of the 
way so they know if tests need to be 
run on more people or different demo-
graphic groups, as is done with other 
drugs, they can do it quickly. They 
have a wide range of people willing to 
be tested. 
To the tribute of all Americans, over 
300,000 Americans have signed up for 
these tests. This isn’t being tested on 
just a few people. Sometimes, a drug 
takes years and years to get to market 
for a lot of reasons. One is red tape. 
President Trump has done a great job 
of getting the red tape out of the way 
to let the scientists actually do their 
job in real time. Something could sit 
on somebody’s desk for months, in 
many cases, delaying lifesaving drugs. 
We have gotten that red tape out of the 
way. 
Frankly, we ought to look at work-
ing together as Republicans and Demo-
crats at making that the norm, not the 
exception, to actually be able to get 
red tape out of the way to help save 
lives. 
But as they are doing it, they are 
testing it on more people than is nor-
mally the case. Sometimes, you might 
only have a few thousand people who 
are willing or in a position to be tested. 
Today, you have hundreds of thousands 
of people who are being tested. 
If they make it through each step, it 
is not based on who is in the White 
House. It is based on what the doctors 
at the FDA, working with the smart 
people in these drug companies, have 
come up with based on the test results. 
If they test people and there are prob-
lems, it doesn’t even make it to phase 
2. 
These are all in phase 3. They are all 
showing tremendous promise, but if 
one of them makes it through or if all 
of them make it through, it is not be-
cause somebody rushed it. It is because 
the doctors and the scientists said it 
works. Not one of these companies 
would put their name on that vaccine, 
not one of them. 
Again, I would challenge anybody, 
Madam Speaker, if they think any of 
these companies would cut a corner, 
please let us know right now because 
that is not the case. That narrative 
shouldn’t be out there because that 
narrative would be a false narrative 
and would cost American lives. If that 
narrative were to get out, then there 
might be people who wouldn’t take the 
vaccine 
who 
otherwise 
would 
and 
should, where it could save their life, 
because this will save American lives. 
And it is through American inge-
nuity. We ought to be proud of this. 
We should put the politics aside and 
say thank God America is the leader in 
healthcare to the point where we have 
great American companies partnering, 
in this case, with a German company 
here in America, testing at a level we 
have never seen before on more people 
because we took the priority, through 
Operation Warp Speed, to put all the 
focus of these great agencies on finding 
a cure for COVID–19. 
We are on the brink of doing it. It 
may not happen if the science doesn’t 
match. But if the science does say 
these work, we all ought to applaud 
that and encourage people to explore, 
in a conversation with their doctor, 
whether or not they should take it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I am 
not going to prolong this. The only 
thing I would say is, under the gentle-
man’s theory, Madam Speaker, we 
wouldn’t need the FDA because, clear-
ly, these companies would not do any-
thing just because of profit. And I don’t 
allege that they would do that. 
But we have an FDA because we need 
a referee to look at it without thinking 
of the consequences of a yes or no an-
swer but a scientific answer. That is 
the only observation I would make. 
I get it. I get that the companies are 
reputable companies. 
I support them. They do great work. 
But we have an FDA because we need 
somebody who is an independent arbi-
ter, not just because no company would 
do this. Because if no company would 
do it, we wouldn’t need the FDA. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
never suggested that. In fact, I said at 
the outset that these companies are in 
direct communication with the FDA on 
a regular basis. That is what Operation 
Warp Speed is. 
In the old way of doing things, these 
companies would have submitted their 
data and would have waited months 
while some faceless bureaucrat let it 
sit on a desk and nothing happened. 
Instead, what the President did was 
said there will be direct contacts where 
they can communicate with the FDA. 
They are not the enemy. 
These companies aren’t the enemy. 
The FDA is not the enemy. But it 
shouldn’t be viewed as you are on one 
side and you are on the other side. 
They are both working together be-
cause they are both part of the smart-
est scientific community in the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4536 
September 17, 2020 
They work together because the FDA 
wants to get it right and these compa-
nies want to get it right. 
We saw one of them just a few days 
ago. They had a pause, which is the 
protocol. That is the safety protocol 
because there was a question in the 
testing, and they addressed it. I am 
sure there were many. I don’t know di-
rectly, but I am sure there were many 
conversations with the FDA. 
But then they started up again, 
which means there wasn’t a problem. 
But it meant they followed the proto-
cols, which say, if you see something 
that you need to go review, you hold 
off, and then you go check that out. 
That is what one of these did, and now 
they are back on track. 
The others continue to go through, 
all of them, working with the FDA. 
That is really what this is about. It is 
about a partnership because the FDA 
has to sign off. 
I am sure the gentleman would agree. 
You want to make sure you have mul-
tiple people looking at it. You don’t 
just want the company that is making 
the drug looking at it. You want the 
regulator looking at it as well because, 
ultimately, they have to sign off on it. 
They are not doing it blindly. No one 
suggests that. But they are doing it 
with a much sharper focus. It is the top 
priority, I think we would all agree. 
This needs to be the priority to get our 
country back on track, and it has to be 
done right. But it is not going to get 
signed off if it is not right. So, it is a 
partnership, and it is working incred-
ibly well. 
Again, this new partnership ought to 
be the model in the future. It shouldn’t 
be 
the 
exception 
just 
because 
of 
COVID. It is working incredibly well. 
We worked together to pass the 21st 
Century Cures Act, which ultimately 
will find a cure for cancer, for Alz-
heimer’s, for ALS, for other diseases. It 
is because we put a sharper focus over 
at the National Institutes of Health, 
and we put additional resources over at 
the National Institutes of Health. 
That priority, what we are learning 
from this, ought to be replicated to 
help find a cure for some of those other 
diseases so that maybe we can find 
even more cures for people who are liv-
ing today, not just for somebody 30 
years from now, but for somebody 
struggling today with one of those ter-
rible diseases. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
nothing left to say. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
know we will continue this conversa-
tion. Hopefully, the bill gets filed to-
morrow, and we can resolve more of 
these issues next week. I look forward 
to seeing the gentleman and working 
with him on all of these. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
HONORING COMMISSIONER BILLIE 
DEAN 
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Com-
missioner Billie Dean from the city of 
Apopka. 
Mr. Dean was a guiding light for 
Apopka. 
From bravery in Korea, to the class-
rooms and commission, to the forefront 
of racial integration in the South, 
Commissioner Dean was a champion 
for his community. 
He was a local hero for his work to 
revitalize South Apopka and to fight 
for justice. As a teacher and a commis-
sioner, he made the future of Apopka 
his ultimate cause. 
There is no higher praise for a public 
servant than the love of his commu-
nity. Apopka loved him, and he loved 
Apopka. 
Madam Speaker, we are grateful for a 
life well lived.

AMERICANS ARE WAITING 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, why were we brought back to 
Washington, D.C., this week? 
Was it to provide much-needed relief 
and assistance to American families 
and small businesses because of the 
pandemic? No. 
Instead, we continue to spend time 
on another set of mostly partisan mes-
saging bills with little or no input from 
Republicans. 
My 
Democratic 
col-
leagues rely on grandstanding and talk 
more about the bills they have passed 
than the bills, Madam Speaker, they 
have actually gotten signed into law. 
It is time for Democrats to get seri-
ous and stop trying to score political 
points and come back to the negoti-
ating table. Let’s serve the American 
people by actually getting much-need-
ed bipartisan legislation signed into 
law to fight this virus and get our 
economy back. 
We have already proven how much 
good we can accomplish for American 
families and the American people when 
we work together.

RECOGNIZING HOPE LEE ON HIS 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Hope Lee, a revered constituent of New 
York’s 14th Congressional District who 
is celebrating his 100th birthday this 
year and has served so valiantly for our 
country. 
During World War II, Mr. Lee re-
ceived a Bronze Star Medal, two Purple 
Hearts, and a Combat Infantry Badge 
for his service to the country during 
World War II. 
Mr. Lee, in fact, was supposed to go 
to Washington, D.C., this year to get 
his Congressional Gold Medal of Honor 
this May, but it was postponed due to 
the pandemic. 
I think it is incredibly important to 
honor his work and his service here on 
the House floor. 
He is extraordinarily proud of his 
service in the U.S. military and hangs 
his American flag outside his house for 
every U.S. holiday. 
In fact, he and his wife, Rose Lee, 
have been happily married for 76 years, 
and Mr. Lee still does the cooking for 
himself and his wife. 
Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues 
to join me in recognizing Mr. Hope Lee. 
Thank you for your service, and 
happy birthday, Mr. Lee.

SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. WALTZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, as a 
combat veteran, I think a lot about my 
past experiences in battle and person-
ally have dealt with my own struggles, 
from PTS to survivor’s guilt. 
But this year, we are in a collective 
battle, and the front lines look very 
different. We are fighting against an 
invisible enemy, against COVID–19, and 
we are forced to distance ourselves and 
to change our entire way of life. This 
isolation is causing anxiety, depres-
sion, and sometimes takes us to even 
darker 
places, 
even 
with 
suicidal 
thoughts. 
September 
is 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Awareness Month, and I am teaming 
with a veterans group, Mission Roll 
Call, to raise awareness about suicide 
prevention, especially the 22 veterans 
per day we are currently losing. 
In combat, we are constantly check-
ing on our brothers and sisters to our 
left and our right, and we have to do 
the same back here at home. So I say 
to all veterans out there: Reach out. 
Ask your buddy how they are doing. 
Share a memory. Let them know that 
you are thinking about them and you 
have their back. 
Together, we are stronger. Together, 
we can win this fight.

NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, recovery 
is challenging and isolating even dur-
ing normal days, and this pandemic has 
only made it more difficult for those 
who suffer from addiction and sub-
stance use disorder. That is why Na-
tional Recovery Month, this month,

takes on even greater meaning as 
many are navigating isolation and dis-
tance from family and support net-
works. 
National Recovery Month is personal 
for me and my family. My son, Harry, 
is in long-term recovery from opioid 
addiction. Now he is healthy, he is 
well, and he works now to help others 
who struggle with substance abuse dis-
order. 
In his work, he reminds me that, dur-
ing the pandemic, so many have it even 
tougher on the road to recovery. He re-
minds me that not all are as fortunate 
as we have been, and we recognize Na-
tional Recovery Month for its impor-
tantly shining a light on this issue. 
I call on us to dedicate more re-
sources to support those suffering with 
addiction and substance use disorder to 
live happy, rewarding, healthy lives. 
And for those suffering with sub-
stance use disorders: You are not 
alone. There is hope. 
f 
STAND UP FOR POLICE 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, no 
matter your political affiliations in 
2001, there were no greater heroes than 
our first responders who risked their 
own lives to save their fellow citizens 
on 9/11. Republicans and Democrats 
thanked our first responders, while 
children across our Nation looked up to 
them as examples of what it meant to 
be heroes, to risk their own well-being 
in service to their fellow citizens. 
Now, across the Nation, we see a 
stark contrast to that scene from al-
most 20 years ago. Radicals now seek 
to defund the police. They threaten the 
men and women who risk their lives in 
service to our community, and, at 
times, they target our officers with vi-
olence, which, in the most tragic of 
cases, means these officers who are 
also fathers, mothers, sons, and daugh-
ters never return home to their family. 
I am calling on Members of Congress 
who have remained silent in recent 
months to now publicly oppose the vio-
lence against our law enforcement 
community so that we can put an end 
to the basic attacks against our first 
responders. 
f 
NATIONAL SUICIDE AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sep-
tember as National Suicide Prevention 
Month. 
Every year, close to 800,000 people die 
by suicide, leaving their family and 
friends to navigate the tragedy of loss. 
This is one death every 40 seconds. 
Studies by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention show that sui-
cide rates are rising, and suicide is the 
10th leading cause of death in the U.S. 
for all ages. 
This important month is a time to 
share resources and stories in an effort 
to shed light on this stigmatized topic. 
It is beneficial to learn and pay atten-
tion to the warning signs of suicide and 
periodically check in with friends and 
family 
members, 
especially 
during 
these challenging times. 
Additionally, talking about suicide 
in an open and caring way can help 
those 
who 
are 
having 
suicidal 
thoughts. As the isolating effects of 
the COVID–19 pandemic continue to 
grip our world, it is imperative we take 
our physical and mental health seri-
ously. 
I encourage everyone to educate 
themselves about suicide and the pa-
tient-centered resources available so 
we can help protect those in our com-
munities, friends, and loved ones. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEAN). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SHIMKUS), my good friend, great 
patriot, and veteran. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, as 
folks in the Chamber know, I have been 
taking some time to thank friends, 
family, and staff, for supporting me 
these 24 years as a Member of the 
House. 
Today, before I go down the organiza-
tional chart and mention caseworkers, 
legislative assistants, legislative cor-
respondents, staff assistants, sched-
ulers, there are some outliers in my or-
ganization that I need to mention. 
Mary Ellen, Mary Ellen Maxwell, and 
Maria Maxwell are all the same person. 
The Madonia family has strong roots in 
Springfield, Illinois, and in the Illinois 
Republican Party. 
Mary Ellen was on the campaign 
staff with me in 1996. Upon our victory, 
she joined the congressional staff. She 
eventually moved away and then got 
married. 
On returning to Illinois with Brad, 
she joined Team Shimkus as my cam-
paign treasurer. Her family also grew, 
adding Zane and Lilly. 
We continue to joke about how Gov-
ernor Edgar pointed to her at an event 
one time and said: ‘‘Oh, you are the one 
who is going to go jail.’’ Well, not only 
has she not gone to jail, she is a stick-
ler for the law, keeping us both out of 
trouble. 
Dora Rohan has spent 29 years work-
ing with me, protecting me, and being 
my friend. She started out as my exec-
utive assistant when I became treas-
urer of Madison County. As the only 
countywide elected Republican, I need-
ed a confidential employee whom I 
could trust. Dora fit the bill and also 
brought with her amazing secretarial 
skills, including shorthand. 
Dora followed me to my congres-
sional office and became a caseworker 
for the remainder of her professional 
career. Oh, the stories she could tell, 
and someday, I hope she will. 
I also appreciated the times when we 
did travel together. These trips pro-
vided me a different perspective and in-
sight to the goings on in my office, 
much to the chagrin of some of my 
other employees. 
I have had two great legislative as-
sistants who informally became part of 
my senior staff. Chris Sarley and Jor-
dan Haverly rose to prominence on 
their ability to handle policy, negotia-
tions, and the politics that arise from 
public policy. 
They both were what we called 
shared staff. Because of my role as ei-
ther chairman or ranking member of 
the Environment and Economy Sub-
committee, they were my primary 
point person with the full committee. 
They also played key roles in negotia-
tions with staff members of other of-
fices, from Republican offices and Dem-
ocrat offices. 
Chris Sarley and I had a lot of legis-
lative successes, and I could spend all 
my time on that. Another Illinois boy, 
but a Chicagolander, I was skeptical at 
first until I found out that he was a 
Sox fan, not a fan of that other team. 
Chris’ claim to fame is our success 
shepherding the Toxic Substance Con-
trol Act, commonly known as TSCA, 
through the legislative process and 
having it signed by President Obama. 
That piece of legislation took 51⁄2 years. 
This was the first rewrite of a major 
environmental law since it was passed 
in 1976. Praised by the chemical manu-
facturers and the environmental com-
munity, it is a perfect example of 
threading the needle to reform and up-
date an old law. 
Thank you, Chris. 
Jordan is from Pennsylvania and is 
also in his second tour of duty with my 
office. He handles my subcommittee 
now. With Democrats in charge, we at-
tempt to prevent overreach which is 
not scientifically supported and would 
hurt jobs in the economy. Many times 
doing nothing is better than doing 
something poorly. 
Jordan has a gift for working with 
social media. He also has a great han-
dle on who I am and how I would like 
to respond to most issues. He never lets 
me down. 
Jordan, like my legislative director, 
seems to want to go down with the 
ship. That is loyalty, which I appre-
ciate. He will be a great pick-up for 
any office. 
Madam Speaker, as I have said nu-
merous times, one is only as good as 
the people they have around them. 
These are some of the best, and I thank 
them. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. SHIMKUS for the wonderful 
tribute being paid. We will have to 
stand up here at some point and pay a 
wonderful tribute to Mr. SHIMKUS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4538 
September 17, 2020 
Obviously, there is a great deal of 
trouble going on, a lot of troubled peo-
ple in this country. It is interesting, 
recently, my wife had flown up to be 
here in Washington for the President’s 
speech on the White House grounds 
and, flying back, she noticed there 
were people with the BLM, Black Lives 
Matter, paraphernalia, things on there 
saying ‘‘BLM,’’ ‘‘Black Lives Matter.’’ 
It was interesting to hear, appar-
ently, some of the comments, and the 
comments had to do with the free plane 
tickets they got to fly up to protest 
here. One person said, yeah, they got a 
free minivan the whole time they were 
here. 
Somebody is paying for those items 
to come up and threaten and assault. 
Thankfully, there weren’t near as 
many batteries with the actual phys-
ical part of the assault, just threatened 
assaults. 
My wife and I, when we left the 
White House grounds up from the 
closed Pennsylvania part, trying to get 
down to our car in front of the Willard, 
we ended up being chased by a mob. 
The mob was on its way, and they were 
very loud and aggressive as they ran 
toward us, so I thought we will cut 
through the Willard, because I knew we 
would never make it all the way 
around the next block. 
There was a door there, a glass door, 
and I kept knocking on the door, and 
there were people at the other end of 
the hall. They could see us. Nobody 
would come open the door. 
Finally, the mob was getting closer 
as they were running toward us, and I 
said: Look, if they get here before this 
door gets open, you go ahead around 
the corner. I am sure they will be all 
enthralled with beating me. I don’t 
think they will come after you. Just 
get around the block. There are police 
at the other end of the next block. Just 
get there while they are after me. 
Don’t try to stay and defend me. 
But out of nowhere, this guy just 
comes up behind me—he worked for the 
Willard—scanned his card, opened the 
door right before the crowd got there. 
But it is just amazing, you know, 
who wants to inflict violence like that, 
and, more particularly, who is it that 
is funding people to come up and create 
havoc like that? 
In an article by Katharine Gorka a 
couple of days ago in The Federalist, 
entitled, ‘‘How the 1960s Riots Fore-
shadow 
Today’s 
Communist 
Weaponization of Black Pain’’—clear-
ly, there has been pain this country. 
George Floyd’s death was so unneces-
sary. It was outrageous. 
b 1545 
But who is paying? 
Who is stirring up all this violence to 
create more pain, more suffering, and 
more damage? 
It is a question worth finding an an-
swer for. 
I have thought numerous times about 
David Horowitz. I introduced him to 
someone some years back and said that 
he used to be a Socialist; and David, 
now 80, said, LOUIE, I wasn’t a Social-
ist, I was a Communist. I was a com-
plete Communist, man. 
David has written before about his 
turn from being a Communist in the 
sixties. One of the things that he had 
said hit him very hard was they were 
preparing for protests, and someone 
else was trying to encourage efforts to 
make the police overreact so that they 
would hurt one of them. David didn’t 
want anybody to get hurt or killed. He 
was told, We want the police to kill 
somebody because then we can ramp it 
up, and they won’t be able to stop us. 
He never signed on to get somebody 
killed. 
But if you study the Marxist revolu-
tion going back to 1917, the October 
Revolution—of course, there was one 
earlier that year—but the Bolsheviks 
weren’t the strongest party, the group 
of people at that time. There were so 
many things that could have gone 
wrong, but one thing they wanted to 
do—it is right out of the Marxist play-
book—was to create such chaos that 
your little group may have a chance to 
weasel into power and take over. 
We are seeing a lot of that play out 
in this country. Fortunately, we have 
people in authority in the Federal Gov-
ernment—at least most places in the 
Federal Government in this adminis-
tration, not all. We could improve 
some of the President’s appointments 
who didn’t turn out quite as strong as 
we had hoped. But we have to get to 
the bottom of who is paying, who is 
trying to get this thing all stirred up. 
This article from yesterday’s, Wash-
ington Times, Jeff Mordock: ‘‘Attorney 
General William P. Barr told federal 
prosecutors last week to charge violent 
demonstrators with a range of offenses, 
including sedition, a charge usually re-
served for someone plotting to over-
throw the government.’’ 
But that bears looking back at the 
Federal sedition charge, 18 U.S. Code 
2384 is seditious conspiracy. 
Some people I hear talk about it as 
this is treason. If you look at treason, 
both in the Constitution Article III, 
section 3, it is more about levying war 
against the United States Government. 
18 U.S.C. 2381 is treason, and it is giv-
ing aid and comfort to the enemies of 
the United States. So it is a tough go. 
But if you look at the seditious con-
spiracy: ‘‘If two or more persons in any 
State or Territory, or in any place sub-
ject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, conspire to overthrow, put 
down, or to destroy by force the Gov-
ernment of the United States, or to 
levy war against them, or to oppose by 
force the authority thereof, or by force 
to prevent, hinder, or delay the execu-
tion of any law of the United States, or 
by force to seize, take, or possess any 
property of the United States contrary 
to the authority thereof, they shall 
each be fined under this title or impris-
oned not more than 20 years, or both.’’ 
So that could very well come into 
play. 
Madam Speaker, I bring it up hoping 
that those who think it is just fun to 
create havoc, maybe throw Molotov 
cocktails or even pay for them or help 
supply them, help fund people who are 
going to come throw them or create 
havoc, then you are looking at 20 years 
just under that statute alone. 
I know under the doctrine of Posse 
Comitatus, from my days in the Army 
and since then, that some people are 
confused about the doctrine. They say 
that the President can never commit 
troops against American people. But 
we saw the Clinton administration uti-
lize vehicles and equipment—it had to 
have people helping from Fort Bliss, as 
I understand it, from back in those 
days—that ended up leading to the 
death of 70 or 80 people there outside of 
Waco. The President can, but he has to 
do it himself. That was one of the con-
fusing things back then. President 
Clinton, as I recall, was asked about it 
and he said something like, Oh, that is 
Reno’s deal. 
Well, you couldn’t utilize what was 
utilized against David Koresh with his 
confused personality, problematic as it 
was. Even that, you couldn’t use mili-
tary resources without the President’s 
approval. So we never found out how in 
the world the orders were given, if the 
President himself didn’t give it. That 
was a violation of the law. 
But here in 10 U.S. Code 253, it says, 
‘‘The President, by using the militia or 
the armed forces, or both, or by any 
other means, shall take such measures 
as he considers necessary to suppress, 
in a State, any insurrection, domestic 
violence, 
unlawful 
combination, 
or 
conspiracy . . .’’ 
But you note the words ‘‘domestic vi-
olence.’’ It goes on. 
‘‘If it so hinders the execution of the 
laws of that State, and of the United 
States within the State, that any part 
or class of its people is deprived of a 
right, privilege, immunity, or protec-
tion named in the Constitution and se-
cured by law . . .’’ 
So it is wide open to being used in 
some of these riots where people’s life, 
liberty, and certainly their property is 
not being protected, it is being over-
whelmed. I think the President is right 
to give Governors and mayors the 
chance to protect their people, but at 
some point if it is not done, this ought 
to make clear to those Governors and 
mayors who aren’t protecting their 
people, the President has authority to 
send in people to put down what ap-
pears to be sedition. This violence real-
ly is Marxist violence. 
It says in their title, Black Lives 
Matter. But if you look at what they 
are in favor of, it is not about Black 
lives mattering; it is things like de-
stroying the family. Of course, BLM 
calls it the Western-style family, and 
that alone is just completely fiction. 
The families we have traditionally 
known in the United States since our 
very inception weren’t Western style. 
These were Middle Eastern. These 
came from Moses and from Christians

or Jews who believed what Moses said 
was inspired or provided by God. He 
said that a man shall leave his father 
and mother, a woman will leave her 
home, and the two will become one. 
Years later Jesus is asked about mar-
riage and divorce. He quotes Moses ver-
batim and then adds the line: What 
God has joined together let nobody sep-
arate. So we didn’t come up with that 
type of marriage. It is not Western 
style. We have to give credit where 
credit is due. It is Middle-Eastern 
style. It is from Moses. It is from 
Jesus. So you can’t really take credit 
for that. 
But, then, again, when you are a 
Marxist group dedicated to the over-
throw of the government and replacing 
it with a Socialist, Communist, Pro-
gressive, whatever you want to call it, 
that is the way they go. That is the di-
rection. You destroy the history so you 
can’t learn from prior mistakes and 
you can’t learn from prior successes, 
you just rewrite the history. Orwell 
had a lot to say about that. 
There is a study—as this article from 
The Federalist points out by Joy 
Pullmann—up to 95 percent of 2020 U.S. 
riots are linked to Black Lives Matter. 
That is quite a good article and quite 
informative. 
But then this article by Edwin Mora 
says 
that 
a 
pro-Communist China 
group is funding a Black Lives Matter- 
linked organization. It points out that 
a pro-Communist China group, the Chi-
nese Progressive Association in San 
Francisco, is actively funding a ven-
ture by Black Lives Matter cofounder 
and unabashedly anti-capitalist, Alicia 
Garza. 
Another article by Peter Hasson from 
2 days ago points out that Black Lives 
Matter cofounder Alicia Garza in 2015 
said that capitalism must be abolished 
for Black lives to matter. 
So, basically, they are pushing for 
the destruction of our Constitution- 
based government, and they are cre-
ating all kinds of chaos. 
So it shouldn’t surprise anybody who 
saw the article yesterday by Douglas 
Ernst that that Jesus statue that is 90 
years old was destroyed at St. Pat-
rick’s Cathedral in El Paso, the quote 
here is: I am in shock. 
But that is what Socialist, Com-
munist, Progressives push. If you look 
at what Communists, Socialists have 
done, it is clear: you have to get rid of 
any belief in anything except the gov-
ernment. 
As I have mentioned before, when I 
was an exchange student in the Soviet 
Union, there were eight Americans 
that summer from the U.S. We went to 
the former city—it was the only recog-
nized Christian seminary in the Soviet 
Union at the time—of Zagorsk. There 
was a building—as you would turn into 
the walled area of Zagorsk, there was a 
building there with a painting of 
Lenin’s face and above it Lenin. Below 
it was ‘‘Lenin s nami,’’ Lenin is with 
us. So you may be turning in here to 
learn about Jesus, but just remember 
it is Lenin who is with us, nobody else. 
That is the message. 
It actually made me nauseous to go 
into an old church in Moscow that had 
a stained glass window with big gor-
geous colors; instead of Jesus with all 
the children suffering to come under 
Him, it was Lenin sitting as Jesus is 
often depicted surrounded by the chil-
dren. It was a bit sickening to go into 
the massive cathedral there in what 
was then St. Petersburg originally, 
then it became Leningrad. But that 
gorgeous, massive cathedral had been 
converted to a museum of atheism and 
evolution—just incredible. 
But that is where this all has to go if 
you are going to have a successful de-
struction of the freedoms we have and 
go to government control and govern-
ment ownership and no private prop-
erty. That is where it all ends up, if we 
don’t get it stopped. It will mean the 
end of the country that afforded the 
greatest opportunities individually, the 
greatest assets individually, and the 
highest standard of living. 
It is tragic that we have poverty in 
the United States, tragic that we still 
have any homelessness at all that 
hasn’t apparently improved a whole lot 
since the War on Poverty started tril-
lions of dollars ago, but even so, we 
still had the highest standard of living 
and opportunities, I would submit, in 
history. It is what freedom and private 
property has brought—innovation, the 
greatest innovation in the history of 
the world. But that is all in jeopardy 
right now, and Americans better wake 
up. It is all at risk. 
These Marxist revolutionaries need 
to be stopped. It is sedition. It is a vio-
lation of Federal and most State law, 
and it is time to put it to an end. If the 
Governors and mayors who have been 
allowing 
this 
to 
go 
on—depriving 
Americans of their life, liberty, pursuit 
of happiness on their own property— 
then it will be time for the President 
to use these Federal statutes to step in 
and bring peace to the country once 
again, so we can go through our lives 
without worrying about being chased 
by a mob that is upset with you just 
because you went and heard a speech. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

S5681 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2020 
No. 161 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:45 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who makes us one, use 
our lawmakers today as agents of rec-
onciliation. Lord, give them the wis-
dom to build bridges that will enable 
diverse people to accomplish Your pur-
poses on Earth. Lord, inspire our Sen-
ators with such oneness of spirit and 
resolve that they will provide our Na-
tion with a model of cooperation. Re-
mind them of the wisdom of Matthew 
12:25, which states that a house divided 
against itself cannot stand. 
Lord, we thank You for giving Sen-
ator GRASSLEY another birthday. 
We pray in Your unifying Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
first of all, I thank the chaplain for the 
happy birthday that was part of the 
prayer. So they heard it in Heaven, as 
well as throughout the United States. 
Before the 2016 election, Democrats 
speculated very feverishly: Would Don-
ald Trump accept the results of the 
election of 2016? 
Then he won, and it is the Democrats 
who have refused to accept the result. 
They sought to delegitimize the elec-
tion, citing Russia’s meddling or ques-
tioning our Presidential election sys-
tem. On Inauguration Day, you know 
the famous Washington Post headline 
said it all: ‘‘The campaign to impeach 
President Trump has begun.’’ He was 
President about 1 hour at that time. 
In fact, we now know that efforts to 
fabricate a Russia collusion narrative 
were already under way well before the 
President was inaugurated. The same 
people are again fretting that Presi-
dent Trump might not somehow accept 
the election results if he loses. And, of 
course, under our Constitution, no 
President has any option but to accept 
those results because the term ends on 
January 20. 
But can’t we also ask the alter-
native? What if President Trump does 
win? Well, this was the advice from 
Hillary Clinton to former Vice Presi-
dent Biden: that Biden ‘‘should not 
concede under any circumstances.’’ 
So will the Democrats respect the 
election results this time? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this morning I was planning to address 
a number of topics, but the President 
held 
a 
press 
conference 
yesterday 
afternoon that was so callous, so unin-
formed, so egomaniacal, so divisive 
that I am compelled to respond to it 
this morning. 
We are in the middle of a global pan-
demic that has killed nearly 200,000 
Americans, far more than the number 
of Americans who died in World War 
I—more than any other Nation on 
God’s green Earth, more than countries 
with larger populations, and more than 
countries with mere fractions of our 
wealth and power. 
Here is how the President spoke 
about the number of American deaths 
yesterday at his press conference: 
If you take the blue states out, we’re at a 
level that I don’t think anybody in the world 
would be at . . . [If you take the blue states 
out,] we’re really at a very low level. 
Yes, Mr. President, if you don’t count 
the total number of Americans who 
have died, you might think it is not so 
bad. If you close your eyes and pretend 
that half of the country doesn’t exist, 
maybe some might think you didn’t do 
such a spectacularly awful job. 
What kind of person looks at the 
number of dead citizens in the country 
he is supposed to lead, and in an at-
tempt to glamorize himself, dismisses 
every American who died in a State 
that didn’t support the President po-
litically? What a disgrace. It is mon-
strous. There is not a shred of empa-
thy, not an ounce of sorrow. What kind 
of President do we have? 
The President just wants you to see a 
graph about how his catastrophic fail-
ure to fight COVID–19 could have been 
worse. 
I suggest President Trump spend 
some time reading the stories of the 
men and women across the country 
who have passed away from this ter-
rible virus. 
This isn’t about a number. Oh, no, it 
is about the people families and com-
munities have lost, whether they be in 
red States or blue States. Many of 
these families have been unable to hold

funeral services to properly mourn 
their loved ones for fear of spreading 
COVID to another member of their 
family. That is why these remarks by 
the President are so horrific. 
What does the outcome of an election 
determine if these lives should be 
counted? Isn’t that awful? Why does 
the outcome of an election determine if 
these lives should be counted? Does he 
mean that the loss of Americans who 
lived in States with Democratic Gov-
ernors shouldn’t count? If that is the 
case, President Trump is saying that 
the deaths of David Pickman of Som-
erset, CT; and Patrick McNamee of Yp-
silanti, MI; and Virgil Sutton of Dallas, 
NC, don’t count—don’t count. How 
about Ralph Davis, the high school bas-
ketball coach in Milwaukee, WI? Did 
his life not count because he lived in a 
State with a Democratic Governor? 
What kind of demented person would 
say that those American lives don’t 
count? 
The President also said: ‘‘But some of 
those states, they were blue States and 
blue-state managed.’’ 
I suppose that means that the life of 
Dennis Wilson shouldn’t count because 
he was an educator in Lenexa, KS. If 
only Mr. Wilson had lived 17 miles east 
in the Hickman Hills neighborhood of 
Kansas City, MO, maybe the President 
would think his life should have count-
ed. 
How about Captain Doug Hickok? If 
he lived—I don’t know—in Cheyenne, 
WY, I suppose the President might 
have valued his life. Unfortunately for 
Captain Hickok, he lived 1,700 miles 
east in Bangor, PA, so President 
Trump says his life isn’t worth count-
ing. 
Maybe I am giving the President too 
much credit. You never really know 
what the heck he means when he talks. 
So it is possible that his definition of 
blue States isn’t limited to States with 
Democratic Governors. Maybe his defi-
nition of blue States includes States 
with more Democrats than Republicans 
in 
their 
congressional 
delegations. 
That 
would 
mean 
Valentina 
Blackhorse’s life didn’t count because 
she lived in Kayenta, AZ, nor would 
the life of a Des Moines toddler who 
died from COVID in June. 
What kind of demented person would 
make 
that 
calculation? 
President 
Trump, that is who. 
Of course, there is no bottom with 
President Trump. He is so contemp-
tuous of every virtue, so dishonorable, 
so dishonest that the vices parade 
themselves forward one after another. 
At the press conference after his dis-
gusting 
comments 
about 
ignoring 
American lives from blue States, Presi-
dent Trump lied, once again, about his 
support for Americans with preexisting 
conditions, a lie he has told and retold 
while his administration is in court 
suing to eliminate those very protec-
tions. 
Don’t 
worry, 
though. 
President 
Trump promised that a brandnew, fan-
tastic Republican healthcare plan is 
just around the corner. He said you 
will see it in 2 weeks, just like he told 
FOX News in July when he said he 
would sign a healthcare plan in 2 
weeks, a full and complete healthcare 
plan, and again in August, just 2 weeks 
away—just like his infrastructure bill, 
a new middle-class tax cut, lower pre-
scription drug costs, a new stimulus 
package, a report on COVID–19’s im-
pact on minorities, and new COVID 
tests, all of which the President said 
would be ‘‘2 weeks’’ away but, in fact, 
never materialized, not in 2 weeks, not 
ever. 
He must think the American people 
are chumps that he can say anything 
he wants with no accountability, not 
do it, and then do it again and again 
and again. 
For centuries, American Presidents 
have faced challenges with honor and 
with courage. They have stepped up to 
the podium and used their bully pulpit 
to give honor to American lives. But 
when this President, President Trump, 
stands at that great podium, he reveals 
his cowardice, his callousness, his self-
ishness, his ignorance, and, most of all, 
his insistence on dividing us. His in-
ability and unwillingness to unite a 
grieving nation will be his legacy. 
When Donald Trump took the stage 
at the 2016 National Republican Con-
vention, he painted a false portrait of a 
country in crisis, and declared, ‘‘I 
alone can fix it.’’ 
Four years later, the country faces 
actual crises—the greatest economic 
crisis in 75 years, the greatest public 
health crisis in a century—and Presi-
dent Trump now says: ‘‘It is what it 
is.’’ 
‘‘Could you have done more to stop 
it?’’ 
‘‘I don’t think so,’’ he says. 
‘‘If you take the blue States out. . . . 
We’re really at a very low level.’’ 
‘‘I don’t take any responsibility at 
all.’’ 
‘‘It’s going to disappear.’’ 
‘‘A lot of people think the masks are 
no good.’’ 
‘‘[W]hen it gets a little warmer, it 
miraculously goes away.’’ 
‘‘I see the disinfectant, [where it] 
knocks it out in a minute . . . and is 
there a way [we] can do something like 
that, by injection?’’ 
‘‘I’m not a doctor, but I’m, like, a 
person that has a good, you know 
what.’’ 
This man, who said all these ridicu-
lous, harmful things, is leading the 
country 
through 
the 
worst 
public 
health crisis in a century. 
Americans don’t have to ask them-
selves, as Reagan once asked, if they 
are better off now than 4 years ago. 
President Trump has told everyone ex-
actly what the score is. 
When Donald Trump said he was run-
ning for office, he said: ‘‘I alone can fix 
it.’’ When Donald Trump is running the 
country during the worst pandemic in 
this century, he says: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
Five words. Both times, five words. 
Five words that sum up an approach to 
government and leadership that is 
completely antithetical to everything 
the word ‘‘leadership’’ means. 
Promise big, deliver zero, deliver 
small. That is President Trump’s view 
of government. Boast when you don’t 
have any responsibility; shrink from it 
when 
you 
do. 
That 
is 
President 
Trump’s view of public service. 
It has diminished our institutions 
and our democracy. He has cost our 
country its moral standing in the 
world; he has threatened the future of 
our planet; and he has cost Americans 
their healthcare, their jobs, and their 
lives. But it is not so bad if you don’t 
count the numbers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

for the quorum call be rescinded.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our Democratic colleagues have sought 
to spend this week discussing election 
security. Well, they really have sought 
to discuss absolutely anything besides 
pandemic relief since their leaders are 
still blocking bipartisan negotiations 
that could actually get a result. 
So our friends across the aisle have 
tried to change the subject to election 
security or immigration from Ven-
ezuela or anything besides the hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in relief 
they have been filibustering. 
But the integrity of our democracy is 
a crucial issue. We are fewer than 50 
days from November 3. Every voter de-
serves to know their State and local 
authorities are as well equipped as pos-
sible to oversee fair, safe, and secure 
elections. 
So let’s discuss the progress made 
since back in 2016, the threats still be-
fore us, and how it is when this non-
partisan issue gets hijacked—literally 
hijacked—for partisan point-scoring. 
Here is how the Democratic vice 
chair of the Intelligence Committee de-
scribed our vulnerability to foreign in-
fluence in 2016 during the Obama-Biden 
administration. This is the Democratic 
vice chairman of the Intelligence Com-
mittee about 2016. He said: ‘‘We were 
caught flat-footed.’’ ‘‘We were caught 
flat-footed.’’ 
That administration’s relationships 
with State governments were dysfunc-
tional; information sharing was weak; 
cross-sector partnerships hardly ex-
isted; and 8 years of weak foreign pol-
icy had emboldened Putin to push the 
envelope.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5683 
September 17, 2020 
Now, for the last 4 years, thanks to 
the actions of this Senate and the lead-
ership of the current administration, a 
huge number of dedicated experts have 
worked hard to improve our defenses 
and regain America’s trust. 
In 2016, the Department of Homeland 
Security was on an island, but under 
this administration, DHS officials have 
built partnerships with State and local 
officials who run our elections and 
stood up massive intelligence-sharing 
efforts that connect them with Federal 
authorities, the intelligence commu-
nity, as well as the private sector. 
In 2016, the outgoing administration 
hid their limited grasp of the threat 
from Congress and the American peo-
ple. The Trump administration and in-
telligence experts have been far, far 
more transparent. 
In 2016, only 14 State or local au-
thorities had high-tech sensors to de-
tect cyberattacks. Now all 50 States— 
all of them—have them. The Trump ad-
ministration has imposed real pain on 
Russia: closing consulates, expelling 
spies, sanctioning oligarchs and agents 
of influence, and equipping neighbors 
that are threatened by Moscow to deter 
further aggression. 
Here in the Senate, multiple commit-
tees have become major players in this 
effort. Our colleagues on the Intel-
ligence 
Committee 
spent, 
literally, 
years producing their 5-part, 1,300-plus- 
page report on what happened back in 
2016. Some of their bipartisan rec-
ommendations are already taking ef-
fect. 
And then there is funding. The Sen-
ate has led the efforts to set aside more 
than $1 billion in extra election assist-
ance, from foreign interference to 
COVID–19. Through the end of the pri-
maries, more than 70 percent of the 
huge sum we provided in the CARES 
Act is still unspent. As recently as a 
few months ago, more than 60 percent 
of the first tranche we provided all the 
way back in fiscal 2018 was still 
unspent. So we have made sure money 
is not an obstacle. 
So these threats are still with us, and 
they have evolved. Not only Russia but 
also China, Iran, and other adversaries 
are looking constantly for ways to 
interfere in our politics, divide Ameri-
cans, and erode confidence in our insti-
tutions. That is a fact. 
The work goes on, but we certainly 
aren’t flat-footed any longer. This 
progress should be cause for bipartisan 
celebration, but one side of the aisle 
seems 
to 
prefer 
pretending—pre-
tending—there 
hasn’t 
been 
any 
progress at all. 
Frankly, while nonpartisan experts 
worked around the clock to fight our 
adversaries’ destabilizing efforts, too 
many Democrats have been under-
mining America’s confidence in our de-
mocracy to the degree that those ad-
versaries could only dream of: baseless 
accusations that the last election was 
stolen; casual assertions that this one, 
too, must be illegitimate if they don’t 
win. 
On a monthly basis, we have heard 
new, hysterical pronouncements that 
our democracy was on death’s door. 
Even 
sensitive 
intelligence 
became 
grist for the partisan mill. 
This has not been universal. There 
has been good bipartisan work in some 
committees, but the Democratic lead-
ership appeared to make a conscious 
choice: Instead of treating election se-
curity like the unifying, bipartisan 
issue it ought to be, they would use it 
as a partisan cudgel to hit the other 
side, playing right into our adversaries’ 
hands. 
This week, the Democratic leader at-
tacked Republicans and basically ques-
tioned our patriotism because we did 
not rush to meet his latest demands for 
empty theatrics. He proposes to crowd 
out 4 years of bipartisan work from ac-
tual 
committees 
by 
inventing 
a 
brandnew Senate committee and pull 
experts off the frontlines during the 
home stretch for theatrical hearings 
here on Capitol Hill. 
He says we must allocate more 
money. Never mind that the millions 
and millions of dollars we have already 
set aside remain unspent. He proposes 
that the administration pull experts off 
the frontlines to continue briefing him. 
Never mind that ODNI alone has sup-
ported 53 election security briefings to 
Congress since 2018—53 election secu-
rity briefings to Congress since 2018. I 
am sure 54 will be the magic number 
that finally makes our colleague a rea-
sonable voice on this issue. 
The truth is, briefings are ongoing; 
the Intelligence and Armed Services 
Committees will be briefed this week; 
and all Senators will have access to 
written intelligence analysis by career 
professionals if new developments arise 
since last month’s all-Senate briefings. 
The Democratic leader’s demands 
aren’t solutions. These aren’t what the 
experts say we need; they are just 
empty gestures concocted so the Demo-
cratic leader can complain that Repub-
licans hate democracy and apple pie 
when we don’t go along with them. 
So remember, fear and division, re-
duced confidence in our democracy, 
Americans divided against ourselves: 
that is exactly what Russia wants—ex-
actly. That is what China wants too. 
That is just what our adversaries want 
to achieve, and it is exactly what the 
Democratic leader helps them achieve 
when he turns a bipartisan national 
issue that should unite us into one 
more pretext for partisan finger-point-
ing. 
Our colleague from New York said re-
cently 
that 
‘‘Republicans 
are 
the 
enemy of the good.’’ No, Republicans 
and Democrats are not enemies. No fel-
low Americans are enemies. 
Our people, our democracy, have real 
enemies in some corners of the world. I 
expect they are absolutely thrilled to 
hear our own politicians talking that 
way.

HOT SPRINGS VA FACILITY 
Mr. 
THUNE. 
Madam 
President, 
South Dakota’s veterans and the Hot 
Springs community are currently cele-
brating the VA’s announcement that it 
has begun the process of rescinding its 
order to close the Hot Springs VA facil-
ity. This was a hard-fought victory in a 
battle that we weren’t always sure we 
would win. It started almost a decade 
ago, in 2011, when the Obama adminis-
tration announced its plans to re-
align—when I say ‘‘realign,’’ reclose— 
the Hot Springs VA facility. 
I was well aware of what the Hot 
Springs facility means to South Da-
kota veterans and to the entire Hot 
Springs community, and I determined 
that there wasn’t going to be a closure 
if I could help it. I knew that closing 
the Hot Springs facility would put ac-
cessible care out of the reach of a lot of 
rural and Tribal veterans—not only 
rural and Tribal South Dakota vet-
erans but rural and Tribal veterans 
from neighboring Wyoming and Ne-
braska who depend on the Hot Springs 
facility for care. 
Traveling to Rapid City and Fort 
Meade for care, as the VA proposed, 
would be a real hardship, if not an im-
possibility, for many of these veterans. 
I also strongly disagreed with moving 
not only medical care but the vital 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Pro-
gram from Hot Springs. Not only would 
this put the program out of reach of 
some veterans, I believed it was also a 
mistake to remove a tremendously ef-
fective program from the place where 
it has been so successful and try to re-
constitute it elsewhere. 
I got to work in Congress, along with 
other Members of the South Dakota 
delegation. My first priority was sim-
ply trying to get Hot Springs’ veterans 
a hearing with the VA. 
In 2016, after years of trying, we per-
suaded then-VA Secretary Bob McDon-
ald to visit Hot Springs. Unfortu-
nately, the visit didn’t work, and soon

S5684 
September 17, 2020 
after the Secretary signed an order fi-
nalizing the decision to close the ma-
jority of the facility. 
The battle wasn’t over. In 2014, I had 
succeeded in attaching a measure to an 
appropriations legislation prohibiting 
the closure of the Hot Springs facility 
until a national VA realignment strat-
egy was proposed. In each year, with 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, I have managed to renew 
this measure. And after a new VA Sec-
retary—Secretary Robert Wilkie—took 
the helm, I repeatedly urged him to 
come to Hot Springs and to check out 
our facility for himself. Early this 
year, the Secretary announced that he 
would visit the facility in March. 
I then organized a letter with the 
rest of the South Dakota delegation 
strongly urging the Secretary to make 
time to sit down with Hot Springs vet-
erans and other stakeholders and listen 
to their concerns about the planned 
closure. To our great gratitude, the 
Secretary agreed. 
Early in Secretary Wilkie’s visit to 
Hot Springs on March 2, I requested 
that he revisit the order to close the 
facility signed over 3 years ago. A bit 
to our surprise and much to our relief, 
the Secretary agreed, reassuring us 
that the Hot Springs VA would remain 
open for our veterans. 
That meeting with veterans was piv-
otal. I worked hard in Congress—along 
with other Members of the South Da-
kota 
delegation—to 
keep 
the 
Hot 
Springs facility open. But the cam-
paign would never have succeeded 
without the passion of Hot Springs vet-
erans and the Hot Springs community, 
which rallied in support of the facility 
and have proposed innovative ideas for 
the campus’s future. And meeting with 
these veterans and other stakeholders 
and hearing their thoughts and stories 
played a major role in Secretary 
Wilkie’s decision. 
Now, 2020 has been a tough year. But 
even in tough times, good things can 
happen. And last week’s announcement 
that the VA has begun the formal proc-
ess of rescinding its order to close the 
Hot Springs facility, expected to take 
30 to 60 days, has given a lot of us rea-
son for gratitude. I am thankful to Sec-
retary Wilkie for taking a real look at 
South Dakota veterans’ concerns and 
reversing the VA’s decision to close the 
facility. And I look forward to cele-
brating with South Dakota veterans 
the next time I am in Hot Springs—or, 
as a lot of us know it, the ‘‘Veterans 
Town.’’ 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. President, while most sectors of 
our economy were thriving before the 
coronavirus pandemic hit, farmers and 
ranchers were struggling. Low prices, 
extended trade disputes, and natural 
disasters had meant a lot of tough few 
years for agriculture producers even 
before the arrival of the coronavirus. 
Yesterday, I held virtual meetings 
with South Dakota farmers and ranch-
ers and heard firsthand about the chal-
lenges they are facing because of the 
pandemic. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
home State of South Dakota, and mak-
ing sure our ag producers have what 
they need to keep feeding our Nation— 
and the world—is one of my top prior-
ities here in Washington. 
During debate on the CARES Act— 
our largest coronavirus relief bill to 
date—I fought to make sure that we in-
cluded relief for farmers and ranchers. 
The final bill included $14 billion for 
the Commodity Credit Corporation, 
plus an additional $9.5 billion in emer-
gency support to allow the Department 
of Agriculture to provide income and 
price support for farmers and ranchers. 
USDA has been putting these re-
sources to work to provide assistance 
to producers in South Dakota and 
across the country who were affected 
by the pandemic, and they have been a 
lifeline to many farmers. But more 
needs to be done to support our Na-
tion’s agriculture industry. And part of 
doing that is funding the Commodity 
Credit Corporation in the continuing 
resolution—the appropriations measure 
that hopefully Congress will be consid-
ering soon. 
The Commodity Credit Corporation 
ensures that USDA has the resources it 
needs to provide assistance through 
farm programs, including the programs 
included in the bipartisan 2018 farm 
bill—commodity programs like the Ag-
riculture Risk Coverage, we call it the 
ARC Program; the Price Loss Cov-
erage, what we call the PLC Program; 
and Marketing Assistance Loans; dairy 
programs like the Dairy Margin pro-
grams; disaster programs, like the 
Livestock Forage Disaster Program; 
and the Livestock Indemnity Program. 
These programs are a critical part of 
farmers and ranchers’ safety net, and 
we need to ensure that they are fully 
funded. 
Later this morning, my colleague 
Senator HOEVEN
from North Dakota 
will be hosting a colloquy to draw at-
tention to the need to get USDA the 
resources it requires to help our agri-
culture producers weather this crisis. I 
appreciate Senator HOEVEN’s work to 
highlight this issue, and I hope my 
Democratic colleagues will hear agri-
culture producers’ concerns. 
I see my colleague, the chairman of 
the Agriculture Committee—the com-
mittee on which I serve—is here as well 
to talk about these issues and to point 
to the need to ensure that we are doing 
everything we can to support our Na-
tion’s farmers and ranchers during this 
time of incredible challenge. 
I look forward to working with the 
chairman of the Ag Committee and our 
other colleagues from our agriculture 
States—many of whom will be here mo-
mentarily to talk about this issue—to 
help our ranchers and farmers face 
down the challenges that are in front 
of them. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
work with Republicans to make sure 
that USDA has the resources it needs 
to support our agricultural producers— 
the men and women who feed not only 
this country but the entire world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator THUNE for his 
very pertinent and cogent remarks. 
This is an important time to make a 
decision that affects all farmers and 
ranchers and growers all across our 
country during a time in which we are 
going through some very difficult 
times—weather and everything else 
that you can imagine. 
I see Senator ERNST over there, who 
will be following me, I am assuming. 
I want to thank Senator HOEVEN for 
reserving this time, as other members 
of the Agricultural Committee come 
and 
speak 
on 
an 
issue 
that 
we 
shouldn’t really be having an issue. 
As I said, I rise to engage in a col-
loquy on the importance of providing 
certainty and predictability. Those 
were the watch words we used when we 
passed the farm bill. To our Nation’s 
farmers, ranchers, and growers, by re-
plenishing the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration, there should not be an issue. 
First, I would like to thank Senator 
HOEVEN, who has just arrived on the 
floor, for his leadership and speaking 
to this issue, and other Senators for 
their commitment to agriculture in 
their respective States and across the 
country. No matter what they grow or 
where they live, farmers, ranchers, and 
growers have done their part to ensure 
the U.S. food, fiber, and fuel supply 
continues without disruption during 
these unprecedented times. 
I think everybody is familiar with 
the situation. Every 5 years, Congress 
passes legislation that sets the na-
tional agriculture, nutrition, conserva-
tion, and forestry policy—commonly 
referred to as the farm bill. That is our 
commitment, and we did that. These 
are for the folks on the frontlines, in 
the fields, caring for livestock, man-
aging the lands day in and day out, de-
spite all the weather problems we are 
having today. 
As chairman of this committee—the 
Senate 
Agriculture, 
Nutrition, 
and 
Forestry Committee—we were success-
ful in passing the 2018 farm bill in a bi-
partisan manner. Everybody says: Oh, 
we have to work together to get back 
to where we were bipartisan. We were. 
Eighty-seven Members in this Chamber 
voted in favor of this legislation. 
That vote demonstrated that the 2018 
farm bill did provide much certainty 
and predictability to all farmers and 
ranchers across all regions and all 
crops. However, it is no secret that 
times continue to remain tough in 
farm country. Farmers and ranchers 
continue to experience low commodity 
prices, a global pandemic, natural dis-
asters, and the effects of retaliatory 
tariffs. That is a terrible combination. 
The 2018 farm bill does provide essen-
tial programs to producers that allow 
them to mitigate some of the risks— 
some of the risks—that are outside 
their control. Many of these programs 
are implemented through the authority

and the annual funding Congress pro-
vides to Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion, or the CCC. 
I want to stress to my colleagues 
that now is not the time for partisan 
gamesmanship. If Congress does not re-
plenish the CCC, it could significantly 
harm or even halt these important pro-
grams. I can’t imagine doing that. 
Farmers, ranchers, and others in farm 
country are counting on us to do our 
job. In fact, we have heard loud and 
clear from over 40 different organiza-
tions representing farmers, ranchers, 
and other rural stakeholders across the 
country that the CCC must be reim-
bursed before the end of the fiscal year. 
I want to say this and make this em-
phatically clear: Failure to do so would 
result in delays of the 2018 farm bill 
programs. We are talking about other 
programs because of COVID–19 and the 
pandemic and all of that. But even dur-
ing a global pandemic, U.S. farmers 
and ranchers continue to hold up their 
end of the bargain by producing their 
crops for the world’s safest, most af-
fordable food supply. The least we can 
do is to ensure that the 2018 farm bill— 
the piece of legislation that received 87 
votes in this body right here in the 
Senate—continues to be fully imple-
mented, on time, and without delay. 
I hope that we can reach a bipartisan 
agreement. This business of at least 
holding up the CCC funds—I under-
stand what people have with regard to 
their own top things that they want to 
get accomplished, but holding up the 
CCC is not an answer. 
I look forward to working with my 
Senate colleagues in a bipartisan way 
to ensure that we provide farmers and 
ranchers with certainty and predict-
ability from the 2018 farm bill. 
I thank the distinguished Senator, 
Mr. HOEVEN, for asking for this time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
want to thank our Ag chairman. I want 
to thank him for being here today. I 
want to thank him for his many, many 
years of service in this body. And most 
of all, what I want to thank him for 
today is his leadership on farm issues, 
on ag issues, on working on behalf of 
our farmers and ranchers, and in work-
ing in a very bipartisan way. That is 
what he is here doing. 
You heard from our whip, the Sen-
ator from South Dakota, an ag State. 
You heard from our Ag chairman, the 
Senator from Kansas, an ag State. You 
are going to hear from other members 
of our Ag Committee. You are going to 
hear from the Senator from Iowa, an ag 
State. You are going to hear from Sen-
ator BOOZMAN from Arkansas, an ag 
State; 
from 
Senator 
FISCHER, 
Ne-
braska, obviously a big farm and ranch 
State; the Presiding Officer, I know, 
would be right here speaking with us if 
he weren’t presiding—again, an ag 
State. 
What this is all about today is mak-
ing sure that we support farmers and 
ranchers. We are here in a very posi-
tive, encouraging way, and it is to 
make the point that we need to get as-
sistance to our farmers and ranchers. 
We have some of that available. We 
have about $14 billion that we secured 
in the CARES Act that is ready to go 
out. It is ready to go. 
We have done a ton of work with the 
USDA. We want to thank the Ag Sec-
retary, Sonny Perdue. Georgia is an-
other ag State. His whole team worked 
hard on this. We worked hard with 
him. 
That $14 billion needs to get out to 
our farmers and ranchers and across 
the country. It really touches just 
about every State. 
Then we need to replenish the Com-
modity Credit Corporation, the CCC. I 
chair Ag Appropriations. I work with 
that every year. There is about $30 bil-
lion, year in and year out, that goes in 
it. This is not a new thing. This is 
something we do every year. We need 
to get that done now in the CR so we 
can continue to provide that help and 
support for our farmers and our ranch-
ers. This is what funds the key farm 
programs. 
The countercyclical safety net. Very 
key programs—ARC, AGRIS coverage, 
and PLC, price loss coverage—are fund-
ed by the CCC. That is just fundable— 
that is the heart and soul of the bipar-
tisan farm program we passed, as our 
Ag chairman just described. It is bipar-
tisan, strongly supported in our com-
mittee, and strongly supported on the 
floor of this body, as well as in the 
House. As I say, this funding is the 
heart and soul of the farm program. It 
also funds conservation programs and 
other things. That safety net that our 
farmers and ranchers rely on every 
year is what is funded through the 
CCC. That is why we are here today. 
As our Ag chairman said, we have 
over 40 farm groups from across the 
country that sent a letter to leadership 
and said: Absolutely, not only move 
forward with this aid we are talking 
about, the $14 billion we have gotten 
through CARES—and I think we are 
close to getting there again, thanks to 
the USDA. I think you will see that 
very soon. But absolutely take that 
step to replenish the CCC so that we 
can continue to provide that counter-
cyclical safety net, that farm program 
our farmers and our ranchers depend 
on. 
Remember, this isn’t just about our 
farmers and ranchers. This isn’t just 
about good farm policy. In this coun-
try, we have the lowest cost, highest 
quality food supply in the world that 
benefits every single American every 
single day because of our farmers and 
ranchers. That is how important this 
is. 
Let me turn next to my colleagues. I 
am going to turn to the Senator from 
Nebraska. She is a cattle rancher. Who 
better to hear from next than Senator 
FISCHER from Nebraska, a cattle ranch-
er herself? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. I want to thank my 
colleague from North Dakota. 
It is so appropriate, Madam Presi-
dent, that you are in the chair right 
now presiding because you are a cattle 
farmer from the great State of Mis-
sissippi, and we have many, many dis-
cussions on the importance of livestock 
and on the importance of agriculture 
to our States. 
Nebraska is an ag State. In 2018, Ne-
braska generated around $21.3 billion in 
agricultural cash receipts. Agriculture 
and ag processing accounts for 9.4 per-
cent of the State’s GDP. The agri-
culture production complex accounts 
for approximately one-quarter of our 
GDP workforce. By these measures, ag-
riculture plays a greater role in my 
State of Nebraska than it does in the 
economy of any other State in the 
United States. When agriculture suf-
fers, Nebraska suffers. 
Over the last several years, our farm-
ers and ranchers have done their fair 
share of suffering. As my colleague 
mentioned, USDA’s most recent farm 
income projections forecast that cash 
receipts will be at their lowest level in 
more than a decade. As a rancher, I 
know it is difficult to plan for the fu-
ture when you are facing so many fac-
tors that are outside of your control, 
whether it is low commodity prices or 
retaliatory tariffs or natural disasters 
that we have gone through and also a 
global pandemic. 
Nebraska’s 
farmers 
and 
ranchers 
have maintained their patience in 
these tough times, but they deserve to 
know without any kind of doubt that 
amidst all of this unpredictability they 
are experiencing, we here in Congress 
are going to hold up our end of the bar-
gain. 
For decades, the Commodity Credit 
Corporation has been routinely replen-
ished to fund the programs that the 
Senator from North Dakota spoke 
about—those programs that are so im-
portant to the farm safety net. Pro-
ducers count on programs like the agri-
culture risk coverage, price loss cov-
erage, marketing assistance loans, the 
important conservation programs, and 
so many more. 
For PLC alone, U.S. farmers are ex-
pected to receive $4.7 billion in Octo-
ber. Out of that total, Nebraska farm-
ers are anticipating $180 million in pro-
gram payments. Without that imme-
diate CCC reimbursement, these pay-
ments and these programs are going to 
be significantly delayed. That will 
jeopardize the nearly 46,000 farms and 
ranches in my State of Nebraska. 
We have seen more than 40 agri-
culture and commodity groups who 
have stepped forward and written con-
gressional leadership this week with a 
very, very clear message: Blocking the 
inclusion of that CCC reimbursement 
in a CR will hurt farmers and ranchers, 
no question. 
We need to come together. We need 
to come together and fund the pro-
grams that we, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, have voted on in countless

farm bills. Our farmers and ranchers 
rely on them, and they rely on them 
now more than ever. Congress must 
keep its commitment to these hard- 
working men and women. 
I urge my colleagues in the House 
and here in the Senate not to allow 
politics to stand in the way of uphold-
ing our commitment to those hard- 
working men and women who get up 
every morning and work tirelessly day 
in and day out to put food on our ta-
bles. Our producers aren’t thinking of 
just themselves; they are planning for 
future generations that will proudly 
carry on their life’s work and continue 
feeding our world. Let’s make sure we 
continue to fund these programs so 
that we can ensure that they can do 
that. 
My thanks to my fellow ag State col-
leagues who know the importance of 
agriculture, not just to the States we 
represent but to this country as a 
whole. Thank you to the Senator from 
North Dakota for organizing us to 
come to the floor so that we as a group 
can stress that importance. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
would like to thank the good Senator 
from Nebraska and turn to the Senator 
from Iowa, who has also been an abso-
lute champion on behalf of agriculture. 
Thanks so much for being here. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Thank you, Senator 
HOEVEN and Senator FISCHER, as well. 
We have so many of our great ag State 
friends here on the floor today to join 
in this colloquy. 
I did grow up on a small family farm 
in Southwest Iowa and grew up around 
hogs. We have row crops, of course, 
coming out of Iowa—soybeans and 
corn, which are very, very important. 
This 
is 
an 
important 
discussion 
today because our farmers need cer-
tainty—I hear it time and again from 
Iowa’s ag community—whether it is 
trade, biofuels, or the supports that are 
coming from USDA. 
Just yesterday, I heard the message 
loud and clear as I was on a phone call 
with our farmers from the Iowa Farm 
Bureau. They said we need to make 
sure the CCC is fully funded. This isn’t 
just because of COVID–19 aid pay-
ments. That is something different. 
Those have been helpful to most of our 
farmers. This is because our farm bill 
programs depend on the CCC being 
funded. The important supports out 
there for dairy, for conservation, for 
young 
and 
beginning 
farmers—you 
name it; it is the CCC. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, USDA 
Secretary Perdue was in Iowa, and we 
toured one of the many conservation 
sites across the State and saw first-
hand the good work that is being done 
with our farmers through USDA’s con-
servation programs. They are working 
to improve their operations while also 
cleaning Iowa’s water, air, and keeping 
our soil healthy. Without these con-
servation programs funded through the 
CCC, this work simply would not be 
happening. 
Folks, since 1987, Congress has re-
plenished the CCC back to $30 billion 
every year. This is not the year to stop. 
Iowa farmers in particular have been 
suffering through COVID–19; plus we 
had a derecho and a drought. The last 
thing we need is to take away some-
thing they have come to depend on. 
Madam President, 2020 has been hard 
on everyone, and there is no time to 
play games with our farmers’ futures. I 
hope our friends on the other side of 
the aisle join us in supporting the re-
plenishment of the CCC in the upcom-
ing funding bill. 
I yield back to Senator HOEVEN, the 
great Senator from North Dakota. 
Again, my thanks to the Senator and 
all of our farm State participants 
today for joining in the colloquy. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank 
the Senator from Iowa. Again, she di-
rectly brings that experience from the 
farm, growing up in agriculture. 
Somebody else who is here represents 
Mississippi, so you can see we are going 
from North Dakota to Mississippi to 
Iowa to Nebraska. This is the whole 
country we are talking about. 
The Senator also is somebody who 
has a long background in agriculture. I 
would like to turn to the good Senator 
from Mississippi. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as 
a former commissioner of agriculture 
in Mississippi, this is so vital and so 
important. In Mississippi, agriculture 
is the No. 1 industry. One in every four 
jobs is related to agriculture. So this is 
very vital for my State. 
With the end of the fiscal year fast 
approaching, we must act to ensure im-
portant agriculture and conservation 
programs administered by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture do not come to a 
screeching halt on October 1. 
The 2018 farm bill, which was sup-
ported by 87 Members of the Senate, 
authorized important safety-net pro-
grams to protect producers against 
sharp price and revenue declines; pro-
vide short-term loans and interim fi-
nancing to help producers meet cash 
flow needs; assist dairy producers af-
fected by low milk prices and high feed 
costs; compensate landowners for tak-
ing fragile land out of production and 
implementing conservation improve-
ments to help the environment; and as-
sist producers when natural disasters 
destroy feed for livestock, cause above- 
average livestock mortality, and dam-
age commercial orchards and fruit 
trees. 
Current law requires many of these 
program payments to be made annu-
ally after October 1, which highlights 
the importance of this matter on this 
day. 
As Congress discusses measures to 
keep the government open and Federal 
programs operating beyond the current 
fiscal year, it is essential for any con-
tinuing resolution to include a provi-
sion allowing the USDA Commodity 
Credit Corporation to continue financ-
ing these programs. Failure to include 
such a provision would pose a serious 
risk to America’s farmers and ranchers 
in these already challenging times. It 
would cause harmful delays in program 
funding and benefits at a time when 
many producers across the country 
simply cannot afford to wait months to 
recover for these losses. 
This issue is not just about sup-
porting American agriculture; it is 
about Congress living up to its prom-
ises. More than 1.7 million producers 
signed contracts for the Agriculture 
Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage 
Programs. Millions of private land-
owners have signed conservation con-
tracts to take their land out of produc-
tion. These are contracts, and the 
terms of those contracts must be met. 
I remind my colleagues that this is 
not a situation to be taken lightly. In 
recent years, America’s farmers and 
ranchers have experienced unfair for-
eign tariffs, depressed prices, cata-
strophic flooding and other natural dis-
asters, market disruptions, and now 
COVID–19. 
I applaud my fellow Republican col-
leagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the Senate Agriculture 
Committee for raising awareness on 
this issue. It is our job to feed this 
country. We need to be allowed to do 
that. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, again, I 
thank Senator HYDE-SMITH
of the 
State of Mississippi. Not only is she a 
strong advocate for our farmers and 
ranchers, but as I say, all of these peo-
ple you are hearing from this morning 
have backgrounds in agriculture. They 
have been out there, and they know 
what they are talking about, as does 
the next Senator, somebody who him-
self has raised cattle—the Senator 
from the good State of Arkansas. 
This documents again that ag touch-
es every region of the country and that 
the people you are hearing from have 
strong ag backgrounds. So, when they 
talk about this issue, they know how 
important it is, and they know that 
this help is very much needed at this 
time. 
I turn to the good Senator from Ar-
kansas, Mr. BOOZMAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank Senator 
HOEVEN and Senator ROBERTS for orga-
nizing this and getting us down here to 
talk about a topic that is so, so very 
important. 
I am not going to say anything new. 
I am going to be saying that we need to 
include reimbursement to the USDA’s 
Commodity Credit Corporation in the 
upcoming continuing resolution. The 
CCC is the funding mechanism for the 
bulk of our Nation’s agriculture and 
conservation programs that are au-
thorized with broad bipartisan support 
in the farm bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5687 
September 17, 2020 
In order for these programs to work 
as intended, the CCC must be reim-
bursed by Congress on an annual basis. 
For decades, the CCC has been reim-
bursed by Congress without fanfare, 
and I am hopeful this year will be a 
continuation. Earlier this year, the 
Senate voted unanimously to allow the 
USDA to use $14 billion from the CCC 
to prevent, prepare for, and respond to 
the coronavirus. This provision was in-
cluded in the CARES Act. 
As our farmers and ranchers face the 
most challenging year in recent his-
tory, we have an obligation to advance 
this provision so the important farm 
and conservation program payments 
are made on time and in full to our 
farmers and ranchers. 
Earlier this week, over 40 agricul-
tural organizations representing farm-
ers and ranchers across the country 
sent a letter to the Appropriations 
Committee, urging this provision be in-
cluded in the continuing resolution. 
Preventing a CCC reimbursement 
would only exacerbate the tremendous 
hardship and challenges facing our 
farmers and ranchers. So I am here 
with so many other members of the 
Senate Ag Committee and Members 
who represent rural States to urge the 
Senate to help farmers and ranchers 
and 
prevent 
the 
uncertainty 
that 
would come from not including this im-
portant provision. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator BOOZMAN for his strong leader-
ship on ag. He said it very well and 
very clearly and very simply. 
We have heard from more than 40 ag 
groups from across the country, includ-
ing from the Presiding Officer’s State. 
The last I checked, he has tremendous 
agriculture in his State of Florida, 
whether it be with the cattle raised in 
Central Florida or those wonderful or-
anges that we all enjoy all year round. 
It is just one more example of how ag-
riculture 
touches 
everybody’s 
life 
every day in the most important ways. 
Our farmers and ranchers feed the 
country. They feed the world. What 
could be more important? Look at the 
challenges they have faced. They have 
come into this cycle with very low 
commodity prices when they have had 
years of low commodity prices. We 
have tough trade agreements in which 
countries like China and others have 
targeted us on trade. Then you put 
COVID on top of that. In the midst of 
that, they have continued to provide 
the food supply that feeds every Amer-
ican every single day. What could be 
more important? As we have said, that 
food supply is the highest quality, low-
est cost food supply in the history of 
the world. Do you know what else? It is 
safe, and they have never missed a 
beat. 
What we are talking about today, 
make no mistake, is of making sure 
that we fund the heart and soul of the 
farm program. The bill passed on a bi-
partisan vote in this body with about 
87 votes. That is what we are talking 
about with regard to funding the CR. It 
is vitally important that we do it. I 
thank these members of the Ag Com-
mittee for making that point so clearly 
and so well. 
We will wrap up, actually, pretty 
close to on time, which is fairly re-
markable as seven Senators have just 
gone through this colloquy process, 
and I thank them all. 
Remember what we are talking about 
here—the food supply that benefits 
every single American every single 
day. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
MEDICARE 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the elec-
tion is only weeks away. Voting has al-
ready begun in some places. I know 
that folks at home in Oregon, where 
some of our communities are literally 
reduced to ashes, are already thinking 
about how they are going to vote. They 
will have a lot on their minds when 
they fill out their ballots, obviously, 
and I hope all Americans will fill out 
their ballots early as a raging pan-
demic and catastrophic fires in Oregon 
and across the West have taken a huge 
toll on our communities. 
What I want to do this morning—and 
I am going to use public records to 
sound an alarm—is talk about another 
issue that isn’t getting nearly the at-
tention it deserves—not even close. A 
Medicare crisis is headed our way and 
fast. Whoever wins the next Presi-
dential election will be in charge dur-
ing the biggest crisis Medicare has ever 
faced. 
Based on these public records, I want 
to warn the public—particularly sen-
iors—about something I believe they 
already know: You cannot trust Donald 
Trump to protect Medicare, so you 
have to protect Medicare from Donald 
Trump. 
Donald Trump has proposed extreme 
budget cuts to Medicare for 3 straight 
years. In 2018, he proposed cutting $500 
billion, and in 2019, more than $800 bil-
lion. In 2020, Donald Trump proposed 
cutting $450 billion from Medicare. The 
Democrats blocked him from making 
those cuts, but in another Presidential 
term, he could undermine Medicare on 
his own. Here is how the situation 
comes to be. 
Our economy melted down earlier 
this 
year 
because 
the 
President 
downplayed the coronavirus. Millions 
were out of work, and businesses shut-
tered—whole sectors of our economy 
mothballed. The economy collapsed. 
Again, I base this on public records. It 
has been devastating to Medicare’s fi-
nances. According to the nonpartisan 
experts in charge of Medicare’s books, 
the Medicare trust fund is going to be 
insolvent within 4 years. 
These funds are essential to Medicare 
as we know it. They pay for basic serv-
ices that millions of seniors need each 
day—treatment for heart attacks and 
strokes, care for a broken bone or a 
bout with the flu that lands an older 
person in the emergency room, and ac-
cess to skilled nursing care. Once you 
reach insolvency, you are sending this 
country’s seniors out into no man’s 
land. 
Whether Medicare is going to con-
tinue to function the way it does today 
is a big unknown. If Donald Trump is 
in a position to be in charge, these 
Trump budgets are going to be the end 
of the Medicare guarantee. Ever since I 
was the director of the Oregon Gray 
Panthers, we had always looked at that 
Medicare guarantee as sacred. It meant 
that there would be defined, secure, 
high-quality health benefits for Amer-
ica’s seniors and that they would be 
available under any type of Medicare 
that older people received. 
Based on some of these Trump budget 
proposals, older Americans are going to 
have to figure out some other way to 
pay for their healthcare and their pre-
scription drugs. That includes the mil-
lions and millions of seniors who have 
very modest incomes—many who are 
just scraping by on Social Security. 
What we know based on the policies of 
Trump’s favoritism for the insurance 
lobby, they could be at the mercy of in-
surance companies and be stuck with 
huge premiums and bills they couldn’t 
afford to pay. 
The reason I wanted to put this into 
the RECORD today and sound this alarm 
is that this is not some far-off crisis 
that Americans and particularly sen-
iors can ignore and can afford to ig-
nore. If you are on Medicare now or if 
you plan on getting on Medicare any-
time soon, these are direct threats to 
your healthcare. Whoever is sitting be-
hind the desk in the Oval Office on 
January 21 is going to be in charge 
when this crisis hits. 
Everybody ought to understand that 
the special interests that want to see 
Medicare crumble will have an advan-
tage this time around. This isn’t like 
repealing the Affordable Care Act or 
slashing Medicaid, where Trump can’t 
act without Congress. If he has his 
way, he won’t need Congress to help 
him undermine Medicare; he would be 
able to just sit back in front of the tel-
evision, forget about his obligation to 
protect that sacred Medicare guar-
antee, and let Medicare just drift into 
a crisis on its own. Any attempt to fix 
it then would have to happen on his 
terms, and, for seniors, good luck with 
that. 
The Trump administration has spent 
years doing the bidding of healthcare’s 
special interests. In my view, there is 
no question they would seize on this 
Medicare crisis as another way to let 
those special interests make a buck, 
and there would be no way for Ameri-
cans to know what kind of financial in-
terests Trump and his cronies would 
have in undermining this program that 
tens of millions of American seniors 
rely on every day. 
Now, if you were the President and 
you were to ask him ‘‘Well, what about

these comments that are being made?’’ 
and you were to ask about the budget 
documents that I have cited today that 
would unravel the Medicare guarantee, 
he would probably tell one of his bold- 
faced whoppers. He would probably say 
he would be the only person who could 
fix Medicare’s challenges and would 
mislead the public about the agenda of 
those of us on this side of the aisle, 
who want to uphold and expand on the 
Medicare guarantee, who want to make 
sure, for example, that there will be af-
fordable medicine for senior citizens, 
that we are using the bargaining power 
of the Federal Government to get sen-
iors a fair shake and are protecting 
Medicaid, which is a lifeline for mil-
lions. We will also unravel the damage 
Donald Trump has done to the Afford-
able Care Act, such as trying to let the 
insurance 
companies 
discriminate 
again against those with preexisting 
conditions. 
The fact is that Donald Trump has 
not been straight with the seniors of 
this country about his Medicare poli-
cies. He hasn’t told the truth about 
them, and in the days ahead, I intend 
to make sure that this truth gets out 
and that seniors really understand 
what is on the line in the weeks ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
JENNA QUINN LAW 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as fami-
lies have been quarantined at home 
over the past several months, their 
lives have been filled with a whole new 
set of stressors. Loss of income, isola-
tion, anxiety about their own health, 
and the stress of teaching children at 
home can test even the healthiest fam-
ilies and relationships. 
But it also puts children at higher 
risk of child abuse and neglect. In April 
this year, nationwide reports of abuse 
or neglect dropped by an average of 
about 40 percent compared to the same 
time last year. That doesn’t mean 
there are fewer instances of abuse— 
probably far from it—just fewer re-
ports. 
One of the things about children at-
tending school is that their teachers 
and counselors can monitor them for 
signs of sexual assault, sexual abuse, 
and report that to the appropriate au-
thorities. In 2018, two-thirds of the re-
ports of child abuse were submitted by 
people who came in contact with treat-
ment as part of their jobs—police offi-
cers, lawyers, social services, and, of 
course, teachers, as I said. 
Teachers, 
education 
professionals, 
and other support staff at school, like 
bus drivers, are responsible for more 
than half of the child abuse reports. 
But with children home during the 
pandemic, out of sight from the teach-
ers and others who would otherwise see 
them on a routine basis, abuse is be-
coming more difficult to identify and 
report. 
Child sexual assault abuse was a cri-
sis before the pandemic, with more 
than 42 million adult survivors in 
America. As the stresses of the pan-
demic and lack of reporting have taken 
a violent toll across the country, there 
is an urgent need for Congress to act. 
Over the years, I have listened to 
courageous victims in Texas who have 
shared their stories and advocated for 
reforms to prevent more children from 
experiencing this tragic abuse. One of 
those inspirational individuals is Jenna 
Quinn, a child abuse survivor and fierce 
advocate for children who are often 
suffering in silence. She was the driv-
ing force behind what is now known as 
Jenna’s Law in Texas, which requires 
training for teachers, caregivers, and 
other adults who work with children on 
how to prevent, recognize, and report 
child sexual abuse. The signs of child 
sexual abuse are unique from other 
forms of child abuse, and correctly 
identifying these signs is integral to 
bringing children out of a sexually abu-
sive situation. 
After it passed in 2009, a study found 
that educators reported child sexual 
abuse at a rate almost four times 
greater after the training they had re-
ceived than before they had received 
that training. It was one of the first 
child sexual abuse prevention laws in 
the United States demanding this 
training, and now more than half of 
our States have adopted some form of 
Jenna’s Law. 
The kicker is that in many States, 
including Texas, they don’t provide 
funding for the training, for the pro-
gram. That is what Senator HASSAN, 
the Senator from New Hampshire, and 
I want to change. 
Last year we introduced the Jenna 
Quinn Law, which would take the suc-
cessful reforms in Texas and other 
States and make them a reality for 
children across the country. This bill 
would allow current grant funds to be 
used for specialized training for stu-
dents, teachers, and other caregivers to 
learn how to identify, safely report, 
and hopefully prevent future child sex-
ual abuse. This legislation also encour-
ages the States without similar laws to 
implement innovative programs to ad-
dress such abuse. 
Again, I want to express my appre-
ciation to Senators HASSAN and BRAUN, 
who have joined me in this bipartisan 
effort, and I hope we can get this bill to 
the President’s desk soon. No child 
should experience abuse or neglect, and 
the Jenna Quinn Law will bring us 
closer to identifying and stopping 
abuse in its tracks. 
I came to the floor initially with the 
thought of offering a unanimous con-
sent request to pass the Jenna Quinn 
Law, Jenna’s Law. It has cleared on 
our side. There is some discussion 
going forward between our Democratic 
colleagues and us about pairing this 
with another piece of legislation which, 
like Jenna’s Law, is not controversial. 
And based on the commitment that 
this will be passed as part of the 
wrapup this evening, I will not offer 
that unanimous consent request at this 
time, but I will depend on that com-
mitment we have gotten that it will be 
passed in wrapup today. So I want to 
express again my appreciation to Sen-
ator HASSAN and Senator BRAUN for 
working with us on this. 
So often, the best of intentions go 
awry because there is no funding mech-
anism to help facilitate and pay for the 
training, and that is where the money 
that we appropriated that goes to the 
Department of Justice—their grant 
programs for various law enforcement 
initiatives—is so valuable. Those are 
the funds that are already appropriated 
that we want to tap into for this type 
of essential training. 
I yield to my friend from New Hamp-
shire. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator CORNYN for his part-
nership and support his call. I urge my 
colleagues to support our legislation, 
the Jenna Quinn Law, and I, too, look 
forward to its being passed as part of 
wrapup this evening. 
Every child has the fundamental 
right to be safe, to be treated with dig-
nity, to be cared for, and to have the 
opportunity to seize their vast poten-
tial. Sexual abuse robs children of 
those rights. Too often, these horrific 
crimes go unrecognized or unreported, 
and children are left in dangerous situ-
ations without access to safety and jus-
tice. 
During my time as Governor of New 
Hampshire, I worked with Republicans 
and Democrats to sign into law a bill 
that mandated that child abuse preven-
tion be taught as a part of the health 
education curriculum, and I am proud 
to work with Senator CORNYN
to 
strengthen these efforts on a national 
level. 
The Jenna Quinn Law would better 
protect children from sexual assault by 
helping ensure that teachers, care-
givers, and other adults working with 
children are equipped with the tools 
and knowledge to prevent, recognize, 
and report sexual abuse and exploi-
tation. It would also ensure that chil-
dren receive age-appropriate education 
on how to recognize and report these 
heinous acts. 
By encouraging States to provide 
training and education on child sexual 
abuse recognition and prevention, we 
can help keep our young people safe. 
But we know that there is much more 
work ahead of us. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is exacer-
bating challenges that many vulner-
able people face, including children 
who are abused, and as reporting of 
abuse has gone down during this pan-
demic, experts have made clear that it 
is because many children have been out 
of view of the people who often provide 
support and make reports, including 
teachers and school officials. 
So as we work to pass the Jenna 
Quinn Law today, we also have to focus 
on passing a broader bipartisan reau-
thorization of the Child Abuse Preven-
tion and Treatment Act to provide

even more tools to support children 
and families who are struggling. It is 
our duty to nurture and protect all of 
our country’s children, and the Jenna 
Quinn Law is a strong step to help 
move us forward in meeting that re-
sponsibility. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation and to work together 
on additional bipartisan measures to 
protect the safety and well-being of 
children across the country. Again, I 
thank my friend from Texas for his 
leadership in moving this important 
bill forward, and I look forward con-
tinuing to work with him on these 
issues.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the cloture 
vote on Calendar No. 816, the nomina-
tion of Franklin Ulyses Valderrama, be 
withdrawn and that the Senate proceed 
to vote on the nomination under the 
previous order at 11:45 a.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered 
The Senator from Michigan. 
AGRICULTURE 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise to talk about what we need to be 
doing certainly to support the farmers 
across our country. I know Republican 
colleagues spoke just a while ago about 
the need to refill what we call the CCC 
to make sure that we are providing the 
funding for the October payments for 
the farm bill. 
As one of the authors of the farm 
bill, I certainly know we have to make 
those payments, and the good news is 
that there is enough money there now 
to do that, although we certainly also 
want to be providing emergency sup-
port, disaster support, for growers who 
have been hit and have had losses as a 
result of the Trump chaotic trade poli-
cies, as a result of what has happened 
under COVID–19. Our farmers have 
been hit every which way, including 
what is happening on climate change 
and the weather, prices, everything 
else, and we certainly want to make 
sure that they have what they need. 
I want to raise two points today. One 
is that in order to do that, the USDA 
should be focusing on a GAO report 
that was released on Monday that indi-
cated and actually reaffirmed a report 
that I released with our Senate Demo-
cratic colleagues on the Agricultural 
Committee that, in fact, the payments 
going out to farmers have not been 
fair. They have been picking winners 
and losers; they have been picking re-
gions in the South, big farms in the 
South, not over the Midwest or our 
smaller farmers and over many of 
those who, frankly, have had the big-
gest losses. 
So when I hear my colleagues talk 
about the fact that we need to be sup-
porting farmers and we need to make 
sure that the farm bill payments go 
out, I absolutely agree that money is 
in there right now to do that. If we are 
going to add other money, I think we 
ought to be paying attention to what 
the GAO has now affirmed, which is we 
should be making sure we are funding 
those with losses—those who need the 
help the most in these chaotic times 
for farmers. 
But something has now come up 
today that is even more alarming to 
me, and that is related to what the 
Trump administration appears to be 
considering right now, which is to take 
at least $300 million in funds, cash aid, 
and give it to U.S. oil refineries out of 
the funds we are talking about—that 
my colleagues just talked about—that 
were supposed to be going to farmers. 
We have had 31⁄2 years of this admin-
istration siding with big oil companies 
over our ethanol producers. And, by 
the way, ethanol biofuels are about 
jobs, about clean energy, and about 
supporting small towns in rural com-
munities. Then, just this week, at the 
very last minute—it is election year— 
they announce that they are going to 
make a decision that will help ethanol 
and be able to deal with some of the 
waivers that they have been doing for 
the oil companies. They announced 
that earlier this week, and then, guess 
what. Through the back door, they are 
going to take—if this is accurate in 
Reuters—$300 million away from our 
farmers to give back to Big Oil. 
Every time we turn around, they are 
deciding to support Big Oil over farm-
ers in our rural communities. I want to 
know from colleagues—I had hoped to 
get to the floor to ask the question di-
rectly, and I am certainly going to ask 
it of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle who I know support ethanol 
and biofuels—when they are advocating 
for more money in the CCC, are they 
advocating for $300 million going to the 
oil companies? Because, oh, heavenly 
days, we couldn’t really side with eth-
anol. 
You know, if we really sided with 
ethanol, they wouldn’t be worried 
about the oil companies who have been 
fighting this every step of the way, 
fighting the efforts to support ethanol 
and biofuels, and fighting the efforts 
that are critical for jobs in rural com-
munities in my State and all across the 
country. If they really meant it, they 
wouldn’t be trying, through the back 
door, to find some way to go back and 
get hundreds of millions of dollars for 
the oil companies so they wouldn’t be 
upset. 
So I find this pretty outrageous 
today. We are certainly going to dig 
deep, and, certainly, we are in the proc-
ess right now of putting together a let-
ter to the USDA. But the reality is 
that over and over again there is a lot 
of lip service for farmers and a lot of 
money going to Big Oil, and there is a 
lot of lip service to small and medium- 
sized farmers across Michigan and 
across the country, while 95 percent of 
these payments that are being done are 
going to big operations with political 
friends in the South. 
It is not fair. It is not fair. It is cre-
ating a situation where too many fam-
ily farms are barely making it or, in 
fact, not making it and having to put 
the farm up for sale, and that is wrong. 
It is not good for America. It is not 
good for diversity in agriculture. We 
don’t need just a few huge farms in 
America. We need to make sure that 
we are supporting our small farmers 
and medium farmers. This is the foun-
dation of so much of the economy in 
small towns like where I grew up in 
Northern Michigan. 
What we have seen is an administra-
tion that has chosen to basically throw 
the farm bill out the window. My col-
leagues talked about the great bipar-
tisan farm bill. I agree. As the partner 
with Senator ROBERTS in putting that 
together, I agree. It was a great bipar-
tisan effort that the USDA has basi-
cally torn up and thrown out the win-
dow, and instead of creating markets 
for our farmers and supporting them 
with risk management, now it is back 
to big government payments. By the 
way, let’s make sure they are focused 
on our friends. That is basically what 
the report from the GAO has shown us. 
I am very concerned that one more 
time there is a lot of lip service for 
farmers, and we are going to see—and 
we are certainly going to stop this, by 
the way—$300 million going to oil com-
panies out of our agriculture support 
fund. It is stunning to me. 
By the way, I would just conclude by 
saying that the Secretary of Agri-
culture has said he didn’t have the au-
thority to help the ethanol producers, 
couldn’t 
help 
our 
corn 
growers, 
couldn’t help our biofuel and soybeans 
growers—he didn’t have the authority. 
He didn’t have the authority to help 
our farmers, but somehow he has the 
authority to dip into agriculture sup-
port funds to be able to fund $300 mil-
lion to Big Oil. This is wrong. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle who were here speak-
ing earlier about the importance of 
supporting agriculture will join us in 
saying to the USDA: You do not have 
the authority to use dollars for pro-
ducers that have been hit so hard by 
the chaos of their trade policies and 
every other effort that has gone on in 
the real world that has lowered their 
prices and created havoc for our farm-
ers. You don’t have the right to take 
their funds and give them to Big Oil. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Nevada. 
WILDFIRES 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today to talk about what we are 
seeing in this country in the West with 
the horrific wildfires that are hap-
pening right now. I have to say, so 
many of my colleagues have been 
speaking out, and rightfully so. My 
heart, along with all of theirs, goes out 
to everyone who has been affected by 
the fires raging across the West and, 
most of all, to those who have lost 
members of their families or their 
homes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5690 
September 17, 2020 
You know, I am thinking of the hun-
dreds of thousands of people in Oregon 
under evacuation orders, of the brave 
firefighters in California who are bat-
tling flames in the middle of a pan-
demic, of Nevadans whose skies are 
blanketed with hazardous smoke—ev-
eryone in the West who is pooling all of 
their efforts and resources to support 
one another from Washington to Or-
egon, to California, to Nevada—every-
where that we have seen. 
I also want to honor the efforts of 
two courageous pilots who died in a 
crash over Caliente, NV, in July while 
dropping fire retardant on the Bishop 
Fire. David Blake Haynes and Scott 
Thomas lost their lives while pro-
tecting the people of Nevada, and I join 
all Nevadans in sharing my condo-
lences with their families. 
You know, Americans are up against 
the brutal reality of the climate crisis. 
Science tells us that climate change is 
making the West hotter and drier and 
contributing to wildfires. Scientists 
have been sending a consistent message 
about climate change for the past 30 
years. In the entire Western United 
States, we have seen just some of the 
dire effects scientists have predicted. 
That is why we need Federal action to 
slow the very clear effects of climate 
change. 
We have seen those effects in my 
home State of Nevada where, this year 
alone, almost a quarter million acres 
have burned so far. Since I have been in 
the Senate, over 21⁄2 million acres in 
Nevada have burned in tragedies like 
the Poeville Fire, the South Sugarloaf 
Fire, the Range 2 Fire, and the Martin 
Fire, which was the State’s largest fire 
in our country. That is why the entire 
Nevada delegation has worked so hard 
to get Nevada the resources it needs to 
prepare for these fires, combat them 
when they occur, and rebuild after-
ward. 
We have helped get funds to the Uni-
versity 
of 
Nevada, 
Reno, 
for 
its 
ALERTWildfire Program, which uses 
state-of-the-art cameras to monitor 
the fires. We have requested that the 
Nevada Air National Guard get the 
tools it needs to combat these fires, in-
cluding C–130J aircraft that could fight 
fires 
all 
over 
the 
West. 
Yet, 
inexplicably, this request was turned 
down earlier this year. 
Along with my colleagues in the Sen-
ate, we have worked to pass a bill to 
create a permanent Forest Service con-
tingency account so that Federal agen-
cies aren’t left empty-handed when 
they need the money the most. 
Last summer, I convened the first of 
its kind wildfire summit in Nevada. I 
was honored to join our firefighters, 
our ranchers, our conservationists, our 
scientists, our power companies, and 
representatives of government agencies 
in thinking through new ways to co-
ordinate and collaborate around how to 
address these wildfires. 
There is so much that we can do 
working together—from developing in-
novative digital platforms to monitor 
the fire to funding research, to restor-
ing native plants, to helping neighbor-
hoods plan for and adapt to fire sea-
sons. We need to make our farms and 
landscapes more resilient. We need to 
preserve our national treasures and im-
prove the health and well-being of 
those who live in our cities and rural 
areas alike because the truth is that it 
is not getting cooler. 
Anyone in Los Angeles, which saw 
temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit 
this month, or in Las Vegas, which hit 
113 degrees in July, can tell you that. 
Taking climate seriously shouldn’t be 
a partisan issue. This is about safe-
guarding property, protecting local 
economies, and saving lives—lives of 
first responders who have too much to 
do with too few resources and lives of 
civilians throughout Nevada and the 
West frightened by what they are see-
ing literally in their backyards. 
So I plan to listen to what the sci-
entists are telling us. I am listening to 
Nevadans in places like Winnemucca 
and Elko, where ranchers and local of-
ficials have lived through these fires. I 
am listening to Nevada’s Tribal lead-
ers, whose people have been stewards of 
the land for millennia, and to other 
communities of color that are among 
the hardest hit when disaster strikes. 
And, yes, I am listening to my col-
leagues who have devastating stories of 
what is happening to their own con-
stituents in their States right now. 
The climate crisis is all around us— 
from the wildfires we are seeing in the 
West to the hurricanes we are seeing 
right now in the South. It is time for 
us to take bipartisan action, address 
the climate crisis, and make sure we 
are doing what we do best: funding 
short-term and long-term policies and 
goals to address these issues. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues around the States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5691 
September 17, 2020 
Unfortunately, Congressional Demo-
crats have decided not to let the oppor-
tunity that moment presents go to 
waste. Democrats are taking advantage 
of the American people’s uncertainty 
and pain in an attempt to force them 
to lose faith in their government, in 
their fellow countrymen, and in them-
selves. We are hearing from people that 
this causes them concern because they 
want to see us work together; they 
want to see us address these issues that 
are causing heartache together. 
I have to tell you, I think it was so 
unfortunate that last week, some of 
our friends across the aisle blocked yet 
another targeted relief package that 
would have brought billions of dollars 
in support to the American people. I 
think we have to realize that this was 
not a vote on final passage; this was a 
vote to end cloture and begin the de-
bate on that package. 
Basically, what our friends across the 
aisle said to the American people last 
week is this: We don’t want to talk 
about this. We don’t want to discuss it. 
We don’t want to debate it. 
That is unfortunate. If you look at 
the bill that the Senate Republicans 
proposed and brought forward on a clo-
ture vote last week, it is hard to tease 
out exactly what the problem was with 
it. It included another round of pay-
check protection plan funding. I will 
tell you, in Tennessee, a lot of our en-
tertainment venues and a lot of our 
restaurants need this. They need that 
consideration to stay afloat. 
There was funding for vaccine devel-
opment. Is there anybody who does not 
think 
we 
need 
a 
vaccine 
for 
coronavirus? I haven’t met people who 
think we don’t need to be working on 
that. Everybody is saying: Let’s get 
this to market as safely and quickly as 
is possible. 
There was support for healthcare 
workers. 
There was support for students and 
teachers who are still trying to adapt 
to online learning. 
I was just doing a virtual townhall 
with one of our counties in Tennessee. 
One of their issues is, when will there 
be additional funding to help us with 
technology, because 30 percent of our 
students elected an e-learning format. 
Do you know what? There was even 
money for the post office. Back in Au-
gust, our friends across the aisle 
thought that was a crisis, but I guess it 
was their drama of the day because 
they voted against all of this funding. 
They voted for weakening the econ-
omy, I guess, and they voted against 
the prospects of American workers. 
But 
what 
they 
were 
doing 
was 
strengthening the false premise that 
they are the only ones capable of 
sparking an economic recovery. This, 
of course, is demonstrably false. 
This week, the Census Bureau re-
leased its annual report. I will tell you 
that the numbers prove that the Trump 
administration’s 
pro-growth 
policies 
are working. The Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act that we passed in 2017 is working. 
It has spurred economic growth. It has 
spurred an economy like I have never 
seen in my lifetime. 
In 2019, incomes grew at the highest 
pace ever recorded. Last year, the offi-
cial poverty rate fell to an all-time 
record low of 10.5 percent. Think about 
that—10.5 percent. A decade ago, there 
were more people than ever on assist-
ance. Between 2018 and 2019 alone, more 
than 4 million Americans rose out of 
poverty. Think about those numbers. 
That is a good thing. It was the largest 
reduction in poverty in over 50 years. 
The Black poverty rate fell below 20 
percent for the first time in history, 
and child poverty also fell to a near 50- 
year low. 
Our record on this is very clear: The 
Trump administration policies worked. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked. 
That is what the American people are 
wanting to get back to. 
I encourage all of my colleagues in 
this Chamber to read that report and 
look at these stats, and everyone 
should 
remind 
themselves 
of 
the 
progress we have made as a nation on 
growing this economy over the last 4 
years. 
Politically, everybody talks about 
how this is a divided nation, but we 
have to come together and work under 
an umbrella of policies that will make 
life better for all Americans. For the 
life of me, I cannot fathom why my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
would throw that opportunity away. 
Our citizens want us to work on a re-
lief package that is going to help them 
get back to work, help our children get 
back to school, and allow our commu-
nities, our schools, our governments, 
and our businesses to safely operate 
with liability protections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
TRANSPORTATION 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to talk 
about the importance of aviation and 
continuing to focus on the workforce 
employed in aviation. I want to speak 
about the importance of the thousands 
of workers, including pilots, flight at-
tendants, gate agents, baggage han-
dlers, mechanics, catering workers, and 
many others, who are feeling the im-
pact of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I believe we should continue to ad-
dress the very important issues of the 
health aspects of the pandemic and the 
economic impact of the pandemic, but 
while we are working on developing a 
vaccine and developing better thera-
peutics and testing and stopping the 
spread of this virus, we also need to 
keep in mind that we do need transpor-
tation. 
Prior to the pandemic, the aviation 
industry supported nearly 11 million 
American jobs, put $1.8 trillion to work 
in our economy, and contributed to 
about 5.2 percent of our GDP. In fact, 
civilian aviation is the seventh leading 
contributor of overall productivity. 
These are skilled, high-wage jobs that 
are critical to our economy that can-
not be easily replaced. Maintaining our 
aviation sector is vital to the long- 
term economic success of our country. 
When the pandemic hit, we saw a 96- 
percent drop in air travel, which in-
stantly jeopardized thousands of jobs 
in this sector. We worked very hard in 
the CARES Act to create the right bal-
ance of capital for the aviation sector 
to continue because it is essential. We 
also have workers who are essential to 
their jobs, so we must keep moving to 
solve these problems from the pan-
demic. 
The Payroll Support Program, which 
was created in the CARES Act and is 
being administered through the De-
partment of the Treasury, was designed 
to compensate aviation industry work-
ers and preserve jobs in order to help 
protect the essential aspects of avia-
tion and airline services. The program 
continues to cover the costs of keeping 
people employed and keeping this vital 
piece of transportation moving. This is 
critically important because, in just a 
very short period of time, September 
30, this program is going to expire. 
Congress needs to act to extend the 
program. It is important that we pro-
vide this support through the PSP pro-
gram for the aviation workers who are 
so essential to continuing to deliver 
these services. Aviation not only helps 
people move around the country for 
personal reasons and essential business 
reasons, but it also delivers good medi-
cine and essential mail services. The 
fact is that most people probably have 
forgotten how important airlines are to 
delivering the U.S. mail, but they are 
important. 
The CARES Act included require-
ments to ensure that smaller markets 
continue to receive air service and its 
associated benefits. As you can see, 
many of the airlines, in the uncer-
tainty of what is happening with the 
CARES Act extension, are now cutting 
services to those communities. Doing 
another CARES Act bill would help us 
to keep those services in these smaller 
communities. It was announced that as 
many as 50,000 airline jobs will be at 
risk if we don’t continue the Payroll 
Support Program. 
Now is not the time to be uncertain. 
Now is the time to give the airline sec-
tor the importance that it deserves by 
having airline workers continue to do 
their jobs. Every job lost means a 
worker earns less. It means the slow-
down of the economy as a whole. It 
means that consumer spending, which 
is a big engine of our economy, will 
slow down, and 70 percent of our GDP 
comes from that consumer spending. 
So these programs are important. 
If the Payroll Support Program is 
not extended, the cost for workers who 
will lose their jobs will simply be shift-
ed to the States in the form of unem-
ployment benefits, and since we aren’t 
solving the problems of the States, the 
States also add to the GDP, so we are 
not helping the GDP unless we come to 
a resolution within the CARES Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5692 
September 17, 2020 
Unemployment doesn’t cover the cost 
of a full salary. Each worker would 
have less to spend on gas and groceries, 
on a mortgage, and on medicine. In the 
downturn of the economy that we have 
been facing, we can’t afford more loss. 
Our economy is showing some signs 
of modest recovery as the result of the 
economic stimulus from the CARES 
Act, but many of those benefits are ex-
piring. I can tell you, as a Member 
from the Pacific Northwest, I hear a 
lot from businesses that didn’t get help 
and support in the PPP program and 
want it to continue so that they, too, 
can be on par with some of their 
friends and neighbors who have been 
able to succeed economically. 
Right now, we are at a turning point 
at which we need the PSP program to 
continue and to help give certainty 
about transportation. Nationally, on 
average, we know an aviation me-
chanic takes home about $1,600 per 
week in pay, but when these jobs are 
cut, the weekly incomes are cut. Let’s 
look at a few States and a few exam-
ples. 
Right now, in North Carolina, the 
weekly income for a mechanic is only 
$350 a week in unemployment benefits, 
and that worker is facing a 79-percent 
cut in weekly income. So I ask our col-
leagues to consider, as you think about 
shifting these transportation workers 
from these salaries that they are get-
ting now to unemployment benefits, 
how dramatic these cuts will be in 
some of these States. 
I am proud that I come from a State 
in which we have a pretty robust un-
employment benefit. I thank our State 
and the people who vote for and sup-
port a robust unemployment benefit, 
but if we continue to not act on the 
CARES Act and the PPP, we will be 
sending people home to States with un-
employment benefits that will be much 
less robust than in my State. Right 
now, to face a 79-percent cut in one’s 
weekly income I don’t think is good for 
the aviation sector. 
On average, when you look at the 
weekly income for ramp agents in 
Georgia, it is about $850, but now that 
any additional weekly benefits have 
run out, these workers face a 57-per-
cent income cut. In State after State, 
we see these cuts in these weekly in-
comes. This means, as I said, less 
money to spend on groceries and less 
money to spend on essentials at home. 
Without any additional weekly bene-
fits, in Florida, pilots will see a 92-per-
cent drop in income, flight attendants 
a 75-percent drop, mechanics an 83-per-
cent drop, and ramp agents a 68-per-
cent drop. In Texas, pilots will see an 
85-percent drop in weekly income, 
flight attendants a 52-percent drop, me-
chanics a 68-percent drop, and ramp 
agents a 48-percent drop. 
My point here is to think about the 
need for us to continue this program in 
that not all States are going to be 
treated equally in how aviation work-
ers will be affected. We have to think 
about how we are going to keep that 
important air travel moving for our 
economy. 
Without the extension, flight crews, 
flight attendants, and others will be 
impacted in another way, in that, when 
you stop air transportation services, 
people, after a period of time, will have 
to come back and be retrained and re-
certified. Many times here, I have par-
ticipated in debates about tax credits 
or tax policy. Oftentimes, we go past 
our deadline of December 31 and into 
the new year. Even though we can’t 
reach a conclusion, most people think: 
Well, that is OK. We will make it retro-
active, so going past our deadline 
doesn’t impact anything. In this case, 
it does impact something because, once 
we hit the October 1 deadline and we 
start seeing these people in unemploy-
ment situations, the time starts tick-
ing for the cost of recertifying them to 
be in that cockpit or to be of service. 
For example, pilots have to meet cer-
tain flying requirements to maintain 
currency in their pilot licenses. So, 
without an extension of the PSP, flight 
crews and flight attendants would need 
to be retrained at the cost of starting 
up again. A PSP extension also means 
supporting their wages and making 
sure 
that 
they 
have 
available 
healthcare during this time period. 
I don’t want to see one more Amer-
ican lose one’s healthcare benefits be-
cause of COVID. We are in a COVID cri-
sis. We want people to be covered with 
healthcare so that we can help to fight 
this pandemic. I know people here in 
Congress are looking at the very short 
time period that we have left before 
September 30. I call on my colleagues 
to set aside our differences and come 
back to the table and make sure that 
we address these issues before this 
major layoff. 
This is important because, as I said, 
this affects the GDP of our country. We 
still have an opportunity to sustain 
950,000 
frontline 
aviation 
workers, 
which is important to helping our 
economy recover. As I said, it is impor-
tant because aviation helps to grow op-
portunities for the future. 
My colleague Senator SCOTT and I 
will tomorrow be announcing other 
aviation legislation that we, too, think 
will help the aviation sector. For every 
10 percent of travel that returns to 
aviation, it drives more than $1.5 bil-
lion into our economy. Those are sala-
ries and wages and other aspects of this 
sector. That is the economic impact 
that we will have by returning flight 
service. 
The original premise around the 
COVID bill was for us not to decimate 
the airline industry so much, because 
of the COVID impact, that it wouldn’t 
recover and so that we wouldn’t be 
there to retrain and take advantage of 
the upside as the public responds. We 
have now gone from that 95-percent 
loss of travel to, right before the Labor 
Day weekend, about 40 percent of air-
line capacity and travel. We want to 
continue being ready to serve the pub-
lic who has to fly, and we want to 
make sure it is safe for the public to 
fly. Getting this extension of the 
COVID bill done before September 30 
still remains a key priority. 
On the point of aviation, I would say 
to my colleagues, besides the Cantwell- 
Scott bill we will be dropping tomor-
row to help focus on more aviation 
safety, my colleague Senator WICKER 
and I remain committed to continuing 
to work on aviation safety as it relates 
to certification legislation. I hope all 
of our colleagues on the Commerce 
Committee will continue to focus on 
that as well. 
WILDFIRES 
Madam President, I would now like 
to say a few words about another press-
ing issue in the State of Washington, 
and that is the issue of fire. 
Yesterday, we heard from the Deputy 
Forest Chief that we needed 5,000 fire-
fighters in the United States to help 
fight fires. It is clear that we don’t 
have 
5,000 
firefighters 
helping 
as 
COVID has impacted our ability to 
fight fire. So I call on the President to 
help us reach out to the international 
community to help us get more fire-
fighters into the United States. 
While Washington and Oregon may 
eventually see wetter weather in Octo-
ber, we still have massive fires that we 
are going to see in California in the 
month of October. We need to get more 
firefighters into the United States to 
help us fight this incredible attack by 
Mother Nature on our communities. 
We can’t leave them defenseless. We 
need to give them a frontline in the de-
fense, so I call on the President to help 
us get more international support for 
fighting fires in the United States of 
America. 
Additionally, I will be supporting my 
colleague 
Senator 
WYDEN’s 
efforts 
today on prescribed burns and the abil-
ity to change our policies and do pre-
scribed burns at different times of the 
year, which is to say burn some of the 
fuel that we think could become fire 
breaks and stop fires from becoming 
larger and larger. The fuel break helps 
to create a line of defense. We sup-
ported this legislation several years 
ago. Unfortunately, it didn’t make it 
into the big fire fix bill when we 
stopped fire borrowing. Nonetheless, it 
remains a big priority. 
What we have come to learn now is 
that trying to do prescribed burns in 
the summer months, when you have 
clearer air, doesn’t really help—it is 
not helping us because we have such 
large-scale 
fires 
and 
these 
very 
unhealthy smoke events that last for 
days and days. Now, thanks to the new 
fire forecasting models that we have 
and the new fire forecasters that we 
put in the previous bill, we are now 
seeing how unhealthy those conditions 
really are. They are so unhealthy that 
they are cause of major concern for 
health officials across the whole West. 
So what do we need to do now? 
We need to pass this proposal that I 
support, along with my colleague Sen-
ator WYDEN, to move prescribed burns

to other parts of the year. Yes, will it 
create a few smoky days here or there 
during parts of our year? Yes, but it 
will help us to better fight these fires 
when it comes to these very hot, dry 
climates that we are now seeing with 
greater frequency in the Pacific North-
west and throughout the West. 
It is time for us to take dramatic ac-
tion in responding to these fires. We 
have taken action, but now we need to 
use these tools that are right in front 
of us today. Get more firefighters and 
get the prescribed burn policies and 
move forward with protecting some of 
our 
most 
vulnerable 
communities 
throughout the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1135 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
am going to be talking about a bill of 
mine that is, I think, very appropriate 
and very timely, the Protect Our He-
roes Act, which will federalize certain 
violent crimes against public safety of-
ficers across the country, like the po-
lice and first responders, in order to 
deter these kinds of crimes and show 
the men and women in our law enforce-
ment community that we have their 
backs. 
Before I get into the details of my 
bill, I want to talk a little bit about a 
very moving event. 
I was back home last week in Alaska. 
I was at the American Legion Post No. 
15 in Palmer, AK, and it was on the 
commemoration of September 11. It 
was a wonderful remembrance dinner. 
There were tons of veterans, patriots. 
My State is blessed with more vets per 
capita than any State in the country. 
But it was focused on law enforce-
ment. We had the Palmer police chief 
there. We had members of the police 
department from Anchorage there be-
cause we were focused on so many 
things that came out of that day—9/11. 
But honoring our first responders is 
something 
that 
I 
think 
America 
learned—that we need to respect the 
men and women epitomized by the po-
lice and firemen who went up the 
Tower. Many of them knew they were 
going to die, and they did that. They 
did that to protect us, and there was 
this newfound respect for our first re-
sponders that came out of the tragedy 
of 9/11. 
Now, in my remarks to my fellow 
veterans in Palmer at the American 
Legion post last Friday, I did mention 
that one of the elements of what is 
happening in our country, unfortu-
nately, is that these memories are fad-
ing. They are fading, and in some ways 
the respect for the police is not just 
fading. It is being reversed. 
You see these movements, these na-
tional movements of defunding our po-
lice—a horrible idea, in my view. My 
State needs more law enforcement, not 
less. We have seen on our TV screens 
and our social media channels that 
there are people—criminals—who are 
focused on harming the police, killing 
the police, attacking the police, and 
even taking glee in the killing and the 
violence against law enforcement. 
So we have all seen in the past few 
years a dramatic increase in killings, 
in ambushes. In Iowa, New York, Mas-
sachusetts, Texas, California, Colorado, 
Pennsylvania, and Georgia this has 
been happening. It certainly hit home 
in my State. 
In Anchorage, in 2016, we had a brave 
police officer, Arn Salao, who was the 
victim of a cowardly ambush in 2016. 
Thankfully, he survived, barely. What 
was the result of the arrest of the indi-
vidual who tried to kill him? He ended 
up being a serial killer, killing five 
others in Anchorage. But this brave po-
lice officer found him, stopped him, 
and almost lost his life. 
Unfortunately, another officer in a 
shooting in Alaska the same year, 2016, 
in Fairbanks, wasn’t so fortunate. On 
October 
16, 
2016, 
Sergeant 
Allen 
Brandt, an 11-year veteran of the Fair-
banks Police Department, pulled over a 
suspect to question him, and he was 
shot five times. He eventually suc-
cumbed to the complications related to 
his injuries. 
I went to the memorial service. 
There were hundreds of Alaskans. He 
had a young family, a young wife. It 
was brutal to watch this. 
These are selfless men and women in 
my State, who are every day getting up 
to risk their lives and to wear the uni-
form in the line of duty. 
All of this inspired me to put to-
gether my Protect Our Heroes Act, 
which will enhance Federal penalties 
for the killing or assaulting of public 
safety officers and first responders, es-
pecially increasing penalties for crimi-
nals who ambush or lure law enforce-
ment officers for the purpose of com-
mitting crimes against them—dramati-
cally enhancing penalties. 
This is something that I think the 
vast majority of us in the Senate agree 
with. 
Now, I take the opportunity to go 
running most days, whether I am here 
or back home. And when I go running 
on Capitol Hill, what I see every morn-
ing—and I saw it this morning—are po-
lice officers. No matter the time of 
day, Capitol Police are sitting in their 
vehicles or on patrol. Their sole pur-
pose is to protect this institution and 
the Members. 
This morning, as I usually do when I 
run past them sitting in their car, I 
just gave them a thumbs-up. Thank 
you. Thank you. We respect you, and 
we certainly have your back. 
So that is why I am offering this leg-
islation today. I hope my Senate col-
leagues can come together to support 
this. I think it would be inconceivable 
to vote against this bill, especially now 
when we are seeing these kinds of hei-
nous activities like we saw in Comp-
ton, CA. But we also want to send a 
message to our first responders and law 
enforcement: We are watching. We are 
going to pass laws to disincentivize 
this kind of heinous action against 
you, and we have your back and the 
back of your family members, who are 
probably worried when you go out on 
your duty every day. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 1135 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
Sullivan substitute amendment at the 
desk be considered and agreed to; that 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Is there objection? 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank 
you for the recognition. 
Mr. President, I reserve my right to 
object. 
As a former assistant U.S. attorney 
and New Mexico attorney general, I 
worked 
hard 
to 
prosecute 
violent 
crimes, 
including 
those 
committed 
against law enforcement. 
The recent shootings of two law en-
forcement officers in California were 
heinous. My deepest condolences and 
prayers go out to the officers and their 
families. The perpetrator must be 
brought to justice. All such violence is 
appalling. 
However, this bill is both unneces-
sary and, potentially, a problematic ex-
pansion of Federal criminal law. It is 
already a Federal crime to kill or at-
tempt to kill an officer or employee of 
the United States. 
Most, if not all, States already make 
killing a police officer a specific crime, 
and, of course, murder and assault are 
crimes in all 50 States and Territories. 
So it is unclear that this bill will in-
crease deterrence, and the bill is very 
broad, covering not only murder and 
attempted murder but also any assault 
against hundreds of thousands or per-
haps millions of people. 
One new crime created by the bill is 
death eligible, raising historic con-
cerns about executing the innocent and 
the death penalty being arbitrarily ap-
plied. 
This bill has not gone through the 
regular order, with no hearings on such 
a sweeping change in the balance of 
State and Federal criminal law. 
For many years, the Heritage Foun-
dation, the Hoover Institution, the 
Federalist Society, and congressional 
Republicans 
have 
all 
spoken 
out 
against the expansion of Federal crimi-
nal law. It is not just conservatives. 
There is bipartisan support for that 
view and broad consensus among crimi-
nal law experts and the Federal judici-
ary itself. 
The Judicial Conference of the U.S. 
courts has testified to Congress against 
the over-criminalization of Federal 
law, citing the burdens they already 
face.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5694 
September 17, 2020 
And former Reagan Attorney General 
Ed Meese wrote for the Hoover Institu-
tion over 20 years ago, in 1999, high-
lighting the following problems with 
over-criminalization of Federal law. He 
warned about these: 
An unwise allocation of scarce resources 
needed to meet the genuine issues of crime; 
An unhealthy concentration of policing 
power at the national level; 
An adverse impact on the federal judicial 
system; 
Inappropriately disparate results for simi-
larly situated defendants, depending on 
whether essentially similar conduct is se-
lected for federal or state prosecution; 
A diversion of congressional attention 
from criminal activity that only federal in-
vestigation and prosecution can address; 
The potential for duplicative prosecutions 
at the state and federal levels for the same 
course of conduct, in violation of the spirit 
of the Constitution’s double jeopardy protec-
tion. 
I think the Senate should consider 
those warnings and should not rush to 
approve such a measure without hear-
ing testimony and a long and careful 
study. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2843 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I would 
like to take this opportunity to call at-
tention to key legislation that address-
es violence, and this piece of legisla-
tion should come to the floor. That is 
the Violence Against Women Reauthor-
ization Act. 
VAWA reauthorization expired over a 
year and a half ago, on February 15, 
2019. Funding continues, but key im-
provements are being delayed by the 
lack of reauthorization. 
The Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2019 is supported by 
all 47 Democratic Senators. The House 
passed the bill 236 to 158. Thirty-three 
House Republicans voted yes on that 
bill. 
The bill would extend VAWA for 5 
years, through 2024, while making key 
improvements. 
As the vice chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, I know 
how critical VAWA reauthorization is 
to Indian Country. 
Data from the U.S. Department of 
Justice indicates that Native women 
face murder rates that are more than 
10 times the national average murder 
rate. There are more than 5,000 cases of 
missing American Indian and Alaska 
Native women, and 55 percent of Native 
women have experienced domestic vio-
lence. More than four in five American 
Indian and Alaska Native women expe-
rience violence in their lifetime. 
Without the enactment of a VAWA 
reauthorization, these Tribes will lack 
the jurisdictional tools they need to 
keep their communities safe. 
The House-passed bill strengthens 
Tribal sovereignty, provides important 
protections for LGBT people, and bars 
dating partners convicted of domestic 
violence from having handguns. 
The bill would make a real difference 
in preventing violent crimes against 
women and making Native commu-
nities safer, and I ask that the Senate 
take up its consideration immediately. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Judiciary 
Committee be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 2843, the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act, 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I have to say 
this sounds a lot like yet another at-
tempt to just change the subject and 
obfuscate. 
I was on this floor earlier this week. 
The Senator from Alaska has just spo-
ken about his goal here. Both of us 
have slightly different approaches to 
try to achieve the same thing, which is 
to discourage these attacks on law en-
forcement officials. 
It seems like almost every day we 
read about some horrific attack on 
men and women across the country 
just because they are police. It is abso-
lutely appalling, and we are trying to 
do everything we can to discourage 
that, to create disincentives, and to 
make sure that violent criminals know 
that they will pay a very steep price if 
they commit the appalling kinds of 
acts that we have seen. 
I commend the Senator from Alaska 
for an approach to this. Yet, again, our 
Democratic colleagues refuse to sup-
port this effort and instead say: Let’s 
change the subject to VAWA. 
Well, let’s talk a little bit about 
VAWA. Look, there is a very real prob-
lem with violence against women. I 
don’t know anyone who would dispute 
that. And VAWA, the legislation, has a 
number of programs, some of which are 
very constructive. 
I voted in favor of the last reauthor-
ization of VAWA because I do think it 
is that important, and I have led the 
effort in this body to ensure that crime 
victims—very much including women— 
get the resources they are supposed to 
get from the Crime Victims Fund, 
which they historically have not been. 
But the fact is, it is a big bill, it is a 
complicated bill, and there are mul-
tiple programs, and some of it is very 
controversial. 
So the way we have actually gotten 
an outcome and achieved something 
with VAWA is through a bipartisan 
process. That is what was done in the 
past, and that effort has been under-
way. Senator ERNST, working with 
Senator FEINSTEIN, has tried to find 
common ground. I think they are not 
quite there yet. But this legislation is 
not that bill. It is not that effort. 
This is a bill that our Democratic 
colleagues have declared they know 
has no chance of actually passing. So 
rather than changing the subject and 
putting forward a bill that everybody 
knows can’t pass, I wish our Demo-
cratic colleagues would join me and my 
colleague from Alaska in doing some-
thing we can do, something modest but 
constructive that would help to dimin-
ish the risks that our law enforcement 
folks take every single day. So, Mr. 
President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleague from 
Pennsylvania. I know he and I both 
share a passion on this issue. I think 
the vast majority of the Senators share 
a passion on this issue—that we should 
be standing here in the U.S. Senate to 
make sure our law enforcement knows 
that we have their backs. 
As Senator TOOMEY just mentioned, 
this is happening all across the coun-
try. The men and women who put on 
the uniform to protect us are being tar-
geted simply because they wear the 
uniform to protect us. If this is not an 
issue that cries out for some kind of 
action, some kind of discussion to pre-
vent this and tell these brave men and 
women, whether in Alaska or Pennsyl-
vania or New Mexico, that we have 
their backs, I don’t know what that 
topic is—I don’t know what that issue 
is. 
Unfortunately, Senator TOOMEY tried 
to move his legislation the last couple 
of days, and it was thwarted. Now my 
legislation to send the message that we 
are not going to let criminals get away 
with these kinds of heinous crimes, 
that the Senate is watching, and that 
we have the backs of law enforcement 
and their families—that is a really im-
portant message to send right now. 
I am disappointed in my colleague 
for objecting. We will continue to work 
on this issue and, as Senator TOOMEY 
mentioned, the violence issue, which is 
a hugely important issue in my State 
for my constituents. But right now, I 
think we should be acting on the issue 
we are seeing, and that issue is, there 
is a movement across the country that 
is really focused on perpetrating vio-
lence against the men and women who 
are sworn to protect us. I can’t believe 
anyone here thinks that is a good 
movement, but it is happening in 
America right now. We need to send a 
message that it is unacceptable and 
that we are going to do everything in 
our power to stop it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
the 
vote 
scheduled for 1:30 p.m. be allowed to 
start at this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Johnston nomi-
nation? 
Mr. ROUNDS. I ask for the yeas and 
nays.

ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, a few 
days ago, Flight 971 took off from Tel 
Aviv Airport. You may say: Of course 
the flight took off from Tel Aviv; that 
happens every day—but not like this 
flight. You see, Flight 971 took off from 
Tel Aviv Airport, flew south, directly 
over Saudi Arabia, which hasn’t hap-
pened, and landed in Abu Dhabi be-
cause the United Arab Emirates has 
formed a peace agreement with Israel— 
recognizing its right to exist, opening 
up Embassies in Israel and in the 
United Arab Emirates, beginning trade 
in commerce. Just days ago, the first 
cargo aircraft took off and flew, taking 
supplies, 
technology, 
medicine—en-
gagement between the Nation of Israel 
and the Arab nation of the United Arab 
Emirates, forming a new alliance in 
the Middle East. 
Flight 971 is significant because 971 is 
the country code if you are going to 
call the United Arab Emirates. The re-
turn flight, by the way, leaving from 
Abu Dhabi and flying back to Israel is 
Flight 972—the country code for Israel. 
That first flight that took off, on the 
outside of the plane were emblazoned 
three words—one in English, one in He-
brew, and one in Arabic—all trans-
lated, the word ‘‘peace.’’ 
It is a new day. And this week, when 
President Trump and the Foreign Min-
isters from the United Arab Emirates 
and from Bahrain and the Prime Min-
ister of Israel all stood at the White 
House and spoke of each other in a new 
partnership and then all sat at a table 
and signed documents together, begin-
ning a new relationship not just with 
UAE but also with Bahrain, it was a re-
markable day in world history. 
In 70 years of Israel’s history, only 
two nations that are Arab nations have 
recognized 
Israel’s 
right 
to 
exist, 
even—Jordan and Egypt. In 1 day, two 
more nations joined—the UAE and 
Bahrain. It was significant to be able 
to see the journey on that and to be 
able to hear the Foreign Ministers of 
Bahrain and UAE compliment Presi-
dent Trump, Mike Pompeo, and Jared 
Kushner for their leadership and, as 
the Foreign Minister from Bahrain 
said, President Trump’s statesmanship 
in this process. 
It was a negotiation that was turned 
on its head. For decades, American ne-
gotiators have tried to work to solve 
the issues with the Palestinians first 
and then to work to solve every other 
relationship second. That has been the 
American focus. The Trump negotia-
tions reversed it. They believed that 
many in the Arab world were tired of 
the Palestinians holding their foreign 
policy hostage, and they flipped it and 
said: Why don’t we start negotiating 
with the Arab world first and see if 
they want to open up trade negotia-
tions with Israel and be able to sta-
bilize those negotiations? 
It has worked. Not only has it 
worked in two countries—in a single 
day signing an agreement—but there 
are multiple other nations that are 
currently looking at this same deal 
with Israel to say: Yes, we still need to 
resolve the issues in the Palestinian 
territory. Yes, that is still very impor-
tant. But these nations can work to-
ward peace and unity together as they 
resolve their differences. 
They signed a document dealing with 
relationships diplomatically, but they 
also signed something they called the 
Abraham Accords Declaration. Let me 
read this accord to you because it is 
significant. It begins with this simple 
statement: 
We, the undersigned, recognize the impor-
tance of maintaining and strengthening 
peace in the Middle East and around the 
world based on mutual understanding and 
coexistence, as well as respect for human 
dignity and freedom, including religious 
freedom. 
That is a significant statement. Na-
tions have spoken of religious freedom, 
but it has not thrived there. 
The document goes on to say: 
We seek tolerance and respect for every 
person in order to make this world a place 
where all can enjoy a life of dignity and 
hope, no matter their race, faith, or eth-
nicity. 
We support science, art, medicine, and 
commerce to inspire humankind, maximize 
human potential and bring nations closer to-
gether. 
We seek to end radicalization and conflict 
to provide all children a better future. 
We pursue a vision of peace, security, and 
prosperity in the Middle East and around the 
world. 
It was a document many people said 
would never be signed, but it is a stake 
in the ground to say it is a new day in 
the Middle East in peace negotiations 
and 
a 
pivot, 
as 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu said. 
Nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
Qatar, Amman, Morocco, Sudan, and 
Lebanon should take notice and should 
see the benefit to economic trade and 
engagement, to confronting Iranian in-
fluence in the area that tries to desta-
bilize so much of the Middle East, 
pushing back on terrorism, and devel-
oping 
partnerships 
in 
science 
and 
health and technology and prosperity 
for everyone in the region. That hap-
pened this week. 
f 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. LANKFORD. There is something 
happening on Monday that much of the 
world has missed as well in the Middle 
East. For a year, there has been a proc-
ess ongoing to be able to confront Iran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5696 
September 17, 2020 
Iran has actively stated they are going 
to continue to pursue their nuclear am-
bitions. They have actively stated they 
are going to pursue weapons deals. 
They have actively stated they want to 
continue to break the arms embargo. 
Some of our allies have stood silent, 
but Iran has discussed purchasing 
weapons of all types from all places. 
We 
used 
to 
be 
united—regardless 
whether it was nuclear or not—that 
Iran should not continue to accelerate 
that. As the largest exporter of ter-
rorism in the world, we should confront 
what Iran is trying to do—continue to 
provide heavy arms. 
As of Monday, the United States will 
move into a different mode with Iran. 
As of midnight Sunday night, snap 
back sanctions begin on Iran on Mon-
day. And that is a different moment for 
us as a nation, to say we have stated as 
a country, now through multiple Presi-
dencies, that we will not allow Iran to 
be a nuclear power or to continue to 
arm itself in such a way to do its 
neighbors harm. 
When snap back sanctions occur on 
Monday, all of our allies should be 
aware that the United States is stead-
fast in that commitment. We would 
ask you to join us in that as well. 
Over the past few months, thousands 
of troops have come back home from 
the Middle East—from Syria, from 
Iraq, from Afghanistan. By the end of 
this year, we will have 4,500 troops still 
in Afghanistan; that is from a high just 
a few years ago of 100,000 boots on the 
ground. 
Ongoing negotiations for peace con-
tinue between Afghan leadership and 
the Taliban. Those are problems that 
have existed for decades and in some 
areas, generations. 
While I don’t believe Afghanistan 
will suddenly break out and be a bas-
tion of peace for the world, we do have 
a responsibility to help them where we 
can but also an obligation to protect 
our sons and daughters. Our blood and 
our treasures spilled in Afghanistan for 
decades. We shouldn’t lose the invest-
ment of that blood and treasure. But it 
is good to see so many people coming 
home. 
In Europe, a free-trade agreement is 
actively being negotiated with the UK. 
We are pleased to be able to partner 
with such a special-relationship coun-
try like the United Kingdom. We have 
had a long-lasting friendship with them 
since we settled a little conflict in 1776 
and another dustup in 1812. That spe-
cial relationship with the UK should 
continue on with a very good trade 
agreement. 
I am pleased that the administration 
continues to push forward in the area 
of trade—an area that it is amazing to 
me how many people didn’t even notice 
was the powder keg of Europe that just 
recently was resolved. 
For generations, the area around Ser-
bia, Kosovo have been a hotbed area for 
conflict. 
In the past few weeks, the Trump ad-
ministration has negotiated a peace 
deal between Serbia and Kosovo that 
leaves Serbia to actually officially rec-
ognize Kosovo. Again, that may not 
seem like a big deal to many other peo-
ple, 
but 
to 
Oklahomans—many 
of 
whom have served in our 45th and who 
have served there in Kosovo, helping to 
protect and stabilize that country and 
provide security there in that region— 
it is very significant to us to be able to 
see peace breaking out between Serbia 
and Kosovo. 
I am pleased that, while many people 
in the world don’t even pay attention 
to what is happening in Serbia and 
Kosovo, the Trump administration has, 
and their diplomatic team has been 
very engaged in negotiating that and 
bringing to them some stability. 
Interestingly enough, in the negotia-
tions both Serbia and Kosovo also 
agreed to designate Hezbollah as a for-
eign terrorist organization and to rec-
ognize Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel and to be able to move their em-
bassies to Jerusalem, which is another 
affirmation of what is happening in the 
Middle East in the string of what is on-
going. 
One last comment that many people 
may have missed, we all grieve for 
what is happening in Lebanon. That ex-
periment in multiracial, multifaith, 
and cooperative government has been a 
struggle, but they have been a strong-
hold for religious tolerance in Lebanon. 
Watching the hundreds of people who 
were killed and thousands who were in-
jured in the explosion at their docks in 
Beirut was painful for the entire world. 
The United States has stepped up as 
being the top donor to humanitarian 
aid to Lebanon during this time period, 
and we are engaging in multiple ways. 
At the end of the day, if we are going 
to help Lebanon be stable, we have to 
help that experiment in democracy 
there in the Middle East to be able to 
thrive with transparency. 
I partnered with Senator MURPHY 
and several other colleagues to help set 
our Nation’s priority to help Lebanon 
rebuild, including to utilize the U.S. 
International 
Development 
Finance 
Corporation, called the DFC, to help 
them in their infrastructure projects; 
to push out China, which is trying to 
work their way into the Middle East 
and dominate there; to allow the peo-
ple of Lebanon to decide their own fu-
ture; to leverage leadership in the 
International Monetary Fund to pre-
vent multilateral bailouts that don’t 
allow for real reforms in their banking 
system; and to push out corruption and 
push out Hezbollah. 
There are things we can do that are 
not of a partisan nature on which Sen-
ator MURPHY and I cooperate together 
to be able to help push for Lebanon. It 
is important that they continue to be a 
stable force in the region. This is a real 
time of testing for them as a country. 
I am proud the administration has 
pushed our diplomats in Lebanon to be 
able to find ways where we can prac-
tically help now and long term for real 
reforms for them. There is a lot going 
on around the world. 
While we are focused on COVID, 
rightfully so for our own health, while 
we focus on our economy, rightfully so, 
and while we focus on the issues of ra-
cial inequality, rightfully so, we can-
not lose track of the issues we also 
need to be engaged in around the 
world. It is important that America 
continue to be a leader in diplomacy 
and a leader in bringing religious lib-
erty and freedom and opportunity for 
all people. 
Whether you are in Hong Kong, as we 
discussed before, or whether you are in 
Abu Dhabi, all people deserve the rec-
ognition of their humanity and respect 
and an opportunity to be able to live 
their lives with freedom. Let’s con-
tinue to stand for the values that de-
fine us and define us together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I am sure 
you and I and all the Members of this 
body remember that night in late 
March. It was late at night. I remem-
ber standing in the back of the Cham-
ber to see one of the truly historic 
votes. It was a unanimous vote of the 
U.S. Senate to pass the CARES Act. It 
was an amazing achievement to see the 
Senate and the Congress come together 
in that way with the White House, with 
the President, to help meet the needs 
of the American people. 
When we passed that bill back in 
March, September seemed a long way 
away. We thought we had provided 
enough aid for small businesses. It 
turns out we didn’t. We thought we had 
provided enough aid for people, unfor-
tunately, who have fallen into unem-
ployment through no fault of their own 
but the fault of this dreaded COVID, 
but we didn’t provide enough. 
We hoped that we had provided 
enough for first responders, for schools, 
for healthcare professionals, for test-
ing, and for all the things that were 
necessary to get us out of this terrible 
pandemic. It turns out that wasn’t the 
case. Here we are in September facing 
a renewed version of this virus that is 
now spreading in parts of the country 
that weren’t affected back in March. 
I want to address, No. 1, that we 
must do something. We have to respond 
to the needs of the American people 
just as we did in March. I don’t under-
stand why this time it seems to be a 
partisan issue; why this time we can’t 
have the same spirit that we had then 
of negotiation, of give and take, of 
compromise to reach a bill that all re-
alize now was a really significant ac-
complishment. 
For some reason, now it just seems 
to be much harder. I understand the 
concern about the debt and the deficit. 
I used to be a Governor. I know about 
balancing budgets. States have to bal-
ance their budgets, but now is not the 
time. If we don’t take further action to 
shore up the economy and protect the

people who are being impacted by this, 
the fiscal cost in the long run will be 
worse. The revival of the economy will 
take longer. The cost to the Treasury 
will be greater than what we are pro-
posing to spend now. 
I believe and I hope that we are mov-
ing slowly toward some kind of agree-
ment that will allow us to provide the 
support to the American people and the 
American economy that will make 
such a difference in how we are able to 
cope with this terrible disease over the 
next several months—at least through 
the end of the year. That is really the 
mission that is before us. 
The Democrats made a proposal back 
in May. They passed the Heroes Act of 
over $3 trillion. They have moved. The 
Speaker and the minority leader here 
have moved $1 trillion. They made a 
counteroffer a few weeks ago of about 
$2 trillion. The White House appar-
ently, over the last couple of days, has 
said we are now talking about some-
thing at $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion as a 
solution. The parties are moving, and I 
hope today that they will continue to 
discuss and that the table will have 
people sitting at it trying to find a so-
lution. I think there is hope that we 
can do that. 
I deeply hope that we can come to an 
agreement. Schools across the country 
are seeing, unbelievably, additional ex-
penditures in all areas to try to get 
back to normal, to try to get back into 
the classroom. If they are going to do 
that, they need more buses. They are 
going to need more teachers. They are 
going to need more people. They are 
going to need more cleaning materials. 
They are going to need all kinds of ad-
ditional expenditures they weren’t an-
ticipating. 
Small businesses are continuing to 
teeter. I hear awful stories about small 
businesses that between now and the 
end of the year are in danger of closing 
their doors forever. That would be a 
tragedy for our country. 
We are continuing to see people lose 
their jobs. We are continuing to see 
people on unemployment. We are con-
tinuing to see people who can’t put 
food on the table because the aid that 
we provided in the CARES Act in 
March ran out at the end of July. 
I am urging, No. 1, discussions. That 
is pretty obvious. I hope that the rep-
resentatives of the two parties and rep-
resentatives of the White House can 
come together and reach an agreement. 
Part of this agreement has to contain 
within it support for States, towns, and 
cities. They are suffering, too, and they 
are providing the very services that the 
people need in this pandemic. 
States can’t borrow money the way 
we can. They have to balance their 
budget on a year-to-year basis. If they 
are being clobbered by the effects of 
this disease, not only in expenditures 
but in loss of revenues, they only have 
two choices. I have been there. They 
only have two choices. One is drastic 
cuts, and the other is raising taxes, 
neither of which is an acceptable alter-
native in the midst of a recession, and 
neither of which makes any sense for 
the American people. They have either 
to cut or raise taxes. Those aren’t good 
options. 
By the way, I can only speak for the 
Maine budget. I don’t know how other 
State budgets work. But in Maine 
about one-third of our budget—between 
25 percent and 35 percent of our State 
budget—goes back to our communities. 
It goes to the capital city of Augusta, 
makes a U-turn, and goes back into the 
towns and cities across Maine, mostly 
in the form of general-purpose aid to 
education, also in the form of revenue 
sharing, and in other kinds of grants 
and contracts. 
When we talk about the State, it 
sounds like we are talking about these 
big, impersonal entities, but we are 
really 
talking 
about 
towns—small 
towns—and school districts. That is 
where a lot of this impact is going to 
fall. 
It is a double-edged sword that cuts 
both ways. It is hurting people—the 
people who are being laid off, the peo-
ple who are going to have to be laid off, 
whether they are in a town or city, a 
county or the State. That hurts the 
economy. Those are people who are 
buying things in the stores, going to 
restaurants, 
and 
going 
to 
grocery 
stores. They are going to places to buy 
clothes, and if they can’t do that, then, 
the entire economy is pulled down. 
If we don’t help the States and the 
cities and towns in this situation, the 
estimates are that it is going to hit 
GDP by 2 to 3 percent. That is huge. 
That is a huge economic loss that is 
going to translate into a fiscal loss for 
us and a tragic loss for the American 
people. 
The estimate in Maine is a $1.4 bil-
lion shortfall of our State budget over 
the next 3 years—a half-billion dollars 
in this fiscal year that we are in right 
now. 
Towns and cities across Maine are al-
ready starting to furlough first re-
sponders. Who is it that works for the 
towns? Who is it that works for the cit-
ies? Police and fire are the biggest 
components. They are not hiring peo-
ple. I think we need to face the fact 
that those who are opposing aid to our 
cities and towns are the people who are 
defunding the police. That is who is 
defunding the police because their 
budgets are going to be cut if they 
don’t get some assistance from this 
body and this government. 
Let’s be real. Let’s talk about facts. 
Let’s talk about the real impact of our 
lack of attention to this issue. This is 
a personal tragedy for these families, 
and it is one more blow to the econ-
omy. 
By the way, this is not a blue State 
issue. Here are some States whose 
budgets have been hit by more than 10 
percent by the loss of revenues caused 
by the COVID: Alaska, which is not 
much of a blue State; Indiana; Kansas; 
Kentucky; Montana; Oklahoma; and 
Iowa. Those States are hurting, too. 
This blue State-red State stuff bothers 
me. 
I don’t know how many emergency 
appropriations for natural disasters, 
wildfires, floods, and hurricanes I have 
voted for. It never occurred to me to 
ask what color the State was. It never 
occurred to me. We are a community. 
This is one country. I don’t ask how 
Florida voted if there is a hurricane 
that strikes that State or Georgia or 
Alabama, which is being hit right now. 
If they need help, we should provide it. 
But what we are seeing now is a slow- 
motion fiscal hurricane that is hitting 
many, if not all, of the States of the 
United States. We should come to-
gether and help them. As for this busi-
ness about that, well, we don’t want to 
bail out somebody’s pension program, 
look, this is an easy calculation. The 
Treasury Department is capable of 
making the calculation. What were 
your revenues last year? What were 
your projections before COVID? What 
is the difference? That is what we are 
talking about. 
Make no mistake, we are talking 
about real, concrete, on-the-ground 
losses of jobs and losses of the services 
that those jobs provide. Whether they 
are public health workers, first re-
sponders, firefighters, or police—yes, 
police—they are who are being im-
pacted here, and it is we as citizens 
who are the customers of those services 
who need the protection and who need 
the services they provide. They are 
who are being hurt. 
I hope that we can come to an agree-
ment and that we can get over this 
nonsense that this is somehow a blue 
State-red State thing and that we are 
bailing out States that were not pru-
dent. I am tired of hearing that. We are 
talking about people’s lives here. We 
are talking about the protection of 
public services. We are talking about 
teaching our kids. We are talking 
about people who are providing the 
basic protections that we all take for 
granted in our daily lives. 
Really, I have two simple messages: 
One, let’s make a deal. Two, that deal 
should include support for those people 
and institutions in our States, in our 
cities, and in our smallest towns so 
that they will have the wherewithal to 
be able to help us all get through this 
thing together. That is what this is all 
about, and those are the people on the 
ground who are helping us get through 
this together. 
We can do this. We proved in March 
that we could do it. I think we must 
and can and will do it again.

September 17, 2020 
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF 
DEMOCRACY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to commemorate the International 
Day of Democracy. Since 2007, Sep-
tember 15 has offered an opportunity 
each year to reflect on the democratic 
values that we cherish and to recom-
mit 
ourselves 
to 
promoting 
them 
around the world. 
The democratic project is especially 
important at this moment. Although 
some communities are experiencing 
greater rights and freedoms than ever 
before, there is also an alarming trend 
of democratic backsliding in many cor-
ners of the globe. 
Countries that were becoming in-
creasingly open and egalitarian are 
moving back toward authoritarianism 
under unlawful, oppressive leaders. 
Meanwhile, countries that were al-
ready unfree are suffering even more 
disturbing civil and human rights 
abuses. 
If we turn a blind eye to these devel-
opments, it will embolden bad actors to 
continue undermining freedom, peace, 
and equality. The United States must 
lead all democracy-loving people in 
calling out subversions of democratic 
rights wherever they exist and holding 
those responsible to account. 
One country that requires our urgent 
attention is China. The Government of 
China has not adhered to democratic 
norms for a long time, but we should 
never allow that failure to normalize 
ongoing human rights abuses such as 
the vicious opposition to the Uighurs. 
International nongovernmental orga-
nizations 
have 
documented China’s 
mass surveillance, arbitrary detention, 
torture, and political indoctrination of 
these communities for no reason other 
than their religious and cultural dif-
ferences. 
We must do everything possible to 
fight for the freedom and equality of 
the Uighurs to help end this atrocity. 
We also need to stand up for the 
rights of the people of Hong Kong. Bei-
jing’s attempt to circumvent Hong 
Kong’s independent legal system with a 
far-reaching, oppressive national secu-
rity law is dangerous and in complete 
disregard of the one-country, two-sys-
tem principle. I am likewise disturbed 
that 
the 
Hong 
Kong 
government 
inexplicably postponed the September 
regional elections for another year. 
The people of Hong Kong deserve to see 
their democratic aspirations realized 
and protected. I am pleased that there 
is bipartisan, strong support in the 
U.S. Senate and in the House for the 
people of Hong Kong, and I joined with 
Senator RUBIO in introducing legisla-
tion to make that clear. 
China is certainly not the only place 
where democratic rights are threat-
ened. We need to look closer to home, 
as well, to countries like Venezuela. In 
Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro’s illegal re-
gime has produced one of the worst hu-
manitarian crises by plundering the 
country’s resources for personal gain 
and using the distribution of food as a 
tool for social control. Maduro has 
completely ignored the Venezuelan 
people’s call to return to democracy 
and is using the current global pan-
demic as an opportunity to consolidate 
his own power. 
In addition to addressing quasi-dicta-
torships in the Western Hemisphere, we 
must maintain pressure on the so- 
called 
‘‘last 
dictator’’ 
of 
Europe, 
Belarusian 
President 
Aleksandr 
Lukashenko. While Lukashenko’s near 
three-decade rule has been full of cor-
rupt power grabs and crackdowns and 
dissent, his behavior surrounding the 
recent 
Presidential 
election 
dem-
onstrates a new level of lawlessness. 
Lukashenko refused to certify opposing 
candidates and then imprisoned them. 
He claimed victory through clearly 
fraudulent election results. He re-
stricted the free flow of information by 
shutting down the internet and tar-
geting journalists. And he oversaw the 
brutal repression of protesters, includ-
ing many instances of Belarusian secu-
rity forces repeatedly torturing de-
tained civilians. Lukashenko knows 
that the Belarusian people are ready 
for a new democratic chapter that does 
not include him. Instead of stepping 
aside to serve the interests of his coun-
try, he has abandoned the rule of law 
in order to protect his own power. 
It is no surprise that Lukashenko has 
appealed to Vladimir Putin to endorse 
this tyrannical approach. President 
Putin is, after all, a veteran when it 
comes to destabilizing democracies. He 
has done so not only in his own coun-
try of Russia, where he overcomes dis-
sent by changing the constitution to 
secure his rule and poisoning political 
opponents, but also in other parts of 
the world. That includes his contin-
uous attempts to undermine our de-
mocracy here in the United States. 
President 
Trump 
has 
completely 
failed to hold Vladimir Putin account-
able for abusing his own people’s 
human rights and attacking the United 
States. Even worse, President Trump 
appears to have taken a page out of 
Putin’s book, suggesting that if he 
were not reelected this November, he 
may not accept the results of that elec-
tion. It is a sad commentary on the 
state of our domestic affairs that we 
have to take such a ludicrous state-
ment seriously. We know that global 
democracy is in trouble when the lead-
er of the United States is copying un-
democratic heads of state instead of 
condemning them. 
These are but a few snapshots of 
what is happening in many countries 
around the world. If there is anything 
that I have learned in my many years 
of public service, it is that we can 
never take democracy—and all the 
freedoms, rights, and opportunities it 
entails—for granted. My work in the 
House and the Senate on the Helsinki 
Commission really embodies that com-
mitment to stand up for human rights. 
The Helsinki Final Act made it clear 
that all States in Europe, the former 
Soviet Union, United States, and Can-
ada embraced not only democratic 
principles and human rights of good 
governance but also the principle that 
we have a right to challenge the com-
pliance with those commitments in 
any other member state. It is not 
interfering in their internal matters; it 
is holding them to the commitments 
they made in the Helsinki Final Act. 
Democracy is fragile. It must be con-
stantly tended to and protected to sur-
vive and flourish. Therefore, while we 
have a responsibility to monitor the 
status of democracy in other parts of 
the world, we have a parallel duty to 
safeguard and tend to our democracy 
here at home. I cannot remember a 
more dangerous time for American de-
mocracy since the Civil War. 
To protect our democracy, we must 
protect the ability of every individual 
to exercise her or his right to vote. In 
the middle of a pandemic, that means 
expanding the ability to vote by mail 
so that we do not force people to 
choose between participating in our de-
mocracy or protecting their health. 
We need to make sure that State and 
local election boards get the resources 
they need to cover the costs of mail-in 
voting, and we need to defend the 
strength, integrity, and impartiality of 
the U.S. Postal Service. 
Our President also openly invites for-
eign powers to interfere in our elec-
tion, and his encouragement has been 
effective. The same external factors 
that we know influenced the elections 
in 2016 are once again actively planning 
to interfere in the upcoming election. 
Regardless of party affiliation, we 
should all be able to unite in pursuit of 
a 
healthy, 
functioning 
democracy. 
That requires us to take action against 
the foreign actors seeking to spread 
misinformation and divide Americans 
for their own benefit. 
When we fail to protect democracy in 
the United States, it has consequences 
all over the world. After he was con-
fronted about his recent brutal crack-
down on protesters, journalists, and op-
position members, Belarus President 
Lukashenko 
said 
that 
the 
United 
States ‘‘should sort out their own af-
fairs’’ before attempting to interfere in 
Belarus. His statements made clear 
that President Trump and his adminis-
tration and supporters’ undemocratic 
behavior is eroding our credibility on 
the global stage as a voice for human 
rights. Let today, International Day 
for Democracy, be a reminder for us to 
stand up in defense of democracy, 
whether we are talking about China, 
Venezuela, Belarus, or here in our own 
backyard. The world is counting on us. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
FAFSA 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
am here this morning to talk about a 
hearing that we had in the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee this morning that affects 20 
million families who have to fill this 
out every year. This is called the 
FAFSA. Usually, there is an adjective 
ahead of it. It is called the ‘‘dreaded’’ 
FAFSA. 
There are 400,000 Tennessee families 
who fill it out every year. If you want 
to go to college and you need a Pell 
grant or a student loan, you have to 
fill this out—108 questions. And then 
after you fill it out, the way it has 
been working and still works today, 
you have to send in the information on 
22 of the questions to two different 
agencies: one to the IRS and one to the 
Education Department. And then they 
go through an elaborate process to 
check to see whether you have made 
any mistake. 
So let’s say you are a homeless stu-
dent or a student in foster care or you 
are not able to identify your parents or 
you are living with your grandparents 
or any of those people have an aversion 
to filling out 108-question Federal 
forms or giving their information to 
the government twice, then you don’t 
go to college. That is what happens. 
In Tennessee, we have had a Gov-
ernor named Bill Haslam in the legisla-
ture that said everybody in Tennessee 
without a degree, that you can have 2 
more years of college free, but first you 
have to fill out this Federal form. They 
say this is the single biggest impedi-
ment to having the opportunity to 
have those 2 free years of higher edu-
cation in our State. 
So you would think somebody would 
do something about that, right? Well, 
somebody has or at least has been try-
ing to. Here is what it could be. This is 
33 questions. Almost everybody agrees 
that this is better than this—the State 
counselors, the Governors, the teach-
ers, the students, the families. You 
could fill it out more easily. It keeps 
many fewer students from walking 
away from the opportunity to go to 
college. 
So you would ask: Why don’t you 
pass it? Well, Mr. President, that is ex-
actly what Senator MICHAEL BENNET, 
the Democratic Senator from Colorado, 
and I said 7 years ago in a hearing be-
fore the Senate Education Committee 
when we had four witnesses and we 
talked about this. And I said at the 
end: There seems to be a lot of agree-
ment about this. Why don’t the four of 
you experts—and these are people who 
work in financial aid who try to help 
students and who try to help minority 
students. I mean, this is the kind of 
stuff we are talking about all over 
America today. What do we do about 
racial justice? What do we do to help 
low-income students? How do we help 
people who are especially hurt by a 
pandemic? 
Well, 7 years ago, I said: Would you 
be willing to write us a letter, each of 
you, and tell us exactly what to do to 
eliminate 
the 
complexity 
of 
this 
FAFSA? What they said was that most 
of these questions are unnecessary and 
that the Federal Government doesn’t 
need to know the answer to these ques-
tions to decide whether you are eligible 
for a Pell grant or eligible for a student 
loan. That is what they all said. So the 
four witnesses who had testified looked 
at each other and said: We don’t need 
to write you separate letters. We will 
write you one letter because we all 
agree on what to do. So they did. 
Senator BENNET and I introduced leg-
islation called the FAST Act that 
would reduce this to the size of a post-
card. It only had two questions on it. 
Well, that was too simplified. What we 
found out, for example, was that the 
State of Indiana and the State of Ten-
nessee have their student aid, and they 
rely on some of this information to de-
cide what aid to give in addition to the 
Federal aid. So we took the questions 
off this, and then they would have to 
ask the questions, so we really hadn’t 
solved any problems. 
So we kept working. Senator MUR-
RAY, the Democratic leader of our com-
mittee, and I worked together on this 
during these 7 years, and we began to 
make some progress. The progress we 
made first was with the Obama admin-
istration, and they agreed to what 
sounded like a simple change. They 
just administratively allowed you to 
use your previous year’s tax returns 
rather than your current year’s tax re-
turns to fill out the 22 tax questions on 
this form. You can imagine how hard it 
would be to use this year’s tax returns, 
so that was a big help. 
Then the Trump administration put 
this 108-questionnaire on an app so you 
can use your iPhone to fill it out. Now, 
that would be pretty hard for me, but I 
have seen a lot of the youngsters in 
Tennessee in the Sevier County High 
School, for example, who went right to 
work. They did a pretty quick job of 
doing this. That helped a lot. 
Then, Senator MURRAY and I, Sen-
ator JONES from Alabama and Senator 
SCOTT from South Carolina—last year 
we introduced a bill called the FU-
TURE Act, and the FUTURE Act did 
two things. It said that for 22 of the 
questions here, the ones that you have 
to give to the government twice—you 
give it to the Education Department 
and you give it to the IRS, and then 
they check to see if you made a mis-
take, and if they do, they slow down 
your aid. We said: Let’s simplify that. 
Let’s just say all you have to do is 
check a box, and the IRS will answer 
those 22 questions for you. That is a 
law now, and it will take a couple of 
years to implement because, again, we 
are talking about 20 million families a 
year. So we saved them that trouble. 
Now, guess what else we saved. We 
saved enough money to permanently 
fund historically Black colleges. How 
about that? Filling out all this form 
didn’t save the government money; it 
cost the government money. So we 
were able, in one act, to save 20 million 
families—many of them minority fami-
lies and most of them low income—the 
trouble of filling out those 22 questions 
and permanently fund Black colleges. 
So now we have legislation, Senator 
JONES and I and others—and there are 
many Senators who have been involved 
in this, in addition to Senator MURRAY. 
Senator BOOKER has had an interest, 
and Senator COLLINS, Senator KING, 
Senator BURR. Again, I mentioned Sen-
ator BENNET earlier. You can see Re-
publicans and Democrats all see the 
wisdom of this, as well as every witness 
we have ever had who comes before us. 
So we have a new bill that says: Let’s 
get rid of 53 questions and turn this 
into this. That is what the hearing was 
about today. 
Now, why wouldn’t we do that? Al-
most everyone says we should. Should 
we deliberately require 20 million fami-
lies to answer 53 unnecessary questions 
that discourage many low-income stu-
dents from going to college? Should we 
insist on that? I don’t think so. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, this would probably mean 
that about 400,000 more students would 
apply for Pell grants. That is what the 
Pell grant is for. It is to encourage low- 
income students who want a ticket to 
the head of the line, a ticket called 
higher education, a ticket that the col-
lege board said increases your earnings 
by $1 million over your lifetime if you 
get a 4-year degree, and this is our ef-
fort to help low-income students get 
that ticket to a better life and a better 
education and more money. 
So why wouldn’t we do it and why 
wouldn’t we do it during this pan-
demic? This has to be the strangest 
year of college in a century—at least a 
century. Students are stressed out, 
families are stressed out, and then we 
are going to add to the stress by say-
ing: And in addition, your friendly Fed-
eral Government, in order for you to 
get a Pell grant, is going to insist that 
you answer 53 questions that everybody 
says are unnecessary for the govern-
ment to determine whether you are eli-
gible for the loan or for the grant. 
And then there is one final reason we 
should do it. The act that Senator 
MURRAY and Senator JONES and Sen-
ator SCOTT and I introduced and be-
came law last year with President 
Trump’s signature, the one that saved 
enough money to permanently fund 
historically Black colleges, that is 
going to take a couple of years to im-
plement. So if we go ahead and pass the 
law that turns this into this before the 
end of this year, we can do both of 
them at the same time. 
I think the American people would 
feel pretty good about the U.S. Con-
gress that, in the midst of a pandemic, 
finished its work on such an important 
piece of legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5700 
September 17, 2020 
Our hearing today was well attended. 
We had four of the same witnesses who 
came 7 years ago and said: There is no 
need to ask all these questions. Nobody 
needs them. Nobody needs the answers. 
All it does is turn away from college 
students whom we want to encourage 
to go. 
Now, think about that. That is a de-
liberate act by the Federal Govern-
ment not to change that. It doesn’t 
save any money. It doesn’t eliminate 
any fraud. All it does is turn away 
from college the people whom we want 
to encourage to have a chance to go. 
I am hopeful that the hearing today 
and our repeated efforts will help us 
create approval of this before the end 
of the year. Since nobody tells me they 
are against it, you would think we 
would do it. Sometimes people say: 
Well, we need to agree on everything 
before we pass anything. Sometimes 
that is true. But when something is 
this important, when it affects this 
many families, and when it comes at a 
time when families are under stress 
anyway, 
let’s 
turn 
a 
108-question 
FAFSA into a 33-question FAFSA. 
Let’s allow that to be implemented by 
the Federal Government at the same 
time last year’s law is implemented, 
and let’s make it simpler and easier for 
deserving Americans to go to college. 
There are lots of other things we 
need to do about higher education. We 
need more accountability. We need to 
deal with student loans. There are 
many things we need to do. We have 
had a lot of discussions about those. 
We are not going to get agreement on 
that this year, but just as we were able 
to do for the historically Black col-
leges last year and the first step of the 
FAFSA, I think it would be wise to fin-
ish the job. 
I was very pleased with our hearing. 
I am grateful to Senator MURRAY for 
her kind comments this morning that 
she made and for her friendship and her 
willingness to work with me on this, 
and I would hope that, for the benefit 
of those 20 million families, we would 
have some success. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
RECOGNIZING IGIUGIG, ALASKA 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday, and as you know, it is one of 
my favorite times of the week. 
The Presiding Officer has the good 
fortune of listening to a number of the 
‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ speeches when 
I get to come down to the floor—typi-
cally every Thursday—to talk about a 
person or group of people who are doing 
great things for my State. As I said, so 
many of my colleagues here—even 
some of the reporters—know this is the 
person we call our Alaskan of the 
Week, but sometimes we call them our 
Alaskans of the Week. 
This week, we are going plural in a 
big way. This week, we are recognizing 
an entire community for how this com-
munity—the whole community—band-
ed together to literally help save a 
young child who was sick and needed 
medical attention. 
Before I get into the story, let me 
say that, in Alaska, community is ev-
erything. Living in one of the most 
magnificent places in the world is not 
without its challenges. We depend on 
each other. Communities often come 
together to help each other. Typically, 
in our rural communities, traditional 
knowledge is critical and so is hard- 
won ingenuity and determination to 
overcome many of the challenges in 
living in the great State of Alaska. 
I would like to transport you to one 
of those communities. It is the village 
of Igiugig in Southwest Alaska. Rich in 
Native traditions, Igiugig is home to 
around 70 year-round residents, grow-
ing to over 200 in the summer months. 
The name ‘‘Igiugig’’ originated from 
a Yupik word meaning ‘‘like a throat 
that swallows water,’’ referring to the 
village’s location where the Kvichak 
River meets Iliamna. 
Going all the way back to the pur-
chase of Alaska from Russia over 150 
years ago, Igiugig has maintained a 
commercial fishing and subsistence- 
based economy. They have been incred-
ibly innovative with alternative energy 
there—wind and hydro—and most im-
portantly, this community has main-
tained a strong sense of connection 
with each other, which is so important 
for communities like this. This is evi-
denced by what happened just a few 
weeks ago when a young girl needed to 
be airlifted out of the community to 
Anchorage—some 250 miles away—for 
medical help, and nearly every member 
of the community pitched in to help. 
What happened? Here is what hap-
pened. On the night of August 28—so 
about 3 or 4 weeks ago—around 11:30 
a.m., the Tribal administrator and vil-
lage council vice president Karl Hill 
was sitting at home when he saw the 
LifeMed Alaska flight, which he knew 
was coming in to help this young girl, 
circling above the small runway. 
Over 200 of our communities aren’t 
connected by roads. They aren’t con-
nected by roads, so a lot of them have 
very small airports and landing strips. 
Karl got this phone call when the 
pilot was above circling. There was a 
problem with the runway lights; they 
weren’t working. He ran out to the air-
port to try to turn the lights on manu-
ally. That didn’t work, so he got into 
his plane—he was one of only two pi-
lots in the village with a plane. He got 
on the plane just to talk to the pilot, 
who was circling above, over the head-
set. That pilot who was on the medevac 
flight told him he was getting low on 
fuel. He wouldn’t be able to circle 
much longer, and he couldn’t land. But 
this young girl needed help as soon as 
possible. 
In so many of our Native commu-
nities and rural communities, there is 
no hospital. There is barely even a 
medical clinic sometimes. So she need-
ed to be medevacked. 
While Karl communicated with the 
pilot over his headset, other commu-
nity members began calling people in 
the community asking for help. Ida 
Nelson made calls and jumped on her 
four-wheeler and headed to the airport. 
Community leader Christina Salmon, 
whose sister is Alexanna Salmon—who 
was our Alaskan of the Week in 2017, 
by the way—made around 32 phone 
calls. Health aide Amanda Bybee, Jeff 
Bringhurst, and so many others started 
calling and rallying this community, 
and they all came out. They all came 
out in any kind of vehicle with lights 
that they had—trucks, cars, ATVs, 
kids on four-wheelers, many still in 
their pajamas. This was in the middle 
of the night. They arrived to provide 
enough light on the runway for the 
pilot to see the landing strip. They 
staggered the vehicles facing east and 
running the whole length of the run-
way, lighting the medevac pilot’s way. 
They waited intensely. Ida Nelson 
told a reporter: 
I was anxious and nervous. . . . I was like, 
‘‘so what if that was my baby (waiting for 
that) plane?’’ What if it was my young girl 
who needed lifesaving help? 
They waited for the plane to touch 
down, for the girl to be transferred, and 
for the plane to take off again. All of 
this happened with the lights provided 
by the community in a makeshift 
lighting of the runway. 
By this time, it was around a little 
past 1:30, closer to 2 o’clock, but when 
the plane took off, the community, of 
course, was in a celebratory mood. 
‘‘We were pumped up,’’ Karl Hill said. 
‘‘It was really an amazing feat that we 
were able to pull together so quickly’’ 
in the middle of the night. He added, 
‘‘It was really a nice evening.’’ 
That young girl who needed to be 
medevacked and airlifted in Anchorage 
is now back in the community, and she 
has recovered, thank God. 
LifeMed Alaska, which provided the 
medevac, posted a photo on social 
media with the following caption: 
‘‘What appears to be a blurry, dark 
photo is actually a view of what an 
amazing community can do with a lot 
of determination,’’ lighting a runway, 
saving a life. Indeed. 
We are so proud to be a State full of 
such tight-knit communities that work 
together every day to make Alaska so 
special. We are particularly proud as 
we recount the events of August 28 in 
Igiugig and so grateful to everyone in 
the community who came out in the 
middle of the night, some in their paja-
mas, to make sure that young girl 
could get the medical help she needed. 
Thank you to Igiugig for being such 
an amazing community with great de-
termination, great heart, and great in-
novation. Congratulations to all of you 
for being our Alaskans of the Week.

f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the package of four Illi-
nois district court nominees who are 
scheduled to receive votes on the floor 
this week. 
In my State, Democrats and Repub-
licans have long worked together in a 
respectful, bipartisan way to select 
Federal judges. 
For example, when two Illinois va-
cancies opened up on the 7th Circuit in 
2017, back before Senate Republicans 
decided to abandon the circuit court 
blue slip, we were able to negotiate a 
package of two well-qualified nomi-
nees, 
Amy 
St. 
Eve 
and 
Michael 
Scudder, who both were confirmed by 
the Senate unanimously. 
For district court vacancies, Illinois 
has a longstanding ‘‘three to one’’ sys-
tem. 
Under this system, the President’s 
party gets to select the candidates for 
three out of four district court vacan-
cies, and the other party gets to select 
the candidate for the fourth. Then the 
parties negotiate until they reach 
agreement on packages of nominees 
that can move forward to confirma-
tion. 
Under this system, Democrats and 
Republicans have to work together and 
compromise. Neither side gets every-
thing they want, but for several dec-
ades, this bipartisan process has kept 
both parties at the table and has served 
Illinois well. 
During President Trump’s tenure, 
there have been two packages of Illi-
nois district court nominees that we 
have negotiated with the senior Mem-
ber of the Republican congressional 
delegation—Representative JOHN SHIM-
KUS—and the White House. 
The first was a package of four Chi-
cago nominees—now judges—that in-
cluded Democratic pick Mary Rowland, 
a former Federal public defender and 
the first openly LGBT judge on the 
Chicago bench. 
The second package of Illinois nomi-
nees, which we negotiated throughout 
2019 and agreed upon last December, in-
cludes Federal Magistrate Judge Iain 
Johnston of Rockford; Illinois 3rd Judi-
cial Circuit Judge David Dugan of 
Madison County; Illinois 20th Judicial 
Circuit Judge Stephen McGlynn of St. 
Clair County; and the Democratic pick, 
Judge Franklin Valderrama of the 
Cook County Circuit Court. 
All of the nominees in the current Il-
linois package have significant judicial 
experience and were rated well-quali-
fied by the American Bar Association. 
Each nominee also was reviewed by 
judicial screening committees that we 
established, including a Southern Dis-
trict 
judicial 
screening 
committee, 
chaired by former Federal judge Pat-
rick Murphy, and a Northern District 
committee, chaired by former Federal 
judge David Coar. Each nominee re-
ceived screening committee approval 
based on their qualifications and their 
record as judges. 
I want to say that I recognize and re-
spect the opposition that has been ex-
pressed to two of the Republican picks 
in this package, Judges Dugan and 
McGlynn. 
These nominees have made state-
ments and expressed views with which 
I disagree, particularly on matters in-
volving reproductive rights. 
These nominees would not have been 
Democratic picks in our Illinois sys-
tem, but under the system, Democrats 
and Republicans have to work together 
on bipartisan packages, and neither 
side gets everything their way. 
While I disagree with statements 
that Judges Dugan and McGlynn have 
made, I agreed to this package of nomi-
nees as part of our bipartisan State 
process, and I will support all four 
nominees in the package. 
I also want to briefly discuss the 
Democratic 
pick 
in 
this 
package, 
Judge Franklin Valderrama. 
For the past 14 years, he has served 
as an associate judge on the Circuit 
Court of Cook County. He has exten-
sive experience both as a judge and as 
a practitioner and is highly respected. 
When a Chicago-based Federal judge-
ship became vacant last year, we put 
out a public call for applications. An 
extraordinary group of 50 candidates 
applied. Our screening committee vet-
ted them all, and Judge Valderrama 
was at the top of the list. 
I believe he will be an outstanding 
addition to the Federal bench in Chi-
cago. 
f 
HONORING RYAN PHILLIP 
HENDRIX 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Sheriff Deputy 
Ryan Phillip Hendrix, 34, of Henderson-
ville who passed away on Thursday, 
September 10, 2020, while in the line of 
duty. He was born December 9, 1985, in 
Asheville, North Carolina to his par-
ents Donald L. and Heidi J. Hendrix. 
Ryan was a devoted Christian and at-
tended Grace Blue Ridge Church with 
Pastor Chas Morris. 
Shortly after graduating from Hen-
dersonville Christian School in 2004, 
Ryan enlisted with the U.S. Marine 
Corps and graduated as a lance cor-
poral marine in 2005. He was in the Ma-
rine Reserves for 5 years and volun-
teered to serve a tour of duty in Iraq in 
2006. Ryan began his career with the 
Henderson County Sheriff’s Office as a 
detention officer in June 2012. In May 
2015, he completed basic law enforce-
ment training and became a patrol dep-
uty and later a field training officer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5703 
September 17, 2020 
He was an active member of the Hen-
derson County Sheriff’s Office SWAT 
team and was assigned as a patrol de-
tective to Charlie Squad. 
Ryan excelled in sports, especially 
baseball and soccer, and enjoyed fish-
ing, hunting, biking, kayaking, and 
camping. Ryan’s children, Elloree and 
Merritt, were the love of his life and al-
ways his greatest priority. He spent all 
of his free time with them and contin-
ually involved them in outdoor activi-
ties. He enjoyed teaching them how to 
raise animals and spending time with 
their extended family of grandparents, 
aunts and uncles, and many cousins. 
Ryan had a keen instinct and could 
see things most couldn’t. He was swift 
to action and was very intuitive while 
possessing a magnanimous heart. He 
would choose not to fight with a fool, 
but rather help them to find a better 
way. Ryan loved to bring humor to 
every situation, and even during the 
roughest times, you would always see a 
smile on his face. 
Ryan tragically lost his life during 
the early morning hours of September 
10, 2020, while in the line of duty. As 
the world slept, Ryan responded to as-
sist a family in need of help when they 
became innocent victims of a violent 
encounter. 
We all know the tragic outcome, but 
Ryan refused to let the story end there. 
While his death will leave a giant void 
in the hearts of those who love him, he 
continues to exemplify a servant’s 
heart even in passing. Ryan was also an 
organ donor and will continue helping 
strangers for a lifetime, even after 
making the ultimate sacrifice. He was 
doing the job he was born to do and 
died doing the job he loved. 
As the U.S. Senator from North Caro-
lina, I am forever grateful for Ryan’s 
service to our State and Nation. He 
gave his life protecting his fellow citi-
zens, and we will never forget the sac-
rifice he made.

REMEMBERING MELISSIA DAVIS 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Mrs. Melissia 
Davis of Kennedy, AL, who passed 
away on September 7, 2020. She will be 
remembered as a dedicated public serv-
ant who was committed to bettering 
her community and State. 
Melissia worked diligently for 26 
years as the State representative in my 
U.S. Senate Office in Tuscaloosa, AL. 
She covered the West Alabama region, 
specifically serving the counties of 
Fayette, Greene, Hale, Lamar, Marion, 
Pickens, and Tuscaloosa. I first met 
Melissia when she was working for the 
Internal Revenue Service, and I was 
eager to hire her. I knew she would be 
an 
exemplary 
employee. 
Over 
the 
years, Melissia gained a deep under-
standing of constituent services and re-
mained dedicated to working with Fed-
eral, State, and local agencies on be-
half of my constituents. 
Melissia served with distinction on 
the board of trustees of her alma 
mater, Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, 
AL. She was the chairwoman of the 
Stillman 
House 
Restoration 
Com-
mittee for 13 years. Under her leader-
ship, the historic Stillman House was 
placed on the Alabama Historic Reg-
ister and National Register of Historic 
Places. She was also successful in plac-
ing Stillman College on the Alabama 
Register of Landmarks and Heritage, 
designating the campus as an Alabama 
Historic District. 
Outside of her professional career, 
Mrs. Davis was heavily involved with 
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., the 
West Alabama United Way Campaign, 
Habitat for Humanity, and several 
other local endeavors. Additionally, 
Melissia was a dedicated member of 
Elizabeth Baptist Church, where she 
taught Sunday school and served as a 
matron. Not only did Melissia live a 
life of service, she embodied it. 
Melissia’s 
many 
accomplishments 
and contributions to the State of Ala-
bama 
will 
long 
be 
remembered. 
Melissia was passionate about her 
hometown of Kennedy, AL, and she 
served as one of its strongest advo-
cates. She will be remembered for her 
great 
sense 
of 
humor 
and 
style. 
Melissia touched the lives of many 
over the years, and she will be greatly 
missed. 
I offer my deepest condolences to 
Melissia’s husband, Burkles Davis, II, 
and her two children, Alecia Nicole 
Davis and Burkles ‘‘Trey’’ Davis, III, 
and to all of their loved ones as they 
celebrate her life and mourn her pass-
ing. 
f 
100TH BIRTHDAY OF THE NFL 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commemorate the 100th birth-
day of the National Football League. 
On September 17, 1920, 15 people who 
shared a love of football met in an 
automobile showroom in Canton, OH, 
to form what would become the Na-
tional Football League. From these 
humble beginnings, the NFL has grown 
into a preeminent American sports 
league and become a fixture in Amer-
ican life. Today’s NFL is an American 
institution that brings together mil-
lions of individuals of all ages, races, 
and backgrounds through a shared love 
for the game of football. In fact, last 
season, the NFL concluded the celebra-
tion of its 100th season with a stunning 
Super Bowl championship that was 
viewed by over 100 million Americans. 
At the same time, the NFL has never 
forgotten its roots in Ohio. Every year, 
millions of football fans travel to Can-
ton, which now hosts the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame and the accompanying 
Hall of Fame game that rings in every 
new NFL season. Today, in an effort to 
commemorate the League’s 100th birth-
day, Canton and the Cleveland Browns 
will host my hometown Cincinnati 
Bengals in a classic rivalry game, 
known as the Battle of Ohio. The game 
will highlight the formation of the 
league and its origins in Canton, honor 
the more than 25,000 players who have 
played in the league, and showcase the 
work the NFL is doing to ensure its 
second century is just as successful as 
the first. 
I wish the league all the best as it 
embarks into its second century as the 
foremost 
steward 
of 
‘‘America’s 
Game.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF 
SPECIAL OLYMPICS ARKANSAS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in light of a significant anniver-
sary for a crucial organization in the 
state of Arkansas. Fifty years ago, 
Special Olympics Arkansas was found-
ed under the idea of an equal and op-
portune Arkansas. On this special day 
of celebration, I would like to recog-
nize and thank Special Olympics Ar-
kansas for its dedication to a virtuous 
mission that has transformed my State 
in more ways than one. 
Special Olympics Arkansas was de-
signed to fulfill and uphold a specific 
vision 
to 
transform 
communities 
through sports and education. To make 
this ambition a reality, the organiza-
tion provides individuals with intellec-
tual disabilities the opportunity to 
participate in year-round sports and 
athletic 
training. 
Just 
as 
Special 
Olympics Arkansas has a positive im-
pact on the field, it is also a powerful 
and effective catalyst for social change 
off the field. By offering a range of pro-
gramming 
efforts 
that 
encompass 
health, education, community building 
and leadership, Special Olympics Ar-
kansas is doing exactly what it set out 
to accomplish. 
Since its inception, the organization 
has seen increasing and overwhelming 
demand. Special Olympics Arkansas 
has 15,000 participating athletes and 
5,000 volunteers. Additionally, it offers 
training in 15 different sports with 240 
statewide competitions and has cul-
tivated participation in all 75 of the 
State’s counties. While the trans-
formative power of sports is at the or-
ganization’s core, competition is mere-
ly a gateway to creating avenues for 
individuals, both with and without in-
tellectual disabilities, to experience 
personal growth, find joy and gain con-
fidence. The addition of several new 
programs such as the Inclusive Health 
Program, Unified School Program, and 
the Unified Leadership Program has 
proven 
tremendously 
valuable 
in 
breaking down barriers and creating 
accepting and inclusive communities. 
Thanks to Special Olympics Arkansas, 
our State has experienced great social 
progress and meaningful change over 
the past 50 years. 
I cannot thank Special Olympics Ar-
kansas enough for its continued dedica-
tion to creating an environment where 
enhanced opportunity and acceptance 
take center stage. Arkansas citizens of 
all backgrounds, their families, and our

REMEMBERING THOMAS KANE 
GILHOOL 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
rise to recognize and pay tribute to 
Thomas Kane Gilhool, who championed 
the rights of inclusion for children and 
adults with disabilities and changed 
public policy in our country for all peo-
ple with disabilities. His work was piv-
otal in affirming the constitutional 
right of children with disabilities to a 
public education, increasing commu-
nity-based services for people with de-
velopmental disabilities, and creating 
a pathway for people with autism and 
other 
developmental 
disabilities 
to 
leave institutions and live with neigh-
bors, friends, and family. 
Tom Gilhool was an originating 
member of Philadelphia’s Community 
Legal Services. At the start of his ca-
reer, he helped to organize, train, and 
then represented the Philadelphia Wel-
fare Rights Organization and the Resi-
dents Advisory Board, as well as other 
organizations representing residents in 
low-income neighborhoods. The rec-
ognition agreements he secured em-
powered those organizations to effec-
tively represent welfare recipients and 
public housing tenants and served as 
models that were replicated through-
out the country. 
Tom Gilhool’s seminal accomplish-
ment was his groundbreaking represen-
tation of plaintiffs in the Pennsylvania 
Association 
for 
Retarded 
Citizens 
(PARC) v. the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, the Nation’s first civil rights 
case brought on behalf of children with 
disabilities. Kate Fialkowski, sister of 
two boys represented in the case, re-
members 
Tom 
as 
‘‘an 
intellectual 
giant, lawyer, and legal historian,’’ 
someone ‘‘who used his gifts not for 
self-aggrandizement, but instead to 
raise up the lives of others, including 
those with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities.’’ Prior to this case, 
children with disabilities were all but 
excluded 
from 
attending 
public 
schools. The decree of the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Penn-
sylvania in 1972 paved the way for the 
1975 passage of the Education for All 
Handicapped Children Act, now known 
as the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act—IDEA—which affirmed 
every child’s right to a free and appro-
priate public education in the least re-
strictive environment. 
Tom Gilhool’s work on PARC v. 
Pennsylvania led to another landmark 
case on behalf of people with disabil-
ities. In Pennhurst State School and 
Hospital 
v. 
Halderman, 
1981, 
Tom 
Gilhool was lead counsel for residents 
of Pennhurst State School and Hos-
pital, the residential home to almost 
3,000 people with intellectual and de-
velopmental 
disabilities. 
By 
1968, 
Pennhurst was exposed as an over-
crowded, violent, and abusive setting. 
Through Tom’s work, the right to ha-
bilitation in non-segregated settings 
was 
established. 
The 
ruling 
in 
Pennhurst v. Halderman was the fore-
runner of the 1999 Olmstead v. LC Su-
preme Court decision, establishing the 
right to treatment and services in com-
munity-based settings. Since that case, 
nearly 200,000 people have moved from 
abusive, 
segregated 
settings 
where 
they had been deprived of dignity, re-
spect, and their basic needs. Tom 
Gilhool’s work made it possible for 
millions of children and adults with in-
tellectual and developmental disabil-
ities to avoid such places. 
The cases Tom Gilhool argued laid 
much of the foundation for the passage 
of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities 
Act. Judith Gran, a long-time col-
league of Tom Gilhool at the Public In-
terest Law Center said, ‘‘Tom was the 
most effective civil rights lawyer of his 
generation. Without his vision and 
strategic gifts, [people with disabil-
ities] might not have the right to edu-
cation and the right to live in the com-
munity.’’ 
In 2012, Pennhurst v. Halderman was 
cited by Chief Justice John Roberts in 
upholding the constitutionality of key 
provisions of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act in the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
ness v. Sebelius. 
When my father was elected Gov-
ernor of Pennsylvania in 1986, he asked 
Tom to serve as Secretary of Edu-
cation. Tom worked hard for the chil-
dren of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1989. 
Thomas Gilhool’s tremendous con-
tributions to the lives and rights of 
people with disabilities and their fami-
lies are immeasurable. His accomplish-
ments will continue to benefit all peo-
ple with disabilities and inspire all who 
continue to work to protect the rights 
and freedoms of people with disabil-
ities.∑

A 
bill 
to 
amend 
the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to 
provide for the portability of profes-
sional licenses of members of the uni-
formed services and their spouses, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Armed Services. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, tomorrow 
marks an important day in our Na-
tion’s history—the birth of the U.S. Air 
Force. 
For 73 years, countless brave Amer-
ican women and men have protected 
our liberty and our homeland from the 
skies. They have embarked on air com-
bat missions, guarded our bases and 
missile sites, and undertaken heroic 
rescues. They have flown, fought, and 
won in the air on behalf of our great 
country. This year also marks another 
important anniversary in my home 
State—the 80th year of Hill Air Force 
Base’s service to that mission. 
In 1939, Congress approved the con-
struction of an air depot in Northern 
Utah. The following year, on January 
12, the surrounding community came 
together and broke ground to create 
what is now known as Hill Air Force 
Base. Ever since then, it has played an 
invaluable role in building up our Air 
Force and supporting our air men and 
women 
throughout 
World 
War 
II, 
Korea, Vietnam, and the conflicts that 
we still face today. 
Tucked 
between 
the 
beautiful 
Wasatch Mountains on the east and the 
Great Salt Lake on the west, Hill Air 
Force Base is today home to 22,000 U.S. 
military personnel. It is the largest 
single-site employer in the State of 
Utah—providing nearly $1.5 billion in 
jobs each year, with an overall eco-
nomic impact of about $3.7 billion an-
nually. Hill houses and ensures mission 
readiness for some of our best and 
brightest personnel, including the 75th 
Air Base Wing, the 388th Fighter Wing, 
and the 419th Reserve Fighter Wing. 
It is also home to the Ogden Air Lo-
gistics Complex, which repairs and 
maintains some of our most cutting- 
edge 
aircraft, 
including 
the 
F–22 
Raptor, the F–16 Fighting Falcon, the 
A–10 Thunderbolt II, the T–38 Talon, 
and, of course, the F–35A Lightening II, 
the most advanced fighter jet in the 
world. 
The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Cen-
ter on Hill has since 1959 been respon-
sible for supporting the Minuteman 
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile pro-
gram, the ground-based leg of our nu-
clear triad. 
Just a short distance west of the 
base, the Utah Test and Training 
Range contains the largest block of 
special-use airspace in the continental 
United States. The range provides an 
ideal location for the testing and eval-
uation of weapons and training grounds 
for combat, ensuring that our airmen 
are prepared to win any conflict we 
enter into with decisive and conclusive 
airpower. 
There is no question that Hill Air 
Force Base oversees vital national se-
curity assets for the U.S. Air Force. 
The Air Force and our country are bet-
ter off as a result of its existence. Yet 
there is something even more impor-
tant that makes Hill the exceptional 
place that it is, and that is its people. 
The patriotism, work ethic, and com-
munity support are unmatched any-
where else in the country—or in the 
world for that matter. 
Every commander who serves a 2- 
year rotation at Hill always says the 
same thing—that the community’s sup-
port is stronger at Hill Air Force Base 
than at any other base where any one 
of them happens to have served. 
I am proud to say that, in Utah, we 
go above and beyond to aid our mili-
tary and to support their families, as 
well we should. According to the 2019 
‘‘Support of Military Families’’ report, 
Utah ranks among the top destinations 
for military families transitioning to a 
new duty station. Two of the three 
highest ranking Air Force installations 
are in Utah—Hill Air Force Base and 
the Roland R. Wright Air National 
Guard Base in Salt Lake City. 
The key reason for this has been 
Utah’s work to improve professional li-
cense reciprocity for military spouses. 
Among the many challenges that mili-
tary families face, one of the greatest 
is that spouses working in fields re-
quiring occupational licenses often suf-
fer huge setbacks as a result of the bar-
riers put in place by these occupational 
licensing regimes in the various States. 
Faced with a 50–State patchwork 
quilt of licensing laws, these spouses 
are forced to spend thousands of dollars 
and sometimes thousands of hours on 
top of those thousands of dollars just 
to obtain licensure every single time 
they move to a new State, even if they

have previously acquired years or even 
decades of experience in licensure in 
another State. Oftentimes, by the time 
the new license in the new State and in 
the new duty station has been proc-
essed, it is already time for the family 
to move, yet again, for the next mili-
tary assignment. 
This isn’t fair. It is not right. It is 
not how we ought to treat the families 
of our brave military men and women. 
The Department of Labor estimates 
that 13 percent of military spouses are 
unemployed, and a more recent Depart-
ment of Defense study put the rate 
even higher, at 24 percent. This, need-
lessly and unjustly, burdens military 
members and their families. In some 
instances, it prevents servicemembers 
from reenlisting, and, in others, it pre-
vents spouses from entering their de-
sired fields in the first place. 
Thankfully, some States have al-
ready taken steps to move forward in 
the right direction. They have already 
stepped up to the plate to address this 
problem in a meaningful way. In fact, 
thanks to the diligent work of two 
prominent Utah lawmakers, Senator 
Todd Weiler and State Representative 
Brian Greene, my home State has been 
one of the first to allow licensure reci-
procity for military spouses as long as 
they meet certain established criteria. 
I commend Senator Weiler and Rep-
resentative Greene for their efforts, 
and I am encouraged to see other 
States following the example set by 
Utah. 
The Federal Government has a role 
to play here, too. While occupational 
licensing is a field that is generally 
controlled by the State, we have a role 
to play insofar as the activities of the 
States. The regulations imposed by the 
States end up impacting our military 
families. Military readiness and talent 
retention, as well as movement of our 
troops across the Nation and through-
out the world, fall under the oversight 
responsibilities of Congress. We at the 
national level should be doing every-
thing in our power to ensure that li-
censing laws are friendly and flexible 
and certainly not hostile to or prohibi-
tive of the activities of military 
spouses and their families. 
That is why I am introducing the 
Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act. 
This bill will simply ensure that, when 
servicemembers are relocated on mili-
tary orders, their spouses can receive 
reciprocity for professional licenses 
across State lines regardless of where 
within the United States they might be 
reassigned. 
In order to receive reciprocity under 
this bill, a license would have to be in 
good standing, according to the re-
quirements of the jurisdiction that 
issued the license in the first place, and 
the spouse must still comply with the 
State’s standards of practice, of dis-
cipline, and the fulfillment of any con-
tinuing education requirements. 
As a State function, protected under 
principles of federalism and explicitly 
by the Tenth Amendment, the bill does 
nothing to preempt the State’s rightful 
authority to set licensing standards 
within each State. 
We owe a great debt of gratitude to 
the men and women who give so much 
to protect our Nation, whether on the 
land, the seas, or in the skies. This bill 
is 
a 
simple, 
just, 
constitutionally 
sound solution that will lessen some of 
the burden placed on them. It will not 
fix all of the problems, and it will not 
make easy all of the sacrifices that are 
made by our military spouses and their 
families, but it will make some of it 
easier. That is the least we can do. 
As we commemorate the birthday of 
the Air Force and the anniversary of 
Hill Air Force Base this week, this 
bill’s passage is the least we can do for 
our military and their families. We 
need to get this passed. I invite all of 
my colleagues to join me in securing 
its immediate passage. 
By Mr. COTTON: 
S. 4609. A bill to withdraw normal 
trade relations treatment from, and 
apply certain provisions of title IV of 
the Trade Act of 1974 to, products of 
the People’s Republic of China, and to 
expand the eligibility requirements for 
products of the People’s Republic of 
China to receive normal trade relations 
treatment in the future, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, 20 years 
ago this week, Joe Biden and other 
politicians from both parties gave a 
gift to the Communist Party: perma-
nent most favored nation status. 
Permanent most favored nation sta-
tus is a trade privilege we grant most 
countries that are members of the 
World Trade Organization. It places 
lower tariffs and fewer restrictions on 
those countries’ goods. But historically 
our trade laws have treated hostile 
countries 
differently—Communist 
countries, countries that cheat on 
trade, human rights abusers; in other 
words, countries exactly like Com-
munist China. 
A few of those countries, like Cuba 
and North Korea, are denied most fa-
vored nation status outright. What few 
goods their miserable socialist econo-
mies produce face steep tariffs, sanc-
tions, and other restrictions, which is 
one reason you don’t see too many 
‘‘Made in North Korea’’ items on your 
local store shelves. 
Other countries historically have 
faced a yearly review of their trading 
privileges with the United States in 
which the President and Congress can 
assess the human rights and trade 
abuses ongoing in those countries and 
then determine whether it is in our in-
terests to grant those trading privi-
leges for another year. 
Communist China was one of those 
countries subject to yearly review—at 
least it was until 20 years ago. This 
yearly review led the spirited debates 
about 
whether 
Communist 
China 
should be stripped of its trading privi-
leges or whether it deserved a tem-
porary reprieve. It put a spotlight on 
the crimes of the Chinese Communist 
Party, and it used our market as lever-
age to advance our interests. Of course 
the Chinese Communist Party didn’t 
like that—not one bit; neither, sadly, 
did many bankers and businessmen 
here in America, who seemed a little 
more concerned about making money 
than pressuring Communist China to 
reform. This China lobby pushed hard 
to get rid of the annual vote and give 
China permanent most favored nation 
status, and 20 years ago this week, they 
finally won. 
Here is how Senator Joe Biden de-
fended his vote at the time to give a 
big gift to Communist China. He said: 
Trade concessions are all one-way in this 
deal. They drop tariffs. They drop non-mar-
ket barriers. They agree to increased protec-
tion of our intellectual property laws. 
That is what Joe Biden said at the 
time, but is that what actually hap-
pened? Were all the trade concessions 
‘‘one way,’’ as he predicted? In fact, 
they were, but not the way Joe Biden 
intended because all the trade conces-
sions ended up benefiting Beijing, 
while devastating America. 
The main consequence of that deci-
sion was to make it harder to put tar-
iffs on China in response to human 
rights and trade abuses, and it sent a 
strong signal to businesses and banks 
that China was open for business for 
good. The gold rush to China was on. 
In the two decades that followed, 
America invested more than $200 bil-
lion in China. Most of that money went 
to 
building 
factories 
and 
training 
workers over there, while our factories 
were dismantled and our workers were 
laid off. 
In the 6 years that followed that 
vote, 
manufacturing 
employment 
plunged by 18 percent as cheap Chinese 
goods flooded our market and as our 
factories 
were 
dismantled 
and 
offshored to China. 
The vote to give trade privileges to 
Communist China is just more evi-
dence of the alternate reality that poli-
ticians like Joe Biden have been living 
in for decades. There is a consistent 
pattern. They treat our enemies like 
friends and our friends like enemies, 
and the American people suffer because 
of it. 
Twenty years of getting ripped off by 
China is more than long enough. That 
is why I am introducing a bill that 
would repeal China’s permanent most 
favored nation status and return us to 
the older way, where China’s trade sta-
tus would be assessed by the President 
and Congress every year. 
My bill would make businesses think 
twice before sending more American 
jobs overseas to China, and it would 
add new human rights and trade stand-
ards that China must work toward to 
qualify for most favored nation status. 
This would put a spotlight on the Com-
munist Party’s most recent crimes, in-
cluding its use of slave labor and con-
centration camps in Turkestan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5710 
September 17, 2020 
Ultimately, repealing China’s most 
favored nation status would force reg-
ular votes in Congress, so politicians 
like Joe Biden would have to go on the 
record about whom they serve—the 
American people or the interests of the 
Chinese Communist Party.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 701—URGING 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
BURMA 
TO HOLD FREE, FAIR, INCLU-
SIVE, 
TRANSPARENT, 
PARTICIPATORY, AND CREDIBLE 
ELECTIONS ON NOVEMBER 8, 2020 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. YOUNG, 
Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. 
DURBIN, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. WYDEN, Mrs. GILLI-
BRAND, and Mr. MARKEY) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 701 
Whereas the Union Election Commission of 
Burma announced that the country will hold 
general elections on November 8, 2020; 
Whereas Burma’s previous elections were 
characterized by controversy, conflict, and 
disenfranchisement instigated by the mili-
tary of Burma (the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’), including 
in May 1990, November 2010, the April 2012 
special elections, and November 2015; 
Whereas the ongoing Tatmadaw offensives 
in Rakhine, southern Chin, Kachin, and 
northern Shan states continue to cause sig-
nificant displacement of ethnic groups, cre-
ating substantial challenges for the Union 
Election Commission to generate a verified 
comprehensive voter list and set up polling 
stations in conflict affected areas; 
Whereas provisions in the 2008 Constitu-
tion of Burma allocate 25 percent of par-
liamentary seats to the military, conferring 
exceptional powers to the Tatmadaw and 
thereby affording the Tatmadaw consider-
able power to suppress basic rights, includ-
ing freedoms of expression, assembly, and as-
sociation; 
Whereas constitutional amendments pro-
posed by the Union Parliament’s Charter 
Amendment Committee that aimed to de-
mocratize the Burmese Constitution and en-
sure equal rights, including voting rights, for 
all citizens of Burma were defeated by mili-
tary lawmakers, further enabling the mili-
tary to exercise outsized power and influence 
the country’s electoral processes; 
Whereas the National League of Democ-
racy political party has repeatedly failed to 
uphold and protect the rights of ethnic and 
religious minorities since coming to power 
in 2015; 
Whereas, as of March 31, 2020, during the 
first four years of Aung San Suu Kyi’s civil-
ian government, over 500 lawsuits against 
more than 1,000 individuals have used Bur-
ma’s legal system to repress peaceful expres-
sions critical of the Tatmadaw, civilian gov-
ernment, and Aung San Suu Kyi, resulting in 
the imprisonment of journalists, such as 
Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, 
ethnic activists, and student protestors; 
Whereas the Political Parties Registration 
Law of 2010 limits the right to form and join 
political parties only to full citizens, thereby 
severely curtailing the political participa-
tion of religious and ethnic minorities, in-
cluding Rohingya, those of Chinese and In-
dian descent, internally displaced popu-
lations across Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan 
states, and Burmese refugees in Thailand, 
Bangladesh, and elsewhere in the region, 
many of whom had citizenship documents 
canceled and who face multiple hurdles in 
gaining citizenship documentation; 
Whereas the Government of Burma insti-
tuted a blackout, that is still ongoing as of 
September 1, 2020, of mobile internet services 
and restricted internet service quality in 
Rakhine and Chin States, beginning in June 
2019, thereby inhibiting the ability to hold 
free and fair elections in these areas and fur-
ther exacerbating difficulties in aid distribu-
tion and access to potentially life-saving in-
formation since the onset of COVID–19; 
Whereas the Government of Burma con-
tinues to curtail freedom of the press and 
civil society—which are critical foundations 
for free and fair elections—as evidenced by 
government directives to block independent 
and ethnic media sites, and the anticipated 
restrictions by the Union Election Commis-
sion on voter education and election observa-
tion activities; 
Whereas Burma’s 2015 election saw the dis-
enfranchisement of significant segments of 
the population, particularly of Rohingya 
ethnicity, but also including those of Chi-
nese and Indian descent, Muslims, and other 
internally displaced persons; 
Whereas ongoing conflict in 2015 was used 
to justify the cancellation of elections in 7 
townships and more than 400 ward and vil-
lage tracts, mostly in Kachin, Shan, and 
Kayin states; 
Whereas 
Burma’s 
1982 
citizenship 
law 
stripped Rohingya of their Burmese citizen-
ship and subsequent policies rendered them 
stateless and disenfranchised, despite having 
the right to vote as recently as 2010 and abil-
ity to serve in parliament as recently as 2015; 
Whereas in 2017, the Tatmadaw commenced 
a genocide against Rohingya civilians in 
Rakhine state, causing over 740,000 Rohingya 
refugees to flee into Bangladesh, joining over 
200,000 who had been previously displaced in 
prior waves of anti-Rohingya violence, re-
sulting in more than 1,000,000 Rohingya refu-
gees not present in Burma for the election; 
Whereas the Government of Burma has not 
created conditions conducive to repatriation 
and political and electoral participation of 
Rohingya 
refugees 
and 
has 
not 
made 
progress on the most crucial of the 88 rec-
ommendations of the Rakhine Advisory 
Commission identified by Rohingya refugees 
as prerequisites to voluntary repatriation, 
including freedom of movement, provision of 
civil documentation, and a transparent path-
way to restoration of full citizenship; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw’s senior generals 
have been sanctioned by the United States 
Government for perpetrating gross human 
rights violations and are subject to ongoing 
investigations into their conduct by both the

International Criminal Court and the Inter-
national Court of Justice; and 
Whereas 
the 
United 
Nations 
Special 
Rapporteur on the Situation of Human 
Rights in Myanmar stated on July 13, 2020, 
‘‘The people of Myanmar deserve a free and 
fair election this November and this includes 
respect for the right to vote regardless of 
one’s race, ethnicity or religion, freedom of 
expression and assembly, and access to infor-
mation and a free press. It will also require 
that steps are taken now to assure that 
those in conflict areas will be able to exer-
cise their rights.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of free, fair, 
inclusive, transparent, participatory, and 
credible elections in Burma and that the 2020 
elections mark a critical juncture in Bur-
ma’s democratic process; 
(2) stands with the people of Burma in 
their ambition for sustainable peace, a gen-
uine democracy, and the realization of fun-
damental human rights for all; 
(3) calls upon the President and the Sec-
retary of State to— 
(A) support Burma’s democratic transition, 
including by emphasizing the importance to 
that transition of this election as well as of 
the Government of Burma undertaking a 
credible and sustainable process of genuine 
national and ethnic reconciliation; 
(B) support free, fair, inclusive, trans-
parent, participatory, and credible elections 
in Burma, including by working to ensure 
that the Tatmadaw and its affiliates do not 
interfere with vigorous public debate or the 
mechanism of the electoral process and that 
other government officials do not use official 
resources for electioneering; 
(C) call for a ceasefire in all Burmese 
states and localities to ensure that conflict 
is not used as an excuse to deny people the 
right to vote; 
(D) support the right to vote for internally 
displaced persons, refugees, and other Bur-
mese communities outside of Burma, with 
specific attention to the disenfranchised 
Rohingya people; 
(E) condemn any action taken by the gov-
ernment, 
political 
parties, 
military, 
or 
Union Election Commission to limit civil so-
ciety participation in the election, including 
prohibitions on voter education and election 
observation, or otherwise restrict civil soci-
ety or humanitarian space in the lead up to 
the election or in the post-election period; 
(F) ensure that United States-based social 
media companies, including Facebook, not 
allow their platforms to be used as vehicles 
for spreading misinformation or advocating 
violence or voter intimidation to suppress 
voter participation; and 
(G) ensure that the Department of State’s 
2020 Country Report on Human Rights Prac-
tices includes an extensive evaluation of the 
Burmese election, including an assessment 
of 
inclusivity, 
participation, 
and 
inter-
ference; 
(4) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment, in partnership with the international 
community, to ensure that the Union Elec-
tion Commission functions as an inde-
pendent electoral management body that es-
tablishes a regulatory framework that fos-
ters fair, open, and transparent electoral 
processes, and that the Tatmadaw publicly 
affirms that it will honor the results of such 
elections; 
(5) calls upon the Secretary of State and 
the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development to 
work with like-minded regional and inter-
national organizations, such as the Inter-
national Foundation for Electoral Systems, 
the International Institute for Democracy 
and Electoral Assistance, the Asian Network 
for Free Elections, People’s Alliance for 
Credible Elections (PACE), and the Carter 
Center, to ensure that the general elections 
in Burma meet international standards of 
free and fair elections, including by seeking 
full and unimpeded access to all aspects of 
the electoral process for international and 
domestic observers; and 
(6) calls on the President to consider sanc-
tioning individuals within the Government 
of Burma, the Tatmadaw, and among mili-
tary

ultranationalist groups, whom the United 
States Government determines undermine

AS 
‘‘NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
CRAPO, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. KING, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. COONS, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. HAWLEY, and Mrs. CAPITO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 702 
Whereas more than 3,100,000 men in the 
United States are living with prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas 1 in 9 men in the United States 
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men in the United 
States will die from prostate cancer; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
second-leading 
cause 
of 
cancer-related 
deaths among men in the United States; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates that, in 2020, 191,930 men will be diag-
nosed with, and more than 33,330 men will 
die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas 40.9 percent of newly diagnosed 
prostate cancer cases occur in men under the 
age of 65; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate 
cancer rise rapidly after age 50; 
Whereas 
African-American 
men 
suffer 
from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is 
significantly higher than that of White men 
and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men; 
Whereas having a father or brother with 
prostate cancer more than doubles the risk 
of a man developing prostate cancer, with a 
higher risk for men who have a brother with 
the disease and the highest risk for men with 
several affected relatives; 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal ex-
amination and a prostate-specific antigen 
blood test can detect the disease at the ear-
lier, more treatable stages, which could in-
crease the chances of survival for more than 
5 years to nearly 100 percent; 
Whereas only 31 percent of men survive 
more than 5 years if diagnosed with prostate 
cancer after the cancer has metastasized; 
Whereas there are typically no noticeable 
symptoms of prostate cancer in the early 
stages, making appropriate screening crit-
ical; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health will sup-
port approximately $287,000,000 in research 
projects focused specifically on prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, Congress ap-
propriated $110,000,000 for the Prostate Can-
cer Research Program of the Department of 
Defense; 
Whereas ongoing research promises further 
improvements in prostate cancer prevention, 
early detection, and treatment; and 
Whereas educating people in the United 
States, including health care providers, 
about prostate cancer and early detection 
strategies is crucial to saving the lives of 
men and preserving and protecting families: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month’’; 
(2) declares that steps should be taken— 
(A) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of screening methods for, and treat-
ment of, prostate cancer; 
(B) to encourage research— 
(i) to improve screening and treatment for 
prostate cancer; 
(ii) to discover the causes of prostate can-
cer; and 
(iii) to develop a cure for prostate cancer; 
and 
(C) to continue to consider ways to im-
prove access to, and the quality of, health 
care services for detecting and treating pros-
tate cancer; and 
(3) calls on the people of the United States, 
interest groups, and affected persons— 
(A) to promote awareness of prostate can-
cer; 
(B) to take an active role in the fight to 
end the devastating effects of prostate can-
cer on individuals, families, and the econ-
omy; and 
(C) to observe National Prostate Cancer 
Awareness Month with appropriate cere-
monies and activities.

was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 705 
Whereas, across the United States, clean 
and readily abundant forms of energy are 
powering more homes and businesses than 
ever before; 
Whereas clean energy generation is readily 
available 
from 
zero- 
and 
low-emissions 
sources; 
Whereas the clean energy sector is a grow-
ing part of the economy and has been a key 
driver of economic growth in the United 
States in recent years;

Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. 
CASSIDY, Mr. JONES, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
COONS, Mr. YOUNG, Ms. WARREN, and 
Mr. LANKFORD) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 706 
Whereas sickle cell disease (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘SCD’’) is an inherited 
blood disorder that is a major health prob-
lem in the United States and worldwide; 
Whereas SCD causes the rapid destruction 
of sickle cells, which results in multiple 
medical complications, including anemia, 
jaundice, 
gallstones, 
strokes, 
restricted 
blood flow, damaged tissue in the liver, 
spleen, and kidneys, and death; 
Whereas SCD causes acute and chronic epi-
sodes of severe pain; 
Whereas SCD affects an estimated 100,000 
individuals in the United States; 
Whereas approximately 1,000 babies are 
born with SCD each year in the United 
States, with the disease occurring in ap-
proximately 1 in 365 newborn African-Amer-
ican infants and 1 in 16,300 newborn His-
panic-American infants, and can be found in 
individuals of Mediterranean, Middle East-
ern, Asian, and Indian origin; 
Whereas more than 3,000,000 individuals in 
the United States have the sickle cell trait 
and 1 in 13 African Americans carries the 
trait; 
Whereas there is a 1 in 4 chance that a 
child born to parents who both have the 
sickle cell trait will have the disease; 
Whereas the life expectancy of an indi-
vidual with SCD is often severely limited; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has reported, based on the 
evidence available as of September 2020, that 
individuals of all ages who are affected by 
SCD are at increased risk of developing se-
vere illness from the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19); 
Whereas, while hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation 
(commonly 
known 
as 
‘‘HSCT’’) is currently the only cure for SCD 
and advances in treating the associated com-
plications of SCD have occurred, more re-
search is needed to find widely available 
treatments and cures to help individuals 
with SCD; and 
Whereas September 2020 has been des-
ignated as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness 
Month in order to educate communities 
across the United States about SCD, includ-
ing early detection methods, effective treat-
ments, and preventative care programs with 
respect to complications from SCD and con-
ditions related to SCD: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Sickle 
Cell Disease Awareness Month; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to hold appropriate programs, events, 
and activities during Sickle Cell Disease 
Awareness Month to raise public awareness 
of preventative care programs, treatments, 
and other patient services for those suffering 
from sickle cell disease, complications from 
sickle cell disease, and conditions related to 
sickle cell disease.

Ms. HASSAN (for herself, Mrs. CAP-

HOLLEN, and Mr. 
WYDEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 708 
Whereas mild traumatic brain injury, oth-
erwise known as a ‘‘concussion’’, is an im-
portant health concern for children, teens, 
and adults; 
Whereas, according to information from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion— 
(1) there are as many as 1,600,000 to 
3,800,000 sports-related concussions annually; 
(2) as many as 5,300,000 individuals live 
with a disability because of a traumatic 
brain injury; 
(3) from 2001 to 2012, the rate of emergency 
department visits for sports- and recreation- 
related injuries involving a diagnosis of con-
cussion or traumatic brain injury, alone or 
in combination with other injuries, more 
than doubled among children 19 years of age 
or younger, and, in 2012, an estimated 329,290 
children were treated in the United States 
for sports- and recreation-related injuries 
that included a diagnosis of concussion or 
traumatic brain injury; and 
(4) current data sources may only capture 
1 out of every 9 concussions across the 
United States; 
Whereas the seriousness of concussions 
should not be minimized in athletics, and re-
turn-to-play and return-to-learn protocols 
can help ensure recovery; 
Whereas concussions can affect physical, 
mental, and social health, and a greater 
awareness and understanding of proper diag-
nosis and management of concussions is crit-
ical to improved outcomes; and 
Whereas the Senate can raise awareness 
about concussions among the medical com-
munity and the public: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of September 
18, 2020, as ‘‘National Concussion Awareness 
Day’’; 
(2) recognizes that mild traumatic brain 
injury (mTBI), otherwise known as a ‘‘con-
cussion’’, is an important health concern; 
(3) commends the organizations and indi-
viduals that raise awareness about mild 
traumatic brain injury; 
(4) encourages Federal, State, and local 
policymakers to work together— 
(A) to raise awareness about the effects of 
concussions; and 
(B) to improve the understanding of proper 
diagnosis and management of concussions; 
and 
(5) encourages further research and preven-
tion efforts to ensure that fewer individuals 
experience the most adverse effects of mild 
traumatic brain injury.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
DUANE VOLUME FIRE CO. INC. 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous commitment to 
service and duty that the men and women of 
the Duane Volunteer Fire Co. Inc. have shown 
to their community for the last 50 years. 
In September of 1970, a small group of 
Duane residents established the volunteer fire 
company as a private corporation on land that 
was donated in perpetuity to the Fire Depart-
ment. Over the next two years, generous do-
nations and fundraising helped the Duane Vol-
unteer Fire Co. Inc. to become fully oper-
ational, constructing a firehouse and obtaining 
the necessary equipment. In 1972, the depart-
ment entered into a longstanding contract with 
the Town of Duane to provide firematic oper-
ations, the scope of which have expanded 
greatly today to provide many additional serv-
ices. The Duane Volunteer Fire Co. Inc. has 
highly trained and certified personnel up to the 
paramedic level that can assist in any emer-
gency. 
The Duane Volunteer Fire Co. Inc. em-
bodies the spirit of the North Country, culti-
vating a strong sense of community and lend-
ing a helping hand whenever needed. These 
volunteers not only aid their fellow neighbors 
when emergencies arise, but also provide a 
space to bring the community together. The 
firehouse serves as an ad-hoc community 
center, used for a wide variety of purposes 
such as hosting town board meetings and 
serving as the local election site as well as the 
area’s food bank. The department truly is a 
cornerstone of the community. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank the brave men and 
women, past and present, of the Duane Vol-
unteer Fire Co. Inc. for their longtime commit-
ment to safeguarding the community. I con-
gratulate them on their hard-earned achieve-
ments thus far and know they will continue to 
be a pillar of support to the town for many 
years to come.

HONORING PEYTON THOMPSON 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Peyton Thomp-
son. Peyton is a very special young man who 
has exemplified the finest qualities of citizen-
ship and leadership by taking an active part in 
the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle 
Scout. 
Peyton has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Peyton has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Pey-
ton has served his troop as Assistant Senior 
Patrol Leader and attended the Seabase High 
Adventure in the Bahamas. Peyton has also 
contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. Peyton constructed two 
raised garden beds for Pharis Farm, an ante-
bellum Clay County Historic Site outside of 
Liberty, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Peyton Thompson for his 
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

IN RECOGNITION OF 
CONSTITUTION DAY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Anniversary of Con-
stitution Day in the United States. On Sep-
tember 17, 1787, our Founding Fathers met 
and signed the most influential document that 
shaped American history, the United States 
Constitution. 
On this day every year, we celebrate Con-
stitution Day to commemorate our Founding 
Fathers working together to construct our su-
preme law of the land. The United States Con-
stitution’s first three words—‘‘We The Peo-
ple’’—affirm that the government of the United 
States exists to serve its citizens. Collectively, 
the U.S. Constitution is not only the source of 
all government powers, but places limitations 
on the government that protects the funda-
mental unalienable rights of U.S. Citizens. 
Today we honor Constitution Day to ensure 
all people broaden their knowledge on how 
the Constitution has shaped our history and 
each and every one of our lives. Knowing the 
content of the U.S. Constitution is the key to 
making sure that we operate within the param-
eters established by our Founding Fathers. It 
ensures that the Constitution remains a living, 
breathing document and the bedrock of our 
democracy. Only by knowing our freedoms 
and rights are we able to safeguard them from 
attempts to dilute them. Only by knowing the 
boundaries of what’s permissible can we pre-
vent threats to the more perfect union that 
was created over 200 years ago. All laid out 
for us, together today, we celebrate unity, 
freedom, and democracy. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in celebrating Constitution Day in 
the United States of America. 
CELEBRATING REVEREND DOCTOR 
GREGORY M. HOWARD 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to honor and rec-
ognize Rev. Dr. Gregory M. Howard, a pastor, 
academic, and author, who has dedicated his 
life to promoting community spirit in others. 
Dr. Howard has shown dedication and pas-
sion for spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
through his many roles as a servant leader. 
The Commonwealth of Virginia is indebted to 
him for his years of service to our academic 
and religious institutions, including his time as 
Interim Dean and Associate Professor of Hom-
iletics and Practical Theology at the Samuel 
DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia 
Union University, and as immediate past presi-
dent of the Baptist General Convention of Vir-
ginia. He has shared his experiences and 
deep knowledge with us through his writing, 
including authoring Black Sacred Rhetoric: 
The Gospel According to Religious Folk Talk 
and Voices Crying Out in the Wilderness: 
Theological Reflections Where Context Mat-
ters. 
Dr. Howard’s leadership within the Black 
church has advanced the cause of social jus-
tice, and I am confident that he will continue 
to lead that fight for years to come. He con-
tinuously motivates us to work with humble 
devotion to improve the lives of those around 
us. I have no doubt that he will continue to in-
spire generations of young people to pursue a 
life of service through faith, community, and 
love.

IN HONOR OF MAJOR GENERAL 
KENNETH D. JONES 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and honor Major General Kenneth 
D. Jones for his 38 remarkable years of lead-
ership and dedicated service in the United 
States Army. 
General Jones was born and raised in Braz-
os County and now calls Iola, Texas home. In 
1980, General Jones graduated from Texas 
A&M University, where he was a member of 
the Corps of Cadets’ V–1 Vipers. After grad-
uation, General Jones chose to serve his 
country and was commissioned as a Second 
Lieutenant, Ordnance Corps. General Jones 
began his career as a Soldier in the 82nd Air-
borne Division during the Cold War, later com-
manding at the company, battalion, brigade, 
and major command levels. Throughout his 
career, General Jones spent over 35 months 
deployed overseas in Southwest Asia. His de-
ployment includes Operations Iraqi Freedom/

Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn, and Enduring Free-
dom/Spartan Shield. 
During his time in the Army, General Jones 
also found time to further his education and 
training, earning a master’s degree from the 
United States War College in 2008. He served 
in multiple flag officer assignments across the 
country. After he earned the rank of Army Re-
serve two-star general, General Jones was 
promoted to Commander of the 81st Readi-
ness Division in 2017. In this position, General 
Jones was responsible for ensuring his units— 
a group amounting to 50,000 soldiers—were 
fully trained throughout the Southeastern 
United States region. 
During his career, General Jones exempli-
fied excellence and service. He has earned 
multiple decorations in his career, including 
Legion of Merit Medals, Bronze Star Medals, 
and Meritorious Service Medals, to name a 
few. In his civilian career, General Jones 
worked for Hallmark Cards Inc. for 28 years 
as a Plant Engineering Manager before decid-
ing to return to his roots in Texas, where he 
works for the family insurance business in 
Bryan as the Business Development and 
Human Capital Manager. 
It is an honor to celebrate General Jones’ 
leadership and unwavering commitment to our 
great country. I am proud to join his wife 
Cheryl, their two daughters, and two grand-
children to thank him for a long, devoted ca-
reer of service and wish him well as he begins 
this next chapter of life.

HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, in 
regards to a technical question from some of 
my colleagues, H.R. 1668 will set the min-
imum security policies and vulnerability disclo-
sure guidance for the procurement of govern-
ment Internet of Things devices. To ensure 
that devices do not slip through the cracks, 
Section 7 of this bill includes a simplified ac-
quisition threshold provision. The intent of this 
section is to ensure that all contracts, even 
those below the simplified acquisition thresh-
old, are subject to the standards and guide-
lines developed under section 4 or the guide-
lines published under section 5.

TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH T. 
MCELVEEN, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dear friend and the 
retiring Mayor of my hometown of Sumter, 
South Carolina. Joseph T. McElveen, Jr. is a 
dedicated public servant and an ardent advo-
cate for Sumter. His leadership will be missed, 
but I know he will continue to be an active part 
of his beloved community. 
Joe McElveen and I share the hometown of 
Sumter and are blessed to have had entrepre-
neurial parents to teach us. His father, John, 
owned a bicycle shop and ice cream parlor on 
Liberty Street across from my mother’s beauty 
shop. The two of them created a partnership 
that resulted in my brothers and me spending 
our summers selling his ice cream from our 
mother’s push carts in our neighborhood. I am 
grateful that the relationship between our fami-
lies developed into a lifelong friendship be-
tween us. 
Joe attended public schools in Sumter and 
graduated from The Citadel in 1968. He was 
a Gold Star student and a Distinguished Air 
Force Student and Graduate. Following col-
lege graduation, Joe went on to attend the 
University of South Carolina Law School, 
where he served on the Editorial Board of the 
South Carolina Law Review and published two 
articles. He graduated and was admitted to 
the Bar in 1971. 
After law school, Joe served in the U.S. Air 
Force as an administrative officer for the 728th 
Tactical Fighter Support Squadron. When his 
active duty service ended, he continued in re-
serve duty as a Staff Judge Advocate until 
1977. During that time, Joe joined the Bryan 
Law Firm and became a partner in 1975. His 
legal career focused on family law and work-
ers’ compensation. 
Joe served on the House of Delegates and 
Board of Governors for the South Carolina Bar 
Association, and as a board member of the 
Workplace Litigation Group. He also received 
the Gold Compleat Lawyer Award by the 
South Carolina School of Law in 1996. 
In addition to his success as a lawyer, Joe 
is also dedicated to serving his community. He 
has served on the Sumter County Drug Abuse 
Council and as a member of the City of Sum-
ter Zoning Board of Adjustments and the City/ 
County Planning Commission. He has also 
served as president of the Sumter Jaycees, 
the Sumter Optimist Club and the Greater 
Sumter Chamber of Commerce. He also 
served on the board of the Sumter Family 
YMCA and was recognized for his service by 
the March of Dimes and the Heart Associa-
tion. 
Joe has also held elective office. He was 
elected to Sumter City Council for two years, 
serving from 1984 to 1986. In 1986, he began 
representing Sumter County in the South 
Carolina House, where he served on the Judi-
ciary and Rules Committee. He also served 
two terms as Majority Leader and left the 
State Legislature in 1996. In 2000, Joe ran for 
and was elected Mayor of our hometown. 
With his retirement this year as Mayor of 
Sumter, Joe leaves as the longest serving 
Mayor in the city’s history. He also leaves a 
legacy of making the City of Sumter a better 
place. I was pleased to work with the Mayor 
to secure federal funding to renovate an old 
warehouse into a much-needed Intermodal 
Transportation Center. Later the Regional 
Transportation Authority honored me by nam-
ing the Center in my honor and I was present 
for its dedication in 2008. We also worked 
closely together to bring resources and serv-
ices to economically distressed communities 
through three HOPE (Harvest Opportunity and 
Promoting Empowerment) Centers in the fed-
erally designated Sumter Columbia Empower-
ment Zone. 
As Mayor, Joe also oversaw a revitalization 
of Sumter’s historic downtown. The Sumter 
Opera House was restored as a center for en-
tertainment, a new Public Safety Complex was 
opened, and public parks including Memorial 
Park, Palmetto Park and Swan Lake Iris Gar-
dens have been upgraded. During his tenure, 
he encouraged Leadership in Energy and En-
vironmental Design (LEED) certification in new 
construction and renovations to public build-
ings to promote sustainability. 
He also expanded sports and recreational 
opportunities by opening the City of Sumter 
Aquatics Center and the Palmetto Tennis Cen-
ter. Joe also led the initiative to decrease va-
cant properties by more than 22-percent and 
developed the PRIDE program to help 564 
owners clean up blighted properties. His ef-
forts to improve Sumter, were recognized 
when the City was recognized as a Top 20 fi-
nalist in the 2019 All American City Competi-
tion hosted by the National League of Cities. 
Joe is a longtime member of The United 
States Conference of Mayors (USCM) and 
was elected to the 28-member USCM Advi-
sory Board. He also serves as Chair of the 
Veteran Affairs Task Force and Vice Chair of 
the Membership Committee. 
He is married to the former Kathy Watson. 
They have two children, Thomas (Bronwyn) 
and Kate Price (Nick), and two grandchildren 
Adelaide and Joe McElveen. The family at-
tends First Presbyterian Church, where Joe 
has served as a deacon and an elder. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me wishing Mayor Joe 
McElveen a happy and healthy retirement 
from public life. He has demonstrated through 
this lifetime of service that he is motivated by 
his love of his community and its people. He 
has given his time and his talents to ensure 
Sumter continues to grow and thrive. It is a 
better place because of his service, and that 
is a tremendous legacy of which he should be 
extremely proud.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE 
NFL 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with my fellow representative, Mr. Bob Gibbs, 
to wish the National Football League a happy 
100th birthday. One hundred years ago today, 
15 people met in an automobile showroom in 
Canton, Ohio to form what would become the 
National Football League. From these humble 
beginnings, the NFL has grown into a pre-
eminent American sports league, comprised of 
32 teams from 22 states across the country. 
Over its first 100 years, the NFL has be-
come a fixture in American life. The league is 
an American institution that brings together in-
dividuals of all ages, races, and backgrounds 
through a common enthusiasm for and appre-
ciation for the game of football. Through good 
times and bad, the NFL has consistently re-
flected the spirit of the American people, dis-
playing resilience, optimism, and resolve 
through periods of war, economic distress, 
natural disasters, and the current pandemic. 
Last season, the NFL concluded the celebra-
tion of its 100th season with a thrilling Super 
Bowl championship that was viewed by over 
100 million Americans. 
Although the league celebrated its 100th 
season in 2019, the League’s 100th birthday

is a historic day as well. Today, in an effort to 
commemorate this momentous occasion. my 
Cleveland Browns will host the Cincinnati Ben-
gals in a classic rivalry game, known as the 
‘‘Battle of Ohio’’. The game will highlight the 
formation of the league and its humble roots 
in Canton, honor the more than 25,000 play-
ers who have played in the league, and show-
case the work the NFL is doing to ensure its 
second century is just as successful as the 
first. 
We, therefore, recognize the National Foot-
ball League on its 100th birthday, and wish 
the league all the best as it embarks into its 
second century as the foremost steward of 
‘‘America’s Game.’’ Go Browns!

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JOHN KUSMITCH 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life and service of John 
Kusmitch of Kingsford, Michigan. Through his 
extreme courage and selflessness, John has 
become an indispensable part of the state of 
Michigan. 
John enlisted in the United States Army in 
August of 1949 at just 18. During the Korean 
War, he served in the 25th Infantry Division as 
a motor transport operator, and was respon-
sible for supervising and operating vehicles to 
transport personnel and cargo. The vital work 
of motor transport operators like John were 
the backbone of our military operations during 
this conflict—providing advanced mobility both 
on and off the battlefield. In April of 1951, 
John was captured by hostile forces and en-
dured 27 months of harsh conditions as a 
Prisoner of War. 
Observed annually on the third Friday of 
September, National POW/MIA Recognition 
Day honors those who were Prisoners of War 
and those who are still Missing in Action in 
service to their nation. We owe the men and 
women in uniform who were captured, miss-
ing, or unaccounted for a debt which can 
never be repaid. By coming together to honor 
those who stood up to defend and to serve, 
the people of Michigan’s First District can en-
sure that the service and sacrifice of those in 
uniform is never forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the service of John Kusmitch. Michiganders 
can take immense pride in knowing that the 
First District is home to such a selfless indi-
vidual. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
John all the best in his future endeavors.

FLORIDA INVENTORS HALL OF 
FAME 2020 INDUCTEES 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the eight inventors who have 
been recognized as the 2020 Inductees of the 
Florida Inventors Hall of Fame. To be named 
as an Inductee, these inventors were nomi-
nated by their peers nationwide and have un-
dergone the scrutiny of the Florida Inventors 
Hall of Fame Selection Committee. As a re-
sult, their innovations have been identified as 
significantly impacting the quality of life, eco-
nomic development, and welfare of their com-
munities, the residents of Florida, and the 
United States. 
The Florida Inventors Hall of Fame was 
founded in 2013 at the University of South 
Florida. It was recognized by the Florida Sen-
ate with Senate Resolution 1756, adopted on 
April 30, 2014. Its mission is to encourage in-
dividuals of all backgrounds to strive toward 
the betterment of Florida and society through 
continuous, 
groundbreaking 
innovation 
by 
celebrating the incredible scientific work that 
has been or is being accomplished in Florida 
and by its citizens. 
Nomination to the Florida Inventors Hall of 
Fame is open to all Florida inventors (living or 
dead) who are or have been residents of Flor-
ida. The nominee must be a named inventor 
on a patent issued by the United States Pat-
ent and Trademark Office. The impact of the 
inventor and his or her invention should be 
significant to society, and the invention should 
have been commercialized, utilized, or led to 
important innovations. 
The 2020 Inductees of the Florida Inventors 
Hall of Fame are: 
Christopher Batich: University of Florida 
Professor of materials science and engineer-
ing and biomedical engineering, who devel-
oped groundbreaking treatments in patient 
care, most notably the anti-bacterial surface 
treatment material, Bioguard, which is used as 
the standard of care for advanced wound 
dressing and bacterial barriers in hospitals and 
healthcare facilities. 
Nicholas Bodor: Founder and CEO of Bodor 
Laboratories, University of Florida Professor 
Emeritus and prolific inventor whose innova-
tions in drug discovery established the field of 
retrometabolic drug design and led him to de-
velop a portfolio of novel drugs to treat numer-
ous inflammatory disease processes. 
Harvey Firestone (1868–1938): Founder of 
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company whose 
pioneering innovations revolutionized the com-
mercial rubber industry, and who advanced 
scientific research in Florida and co-founded 
the Edison Botanic Research Corporation to 
develop a domestic source of natural rubber. 
Leslie Kramer: Vice President of Engineer-
ing and Manufacturing at TaiLor Made Pros-
thetics; scientist, engineer and entrepreneur 
whose 
long 
career 
in 
industry 
led 
to 
groundbreaking innovations in composite ma-
terials, military defense applications and most 
notably an advanced carbon-fiber composite 
prosthetic foot that has improved the lives of 
amputees. 
Israel Morejon: Founder and President of In-
tegrated Engineering Technology whose in-
ventions have provided innovative solutions 
across multiple industries, most notably state- 
of-the-art LED lighting technologies, Nano pro-
jectors, wireless modem technology, optical to-
mography for cancer detection systems, and 
cutting-edge HVAC Load Reduction tech-
nology. 
Joshua Rokach: Florida Institute of Tech-
nology Professor who was the first to syn-
thesize major inflammatory triggers respon-
sible for asthma, allergies, and inflammatory 
bowel disease, which revolutionized medical 
research in allergy and inflammation and led 
him to develop a number of groundbreaking 
drug discoveries, including Singulair and 
Flexeril. 
Jean-Franc¸ois Rossignol: Co-Founder and 
Chief Medical & Scientific Officer of Romark 
Laboratories and University of South Florida 
Affiliate Professor of Medicine whose break-
throughs in treatments for parasitic diseases 
led to his discovery of thiazolides, a new class 
of antiparasitic agents, later discovered as a 
new class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs 
also used in the fight against novel infectious 
diseases. 
Christine Schmidt: University of Florida Pro-
fessor and Chair of the J. Crayton Pruitt Fam-
ily Department of Biomedical Engineering 
whose pioneering research in biomaterials 
science 
led 
to 
her 
development 
of 
decellularization techniques used in Avance 
Nerve Graft, a biochemically processed nerve 
graft that benefits patients with peripheral 
nerve damage. 
Innovation and invention are the building 
blocks of our nation. I applaud these highly 
accomplished individuals and the organiza-
tions that support them in their quest to 
change the world in ways that truly benefit hu-
manity. It is because of the perseverance of 
these inventors that future generations are en-
couraged to reach beyond their limits and 
push the boundaries of innovation.

HONORING THE BRAVE SERVICE 
OF CHARLES E. COOPER OF TEN-
NESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Army Private First 
Class Charles E. Cooper for his distinguished 
service to this nation. 
PFC Cooper served honorably in the United 
States Army during World War II, beginning in 
1942 at the age of 25. He was sent to Com-
pany K, 3rd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment of 
the 4th Infantry Division, participating in rig-
orous training exercises that included amphib-
ious assaults that would later be employed for 
the D-Day assault. On that fateful day, June 6, 
1944, the 4th Infantry Division crossed the 
English Channel to the front lines of the War, 
assaulting a German-held beach under heavy 
enemy fire.

PFC Cooper’s regiment was one of the first 
surface-borne Allied units to hit the beaches at 
Normandy, providing much-needed relief to 
the 82nd Airborne Division. The division’s ad-
vancements took the Cotentin peninsula and 
resulted in the capture of Cherbourg. They 
also slowed the German Seventh Army’s 
march toward Avranches, ultimately leading to 
the liberation of the Paris. 
The 4th Division later crossed into Belgium 
and broke through the Siegfried Line, slowly 
progressing through the heart of Germany. On 
November 6, 1944, a severe, month-long bat-
tle broke out at the fortified Hurtgen Forrest, 
resulting in PFC Cooper being mortally 
wounded by enemy fire. He died of his 
wounds on November 19, 1944, at the age of 
27. 
PFC Cooper will forever be memorialized as 
an American hero. We remember him for his 
exemplary service and courageous spirit as he 
modelled 
for 
servicemembers 
everywhere 
what it means to sacrifice. As a monument of 
gratitude to his service, Wayne County in Ten-
nessee has chosen to dedicate a bridge in his 
honor. On behalf of the United States Con-
gress, I wish to pay tribute to this American 
hero who made the ultimate sacrifice in our 
nation’s hour of need.

RECOGNIZING USHER SYNDROME 
AWARENESS DAY 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Usher syndrome and, in 
particular, to recognize the Usher Syndrome 
Coalition, a nonprofit organization based in 
Massachusetts that is building and connecting 
the global Usher syndrome community to help 
speed the search for a cure. This Saturday, 
September 19, 2020, is Usher Syndrome 
Awareness Day. 
Usher syndrome is a rare genetic disease 
that affects at least 25,000 people in the 
United States. It causes deafness or hearing 
loss from birth, and retinal disease that slowly 
and progressively leads to blindness. Cur-
rently, there are no treatments or cure for 
Usher syndrome—but that can change with 
awareness and support. Finding a cure has 
never been more urgent or more achievable. 
Some of the world’s most innovative re-
searchers are leading efforts to develop treat-
ments for Usher syndrome at institutions 
across the country including in my home state 
of Massachusetts. Scientists at Massachusetts 
Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School and 
Boston Children’s Hospital are pursuing prom-
ising paths to treatment, including a stem cell 
therapy trial and gene therapy strategies to 
treat the vision loss and hearing loss caused 
by Usher syndrome. 
As a nation, we need to do more to find a 
cure. Usher syndrome not only impacts our 
families but our communities, our health care 
system, our educational system, and our 
economy. For the past six years, federal 
spending on Usher syndrome has remained 
flat. This must change if there is to be any real 
progress toward finding a cure. 
Targeted research supported by sufficient 
funding and serious agency attention are crit-
ical components to finding a cure. The 
COVID–19 pandemic and the daily challenges 
facing the Usher syndrome community could 
not be more pressing and finding a cure more 
paramount. 
I am proud to recognize the work of the 
Usher Syndrome Coalition, and the commit-
ment to finding a cure for Usher syndrome. I 
stand with those who suffer from Usher syn-
drome and hope with the dedicated efforts of 
the Usher Syndrome Coalition, there will soon 
be a cure.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH SEA-
SON OF THE NATIONAL FOOT-
BALL LEAGUE (NFL) 
HON. BOB GIBBS 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
with my fellow Representative Tim Ryan (OH– 
13) to wish the National Football League a 
happy 100th birthday. One hundred years ago 
today, 15 people met in an automobile show-
room in Canton, Ohio to form what would be-
come the National Football League. From 
these humble beginnings, the NFL has grown 
into a preeminent American sports league, 
comprised of 32 teams from 22 states across 
the country. 
Over its first 100 years, the NFL has be-
come a fixture in American life. The league is 
an American institution that brings together in-
dividuals of all ages, races, and backgrounds 
through a common enthusiasm for and appre-
ciation for the game of football. Through good 
times and bad, the NFL has consistently re-
flected the spirit of the American people, dis-
playing resilience, optimism, and resolve 
through periods of war, economic distress, 
natural disasters, and the current pandemic. 
Last season, the NFL concluded the celebra-
tion of its 100th season with a thrilling Super 
Bowl championship that was viewed by over 
100 million Americans. 
Although the league celebrated its 100th 
season in 2019, the League’s 100th birthday 
is a historic day as well. Today, in an effort to 
commemorate this momentous occasion, the 
Cleveland Browns will host the Cincinnati Ben-
gals in a classic rivalry game, known as the 
‘‘Battle of Ohio’’. The game will highlight the 
formation of the league and its humble roots 
in Canton, honor the more than 25,000 play-
ers who have played in the league, and show-
case the work the NFL is doing to ensure its 
second century is just as successful as the 
first. 
We, therefore, recognize the National Foot-
ball League on its 100th birthday, and wish 
the league all the best as it embarks into its 
second century as the foremost steward of 
‘‘America’s Game.’’

HONORING THE FALLEN CLEVE-
LAND CITY POLICE OFFICERS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, it is with 
terrible sadness and grief that I rise today, for 
in my district the Cleveland community is lay-
ing to rest two Cleveland City Police Officers, 
whose fates were met far too early. 
Detective James Skernivitz, 53, was working 
an undercover drug operation when he and 
his informant, Scott Dingess, 50, were am-
bushed and killed, a tragic incident marking 
Detective Skernivitz as the first on-duty officer 
to be fatally shot in Cleveland in more than a 
decade. Officer Skernivitz was a devoted hus-
band to his wife Kristen, and father to Mat-
thew, Bayleigh and Peyton. Officer Skernivitz 
was a brother, a son, and a friend to many. 
We are also mourning the terrible loss of 
Cleveland Police Officer Nick Sabo, 39, who 
was found dead as a result of a tragic and 
sudden suicide. Officer Sabo will be remem-
bered as a devoted husband to his wife

Brienne, beloved father to his four children 
Isaiah, Elijah, Camryn, and Kinsley, and treas-
ured son, brother, friend and fellow officer. 
The sudden deaths of Detective Skernivitz 
and Officer Sabo serve as a constant re-
minder of the dangers and stresses put on 
public safety officers every single day. Both 
men lived and died as heroes and the Cleve-
land community will never forget their service 
and sacrifices. 
My sincerest condolences and prayers are 
with their families, the Cleveland Police De-
partment, and the entire Cleveland community 
during this difficult time. 
In their memory, I will request that American 
flags be hoisted over the U.S. Capitol in their 
memory and be presented to their families as 
a token of our everlasting gratitude for their ul-
timate sacrifices to Protect and Serve.

CELEBRATING HISPANIC 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and celebrate His-
panic Heritage Month. Observed from Sep-
tember 15th to October 15th, Hispanic Herit-
age Month honors those of Hispanic heritage, 
praises the extraordinary contributions that 
they have made to our society, and reaffirms 
our commitment to protecting their culture. 
Hispanic Americans are among the fastest 
growing ethnic groups in the United States. 
For evidence, simply turn to my home state of 
Texas. In the 30th District alone, Hispanic 
Americans account for nearly 40 percent of 
my constituents. The inclusion of their voices 
and values in the community make my district, 
and the United States, stronger as whole. 
Sadly, as a result of systemic inequalities, 
Hispanic Americans face a higher risk of con-
tracting and dying from the coronavirus. Addi-
tionally, many have been forced to choose be-
tween returning to work in unsafe environ-
ments or losing their jobs—quite literally a 
choice of life or death. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Hispanic 
Heritage Month, let us be mindful of the pain 
this community has felt these past few 
months, and continue to push for the passage 
of bills—such as the HEROES Act, the 
DREAM and Promise Act, and Raise the 
Wage Act—all of which would greatly improve 
the lives of our Hispanic brothers and sisters.

HONORING CONSTITUTION WEEK, 
SEPT. 17 THROUGH 23 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Constitution Week, which is ob-
served during the week of September 17 
through 23. This week is intended to com-
memorate the adoption of the United States 
Constitution, a document that has embraced 
freedom and been a shining light of democ-
racy since its adoption in 1787. 
In 1787, at a time when it was unheard of, 
the founding fathers set out to establish a 
bold, new way of life that warded against gov-
ernmental tyranny and instead embraced free-
dom and democracy. The founders sought to 
replace the flawed and insufficient Articles of 
Confederation with a new document that bet-
ter encapsulated a balance between sov-
ereignty and cohesion to guide the fledgling 
country. The framing process itself was gruel-
ing, entailing several hour-long debates inside 
of a hot room in Philadelphia, during which the 
framers clashed over ideas of sovereignty, dis-
tribution of power, and individual liberties. Out 
of this grueling process eventually arose the 
United States Constitution, which establishes 
the United States government and outlines its 
relationship to the people, along with other 
rules and inalienable rights guaranteed to its 
citizens. 
The Constitution serves as an example of 
American tenacity and embodies our commit-
ment to freedom, democracy, and honor. 
Since its adoption in 1787, dozens of other 
countries have followed suit and have adopted 
measures to enhance freedom and democracy 
in their own lands. During this celebratory 
week, we take a moment to pay respect to 
this document, which has had such positive 
benefits for human civilization, both domesti-
cally and abroad. 
I ask that all Members join me in recog-
nizing Constitution Week.

TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN W. 
MATTHEWS, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dear friend and a true 
public servant. Senator John Wesley Mat-
thews, Jr. is retiring after 46 years of service 
in the South Carolina State Legislature. He is 
renowned for his commitment to education 
and job creation especially in Berkeley, Cal-
houn, Colleton, Dorchester and Orangeburg 
counties, which he proudly serves. His leader-
ship and tireless dedication will truly be 
missed. 
John, a son of South Carolina, was born to 
Reverend John Wesley, Sr. and Victoria Wil-
liams Matthews. He is a graduate of South 
Carolina 
State 
College 
(now 
University), 
Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, and 
Lincoln Electrical Institute. 
John began his career as a public-school 
teacher and rose to become a school prin-
cipal. He was also a small business owner. 
These experiences led him to seek elective of-
fice and he ran for the South Carolina State 
House. He served as a State Representative 
from 1975 to 1984, when he ran for the State 
Senate. He has held the Senate District No. 
39 seat since 1985. 
While in the Senate, John served as a 
member of the Senate Education, Finance, 
Banking & Insurance Committee, the Agri-
culture & Natural Resources Committee, and 
the Ethics and Interstate Cooperation Com-
mittee. He currently serves as the Assistant 
Minority Leader in the State Senate and as 
Chairman of the Orangeburg County Legisla-
tive Delegation. He has previously served as 
Chairman of the South Carolina Legislative 
Black Caucus and as a member of the South-
ern Regional Education Board, the Education 
Oversight Committee, a member of the 2016 
Democratic National Platform Committee and 
a member of the Governor’s Middle Grades 
Task Force. 
In 2004, I was proud to be on hand, when 
the Orangeburg County Council named a 500- 
acre site at the intersections of U.S. Highways 
301 and 176 the John W. Matthews Industrial 
Park. Our alma mater, South Carolina State 
also honored John in 2006 with the naming of 
the John W. Matthews, Jr. 1890 Extension 
Building. Last year, the South Carolina Senate 
unveiled a portrait of their colleague, currently 
the longest serving South Carolina State legis-
lator. The portrait hangs in the Chamber. 
These honors are richly deserved and rep-
resent the impact that John has had on his 
native state. 
In addition to his service in the General As-
sembly, John has served his community in 
many other capacities. He has served as a 
member of the South Carolina Education As-
sociation, the Orangeburg County Education 
Association, the Clemson University Board of 
Visitors, the Medical University of South Caro-
lina Board of Trustees, the Winthrop Board of 
Visitors, the Human Affairs Commission Board 
of Trustees, the Voorhees College Board of 
Trustees, and the Claflin University Capital 
Campaign Steering Committee. 
John has received numerous awards over 
the years including induction into the South 
Carolina Black Hall of Fame and being named 
Minority Business Advocate of the Year by the 
U.S. Small Business Administration and South 
Carolina Primary Health Care Legislator of the 
Year. He is also a recipient of the South Caro-
lina Independent Colleges & Universities Leg-
islative Champion Award, the Wilkins Legisla-
tive Leadership Award, the Ernest Finney 
Chairmen’s Award, the Orangeburg Chapter 
NAACP 
Exceptional 
Legislative 
Service 
Award, the Congressman Clyburn and Con-
gressman John Spratt Public Service Award, 
the SC Alliance for Mobile Infrastructure Elect-
ed Official of the Year Award and the National 
Trends and Services Award of the Orangeburg 
Chapter of the Links, Inc. 
He has received honorary doctorates from 
South Carolina State University, the College of 
Charleston and the Medical University of 
South Carolina. 
John was married to the late Geraldine 
Hillard Matthews, and the couple had five chil-
dren. He attends Pineville United Methodist 
Church and is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha 
Fraternity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and our col-
leagues join me in celebrating the tremendous 
service John W. Matthews has provided to the 
State of South Carolina. He embodies the true 
definition of a servant leader, and his longevity 
in the South Carolina General Assembly has 
left a lasting mark on the State and its citi-
zens. We are all better for his service, and I 
know he will continue to serve his community 
for years to come.

CONSTITUTION DAY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today is the 233rd anniversary of the 
signing of the U.S. Constitution by our Found-
ing Fathers in Independence Hall in Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania. The seven articles of the 
Constitution give clarity to our three branches 
of government: the executive, legislative, and 
judicial branches, and explains the separating 
of duties for each. 
As an attorney, a retired member of the 
United States Armed Forces, a Member of 
Congress, and a member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, I appreciate the Constitu-
tion each day and hold fast to how the Found-
ing Fathers envisioned limited government to 
provide for expanded freedom. I encourage all 
Americans to read and discuss the U.S. Con-
stitution today with family, friends, coworkers, 
and others in honor and celebration of Con-
stitution Day. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

RECOGNIZING DALE BRIGHT’S DIS-
TINGUISHED SERVICE TO LABOR-
ERS 242 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to rise to recognize Dale 
Bright on his many years of service as a la-
borer and then as the Political Director of La-
borers Local Union 242 and congratulate him 
on his retirement. 
My staff and I were lucky to have the privi-
lege of working with Dale on labor rights for 
several years. Dale has always been a cham-
pion of workers’ rights and through his advo-
cacy he has been able to improve the lives of 
countless workers in Washington. Dale has 
fought relentlessly to ensure everyone has ac-
cess to a fair and equal workplace including 
living wages, good benefits, and more. He 
was instrumental in implementing Community 
Workforce Agreements and apprenticeship uti-
lization throughout the region. This work has 
had 
a 
profound 
impact 
on 
historically 
marginalized communities. These programs 
have proved to be incredibly successful and 
helped many people start union careers. 
Dale continually demonstrated time and 
again that he is a community builder and pas-
sionate leader. Dale encouraged and helped 
facilitate civic engagement and voter registra-
tion among members of the Laborers Local 
Union 242. His leadership, knowledge, and 
personal efforts greatly contributed to one of 
the strongest labor unions in the country. The 
thoughtfulness, work ethic, and enthusiasm 
Dale brought to the Laborers as Political Di-
rector will be deeply missed by all. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dale Bright for his 
dedicated service to the Laborers 242 where 
he never stopped working to advance the 
rights of workers, and I wish him a happy re-
tirement. 
HONORING DR. HELEN LEVINE 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Helen Levine, the Regional Vice 
Chancellor for External Affairs at the Univer-
sity of South Florida St. Petersburg (USFSP), 
for her 14 years of service to the USF system 
and for being a remarkable and powerful force 
for good in the Pinellas community. 
During a tenure that spanned multiple cam-
pus administrations, Dr. Levine used her posi-
tion to fight for the advancement of higher 
education. From her work championing the 
construction of the historic Kate Tiedemann 
College of Business to her advocacy on behalf 
of the internationally recognized La Florida 
Project, which tells the story of Spanish Flor-
ida, Dr. Levine has changed many lives for the 
better. She is someone who has long lived up 
to the ideals of bipartisanship and civility, 
working across the aisle with city councils, the 
state legislature, and Congress to secure 
funds for research, scholarship, and a more

Madam Speaker, to speak for just one 
minute on the full legacy of Dr. Levine is im-
possible. She is a groundbreaking leader, a 
champion for education, and a role model for 
all who seek to improve the lives of others in 
their community. As she retires from her sen-

wish her the best in all her future endeavors 
both personally and as a valued member of 
our community.

HONORING 
JUDGE 
LISA 
BLOCH 
RODWIN 
FOR 
HER 
DEDICATED 
SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Erie County Family 
Court Judge Lisa Bloch Rod win as she retires 
from the bench after over thirty years of public 
service. Throughout her career as a judge, 
and previously as a prosecutor, Judge Bloch 
Rodwin’s dedication and ingenuity helped se-
cure the promise of equal justice before the 
law more fully for victims of domestic violence 
and others to whom it had previously too often 
been denied. 
As an assistant district attorney, Judge 
Bloch Rodwin was the founder of one of the 
first domestic violence bureaus in a prosecu-
tor’s office nationally. Her work helped change 
the culture of the criminal justice system in 
Western New York; in important ways Judge 
Bloch Rodwin’s efforts led the re-shaping of 
that system to more comprehensively address 
the scourge of domestic violence and related 
crimes with the vigor and the tenacity that jus-
tice requires. 
After her appointment to the bench in 2007, 
and subsequent re-elections, Judge Bloch 
Rodwin continued this important work, devel-
oping and expanding programs to aid victims 
of domestic abuse and other crimes in under- 
served communities. She was the founding 
board chair of the Erie County Family Justice 
Center, as well as a founder of the Alexa 
Foundation, which serves child abuse and 
sexual assault survivors. We in Western New 
York have not been the only beneficiaries of 
Judge Bloch Rodwin’s good work; she has 
been generous in providing the benefit of her 
widely sought-after expertise nation-wide to 
professionals in the criminal justice system, to 
national media outlets and to academics. It is 
appropriate that as a result of her work, Judge 
Bloch Rodwin has been the recipient of nu-
merous national, regional and local awards 
and honors. 
I ask my honorable colleagues to join me in 
thanking Judge Bloch Rodwin for her exem-
plary and courageous efforts, and in recog-
nizing her extraordinary career and accom-
plishments. In specific, tangible ways, Western 
New York and the United States have become 
more just because of the Judge’s good work, 
and we are all in her debt.

HONORING REVEREND LONNIE 
AND ELISHA MITCHELL 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the lifelong 
service of Reverend Lonnie and Elisha Mitch-
ell. As the Pastor and First Lady of Bethel Afri-
can Methodist Episcopal Church, Reverend 
Mitchell and his wife Elisha have faithfully and 
selflessly guided the Spokane community for 
nearly thirty years. 
Reverend Mitchell is retiring to empower a 
new generation of leaders to continue his work 
and take the church to its next level. He 
leaves a remarkable legacy, and I’m grateful 
for the time we have spent together building 
unity in Spokane. His wisdom and perspective 
were always valued and trusted in many cou-
rageous conversations we had with diverse 
voices in our community. I’m glad that even in 
retirement, Reverend Mitchell will continue to 
serve in new ways and be a force for unity, 
security, and grace. 
Madam Speaker, Lonnie became a pastor in 
1989 following his military service in the 
United States Army. In 1991, he was assigned 
to Bethel A.M.E. by Bishop Vinton R Ander-
son. Under Reverend Mitchell’s leadership, 
Bethel A.M.E. grew from 13 members to more 
than 200. While Lonnie served from the pulpit, 
Elisha served from the choir as a gospel sing-
er. She ministered to many through her music 
and talent. During their time at Bethel A.M.E., 
Lonnie and Elisha have focused on a mission 
to love people—a mission as relevant today 
as it was in 1991. 
Reverend Mitchell and his wife Elisha have 
been long-term leaders in our community, 
helping found multiple nonprofits. In 1994, 
Lonnie and Elisha created Unity in the Com-
munity, an event to showcase Spokane’s di-
versity and unite our community around re-
spect, trust, and collaboration. In 1995, they 
founded the AHANA Business and Profes-
sional Organization, a nonprofit that supported 
minority and women-owned businesses in 
Spokane. Additionally, in the early 2000s, 
Reverend Mitchell and Elisha were key fund-
raisers for the Emmanuel Family Life Center, 
a community center in the Perry District.

September 17, 2020 
In 2018, Lonnie joined me on a Civil Rights 
pilgrimage to Alabama with the late Congress-
man John Lewis. On that pilgrimage, we 
walked the steps of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King as fellow Americans on a journey to-
gether for a more perfect union. In 2017, Lon-
nie also joined me in Washington, D.C. to 
open the House of Representatives in prayer. 
I’ll forever be grateful for the lessons I have 
learned from Reverend Mitchell. He has made 
a difference in my life and so many others. 
Madam Speaker, I join the Bethel A.M.E. 
congregation and the greater Spokane com-
munity in wishing Lonnie and Elisha Mitchell 
the best in their future endeavors. They are, 
and will continue to be, important leaders in 
our community and an example to us all. Their 
dedication and sacrifice have made them pow-
erful role models we will greatly miss; though 
we know they’re never far away. 
On behalf of the People’s House, I ask for 
everyone to join me in honoring Reverend 
Lonnie and Elisha Mitchell’s service, which I 
know will inspire generations to come.

IN HONOR OF CHIEF EDWARD K. 
WAGNER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Chief Ed Wagner, who is retiring after 
25 years of service to the citizens of New 
Hampshire. Chief Wagner served in the United 
States Marine Corps before joining the 
Conway Police Department in 1995. Through-
out his distinguished career, Chief Wagner 
has served as a patrolman, detective, ser-
geant, lieutenant, and, most recently, as the 
Chief of Police since 2005. 
Chief Wagner, a down-to-earth and sup-
portive leader, has dedicated his career with 
the Conway Police Department to protecting 
and serving Conway’s citizens and visitors. In 
retirement, Chief Wagner will be staying in 
Conway where he will spend quality time with 
his family, including his first granddaughter, 
EdynRose. 
Chief Wagner served in numerous roles at 
the Conway Police Department over the years, 
but his commitment to community service 
helped him easily adapt to the ever-changing 
environment. He approached his work with the 
utmost professionalism, integrity, and courage. 
His embodiment of these values served as a 
model to other officers and will continue to be 
a guiding principle in the Conway Police De-
partment for decades to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Chief Wagner and his family for their 
decades of dedication to our community. I 
congratulate him on his accomplished law en-
forcement career, and I wish him all the best 
in his well-deserved retirement.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today regarding votes I missed on September 
14, resulting from a family emergency, and 
September 15, 2020, due to a historic signing 
ceremony at the White House of two agree-
ments decades in the making. 
Had I been present for Roll Call Votes 183, 
H.R. 4894, the Congressional Budget Jus-
tification Act, and 184, S. 2193, the CHARGE 
Act, I would have voted yea. These bills have 
my full support, and I hope they are swiftly 
signed into law. 
Additionally, had I been present for Roll Call 
Votes 185 and 186, on ordering the previous 
question and agreeing to H. Res. 1107, re-
spectively, I would have also voted yea. The 
bills brought to the House floor by this rule are 
long overdue for consideration. In particular, 
H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act, of which I am a cosponsor, is vitally im-
portant legislation. No woman should ever be 
forced to choose between a healthy preg-
nancy and her career, but for too long, that 
has been the reality for many women. Despite 
existing laws, many workers still face preg-
nancy discrimination, including job loss, hiring 
discrimination, or an unsafe work environment. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act estab-
lishes clear, reasonable accommodations for 
pregnant employees, and further ensures that 
pregnant employees cannot be retaliated 
against, denied employment opportunities, or 
be forced to take paid or unpaid leave due to 
their pregnancy. I look forward to supporting 
this legislation, as well as others brought for-
ward by this rule.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JOHN MODDIE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life and service of John 
Moddie of Iron Mountain, Michigan. Through 
his extreme courage and selflessness, John 
has become an indispensable part of the state 
of Michigan. 
John enlisted in the United States Army in 
1942 directly following his graduation from Ni-
agara High School. After completing training at 
Fort Sheridan, Camp Roberts, and Camp 
Atterbury, John was shipped overseas to Ger-
many. He fought for three months as a part of 
a field artillery unit, where he and his fellow 
men in uniform fought to repel the last Ger-
man offensive of WWII during the Battle of the 
Bulge. John received a shrapnel wound and 
was captured on December 19, 1944. His time 
imprisoned as a POW would expose him to 
the horrific and inhumane treatment by the 
Nazis—facing severe hunger and the near 
constant fear of death. John and his fellow 
POWs would eventually be freed as Allied 
forces advanced through the region. Upon re-
turn home, John married his wife, Betty, built 
their home in Quinnesec, MI, and started their 
family. 
Observed annually on the third Friday of 
September, National POW/MIA Recognition 
Day honors those who were Prisoners of War 
and those who are still Missing in Action in 
service to their nation. We owe the men and 
women in uniform who were captured, miss-
ing, or unaccounted for a debt which can 
never be repaid. By coming together to honor 
those who stood up to defend and to serve, 
the people of Michigan’s First District can en-
sure that the service and sacrifice of those in 
uniform is never forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the service of John Moddie. Michiganders can 
take immense pride in knowing that the First 
District is home to such a selfless individual. 
On behalf of my constituents, I wish John all 
the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING DANIEL L. ‘‘DAN’’ 
GROSS 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I and the other members of the San Diego 
Congressional delegation, rise with admiration 
and respect to honor and recognize the tre-
mendous legacy of Daniel L. ‘‘Dan’’ Gross, 
who retired from Sharp HealthCare as Execu-
tive Vice President of Hospital Operations on 
April 3, 2020. 
Born in Independence, Kansas, Dan’s early 
childhood experiences created the blueprint 
for his education, career and philanthropic 
contributions. He experienced hospitals as a 
place for healing when serious medical issues 
meant repeated hospitalization for his mother. 
He was also very interested in science. His 
comparison of the hearts of five animals ‘‘off 
the farm’’ led to first place in the science fair 
when he was in 4th grade. 
Like many San Diegans, in 1979 Dan came 
to visit but decided to stay. Planning further 
education, he was attracted by California’s 
outstanding higher education system—which 
at that time was also affordable. He inter-
viewed at all the San Diego hospitals but 
chose Sharp Memorial Hospital because of its 
commitment to professionalism. 
While working his way up the clinical ladder 
at Sharp, Dan realized his graduate education 
goals earned a Masters in Nursing Administra-
tion from San Diego State University and his 
Doctorate in Nursing Sciences from the Uni-
versity of San Diego. 
The first in his family to attend college; Dan 
knows the importance of nurturing the next 
generation of health care providers. He has 
advised on curriculum at San Diego’s charter 
Health Sciences High and Middle College 
(HSHMC), and created internships at all Sharp 
hospitals for HSHMC students. 
Dan’s childhood experience on a farm also 
had a role in leading him to Sharp, where he 
was able to contribute to cutting edge re-
search in cardiac services, including Jarvik 
Hearts, transplants, and left ventricular assist 
devices. Dan’s graduate education ensured 
that nurses played critical roles during exciting 
times in clinical innovation. Patients through-
out the country have also benefited, as he has 
raised over $3 million for the American Heart/ 
Stroke Association, consistently turning out the 
largest team for the annual fundraising walk 
for research and education. 
Dan has worked at Sharp for over four dec-
ades, moving from clinical care to overseeing 
operations for four acute-care hospitals, three 
specialty hospitals including Sharp Mary Birch 
Hospital for Women & Newborns, the largest 
freestanding women’s hospital west of the

Mississippi, and Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital, 
the largest private inpatient psychiatric hospital 
in California. 
Not content with just ensuring a range of 
health care services that span cradle to hos-
pice, Dan has led efforts to improve health 
care policy, quality, and affordability through 
leadership roles with both the California Hos-
pital and the American Hospital associations. 
He has advised federal, state and local elect-
ed officials, federal and state agencies, and 
business and civic organizations. 
In retirement, Dan could not step away from 
Sharp during a major public health crisis such 
as COVID–19, therefore he has continued to 
lend his expertise and steady leadership. Dan 
continues to be involved as an active board 
member for the California Health Care Foun-
dation, an independent, nonprofit philanthropy 
that focuses on improving the health care sys-
tem for families in California. 
Dan has been a champion for access to 
high quality health care in San Diego, Cali-
fornia and the nation. He has worked tirelessly 
to expand San Diego’s health care infrastruc-
ture, provide opportunities for the next genera-
tion of health care providers, promote excel-
lence in nursing, and support science edu-
cation, research and advances in the treat-
ment of chronic diseases. Madam Speaker, 
we ask that you please join us in recognizing 
Daniel L. Gross. 
HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE 
OF 
MARINE 
CORPS 
SER-
GEANT 
DAVID 
H. 
BROWN 
OF 
TENNESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Marine Corps Ser-
geant David H. Brown for his distinguished 
service to this nation. 
Sergeant Brown joined the Marine Corps in 
1963 at the age of 17, and in 1966, he was 
sent to Vietnam as a Platoon Sergeant with 
Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines, 
3rd Marine Division. His unit participated in 
multiple operations to prevent the North Viet-
namese from assaulting South Vietnam across 
the DMZ. As a result of these operations, Ser-
geant Brown was wounded several times and 
awarded the Purple Heart. 
Sergeant Brown’s indomitable spirit and 
dedication to his fellow Marines led him to 
stay and fight with his brothers, rather than 
leaving Vietnam. On September 8, 1967, Lima 
Company came under heavy fire that killed 
one marine and wounded 28 others. With Ser-
geant Brown’s leadership, they resisted the at-
tack and were able to establish a command 
post. 
On September 10, Sergeant Brown’s pla-
toon once again took heavy fire from the NVA. 
Without hesitation, Sergeant Brown estab-
lished a defensive position and repulsed the 
enemy attack by charging them with grenades 
that momentarily disrupted the onslaught, and 
after running out of grenades, he used a 
wounded marine’s M–79 grenade launcher to 
prevent further enemy assault while simulta-
neously killing several NVA members. He then 
dragged the wounded to safety and rallied his 
men to the fight, until he was struck and killed 
by enemy fire. 
Even on the day that Sergeant Brown was 
supposed to be on a flight home, he chose to 
fight and die alongside his brothers. As a 
monument of gratitude to exemplary service 
and courageous spirit, Wayne County in Ten-
nessee has chosen to dedicate a bridge in his 
honor. On behalf of the United States Con-
gress, I wish to commend Sergeant Brown for 
his heroic service and to thank him and his 
family for making the ultimate sacrifice for 
freedom.

CLARIFYING POSITION ON H. RES.

HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 17, 2020 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
regrettably, when the electronic vote was 
taken on H. Res. 908, I was recorded incor-
rectly. I oppose all forms of discrimination 
against any American on the sole basis of 
race, color, national origin, religion, age or 
sex. I oppose this politically-motivated and 
flawed resolution and intended to vote NO. 
Furthermore, I have and will continue to speak 
openly about The Chinese Communist Party, 
their hatred of American ideals and liberty and 
their attacks on our county.’’
